<text>Easton is a town in Aroostook County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,320 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1851, the first known residence in the Easton wilderness was built by Henry Wilson, who had taught school in Presque Isle. When Solomon Bolster arrived in 1854, he joined Henry Wilson and Augustus Rackliffe, its sole residents. In 1855–1856, Noah Barker partitioned the township into 142 lots of 160 acres in size, thereby determining its layout. The state opened it for settlement and, on July 26, 1856, it was organized as the Fremont Plantation. A schoolhouse was built in 1858 and the first of several lumber mills was constructed in another year. By 1860, the population was 320. Growth of the population slowed during the Civil War, and the town of Easton was incorporated 1865. Economic growth was slow, evidenced by an 1862 record that taxes should be paid in grain or shingles. The first store was opened in 1863. A starch factory was built in 1877, and a steam shingle mill in 1879. Easton became &quot;one of the greatest potato producing towns in the County&quot;. The 1880s saw the appearance of the Methodists, Free Will Baptists and the Odd Fellows. By 1880 the population was 835; by 1890, 978.

<text>Loring Air Force Base was a United States Air Force installation in northeastern Maine, near Limestone and Caribou in Aroostook County. It was one of the largest bases of the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Strategic Air Command during its existence, and was transferred to the newly created Air Combat Command in 1992.

The base&#x27;s origins began in 1947 with an order for construction of an airfield by the New England Division of the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The chosen site, in northeastern Maine within both Limestone Township and Caswell Plantation, was the closest point in the continental U.S. to Europe, providing high strategic value during the Cold War. The base was originally named Limestone Army Air Field, and was renamed Limestone Air Force Base following the establishment of the Air Force in 1947. It was named in 1954 for Major Charles J. Loring, Jr., USAF, a Medal of Honor recipient during the Korean War. From 1951 to 1962, it was co-located next to Caribou Air Force Station.

Loring was home to a civilian population, many of whom were employed alongside active duty service members. The base included many amenities, such as a hospital, school, and ski hill, which facilitated the adjustment to Maine life by the civilians.

The 1991 Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended that Loring be closed and its aircraft and mission be distributed to other bases in the nation. The base was closed in September 1994 after over 40 years of service. It was redeveloped by the Loring Development Authority as the Loring Commerce Centre, an industrial and aviation park; the airfield is operated as Loring International Airport.

==Overview==
For the majority of its operational lifetime, Loring was a heavy bomber, aerial refueling, and interception facility for military aircraft, equipment, and supplies first as part of Strategic Air Command (SAC) (1947–1992), then as part of the succeeding Air Combat Command (ACC) (1992–1994).

Loring was planned in 1947 as Limestone Army Air Field and was designed with a capacity of over 100 B-36 Peacemaker strategic bombers. This plan was only partially completed due to budget constraints. Loring later became one of the largest air bases of SAC. After the B-36 was phased out, the B-52 Stratofortress was based at Loring, first with D models, then with B-52Gs. The Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter was also based there for a number of years, until it was replaced by the KC-135A Stratotanker.

Loring was home to many facilities that were a part of the base, or were nearby. Caribou Air Force Station was the weapons storage area that operated separately from Loring until it was absorbed in 1961. Caswell Air Force Station operated to the east, but had a unit associated with Loring before it became fully operational. On-base facilities included the Alert Area, which operated as a separate facility within Loring, due to crews being constantly stationed on alert. The Double Cantilever Hangar was the largest hangar at the facility, with the capacity to hold six parked B-52s, or five B-36s.

Another nearby installation was the GLOBECOM Communications Annex #2, located in Perham, Maine. From 1955 to 1962, it was run by the 2192nd Communications Squadron, which operated from Loring AFB.

One of Loring&#x27;s major secondary missions included serving as the headquarters for the 45th Air Division from 8 October 1954 to 18 January 1958, and on 20 November 1958. Loring&#x27;s host wing was the 42d Bombardment Wing except for a small portion of its early existence. Loring was primarily home to active duty units, although this changed in the 1980s, when the Massachusetts Air National Guard&#x27;s 101st Fighter Squadron sent a detachment to Loring. As the base was the closest in the US to Europe, it also functioned as an important stopover point.

The 1991 Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended closure of Loring AFB, and it was closed in September 1994. It was later reopened as the Loring Commerce Centre.

==Major units==

===42nd Bomb Wing===
The 42nd Bomb Wing was the host unit at Loring AFB from 1953 until 1994, supporting national security objectives with mission-ready B-52G Stratofortresses, and KC-135 Stratotanker aircraft. The wing had the ability to deploy at any time to support both SAC, and later, ACC missions. It was operational at Loring from 1953 to 1994. 
The 42nd Operations Group (OG) formerly supported national security objectives, as directed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, utilizing B-52 and KC-135 aircraft. Operational squadrons during the time of its operation at Loring included:
*69th Bombardment Squadron (B-52, 1952–1991)
*70th Bombardment Squadron (B-52, 1953–1966)
*75th Bombardment Squadron (B-52, 1953–1956)
*42d Air Refueling Squadron (KC-135, 1955–1994)
*407th Air Refueling Squadron (KC-135, 1968–1990)

All B-52s carried the &quot;LZ&quot; Tailcode. In addition to the 42nd OG, other components of the 42nd Bomb Wing were:
*42nd Organizational Maintenance Squadron
*42nd Field Maintenance Squadron
*42nd Avionics Maintenance Squadron
*42nd Munitions Maintenance Squadron
*42nd Combat Support Group
*42nd Transportation Squadron
*42nd Supply Squadron
*42nd Civil Engineer Squadron
*42nd Consolidated headquarters Squadron
*42nd Security Police Squadron
*42nd Airborne Missile Maintenance Squadron (1964–1974), responsible for maintenance of missiles that were fitted onto the B-52s
*2192nd Communications Squadron, Air Force Communications Command unit absorbed into 42nd Bomb Wing in 1990

Upon Loring&#x27;s 1994 closure, the 42nd was moved to Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama, where it became the 42nd Air Base Wing. All other squadrons of the wing were inactivated and have remained inactive, except for the 69th, which was reactivated in 2009 at Minot Air Force Base.

==History==
Loring AFB was named in 1954 for Major Charles J. Loring, Jr., USAF, a Medal of Honor recipient during the Korean War. During the morning of 22 November 1952, he led a flight of F-80 Shooting Stars on patrol over Kunwha. After beginning a dive bombing run and getting hit, he entered into a controlled dive and destroyed a Chinese gun emplacement on Sniper Ridge that was harassing United Nations troops. Limestone Air Force Base was renamed in his honor.

===Operational history===

====Origins====

Loring AFB was carved out of the woods of Maine beginning in the late forties and officially dedicated in 1953, named after Charles J. Loring, Jr., who was killed in the Korean War. The closest Air Force base on the east coast to Europe, it was originally built with a capacity of 100 B-36 Peacemaker bombers and equipped with a runway.

Loring was built on of land, making it the biggest SAC base in the country. This in turn allowed for it to have the largest capacity for weapon storage and for fuel storage in all of SAC. (Its overall capacity ranked second among all 21 SAC bases). The weapons storage capacity was the highest in all of SAC, 10,247,882 NEW (Net Explosive Weight), and it was first in all of SAC in fuel storage capacity (9,193,374 gallons). Fuel was delivered to the base via a 200-mile pipeline to Searsport, Maine. Ramp space at Loring exceeded 1.1 million square yards, which made it second among all SAC bases in total ramp space, and first in excess ramp space. Furthermore, it was one of two fully capable conventional weapons storage facilities in CONUS maintained by SAC.

During the Cold War, new U.S. Air Force bases were constructed along the northern border of the continental U.S.; their most direct route to the Soviet Union was through the Arctic Circle. These sites were high-importance strategic bases for hosting long-range missiles and aircraft. In 1947, the New England Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers chose a site in northeastern Maine, within both the Limestone Township and Caswell Plantation. The remote site consisted mostly of dense forest, shallow marshes, and wild blueberry bogs, on a slight plateau over the town, which helped keep it above the fog most of the time. Only a small part of the base was suitable for farming, so there was little impact on Aroostook County&#x27;s agricultural community. Additionally, Loring was not far from sources of materials for runway, taxiway, and parking apron construction. The most important benefit of the site was that it was a few hundred miles closer than any other base to potential targets in Europe.

====Construction====

On 15 April 1947, construction commenced on Limestone Army Air Field, the first Strategic Air Command base designed and built to host high-speed aircraft, including the new B-36 Peacemaker. Original plans for Limestone called for two parallel north−south runways, a east−west runway, and accommodations for over 100 aircraft. The multimillion-dollar project was not built to the specifications of the original Army Corps of Engineers plan, and only one north−south runway was constructed.

On 23 May, a $17 million contract was awarded to two companies to complete the first phase of construction. This included the north−south runway, a parallel taxiway (Taxiway J), a parking apron, the Arch Hangar, a base operations building, a control tower, a power plant, a 250-person barracks (which would later become Building 6000), a water supply system, and a railroad spur to the base from the Bangor and Aroostook Railroad).

One of the first structures was the Arch Hangar. At the time, it was the largest monolithic arch roof structure in the US, and one of the largest hangars in the world. The construction of the hangar was also groundbreaking, including a foundation set on bedrock, extensive footing structures, intricate formwork, and a 340-foot arch span.

The runway was another major construction task. The airfield in northern Maine was subject to freeze-thaw cycles and had bogs and various types of groundcover; 2.1 million cubic yards of material was removed. The foundation of the runway was constructed to a depth of of a flexible bituminous-concrete pavement. This was all done on a runway that was in length and wide.

The month of June 1950 began 44 years of constant activity at Limestone. On 10 June, the 7 officers and 78 airmen of the Limestone Detachment arrived, as the tenant unit during construction. Two days later, an aircraft from Oklahoma arrived. On the 15th, limited operations began at Limestone, as Cold War tensions began to heat up. The next day, a B-36 Peacemaker arrived and later departed. 1 July brought the re-designation of the Limestone Detachment as the 4215th Base Service Squadron. After the Korean War broke out, the decision was made to increase the squadron&#x27;s size to 28 officers, 340 airmen, and 20 civilians. August brought the first permanently assigned aircraft, a C-47 Skytrain, and more aircraft using the base as a stopover between the States and Europe.

The war brought increased funding to Limestone in 1951. Eight additional hangars were constructed at the southwestern end of the runway, as well as a addition to the northern end of the runway. The Department of Defense allocated funds for the North River Depot, a weapons storage facility to the northwest of the base. It later became Caribou Air Force Station and was absorbed into the facility in the 1960s. The end of the year brought the completion of a communications facility, a hospital, three barracks, a school, an officers club, a bakery, and a briefing and training building. The base was one of the first constructed after World War II and also one of the first to retain as much surrounding vegetation as possible in case there was a need to camouflage the airfield and surrounding facilities. It avoided the traditional grid system for roads.

Hangars were built for the additional aircraft at the base, including the double cantilever hangar, one of the first built by the Air Force in response to a demand for more efficient maintenance space. It could house five B-36 Peacemakers and six B-52 Stratofortresses, and nine planned concrete arch hangars were no longer needed.

The runway was resurfaced in 1955 in anticipation of the arrival of the B-52 Stratofortress in 1956. Eighteen additional &quot;nose-dock&quot; hangars (hangars which could contain the nose and wings of the aircraft, allowing for maintenance to the cockpit area by the crew, without the need to use the larger hangars) were built in 1956 to the northwest of the runway, near the main parking area, along with parking areas and taxiways for these hangars.

====Early history====

On 8 February 1953, Curtis E. Lemay, Commander of SAC, visited the base to review the construction&#x27;s progress. During this visit, he indicated that Limestone was operationally ready. Later that month, command capabilities were formally transferred to SAC, ending an almost six-year command by the Army Corps of Engineers. Furthermore, personnel of the 4215th Base Service Squadron were reassigned to the 42d Bombardment Wing, which was reactivated and assigned to the 8th Air Force. On 23 February, Limestone Air Force Base officially became operational.

During the first few months, the wing was not assigned any aircraft, and thus worked with other units who were in possession of the B-36 Peacemaker. In March and April, the base began preparing for operations of the B-36, which arrived later in April. This gave the newly activated 69th Bombardment Squadron a full complement of aircraft. By the end of August, the number had increased to 27 bombers, 322 officers, 313 airmen, and 350 civilians. Additionally, more buildings were constructed on base, making it more of a home for airmen and their families.

January 1954 brought the declaration of the 42nd being capable of implementing its Emergency War Plan. On 1 October, the base was renamed after Charles Loring Jr., and became &quot;Loring Air Force Base&quot;. One week later, the 45th Air Division was activated at Loring and designated the primary base unit. It was also designated that month as the primary staging location for fighter aircraft flying out of the Continental United States to and from Europe. Loring had 63 permanent aircraft assigned, and air traffic was significantly increased.

As the Cold War progressed, so did the need for new aircraft and techniques. The first KC-97 Stratofreighter arrived at Loring with the activation of the 42d Air Refueling Squadron in January 1955. The B-36s were not actually equipped to perform aerial refueling, so the planes supported other units until the arrival of the B-52 in 1956. Eventually, 21 tankers were based at Loring, along with 30 air crews.

By 1955, the base consisted of the 42d, 69th, 70th, and the 75th Bombardment Squadrons. A hospital became operational. The next January, a B-52 landed at the airfield as part of a cold weather testing program. Five months later, the first Stratofortress, the &quot;State of Maine&quot;, was permanently stationed at Loring.

In November 1956, the Air Force used the base for publicity. On 10 November, the Soviet Union threatened to oust British and French troops from the Middle East, days after the end of the Suez Crisis. After a response by president Dwight D. Eisenhower to the United Nations, a reporter with the Associated Press visited Castle Air Force Base in California after SAC was alerted to support whatever action the U.S. might take. The reporter was unable to find classified information, and instead invented maintenance records of the fleet that painted a dismal picture. On 24 and 25 November, four B-52s of the 93rd Bombardment Wing and the 42nd flew nonstop around the perimeter of North America in Operation Quick Kick, which covered in 31 hours, 30 minutes. SAC noted the flight time could have been reduced by 5 to 6 hours if the four inflight refuelings had been done by fast jet-powered tanker aircraft rather than propeller-driven KC-97 Stratofreighters. After the flight ended, the planes landed at Friendship International Airport. The operation distracted public attention from the reporter&#x27;s story.

The base was also the location of an experimental system of steam pipes in 1957, to test the viability of using steam to melt the snow on the runways. Pipes were spaced at different intervals in the experiment. That same year, the first KC-135 Stratotanker, christened the &quot;Aroostook Queen&quot;, arrived at Loring. By December, all of the KC-97s had left, and by April 1958, 20 KC-135s had arrived, allowing the 42nd Air Refueling Squadron to reach full operational capacity in May. Later that year, an alert force was created at Loring, consisting of six B-52s. The following year, in response to a conflict in Lebanon, the entire wing was placed on alert.

An Alert Force was established at Loring AFB in October 1957. The wing began supporting the force with six B-52s in January 1958. In response to a conflict in Lebanon, the Alert Force was expanded to include the entire bombardment wing in July 1958, when the SAC bomber force went to full alert status. SAC&#x27;s overall goal was achieved in 1960.

On 11 March 1958, base personnel were the first members of the Air Force to land a B-52 in a wheels-up configuration at Westover AFB near Springfield, Massachusetts. After being lifted up and onto its wheels, the plane was flown to Kelly AFB at San Antonio, Texas, for a complete overhaul and inspection, before it was returned to the 42nd.

Loring was also home to an administrations support base of a Green Pine communications crew from Naval Station Argentia. The detachment did not officially exist on the base, although it was located on the top floor of the Bachelors Officers Quarters and consisted of six men.

=====Assigned aircraft=====
Various aircraft were assigned to the base, including the B-36 Peacemaker, which was assigned to the 42d Bombardment Wing from 1 April 1953 to 6 September 1956; the KC-97G Stratotanker, which was assigned from 15 February 1955 to 16 December 1957; the B-52C Stratofortress, which was assigned 16 June 1956 to January 1957; the |KC-135A Stratotanker, which was assigned from 16 October 1957 to 7 May 1990; the B-52G, which was assigned from January 1957 to 16 November 1993; and the KC-135R, which was assigned from 1990 to March 1994.

Fighter aircraft were also assigned to the base during its operation. The F-102 Delta Dagger, which was assigned to the 27th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, was located on base from 1957 to 1960 while the F-106 Delta Dart was assigned from 16 October 1959 to 1 July 1971, and to the 83d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron from July 1971 to June 1972.

On July 31, 2024, B-52 60-0012 from the 69th Bomb Squadron from Minot Air Force Base landed at Loring after some 30 years since the ceasation of B-52 operations from the base and to honor the 42nd Bomber Wing. The event on this occasions was to celebrate not only the history of the 42nd Bomber Wing but a Loring Open House Event that was being held.

=====Weapons Storage Area=====
The Nuclear Weapons Storage Area at Loring once operated as a separate, top secret facility. Originally called the North River Depot, the remote area to the northeast of Loring&#x27;s property was the first U.S. operational site specifically constructed for the storage, assembly, and testing of atomic weapons.

In 1951, the Department of Defense (DOD) allocated funds for the construction of an ordnance storage site at Loring AFB. The designs called for a self-sufficient &quot;maximum security storage area for the most advanced weapons of mankind&quot;. The mission of the facility would be the protection and maintenance of the weapons used by SAC. The facility was in the northeast corner of the base, and construction began on 4 August 1951. In addition to 28 storage igloos and other weapons storage structures, the facility included weapons maintenance buildings, barracks, recreational facilities, a warehouse, and offices.

A parallel series of four fences, one of which was electrified, surrounded the heart of the storage area. This area was nicknamed the &quot;Q&quot; Area, which denoted the Department of Energy&#x27;s Q clearance required to have access to Restricted Data.

In June 1962, the Atomic Energy Commission released its custody and ownership of the weapons to the Air Force. The personnel and property of the later named Caribou Air Force Station were absorbed into the adjacent Loring Air Force Base.

=====Nike defense area=====
To provide air defense of the base, four United States Army Nike-Hercules surface-to-air missile sites were constructed during 1956. Sites were located near Caribou (L-58) ; Caswell (L-13) ; Connor Twp. (L-85) , and Limestone (L-31) Maine.

The New England Division of the Army Corps of Engineers managed the construction of these sites. The sites were manned by men from the 3rd Missile Battalion, 61st Air Defense Artillery Regiment, and provided defense for Loring and the northeastern approaches to the United States. In 1960, sites L-13 and L-58 underwent conversion from Ajax missiles to the MIM-14 Nike-Hercules missiles. These sites remained operational until 1966, although the site at Limestone was closed in September 1958.

Members of the 3rd Missile Battalion gained distinction in November 1958 during the Annual Service Practice wargames at Fort Bliss in Texas when they launched 12 Nike Ajax missiles and recorded 12 kills – a United States Army Air Defense Command first.

=====Operation Head Start=====

Operation Head Start was conducted at the base from September to December 1958. It helped to demonstrate that a continuous airborne alert could be maintained successfully.

Before each flight, a briefing was held, alerting the crewmembers to basic world events as well as safety criteria. At least 15 hours before takeoff, the crew would thoroughly pre-flight their aircraft. Inadvertently, this also increased efficiency in terms of maintenance and other pre-flight routines.

Every six hours, a bomber would take off with live warheads and continue on a pre-determined path over Greenland and eastern Canada, a trip ending 20 hours later. Frequently, &quot;Foxtrot: No message required&quot; messages were sent to the bomber from Strategic Air Command headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base, keeping the crews alert.

While entering the landing pattern, crash trucks would travel to the runway and await landing. This was standard procedure for all Head Start landings. After landing, the crew was interrogated prior to being released, so that maintenance, intelligence, and other crews could be alerted to the performance of the plane and other items that the crew might have noticed during their flight. After release, they would typically go to the Physical Conditioning room for a steam bath and rubdown.

Operation Head Start eventually led to Operation Chrome Dome. Chrome Dome was an operation where bombers would be in constant airborne alert and loiter at points just outside the Soviet Union.

====Second-half of the Cold War====
Although it is unknown when it was opened, Loring was host to a Conventional Enhanced Release Training bomb range, which was located adjacent to the runway. Loring was one of four Strategic Air Command bases with a range of this type, and it was used frequently. The base was also located next to Condor 1 and Condor 2 airspace, which allowed for low-level training. The routes and training opportunities within the restricted airspace allowed training to be accomplished. One disadvantage of the location of Loring was its distance from the Strategic Training Route Complex and bombing ranges in Nevada and Utah. The western ranges were the only location where the B-52s were allowed to drop live munitions. SAC training required crews to drop live munitions twice a year on these ranges.

In 1974, President Richard Nixon stopped at Loring on 3 July in Air Force One (SAM 27000) as he returned from a summit in Moscow, where he and Leonid Breshnev had signed the Threshold Test Ban Treaty. In a speech in front of 5,000 people in the double cantilever hangar, he talked about the importance of the treaty. President and Mrs. Nixon were welcomed home by vice president Gerald R. Ford, who flew from Washington. His daughter Julie Nixon Eisenhower was also in attendance. Nixon resigned from office five weeks later.

On 11 March 1976, SAC headquarters announced that the 42d Bombardment Wing would be inactivated, citing the poor condition of Loring&#x27;s facilities. In 1976, it was estimated that Loring needed up to $300 million in facilities improvements. Between 1976 and 1979, considerable debate took place over the strategic importance of Loring, resulting in a reversal of the Air Force decision to close Loring. When the decision to keep Loring AFB open was made in 1979, Congress committed itself to upgrading Loring&#x27;s facilities. After 1981, nearly $300 million in military construction and operations and maintenance funds were spent to upgrade the facilities. Congressman Tip O&#x27;Neill of Massachusetts and Senator William Cohen of Maine were firm supporters of the base during the time when it was proposed to be closed.

During the time that Loring was proposed for closure, the region experienced economic uncertainty. Once the Air Force made its intent known in 1976, property values plummeted, and people delayed buying homes, fearing that they would need to relocate. The reduction in the base of around 80% meant that possibly 60% of Aroostook County would need to relocate, according to county officials. A $25,000 study, commissioned by the Department of Labor and conducted at Northeastern University, calculated that the region had lost over $14 million in these three years of economic uncertainty.

In 1981, Loring&#x27;s bombers were placed on alert after Soviet submarines were spotted off the coast of the region. The base was briefly mentioned in the 1983 movie WarGames, although the film erroneously listed Loring as being home to the 43rd Bombardment Wing. In 1982, the base was hit by two earthquakes, which damaged the base hospital and caused cracks to appear on the walls of the control tower.

On 5 September 1983, members of the 42d Air Refueling Squadron escorted a crippled F-4E Phantom II over the Atlantic Ocean after it experienced the loss of an engine. For its actions, crew E-113 received the Mackay Trophy for refueling it four times and towing it with its refueling boom.

The 5th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron based at Minot AFB in North Dakota maintained a detachment of three F-15 Eagles at Loring. When the 5th was inactivated in 1987, F-4 Phantom IIs from the Minnesota Air National Guard&#x27;s 148th Fighter-Interceptor Group&#x27;s 179th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron sent a detachment to Loring. After the detachment left, the Massachusetts Air National Guard&#x27;s 102nd Fighter Interceptor Wing&#x27;s 101st Fighter-Interceptor Squadron deployed F-15s to the base, the same ones that were part of the 5th. A second north–south runway, one that had been in the Loring&#x27;s original plans, was created on Taxiway J as a &quot;pre-launch survivability&quot; runway. This made Loring one of three SAC bases with two runways.

In 1988, the Air Force decided to close three of its nuclear weapons stations at its SAC bases. In addition to Loring, other bases around the world were scaled back. As the B-1B Lancer was now predicted to become the mainstay of nuclear defense for the country, Loring was deemed unnecessary for nuclear weapons stationing. That same year, fears began to surface that Loring would be an on the list of the 1988 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. As a result, the community began to rally around the base, which at the time included 3,800 military personnel, 1,000 civilian employees, generated an $80 million payroll the previous year, and was the subject of $34 million in construction services.

In 1989, it was proposed to list Loring on the Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s National Priorities List. This was due to the presence of waste oil, fuel, solvents, and pesticides in the soil. Additionally, the burning of waste also created problems, in addition to the use of landfills in old gravel pits on site. The fire training area also needed remediation, as materials were burned there until 1974. Loring was officially added to the list in February 1990.

During Operation Desert Storm, Loring&#x27;s tankers were responsible for refueling aircraft transiting the Atlantic. It was also used as a stopover for aircraft travelling to the Persian Gulf region due to its vital position. The base was vital because it allowed aircraft maintenance, as some would be unable to reach their destination without maintenance. Between 2 August 1990 and 10 May 1991, more than 1,700 aircraft transiting between America and the Persian Gulf region landed at Loring. These included the C-141 Starlifter, C-5 Galaxy, C-130 Hercules, C-21A, A-4 Skyhawk, A-10 Thunderbolt II, Boeing 707, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F/A-18 Hornet, F-111 Aardvark, P-3 Orion, TR-1A Dragonlady, U-2 Dragonlady, B-52 Stratofortress, KC-10 Extender, KC-135 Stratotanker, E-3A Sentry, EA-6B Mercury, and E-8A Joint Stars aircraft.

=====UFO sighting=====
During the fall of 1975, the base was the location of unidentified flying object sightings. During the night of 27 October, an unidentified object was spotted hovering near the secure weapons area (the former Caribou AFS). Around 19:45, a member of the 42nd Security Police Squadron spotted an apparent aircraft over the northern perimeter of Loring, at a low altitude. A later teletype message to the National Military Command Center in Washington, D.C., stated: &quot;The A/C [aircraft] definitely penetrated the LAFB [Loring Air Force Base] northern perimeter and on one occasion was within of the munitions storage area perimeter.&quot; In the control tower, a member of the 2192nd Communications Squadron was on duty, when he picked up the craft on radar, nearing the base. After trying to contact the unidentified aircraft to warn it that it was approaching a restricted area, the aircraft entered the airspace over the nuclear weapons storage area and hovered over it at an altitude of , later lowering to . Commander of the 42d Bombardment Wing, Colonel Robert E. Chapman[./Loring_Air_Force_Base#cite_note-43 [N 1]] arrived 15 minutes later at the weapons storage area and police units were ordered in as well. At this time, he also declared a Security Option 3.

At 20:45, another person on duty in the control tower received a call to track the mysterious craft on radar. For the next 40 minutes, it was observed circling around the weapons storage area, when it suddenly vanished, as though it had landed or dropped below the radar. Witnesses later observed it flying away towards Grand Falls, New Brunswick, twelve miles to the east. Messages were sent to the National Military Command Center, the Air Force Chief of Staff, and Strategic Air Command headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base. The base continued to remain on a high state of alert until the following morning, as efforts to identify the unidentified aircraft through the Maine State Police, local police departments, and the Houlton Federal Aviation Administration office remained elusive.

The next night at 19:45, a craft similar to the one the night before approached the base. In addition to being tracked on radar, it hovered around the area for 30 minutes, with characteristics of movement similar to a helicopter. It hovered above the weapons storage area at the same altitude as the night before. At this time, possibly another object (it is unclear if it was the same one as the over the weapons storage area, but it is possible) was spotted over the flightline. The cigar-shaped object was described as hovering in mid-air, jerking around, and turning on and off its lights once. During the blackout, it traveled from the flightline, to the northern end of the runway. According to one service member, the object was chased, and eventually discovered to be hovering five feet off the ground. During this time, it was determined that the object was four car lengths long.

Once again, the object was tracked on radar, taking off towards New Brunswick. Teletype messages were again sent to higher commands, with no explanation being found. One teletype sent on November from Loring&#x27;s Office of Special Investigations detachment to the National Military Command Center and OSI headquarters reported another, &quot;unidentified helicopter sighted at low level over Loring AFB&quot; over the past two nights (31 October – 1 November). It also referred to the intruder as an &quot;unknown entity.&quot; Additionally, Captain Richard R. Fuhs an Operations Officer in the 42nd Security Police Squadron (SPS) stated, &quot;... advised that there had been three verified sightings of an unidentified A/C [aircraft] flying at low level over and in the vicinity of LAFB&quot; during this period. An initial sighting was made by a member of the 42nd, who was on duty at 23:14 hours Another member spotted the object near the East Gate, going from east to west.

It has been learned that another member of the 2192nd Communications Squadron working at the Caswell Radar Station had been contacted by the base commander to look toward the base and report what he sees. That member responded, I see a helicopter with people rappelling out of it. To quote him, &quot;I never saw a UFO, but I did see a helicopter&quot;. This incident was a base readiness security drill that has been passed off as a UFO sighting.

=====BRAC 1991 and closure=====

In 1991, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, upon the recommendation of Secretary of the Air Force Donald B. Rice, identified Loring and five other SAC bases for closure through the BRAC Commission. The commission recommended that the 42d Bomb Wing be disestablished, and the B-52Gs transferred to the 410th Bomb Wing at K.I. Sawyer AFB near Marquette, Michigan. The KC-135 aircraft were realigned to USAF Reserve and other active units.

The justification for the closure of Loring was that the Air Force had six more strategic bases than were needed to support the number of bomber and tanker aircraft in the Defense Department&#x27;s Structure Plan. The base was evaluated against eight selection criteria and a large number of subelements specific to Air Force bases and missions. Although Loring was in good condition and had strong community support, it ranked low in the criteria when compared to 20 other bases in the strategic category. One item that hurt Loring was its limited peacetime value as a tanker base, as well as its distance from bombing ranges. The commission did note that the facilities at Loring were above average, and the cost to close Loring would be low, the latter which contributed to its closure.

The commission also projected an impact on the future of the community; 22,000 people were projected to leave the region with 9,900 direct and indirect jobs affected, and a loss of over $92 million of regional income. This was in contrast to a regional population of over 49,100, available jobs of 33,320, and an annual income of $755 million. The net savings by the end of 1997 from closing the base was $182 million, or about $61.8 million annually.

As the Cold War ended, so did the mission of SAC, and it was disestablished on 1 June 1992. The last B-52 departed Loring in November 1993, and ceremonies were held in February 1994 to celebrate the end of the flying mission. The following month saw the last KC-135 depart and after 41 years, Loring AFB officially closed on 30 September 1994.

===Accidents and incidents===

On 22 November 1958, a B-47B Stratojet commanded by Captain Robert Lee Shaffer crashed while taking off from Loring, killing all four crewmembers on board. The plane (s/n 51-2199) belonged to the 446th Bomber Squadron of the 321st Bombardment Wing at McCoy Air Force Base (named Pinecastle AFB at the time) in Orlando, Florida. The plane was described as having reached two-thirds of the way down the runway, when it veered sharply to the right, eventually crashing 400 feet north of the runway.

On 25 November 1958, a KC-135 Stratotanker of the 42d Air Refueling Squadron crashed on takeoff roughly in the same area as the B-47 three days before. Two crewmembers were thrown to safety by the impact of the crash. The Air Force stated that after a four-hour mission, the crewmembers were practicing taking off and landing on the runway.

On 18 November 1960, a KC-135 crashed upon landing at Loring, killing one and injuring sixteen others. The plane landed after a six-and-a-half-hour training mission, veered off to the left of the runway, and skidded three thousand feet while on fire. Surviving crewmembers were able to use the emergency chutes to evacuate the plane safely.

On 9 May 1962, six crewmembers of a KC-135 were killed when their plane crashed during takeoff into a surrounding marsh, about fifteen hundred feet north of the runway.

On 4 January 1965, four crewmembers were killed three miles north of Loring when their KC-135 crashed into the ground after takeoff.

On 5 September 1969, a B-52 Stratofortress crashed approximately three miles north of the runway after taking off. Seven men were killed, including six crewmembers, during a Minimum Interval Takeoff drill.

On 4 October 1989 a KC-135 crash killed all 4 crewmembers. The jet, which crashed about 2.4 miles off the TransCanada Highway in New Brunswick, was attempting to land at Loring.

Loring also had its share of incidents that did not result in fatalities over the years. On 6 March 1955, a B-36 Peacemaker crashed and burned in a snowbank at Loring. All crewmembers were able to escape unharmed.

On 26 June 1958, a B-52D (55‑0102) burned on the ground at Loring and was destroyed.

On 25 May 1969, a KC-135A (56–3602) broke in two after aborting takeoff. The cause was a frozen water injection surge tube.

On 19 July 1970, a B-52G (58‑0208) also caught on fire and was destroyed on the ground.

===Base culture and civilian life===
Families at the base were able to take advantage of many of the opportunities provided for them, as life at Loring was not all military-related. Although Loring was constructed with support facilities including a hospital, chapel, and schools, other forms of civilian life were added over the years as well.

====Education====
Younger students on the base attended Damon Elementary School or Harrison Elementary School. Kindergarten-age children would attend school in either morning or afternoon sessions, and the older students were given the standard fare of lunch offerings. School educators were rated highly in the state. Students in grades 7 through twelve attended the nearby Limestone High School.

To those who were no longer in secondary education, there were opportunities as well. The Northern Maine Vocational Technical Institute offered courses that would help students with introductory college-level classes. Husson College offered credits to those working to earn an associate&#x27;s or baccalaureate degree in business. The nearby University of Maine at Presque Isle offered classes in the social and behavioral sciences, as well as humanities and liberal studies. Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University offered a bachelor&#x27;s degree in professional aeronautics. Credits earned through these programs counted as &quot;on campus&quot; or &quot;residential credit&quot; to those who were enrolled in them. Additionally, day, evening, and night classes were offered in nearby Caribou and Presque Isle.

For those seeking a graduate degree, the University of Denver offered a twelve course program leading to a Master of Science degree in systems management. Embry-Riddle offered three graduate degrees, including the Master of Aeronautical Science. The University of Maine at Presque Isle offered a Master of Public Administration as well.

The base&#x27;s Education Center also provided testing service for those interested in taking exams. It provided the CLEP, DANTES Exams, SAT, ACT, the LSAT and GRE exams. The Community College of the Air Force also enrolled active duty personnel in its programs as well. Credits taken there could be transferred to other affiliated Air Force technical institutions, and personnel could qualify for commissioning programs.

====Healthcare====
The Loring Air Force Base Hospital had two buildings during its operation. The first, Building 3500, which was known as the &quot;Green Monster,&quot; was damaged during an earthquake on 9 January 1982. The two earthquakes, which were centered in Miramichi, New Brunswick caused irreparable structural damage to the facility, which led to it being replaced with a sturdier hospital in 1987. The new hospital included a dental clinic and outpatient rooms, in addition to over twenty beds. Internal medicine, optometry, general surgery, pediatrics, mental health, and radiology services were also provided at the base, in addition to the 24-hour emergency support services. Veterinary services were also offered in a separate building to base personnel and their families.

====Family services====
Military members adjusting to Loring had many facilities available to them. This included the Family Service Center, the Family Services Lending Closet, and the Corey Center.

The base was served by an independent bank, and included help for many types of financial needs, and an ATM. The County Federal Credit Union was located right outside the facility, and helped supplement the bank itself.

Shopping at Loring could be completed at the Maine Exchange Shopping Mall, which was designed as a one-stop shop for the shopping needs of the residents. Goods could also be purchased at the base commissary as well, which included a Class VI store.

Loring had a non-denominational chapel, which helped to welcome new members to the base. Services were offered to those of the Roman Catholic, Protestant denominations and Judaic faiths. Members of the chapel also provided food for those who ate in Loring&#x27;s dining hall, and helped to share the word of God to those who were believers.

The base also came with its own newspaper, named &quot;Limelite&quot;. The on-base newspaper helped to provide readers with information on the USAF and Strategic Air Command, as well as information on the events happening around the facility.

The main dining hall on base was named Dahlgren Hall, after Maine native Edward Dahlgren, who was a recipient of the Medal of Honor for his actions in World War II.

====Leisure activities====
For leisure, the area surrounding Loring offered many options. Many recreation areas and campgrounds were located in and around the base region, with some being 200 miles away. The Morale Welfare and Recreation center offered equipment for these outings, including fishbait and tackle and boat rentals. Loring&#x27;s bowling center was 22 lanes, one of the most modern in the area. The base library loaned books to both residents and students alike.

A small downhill ski area provided recreation for personnel and their dependents, operating on the base from the early 1960s until Loring&#x27;s closure in 1994. This ski chalet included a lighted skating rink and could be used for local events. The base offered trips to regional ski resorts periodically, and cross country skiing was offered at the local golf course.

The base contained a Noncommissioned Officers Club and an Officers Club. The Noncommissioned Officers Club, or Club 42 as it was known, admitted all military members and civilians up the GS-7. Many varieties of food were offered there. It could be used for live entertainment, in addition to the booking of parties. The Visiting Officers Quarters and the Unaccompanied Officers Quarters were nearby, hence the club was a convenient stopover for transient officers.

==Current status==
Loring AFB was set to close as a result of the 1991 Base Realignment and Closure Commission, officially closing on 30 September 1994. Immediately, Limestone was decimated. The population of Limestone dropped 76%, from 10,000 to 2,000, in the six years following the base&#x27;s closure. Regional economic activity was severely lowered, as 19% of the local economy was related to Loring Air Force Base.

One of the more immediate ideas for redevelopment of the base was to turn it into a federal prison, something which had been done previously at the former Carswell AFB in Texas when the Federal Medical Center, Carswell was opened on its grounds. Many other former Air Force facilities have had prisons opened on their grounds as well. From the outset, there was some reluctance in the town about creating a prison culture in Limestone, but this was lessened once the government decided not to build a federal prison there.

In 1998, the former base was considered for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places, as previous studies had found that 88 buildings were eligible for inclusion on the list, including the base&#x27;s arch hangar.

In 1997 the rock band Phish held a two-day concert dubbed &quot;The Great Went&quot;, taking place on 16 and 17 August. The world&#x27;s largest fire truck hosed down thousands of fans as they arrived Saturday morning, and on Sunday morning, approximately 1,100 people posed nude as part of a 50 state tour by photographer Spencer Tunick. Phish was the only band that played the main stage, performing seven sets over two nights, including a late night disco set at 2:30 AM featuring all four members on keyboards. The Bangor Symphony Orchestra performed Debussy and Stravinsky during the afternoon of the second day, accompanied by a glider pilot who soared above the audience. 75,000 people attended, making the event Phish&#x27;s largest concert up to that point, and the top-grossing rock concert in the United States in the summer of 1997. Fans camped out onsite in tents and RVs, making Limestone the largest city in Maine over the weekend.
Phish again staged a weekendlong concert, this time called &quot;Lemonwheel&quot;, on 15 and 16 August 1998. 60,000 people attended creating a community of fans that, again, made Limestone one of the largest cities in Maine over the weekend.

Phish played a third weekendlong concert at the base called the &quot;IT Festival&quot;, on 2 and 3 August 2003. 60,000 people attended and again, Phish was the only band at the event, performing seven sets over two nights, including a late night ambient set atop of the air traffic control tower at 2:30 AM after the first night&#x27;s concert.

On 31 July 2024, Loring Air Force Base commemorated the 30th anniversary of the base&#x27;s closure, featuring the arrival of a B-52 Stratofortress and various activities for attendees. The event was held to recognize the historical significance of the 42nd Bomber Wing and the base&#x27;s role during the Cold War.

The Loring Development Authority created the Loring Commerce Centre on of the site. It was marketed as an &quot;excellent solution for your business real estate needs at a very reasonable cost.&quot; Bigelow Aerospace maintains a call center at Loring. In addition to the Sitel site (no longer present), other call centers exist on the former base, as well as food processing, forestry operations, light manufacturing, and aviation services. The military has made a return to Loring over the years through the Defense Finance and Accounting Service Limestone office, a major component of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service. The 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission consolidated DFAS&#x27; 26 offices into 5, with Loring being one of the consolidation points. This facility is located in the old base hospital.

Cleanup continued at the base, including the removal of hazardous materials, which prevented further waste from entering the nearby Greenlaw Brook, as it received drainage from the flightline and nose dock areas.

==Demographics==

During the 1970s, the population of the base declined due to the possible closure of the base and the draw down in personnel from the Vietnam War. In 1972, the base&#x27;s population was around 12,000, while in 1975 the population was 10,758. In 1978, 9,233 persons resided on the base, which declined to 8,116 the next year.

As of the census of 2000, there were 225 people, 82 households, and 57 families residing on the former base. The population density was 27.4/mi2 (10.6/km2). There were 355 housing units at an average density of 43.2/mi2 (16.7/km2). The racial makeup of the base was 81.33% White, 10.22% African American, 2.22% Asian, 5.33% from other races, and 0.89% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 13.78% of the population.

<text>Mars Hill is a town in Aroostook County, Maine, United States, nestled at the foot of Mars Hill Mountain. The town borders Wicklow Parish, New Brunswick, Canada. The region is mainly agricultural. The population was 1,360 at the time of the 2020 census.

==History==

===Timeline of events===

The town of Mars Hill is named for Hezekiah Mars, who camped for three years at the base of Mars Hill Mountain. In 1834, the first industry was cutting timber, particularly trees for masts. Farming later became important. Following the end of the Aroostook War in 1839, a boundary line between Maine and New Brunswick was cleared and iron markers were put in place three years later. The first mill opened at Rocky Brook in 1856. In 1860, the first school was established for the community of Mars Hill. Further development of the community was delayed until after the American Civil War. The Bangor and Aroostook Railroad arrived in 1892, allowing shipment of local produce to distant markets.

In 1906, the White Mountain Telephone Company, later known as the Aroostook Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, opened a new office in Mars Hill. A six-bed community hospital was established in 1912. In 1922, an intense fire devastated the business district in town. Businesses were promptly rebuilt. In 1937, the Walter T.A. Hansen Memorial Library opened. In the 1960s, Big Rock Ski Area was founded on Mars Hill Mountain.

In 2006, Maine&#x27;s first wind farm was installed along the top and northern side of Mars Hill Mountain.

During and after World War II, Mars Hill and the economies of surrounding towns were dominated by military spending. In 1947, the Limestone Army Air Field was built in Limestone. It opened in 1953 and was renamed the Loring Air Force Base. Aroostook County was chosen due to its strategic location as the closest point in the continental United States to Europe. The 1991 Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended the closure of the Loring Air Force Base, and it closed in 1994.

===Big Rock Ski Area===

During the late 1950s, two hundred acres were purchased to develop a local recreation area, and by 1960 the Big Rock Ski Area was opened. Big Rock Ski Center was purchased in 2000 by the Maine Winter Sports Center (MWSC), through grants by the Libra Foundation.

===Wind power development===

On March 27, 2007, a wind farm project was commissioned to be constructed on Mars Hill Mountain by First Wind, a Massachusetts-based renewable energy company. The Mars Hill Wind Farm was projected to have cost $85 million. A total of 28 General Electric 1.5 megawatt turbines were installed along the ridge and in the northern section of the mountain. The wind 
farm generates about 130 million kilowatt hours (kW·h) per year (15 MW·yr/yr), with a capacity factor of 35%. Mars Hill Wind Farm was the first utility-scale facility in Maine, with projected capacity to produce enough electricity to power 20,000 homes. Mars Hill Wind Farm exports electricity to New Brunswick Power and has become an important component in the local economy.

<text>Monticello is a town in Aroostook County, Maine, United States on the northern branch of the Meduxnekeag River. The population was 737 at the 2020 census. History

== History ==
Originally known as Wellington Township, Monticello was settled in 1830 by General Joel Wellington, who owned it, and incorporated in 1846.

Some of the earlier migrant workers of Monticello were called the “Amerisee”—a currently disbanded tribe whose members consisted of tribal people from all five Wabanaki Maine tribes, who traveled together as migrant seasonal workers. Many of them had settled in the Monticello and other Aroostook County areas. The word “Amerisee” comes from the Mi’kmaq word “Amase’jijg” which means “some distance” or “quite far” in reference to the distance they traveled for work, which often included all areas of Canada and Aroostook County Maine. The Matthew(s) family shows up in the 1900 Census for Monticello Maine. They had intended to form a sixth tribe—one that accepted members from all five tribes who were originally one tribe, but due to colonization, it had been split up into the five groups known today. The Amerisee wished to reunite the five tribes. The attempt ultimately failed and the Amerisee tribal members, were reabsorbed into their tribes of origin. John Matthew (Mathieu, Mathew and Matthews—alternative spellings for the same family), who is listed on the 1900 Census in Monticello Maine along with his family, writes that he is “Amerisee” however under “Tribe of Father of this Indian” and “Tribe of Mother of this Indian” he says they were both “mi’kmaw” which is the Mi’kmaq word for “Mi’kmaq”. His children were listed as Frank, Lizzie and Annie (Anastasia) Matthew. His parents were Frank and Bertha Matthew(s). He was also a basket maker. According to his death record, he was born in “Restigouche Ind.” territory, which is a testament to how far they would travel to reach farmland in places such as Monticello. John Matthew and other families like his, make up an interesting Native American element to Monticello&#x27;s migrant seasonal and farm work history.

<text>New Sweden is a town in Aroostook County, Maine, United States. The population was 577 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Starting in 1870, a Swedish-immigrant colony was established by the State of Maine in Aroostook County. The State of Maine had appointed William W. Thomas, Jr., who had served as American Consul in Sweden during the administration of President Abraham Lincoln, to be State Immigration Commissioner. On March 23, 1870, the Legislature passed an Act authorizing a Board of Immigration and Thomas was named Commissioner of Immigration. Thomas went to Sweden, recruited the first 51 immigrants, and led them into the township that became New Sweden. Early hardships were overcome and the colony prospered and grew into the neighboring townships of Westmanland (1879), Stockholm (1881) and the surrounding areas.
New Sweden has maintained many Swedish traditions since its founding, including the celebrations of St. Lucia Day and &quot;Midsommar.&quot; Founders Day is also observed on July 23 every year. The Swedish language can sometimes still be heard in the older generation. The New Sweden Folk Dancers typically perform at many of the Swedish celebrations and Swedish foods are known to grace the tables.

New Sweden was the home of Einar Gustafson, who was the archetype of the child for whom the Jimmy Fund was named. The Disappearance of Stefanie Damron occurred here in September 2024.

==Historic buildings and sites==

Sites and buildings located in New Sweden which are eligible for the National Register of Historic Places include the Gustaf Adolph Lutheran Church was organized August 1871.
Gustaf Adolph Lutheran Church [along with Faith, Caribou and Trinity (formerly Oscar Frederick) Lutheran churches]was served by a native Swedish pastor as recently as 1979–1985 when The Rev. Hans Olof Andræ accepted a call to the three-point parish. Pastor Andræ occasionally conducted services in Swedish and his daughter, Rebecka Vanja Andræ, taught conversational Swedish classes 1983–1985.

==2003 poisoning==
The town made national news headlines in 2003 when a man poisoned the coffee urn at the local Lutheran church, sickening 15 parishioners and killing one. On April 27, 2003, 78-year-old Walter Reid Morrill, known to the town by his middle name, died of arsenic poisoning after drinking coffee at the Gustaf Adolph Lutheran Church in New Sweden, and 15 other, mostly elderly churchgoers became ill, three of them seriously. Five days later, church member Daniel Bondeson, 53, was found after apparently shooting himself in the lower-chest with a rifle, and left a suicide note in which he confessed to committing with the poisoning stating that it was caused by a dispute that the church did not use an altar-table he donated weeks before the poisoning. The note also stated that he intended to sicken the parishioners rather than kill them, but the first death from a poisoning to a friend of his drove him to suicide. The note has never been released to the public. The arsenic was later discovered to have been sourced from Bondeson&#x27;s farm where it was used as a herbicide. Another victim would die years later due to complications from the poisoning.

The crime was chronicled in Christine Young&#x27;s 2005 true crime book &quot;A Bitter Brew: Faith, Power, and Poison in a Small New England Town&quot; and on the show, &quot;Mystery ER&quot;, which aired an episode on this incident from the point of view of the youngest victim, then 30 years old.

<text>Presque Isle ( ) is the commercial center and largest city in Aroostook County, Maine, United States. The population was 8,797 at the 2020 Census. The city is home to the University of Maine at Presque Isle, Northern Maine Community College, Northern Maine Fairgrounds, the Aroostook Centre Mall, and the Presque Isle International Airport.

Presque Isle is the headquarters of the Aroostook Band of Micmac, a federally recognized tribe.

==History==

The first European settlers were British Loyalists who reached the area in 1819 hoping to obtain land for lumber. Border disputes between the United States and the United Kingdom over the area, however, made it impossible for pioneers to gain title to the land. In response, the government of the neighboring British colony of New Brunswick (now a Canadian province) gave out patents for pioneers to live on the land but not claim ownership or sell it. By 1825, surveyors traveling along the Aroostook River noted that twenty families lived along it and noted that while agriculture was present, all of the families employed most of their time towards wood production.

The boundary dispute slowed development in the area, but the government of Massachusetts, which governed the territory at the time, saw the territory as theirs and encouraged the development of settlements in northern Maine by offering land grants and mill privileges in the 1820s. The first American to settle in the area was Dennis Fairbanks in 1828 who gained ownership over the land under the provisions set up by Massachusetts and later Maine, which gained statehood in 1820.

=== Name and incorporation ===
Originally known as Fairbanks for its founder Dennis Fairbanks, Presque Isle was settled in 1828 on land that was unknown to be part of British North America (Canada) or the United States. The Aroostook War broke out in 1838 because of boundary disputes between the two countries, which were resolved in 1842 by the Webster-Ashburton Treaty. The township was incorporated from Plantations F, G and H on April 4, 1859, as Presque Isle, derived from the French term for peninsula (&quot;presqu&#x27;île&quot;), as the courses of the Aroostook River and Presque Isle Stream form a peninsula. In 1864, Fairmount Cemetery was established in the south of Presque Isle to accommodate Union soldiers returning from the Civil War. In 1883, the town of Maysville was annexed.

On January 1, 1940, Presque Isle was incorporated as a city.

=== Industry, agriculture and transportation ===

====Lumbering and early industries====
The first industry to form in Presque Isle was the lumber industry. By the 1880s, industry included two lumbermills, a gristmill, a wool carding mill, a furniture factory, a carriage factory and a tinware factory.

====Agriculture====
During the last 30 years of the 19th century, agriculture became important, and the entire county became noted for its production of potatoes. On October 9, 1851, the first Northern Maine Fair exhibition opened. A starch factory was opened in 1874, providing a ready market for local potatoes. In 1914 the Aroostook Farm was purchased as a Maine Agricultural Experiment Station.

====Railroad====
In 1881, the New Brunswick Railway created the first rail connection in Presque Isle. The Bangor and Aroostook Railroad arrived in 1895.

====Airport====
A small airport was established in 1931. It was expanded within the decade and later assumed major military importance. The Presque Isle Air Force Base, in operation between 1941 and 1961, was a major departure point for U.S. fighter planes during World War II and the Korean War due to its relative proximity to Europe. When the base was sold, a piece of it became the Northern Maine Regional Airport. In June 2018, the Northern Maine Regional Airport was renamed Presque Isle International Airport.

Beginning on July 2, 2018, United Airlines began service from the Presque Isle International Airport in Presque Isle, Maine to Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey. These flights are federally subsidized through the Essential Air Service (EAS) program, and are operated by United Express carrier, GoJet Airlines.

On 4 June 2024, the US Dept. of Transportation awarded Jet Blue its first ever essential air service contract to replace United Airlines at Presque Isle. The service will be less frequent, but offer more capacity to Boston Logan, than the previous service offered to Newark Liberty International.

=== Colleges and universities ===

In 1903, the Aroostook State Normal School began offering a two-year teacher preparation program. In 1968, it was renamed the University of Maine at Presque Isle. Northern Maine Technical College was established in 1961, now Northern Maine Community College. The first students entered the college in 1963. Today it serves about 2000 students.

=== Hospitals ===
The first Presque Isle Hospital was established on April 8, 1912. Four physicians were affiliated with the hospital, whose dual aims were to serve the community and to provide a training school for nurses. The building was a white-frame structure, enlarged from a home under construction. The need and demand for the hospital increased so rapidly that in 1921 a new three-story brick hospital was dedicated. This hospital was in operation for nearly four decades, when it, too, proved inadequate. A major fundraising campaign was launched in the late 1950s. After a large donation was given by Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Wildes, the daughter of the late Senator Arthur Gould, the Arthur R. Gould Memorial Hospital was constructed and opened in 1960. The hospital has expanded and been modernized in recent years, and in 1981 became part of The Aroostook Medical Center.

=== The Double Eagle II ===
On August 11, 1978, the &quot;Double Eagle II&quot; was launched from a Presque Isle field carrying three passengers. It made the first successful transatlantic balloon crossing. In honor of the &quot;Double Eagle II&quot;, the city holds an annual celebration called The Crown of Maine Balloon Festival. The popular event includes balloon rides, plane tours, amateur photo contests and children&#x27;s fair rides. Sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce and other local organizations, it is held in late August. The field from which the &quot;Double Eagle II&quot; lifted off now features a commemorative model balloon.

=== All American City ===
Presque Isle was named an All American City in 1966.

== Amish community ==

There is an Amish community in Smyrna, that began as one of the &quot;Christian Communities&quot; of Elmo Stoll in 1996. From the beginning most members had an Amish background, but some came from other plain communities while others had no plain background. Soon after the early death of Elmo Stoll in 1998, the &quot;Christian Communities&quot; began to disband. The community in Smyrna lost most of his members, who had no plain background, and then decided to seek fellowship with the Michigan Amish Churches of the Old Order Amish. The Amish in Smyrna are said to be more open to outsiders than other Amish communities. They hold most of their church services in English. They are in fellowship with the Maine Amish in Unity and Hodgdon. Contrary to most other Amish, the Amish men in Smyrna wear moustaches along with long beards, which reflects their &quot;Christian Communities&quot; history. In 2005, the Amish community consisted of approximately 100 people.

<text>Baldwin is a town in Cumberland County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,520 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine, metropolitan statistical area.

==History==

First called Flintstown Plantation, it was granted in 1774 by the Massachusetts General Court to survivors of the Concord, Massachusetts, company commanded by Captain John Flint. It replaced a grant of about 1735 which gave them Township No. 3, because when state borders were adjusted in 1741, the town turned out to be in New Hampshire—present-day Walpole. On June 23, 1802, Flintstown was incorporated as Baldwin, named for Colonel Loammi Baldwin, for whom the Baldwin apple was named. Sebago was set off and incorporated in 1826.

The surface of the town is broken, but with soil favorable to grain and hay. Baldwin would be noted for its orchards, and a factory was established in East Baldwin for drying apples. There was also a corn factory. Brooks provided water power for various mills which produced board lumber, barrel staves and shooks. During times of drought, the Saco Water Power Company could regulate water at Great Falls to run mills down the Saco River in Saco and in Biddeford. The Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad followed the Saco River valley for the length of Baldwin.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Baldwin is drained by Breakneck Brook and the Saco River.

The town is crossed by state routes 5, 107, 113 and 117, and is bordered by Sebago on the north; Standish on the east; Hiram on the west; and Cornish and Limington on the south.

<text>Cape Elizabeth is a town in Cumberland County, Maine, United States. The town is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine, metropolitan statistical area. As of the 2020 census, Cape Elizabeth had a population of 9,535.

One of the wealthiest towns in the state, Cape Elizabeth is the location of Portland Head Light, which is the oldest lighthouse in Maine. Since 1999, it has hosted the Beach to Beacon 10K road race which starts at Crescent Beach State Park and ends at Portland Head Light. 

Cape Elizabeth has a single community school department. The Cape Elizabeth High School&#x27;s team name is the &quot;Capers&quot;.

==History==

First explorations by the Kingdom of Spain set a map with the location of Cape Elizabeth, naming it &quot;Cabo de Arrecife&quot; in 1525. 
English explorer Bartholomew Gosnold arrived at Cape Elizabeth in May 1602, during his explorations of what would later be called New England. At the southern tip of the promontory, Richmond Island was visited around 1605 by French explorer Samuel de Champlain and was the site of a trading post in 1628. John Smith explored and mapped New England in 1615, and gave names to places mainly based on the names used by Native Americans. When Smith presented his map to King Charles I, he suggested that the king should feel free to change any of the Indian names to English ones. The king made many such changes, but only four survive today, one of which is Cape Elizabeth, which Charles named in honor of his sister, Elizabeth of Bohemia.

The first habitation by Europeans was on Richmond Island. Without title, Walter Bagnall (called &quot;Great Walt&quot;) in 1628 established a trading post, dealing in rum and beaver skins. &quot;His principal purpose appears to have been to drive a profitable trade with the Indians,&quot; writes historian George J. Varney, &quot;without scruple about his methods.&quot; His cheating caught up with him in October 1631, when he was killed by the Indians, who also burned down his trading post.

Two months later, the Plymouth Company granted Richmond Island to Robert Trelawney and Moses Goodyear, merchants of Plymouth, England, who made it a center for fisheries and trade. By 1638, Trelawney employed 60 men in the fisheries. The first settlers on the mainland were George Cleeve and Richard Tucker, who settled in 1630 on the shore opposite the island, near the Spurwink River. They worked at planting, fishing and trading. Two years later they were driven off by John Winter, Trelawny&#x27;s agent. In 1636, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, lord proprietor of Maine, gave Cleeve and Tucker a grant of including the neck of land called Machegonne—now Portland. In 1643 English Parliamentarian Alexander Rigby bought the large existing Plough of Lygonia patent, which included Cape Elizabeth.
The Cape Elizabeth settlement on the Fore River was known as Purpoodock. It was attacked during King Philip&#x27;s War in 1675. During King William&#x27;s War, in Major Benjamin Church&#x27;s second expedition a year later on September 11, 1690, he arrived with 300 men at Casco Bay. He went up the Androscoggin River to Fort Pejepscot (present-day Brunswick, Maine). From there he went upriver and attacked a native village. Three or four native men were shot while retreating; Church discovered five captive New Englanders in the wigwams; six or seven prisoners were summarily killed as an example; and nine prisoners were taken. A few days later, in retaliation, the natives attacked Church at Cape Elizabeth on Purpooduc Point, killing seven of his men and wounding 24 others. On September 26, Church returned to Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

In 1703, during Queen Anne&#x27;s War, the town was destroyed. It was resettled about 1719 or 1720.

Cape Elizabeth became Maine&#x27;s 23rd town on November 1, 1765, when it separated from Falmouth, as Portland was then known. Its first town meeting was held on December 2, 1765. South Portland separated in 1895 from Cape Elizabeth, which contains a number of houses designed by John Calvin Stevens.

In 1872, construction of a US Army coast artillery fort began around Portland Head Light, which in 1899 was named Fort Williams, after Major General Seth Williams of the Civil War. The fort was to guard the southern entrance to Portland Harbor. Active between 1899 and 1962, the fort was then purchased by the town for about $200,000. Today, Fort Williams Park includes Portland Head Light and museum, some remains of the military fort, the ruins of Goddard Mansion, tennis courts, a baseball diamond and grandstand, and other recreation facilities. The park is maintained by the town and has a pay display parking system to assist with park repairs.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The nearest city is South Portland. Cape Elizabeth shares a border with South Portland to the north and Scarborough to the west.

The town includes two islands. Ram Island is a small and unoccupied island southwest of Richmond Island. This should not be confused with Ram Island Ledge which contains Ram Island Ledge Light and is within Portland, Maine. The Richmond Island, originally inhabited by Native Americans, then English settlers, is now uninhabited except by a small herd of sheep.

Cape Elizabeth is the home of three coastal parks: Fort Williams Park, Two Lights State Park, and Crescent Beach State Park. Additionally, the Cape Elizabeth Land Trust, a private nonprofit corporation, protects of land on 22 different parcels for public use, maintaining a large system of connecting non-motorized trails on most.

The town itself has 923 acres of land owned or under easement protection for conservation purposes.

==History==

On January 30, 1767, Raymondtown Plantation was granted by the Massachusetts General Court to Capt. William Raymond of Beverly, Massachusetts, and his company of soldiers for their service with Sir William Phipps in the 1690 Battle of Quebec. It replaced a 1735 grant called Beverly-Canada (now Weare, New Hampshire) which was ruled invalid in 1741 because of a prior claim by the heirs of John Mason. In 1803, Raymondtown Plantation was incorporated as Raymond. The town of Naples was created with land taken in 1838, the same year the western half of Raymond petitioned the legislature to be set off as a township because of its geographical separation behind Rattlesnake Mountain. The petition failed, but three years later another was accepted. On March 18, 1841, Casco was incorporated as a town.

Farmers found the surface of the town uneven, its hard and rocky soil &quot;tolerably productive.&quot; Outlets of ponds, however, provided Casco with good sites for water powered mills. The town had four sawmills, four gristmills, a shook mill, a barrel stave mill, four shingle factories, a carriage factory and a tannery. In 1832, the Cumberland and Oxford Canal made Sebago Lake a direct trade route to Portland. Steamboat travel commenced on the waterways in the 1840s, carrying tourists and freight.
In 1938, Sebago Lake State Park was established, one of the state&#x27;s five original state parks.

Cumberland, Maine (also known as Cumberland Center), became independent in March 1821 after it split from North Yarmouth. The town was officially named by Ephraim Sturdivant when the new town government elected him to do the task.

The Cumberland Fair, an annual agricultural fair, has been held yearly in Cumberland during the month of September since 1868. This Portland suburb has a rich farming history, but only a small number of working farms remain, such as Sweetser&#x27;s Apple Barrel &amp; Orchards, Spring Brook Farms, and Double T Orchards. Chebeague Island, long a part of Cumberland, formed its own town in 2007. Since 1960, Cumberland&#x27;s motto has been &quot;Where what comes around keeps going around!&quot;

<doc id="115935" wikidata="Q2323206" url="?curid=115935" title="Falmouth, Maine">
<text>Falmouth ( ) is a town in Cumberland County, Maine, United States. The population was 12,444 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Portland-South Portland-Biddeford metropolitan area.

A northern suburb of Portland, Falmouth borders Casco Bay and offers one of the largest anchorages in Maine. The town is home to three private golf clubs and the Portland Yacht Club.

==History==
=== Native Americans ===

Native Americans followed receding glaciers into Maine around 11,000 BCE. At the time of European contact in the sixteenth century, people speaking a western dialect of the Wabanaki language inhabited present-day Falmouth. Captain John Smith observed a semi-autonomous band known as the Aucocisco living in Casco Bay. English explorer Christopher Levett met with the Aucocisco Sagamore Skittery Gusset at his summer village at the Presumpscot Falls in 1623.

A combination of warfare and disease decimated Native peoples in the years before English colonization, creating a shatter zone of devastation and political instability in what would become southern Maine. The introduction of European wares in the 1500s reoriented long-standing Native trade relationships in the Gulf of Maine. Warfare soon broke out among groups such as the Mi&#x27;kmaq and Penobscot who sought to subjugate their neighbors by monopolizing access to European goods. The arrival of foreign pathogens only served to compound the upheaval in the region. A particularly notorious epidemic between 1614 and 1620 ravaged the population of coastal New England with mortality rates at upwards of 90 percent. Native peoples were not totally destroyed however, maintaining a visible presence in the Casco Bay area until King George&#x27;s War in the 1740s. French military defeats and increasing settler migration to the area from the southern New England Colonies impelled most Native Americans to assimilate into British colonial society, migrate toward the protection of New France or further up the coast where they remain today.

=== New Casco (1630–1765) ===

Falmouth&#x27;s original bounds encompassed the present day cities of Portland, South Portland, Westbrook and Cape Elizabeth. Today’s town was known as New Casco, and was only a neighborhood within the larger collection of communities around Casco Bay centered in what is downtown Portland. Falmouth’s early years were marked by extreme violence as it lay on a borderland zone between Europeans and Native Americans. Casco Bay represented the northernmost point of British colonial settlement on the east coast until 1713. Numerous wars between 1675–1763 among the British, French, and Native Americans rarely left Falmouth unscathed from the violence. English colonists twice abandoned Casco Bay altogether under pressure from French and Indian attacks in 1676 and 1690.

The first European resident was Arthur Mackworth, who lived on the east bank of the Presumpscot River as early as 1630. When the Massachusetts Bay Colony took political control of Maine in 1658 from the heirs of Sir Ferdinando Gorges, they renamed the area Falmouth after an important Parliamentarian victory in the English Civil War. Colloquially known as &quot;Falmouth in Casco Bay&quot; to distinguish it from Falmouth, Massachusetts on Cape Cod, it was the 7th town in the recently formed Province of Maine, later being formally incorporated on November 12, 1718.

One of the earliest structures in the town of Falmouth was a palisaded fort and trading post named Fort Casco built in 1698 at the conclusion of King William&#x27;s War. The location of the fort can be found today opposite Pine Grove Cemetery on Route 88. Massachusetts built the fort at the behest of local Abenaki desiring a convenient place to trade and repair tools and weapons. A 1701 meeting between the Wabanaki leaders and Massachusetts officials cemented an alliance between the two. A pair of stone cairns were then erected to symbolize the new partnership. The nearby Two Brothers Islands later received their name from this now long-forgotten monument.

Unfortunately, this peace would last less than three years, with the inauguration of Queen Anne&#x27;s War in 1702. Governor Joseph Dudley held a conference at New Casco with representatives of the Abenaki tribes on June 20, 1703, trying to convince them not to ally with the French. His efforts were unsuccessful, as the fort was besieged only two months later by Abenaki Sagamores Moxus, Wanungonet, Assacombuit and their French Allies during the Northeast Coast Campaign. The arrival of the Massachusetts ship &quot;Province Galley&quot; relieved the fort by dispersing the Wabanaki and the some 500 French with its guns. Peace returned in 1713 with the Treaty of Portsmouth. When the resettlement of present-day Portland began in 1716, the Province of Massachusetts ordered that the fort at New Casco be demolished rather than maintain it.

New Casco was not permanently settled by British colonists until the fall of Quebec in 1759 permanently removed the threat of French and Indian attacks. Living so far away from Portland was dangerous: only one family lived in the town in 1725. An Indian raid in 1745 and the murder of Job Burnal in 1751 represented the risks colonists undertook to live in the area. The majority of the first permanent European inhabitants to the town came after 1740, quickly growing to &quot;62 families&quot; and forming their own parish in 1753 (currently the Falmouth Congregational Church). The population of Falmouth would hover between 1,000 and 2,000 residents for the next two centuries. These residents engaged in farming, fishing, and harvesting masts. Mills on the Presumpscot River, Piscataqua River in West Falmouth, and Mussel Cove powered sawmills, processed agricultural products, and manufactured finished goods by the 1800s.

=== Modern Falmouth ===

In 1765 Cape Elizabeth (then including South Portland) seceded from Falmouth. In 1786, Portland broke away, followed in 1814 by Westbrook, although boundaries between it and Falmouth were readjusted throughout the nineteenth century. Logistics were the reason these separations. Population had grown by the 1760s to the extent that separate church parishes had formed, creating rival communities more attuned to local concerns. People also complained about the distance between outer areas and the center of the town in present-day Portland. By 1859, fishing and farming were principal trades. Other industries included three shipbuilders, three brickmakers, a sawmill, gristmill and tannery. In 1886, the town also produced boots, shoes, tinware and carriage stock.
The extension of trolley service from Portland to the Falmouth Foreside in 1898 initiated the town&#x27;s transformation from a rural community to an urban consumer society. Trolleys cemented Falmouth’s economic connection to Portland and transformed the Foreside neighborhood into a relaxation spot for nearby city dwellers. Portland’s Yankee elites relocated the Portland Yacht Club and Portland Country Club to Falmouth in 1885 and 1913 respectively, where they have remained ever since. To promote its line, the Portland and Yarmouth Electric Railway Company opened Underwood Spring Park north of Town Landing in 1899. The park’s attractions included a casino, hotel, and outdoor theater. Fire destroyed Underwood Spring Park in 1907 and was not rebuilt. The Portland–Lewiston Interurban also ran up today’s Route 100 in West Falmouth. People’s growing preference for the automobile spelled the end for trolleys, which ended service in 1933.

In 1943, Percival Proctor Baxter donated Mackworth Island to the state as a wildlife refuge; today it is site of the state school for the deaf and hard of hearing.

The advent of the automobile accelerated Falmouth&#x27;s transition toward becoming a residential suburb of Portland. Military personnel who moved to the town while Casco Bay was base Sail for America’s destroyer fleet from 1941 to 1944 bolstered much of this growth. Like many urban areas in the United States during the mid-twentieth century, the automobile, cheaper residential taxes, and the desire for open space channeled an urban exodus away from cities like Portland into neighboring towns such as Falmouth. In the span of fifty years the town’s population has skyrocketed from five thousand to over ten thousand residents today. Falmouth’s location on the ocean, along with its respected public school system, has made it one of the more attractive communities in Greater Portland. This demand consequently led developers to construct two additional country clubs in 1986 and 1988. The nature of such enclosed neighborhoods and other high-scale subdivisions like it has only recently turned the town into one of the most affluent in Maine.

<text>Frye Island is an island town in Cumberland County, Maine, United States. Located in Sebago Lake, the island is accessed via a public car ferry from Raymond Neck, or by private boat. All residents of the resort town are seasonal. The majority of property owners hail from New England area states (Maine, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont and New Hampshire) however there are many other states also represented on the island. Frye Island is vacant from November through April, and the ferry does not operate during that time due to thick ice blocking its route during the winter. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine Metropolitan Statistical Area. The town had a population of 32 at the 2020 census.

==History==
It was included in the 1750 grant made by the Massachusetts General Court to Captain Moses Pearson, Captain Humphrey Hobbs and their respective companies of soldiers for services during the French and Indian Wars. Pearsontown Plantation was first settled in the 1750s, then incorporated as the town of Standish on November 30, 1785. Frye Island, named for Captain Joseph Frye, seceded to become a separate town on July 1, 1998.

A popular legend on Frye Island tells of Captain Frye and his escape from a tribe of Native Americans in Portland. While being chased, Captain Frye came upon a large rock, now known as Frye&#x27;s Leap, and had no way of going around it. Captain Frye made the decision to jump and swim across the channel to Frye Island. Long afterwards, Frye&#x27;s Leap became a popular spot for people to recreate the famous jump. At one point, the sharp and dangerous cliffs became so popular for jumping that numerous, often serious injuries were being reported each summer. And in 2012, a man even died while attempting to dive off the rockface. This in turn caused local law enforcement and the leap&#x27;s landowners to take action, and multiple No Trespassing signs were placed along the cliff edge. On hot summer days, the area is often patrolled by the Maine Warden Service, in order to ward off potential jumpers.

Frye Island is composed of approximately 1,000 mostly wooded acres interlaced with of dirt roads. The speed limit is and the most popular way of transportation on the island is by golf cart rather than car. Many of the homes are built on waterfront property overlooking Sebago Lake. Real estate on Frye Island has skyrocketed over the past decade or so, and many of the waterfront homes assess at extremely high values. On the island, there are two marinas, various athletic and recreational facilities, several public beaches, a convenience store, an ice cream stand, a restaurant with a bar, and a golf club with a lounge that is open to the public.

The island is accessed by twin single-deck car ferries that are owned and operated by the town. They run every half-hour from early in the morning until late in the evening during July and August, reduced somewhat in off-season. The trip takes about 7 minutes. Walk-on passengers are permitted, but there is no passenger parking at the ferry landings.

==Traditions==
Independence Day is the most celebrated holiday on the island, signified by its well known golf cart parade and fireworks display. People from all around Sebago gather to view the fireworks, either by boat or from the beach. Each year a walk and run is held among many other festivities as well.

==Geography==
Frye Island is approximately wide (at the widest point) and long. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Frye Island is situated in Sebago Lake.

<text>Gray is a town in Cumberland County, Maine, United States. The population was 8,269 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area. and included in the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine metropolitan New England city and town area. Gray is located at the intersection of state Routes 4, 26, 100, 115, 202 and the Maine Turnpike exit 63 midway between the state&#x27;s two largest cities, Portland and Lewiston. The town includes frontage on Little Sebago Lake, Crystal Lake, and Forest Lake.

Gray is home to regional headquarters for the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, which maintains a fish hatchery and wildlife park. It is also home to the Gray/Portland Weather Forecast Office of the NOAA&#x27;s National Weather Service, which issues forecasts and weather warnings for New Hampshire and western Maine.

==History==
The area was granted on March 27, 1736, by the Massachusetts General Court to a group from Boston. In 1737, the township was laid out and roads cleared, with the first settlers arriving in the spring of 1738. But during the ongoing French and Indian Wars, the settlement was attacked in the spring of 1745 by Indians, who killed cattle and burned the meetinghouse and all dwellings. Inhabitants fled to other towns. In 1751, the village was resettled, but wiped out again in May 1755.

Consequently, Fort Gray was built in 1755. It featured a blockhouse measuring long by wide, set within a garrison palisade long by wide. The town had been without a name until about 1756, when it began to be called, Boston, then New Boston and eventually, New Town. On June 19, 1778, New Boston Plantation would be incorporated as Gray after Thomas Gray, a proprietor.

Gray had many farms and some quarries. Other industries included a gristmill, 12 sawmills, a tannery, granite and marble works, carriage and sleigh manufacturer, and shuttle maker. Along Collyer Brook, Samuel Mayall established in 1791 the first successful water-powered woolen mill in North America. British woolen guilds had prohibited the production of goods in the colonies and tried to prevent British technology from being put to use in competition against them. Mayall smuggled out of England plans for machinery hidden in bales of cloth meant for trade with the Indians. When the guilds learned of his deception, they tried at least twice to kill him. They sent him a hat in which were hidden pins laced with poison, and then a box with loaded pistols rigged to fire when opened. Suspicious of the packages, Mayall avoided an untimely death. His daughters Mary and Phanela took over the mills when he died in 1831, and built the Lower Mill in 1834. The Mayalls retained ownership until about 1879. The business closed in 1902. The ruins of the mill and associated structures are still visible to this day and are open to the public.

In the 1970s, Gray was chosen as the site of one of ten Decision Information Distribution System radio stations, designed to alert the public of an enemy attack. The system was never implemented and the station was not built.

===&quot;The Stranger&quot;===
 During the Civil War, a Confederate soldier&#x27;s body was accidentally sent to Gray. Instead of sending the body away, the &quot;Ladies of Gray&quot; gave the rebel soldier a proper burial and funded a gravestone marked simply, &quot;Stranger&quot;. A statue dedicated to the &quot;Unknown Soldier&quot; was later erected in Gray Village Center, and every Memorial Day, the Unknown Soldier is respected with a Confederate flag marking the grave. (The Civil War was especially painful for the small town, as they had proportionately sent more men to conflict than any other town in Maine.) Today, there are more than 178 Union soldiers—and one Confederate—buried in the Gray Village Cemetery.
==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Gray, which includes most of Little Sebago Lake and Crystal Lake, is drained by Collyer Brook. Little Sebago Lake has been experiencing problems with milfoil for years.

Gray has five towns surrounding it: Windham to the southwest, Cumberland to the southeast, North Yarmouth to the northeast, New Gloucester to the north-northeast and Raymond to the northwest and west. On a north-up map, Gray is the shape of a crooked square.

Gray has long been interconnected with its neighbor to the north, New Gloucester, both sharing similar demographics, culture and economy. Both towns share the same school district, Maine School Administrative District 15. Being in the vicinity these towns are in, there has been ever-increasing suburban development since the early nineties. Subdivisions and commercial developments have been built at an ever-increasing frequency, leading to the possibility of Gray being swallowed up into the surrounding urban and sub-urban areas in the future. These developments have drawn much protest from residents, many of whom live on the same property as their ancestors many generations ago.

<text>Harpswell is a town in Cumberland County, Maine, United States, within Casco Bay in the Gulf of Maine. The population was 5,031 at the 2020 census. Harpswell is composed of land contiguous with the rest of Cumberland County, called Harpswell Neck, as well as three large islands connected by bridges: Sebascodegan Island (locally known as Great Island), Orr&#x27;s Island, and Bailey Island and over 200 smaller islands. Harpswell is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The Native Americans who originally inhabited Harpswell were Abenaki. The Abenaki name for Harpswell Neck, then called West Harpswell, was &quot;Merriconeag&quot; or &quot;quick carrying place&quot;, a reference to the narrow peninsula&#x27;s easy portage. The Abenaki name for Great Island was Erascohegan or Sebascodiggin, which became by the late 1800s Sebascodegan Island. About 1659 Major Nicholas Shapleigh of Kittery, Maine, bought Merriconeag and Sebascodegan Island from the Abenaki, but because of Indian defense, attempts to settle the area were abandoned until after Dummer&#x27;s War. The Treaty of 1725 brought a truce, and by 1731 many settlers had returned.

Formerly a part of North Yarmouth, in 1758 the town was incorporated by the Massachusetts General Court and named for Harpswell in Lincolnshire, England. Industries included farming and some shipbuilding, but fishing brought considerable profit, and lobstering still contributes to the local economy. The Bailey Island Bridge is a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.

<text>Harrison is a town in Cumberland County, Maine, United States. Harrison is included in the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine metropolitan New England city and town area. The population was 2,447 at the 2020 census. A historic resort area, Harrison straddles Long Lake and Crystal Lake. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area.

==History==

The Massachusetts General Court granted Otis Field Plantation in 1771 to James Otis and other heirs of Captain John Gorham and his company for their service in the 1690 Battle of Quebec. It replaced a 1736 grant which had been ruled invalid. In 1797, the plantation was incorporated as Otisfield. On March 8, 1805, Harrison was set off and incorporated from portions of Otisfield and Bridgton. It was named after a principal landowner, Harrison Gray Otis of Boston, the heir of James Otis.

In the autumn of 1792, two brothers from Gorham, John and Nathan Carsley, built a camp and cleared land in Harrison. During the winter they returned to Gorham, coming back in March 1793 with their wives. Because John Carsley and his wife remained in Harrison when Nathan Carsley and his wife resumed living in Gorham until 1796, he is considered the town&#x27;s first permanent settler. More pioneers arrived, living in log houses chinked with moss. The outlet of Crystal Lake into Long Lake provided water power for industry, and James Sampson erected at Harrison village the first sawmill and gristmill. Over the years other industries followed, including a wire-making business, blacksmithy, shingle mill, harness-maker, foundry, carriage maker, clothing maker and shoe shop. Scribner&#x27;s Mill (now a museum) was built in 1847 on the Crooked River. On the Bear River, in 1867 the Harrison Water Power Company established the Bear River Woolen Mill, destroyed by fire in 1872.

In 1832, the Cumberland and Oxford Canal opened, connecting Portland with Sebago Lake. A series of 27 locks lifted vessels from sea level at Casco Bay to Sebago Lake, above sea level. From there they traveled up the Songo River to Brandy Pond, then continued along the Chute River to Long Lake. As the company name indicates, the canal was originally planned to reach Oxford County, but instead terminated at Harrison. The town became a center for trade and transportation, with wharves and warehouses lining the shore.
In 1847, the Sebago &amp; Long Pond Steam Navigation Company built &quot;Fawn&quot;, the first steamboat to ply the lakes and waterways. It had a shallow draft to navigate the winding Songo River, with passengers asked to shift sides as ballast to keep both paddlewheels in the water around sharp curves. The lakes became a popular summer tourist destination, with The Elm House (later called The Elms Inn) opening in 1860. When the Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad commenced service to Sebago Lake Station in 1870, the canal was abandoned as obsolete. Beginning in 1898, the Bridgton and Saco River Railroad, a narrow gauge line, delivered freight and passengers directly to Harrison.

In 1906, the Harrison Hotel opened. Camp Kineo operated beside Long Lake as a camp for boys. Today, Harrison remains a recreational area. Harrison is also home to Fernwood Cove, a half-season summer camp for girls on the same spot as Camp Chickawah was. It is located on Island Pond.

In 1936 the Historic Deertrees Theatre was built by Enrica Clay Dillon and is still home to countless theatre, opera and music performances, including the Sebago Long Lake Music Festival.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Harrison is drained by the Bear River and Crooked River.

The Maine state routes that cross through Harrison are 35 and 117. Harrison is bordered by the town of Bridgton to its west, Waterford and Norway to its north, Otisfield to its east, and Naples to its south.

===Crystal Lake===
Crystal Lake (formerly &quot;Anonymous Pond&quot;) is north of Long Lake, and overflows into Long Lake through downtown Harrison. Smallmouth bass thrive in the lake, with a few lake trout.

== History ==

Long Island, like other Casco Bay islands, was originally inhabited in the warm months by Native Americans until European settlers first arrived in the 17th century. Col. Ezekiel Cushing purchased the island in 1732 and is credited with being the first European to settle and build a house on the island. He died in 1765, and willed the island to his nine surviving children. Soon after, other settlers arrived to make a livelihood out of farming, fishing, and catching lobsters.

During World War II, Casco Bay became United States Navy base &quot;Sail&quot; for destroyers escorting HX, SC, and ON convoys of the Battle of the Atlantic. Facilities constructed on the island included the Torpedo Control Officers School of the Portland Naval Training Center, a navy supply pier with a naval fuel annex often cited as a source of contamination for both the island&#x27;s marsh and Casco Bay, and the Naval Auxiliary Air Facility Casco Bay seaplane base operated as part of Naval Air Station Brunswick from 14 May 1943 to 15 December 1946. The United States Army Coast Artillery Corps built two batteries of 90 mm dual-purpose guns on the island as the Long Island Military Reservation, part of the Harbor Defenses of Portland.

After the war, tourism became the most popular industry, and several small stores, a fire station, and a K–5 school (1953) were built. In the summer, several hundred or even thousands of tourists travel from places such as Massachusetts and New York to vacation in their summer cottages.

The island was originally part of the city of Portland, which re-evaluated property taxes in 1990. Due in part to high real estate prices paid by out-of-state residents and property aesthetic values, property taxes increased substantially. Many residents felt this move created an unfair discrepancy between the money paid to the City of Portland and the services they received in return. The island voted to secede from Portland, and on July 1, 1993, the island was declared the Town of Long Island. The Long Island Historical Society now houses every news article that was printed about the secession movement as well as video and film footage of the secession ceremonies. These archives also include copies of the local and national news coverage given to the community during its &quot;rebellion&quot;.

<text>Naples is a town in Cumberland County, Maine, United States. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area. The population was 3,925 at the 2020 census, and it is home to part of Sebago Lake State Park. Naples is a resort area.

==History==

The area was settled in 1774. Farming was limited by the soil, which consisted of gravelly loam, its surface strewn with glacial erratic boulders. The uplands, however, provided good grazing for livestock, and hay became the principal crop.

Named for Naples, Italy, the town was incorporated on March 4, 1834, from parts of Otisfield, Harrison, Raymond and Bridgton. Between 1845 and 1856, it annexed more land from Sebago, Otisfield and Bridgton. The Songo Lock, completed two years before town incorporation, linked Long Lake and Brandy Pond with Sebago Lake, allowing passage of boats from Harrison to Portland through the Cumberland and Oxford Canal in Standish. A canning factory and cooperage were established at Naples village. The community also produced carriages, men&#x27;s and boy&#x27;s clothing, boots and shoes.

The scenery of the lakes, however, would make tourism the dominant industry. Visitors in the 19th century included Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and Nathaniel Hawthorne. To accommodate his passengers, Charles L. Goodridge of the Sebago Lake, Songo River &amp; Bay of Naples Steamship Company built a hostelry on a knoll at the southern end of Long Lake. On July 26, 1899, the Bay of Naples Inn opened with 80 bedrooms. It was designed by John Calvin Stevens, who reduced by two-fifths a plan originally created for the ill-fated Metallak Hotel in Colebrook, New Hampshire. While under construction, the Metallak was destroyed in April 1893 during a violent windstorm, and its investors abandoned the project. The Bay of Naples Inn, which faced Mount Washington and the east side of the White Mountains, was a popular resort during the early 20th century. Automobile tourists began arriving after designation of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway in 1919 (identified as United States Route 302 since 1935). The Bay of Naples Inn remained open through the 1951 season, but in 1964 was deemed unprofitable and razed.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Naples is drained by the Songo River.

Water bodies that are adjacent to, or within Naples include:

<text>New Gloucester is a town in Cumberland County, Maine, United States. New Gloucester is included in the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine metropolitan New England city and town area. It is home to the Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village, the last active Shaker village in the U.S. The town&#x27;s population was 5,676 at the 2020 census.

New Gloucester is part of Maine&#x27;s Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, metropolitan statistical area.

==History==

New Gloucester was established in 1736 under a Massachusetts Bay Colony grant of a tract of land in the Maine Territory to sixty inhabitants of the Gloucester fishing village on Cape Ann. The first settlers followed the road newly bushed out from North Yarmouth and built cabins on Harris Hill between 1739 and 1742. The settlement was abandoned from 1744–1751 due to the heightened native tribe attacks during King George&#x27;s War.

Settlers returned and in 1753 commenced work on a two-story, fifty-foot square blockhouse with a palisade stockade on a side. This was home to twelve families for six years. The men worked at clearing the surrounding of common land under the protection of two swivel guns manned by a garrison of six soldiers. One attack was made upon the fort, resulting in one scalping and two men captured. As the Native Americans gradually withdrew to Canada, the settlers moved out into their own newly built homes. The blockhouse continued to serve for worship and town affairs until the first meetinghouse was built in 1773. In 1788, the blockhouse was sold at auction for seven bushels of corn and moved to a farm in the Intervale, where it was rebuilt as a hog house.

New Gloucester was incorporated on March 8, 1774, and was named after Gloucester, Massachusetts, the native home of a large share of the early settlers.

New Gloucester became a half shire town with Portland, and the courts met here from 1791 until the organization of Oxford County in 1805, when they returned to Portland. With good soil for agriculture, the town developed as a prosperous farming community.

Yarmouth originally constituted the eastern portion of North Yarmouth; the &quot;North&quot; in the name intended to differentiate it from Yarmouth, Massachusetts, on Cape Cod (Maine then being a part of Massachusetts). North Yarmouth was chartered on September 22, 1680, encompassing the area of the present Town of North Yarmouth and the future towns of Harpswell (until 1750), Freeport (until 1789), Pownal (until 1808, from Freeport), Cumberland (until 1821), and Yarmouth (until 1849).

In 1980, to coincide with the tricentennial celebration of the incorporation of the Town of North Yarmouth, a new printing of the William Hutchinson Rowe original 1937 book &quot;Ancient North Yarmouth and Yarmouth, Maine 1636–1936: A History&quot; was made.

<text>Raymond is a town in Cumberland County, Maine, United States. Raymond is included in the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine metropolitan New England city and town area. The population was 4,536 at the 2020 census. It is a summer recreation area and is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area. Raymond Neck is the landing for the ferry to the town of Frye Island in Sebago Lake. The Raymond school system is currently affiliated with the Windham school system in a district known as RSU 14.

==History==

Raymondtown Plantation was granted in 1767 by the Massachusetts General Court to the descendants of Captain William Raymond of Beverly, Massachusetts, and his militia. It was the second attempt to repay the troop (or heirs) for service under Governor Sir William Phipps during the Battle of Quebec in 1690. A township had been awarded them in 1735 called Beverly-Canada (now Weare, New Hampshire), but in 1741 descendants of John Mason proved a prior claim.

The township at Sebago Lake was given to the Beverly Proprietors as compensation. It was first settled in 1770 by Captain Joseph Dingley and Dominicus Jordan of Cape Elizabeth, although most families arrived after the Revolutionary War. It was on the stage route to Bridgton. On June 21, 1803, the Raymondtown Plantation was incorporated as Raymond, named in honor of Captain Raymond. In 1829, land was annexed to help form the new town of Naples, and in 1841, Casco was set off and incorporated as a town.

The town provided agriculture and lumber products for Portland and other cities. Panther Run, which drains Panther Pond, provided water power for industry. Raymond village grew near the mills, which included a gristmill, sawmill, plaster mill, a stave factory and a children&#x27;s sled factory. From about 1812 until 1825, Nathaniel Hawthorne lived in Raymond with his siblings and widowed mother. His later writings would reminisce about his boyhood hiking in the woods or fishing in the lake.

Automobile tourists discovered Raymond after designation of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway in 1919 (identified as United States Route 302 since 1935).

<text>Sebago is a town in Cumberland County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,911 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area.

==History==

Originally called Flintstown, it was granted in 1774 by the Massachusetts General Court to survivors of Captain John Flint&#x27;s company of soldiers from Concord, Massachusetts. It replaced a grant of 1735 that awarded them Township No. 3 (now Walpole, New Hampshire), but which was ruled invalid when the border between Massachusetts and New Hampshire was redrawn to satisfy prior claims by the descendants of John Mason. On June 23, 1802, Flintstown was incorporated as Baldwin. Then on February 10, 1826, Sebago was set off from Baldwin and incorporated as a separate town. It took the name of Sebago Lake. Land was annexed from Denmark in 1830, and taken in 1834 to help form Naples.

Lumberjacks and woodsmen were the first European inhabitants of the area, but they left as soon as the first growth of pine was cut. It 1790, Joseph Lakin from Groton, Massachusetts, built a cabin, then returned with his family and possessions. The surface of the town is very uneven and generally rocky, so it was hard work to clear a farm for cultivation. But the soil was good and yielded abundant crops. Mills were built at water power sites, and products included long and short lumber, shooks, and boots and shoes. In 1832, the Cumberland and Oxford Canal opened, increasing trade between Sebago Lake and Portland. In the early 1870s, the Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad carried tourists and freight to Sebago Lake Station in Standish, where steamboats took them to various landings around the lake. Inns, hotels and summer camps opened, and the town became a recreation area, which it remains today.

In 1906, the Order of Sir Galahad, an Episcopal youth organization, established Camp O-AT-KA in East Sebago.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Situated beside Sebago Lake, Sebago is drained by the Northwest River and Mill Brook. Douglas Mountain has an elevation of above sea level, the highest point in both the town and southwestern Maine.

The town is crossed by state routes 11, 107 and 114. It is bordered by the towns of Bridgton to the north, Naples to the northeast, Baldwin and Standish to the south, and Denmark and Hiram to the west.

<text>South Portland is a city in Cumberland County, Maine, United States, and is the fourth-most populous city in the state, incorporated in 1898. At the 2020 census, the city population was 26,498. Known for its working waterfront, South Portland is situated on Portland Harbor and overlooks the skyline of Portland and the islands of Casco Bay. Due to South Portland&#x27;s close proximity to air, marine, rail, and highway transportation options, the city has become a center for retail and industry in the region. The Maine Mall, the largest shopping mall in the state, is located in South Portland. It is also a designated Tree City USA community.

Despite the name, South Portland was never part of the city of Portland, but rather part of Cape Elizabeth, separating in 1895. However, both Cape Elizabeth and Portland were once part of Falmouth. Cape Elizabeth, then including what later became South Portland, broke away from Falmouth in 1765. South Portland is a principal city of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford metropolitan area.

==History==
South Portland was first colonized in 1630, and it grew to become a small residential community with many farms. The village was raided by natives in Father Rale&#x27;s War (1724). In 1858, the City of Portland purchased land near the Fore River for the Forest City Cemetery. On March 15, 1895, it was incorporated as a town after it broke away from Cape Elizabeth, based on a disagreement on a future source of public drinking water. Three years later South Portland became a city, destined to receive its drinking water, like Portland, from Sebago Lake, while Cape Elizabeth used wells or other local sources.

On South Portland&#x27;s waterfront is Fort Preble, which is a military fort established in 1808 to protect Portland Harbor. It was in operation during several American conflicts, including the United States Civil War, World War I, and World War II. Near Fort Preble is Spring Point Ledge Light, which was constructed by the federal government in 1897 to mark a dangerous rock ledge.

In December 1844, Portland resident Ellen G. White, who became a founder of the Seventh-day Adventist church, is said to have experienced her first vision during a prayer meeting at the home of Mrs. Haines at 60 Ocean Street, which later became the Griffin Club. The building was torn down in 2018.

In 1940, the Todd-Bath Iron Shipbuilding Corp (later called the &quot;East Yard&quot;) was established to build cargo ships for Britain. When the United States became involved with World War II, the shipyard expanded to include the South Portland Shipbuilding Corp. (aka the “West Yard”), that later combined with the Todd-Bath yard to become the New England Shipbuilding Corporation. These shipyards built 236 of the 440 foot (134 m) long Liberty ships, more than 10 percent of all the Liberty ships constructed during the war years. At its peak, the shipyard employed some 30,000 people, including thousands of women, who took over the jobs vacated by men going into the service. The shipyard gradually ceased operations after the war ended in 1945. Remnants of the shipyards are visible, and there is a memorial to the shipyard and the workers at Bug Light Park. The park is also home to Portland Breakwater Lighthouse, commonly referred to as &quot;Bug Light&quot;.

On July 11, 1944, at 4:45 p.m., U.S. Army Lt. Phillip &quot;Phee&quot; Russell was attempting to land his Douglas A-26 Invader at the Portland-Westbrook Municipal Airport. For reasons that were never fully determined, Russell lost control of the plane and crashed into a trailer park in South Portland&#x27;s Brick Hill neighborhood. Nineteen people were killed and 20 people were injured—mostly the families of South Portland shipyard workers—making it the worst aviation accident in Maine history. A Long Creek Air Tragedy Memorial was eventually erected to commemorate the crash and honor the victims, but not until 66 years later.

Over the last few decades, South Portland has become the retail capital of Maine. The Mill Creek shopping center, built in the 1950s, was the first such &quot;strip mall&quot; built in Maine: a line of stores under one long roof and a covered walkway. Mill Creek has changed and grown significantly since, but the original layout still forms the core of the stores. The area in Mill Creek known as the Waterfront Market sits at the base of the Casco Bay Bridge and attracts shoppers from Scarborough, Cape Elizabeth and Portland.

The need for a large mall in Maine emerged in the 1960s, as Portland&#x27;s downtown district could not accommodate the growing retail market. A former pig farm in South Portland was chosen as the site for the project because it was close to I-95 and convenient from Portland. Beginning construction of the Maine Mall in the late 1960s marked the start of a major transition in the western part of South Portland: from a rural, agrarian landscape to the large retail center that exists today.

The oldest neighborhood in South Portland, and its former &quot;retail corridor&quot;, is Ferry Village. Prior to the Casco Bay Bridge (or the one it replaced, the Million Dollar Bridge), ferries transported people and goods back and forth across the harbor to Portland. The landscape and the makeup of residents in Ferry Village were forever changed upon the close of the WWII shipyards. The Village has slowly bounced back and is now one of the more popular places in the city to live.

Ferry Village also has one of the most active and involved neighborhood associations in Southern Maine. The Ferry Village Neighborhood Conservation Association (FVNCA) was formed in August 1985 to address the development boom in the 1980s which was quickly altering the character of the waterfront and many Greater Portland neighborhoods. FVNCA was instrumental in the formation of the South Portland Land Trust as well as the City-managed Land Bank which provides seed money for the acquisition of available open space.

After decades of neglect, the westernmost neighborhoods of South Portland, including Redbank and Brick Hill, experienced new growth and revitalization in 2006 with the redevelopment of land formerly belonging to Long Creek Youth Development Center as a mixed-use neighborhood featuring affordable housing, market rate housing, professional offices and outdoor recreational spaces. The redevelopment of the Brick Hill site spurred additional private development nearby in the form of market rate housing, retail and light industry. The city&#x27;s 2017 West End Master Plan aims to further encourage such development in that area of the city.

South Portland was voted one of the best places to live in Maine in 2018.

== Government and politics ==
South Portland has a council-manager form of government.

The city council is made up of seven members elected by the citizens: one member from each of the five districts in the city, and two at-large members. Voters are allowed to vote for council candidates in all five districts, not just the district where they are registered to vote.

Every December, the members of the council elect one of themselves as mayor, which is primarily a ceremonial title. The mayor serves as chairman of the council.

The city council is responsible for establishing policy, passing local ordinances, voting appropriations, and developing an overall vision for the city.

The council appoints a city manager to oversee the daily operations of the government and implement the policies established by the council. The manager is an employee of the city and has a contract that specifies his or her duties and responsibilities. Ideally, the manager is considered apolitical.

===Elections===
Voter registration
=== Mayoral controversy ===
In December 2007, then-mayor James Soule made headlines in Maine and across the country when he proposed in his inaugural address that South Portland, along with parts of southern Maine, secede from the state of Maine and form a new state. Soule referred to the state government of Maine as an &quot;oppressive enemy&quot; and said that South Portland, along with other southern Maine cities and towns, contributes much more to the state in tax revenue than it receives in education funding. &quot;The state of Maine needs South Portland more than South Portland needs the state of Maine,&quot; Soule claimed.

Soule&#x27;s proposal was panned by the congressional delegation and by Governor Baldacci, whose spokesman called it &quot;silly&quot; and &quot;counterproductive.&quot;

The proposal did not gain any traction, and Soule did not continue to pursue it. Soule nominated himself for reelection as mayor in November 2008, but was defeated by Thomas Blake in a 6–1 vote. Soule voted for himself.

<text>Standish is a town in Cumberland County, Maine, United States. The population was 10,244 at the 2020 census. It includes the villages of Standish Corner, Sebago Lake Village and Steep Falls, and the localities known as Richville, Elmwood, Standish Neck and Two Trails. Standish is part of the Portland-South Portland-Biddeford metropolitan area.

==History==

This was once hunting and fishing territory of the Abenaki tribe, whose main village was at Pequawket (now Fryeburg) up the Pequawket Trail (now Route 113). In 1750, the Massachusetts General Court granted the township to Captain Moses Pearson and Captain Humphrey Hobbs, together with their respective companies, for services during the French and Indian Wars.

It was to be called Pearson and Hobbs Town, but Hobbs died and none of his company took possession. In 1752, the land was surveyed and divided into lots, although some soldiers sold their rights for whatever they could get. Those that did settle found their cabins razed by Indians trying to drive them away. In response, the veterans built at Standish Corner a stockaded fort, which provided protection until Indian hostilities ceased in 1759 with the Fall of Quebec. Pearsontown Plantation was incorporated as Standish on November 30, 1785. The town is named in honor of Captain Myles Standish.

Much of Standish is sandy plains covered with pine, yet farmers found considerable arable land. Watermills at various streams produced lumber, headings, shooks, barrel staves, carriages, clothing, flour, ice, plaster and packing boxes. The Cumberland and Oxford Canal opened in 1832, increasing trade between Sebago Lake and Portland. It was followed by the Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad, which on September 12, 1870, began regular passenger service between Portland and Sebago Lake Station. Tourists could arrive by train in the morning, ride a side-wheel steamboat the whole length of the lakes, then return to the city by evening. The cost of the excursion in 1876 was $1.75 from Portland to Naples, and $2.00 from Portland to Bridgton, North Bridgton or Harrison. Standish also had railroad depots at Richville and Steep Falls. In 1998, Frye Island in Sebago Lake was set off and incorporated as a separate town. Today, Standish is both a recreational area and suburb of Portland.

Situated beside Sebago Lake, Standish is drained by Sebago Lake and the Presumpscot River, which is the town&#x27;s eastern border, and by the Saco River, which is the town&#x27;s (and Cumberland County&#x27;s) southwestern border. The eastern portion of Standish is part of the Presumpscot River watershed. Watchic Lake is located within the town.

<text>Westbrook is a city in Cumberland County, Maine, United States and a suburb of Portland. The population was 20,400 at the 2020 census, making it the fastest-growing city in Maine between 2010 and 2020. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
Originally known as Saccarappa after Saccarappa Falls on the Presumpscot River, it was a part of Falmouth until February 14, 1814, when it was set off and incorporated as Stroudwater. It soon changed its name to Westbrook after Colonel Thomas Westbrook, a commander during Father Rale&#x27;s War and King&#x27;s mast agent who was an early settler and mill operator. In 1871, the town of Westbrook amicably split into two municipalities; the current Westbrook and Deering, which was then annexed by Portland in 1898. In 1891, Westbrook was incorporated as a city.

Saccarappa Falls and Congin Falls provided water power for early mills within the city. In 1829, a sawmill was built at the former which made the mill town noted for its lumber. Other industries followed, manufacturing grain bags, machinery and water wheels, carriage and harness, boots, shoes and moccasins, tinware, leather board, bricks, wooden boxes, box shook, meal and flour. The Portland Manufacturing Company built a cotton textile mill at Saccarappa Falls for making &quot;sheetings, stripes and ducks.&quot; A paper mill was built at Cumberland Mills, once an Indian planting ground known as Ammoncongin. By 1859, it produced 1,000 tons of paper annually. In 1867, the factory&#x27;s name would change to the S. D. Warren Paper Mill.

The Cumberland and Oxford Canal opened in 1832, connecting Portland to Harrison by way of Westbrook and Sebago Lake. It was the primary commercial shipping route for goods until 1871, when it was rendered obsolete by the Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad. Remnants of the canal can still be seen throughout the city, including Beaver Pond, along Stroudwater Street near the Maine Turnpike overpass, and in the woods between Westbrook High School and Oxford-Cumberland Canal Elementary School. In 1885, the city opened Woodlawn Cemetery, the largest cemetery and newest burial grounds in the municipality.

==Economy==

Now primarily a suburb of the larger city of Portland, Westbrook itself has a growing business base and developing core downtown district. IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., a major multi-national corporation, is headquartered in Westbrook. In addition to the downtown area, many of the city&#x27;s businesses are located within two industrial parks (the Col. Westbrook Industrial Park and Five Star Industrial Park), as well as in the area surrounding Maine Turnpike Exit 48.

The city is home to Sappi Ltd.&#x27;s Westbrook Paper Mill and R&amp;D Center. The mill, formerly the S. D. Warren Paper Mill, was once the city&#x27;s largest employer and taxpayer, employing over 3,000 people and representing over 50% of the city&#x27;s tax base. However, foreign competition and the age of the mill have drastically reduced its workforce and production. Today the mill has found a niche in the marketplace, becoming one of the nation&#x27;s top manufacturers of release papers and employing about 300 people. Idexx Laboratories has since surpassed the mill as the city&#x27;s largest taxpayer. Westbrook was also the home of the first Sebago-Moc shoe factory.

Westbrook is home to the TV station WMTW, southern Maine&#x27;s ABC affiliate. The station has its studios off County Road.

The faith-based Mercy Hospital of Portland operates Mercy Westbrook, a small community hospital with a minor emergency room and inpatient treatment facilities. Spring Harbor Hospital, southern Maine&#x27;s only private psychiatric treatment and recovery center, is also located within the city.

<text>Windham is a town in Cumberland County, Maine, United States. The population was 18,434 at the 2020 census. It includes the villages of South Windham and North Windham. It is part of the Portland–South Portland–Biddeford, Maine Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
The township was granted in 1734 by the Massachusetts General Court to Abraham Howard, Joseph Blaney and 58 others from Marblehead, Massachusetts. In 1737, New Marblehead Plantation was settled by Captain Thomas Chute. By order of the Massachusetts General Court, a fort was built in spring of 1744 on a hill in the southern part of town near the early center of settlement to offer protection during King George&#x27;s War. A 50-foot square blockhouse, constructed of 12-inch thick hewn hemlock had an overhanging second story, with firing ports and two swivel guns in watch posts on diagonal corners. The blockhouse was surrounded by a stockade wall of 12-inch diameter log posts 16 feet long. The single gate through the stockade wall was covered by a 4.2-inch (11 cm) bore 9-pounder cannon within the blockhouse.

The town&#x27;s inhabitants took shelter in the stockade between 1745 and 1751. The last Indian attack on the town occurred on May 14, 1756. New Marblehead Plantation was incorporated on June 12, 1762, as Windham, named for Wymondham in Norfolk, England. Windham Minutemen marched to Portland in response to the Burning of Falmouth on October 18, 1775, and sixteen men were drafted from the town for the Penobscot Expedition. Thirteen Windham men are reported as being members of the Continental Army with George Washington&#x27;s American Revolutionary War winter encampment at Valley Forge. Windham&#x27;s nine-pounder cannon and one swivel gun from the stockade blockhouse were loaned to Portland in 1775. Portland had refused to surrender these guns to Captain Henry Mowat as he demanded before he burned the town; and they were placed aboard the privateer &quot;Reprieve&quot; in 1776.

Most of the early inhabitants were farmers, who found the soil loamy and easily worked. Early subdivision of land was in strips perpendicular to the Presumpscot River and Pleasant River. Each landowner cleared the river floodplain for cropland and had river access for transportation to the coast until River Road and Old Gray Road (United States Route 202) were built linking connected farm buildings on high ground adjacent to the floodplain. Windham provided numerous sites for water power, and as early as 1738 a mill was erected at Mallison Falls. Edmund Fowler and Lester Laflin began manufacturing gunpowder at Gambo Falls (near Newhall) in 1817.

===Canal===
The Cumberland and Oxford Canal opened in 1832, carrying goods along the Presumpscot River between Sebago Lake and Portland. Population increased along the Presumpscot River as goods manufactured by river water power could be transported to outside markets. In 1859, when Windham&#x27;s population was 2,380, it had eight sawmills, a corn and flour mill, two shingle mills, a fulling mill, two carding mills, a woolen textile factory, a barrel factory, a chair stuff factory, the gunpowder factory and two tanneries. Oriental Powder Company became the largest gunpowder factory in Maine, and remained in operation until 1905, providing rock blasting powder, gunpowder for belligerents in the Crimean War, and 25 percent of the Union gunpowder supply for the Civil War. A charcoal house, saltpeter refinery, mills, and storehouses were separated along a mile of both banks of the Presumpscot River upstream of Gambo to minimize damage during infrequent explosions.

===Railroad===
The canal fell into disuse after the Portland and Ogdensburg Railway was completed through South Windham and Newhall in 1875. Maine Central Railroad leased the railway as their Mountain Division in 1888. Availability of year-round transportation encouraged C.A. Brown and Company to build a large brick wood-paper board factory at South Windham in 1875. Androscoggin Pulp Company purchased the factory, and the industrial village of South Windham developed around the pulp mill. By 1886, the town also produced felt, boots and shoes, carriages, harness, coffins, clothing and wooden ware. On April 4, 1919, the legislature passed an act creating the Reformatory for Men at South Windham. It is now the Maine Correctional Center, a minimum to medium security facility for men and women.

===Highway===
Designation of the transcontinental Roosevelt Trail in 1919 (identified as United States Route 302 since 1935) encouraged increasing numbers of automobile tourists to drive through North Windham. Boody&#x27;s store was built on the northern corner of the intersection of the Roosevelt Trail and Maine State Route 115 to sell grain, groceries, and hardware. The crossroads village of North Windham has expanded into the commercial center of town through increasing automobile use by Sebago Lake vacationers and suburban Portland commuters.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Located beside Sebago Lake, Windham is drained by the Pleasant River and the Presumpscot River.

==== Secondary roads ====
There are several roads that connect certain parts of the town, as well as to other towns, such as Pope Road (Connecting North Windham to Windham Center), River Road (main connector connecting North Windham and Westbrook), Windham Center Road (mainly crosses the town in an east-west direction, as well as connecting Windham Center to Gorham), and Falmouth Road (connects North Windham to Falmouth).

=== Parks and Recreation ===
Windham is home to several parks and recreation facilities including the town hall, Windham Primary school, Manchester Elementary school, Windham Middle and High schools, as well as several parks.

==== Donnabeth Lippman Park ====
Donnabeth Lippman Park is located near the business district off Rte 302. The 123 acres includes a 10 acre pond for fishing, miles of hiking and biking trails around the 10 acre pond, a story-walk trail, and a playground. Various birds and wildlife inhabit the park.

The town was incorporated on February 22, 1802, named for the River Avon in England. One of the Worcestershire villages through which River Avon flows is Eckington, birthplace of Capt. Soule&#x27;s ancestor, George Soule, a &quot;Mayflower&quot; Pilgrim. Capt. Soule&#x27;s son, Bishop Joshua Soule, was raised in Avon.

First known as Plantation No. 4, Abbott&#x27;s Purchase, it was part of a large tract of land bought in 1815 by Jacob Abbott of Wilton, New Hampshire from Jonathan Phillips of Boston, who had purchased an even larger tract from the state of Massachusetts about 1790. Plantation No. 4 was noted for extensive forests of pine and valuable formations of limestone. In 1804, William Bowley and his family from Bristol, New Hampshire settled in Plantation No. 4, and with his brother Oliver and father Gideon, built the first sawmill at what was called Bowley&#x27;s Mills on the Webb River at the foot of Webb Lake. They built a gristmill the following year.

The town was incorporated on February 20, 1826, and named after Carthage, the ancient Mediterranean city in what is today Tunisia in North Africa.

About 1831, the northern half of the township was purchased from the state of Maine by two men, one of whom was Charles L. Eustis of Lewiston. That same year he built a sawmill and gristmill. In 1840, the township was organized as Hanover Plantation, which about 1850 became part of the larger Jackson Plantation. On March 30, 1857, however, the township was set off and organized as Eustis Plantation, named after its early proprietor. Then on February 18, 1871, with a population of 342, it was officially incorporated as a town.

<text>Jay is a town in Franklin County, Maine, United States. Jay was included in the Lewiston-Auburn, Maine metropolitan New England city and town area. The population was 4,620 at the 2020 United States Census. Jay includes the village of Chisholm.

==History==
This was once territory of the Anasagunticook (or Androscoggin) Abenaki Indians, whose main village was Rockameko, located on Canton Point. They were decimated by smallpox in 1757. The township was then granted by the Massachusetts General Court to Captain Joseph Phipps and 63 others for their services in the French and Indian War. Called Phipps-Canada, the plantation was not settled until after the Revolutionary War. On February 26, 1795, Phipps-Canada was incorporated as Jay for John Jay, the first chief justice of the Supreme Court.

Originally in Cumberland County, Jay became part of the formation of Oxford County on March 4, 1805 (affirmed part of Oxford County in 1808), then of Franklin County on May 9, 1838. In 1821, Canton was set off from Jay and incorporated as a town.

Farmers found the soil to be loamy and productive, yielding great quantities of hay, corn, wheat, potatoes, oats and apples. In 1793, a tavern was constructed at Jay Hill. On the Androscoggin River near Jay Hill was erected a toll bridge, then in 1839 a sawmill. At North Jay was built a sawmill, brickyard and granite quarry. White granite from the North Jay Granite Company, established in 1884, would be used to construct numerous important buildings throughout the country, including Grant&#x27;s Tomb. East Jay had a sawmill, and Bean&#x27;s Corner a carriage factory. In 1857, the Maine Central Railroad reached town.

Jay had a population of 1,490 in 1870. The following years would see papermaking develop into the town&#x27;s predominant industry. In 1888, industrialist Hugh J. Chisholm built at southern Jay the Otis Falls Pulp &amp; Paper Company mill, then the third largest paper mill in the country. Nearby developed the mill town village of Chisholm. In 1898, it became one of the founding mills of International Paper. In 1905, International Paper built a mill on the opposite side of the river, which became known as the Otis mill. The mill was known as James River through the 1980s. In 1998, this mill was sold to Wausau Paper from a group of investors. In 1965, International Paper opened the Androscoggin Mill. It is an integrated pulp and finished paper goods plant, employing 990 people operating five paper machines. In 1987-88, it was site of a major strike by members of the United Paperworkers&#x27; International Union against International Paper, which ultimately led to management hiring strikebreakers to permanently replace the strikers. In March 2009, Wausau Paper announced the closing of the Otis mill. Operations there stopped permanently at the end of May 2009.

On April 15, 2020, the Androscoggin Mill was rocked by an explosion, which resulted in the damage of two trucks from falling debris.

== Natural resources ==
In addition to the abundance of trees common to Maine towns, Jay has a large deposit of granite, most notably white granite, and Jay granite has been used in buildings and projects across the nation.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Jay is drained by Seven Mile Stream and the Androscoggin River.

The town is crossed by state routes 4, 17, 133, 140 and 156. It is bounded by the towns of Wilton to the north, Chesterville to the east, Livermore and Livermore Falls to the south, and Canton and Dixfield to the west.

== Education ==
The Jay School Department was owned by The Town of Jay and was governed by a five-member school committee and one superintendent. The district consisted of one elementary, middle and high school. In 2010 the estimated the districtwide student population was approximately 700 students. Jay School Department was recognized as the third smallest school district (with the exception of unorganized territory school districts) in the State of Maine. Because of the size of the school district and excellent ratings the school districts received extra federal funding for being one of America&#x27;s Top Performing School Districts with a population of under 1,000.

During the 2010–2011 school year Jay Elementary School held about 220 students serving grade Pre-K through 3rd. The school was built in the mid-1960s and a small addition was added. The elementary school was redone in the summer of 2018

Jay Middle School in the 2010–2011 school year had an estimated population of about 250 students in grades 4–8. The middle school, finished in 1997, consists of two floors, and is the newest school in the district. The school connects onto the Jay Community Building, where the townspeople vote and special meetings are held. The top floor of community building is where the large gymnasium is located. The Jay School Committee often meets in the middle school cafeteria or library because of the large space.

Jay High School had an estimated population of about 250 during the 2010–2011 school year in grades 9–12. The Jay High School building opened in the fall of 1970 and since then has held high school classes for students in Jay since. The building offers a unique architecture as it has a large domed gym, formerly known as The Tiger Dome; the tigers being the school and district mascot. The large gymnasium makes up about a quarter of the whole building&#x27;s square footage and classes are held in wing off the center of the building.

In 2010 Jay Schools consolidated with RSU 36 encompassing Livermore and Livermore Falls to form RSU 73. Jay High School and Livermore Falls High School were renamed Spruce Mountain High School North and South campuses respectively. The Tigers and Andies mascots were replaced by the Spruce Mountain Phoenix, to signify the rebirth of the schools. Livermore Falls Middle School was closed in the summer of 2011 and the students and faculty were incorporated into the new Spruce Mountain Middle School located at the former Jay Middle School building. Plans to unite the two high schools under one roof were laid with a number of options available, a) Extend the current North Campus facility to accommodate the students and staff from the South Campus, b) Install portable buildings to increase the space at North Campus to facilitate the union of the high schools, c) relocate the Spruce Mountain Middle School to the South Campus and move the South Campus High School to the North Campus. The vote to allow the raising of a bond to enable the building of the planned extension failed in early 2012 and the other options were examined. The School District budget has failed on two successive votes in all three towns following the failed bond vote.

Eventually the south campus was abandoned and all students were moved to the north campus. Many classrooms were divided in half to accommodate the greater number of students. In June 2016, the first class of Spruce Mountain High School to be fully consolidated throughout high school graduated.

<text>Kingfield is a town in Franklin County, Maine, United States. The population was 960 at the 2020 census. Kingfield, the primary village in the town, is a census-designated place.

Kingfield is the principal gateway to Sugarloaf, a major ski resort, and is headquarters to Maine Huts and Trails.

==History==
The first recorded European visitors were John W. Dutton and Nathaniel Kimball in 1805. They returned the following year with their families and began a settlement. In 1807, William King (later to be Maine&#x27;s first Governor) purchased the township as part of the Bigham Plantation. In 1816 Kingfield was incorporated as the 210th town in the Maine District of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

Salomon Stanley was one of the earliest town settlers. His twin sons, Francis Edgar (F.E.) and Freelan Oscar (F.O.) became famous as manufacturers of Stanley Dry Plate, bought in 1903 by Eastman Kodak, and the Stanley Steamer automobile, manufactured from 1902 to 1924. Their sister, Chansonetta, became a photographer renowned for her portraits of local rural life. The Stanley Museum celebrates the family and its accomplishments.

Kingfield supported both agriculture and industry, drawing power from the Carrabassett River to power several sawmills, a clover mill, carding mill, flour mill, tannery, and a rake factory. All these mills are now closed. There was also a depot of a narrow-gauge railroad, which ceased to run in 1936.

In the early 1950s, local residents began developing Sugarloaf Mountain as a ski resort. Today Kingfield is known primarily as a gateway to Sugarloaf. In 2007 Nestlé opened a Poland Spring bottling plant in Kingfield. Kingfield is a Trail Town of the Appalachian Trail, being near Mount Abraham and the Bigelow Range.

<text>Madrid is a former town, now a part of the unorganized territory of East Central Franklin, in Franklin County, Maine, United States. The population was 173 at the 2000 census.

==History==
It was part of an extensive tract of land purchased from Massachusetts about 1790 by Jonathan Phillips of Boston, then acquired by his agent, Jacob Abbott from Wilton, New Hampshire. First settled about 1807 or 1808, it was incorporated as a town in 1836 and named after Madrid, Spain. In 1854, it was the site of Maine&#x27;s first gold strike.

Although Madrid&#x27;s northern topography is mountainous, other parts suited cultivation. In 1837, when the population was 351, farms harvested 3,387 bushels of wheat.

Industry developed because the falls in the Sandy River provided water power for mills: these included three sawmills, a gristmill, two clapboard machines, and two shingle machines. The town was noted for producing lumber and carriages. By 1859, the population was 404. In 1880, it had reached 437.

But in the late 20th century, the population declined, as industry changed and the young moved to larger cities. In April 2000, the town of Madrid disincorporated. Citing &quot;apathy&quot;, its government was dissolved, and Madrid became part of the unorganized territory of East Central Franklin.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (0.14%) is water. Madrid is drained by the head branches of the Sandy River, a tributary of the Kennebec River. Much of the topography is uneven, with the northern portion mountainous. The Appalachian Trail crosses the northwest corner of the town.

The former town is crossed by Maine State Route 4. It bordered the towns of Phillips to the south, with the unorganized territory of East Central Franklin to the north and east.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 173 people, 72 households, and 55 families residing in the town. The population density was . There were 208 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 100.00% White.

There were 72 households, out of which 27.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 65.3% were married couples living together, 5.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 23.6% were non-families. 18.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 5.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.40 and the average family size was 2.71.

In the town the population was spread out, with 23.7% under the age of 18, 3.5% from 18 to 24, 27.7% from 25 to 44, 34.1% from 45 to 64, and 11.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 42 years. For every 100 females, there were 96.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 94.1 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $22,292, and the median income for a family was $29,063. Males had a median income of $16,563 versus $16,429 for females. The per capita income for the town was $12,192. None of the families and 5.5% of the population were living below the poverty line, including no under eighteens and 29.4% of those over 64.

<text>Phillips is a town in Franklin County, Maine, United States. The population was 898 at the 2020 census. It is home to the Sandy River and Rangeley Lakes Railroad, a heritage railroad.

==History==
The plantation was part of a large tract granted by Massachusetts about 1790 to Jonathan Phillips of Boston. It was first settled in 1791 by Perkins Allen from Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, a sea captain who called it Curvo. It was incorporated on February 25, 1812, and named for Phillips. The town was noted both for its productive soil, with hay the chief crop, and its superior water power. At falls along the Sandy River were erected sawmills, gristmills, a fulling mill and a carding machine.

Other industries included a starch factory, tannery, furniture factory, boot and shoe factory, carriage maker, and harness maker. Most significantly, however, Phillips became prosperous as the center for lumbering in the Rangeley Lake region. At first, lumber was shipped during winter months on sledges dragged across the snow by oxen. But then in 1879, the narrow-gauge Sandy River Railroad opened to Farmington, where the Maine Central Railroad carried freight to further destinations. In 1891, the line became the Sandy River and Rangeley Lakes Railroad. Although the railroad closed in 1935, a short section has been revived as a tourist attraction and museum.
==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Phillips is drained by the Sandy River, a tributary of the Kennebec River.

The town is bordered by Madrid and Salem Townships to the north, Township 6 North of Weld to the west, Weld and Avon to the south, and Freeman Township to the east.

Phillips is crossed by state routes 4, 142 and 149.

===Toothaker Pond===
The Sandy River and Rangeley Lakes Railroad followed the west shore of Toothaker pond in the northern part of Phillips. The pond overflows into the Sandy River to the south. Berlin Mills Co. built a sawmill in 1902 using Toothaker Pond as a log pond. The pond shoreline was developed with residences and seasonal cabins after the sawmill closed in 1908. The pond has summer algal blooms and dissolved oxygen deficiencies. It holds Brook Trout, rainbow smelt, golden shiner, Yellow Perch and redbelly dace.

<text>Strong is a town in Franklin County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,122 at the 2020 census. Strong is home to the annual Sandy River Festival.

==History==
The plantation was called Township No. 3, First Range North of Plymouth Claim, West of Kennebec River (or T3 R1 NPC WKR), then successively known as Middletown and Readstown. It was first settled in 1784 by William Read from Nobleboro. Readstown was incorporated on January 31, 1801, and named for Caleb Strong, a Founding Father of the United States and governor of Massachusetts. The Maine Republican Party was founded here on August 7, 1854.

Set on a hilly intervale above a big bend in the Sandy River, the area provided fertile soil for agriculture. Farmers grew hay, wheat, corn, oats and potatoes. The northeast branch of the Sandy River provided water power for mills, helping make Strong prosperous. By 1859, when the population was 1,008, it had sawmills, a gristmill, a fulling mill, a carding machine, a starch factory and a tannery.

The narrow gauge Sandy River Railroad connected Farmington and Phillips in 1879. By 1886, town industries included a boot and shoe factory, machine shops, Maine&#x27;s first cheese factory, a clothespin manufacturer, a maker of cane seat chair bottoms, and an excelsior factory. It was noted as &quot;one of the prettiest villages in the county.&quot;

Strong was called &quot;Toothpick Capital of the World&quot; due to the productivity of the Strong Wood Products Incorporated plant, which once manufactured 20 million toothpicks per day.

==Geography==

<text>Temple is a town in Franklin County, Maine, United States. The town was named after Temple, New Hampshire. It is located at the end of Maine State Route 43 (Temple Road), and is said to be one of only two towns in Maine to be situated at the end of a public highway. The population was 527 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Hill-farmers from Temple, New Hampshire, Old North Yarmouth, Maine, and nearby Farmington settled the town beginning in 1796. It was incorporated in 1803. Commercial sawmills operated on Temple Stream in the village for many years in the 1800s and 1900s, providing the town a robust local economy. Logging is still vibrant in Temple, but its timber is now trucked to mills in nearby towns.
The town contains a town hall (formerly an elementary school), a post office in the former general store (no longer has a post office), a theater (formerly the Congregational Church. The bell tower now sits in a semi-restored state at the town hall), a fire station, and a youth baseball field, established in 1957, commemorating the life of Larry Boyce, the former Temple Townies player and manager for whom the field is named.

What is now Maple Street was once called Cowturd Lane, due to &quot;the smell of manure, fresh from cows walking in the road on their way to (pasture) and back, hanging in the air like swamp gas.&quot;

Temple is a sanctuary for writers, poets, artists, and crafters, and the setting for several novels, biographies, and memoirs: &quot;Shawno&quot; (George Dennison), &quot;Temple&quot; (Dennison), &quot;Temple Stream: A Rural Odyssey&quot; (Bill Roorbach), &quot;Upcountry: Reflections from a Rural Life&quot; (Robert Kimber), &quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Son: An American Boyhood During World War II&quot; (John E. Hodgkins), and &quot;The Town that Ends the Road&quot; (Theodore Enslin).

Besides the above, a number of well-known writers either lived or summered in Temple, including Denise Levertov, Mitchell Goodman, and C. J. Stevens.

<text>Weld is a town in Franklin County, Maine, United States. The population was 376 at the 2020 census. Set beside Webb Lake and almost surrounded by mountains, Weld is noted for its scenery. It is home to Mount Blue State Park, Camp Kawanhee for Boys, and Camp Lawroweld.

==History==

Originally called No. 5 (or Webb&#x27;s Pond Plantation), it was first settled in 1800 by Nathaniel Kittredge and his family from Chester, New Hampshire. The town was part of an extensive tract purchased about 1790 from the state of Massachusetts by Jonathan Phillips of Boston. Phillips was an investor whose agent, Jacob Abbott of Wilton, New Hampshire, resold parcels of the land to settlers. Together with Benjamin Weld of Boston, Abbott and his brother-in-law Thomas Russell Jr. in 1815 bought what remained of the Phillips tract.

Incorporated on February 8, 1816, the town was named for its proprietor, Benjamin Weld, a member of the Weld family. Inauspiciously, 1816 was the Year Without a Summer, when unusually cold weather threatened northeastern communities with famine.

A longtime resident of Weld was Pomp Russell, an African-American man adopted as a very young child by Thomas and Bethia Holt Russell in Andover, Massachusetts in the early 1760s. The only extant record is a church baptism for Pompey, “servant to Thomas Russel” in Andover, MA. on November 18, 1764. Thomas Russell, son of Joseph, was born in Andover, MA June 5, 1732. He and Bethia Holt married May 15, 1760, in Andover, MA. In 1769, Thomas and Bethia and four children (Bethia, Thomas, Jr., Pomp and Hannah) moved to Wilton, N.H. In September 1769, Thomas purchased for £106, 13 shillings and 4 pence, lot 8, and two and a half acres of Lot 7, both in the seventh range, Wilton, New Hampshire. Another son, Daniel, was born a few months after their move to Wilton, N.H.

Pomp Russell served at the Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775 and was later caught spying behind British lines. Russell was lined up to be shot when he managed to escape. About 1781 at age 21, Pomp was awarded his freedom by Thomas, his father and adoptive parent. On June 26, 1788, 
Pomp Russell married Margaret Cutt. In handwritten town records of Packersfield, N.H. the birth on December 5, 1789, of their first child, Peter, is recorded. (Nelson is present day name of Packersfield). In the 1790 U.S. census of Packersfield, N.H., the entry for Pompey Russell shows three free colored people: Pomp, Peggy, and their first-born, Peter. Zadok was born February 1, 1794. Pomp was a farmer, owning one or two cows between 1789 and 1804 and also fencing was mentioned in the handwritten tax records. Come 1804, he was taxed for 1 ton of hay and 3 acres of pasture land. Around this time, Pomp&#x27;s brothers, Abel and Joseph, invited him and his family to leave Packersfield and join them in Weld, Maine where their father Thomas had moved prior to his move to Temple. The brothers had built Pomp&#x27;s family a home on Center Hill in Weld.

Weld is located on a fairly level area of gravelly loam almost surrounded by mountains, some of which are beyond the town&#x27;s limits. Farmers cultivated corn, potatoes, wheat and oats. Weld was noted for numerous and prolific apple orchards. Streams provided water power for mills, which included five sawmills, three box mills, a gristmill and a carding machine. It also produced fork and shovel handles, butter tubs, harness and tinware. Other industries were a starch factory, blacksmith and tannery. By 1870, the population was 1,130.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Weld is situated beside Webb Lake, which is drained by the Webb River, a tributary of the Androscoggin River.

The town is crossed by state routes 142 and 156. It borders the town of Phillips and Unincorporated Township No. 6 to the north, Avon and Temple to the east, and Carthage and Perkins Plantation to the south.

Weld is home to Spruce Mountain and Hurricane Mountain, and considered home to several summits outside the town&#x27;s boundaries, including Tumbledown Mountain and Mount Blue.

From &quot;The New England Gazetteer: Containing Descriptions of the States, Counties ...&quot; by John Hayward. Published 1857, O Clapp: 
:Amherst, ME., Hancock Co.
:This town is bounded on the S. by Mariaville.
:The head waters of Union River pass through it.
:It lies N. of Ellsworth, and E. of Bangor, on the road to Calais.
:It has a Congregational Church and one large tannery.
:This is a good farming town.

From &quot;A Survey of Hancock County, Maine&quot; by Samuel Wasson, Pub. 1878, Sprague, Owen &amp; Nash:

:Amherst. This town, like Aurora, is a square. It is N.N.E. of Ellsworth. It is highly favored in respect to water power. It has one saw, one clapboard, one grist, two shingle mills, and a large tannery. Union River divides the town. East of it is good orchard land. West of the river, excepting the interval, the soil is granitic and the surfaces hilly. Near the &#x27;corner&#x27; is a high ledge, some acres in extent, of a peculiar formation. Rev. Mr. Loring writes, that among its minerals are &#x27;sulphuret of iron, crystals of quartz, slate and granite.&#x27; The high ledge we supposed to be porphyry, containing crystals of iron pyrites and compact feldspar. In the improvement of its stock, Amherst stands unrivaled; and this is due mainly to the energy and enterprise of A. B. Buzzell. Mr Buzzell has employed a mule team for years. The endurance of mules is wonderful; treated to cheap fare, and constant labor, yet rarely disabled or chargeable with lost time. It would be of mutual advantage to Amherst and Aurora, to put up a cheese factory at the &#x27;corner.&#x27; Both towns have entered the cycle of years when farming is to be a paying pursuit. The hides used in the sole-leather tannery of Buzzell &amp; Sons, are principally from South America and Mexico. It was set off from the plantation of Mariaville, in 1822, and incorporated on February 5, 1831. Its name was suggested from Amherst, N.H. It is thought that men began to come in and fell trees in it as early as 1802 or 1803. Among the first that came were Mr. Chapman, Mr. Shumway, Mr. Whitman, John Barker, John Giles, Thomas Harpworth and Mr. Graves. In 1805 Capt. Goodell Silsby came in from Charleton, N.H. In 1806 or 1807 his parents came and took up the lots now known as &#x27;The Old Silsby Place.&#x27; The only meeting-house was erected in 1844. Three men, one living in Amherst and two in Aurora, built it. The first settlers endured many hardships. Some came into Ellsworth, in a vessel, and from that point found their way hither by following a spotted line on the trees. Some carried their grain on their backs to grist mill, and then home again. This is the 26th town. Population, 350. Decennary loss, 34. Wealth, per capita, $165. Area . State valuation, $57, 276. U.S. valuation, $82,477. Union soldiers, 43; State aid, $522; town bounty, $5,300; cost per man, $142.

By 1859, when the population was 1,002, it also had five boot and shoemaking factories, as well as two barrel manufacturers. By 1886, the town was noted for producing smoked herring in considerable quantities. Canning lobster had also become an important business.

An 11th-century Norse coin was (allegedly)
found in Brooklin at the site of an excavation of a Native American trading center. If true this would be the only physical evidence of Nordic settlers having entered the area of what is now the United States. If not an outright hoax, it is also possible that the coin was brought to the site not directly by Vikings, but rather through trading.

<text>Brooksville is a town on Penobscot Bay in Hancock County, Maine, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town population was 935. It contains the villages of North Brooksville, South Brooksville (on Buck&#x27;s Harbor), West Brooksville, Brooksville Corner, and Harborside (on Cape Rosier).

==History==

The Brooksville area has likely been inhabited for over 11,000 years. In the centuries prior to European settler colonists arrival, Native Americans of the Wabanaki confederation lived in the region. The people living in the Brooksville area were probably Penobscot. According to the Brooksville Historical Society there is a story, difficult to confirm, that Englishmen massacred a Wabanaki village at Walker Pond some time between 1690 and 1704. Archaeologists found a grave of Native American origin on the northern edge of Walker Pond in 1912, but the date of the burial was not established.

Brooksville&#x27;s first English settlers were John Wasson, Samuel Wasson and David Hawes, soldiers in the Revolutionary War. Incorporated on June 13, 1817, the town was formed from parts of Castine, Penobscot and Sedgwick. It was named Brooksville after Governor John Brooks of Massachusetts, who then governed Maine.

The surface of the town abounds with granite, and several quarries were established. The soil is a clay loam, which yielded wheat and potatoes. Buck&#x27;s Harbor, safe and deep, is one of the best coves in the region for small boats, and many residents became involved in the coasting trade and fisheries. By 1880, when the population was 1,419, Brooksville had a porgy oil factory, two sawmills, a shingle mill, a planing mill, two gristmills, a wool carding mill, and a cloth and yarn factory. Shipping was an industry, with ship repairs done at the foot of Wasson&#x27;s Wharf Road with a pier to the channel in the Bagaduce. There was a brickyard, blacksmith&#x27;s shop, rope walk and small store for provisions. As late as 1912, there were 18 schooners at the wharf under repair. A small packet, the Goldenrod, ferried passengers from Brooksville to Castine and there was a pier to the south where the Belfast boat berthed. The Wasson and Tapley families, related by marriage, had numerous ship&#x27;s captains, the most notable being the six Tapley sons of Captain Robert Tapley, who all followed the sea after their father.

Brooksville&#x27;s Cape Rosier is named after James Rosier, an early explorer of the Penobscot River.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Brooksville is bounded on the west by Penobscot Bay, on the north and east by the Bagaduce River, a tidal estuary, and on the south by Eggemoggin Reach. It is nearly an island, with just two slim land bridges to the rest of the mainland, and has of shoreline.

Brooksville is crossed by state routes 175 and 176.

<doc id="115979" wikidata="Q1049333" url="?curid=115979" title="Castine, Maine">
<text>Castine ( ) is a town in Hancock County in eastern Maine, United States. 
The population was 1,320 at the 2020 census. Castine is the home of Maine Maritime Academy, a four-year institution that graduates officers and engineers for the United States Merchant Marine and marine related industries. 

Called Majabigwaduce by Tarrantine Abenaki Indians, Castine is one of the oldest towns in New England, predating the Plymouth Colony by seven years. Situated on Penobscot Bay, it is near the site of historic Fort Pentagouet. Few places in New England have had a more tumultuous history than Castine, which proclaims itself the &quot;battle line of four nations.&quot;

During the French colonial period of the 17th and early 18th century, Castine was the southern tip of Acadia, with 
New France defining the Kennebec River as the southern boundary of Acadia. 

The town is named after Jean-Vincent d&#x27;Abbadie de Saint-Castin.

==History==

Its commanding position at the mouth of the Penobscot River estuary, a lucrative source of furs and timber, as well as a major transportation route into the interior, made the peninsula occupied by the present-day town of Castine of particular interest to European Colonialization in the 17th century. 

Majabagaduce (as the Indian name would be corrupted) changed hands numerous times with shifting imperial politics. At one time or another, it was occupied by the French, Dutch and England&#x27;s Plymouth Colony.

===Contested territory===
Castine was founded in the winter of 1613, when Acadian leader Claude de Saint-Étienne de la Tour established a small trading post to conduct business with the Tarrantine Indians (now called the Penobscots).
In 1613, a raid by English captain Samuel Argall at Mount Desert Island signaled the start of a long-running dispute over the boundary between French Acadia to the north and the English colonies to the south. There is evidence that de La Tour immediately challenged the English action by re-establishing his trading post in the wake of Argall&#x27;s raid. Captain John Smith charted the area in 1614 and referred to French traders in the vicinity. 

In 1625, Charles de la Tour erected a fort named Fort Pentagouet. English colonists from the Plymouth Colony seized it in 1628, and made it an administrative outpost of their colony. Colonial Governor William Bradford personally traveled there to claim it.

In 1635, it was retaken by the French and again incorporated into Acadia; Governor Isaac de Razilly sent Charles de Menou d&#x27;Aulnay de Charnisay to retake the village. In 1638, d&#x27;Aulnay built a more substantial fort named Fort St. Pierre. 

Acadian Emmanuel Le Borgne with 100 men raided the settlement in 1653. Major General Robert Sedgwick led 100 New England volunteers and 200 of Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s soldiers on an expedition against Acadia in 1654. Before taking its capital Port Royal, Sedgwick captured and plundered the French settlement at Pentagouêt. The English occupied Acadia for the next 16 years.

In 1667, after the Treaty of Breda brought peace, French authorities dispatched the Baron Jean-Vincent de Saint-Castin to take command of Pentagouêt. The baron married an Abenaki woman, the daughter of the sachem Modockawando. She adopted the French name Mathilde and bore him 10 children. The baron became a widower and then married another Abenaki woman named Marie Pidiwammiskwa who bore him two additional children. Castine soon became a force in colonial trade and diplomacy.

Castine served as the Acadian regional capital between 1670 and 1674.

During the Franco-Dutch War (1674), Pentagouët and other Acadian ports were captured by the Dutch captain Jurriaen Aernoutsz who arrived from New Amsterdam, renaming Acadia, New Holland. The Dutch turned the fort&#x27;s cannon on its own walls and destroyed most of it after the second siege. Saint-Castin himself retook it in 1676 and renamed the town Bagaduce, a shortened version of Majabigwaduce.

During King William&#x27;s War, Saint-Castin&#x27;s settlement was plundered by English Governor Sir Edmund Andros in 1688. In response, Saint-Castin led an Abenaki war party to raid the English settlement at Pemaquid (present-day Bristol, Maine) in August 1689. In 1692 the village was again seized by the English, when Major Benjamin Church destroyed the fort and looted the settlement. With the return of Baron de Saint-Castin and his sons to France, the settlement became sparsely occupied.
During Queen Anne&#x27;s War, in response to the French Raid on Deerfield in February 1704, New England Colonel Benjamin Church raided Saint-Castin&#x27;s settlement (then known as Penobscot) before moving on to raid the Acadian villages at present-day St. Stephen, New Brunswick, Grand Pré, Pisiguit (present-day Windsor, Nova Scotia), and Chignecto. Saint-Castin&#x27;s daughter was taken in the raid.

===British colony===
At the end of the French and Indian War, which secured English title to North America, the unoccupied lands along the Maine coast were opened to settlement by Massachusetts colonists. By the late 1760s, farmers, artisans, and small traders were beginning to take title to properties in and around &quot;Major Baggadoose.&quot; Though the fur trade was long dead, the region&#x27;s abundant fisheries and timber attracted entrepreneurs, and the attention of the British government, which was always on the lookout for store to supply its growing navy. Bagaduce was especially valuable for supplying timber suitable for masts on British warships.

===American Revolution===
In early July 1779, nearly three years after the American Patriots had declared independence from Britain, a British naval and military force under the command of General Francis McLean sailed into Castine&#x27;s commodious harbor, landed troops, and established the colony New Ireland. They began erecting Fort George on one of the highest points of the peninsula. Alarmed by this incursion, the Massachusetts legislature dispatched what became known as the Penobscot Expedition. The military expedition consisted of a fleet of 19 armed vessels and 24 transports, carrying 344 guns, under Dudley Saltonstall, and a land force of about 1,200 men, under General Solomon Lovell, seconded by Gen. Peleg Wadsworth. Col. Paul Revere was given charge of the ordnance.
Although badly outnumbered, British soldiers of the 74th Regiment of Foot (Argyle Highlanders), managed to repel American attacks for nearly three weeks. In mid-August, British reinforcements appeared at the head of the bay. The Americans eventually abandoned the fight and retreated up the Penobscot River, destroying their entire fleet along the way to keep it out of British hands. The failed Penobscot Expedition, which cost the revolutionaries $8 million and 43 ships, proved to be the greatest American naval defeat until Pearl Harbor in 1941. The 74th Regiment held Majabagaduce until the end of the war, when it was ceded to the Americans as part of the peace settlement. Saltonstall and Revere were later court-martialed, charged with cowardice and insubordination; the boards found Saltonstall guilty, but acquitted Revere.

At the end of the Revolutionary War, many American Loyalists in the area migrated eastward to the Canadian Maritimes, some towing their houses behind their boats. Subsequently, known as United Empire Loyalists, they crossed the newly established international boundary line of the St. Croix River and established St. Andrews, one of the oldest towns in New Brunswick. In addition, many soldiers of the 74th chose to be disbanded in St. Andrews (last muster May 24, 1784), and took up land grants there along with the Loyalists, rather than return to Britain.

===Incorporation===
In 1762, the Provincial General Court granted the land designated as Township Number Three, commonly known as Majorbigwaduce or Majabigwaduce, to a group of proprietors. After some disputes concerning the proprietors&#x27; claims to the land, the General Court of Massachusetts recognized Township No. 3 and incorporated it as the Town of Penobscot in 1787. Penobscot then included what are now the towns of Castine, Penobscot, and Brooksville. On February 10, 1796, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts passed an act which separated Penobscot into the towns of Castine and Penobscot. Castine held its first town meeting on April 4, 1796.

===War of 1812===

The population reached 1036 in the 1810 Census. During the War of 1812, from his base in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in August and September 1814, Sir John Coape Sherbrooke sent a naval force and 500 British troops to conquer Maine and (again) establish the colony of New Ireland. In 26 days, they succeeded in taking possession of Hampden, Bangor, and Machias, destroying or capturing 17 American ships. They won the Battle of Hampden (losing two killed while the Americans lost one killed) and occupied the village of Castine for the rest of the war. A raging smuggling trade developed between Castine and the rest of Maine during its occupation. The Treaty of Ghent returned this territory to the United States. The British left in April 1815, at which time they took 10,750 pounds obtained from tariff duties at Castine. This money, called the &quot;Castine Fund&quot;, was used in the establishment of Dalhousie University, in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The population was 975 at the Census of 1820.

===1820–1960===

With the growth of the postwar economy, the town became a prosperous place: the seat of Hancock County and a center for shipbuilding and coastal trading. By the 1820s, it had become a major entrepot for American fishing fleets on their way to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. It also prospered from the lumber industry, in which eastern Maine dominated before the Civil War. During this period of growth and prosperity, many of the handsome Federal and Greek Revival style mansions that still grace the village&#x27;s streets were constructed.
Castine declined after the Civil War. By then its fleet, which once sailed the globe, carried coal, firewood, and lime to coastal ports in competition with railroads and steamships. Ambitious young people sought their fortunes elsewhere. In 1838, the Hancock County seat moved to Ellsworth.

By the 1870s, Castine&#x27;s quaint old architecture and cool summer air attracted &quot;rusticators&quot;—well-to-do urban families seeking rest and recreation. Its charms also drew activists, including Harriet Beecher Stowe and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, whose writings romanticized its past. By the 1890s, wealthy families from Boston, Hartford and Chicago were buying up old farms and sea captains&#x27; houses. Hotels and inns opened as Castine became a flourishing summer colony. Since 1867, it had been site of the Eastern State Normal School.

In the 1930s, the Great Depression and the automobile killed off the hotel trade, the steamship lines that had linked coastal towns and islands, and the local fishing industry. The fortunes of the community did not revive until the 1960s, with the rediscovery of the town&#x27;s charms by a new generation of summer tourists.

===1980s–2000s===

A key element in the revival of Castine has been the expansion of the Maine Maritime Academy. Established in 1941 to train merchant seamen, by the 1980s the academy offered a range of courses in engineering, management, transportation, and nautical and ocean science. Its campus, once the home of the Eastern State Normal School, features a library (available to the public) and extensive athletic facilities.

Castine has a number of historic sites and parks (including the ruins of British earthworks at Fort George), a deep water harbor (with tie-ups for small boats beyond the current of the Penobscot and Bagaduce rivers), a non-exclusive club offering golf, tennis and yachting facilities, restaurants, and four churches (Episcopal, Roman Catholic, Congregational and Unitarian Universalist). In addition, the town has a public library, an historical society, and the Wilson Museum, an institution featuring exhibits of anthropological, natural and local artifacts. Castine&#x27;s streets are lined with Federal, Greek Revival, Cape Cod and other antique style houses, and shaded by large elms which are replaced with disease-resistant strains when they succumb. The Castine Post Office is in one of the oldest Post Office buildings in continuous operation in the United States. The Federal government began leasing the building (built in 1817) in 1833 and later purchased the building. In 1869 the building was renovated to accommodate the Castine Post Office.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Castine is drained by the Bagaduce River estuary.

The town is crossed by state routes 166 and 166A. Situated on a peninsula in Penobscot Bay, Castine is bordered by the town of Penobscot to the northeast, Brooksville across the Bagaduce River to the southeast, and near Islesboro to the southwest.

<text>Dedham is a town in Hancock County, Maine, United States. The population was 1,648 at the 2020 census. The town includes the site of a Cold War airplane crash on Bald Mountain.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The small village corporation of Lucerne-in-Maine lies in a summer resort area along Phillips Lake near the center of the town. It is part of Dedham but has limited taxing and regulatory authority separate from the town&#x27;s. The Lucerne-in-Maine Village Corp. was established in 1927 to give part-time residents a voice in how the village was run. In 2017 the village considered dissolving, but continues as a quasi-municipal corporation .

==History==

===1961 F-101 Voodoo crash===
Two McDonnell F-101 Voodoo fighters of the 75th Fighter Squadron were scrambled from Dow Air Force Base on the night of April 11, 1961, to intercept an unidentified aircraft approaching the United States. SAGE identified the incoming aircraft as a Strategic Air Command bomber shortly after the fighters were airborne. The fighters&#x27; return to Dow was complicated by a light spring rainstorm, creating an icy runway under a 500-foot cloud ceiling. Dow&#x27;s tactical air navigation system glide slope function was temporarily disabled after the first aircraft landed. The second aircraft was cleared to descend to 2,200 feet, using a two-dimensional radar approach, when it hit Bald Mountain at an elevation of 1,200 feet. Both crewmen in the second aircraft were killed. Investigators concluded the airfield elevation had been incorrectly set on the aircraft altimeter, creating a 1000-foot error unrecognized when aircrew acknowledged only the last two digits of altimeter readings in radio transmissions.

<text>Deer Isle is a town in Hancock County, Maine, United States. The population was 2,194 at the 2020 census. Notable landmarks in Deer Isle are the Haystack Mountain School of Crafts, Stonington Opera House, and the town&#x27;s many art galleries.

==History==

The town was incorporated in 1789, at which time it included the islands of Little Deer Isle, Deer Isle, and Isle au Haut. Deer were abundant on these islands, hence the name. In 1868 Isle au Haut became a separate town. In 1897, the southern third of Deer Isle incorporated as the town of Stonington.

In the 19th century, the granite industry flourished on Deer Isle where its quarries supplied granite for structures such as the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Smithsonian Institution, the US Naval Academy, the Manhattan Bridge, and President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s tomb at Arlington National Cemetery.

In John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;Travels with Charley&quot;, Deer Isle was a stopping point for the author after the insistence of his literary agent that he visit the cottage of Eleanor Brace, at Dunham&#x27;s Point. Steinbeck wrote, &quot;One doesn&#x27;t have to be sensitive to feel the strangeness of Deer Isle&quot;.

It was Deer Isle that musician Dan Fogelberg and his wife Jean chose for their final home, and where he died in 2007. This isle was the home town of the dock that was the inspiration for the painter Fairfield Porter. Many small private islands can be found in the waters surrounding Deer Isle. Cabot Lyford, a Maine sculptor, used seven tons of Deer Isle granite to carve one of his best known pieces, &quot;Life Force&quot;. The sculpture, which depicts dolphins jumping from the water, stands outside the Regency Hotel in Portland.

==Geography==

=== Areas ===

Eastbrook is a Municipality, governed by a New England Town style government with a board of selectmen and an annual open Town Meeting. While it is unitary municipal authority within Hancock County, the Town is essentially a series of small enclaves, hamlets, and villages, which encompass the geographic features of the area. The most well known are:
* Eastbrook Village / Greenwood Grange: located at the crossroads of Molasses Pond Road &amp; Rte 200. Location of the Eastbrook Church, Municipal Offices, and a feel hope mes.

* Deep Cove: a small hamlet of a few camps and cottages on Molasses Pond’s eastern shore. 
* Western Shore / Macomber Mill: located along Neck Hill Ridge on the west shore of Molasses, running down in to Franklin. 
* Sugarhill: a Hamlet on the hill of the same name, with a view dominated by Molasses Pond and the Schoodic Foothills. 
* Roaring Brook: a few homes and camps scattered along a brook of the same name. 
* Webb Pond: homes, camps, and cottages along the shores of the same named Pond. 
* Abrams Pond: same as above. 
* Bull Hill: site of the Bull Hill Wind Power Project. 
* Township 16: a separate, survey township to the west of the town.

* Martin’s Ridge: visible from parts of town, this area is primarily within the Blackswoods and Franklin.

Eastbrook was named for its relationship to the Union River watershed, being the site of the eastern branches that fed the river. 
Adjacent to the towns of Waltham, Mariahville, Fletchers Landing Township, Franklin, Blackswoods Township, and inland Unorganized Central Hancock County, Eastbrook is considered part of Downeast Maine’s interior. The area hosts the Annual &quot;Eastbrook Days Festival&quot;, typically with events at the Molasses Pond House beach area or the Village proper.

=== Culture ===
Molasses Pond is mentioned in N. Galen Havey’s &quot;Memoirs of the Sweet Life on Molasses Pond&quot;. 
Roaring Brook is the site of an alleged incident as described abstractly in the song &quot;Where the East Brook Roars&quot; by local musician and artist Chris Ross. 
The Molasses Pond Writers Creative Collaborative Workshop meets at the Pond of the same name

Various flora &amp; fauna are native to the region, such as: loons, trout, sunfish, eagles, moose, and deer.

In summer months, the Blueberry Barrens become dotted with labourers and machinery, for the Maine Blueberry harvest. Lumber and gravel is also sourced within the town.

=== Local Lore ===
Molasses Pond is reputed to be so-named due to a series of canoes that sank to the bottom due to being overfilled with molasses and maple syrup sugar, having been harvested from trees on Sugarhill and being sent down the lake to Scammons and from there through the Macomber Mill Marshes to other lakes towards Hog bay and Frenchmans Bay. Allegedly, it is also reported to be named for either Molly Molasses or another notable native figure. According to the Pond’s Facebook fan page, this and nearby Sugarhill have given rise to the term “the way the sweet life should be”, an homage to Maine’s secondary motto: “the way life should be”.

Nearby Blackswoods and Catherines Hill(Maine) are the site of a local ledges involving paranormal local folklore and urban legends, surrounding the ghost of blackwoods road.

Cavehill’s eponymous cave-in-a-hill, also is rumoured in stories to be the site of treasure, ghosts, or historic events.

==== Regional Development ====

The area is also populated by a series of hills and hollows, as part of the inland Schoodic Foothills and Outback region of Hancock County, Maine. 
In the late 2000s developers sought permission to construct various renewable energy projects in land within or adjacent to the Town, such as the Bull Hill Wind Power Site.
