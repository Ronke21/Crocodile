==History==
The Lenape Native Americans tilled the soil, hunted in the woods, and fished in the rivers and streams before the Dutch arrived in the early 18th Century. The Dutch settlers, though, left an indelible mark on the area. Early records show that after the English takeover of New Netherland, English Governor Philip Carteret in 1669 granted a real estate speculator named Balthaser De Hart a strip of property which extended east and west from the Hudson River to the Tiena Kill, and north and south from today&#x27;s Cresskill into Palisades, New York. It is within these geographical boundaries that lies what is now known as Closter. The first land grant deed for the area today known as Closter was not written until April 13, 1671. The northern half of this tract of land consisting of (extending from what is Closter Dock Road northward) was purchased by Barent and Resolvert Nagel on April 25, 1710, who along with the Vervalen family first settled what is now Closter.
The name Closter is of Dutch origin and first appears in a November 18, 1721 deed between the surviving Tappan Patentees and Peter Haring (who owned land in Harrington Park/Norwood east of Tappan Road and between Harrington and Blanche Avenues)—the meets and bounds of the deed begin “Beginning at the bridge which comes out of the Clooster by the Dwars Kill...&quot; (At that time, Closter was considered part of New York State). In the Dutch language, &quot;Klooster&quot; or &quot;clooster&quot; means &quot;a quiet place, a monastery or cloister.&quot; The name was originally pronounced with an &quot;ow&quot; sound, phonetically, &quot;Klowster.&quot; Later, just before the American Revolution, these isolated settlers began to feel the impact of the British Crown in their lives—not only in governmental affairs but also by the influx of English culture on their own language and practices. As a result, the &quot;K&quot; in Klooster was dropped and was replaced with a &quot;C&quot; so the now growing village became known as Clooster. By 1795, with the emerging new American culture, the second &quot;o&quot; in Clooster was dropped, and the American English &quot;long o&quot; sound was adopted which led to today&#x27;s pronunciation of Closter.

The topography gave a sense of isolation and protection, tucked behind the highest point of the Palisades and protected by limited access. Alternatively, sources indicate that the name derives from an early settler named Frederick Closter who is said to have been granted the land in the area in the 1600s.

Reminders of Closter&#x27;s early Dutch history abound - with local streets named after some of the early families (Bogert, Demarest, Durie, Naugle, Parsells, Vervalen, Auryansen, Haring, and Westervelt), and a rich collection of unique Jersey Dutch houses.

The arrival of the Northern Branch in 1859, followed by additional train service from what became the West Shore Railroad, brought residents to the community who could commute to Manhattan via the ferry across the Hudson River at the railroad&#x27;s Weehawken depot. Closter&#x27;s central location earned it the nickname &quot;Hub of the Northern Valley&quot;.

Closter was formed as an incorporated municipality by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on January 1, 1904, from portions of Harrington Township. On March 29, 1904, Harrington Park was created from portions of Closter, Harrington Township and Washington Township.

After the turn of the 20th century, Closter changed from being sprawling estates and farms into an upper middle class suburban town.

==Government==

===Local government===
Dumont is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 (of the 564) municipalities statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Dumont is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of the Borough of Dumont is Republican John W. Russell III, whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. Members of the Dumont Borough Council are Doreen Aponte (R, 2025), Tom Kelly (R, 2024), Christopher Kourelakos (R, 2026), Daniel L. Labarbera (R, 2026), Donald Morrell (R, 2025) and Carole Stewart (R, 2024; appointed to serve an unexpired term).

In March 2018, the borough council appointed Lisa Rossillo to fill the seat expiring in December 2019 that was vacated by Barbara Correa following her resignation. Rossillo served on an interim basis until the November 2018 general election, when she won election to serve the balance of the term of office.

In February 2017, the borough council selected Jared Geist from a list of three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2017 that had been vacated by Matthew Hayes, who resigned from office the previous month, due to illness.

===Local government===
Elmwood Park is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of Elmwood Park is Republican Robert Colletti, whose term of office expires December 31, 2027. Members of the borough council are Council President Theresa Sheridan (R, 2024), Tanisha Dennis (D, 2024), Francesco Fasolo (D, 2025), Daniel Golabek (D, 2025), Lorraine Pellegrine (R, 2026) and Pamela Troisi (R, 2026).

After being denied support by the Democratic Party in her re-election bid, Lorraine Pellegrine announced in March 2023 that she would switch parties and run as a Republican in the November general election.

Republican Richard A. Mola served continuously as mayor for nearly 45 years, from 1972 (a year before the borough&#x27;s name was changed from East Paterson) until his death in 2016. He was replaced by Robert Colletti on an interim basis. In May 2019, Daniel Golabek was selected from three candidates nominated by the Democratic municipal committee to take the mayoral seat after Frank Caramanga resigned in the wake of accusations that he had completed voter ballots. In June 2019, Francesco Fasolo was appointed to fill the seat expiring in December 2019 that became vacant when Daniel Golabek took office as mayor in April.

<doc id="124980" wikidata="Q986210" url="?curid=124980" title="Englewood, New Jersey">
<text>Englewood is a city in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Englewood was incorporated as a city by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 17, 1899, from portions of Ridgefield Township and the remaining portions of Englewood Township. As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 29,308, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 2,161 (+8.0%) from the 2010 census count of 27,147, which in turn reflected an increase of 944 (+3.6%) from the 26,203 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==

===Etymology===
Englewood Township, the city&#x27;s predecessor, is believed to have been named in 1859 for the Engle family. The community had been called the &quot;English Neighborhood&quot;, as the first primarily English-speaking settlement on the New Jersey side of the Hudson River after New Netherland was annexed by England in 1664, though other sources mention the Engle family and the heavily forested areas of the community as the derivation of the name. Other sources indicate that the name is derived from &quot;wood ingle&quot;, meaning &quot;woody nook&quot;, or that the name was coined anew.

Numerous other settlements in the United States were named for Englewood as settlement in North America expanded westward. J. Wyman Jones is credited with convincing residents to choose Englewood for the city&#x27;s name when it was incorporated over such alternatives as &quot;Brayton&quot; and &quot;Paliscena&quot;.

===Pre-Colonial and Colonial eras===
Englewood, like the rest of New Jersey, was populated by Lenape Native Americans prior to European colonization. The Lenape who lived in the Englewood region were of the &quot;turtle clan&quot; which used a stylized turtle as its symbol. 2,000 Lenape originally lived in Englewood, but due to conflicts with the Europeans their population dwindled down to 50 by 1832.

When Henry Hudson sailed up what would become known as the Hudson River in 1607, he claimed the entirety of the watershed of the river, including Englewood, for the Netherlands, making the future region of Englewood a part of New Netherland. However, the region remained largely unsettled under Dutch rule as the Dutch did little to encourage settlement north of modern Hudson County, as the imposing New Jersey Palisades blocked expansion on the west bank of the Hudson.
In 1664, after the Dutch surrendered all of New Netherland to England, the rate of settlement picked up. The English were generous with land grants, and many families, not only English but also Dutch and Huguenot, settled the area, which during the colonial era was known as the English Neighborhood. Street names in Englewood still recall the relative diversity of its earliest settlers; Brinckerhoff, Van Brunt, Lydecker, Van Nostrand and Durie (Duryea), all Dutch; Demarest (de Marais), DeMott and Lozier (Le Sueur), French Huguenot; and Moore, Lawrence, Cole and Day, English.

===Historical notes===
From 1906 until March 16, 1907, when it burned down, Englewood was the site of Upton Sinclair&#x27;s socialist-inflected intentional community, the Helicon Home Colony. Associated with the project were Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Sinclair Lewis.

Direct distance dialing, which allowed callers to reach other users outside their local calling area without operator assistance, was introduced to the public in Englewood. On November 10, 1951, Englewood Mayor M. Leslie Denning made the first customer-dialed long-distance call, to Mayor Frank Osborne of Alameda, California. As of that date, customers of the Englewood 3, Englewood 4 and Teaneck 7 exchanges, who could already dial some exchanges in the New York City area, were able to dial 11 cities across the United States by dialing the three-digit area code preceding the local number.

Two years after his graduation from Fordham University, Vince Lombardi began his football coaching career at Englewood&#x27;s St. Cecilia High School, which closed in 1986.

The Sugarhill Gang recorded &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; in 1979, the first hip hop single to become a Top 40 hit.

==Government==

===Local government===

In 1980, Englewood switched from a Mayor-Council form of government to a modified Council-Manager plan of government in accordance with a special charter granted by the New Jersey Legislature. The city is one of 11 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use a special charter granted by the Legislature. The governing body is comprised of the Mayor and the City Council. Under this charter, the mayor has powers to appoint and veto, while the council functions as a legislative body, with some power to appoint and confirm appointments. The city is divided into four wards which are approximately equal in population. The City Council includes five members, each elected for a three-year term. Four are elected from the individual wards in which they live and the other is elected by a citywide vote as an at-large member. Administrative functions are responsibilities of the City Manager. The six seats in the governing body are elected in a three-year cycle as part of the November general election, with wards two and four both up together, followed a year later by wards one and three, and then the at-large council and mayoral seats. Each ward votes in two of the three years in the cycle, once for its ward seat, in the other year for the two positions voted at-large and one year with no election.

The mayor appoints members to the Planning Board, the Library Board of Trustees, and, with council confirmation, the Board of Adjustment. The mayor serves on the Planning Board. The mayor attends and may speak at council meetings, but only votes to break a tie for passage of an ordinance or resolution. The mayor has veto power over ordinances, but can be overridden with votes from four council members. The City Council is the legislative branch of government, deciding public policy, creating city ordinances and resolutions, passing the city budget, appropriating funds for city services, and hiring the City Manager. The City Council meets generally four times per month (except during summer months).

, the Mayor of Englewood is Democrat Michael Wildes, whose term of office ends December 31, 2024. Members of the City Council are Charles Cobb (D, 2024; At-Large), Angela David (D, 2026; Ward 3), Kenneth Rosensweig (D, 2026; Ward 1), Kevin A. Wilson (D, 2025; Ward 4) and Lisa Wisotsky (D, 2025; Ward 2).

The Englewood Fire Association, a volunteer company established in 1887 as the city&#x27;s first organized fire protection service, built a firehouse on North Van Brunt Street, near the site of Englewood&#x27;s current city hall. A professional paid fire department was created in 1912 with the establishment of a Board of Fire Examiners. The fire headquarters constructed on William Street in 1926 was used for 90 years until its replacement by the Jack Drakeford Englewood Firehouse on South Van Brunt Street, which was dedicated on May 14, 2016. The department has a uniformed force of 57 members, including a Chief, Deputy Chief, 4 Captains, 9 Lieutenants and 42 firefighters.

The line would stop at Englewood Route 4 and Englewood Town Center and terminate at Englewood Hospital and Medical Center. A station stop at Depot Square is the city&#x27;s much-preferred alternative to NJT&#x27;s proposed new Englewood Town Center Station to the south. Englewood Mayor Frank Huttle III worked with Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop to advocate on behalf of the project and obtain the needed state and federal funding needed to proceed with the plan, with Huttle emphasizing the economic benefits from the project and that the city wanted to host the terminus, which would include a parking garage near Englewood Hospital and additional parking near Palisade Avenue in the commercial center of the city.

<text>Fair Lawn is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, and a bedroom suburb located northwest of New York City. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 34,927, an increase of 2,470 (+7.6%) from the 2010 census count of 32,457, which in turn reflected an increase of 820 (+2.6%) from the 31,637 counted in the 2000 census.

Fair Lawn was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 6, 1924, as &quot;Fairlawn&quot;, from portions of Saddle River Township. The name was taken from &quot;Fairlawn&quot;, David Acker&#x27;s estate home, that was built in 1865 and later became the Fair Lawn Municipal Building. In 1933, the official spelling of the borough&#x27;s name was split into its present two-word form as &quot;Fair Lawn&quot; Borough.

Radburn, one of the first planned communities in the United States, is an unincorporated community located within Fair Lawn and was founded in 1929 as &quot;a town for the motor age.&quot; Fair Lawn is home to a large number of commuters to New York City, to which it is connected by train from two railroad stations on NJ Transit&#x27;s Bergen County Line, the Radburn and Broadway stations.

Fair Lawn&#x27;s motto is &quot;A great place to visit and a better place to live.&quot; Fair Lawn has been rated as one of the top 10 best places to live in New Jersey.

==History and historical significance==
The first settlers of Fair Lawn were members of the Lenape tribe, of Native Americans, a group of hunter gatherers who eventually sold their land to incoming Dutch and Irish settlers and migrated to Pennsylvania. The new colonists turned the region, part of the New Barbadoes Township, into five large farm lots, conjoined by two main roads—Paramus and Saddle River—and named it &quot;slooterdam&quot; (after a V-shaped sluice-like fishing weir built in the Passaic River by the Lenni Lenape). The name stuck until 1791. In the 1800s, these five lots became nine smaller lots, and three new roads—Fair Lawn Avenue, Lincoln Avenue, and Prospect Street—were constructed to encourage mobility between them. Eighty houses were built by 1861, and the renamed Small Lots, now a part of the Saddle River Township and home to multiple vegetable and fruit farms and dairies, became an agricultural community. Berdan Avenue, a new road located near five Berdan family farms, was soon added and Victorian homes were built alongside it and in nearby areas. The grandest of the estates, perched atop a hill by Small Lots Road was David Acker&#x27;s estate &quot;Fairlawn&quot;, from which the township gets its name (Images of America, Page 7).

Rapid suburban development of the town occurred in three sections: the River Road–Fair Lawn Avenue area known as &quot;Memorial Park&quot;, the area at Lincoln Avenue and Wagaraw Road known as &quot;Columbus Heights&quot;, and the area east of the railroad and south of Broadway, known as Warren Point. The development of this section was catalyzed by the &quot;establishment of a post office, a railroad station, and a trolley to the Hudson River&quot; (Images of America, Page 8).

In the 1900s, Fair Lawn residents were displeased about the schooling situation as part of Saddle River Township; the schools were either dilapidated or too far away for Fair Lawn residents, and citizens felt that they were not getting schools comparable to the tax money they were paying. As such, a movement to separate from Saddle River Township was born. Fair Lawn residents petitioned to the state, asking to incorporate as an independent borough, and in April 1924, the borough of Fair Lawn was voted into existence.

Fair Lawn is home to the following eight sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places:
* Peter Garretson House, 4-02 River Road (1974)
* Irregular pattern between Radburn Road and the Erie Rail Road tracks in Radburn (1975)
* G.V.H. Berdan House, 1219 River Road (1983)
* Richard J. Berdan House, 2407 Fair Lawn Avenue
* Cadmus-Folly House, 19-21 Fair Lawn Avenue
* Naugle House, 42-49 Dunkerhook Road – Built in the 1750s, the house was acquired by the borough.
* Jacob Vanderbeck Jr. House, 41-25 Dunkerhook Road – Constructed in 1754, the house was named by Preservation New Jersey as one of New Jersey&#x27;s 10 most endangered historic places
* Radburn station, Pollitt Drive (1984)

Other sites, in addition to those listed above, are also considered historic by the Historic Sites Survey Committee of the Bergen County Historic Sites Advisory Board, including:
* Henry A. Hopper House
* George Washington School (Recommended as a National Register possibility, but needs further documentation)
* Fair Lawn, Berdan, and Prospect Avenues, Plaza and Radburn Roads
* Peter Demarest House on Fair Lawn Avenue
* Warren Bronze and Aluminum Factory on Second Street

In July 1982, an NJ Transit train derailed and crashed into a pasta factory, killing the train&#x27;s engineer. The derailment resulted from a group of teens who had tampered with the tracks. Two of the five youths charged with the crime were convicted of manslaughter for their roles in the incident and were given five-year sentences in a state correctional facility.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 5.22 square miles (13.53 km2), including 5.14 square miles (13.30 km2) of land and 0.09 square miles (0.23 km2) of water (1.70%).

The borough borders Paterson (in Passaic County, across the Passaic River) to the west; Hawthorne across Lincoln Avenue to the West; Glen Rock across Harristown Road, Maple Avenue, the northern border of the former Nabisco plant and its extension north of Garwood Road and Naugle Drive to the north; Ridgewood across the Saddle River to the northeast; Paramus across the Saddle River to the east; Rochelle Park across another point in the Saddle River to the southeast; with Saddle Brook across the two longer portions of South Broadway and their extensions through Rosario Court to the south; and Elmwood Park across the Bergen County Line, New Jersey Route 4 (Broadway), Cyril Avenue and Willow Street to the south. The hills of Wyckoff are visible from the northern neighborhoods of Fair Lawn.

===Neighborhoods===
Fair Lawn is an incorporated collection of diverse neighborhoods, each with its own distinct character and vibe. Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the borough include:

*Berdan Grove, a residential neighborhood of single-family homes behind Thomas Jefferson Middle School, surrounding Berdan Grove Park on Berdan Avenue. This neighborhood is home to the borough&#x27;s highest concentration of Asian Americans and includes Milnes Elementary School.
*Broadway District contains the major commercial thoroughfare of Broadway and houses the Broadway District commuter stop for NJ Transit&#x27;s Bergen County Line train. Roughly located around the Warren Point and Lyncrest areas, the district also extends as far as Morlot Avenue along the tracks, roughly around or a little after Glen Rock Lumber, housing many industries on Banta Place. The Broadway District is mainly a shopping district as it contains many stores, eateries, hobby centers, salons, and other businesses. Not only is it the largest stretch of stores within Fair Lawn, it also houses one of the highest densities of nail and beauty salons in the United States. The Broadway District stretches from the Route 4 split with Route 208 and continues all through Fair Lawn and includes a few blocks of Elmwood Park. Broadway also hosts the route of local Paterson-New York Spanish Transportation minibuses, known locally as guaguas, as a cheaper alternative for commuters to and from New York. It is one of only a handful of Bergen-Passaic-Hudson districts that even offers this service.
*Central Fair Lawn is bounded by Morlot and Fair Lawn Avenues on the south and north, respectively, by River Road on the west, and Route 208 on the east and northeast. The borough&#x27;s Municipal Complex, which houses its administrative, legal, financial, and police divisions, is located in this neighborhood, as are the Fair Lawn Public Library, Fair Lawn High School, and John A. Forrest Elementary School.
* Dunkerhook, the Dark Corner (Donckerhoek in old Dutch), is on both sides of a former bridge over the Saddle River, in Fair Lawn and Paramus, near Fair Lawn Avenue. The Vanderbeck and Naugle houses there are both from the 18th century.
* The Heights, more precisely known as &quot;Columbia Heights&quot;, is located near Hawthorne&#x27;s industrial section along the Passaic River on Wagaraw Road and Hawthorne&#x27;s residential area at Lincoln Avenue as well as bordering Bunker Hill in Paterson. This well-maintained neighborhood houses some local industry outside of the McBride Industrial District that borders Glen Rock and is known by some of its residents as the &quot;Bunker Hill Extension&quot; or the &quot;Walsh Area&quot;.
*Hendersonville, also referred to as &quot;Riverside East&quot;. This diverse neighborhood, located between Columbia Heights and the Municipal Complex within the &quot;Westmoreland District&quot;, as well as sharing Route 208 with the neighboring borough of Glen Rock, is a mostly residential community of two-family Cape Cod-style houses located down the stretch of Henderson Boulevard curving around to 11th Street. Distinct to this neighborhood in comparison with other two-family districts and sections is that each Cape Cod has two doors in the front so each residing family has its own entrance into its respective quarters, a blueprint that was abandoned shortly after being built in favor of a &quot;one door, two entrances&quot; model. Westmoreland Elementary School is located in this neighborhood.
* Lyncrest neighborhood, located south of Morlot Avenue, in alignment with Paterson&#x27;s 33rd Street split into that city&#x27;s Upper Eastside and Eastside neighborhoods, is an extension of the Eastside and notable for its older, stone houses in the footsteps of homes once owned by Paterson&#x27;s former silk barons. This community is also diverse, with immigrants from Europe, Asia, the Middle East, as well as various parts of the Americas. It is home to many Orthodox Jewish, Indian American, and Russian American families, among other ethnic and religious groups. Lyncrest streets &quot;1st-6th&quot; are also known by the name of &quot;Rivercrest&quot; by locals, due to the split level and Cape Cod-style architecture of housing located in the &quot;River Dip&quot; adjacent to Memorial Park. Lyncrest Elementary School is located in this neighborhood.
* McBride Industrial District is the area incorporating the McBride Industrial Park located between Fair Lawn Borough&#x27;s border with Glen Rock and the Chandler Houses and Fair Lawn Commons communities. It currently houses the former Nabisco cookie factory, which has played a major role in not only Fair Lawn&#x27;s identity itself, but also Glen Rock, Ridgewood, Paterson, Prospect Park, Haledon, Hawthorne, and Western Paramus near the Dunkerhook and Saddle River Areas, causing those venturing throughout these areas to coin the nickname &quot;Cookie-City&quot; as a general area term, describing the fragrance of freshly baked cookies that filled these areas on baking days. In the past, the McBride Industrial District took up both sides of Route 208, stretching from Fair Lawn Avenue to the intersection at Maple Avenue and Harristown Road, running up to the Bergen County Line train tracks via the Radburn District, and housing companies such as Nabisco, Kodak, Maxell, and others. More recently the district has been in the process of deindustrialization and corporate gentrification, as older companies fold or move out, replacing industrial properties with residential-commercial &quot;mini-cities&quot;, as well as the headquarters of New Jersey&#x27;s Columbia Savings Bank.
* Memorial Park, a working-class neighborhood (sometimes called the &quot;River Dip&quot;, &quot;East River Area&quot;,&quot;Eastside Dip&quot;, &quot;Riverside&quot;, or the more modern &quot;Yang&quot;; the aerial view of the neighborhood makes a &quot;Ying Yang&quot; symbol with neighboring East Side Park) within and around the River Road Improvement District with street addresses aligned with the corner of 33rd Street and Martin Luther King Way (Broadway) in neighboring Paterson. The Memorial Park neighborhood borders the Passaic River and contains the park next to Memorial Middle School named Memorial Park which houses a World War II Memorial commemorating those who fought in the war. The park is the terminus of the annual Memorial Day parade and the site of the Memorial pool and beach as well as the Independence Day fireworks show. Residential gentrification is occurring with the leveling of two-family rental housing for more modern single-family housing in this area. 
* Radburn is a planned community also housing the landmark &quot;Radburn Plaza&quot; building, which was destroyed in a fire in 2002 and subsequently rebuilt. With its safe and easy access to local businesses and schools, and Fair Lawn&#x27;s largest U.S. Postal Service branch, this neighborhood also offers commuter trains from Radburn station to the Secaucus Junction rail transfer station as well as to the PATH train in Hoboken, both of which provide rail connections to New York City. This neighborhood includes Radburn Elementary School and Daly Field. An annual street fair is held here in June.
* Radrock Estates is a small neighborhood around two streets, Well Drive and Split Rock Road, with a private park within the block they enclose, reminiscent of nearby Radburn but a separate development built about 1940. The entrance street from Fair Lawn Avenue has an entrance pillar on each side displaying the name. The surrounding area to the north and east, while built after World War II, is considered to be an extended part of Radrock Estates. Although it is a very diverse residential section, this neighborhood shares the conveniences of living in Radburn including dining, retail access, as well as rail access from Radburn Station.
* The River Road Improvement District, with an annual street fair in autumn, houses many functional businesses, including numerous banks, ethnic restaurants and supermarkets, small offices, retail telecommunications outlets, both a United Parcel Service store and a U.S. Post Office branch, and the landmark Joker&#x27;s Child comic book store. River Road in this district is also zoned for apartments located above businesses.
* Warren Point, a residential area located near the Broadway Improvement District. Bordering Saddle Brook and Elmwood Park, it has many stores, big and small, and many eateries. The neighborhood also offers commuter trains from Broadway station to Hoboken&#x27;s PATH and to Secaucus Junction via the Bergen County Line, as well as the &quot;Paterson-New York Shuttle&quot;. Warren Point Elementary School and the private St. Anne School are located in this neighborhood.

Other neighborhoods in the borough include &quot;Fair Lawn Commons&quot; (The Commons) off Route 208, located within the Radburn Historical District, yet which has a separate, more affluent feel and modern look and subculture; Radburn&#x27;s El Dorado Village, which is known for its Eastern European immigrant residents; and just to its west, the &quot;Chandler Houses&quot;. Fair Lawn&#x27;s newest neighborhood is Fair Lawn Promenade (The Promenade), a mixed-use development extending northward from The Commons along Highway 208 North, consisting of apartments, shops, offices, and restaurants, with the motto to be able to &quot;live, shop, work, and play&quot; in one locale.

These distinct communities are located throughout the borough, and each has its own character, making Fair Lawn not just ethnically, racially, and religiously diverse, but also an experientially diverse borough notable even amidst Bergen County&#x27;s diversity on a larger scale.

==Ethnic diversity==
Fair Lawn has a longstanding tradition of ethnic diversity and a tolerance for people of different ethnicities and religious faiths. Continuing steady immigration from Eurasia, Asia, Europe, and Latin America has transformed Fair Lawn into an international melting pot, and over 50 languages and dialects are spoken in the borough.

===History of ethnic diversity===
Fair Lawn has been a center for Jewish culture over a period spanning several decades. Since the early 2000s, the Orthodox Jewish population has been increasing significantly and has replaced the earlier decreases in members of the non-Orthodox Jewish sects. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russian Jews began to migrate to Fair Lawn. Fair Lawn&#x27;s Jewish American population has therefore maintained an at least one-third presence overall for several decades. Russian Jews were then followed by Russian Orthodox Christians.

Over 10% of the borough&#x27;s population is of Russian descent, the highest of any community in New Jersey, and increasing with continued migration of Russian Americans from Brooklyn. The size of Fair Lawn&#x27;s Russian American presence prompted a 2014 April Fool&#x27;s satire titled, &quot;Putin Moves Against Fair Lawn&quot;, which erroneously claimed the Russian country was sending its troops directly to Fair Lawn. Fair Lawn also has the largest Israeli American community in Bergen County. On November 22, 2015, the Jewish Historical Society of North Jersey celebrated the grand opening of a permanent home at 17-10 River Road in Fair Lawn, after being housed at various locations, mostly in neighboring Paterson, for decades.

Fair Lawn has historically had a large Italian American population, 19.7% in 2000, but this number is decreasing as the descendants of the original Italian immigrants are being displaced by immigrants from around the globe.

Fair Lawn&#x27;s reputable school district, safe and well-policed neighborhoods, and the borough&#x27;s convenient access to commercial centers and hospitals, a complex network of highways, transit lines, New York City, and Newark Liberty International Airport, have all made Fair Lawn a magnet for new immigrants from several regions around the world. The 2012 American Community Survey conducted by the Census Bureau showed a significant increase in the Asian American population, including the Asian Indian, Filipino American, Chinese American, Korean American, and Vietnamese American populations, and the Polish American population is also growing. The public library in Fair Lawn holds storytelling programs in Hindi and Hebrew languages, while Mandarin Chinese has been taught in the school district since the 2007–2008 school year. Fair Lawn&#x27;s first annual Hindu Holi festival was held in 2022.

A number of places for congregation cater to different nationalities in Fair Lawn, including three Korean churches, one Taiwanese church, Young Israel of Fair Lawn, Saint Leon Armenian Church, and the (Italian American) Cosmos Club of Fair Lawn. Several Filipino organizations are based in Fair Lawn. Between the 2010 Census and the 2013–2017 American Community Survey, Fair Lawn&#x27;s Filipino population was estimated to have increased by more than 50% (from 626 in 2010 to 952 in 2013–2017).

====Immigrants from former Soviet Union====
Given the established presence of Russian Americans in the borough, immigrant nationalities native to other republics of the Former Soviet Union, including Ukrainian Americans, Georgian Americans, Armenian Americans, and Uzbek Americans have also established an increasing presence in Fair Lawn.

As a suburb of New York City, Fair Lawn has a diverse population. The town has a high Jewish immigration population, as well as Muslim immigrants, including Albanian Americans and Macedonian Americans, as well as Latino Americans, including Peruvian Americans and Stateside Puerto Ricans, have settled in Fair Lawn&#x27;s western flank, in the Memorial Park neighborhood between the River Road Improvement District and the Passaic River, where there is also a small but stable African American population.

==Government==

===Local government===
Fair Lawn operates within the Faulkner Act (formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law) under the Council-Manager plan E form of New Jersey municipal government, as implemented as of January 1, 1986, based on direct petition. The borough is one of 42 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. The governing body is comprised of a five-member borough council. Members of the Borough Council serve four-year terms in office and are elected at-large in partisan elections in odd-numbered years on a staggered basis, with either two or three seats coming up for election every other year as part of the November general election. All policy making power is concentrated in the council. At an annual reorganization meeting held after each election, the council selects a mayor, a deputy mayor, and a deputy mayor for community affairs from among its members. The mayor presides over its meetings with no separate policy-making power. A borough manager is appointed by the council to serve as the municipal chief executive and administrative official.

, the members of the Borough Council are acting Mayor Gail Friedberg Rottenstrich (D, term as mayor and on committee ends December 31, 2025), Deputy Mayor Cristina Cutrone (D, term on council ends 2027; term as deputy mayor ends 2025), Deputy Mayor of Community Affairs Joshua Reinitz (D, term on council and as deputy mayor ends 2025), Kris Krause (D, 2027) and Nathalie Salinas (D, 2027; appointed to serve an unexpired term).

Kurt Peluso stepped down from office in February 2024 to take office as borough manager at a salary of $175,000; in his place, Deputy Mayor Cristina Cutrone took over as acting mayor. Gail Friedberg Rottenstrich was appointed as mayor in March 2024 and will serve the balance of the term of office as a mayor while Nathalie Salinas was appointed to fill the seat expiring in December 2027 that had been held by Peluso until his resignation; Peluso will serve on an interim basis until the November 2024 general election when voters will choose a candidate to serve the remainder of the term of office.

In May 2018, the borough council appointed Cristina Cutrone to fill the seat expiring in December 2019 that was vacated by Mayor Lisa Swain when she took office in the General Assembly; Kurt Peluso replaced Swain as mayor and in turn Gail Rottenstrich replaced him as deputy mayor. Cutrone served on the council on an interim basis until the November 2018 general election, when she was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.

Company 2 at Route 208 South (before Maple Avenue Bridge), 
Company 3 located at the corner of Plaza Road and Rosalie Street and 
Company 4 on Radburn Road. Fair Lawn residents are served by the all volunteer Fair Lawn Volunteer Ambulance, Inc., which provides 24/7 emergency medical services. This service is equipped with four state of the art ambulances stocked with all necessary supplies to handle any medical emergency.

Fair Lawn also has a police department that was founded in 1930. In 2014, the department responded to over 400 calls.

==Transportation==
===Roads===
Fair Lawn is interwoven by a robust network of roads. , the borough had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality, by Bergen County and by the New Jersey Department of Transportation.

Fair Lawn is traversed by two state highways, New Jersey Route 4, which connects Fair Lawn to New York City via the George Washington Bridge, and New Jersey Route 208, which links Fair Lawn to the New York City bypass highway Interstate 287.

Fair Lawn has several main roads crossing through it forming a rough 3x3 grid. Running north–south are Saddle River Road, Plaza Road, and River Road (County Route 507) while Broadway, Morlot Avenue, and Fair Lawn Avenue run east–west, and Route 208 runs northwest–southeast. Running east–west between and parallel to Morlot and Fair Lawn Avenues is Berdan Avenue, a residential thoroughfare which is bisected by Route 208 into two discontinuous segments, the western one of which contains Fair Lawn High School.

Broadway becomes Route 4 heading into Paramus and is less than from the George Washington Bridge.

Fair Lawn Avenue is considered the borough&#x27;s main street, containing its borough hall, police station, and public library. The road goes west over the Passaic River into Paterson, and on the east, Fair Lawn Avenue ends at Saddle River Road, which through Dunkerhook Park becomes Dunkerhook Road, and becomes Century Road once in Paramus, at Paramus Road. The intersection of Fair Lawn Avenue and Plaza Road form what could be considered a &quot;town center&quot;, with several shopping plazas and the Radburn train station all within walking distance. In October 2015, a community meeting was held to discuss a vision for this corridor. Other commercial areas include Broadway and River Road.

Route 208 has its southern terminus in Fair Lawn and bisects the borough from the northwest to the southeast, where it eventually merges with Broadway to become Route 4 just west of Fair Lawn&#x27;s border with Paramus. Taken the other direction, Route 208 flows northwest to Interstate 287 in Oakland. Numerous commercial establishments and office buildings line Route 208 along the northwestern half of this limited access highway&#x27;s trajectory through Fair Lawn.

South of Route 4, Saddle River Road goes through the eastern side of Fair Lawn and into Saddle Brook, where it provides a link to both the Garden State Parkway and Interstate 80. North of Route 4, Saddle River Road provides a link to Glen Rock.

====Grid-based address system====

Fair Lawn uses a street address numbering system in which most Fair Lawn addresses are given hyphenated numbers. The address of the borough&#x27;s public library, for example, is 10-01 Fair Lawn Ave. Less than 1% of addresses in New Jersey use this kind of numbering system and Fair Lawn&#x27;s nearly 10,000 hyphenated addresses account for nearly half of them. This numbering system is also used in Queens, New York City. Exceptions to this numbering system generally exist on the Glen Rock, Hawthorne, and Saddle Brook sides of Fair Lawn and within the Radburn development. The system, dating at least as far back as the 1930s, was designed to allow emergency personnel to quickly locate addresses.

The first numbers (before the dash) correspond to block-distances from Broadway (on streets that run North-South) and to the numbered streets in the borough (example: 2nd Street, 17th Street, etc.) on the streets that run East-West; with the highest numbers being in the low 40s, and the lowest numbers being 0–30, etc. Addresses south of Broadway / Route 4 start with a zero and a hyphen, which can cause confusion with those unfamiliar with the grid system. Most GPS systems and online address entry forms do not accept the dash, though addresses entered without the dash are typically handled properly.

===Public transportation===

Fair Lawn is served by the Radburn and Broadway train stations on the NJ Transit Bergen County Line, which offers service to Lower Manhattan via the Hoboken Terminal, and connections at Secaucus Junction to Penn Station in Midtown Manhattan and to most other NJ Transit train lines.

NJ Transit buses include the 144, 145, 148, 160, 164 and 196 routes to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan; the 171 and 175 to the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal; and the 746, 758 and 770 lines, offering local service.

Spanish Transportation and its jitney buses / guaguas operate out of its terminal located one block from the NJ Transit Paterson Terminal on Broadway in downtown Paterson. The two lines, the Broadway and Main Street jitneys, begin at its respective Main Terminal on Broadway, with the Broadway-Washington Heights line heading west on Broadway with frequent local stops then continuing onto Route 4 before crossing the George Washington Bridge and dropping commuters off in front of the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal with access to the A Train. The Main Street-42nd Street route heads south down Main Street and makes frequent local stops through Clifton and Passaic, then makes sporadic non-local stops until undergoing the Lincoln Tunnel, dropping commuters off via 42nd Street in front of the Port Authority Bus Terminal.

===Aviation===
Fair Lawn lies north of Newark Liberty International Airport, approaches to which are directly over Fair Lawn, and northwest of Teterboro Airport. John F. Kennedy International Airport is away and LaGuardia Airport is located to the east, both located in New York City.

<text>Hasbrouck Heights (pronounced HAZ-brook /ˈhæz.bɹʊk/) is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 12,125, an increase of 283 (+2.4%) from the 2010 census count of 11,842, which in turn reflected an increase of 180 (+1.5%) from the 11,662 counted in the 2000 census. An inner-ring suburb of New York City, Hasbrouck Heights is located approximately northwest of Midtown Manhattan and west of Upper Manhattan.

The borough was listed as the third-safest place in New Jersey as well as the eighth-safest municipality in the nation according to a 2022 crime statistic compilation from Safewise.com.

==History==
The area that would become the borough had been known as Corona from the mid-1800s and grew up around the two local railroad stations. The name &quot;Hasbrouck&quot; was chosen in 1889 to honor Jacob Dillon Hasbrouck (1842–1918), general manager of the New Jersey and New York Railroad. In the face of local opposition, the name change was promoted as improving the community&#x27;s public perception and avoiding confusion with the Corona, Queens neighborhood, while &quot;Heights&quot; was added to avoid confusion with a similarly named community in upstate New York.

Hasbrouck Heights was formed by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on August 2, 1894, based on the passage of a referendum on July 31, 1894, and was created from portions of Lodi Township at the height of the &quot;Boroughitis&quot; phenomenon then sweeping through Bergen County. A part of the borough was annexed to Lodi in 1901.

NJ Transit bus routes 161, 163 and 164 provide service to and from the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan; the 76 line serves Newark and Hackensack; and local service is offered on the 709 and 780 routes.

NJ Transit provides rail service via the Pascack Valley Line&#x27;s Teterboro – Williams Avenue station, which is located on the eastern boundary with Teterboro, just across the tracks from the Williams Avenue dead end in Hasbrouck Heights. The station is four stops from the line&#x27;s northern terminus at Hoboken Terminal. Although the rail line&#x27;s tracks lie entirely within the borders of Hasbrouck Heights, and in fact form the borough&#x27;s eastern boundary with Teterboro, New Jersey Transit considers the station to be in Teterboro because passenger boarding, passenger shelter, parking lot, and ingress/egress roads are accessed from that municipality.

In January 2013, New Jersey Transit erected a {{convert|300|ft|adj=on}} chain link fence in the vicinity of the Williams Avenue dead end as a safety measure to prevent pedestrians / commuters from crossing over the tracks illegally to gain access to the trains on the Teterboro side. Hasbrouck Heights Mayor Rose Marie Heck, Assemblyman Tim Eustace, and Hasbrouck Heights commuters have tried to work with New Jersey Transit to find alternative solutions, including installation of a pedestrian rail crossing with swing gates and warning lights. New Jersey Transit has indicated there are no immediate alternatives available since funding is not available.

Teterboro Airport is located on the eastern border of Hasbrouck Heights.

<text>Hillsdale is a borough in the northern portion of Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, within the New York City metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 10,143, a decrease of 76 (−0.7%) from the 2010 census count of 10,219, which in turn reflected an increase of 132 (+1.3%) from the 10,087 counted in the 2000 census.

The populated area today known as Hillsdale took form in the mid-to-late 19th century as land speculators, led by David P. Patterson, developed subdivisions to profit from the coming of the Hackensack and New York Railroad (later New Jersey and New York Railroad). The area was incorporated as Hillsdale Township on March 25, 1898, from portions of Washington Township, which had, in turn, been set off from Harrington Township in 1840. Portions of the township were taken on April 30, 1906, to create the township of River Vale. Hillsdale was reincorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 2, 1923, subject to approval which came in a referendum held on April 24, 1923. The borough&#x27;s name derives from its location in a &quot;dale among the hills&quot;.

==Government==

===Local government===
Hillsdale is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Hillsdale is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of Hillsdale is Democrat Michael Sheinfield, whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. Members of the Hillsdale Borough Council are Council President John Escobar (R, 2024), Anthony DeRosa (R, 2023), Justin P. Fox (R, 2025), Zoltan Horvath (R, 2023), Abby Lundy (R, 2024), Clemente Osso (R, 2026), John Ruocco (R, 2026), and Janetta Trochimiuk (R, 2025).

After Douglas Frank resigned due to health issues, the council selected John Ruocco in September 2017 to replace him as mayor for the seat expiring in December 2019. The council chose Zoltan Horvath from three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill Ruocco&#x27;s vacant council seat expiring December 2017, while Frank Pizzella was selected to serve as council president through the end of the year.

Frank Pizzella was appointed in January 2013 to fill the vacant seat of Michael Giancarlo expiring in December 2013. Giancarlo&#x27;s resignation in December 2012 was one of five that year, with Anthony DeRosa appointed in January 2012 to fill the seat of Donna Schiavone, Leslie Becker appointed to fill the vacancy of Jonathan DeJoseph when he was named as borough administrator, Frank Pizzella replacing Rod Capawana, and John MacEwen replacing the seat that Leslie Becker had briefly occupied.

<text>Little Ferry is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 10,987, an increase of 361 (+3.4%) from the 2010 census count of 10,626, which in turn reflected a decline of 174 (−1.6%) from the 10,800 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==
Little Ferry was formed by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on September 18, 1894, from portions of Lodi Township and New Barbadoes Township, based on the results of a referendum held two days earlier. The borough was formed during the &quot;Boroughitis&quot; phenomenon then sweeping through Bergen County, in which 26 boroughs were formed in the county in 1894 alone.

During the colonial era, the borough was the site of an important ferry crossing between the region&#x27;s towns at Bergen and Hackensack, which was operated by rope on the site starting in 1659, continuing until 1826 when it was replaced by a bridge on the Bergen Turnpike.

Gethsemane Cemetery, an African burial ground, was opened in 1860 and was used for interments until 1924. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.
In the earlier 20th nearby Fort Lee on the Hudson Palisades was home to many film studios of America&#x27;s first motion picture industry. On July 9, 1937, a major fire broke out in a 20th Century-Fox film storage facility in Little Ferry. Flammable nitrate film had previously contributed to several fires in film industry laboratories, studios and vaults, although the precise causes were often unknown; in the Little Ferry fire, temperatures of and insufficient venting were the proximate causes.

Rosie&#x27;s Diner (formerly the Farmland Diner) was used in the 1970s for the filming of Bounty paper towel commercials featuring Nancy Walker as Rosie the Waitress.

&quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine ranked Little Ferry 35th in its 2008 rankings of the &quot;Best Places To Live&quot; in New Jersey.

The Little Ferry Circle connected U.S. Route 46 and Bergen Turnpike. The circle was originally constructed in 1933 in conjunction with the nearby Route 46 Hackensack River Bridge, which crosses the river to Ridgefield Park and beyond to the George Washington Bridge.The circle was largely reconstructed in 1985, allowing vehicles traveling on Route 46 to pass directly through the circle. The circle has been a constant site of accidents, with 40-50 accidents per year at the circle each year from 2004 through 2006. In March 2007, the New Jersey Department of Transportation proposed its latest plan to address issues at the circle. The plan would realign the circle into a straight intersection, complete with turning lanes; prohibit left turns onto many residential streets; and would include construction of a pump station to move water off the oft-flooded highway and into the Hackensack River. This plan was later completed, with the circle no longer in existence.

A mayor and deputy mayor are selected by the council from among its members.

The council is an exclusively legislative body, with responsibility for day-to-day operation of the borough assigned to a manager who acts as the municipal chief executive and executes laws and policies, prepares the budget for council consideration and attends and participates at meetings with a voice, but no vote. The manager recommends improvements and implements those approved, as well as oversees contracts and franchises and reports violations.

<text>Lyndhurst is a township in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 22,519, an increase of 1,965 (+9.6%) from the 2010 census count of 20,554, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,171 (+6.0%) from the 19,383 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==
On February 22, 1840, Hudson County was formed by an Act of the New Jersey Legislature. The newly created county was created from territories that had been Bergen Township since 1691, as well as and from the southern portion of Lodi Township. The portion of Lodi Township taken at this time formed the new Harrison Township in Hudson County. The border between the newly created Harrison Township in Hudson County and the portion of Lodi Township remaining in Bergen County was the New Barbadoes Turnpike, which is now called Paterson Plank Road. Some of the residents of the northern portion of Harrison Township requested to be returned to Bergen County. On February 19, 1852, this area—which had been part of Lodi Township—was returned to Bergen County to become the newly formed Union Township.

On September 21, 1881, Rutherford became the first borough to be formed under the terms of the New Jersey Legislature&#x27;s Borough Act of 1878, based on a referendum of voters that passed the previous day. Rutherford Borough was fully separated from the township form of government in 1890 and acquired an additional portion of Union Township in that year. On April 17, 1889, Boiling Springs Township was created from the northern portion of Union Township. This township was dissolved with the creation of the coterminous Borough of East Rutherford as of March 28, 1894. The borough of North Arlington was created as of March 11, 1896, as the result of a referendum that took place two days earlier. Finally, on March 27, 1917, the residents of the remaining portions of Union Township passed a referendum to change the name to Lyndhurst Township, which became effective as of May 15, 1917. The township is named for Lord Lyndhurst.

Kingsland is a former post village within the township. The Kingsland family possessed a large tract of land in the area known as Kingsland Manor. In 1872, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad established a railway through the township, and erected a depot in the area named &quot;Kingsland&quot; in honor of the family. A railroad shop was built, and houses erected for the railroad employees. Church services were held in the train depot.

===Kingsland explosion===

On January 11, 1917, a fire started in Building 30 of the Canadian Car and Foundry Company, in what is now Lyndhurst, in a plant that was producing munitions for sale to the United Kingdom and the Russian Empire during World War I. After a spill of flammable liquid started a fire in a building where shells were cleaned, about 500,000, three-inch (76 mm) explosive shells were discharged in about four hours, destroying the entire facility. It was said to have been a spectacle more magnificent than the explosion at Black Tom in Jersey City, New Jersey.

Tessie McNamara, who operated the company switchboard, was credited with saving 1,400 lives, contacting each of the buildings and shouting the warning, &quot;Get out or go up!&quot; Thanks to her dedication, no one was killed in the fire. The Lyndhurst Historical Society has created a vest pocket park dedicated to the memory of McNamara. The park is located on Clay Avenue, between Valley Brook Avenue and Wall Street West. The brick stack can be seen from this park.

The LPD was established on January 1, 1907, under the laws of Union Township. The department has lost four officers in the line of duty; which is higher than any other municipality in Bergen County.

A Police Auxiliary Unit falls under the Police Department and the Office of Emergency Management. Lyndhurst Police Auxiliary is headed by Deputy Chief Wayne Alexander. The Police Auxiliary members augment the services of the Police Department, with participants required to dedicate at least 16 hours a month for patrols on weekends, evenings and at township events and functions.

===Fire===
The Lyndhurst Fire Department (LFD) is an all-volunteer fire department. The LFD was organized in February 1886. The department is staffed by 70 fully trained firefighters and responds to an average of 600 calls per year.

===Ambulance===
The township of Lyndhurst runs both a volunteer and a paid ambulance service. Residents can use the Lyndhurst Police Emergency Squad for emergency services. The volunteers respond to medical calls from 6 pm to 6 am Monday through Friday and on a 24-hour basis on weekends, while the paid division is staffed from 6 am to 6 pm during the week. Residents do not pay for the services provided.

Route 17 and County Route 507 pass through Lyndhurst. Route 3 is just over the northern border of Lyndhurst in neighboring Rutherford. Route 21 is across the Passaic River in neighboring Nutley and Clifton.

The New Jersey Turnpike Western Spur (Interstate 95) passes through the southeastern part, but the closest interchanges are in East Rutherford (Exit 16W) and Kearny (Exit 15W).

The Avondale-DeJessa Bridge, which connects Lyndhurst and Nutley over the Passaic River with one lane in each direction, carries more than 26,000 vehicles a day, and is among 22 bridges in Bergen County that have been classified as &quot;structurally deficient&quot;.

===Public transportation===

NJ Transit has two train stations in Lyndhurst, located at Lyndhurst Station and Kingsland Station. Trains at both stations operate on the Main Line to Hoboken Terminal, with transfers available at Secaucus Junction to New York Penn Station, Newark Penn Station, and Newark Airport, with transfers at Hoboken to PATH trains, Hudson Bergen Light Rail, and New York Waterway ferries. The trains travel over the Lyndhurst Draw, a railroad bridge crossing the Passaic River between Clifton and Lyndhurst that was constructed in 1901 and is owned and operated by NJ Transit Rail Operations.

New Jersey Transit offers buses serving Newark on the 76 route and to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan on the 109, 191, 192, 193 and 195 routes.

<doc id="124989" wikidata="Q1635175" url="?curid=124989" title="Mahwah, New Jersey">
<text>Mahwah is the northernmost and largest municipality by geographic area () in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 25,487, a decrease of 403 (−1.6%) from the 2010 census count of 25,890, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,828 (+7.6%) from the 24,062 counted in the 2000 census. The name &quot;Mahwah&quot; is derived from the Lenape language word &quot;mawewi&quot; which means &quot;Meeting Place&quot; or &quot;Place Where Paths Meet&quot;.

The area that is now Mahwah was originally formed as Hohokus Township on April 9, 1849, from portions of the former Franklin Township (now Wyckoff). While known as Hohokus Township, territory was taken to form Orvil Township (on January 1, 1886; remainder of township is now Waldwick), Allendale (November 10, 1894), Upper Saddle River (November 22, 1894), and Ramsey (March 10, 1908). On November 7, 1944, the area was incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature as the Township of Mahwah, based on the results of a referendum held that day, replacing Hohokus Township. &quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine ranked Mahwah as its ninth best place to live in its 2008 rankings of the &quot;Best Places To Live&quot; in New Jersey.

== History ==
The Lenape and ancestral Indigenous peoples were the original inhabitants of Mahwah (the meeting place) and surrounding area.

In 1849, &quot;Hohokus Township&quot; was established from the northern part of Franklin Township in Bergen County. It extended from the Saddle River on the east to the western boundary of Bergen County with Passaic County and north to the New York border. Hohokus Township was first subdivided in 1886 with the creation of Orvil Township on both sides of the Saddle River, consisting of the eastern portion of Hohokus Township and the western portion of Washington Township. 1894&#x27;s outbreak of &quot;Boroughitis&quot; brought the creation of the boroughs of Allendale and Upper Saddle River, both of which were created from portions of Hohokus and Orvil Townships. Next to leave was Ramsey, which was created in 1908.

Hohokus Township ceased to exist on November 7, 1944, when a referendum was passed creating Mahwah Township from the remaining portions of Hohokus Township.

For twenty-five years, beginning in 1976, Mahwah hosted the A&amp;P Tennis Classic, a tune-up for the U.S. Open tennis tournament held at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York City&#x27;s Flushing Meadows–Corona Park.

The 75-room, three-story Crocker-McMillin Mansion, also known as Darlington, was built in 1901 for George Crocker, son of railroad magnate Charles Crocker. The estate, located at Crocker Mansion Drive, is one of New Jersey&#x27;s historical landmarks.

Ford Motor Company operated the Mahwah Assembly plant from 1955, producing 6 million cars in the 25 years it operated before the last car rolled off the line on June 20, 1980. At the time of its completion, it was the largest motor vehicle assembly plant in the United States. The Ford plant, along with other businesses such as American Brake Shoe and Foundry Company, helped contribute to the economic development of the township and its reputation for low home property taxes. The Mahwah town sports teams remain named Thunderbirds in honor of the Ford plant.

Due to contractors&#x27; dumping of hazardous wastes at the Ringwood Mines landfill site before federal regulation, it has been designated as an EPA Superfund site which needs extensive environmental cleanup. In 2006, some 600 Ramapough Indians filed a mass tort claim against Ford for damages. Mahwah, and the closure of the Ford plant, is mentioned in the opening line of the 1982 Bruce Springsteen song &quot;Johnny 99&quot;.

In July 2017, while holding the position of Bergen County prosecutor prior to becoming New Jersey Attorney General, Gurbir Grewal ordered the Mahwah police department not to enforce a ban on non-New Jersey residents using parks in Mahwah, stating his concern that a ban could lead to anti-Semitic religious profiling against the growing population of Orthodox Jews in Mahwah and those visiting from neighboring Rockland County, New York. On December 14, 2017, following the advice of legal counsel, the Mahwah council repealed the still-unenforced ban on out-of-state park users, and abandoned an attempt to amend the sign ordinance to bar &quot;other matter&quot; (the lechis) from being affixed to utility poles to form an Orthodox Jewish eruv.

== Government ==
=== Local government ===
Mahwah is governed within the Faulkner Act (formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law) under the Mayor-Council system of municipal government (Plan B), implemented by direct petition as of July 1, 1984. The township is one of 71 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. The governing body is comprised of the Mayor and the seven-member Township Council, with all members elected at-large to staggered four-year terms of office on a non-partisan basis as part of the November general election in even-numbered years. Four council seats are up for vote together and then three seats and the mayoral seat are up for vote together two years later. The legislative powers of the township are exercised by the Township Council. In September 2010, the township council voted to shift the township&#x27;s non-partisan elections from May to November, citing increased voter participation and prospective savings of $30,000 associated with supporting each election, with the first November election taking place in 2012.

, the Mayor of Mahwah is Jim Wysocki, who was elected to succeed John Roth, and whose term of office ends December 31, 2028. Roth had been elected in November 2018 following the recall of the former mayor, William Laforet. Members of the Township Council are Council President Rob Ferguson (2026), Council Vice President Michelle Paz (2028), Janet Ariemma (2026), George Ervin (2028), Ward Donigian (2026), Dave May (2028) and Jonathan Wong (2026).

Then-Mayor Bill Laforet faced a recall election in November 2018, after a resident group submitted in June a list of 5,000 petition signatures that they had collected calling for the action, in excess of the 25% needed to place the measure in front of voters. In the November 2018 general election, Laforet was recalled from office and John Roth was elected mayor. The successful recall was the first in the county for at least 25 years.

Michelle Paz, a Republican, was appointed to fill the seat expiring in December 2020 that was vacated following the resignation of Steven Sbarra that became effective at the end of December 2017, and was elected in her own right in November 2018 to fill the unexpired term.

At the January 2017 reorganization meeting, David May was sworn in to fill the seat expiring in December 2020 that had been won by Jonathan Marcus in the November 2016 general election, but which Marcus decided not to accept; May was elected in his own right in the November 2017 general election, to serve the balance of the term.

In December 2016, the Township Council selected George Ervin to fill the seat that had been held by Mary Amoroso expiring in December 2018 that became vacant after she was elected the Bergen County Board of Chosen Freeholders; Ervin served on an interim basis until the November 2017 general election, when voters elected him in his own right to fill the balance of the term. Ervin was re-elected in the November 2018 election to fill a full four-year term, expiring in 2022.

In August 1997, due to personal debt, then-Mayor David J. Dwork shot and killed himself in the town&#x27;s mayoral offices. There were also unverified allegations of corruption. Dwork was memorialized with a tree dedicated to him at the site of the Mahwah Public Library. Dwork was succeeded by Richard J. Martel, then a township council member, who served for 14 years until his own death, of natural causes, on March 7, 2011. Martel himself was succeeded by Council President John DaPuzzo as acting mayor.

== Education ==

=== Public schools ===
The Mahwah Township Public Schools provides public education for students in pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade. As of the 2019–20 school year, the district, comprised of six schools, had an enrollment of 2,913 students and 262.6 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 11.1:1. Schools in the district, with 2019–20 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics, are
Lenape Meadows Elementary School with 328 students in grades Pre-K–3,
Betsy Ross Elementary School with 241 students in grades K–3,
George Washington Elementary School with 189 students in grades K–3,
Joyce Kilmer Elementary School with 414 students in grades 4–5,
Ramapo Ridge Middle School with 685 students in grades 6–8 and
Mahwah High School with 900 students in grades 9–12.

The district&#x27;s newest building, Lenape Meadows, was opened in 2002 and changed the way the district divided up grade levels. Since the K–3 grades are broken up by location in the township which determines the elementary school to attend, before Lenape Meadows was built, students of that section of town attended Commodore Perry School. Commodore Perry School, Betsy Ross, and George Washington originally only housed the K–2 grades and the entire 3rd grade class attended Joyce Kilmer. The construction of Lenape Meadows added enough room for 3rd grade students as well, allowing Betsy Ross and George Washington room to house their students for 3rd grade, too.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Public school students from the township, and all of Bergen County, are eligible to attend the secondary education programs offered by the Bergen County Technical Schools, which include the Bergen County Academies in Hackensack, and the Bergen Tech campus in Teterboro or Paramus. The district offers programs on a shared-time or full-time basis, with admission based on a selective application process and tuition covered by the student&#x27;s home school district.

<doc id="124991" wikidata="Q1084630" url="?curid=124991" title="Midland Park, New Jersey">
<text>Midland Park is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 7,014, a decrease of 114 (−1.6%) from the 2010 census count of 7,128, which in turn reflected an increase of 181 (+2.6%) from the 6,947 counted in the 2000 census.

Midland Park was incorporated as a borough on September 6, 1894, at the height of the &quot;Boroughitis&quot; craze then sweeping through Bergen County that led to the creation of over two dozen new municipalities in the county in that one year alone. The new borough consisted of portions of both Franklin Township and Ridgewood Township. The borough expanded in April 1920 by adding another part of Franklin Township. In a referendum held on June 9, 1931, Midland Park acquired additional land from Wyckoff (which until 1926 had been known as Franklin Township). Midland Park was named after the New Jersey Midland Railway, which operated the railroad passing through the area of the borough in the 1870s, though elsewhere the name is said to be based on being situated &quot;amid Bergen hills&quot;.
==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 1.58 square miles (4.09 km2), including 1.57 square miles (4.07 km2) of land and 0.01 square miles (0.02 km2) of water (0.51%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Wortendyke.

The borough borders the Bergen County municipalities of Ridgewood, Waldwick and Wyckoff.

The borough is divided by Prospect Street, a main road running north–south through the center of the town. Prospect Street is the southernmost end of what is otherwise known as Crescent Avenue (or West Crescent Avenue), which runs through Ramsey, Allendale, and Wyckoff.

===Neighborhoods===

==Government==

===Local government===
Montvale is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Montvale is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

The mayor and council meet every second Tuesday of the month for formal public meetings and on the last Tuesday of the month for informal work sessions. Meetings are open to the public and residents are given the opportunity to speak on proposed ordinances and other matters of concern at the formal meetings. Government-access television (GATV) usually televises the first meeting of each month on the local Public-access television cable TV channel.

The mayor is the chief executive officer of the borough, and as such presides over all public meetings, provides leadership in the development of community projects and makes appointments to various boards. The borough council exercises all legislative powers including adoption of the municipal budget, bond ordinances and the general business of the community.

The council&#x27;s powers include adoption of ordinances; reviewing, revising and adopting the budget; making appropriations; levying taxes; authorizing bond issues; providing for the internal structure of local government; providing by ordinance for the creation and abolition of jobs; fixing salaries and establishing general municipal policy.

, the mayor of Montvale Borough is Republican Michael Ghassali, whose term of office ends December 31, 2023. Members of the Montvale Borough Council are Council President Douglas M. Arendacs (R, 2023), Theresa Sileo Cudequest (R, 2023; elected to serve an unexpired term), Dieter Koelling (R, 2024), Timothy E. Lane (R, 2025), Christopher A. Roche (R, 2025), and Annmarie Russo-Vogelsang (R, 2024).

In December 2021, the council appointed former councilmember Theresa Cudequest from a list of three names nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2023 that had been held by Rose Curry until she resigned from office. Cudequest served on an interim basis until the November 2022 general election, when voters chose her to serve the balance of the term of office.

<doc id="124993" wikidata="Q1089562" url="?curid=124993" title="Moonachie, New Jersey">
<text>Moonachie ( ) is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, in the Hackensack River watershed. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 3,133, an increase of 425 (+15.7%) from the 2010 census count of 2,708, which in turn reflected a decline of 46 (−1.7%) from the 2,754 counted in the 2000 census.

Tradition is that the borough was named after Monaghie, an Iroquois chief who inhabited the local cedar forests in the 1600s. Moonachie was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 11, 1910, from portions of Lodi Township, based on the results of a referendum held on May 3, 1910. On March 26, 1917, portions of Moonachie were taken to form Teterboro.

The name of the borough is pronounced &quot;moo-NAH-kee&quot;; however, in January 1987, then-mayor of New York City Ed Koch pronounced it &quot;mah-NOO-chee&quot; when he made his now-famous quip that the New York Giants should hold their victory parade in the borough after the team had just won Super Bowl XXI. Koch had refused to grant the Giants permission to hold a parade within the city limits because the team plays its home games in New Jersey, not in New York City.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 1.74 square miles (4.51 km2), including 1.73 square miles (4.48 km2) of land and 0.01 square miles (0.03 km2) of water (0.69%).

The borough is approximately northwest of downtown Manhattan in New York City. Nearby is East Rutherford, in which can be found the Meadowlands Sports Complex, home to the National Football League&#x27;s New York Giants and New York Jets, and a racetrack at which both thoroughbred horse racing and harness racing are conducted. Portions of Teterboro Airport are located in Moonachie.

<text>Norwood is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 5,641, a decrease of 70 (−1.2%) from the 2010 census count of 5,711, which in turn reflected a decline of 40 (−0.7%) from the 5,751 counted in the 2000 census.

Norwood was formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 14, 1905, from portions of Harrington Township.

==History==
The territory that became present-day Norwood was originally settled about 1686 by a dozen or more families mostly from the Dutch Republic, who purchased the land under the Tappan Patent. About that time a grant was also given by Philip Carteret, Governor of the Province of East Jersey, during the reign of King Charles II of England. The Lenape, a Native American tribe, roamed the valley.

The name Norwood emanated from the old description of its location in the &quot;North-Woods&quot;. It was a part of Harrington Township, which was formed in 1775 from the northernmost portions of Hackensack Township and New Barbadoes Township, stretching from the Hudson River in the east to the Saddle River in the west.

In 1840, the portions of Harrington Township west of the Hackensack River were taken away to create Washington Township. At that point, Harrington Township was somewhat in the form of a square measuring about on each side, bounded on the north by Rockland County, New York; east by the Hudson River, south by Hackensack Township and west by the Hackensack River. At that time, Norwood, Northvale (once called Neuvy), Old Tappan, Demarest, Closter, and Harrington Park were communities within Harrington Township.

On March 14, 1905, Norwood seceded from its parent Harrington Township and was incorporated as an independent borough.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 2.79 square miles (7.24 km2), including 2.79 square miles (7.21 km2) of land and 0.01 square miles (0.02 km2) of water (0.32%).

Norwood is in the northeastern part of New Jersey, about from the New York state line. It is bordered by the Bergen County municipalities of Alpine, Closter, Harrington Park, Northvale, Old Tappan and Rockleigh.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names within the borough include West Norwood.

* Chodae Community Church – By 2000, the congregation had grown to 700 members and the church sought approval from the borough for the construction of a $5 million, facility on a site that would include a sanctuary large enough to accommodate 720 worshipers. A local citizens group, the Norwood Civic Association was created to oppose church&#x27;s plans, with more than one-third of all resident families joining the organization, which argued that the size of the proposed church would cause flooding and cause congestion on Sundays, given the proximity between the proposed site and the borough&#x27;s athletic complex.

<text>Oakland is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey and a suburb of New York City. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 12,748, a decrease of six people from the 2010 census count of 12,754, which in turn reflected an increase of 288 (+2.3%) from the 12,466 counted in the 2000 census.

Oakland was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 8, 1902, from portions of Franklin Township (now Wyckoff). The name comes from the white oak trees in the area.

==History==
The Van Allen House was built in 1748 and was a stop for George Washington and his troops in 1777.

From the 1940s through the end of the 1960s a summer bungalow colony was developed in a valley in West Oakland on the Ramapo River. This was a refuge for a close-knit group of several score families from the summer heat of New York City and urban New Jersey. During the summer months, the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad provided service at a West Oakland passenger station. This colony was located on the road between Oakland and Pompton Lakes, near a training camp for boxers. In the early morning, a resident could see Joe Louis or Sugar Ray Robinson, among others, running past the summer homes.

One section of streets in the town are named after Native American tribes and Native American first names. Now considered politically incorrect, the borough had a wooden sign posted downtown that read &quot;Once there was Indians all over this place&quot; which had been donated by a resident who insisted on the wording of the sign as having been a quotation from an author.

==Geography==

<text>Palisades Park is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 20,292, an increase of 670 (+3.4%) from the 2010 census count of 19,622, which in turn reflected an increase of 2,549 (+14.9%) from the 17,073 counted in the 2000 census.

The borough of Palisades Park was created by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 22, 1899, from portions of Ridgefield Township. A portion of its area was annexed by the neighboring borough of Fort Lee in April 1909. The borough was named for its location atop the New Jersey Palisades.

It is one of the largest and fastest-growing ethnic Korean enclaves outside of Korea. Koreans comprise the majority (65%) of the population of the borough of Palisades Park, the municipality with the highest density of ethnic Koreans in the Western Hemisphere and the home of both the highest Korean-American density and percentage of any municipality in the United States. It has been called &quot;Koreatown on the Hudson&quot; and &quot;Little Korea&quot;. The borough&#x27;s population has grown by 40% since the 1990 census, accelerated by zoning laws that permit duplex homes on land previously containing a single-family detached home.

== Geography ==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 1.28 square miles (3.32 km2), including 1.24 square miles (3.21 km2) of land and 0.04 square miles (0.11 km2) of water (3.28%).

The borough borders Fort Lee, Leonia, Ridgefield and Ridgefield Park. Morsemere is a neighborhood largely in the northern part of Ridgefield straddling the southern border of Palisades Park.

The town&#x27;s central business district centered around Broad Avenue has been called Koreatown In mid-2015, a proposal was submitted by the Korean-American Association of Palisades Park to the mayor and council to add a second name to Broad Avenue, such as &quot;Korean Market Street&quot; (&quot;Meokjagolmok&quot;) or &quot;Korea Way&quot;.

== History ==
Until the 1980s, Palisades Park was overwhelmingly Caucasian, a mix of blue-collar workers and professionals whose families originated largely from Italy, Croatia, Germany, and Greece. Its houses were inexpensive, and it had a number of vacant shops and offices. In the 1990s, a continuous stream of Korean immigrants emerged into Palisades Park. A substantial number of affluent and educated Korean American professionals have settled in Bergen County since the early 2000s and have founded various academic and communally supportive organizations, including the Korean Parent Partnership Organization at the Bergen County Academies magnet high school and the Korean-American Association of New Jersey. Approximately 120 Korean stores were counted in Palisades Park in 2000, a number which has risen significantly since then, featuring restaurants and karaoke (&quot;noraebang&quot;) bars, grocery markets, education centers and bookstores, financial institutions, offices, electronics vendors, apparel boutiques, and other commercial enterprises.

In May 2012, borough officials rejected requests by two diplomatic delegations from Japan to remove a small monument from a public park, a brass plaque on a block of stone, dedicated in 2010 to the memory of comfort women, tens of thousands of women and girls, many Korean, who were forced into sexual slavery by Japanese soldiers during World War II. Days later, a South Korean delegation endorsed the borough&#x27;s decision. The first Japanese delegation cited apologies offered by their country&#x27;s government for its involvement as justifying the removal of the monument, while officials from the second delegation controversially claimed that &quot;comfort women were a lie&quot;. However, in neighboring Fort Lee, various Korean American groups could not reach consensus on the design and wording for such a monument as of early April 2013.

In May 2014, the Palisades Park Public Library created a memorial dedicated to the victims of the tragic sinking of the &quot;Sewol&quot; ferry off the South Korean coast on April 16, 2014.

== Government ==
=== Local government ===
Palisades Park is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The government is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Palisades Park is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

In July 2015 Gina S. Kim became the borough&#x27;s municipal clerk, reflecting the growing political influence of the Korean American population. Korean Americans, who compose more than half of the borough&#x27;s population and have attended town meetings in large numbers, have requested Korean interpreters to be present at these meetings as of August 2016. In 2017, the borough created a Korean language version of its website.

, the mayor of Palisades Park is Democrat Chong &quot;Paul&quot; Kim, whose term of office ends December 31, 2026. His predecessor, Christopher Chung, was the first Korean-American mayor in Bergen County, and second ever in New Jersey. Members of the Palisades Park Borough Council are Council President Cynthia A. Pirrera (D, 2023), Stephanie S. Jang (R, 2024), Son K. &quot;Andy&quot; Min (D, 2025), Suk Min (D, 2024; appointed to serve an unexpired term), Jae K. Park (R, 2023) and Michael P. Vietri (D, 2025).

After Chong &quot;Paul&quot; Kim took office as mayor in January 2023, the borough council declined to pick from one of the three candidates nominated by the Democratic municipal committee and chose Andy Min to fill the council seat he had held expiring in December 2024, after which the Democratic committee chose Suk Min to fill the seat. With two people chosen to fill the seat, the Democratic committee and a group of three elected officials prevailed in a suit, with a judge deciding to give the vacant seat to Suk Min.

During the 2018 primary election for mayor, former mayor James Rotundo&#x27;s mother Lorraine Rotundo went on a &quot;racist tirade&quot; on Facebook two days after the primary election. The race was extremely close with Christopher Chung winning by a narrow margin. Lorraine Rotundo made the post in response to the massive number of Koreans at the voting booths. She stated that Palisades Park should &quot;go to hell,&quot; and said that the Korean residents could &quot;have this F&#x27;n town.&quot; She later went on to post that only English should be spoken in the Borough Hall. Former mayor James Rotundo apologized on behalf of his mother and strongly denounced her comments. &quot;I&#x27;m disgusted with her statement,&quot; he said. Rotundo claimed that he was not raised by these sentiments.

Christopher Chung was sworn into office as a council member in January 2014, having been selected by the council from among three names submitted by the Democratic Municipal Committee to fill the vacant seat of Jason Kim, who had resigned earlier that month.

<doc id="124997" wikidata="Q1021714" url="?curid=124997" title="Paramus, New Jersey">
<text>Paramus ( ) is a borough in the central portion of Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. A suburban bedroom community of New York City, Paramus is located northwest of Midtown Manhattan and approximately west of Upper Manhattan. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; characterized Paramus as &quot;quintessentially suburban&quot;. The borough is also a major commercial hub for North Jersey (home to Garden State Plaza and various corporate headquarters).

As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 26,698, an increase of 356 (+1.4%) from the 2010 census count of 26,342, which in turn reflected an increase of 605 (+2.4%) from the 25,737 counted in the 2000 census.

Paramus was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 2, 1922, and ratified by a referendum held on April 4, 1922, that passed by a vote of 238 to 10. Paramus was created from portions of Midland Township, which now exists as Rochelle Park. The borough&#x27;s name is thought to have originated from the Unami language spoken by the Lenape Native Americans, derived from words meaning &quot;land of the turkeys&quot; or &quot;pleasant stream.&quot;

Paramus has some of the most restrictive blue laws in the United States, dating back to the 17th century, banning nearly all white-collar and retail businesses from opening on Sundays except for gas stations, restaurants and grocery stores, and a limited number of other businesses. Despite this, the borough is one of the largest shopping destinations in the country, generating over $6 billion in annual retail sales, more than any other ZIP Code in the United States.

==History==
===Pre-settlement===
The area that ultimately became the present-day North Jersey had been occupied for thousands of years by prehistoric indigenous peoples. At the time of European encounter, it was settled by the Lenape Native Americans. The Lenape language word for the area, &quot;Peremessing&quot;, which meant that it had an abundant population of wild turkey, was anglicized to become the word &quot;Paramus&quot;. A large metal statue of a wild turkey in the Paramus Park mall commemorates this history. Another alternative derivation is that the word means &quot;pleasant stream&quot;.

===18th century===
Albrycht Zaborowski, whose descendants became known by the family name &quot;Zabriskie&quot;, immigrated from Poland via the Dutch ship &quot;Deb Ves&quot; in 1662. He settled in the Dutch West Indies Company town of Ackensack, site of the present-day Hackensack. A son, Jacob, was captured by the Lenape and held for 15 years. When he was returned to his family, the Lenape explained to Saboroweski that they had taken the child in order to teach him their language so that he could serve as a translator. They granted Saboroweski approximately of land which became known as the &quot;Paramus Patent&quot;.

During the American Revolutionary War, the county included both Loyalists and Patriots, with Patriots &quot;greatly outnumbering&quot; Tories. Although no major battles were fought in Bergen County, Paramus was part of the military activity, as colonial troops were stationed in Ramapo under the command of Aaron Burr. In 1777, the British raided the Hackensack area and Burr marched troops to Paramus, where he attacked the British, forcing them to withdraw. General George Washington was in Paramus several times during the War: December 1778; July 1780; and, December 1780. Following the Battle of Monmouth, Washington established his headquarters in Paramus in July 1778. Over the advice of his staff, Washington moved his headquarters to Westchester County, New York.

A section of Paramus known as &quot;Dunkerhook&quot;, meaning &quot;dark corner&quot; in Dutch, was a free African-American community dating to the early 18th century. Although historical markers on the current site and local oral tradition maintain that this was a slave community, contemporary records document that it was a community of free blacks, not slaves. A group of houses built on Dunkerhook Road by the Zabriskies in the late 18th to early 19th centuries was the center of a community of black farmers, who had been slaves held by the Zabriskie family.

===20th century===
In 1909, the Arcola Country Club and golf course was created in 1909 and the neighborhood by that name grew around it. Farview Avenue, located at the highest elevation in Paramus, has a clear view of the Manhattan skyline.

Paramus became one of the truck farming areas that helped New Jersey earn its nickname as the &quot;Garden State&quot;. By 1940, Paramus&#x27; population was just 4,000, with no town center and 94 retail establishments. Although the opening of the George Washington Bridge in 1931 and the widening of Route 17 and Route 4 (which intersect in southern Paramus), made the area accessible to millions, &quot;it was not until the 1950s that massive development hit this section of northern New Jersey&quot;.

During the 1950s and 1960s, Paramus, lacking any master plan until 1969, was redeveloped into two shopping corridors when its farmers and outside developers saw that shopping malls were more lucrative than produce farming. &quot;It was a developer&#x27;s dream: flat cleared land adjacent to major arterials and accessible to a growing suburban population and the country&#x27;s largest city – with no planning restrictions&quot;. New York had a state sales tax, but New Jersey had none, so with the opening of Manhattan department stores in the Bergen Mall (1957), the Garden State Plaza (1957) and Alexander&#x27;s (1961), Paramus became the &quot;first stop outside New York City for shopping&quot;.

From 1948 to 1958, the population of Paramus nearly quadrupled, from 6,000 to 23,000, while the number of retail establishments tripled from 111 to 319, and annual retail sales increased twenty-fold in nominal dollars, from $5.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ) to $112 million (equal to $ billion in ). By the 1980s, when the population had increased slightly over 1960s levels, retail sales had climbed to $1 billion.

===21st century===
Paramus was the scene of one of the worst COVID-19 outbreaks in the U.S. when an outbreak at the New Jersey Veterans Home resulted in 74 deaths, all former soldiers through May 2020, with some 60% of the home&#x27;s 314 residents being infected.

Paramus was also the headquarters of Magic Solutions, a defunct computer software company that specialized in help desk automation and asset management software.

===Malls===

Paramus is known for its multitude of stores and malls. It has five major indoor shopping centers, serving residents in the areas of Bergen County and Passaic County in New Jersey and Rockland County in New York. New Jersey does not levy a sales tax on clothes and shoes, which makes it an attractive shopping destination for people even further away in New York City, who pay sales tax on clothing items above $110 in price, in addition to the lower standard rate of 6.625% in New Jersey, compared to 8.875% in New York City. The borough is one of the largest shopping destinations in the country, generating over $6 billion in annual retail sales, more than any other ZIP Code in the United States despite the county&#x27;s blue laws.
At the intersection of Routes 4 and 17 is Garden State Plaza, the largest and best-known mall in the borough. Westfield Garden State Plaza is the largest mall in the Westfield Group&#x27;s global portfolio and the largest in New Jersey, with a gross leasable area of . On Route 4, are Bergen Town Center (known as the Bergen Mall until 2006), Paramus Place and The Shoppes on IV. On Route 17, are Paramus Park, Paramus Towne Square, Paramus Design Center, and the Fashion Center.

Many national chain stores have at least one location in Paramus. Nordstrom&#x27;s Paramus location was its first New York–area store when it opened in September 1990, with strong sales volume. There are 25 retailers that occupy multiple stores in Paramus, including Macy&#x27;s, which had outlets in three malls for a period of time. Some retail analysts view Paramus as being two distinct markets, centered on the two major highways. Lord &amp; Taylor had locations at both Westfield Garden State Plaza and Fashion Center, giving Paramus the distinction of being the only town with more than one Lord &amp; Taylor location. However, by 2021, both locations closed, due to the company&#x27;s bankruptcy from the COVID-19 pandemic. Toys &quot;R&quot; Us had two locations: at the Fashion Center, and at a location on the eastbound side of Route 4 near Forest Avenue. Paramus also housed a Babies &quot;R&quot; Us on the northbound side of Route 17, but it closed in 2018. Later that year, the Fashion Center and Route 4 Toys &quot;R&quot; Us locations both closed due to the company&#x27;s bankruptcy. In 1983, Paramus was the location of one of the first Kids &quot;R&quot; Us stores. When Toys &quot;R&quot; Us was revived in 2019 after emerging from bankruptcy, the first new Toys &quot;R&quot; Us store opened at Garden State Plaza on November 27, 2019. However, it closed again on January 26, 2021, as a result of financial losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

====Blue laws====
In addition to the state blue laws that apply to all of Bergen County, Paramus has even stricter restrictions, preventing stores selling non-food items from opening at all on Sundays. These laws were enacted shortly after Garden State Plaza opened, out of fear that the mall would cause high levels of congestion in the borough. It is one of the last places in the United States to have such an extensive blue law. This law was called into question when a BJ&#x27;s Wholesale Club opened at the junction between Routes 4/17. BJ&#x27;s was allowed to open on Sundays, but is only allowed to sell food and basic necessities. The store has been structured to restrict access to items that cannot be purchased on Sunday.

Local blue laws in Paramus were first proposed in 1957, while the Bergen Mall and Garden State Plaza were both under construction. The legislation was motivated by fears that the two new malls would increase the already-severe highway congestion caused by local retail operations along the borough&#x27;s highways.

The Paramus Borough Code forbids the performance of any &quot;worldly employment&quot; on Sunday, with exceptions for charity, and the sale of newspapers, medicinal drugs, meals, prepared food and cigarettes, among a limited numbers of exceptions. Even work performed inside one&#x27;s own home is prohibited on Sundays. In spite of its six-day shopping week, Paramus consistently has the most retail sales of any ZIP Code in the United States.

More than 63% of Bergen County voters rejected a referendum on the ballot in 1993 that would have repealed the county&#x27;s blue laws, though the Paramus restrictions would have remained in place. An unsuccessful 2010 proposal by Governor of New Jersey Chris Christie would have ended the state&#x27;s blue laws, now only enforced in Bergen County, with the governor citing industry estimates that the $1.1 billion in added retail revenue on Sundays would generate an additional $65 million in sales taxes for the state.

In November 2012, Governor Chris Christie issued an executive order temporarily suspending the blue laws in both Bergen County and Paramus due to the effects of Hurricane Sandy, a decision that was upheld despite a court challenge by the Borough of Paramus. The blue law suspension was in effect on Sunday, November 11, but was back in effect the following Sunday.

<text>Park Ridge is a borough in Bergen County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 8,883, its highest decennial census count ever and an increase of 238 (+2.8%) from the 2010 census count of 8,645, which in turn had reflected a decline of 63 (−0.7%) from the 8,708 counted at the 2000 census. Park Ridge has continued to grow in population since the 2020 census, by 557 (+6.3%) to an estimated 9,440 residents as of 2023.

==History==
Park Ridge was created as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on May 15, 1894, from portions of Washington Township, based on the results of a referendum held the previous day. The borough was formed during the &quot;Boroughitis&quot; phenomenon then sweeping through Bergen County, in which 26 boroughs were formed in the county in 1894 alone. Park Ridge obtained a portion of River Vale (July 15, 1929), exchanged portions with Woodcliff Lake (December 12, 1955), received part of Washington Township (November 26, 1956), exchanged portions with Hillsdale (February 10, 1958) and Woodcliff Lake (June 9, 1958) and received another part of Washington Township (August 11, 1958). The borough&#x27;s name derives from its location.

Park Ridge&#x27;s Pascack Historical Society Museum, at 19 Ridge Avenue, houses the world&#x27;s only wampum drilling machine. This wooden artifact was made in Park Ridge by the Campbell Brothers who invented a way to drill through long pieces of hair pipe shells so that they could be strung and worn as breast plates by the Plains Indians, among others. Needing water for the operation, the industrious brothers leased a woolen mill that stood on the Pascack Brook. When that burned down they built their own mill farther down Pascack Creek on their land and another shop on Pascack Road near their homestead. Both buildings housed drilling machines on their second floors where they were safe from prying eyes, as the two machines had not been patented. In the early 19th century, John Jacob Astor purchased wampum from the Campbells to trade with the Native Americans of the Pacific Northwest whose beaver pelts he turned into men&#x27;s hats. The best years for the wampum business were between 1835 and 1866. The drilling machine can be seen at the Pascack Historical Society Museum on Wednesdays from 10 a.m. until noon and Sundays from 1–4 p.m. Admission is free.
