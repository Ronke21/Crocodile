<text>West Wendover is a small city in Elko County, Nevada, United States. The population was 4,512 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Elko micropolitan area. West Wendover is located on the eastern border of Nevada and the western edge of the Great Salt Lake Desert and is contiguous with Wendover, Utah, with which it is sometimes confused. It is home to five casinos and a cannabis dispensary which attract many visitors from neighboring Utah, where both casino gambling and non-medical cannabis are illegal. Interstate 80 runs just north of the cities, while Interstate 80 Business (Wendover Boulevard) runs through the two cities.

==History==

West Wendover began to develop in the 1930s and 1940s with the introduction of legalized gambling in the state of Nevada. William &quot;Bill&quot; Smith founded a small cobblestone service station for travelers crossing the desert terrain of western Utah and eastern Nevada. Today this facility is known as the Wendover Nugget. It held the record as the oldest continually operated gaming license for a casino in the State of Nevada for over 66 years, until December 2001, when the former State Line Casino and Hotel came under new ownership.

Through the 1970s and 1980s, West Wendover began to emerge as a destination resort. Additional business arrived constructing more casinos, hotels and other service establishments, as well as recreational venues, such as the Toana Vista Golf Course. As growth continued to spiral up, the citizens of West Wendover, Nevada, then a township of Elko County, elected to incorporate under self-rule. On July 1, 1991, the city of West Wendover, Nevada, came into existence. Amber S Holt named the city seal of West Wendover encouraging people to &quot;Come Grow With Us.&quot;

In October 1999, the U.S. Department of Transportation moved West Wendover out of the Pacific Time Zone due to the strong economic ties between West Wendover and neighboring Utah. This made the city of West Wendover the only portion of Nevada legally in the Mountain Time Zone. The communities of Jackpot, Jarbidge, Mountain City, and Owyhee in northern Elko County also observe Mountain Time, but only on an unofficial basis.

West Wendover has thrived under a lucrative gambling industry in Nevada, which has generated tax revenue for city services and better schools.

Residents in both cities have voted to annex Wendover into Nevada, saying they are one community that has been divided for too long. Some politicians in both the State of Utah and the State of Nevada have endorsed the idea, but the U.S. House of Representatives resolution permitting Wendover to leave Utah and join Nevada was stalled in the U.S. Senate in 2002 and did not become law. However, the politicians in Wendover, Utah, placed a permanent halt to the annexation process through a vote on November 15, 2006. The motion made was to halt the annexation process. The vote was a tie, with two Council Members voting to halt the process and two Council Members supporting the continuation of the process. The tie vote was broken up by a vote of Wendover, Utah, Mayor Brett Shelton who voted to discontinue the annexation process. Previously, West Wendover had decided to halt any further work after Wendover, Utah, indicated they were going to discuss and make a decision as to whether or not they would proceed. Article IV, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution requires that any change in state boundaries be approved by the U.S. Congress as well as by the two state legislatures.

In December 2019, West Wendover&#x27;s first recreational cannabis dispensary opened. Because non-medical cannabis is illegal in bordering Utah, the dispensary mainly serves Utah residents visiting the town.

<doc id="124429" wikidata="Q2572411" url="?curid=124429" title="McDermitt, Nevada and Oregon">
<text>McDermitt is an unincorporated community straddling the Nevada–Oregon border, in Humboldt County, Nevada, and Malheur County, Oregon, United States. McDermitt&#x27;s economy has historically been based on mining, ranching, and farming. The last mining operation closed in 1990, resulting in a steady decline in population.

As of the 2010 census, the combined population was 513. Seventy-five percent of the residents were American Indian, predominantly Northern Paiute of the Fort McDermitt Indian Reservation, whose members include Shoshone people.

==History==
The community, originally called Dugout, was named after Fort McDermit. It was named after Lt. Col. Charles McDermit, commander of the Military District of Nevada, who was killed by Native Americans in a skirmish in the area in 1865. It is not known why there is a discrepancy in the spelling. Fort McDermit, which was outside the current township, was originally established to protect the stagecoach route from Virginia City through Winnemucca to Silver City, Idaho Territory. The stage road was the military&#x27;s most important transportation route in southeast Oregon. The township of Dugout was established as support for Fort McDermit.

==Geography and climate==
The community is on U.S. Highway 95, north of Winnemucca. The elevation of McDermitt is above sea level.

McDermitt is in the Oregon High Desert with a desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;&quot;BSk&quot;&quot;), averaging of rain annually with hot, dry summers and cold winters. Most precipitation (47%) occurs from March through June. About 23% occurs from September through November, and 25% from December through February, much as snow.

The McDermitt area boasts the longest climatic record in Nevada, with data beginning in 1866. The earliest Nevada climate stations were at Army posts. The U.S. Army Signal Corps was responsible for weather duty in the late 19th century and established the National Weather Service in 1870.

==Demographics==

For statistical purposes, the census bureau has allocated McDermitt two census-designated places (CDPs), McDermitt, Nevada and Fort McDermitt, Nevada. The Oregon portion of McDermitt is not part of the McDermitt CDP, but is included in the Ontario, OR–ID Micropolitan Statistical Area.
Essentially the Fort McDermitt CDP entails the Fort McDermitt Indian Reservation and the McDermitt CDP entails the adjoining McDermitt township.

=== Fort McDermitt CDP ===
As of the US census of 2010, there were 341 people, of which 30% were under the age of 18 years and 11% (39 people) over the age of 65 years. 92% (313 people) were American Indian, with 3.5% (12 people) described as being of two or more races, and 0.6% (two people) were White. There were 125 housing units with 86% (108) described as occupied. There were 108 males for every 100 females.

In the period 1917 to 1989 it was home to four nationally significant mercury mines in the McDermitt CalderaBretz, Opalite, Cordero and McDermittwhich from 1933 to 1989 were the largest producers in North America. In 1985 of the 16,530 flasks of mercury (each containing produced in the US, 16,337 came from the McDermitt Mine. The closure of mercury mining in 1990 resulted in a significant decline in population.

Significant gold mines in the nearby Santa Rosa Mountains were the National that produced in excess of , and the Buckskin National that produced of gold and of silver over the period 1906–1941.

Current development activities that may result in renewed mining are at Cordero (gold and silver), Cordero (gallium), Buckskin-National (gold-silver), Aurora (uranium) and Disaster Peak (gold). The largest employers in McDermitt are the Say When Bar, Restaurant &amp; Casino and the McDermitt Combined School.

==Points of interest==
The state line goes through the White Horse Inn, a historical landmark now being restored, which was a saloon, hotel, and (reportedly) brothel. When it was open, food could be ordered and paid for in Oregon, avoiding the Nevada state sales tax.

==Education==
Humboldt County School District operates the McDermitt Combined School, a kindergarten–twelfth grade (K–12) school, in the Nevada side.

The Oregon side is zoned to McDermitt School District 51, a school district, governed by a board of directors, which sends all of its students to McDermitt Combined in Nevada and which does not have any employees. Circa 2006, 16 students, of all grade levels, lived in the district. In 2006 the district possessed a school building that was no longer used.

Humboldt County is in the service area of Great Basin College. That college maintains the GBC Center in Winnemucca. The section of Malheur County in which McDermitt, Oregon is located in is not in any community college district.

McDermitt has a public library, a branch of the Humboldt County Library.

<text>Winnemucca () is the only incorporated city in, and is the county seat of Humboldt County, Nevada, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city had a total population of 8,431, up 14.0 percent from the 2010 census figure of 7,396. Interstate 80 passes through the city, where it meets U.S. Route 95.

== History and culture ==
The town was named for the 19th-century Chief Winnemucca of the local Northern Paiute tribe, who traditionally lived in this area. Winnemucca, translated, means &quot;the giver.&quot; The chief&#x27;s daughter, Sarah Winnemucca, was an advocate for education and fair treatment of the Paiute and Shoshone tribes in the area. Their family all learned to speak English, and Sarah worked as an interpreter, scout and messenger for the United States Army during the Bannock War of 1878. In 1883, Sarah Winnemucca published the first autobiography written by a Native American woman, based on hundreds of lectures she&#x27;d given in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic. It has been described as &quot;one of the most enduring ethno-historical books written by an American Indian.&quot;

On September 16, 1868, the Central Pacific Railroad reached Winnemucca, and was officially opened on October 1 of that year. It was a stop on the first transcontinental railroad completed the following year.

Basque immigrants worked as sheep-herders starting in the mid-19th century. In honor of this heritage, Winnemucca hosts an annual Basque Festival.

On September 19, 1900, Butch Cassidy&#x27;s gang robbed the First National Bank of Winnemucca of $32,640.

Winnemucca&#x27;s brothel district, while smaller now than in the 1980s, is known as &quot;The Line&quot; or &quot;The Ring Circle&quot;, based on the layout of the street where the brothels are located. As of 2015, there have been no operating brothels in Humboldt County, Nevada. Sex workers in the town must register their vehicles with the local police.

According to a billboard along State Route 140 (the &quot;Winnemucca to the Sea Highway&quot;), Winnemucca styles itself &quot;The City of Paved Streets&quot;.

Winnemucca is home to the Buckaroo Hall of Fame and Heritage Museum.

===Chinatown===
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Winnemucca had a vibrant Chinatown. The Chinese originally came to the area as workers on the transcontinental Central Pacific Railroad, which reached Winnemucca in 1868. Some remained or returned to settle.

During the 1890s, around 400 Chinese formed a community in the town. Among their prominent buildings was the Joss House on Baud Street, a place of worship and celebration. In 1911, the community was visited by Sun Yat-Sen, later to become Chinese president. He was on a fund-raising tour of the United States to help the Xinhai Revolution.

The Joss House, the last structure associated with Chinatown, was demolished on March 8, 1955, by order of the Winnemucca City Council.

Over 6 million copies of the novels have been sold worldwide. A character in the series, Mother Mucca, takes her nickname from the town. The series began as a newspaper column in the &quot;Pacific Sun&quot; in 1975, before moving to the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. It features some of the first positive portrayals of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender lives. Anna Madrigal, a transgender character, was depicted as having been born as Andy Ramsey in Winnemucca, Nevada. The series was made into a TV series with the character of Anna Madrigal played by Olympia Dukakis.

In 2021, the town once again caught the attention of Armistead Maupin, after an article in the &quot;Nevada Independent News&quot; wrote about Winnemucca Pride- a planned LGBTQ pride parade and festival being planned by Winnemucca residents Shawn Dixon, Kat Dixon, Christina Basso and Misty Huff. The article prompted Maupin to write &quot;This story is inspirational on so many levels! I stand in awe of these women.&quot;

<text>Walker is a city in Cass County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 966 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Cass County.

Walker is part of the Brainerd Micropolitan Statistical Area.

Minnesota State Highways 34, 200, and 371 are three of the main routes in the city.

==History==

The area was inhabited for thousands of years by succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples. Before European settlement, the Ojibwe moved into the area from the Great Lakes, pushing out the historic Dakota peoples, such as the Assiniboine and Hidatsa. European American settlers followed the early fur traders and trappers, and encroached on Native American territories.

Following the construction of the railroad to the area, Patrick McGarry founded Walker in 1896. He named the settlement after the logging giant Thomas B. Walker, in hopes of luring construction of a sawmill. Walker instead chose to found and set up operations in nearby Akeley, because of his wife&#x27;s moral objection to the bars and brothels in Walker, a rough frontier town. Walker developed with business, jobs and other services generated by four other logging companies.

Tourism later grew as a service industry. In the 20th century, people from urban areas came to more rural areas for recreation associated with lakes, fishing, hunting and water sports. The city reached its peak of population in 1950.

In 1907, Walker became the home of the Ah-Gwah-Ching Center, first constructed as a residential facility for tuberculosis (TB) patients, who at the time could be treated only with good nutrition and rest. By 1927, it had 300 patients. The facility had its own farm and dairy herd, the patients and staff put on skits and produced a newspaper, and it had its own railroad depot at one time. During the Great Depression, it was a site for display of art produced by artists paid by the WPA, and it had the state&#x27;s largest WPA art collection. In 1962, the facility was adapted as a state nursing home for psychiatric patients. The complex is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The building was closed in 2008.

<text>Battle Mountain is an unincorporated town in, and the county seat of, Lander County, Nevada, United States. The population was 3,705 at the 2020 census. Its primary economic base is gold mining and, to a lesser extent, legalized gambling.

The town is located on Interstate 80 between Winnemucca and Elko.

==History==
The Battle Mountain area was home to the Northern Paiute and Shoshone peoples. The area was noted by fur trappers in the 1820s and &#x27;30s. It served as a waypoint for westward-bound travel on the Emigrant Trail along the Humboldt River by 1845. According to local legend, the name stems from confrontations between Native Americans and early settlers during the 1850s.

When copper ore was discovered and mining began in 1866, the Central Pacific Railroad started a station in Argenta to support the mining activity. In 1868, the railroad established the Reese River siding in Battle Mountain to support it, but in 1870, the railroad moved the Argenta station to Battle Mountain and established a townsite to serve the Battle Mountain copper and gold mining district. Two railroads headquartered there starting in 1890: the Central Nevada Railway and the Battle Mountain and Lewis Railroad. As of 2009, the railway is still in use.

In 1874, the Nevada Legislature overrode the governor&#x27;s veto and approved a railroad from Austin to Battle Mountain. The Nevada Central Railroad from Battle Mountain to Austin was completed in 1880. The rail line was constructed to connect the silver mines around Austin to the Central Pacific line at Battle Mountain. The rail line served the Austin area until it was abandoned in 1938.

Ulysses S. Grant spoke in the town in 1879 during his western speaking tour.

President Woodrow Wilson established Battle Mountain Indian Colony by executive order in 1918. In 1919, Nevada&#x27;s Red Scare Miners held a ten-day strike at the Battle Mountain Copper Mines.

On May 15, 1979, the voters of Lander County approved the move of the county seat from Austin to Battle Mountain in a special election. In a subsequent ruling, the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed this decision.

Chiefs Frank Temoke and Frank Brady refused the government&#x27;s offer of a payoff under the 1863 Treaty of Ruby Valley at Battle Mountain on December 11, 1992.

The 2008 Wells, Nevada, earthquake of 6.3 magnitude that affected the northeastern part of the state severely damaged one of the city&#x27;s oldest historical buildings, the Lemaire Building, which was condemned.

==Geography==

Battle Mountain is located at the confluence of two rivers, the Humboldt and the Reese. The town is in the Humboldt valley between the Shoshone Range to the southeast, the Battle Mountains to the southwest and the Sheep Creek Range across the Humboldt to the north.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the community has a total area of , all land.

===Geology===
Copper mining started in 1866 and the Copper Canyon Mine operated from 1917 until 1955. The Tomboy-Minnie ore deposits were developed after the depletion of the West ore body, which was developed after the depletion of the East ore body. Open-pit mining started in 1967. Placer gold was discovered in 1912. Mining switched from the copper-gold-silver ores to gold-silver ores in 1979. The Fortitude gold-silver skarn body was discovered in 1981. The Surprise gold deposit was discovered in 1986.

The economic geologic zone is primarily in the Antler Sequence, consisting of the Middle Pennsylvanian Battle Formation, the Pennsylvanian to Permian Antler Peak Limestone, and the Permian Edna Mountain Formation. These Paleozoic rocks were intruded in the Tertiary by a granodiorite porphyry which generated the ore bodies as zones of disseminated sulfide minerals. These zones include copper-gold-silver next to the granodiorite, followed by a gold-silver zone, then a lead-zinc-silver zone.

The train depot, built in 1923, is now home to some city and county offices and a museum that exhibits historical information.

<text>Dayton is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Lyon County, Nevada, United States. The population was 15,153 at the 2020 census. Dayton is the second-oldest Nevada settlement, after Genoa, and is home to the oldest hotel in the state.

==History==
Dayton is at the western end of the Twenty-Six Mile Desert at a bend in the Carson River. Immigrants stopping there for water would decide whether to follow the river south or continue west, giving the location its first name, Ponderers Rest. In 1849, Abner Blackburn, while heading for California, discovered a gold nugget in nearby Gold Creek, a tributary of the Carson River.

By 1850, placer miners settled at the mouth of Gold Cañon, working sand bars deposited over the millennia along the path of the creek. At first the settlement was just called &quot;Gold Cañon&quot; or &quot;Gold Cañon Flat&quot;. Throughout the 1850s, Dayton served as the commercial hub for miners working in the canyon. In 1857 many Chinese miners came to the area to avoid mining taxes directed at the Chinese in California. With the 1859 discovery of the Comstock Lode, newly founded Gold Hill and Virginia City, to the north, assumed prominence and most miners headed up the cañon. By 1860 the town was primarily occupied by Chinese miners and it was called &quot;China Town&quot; in the U.S. census of that year. However, soon people began to realize there was more profit in providing milling, goods, and services to the miners and thus came or returned to the area.
In 1861, the town officially adopted the name &quot;Dayton&quot;, after John Day, a local surveyor who was later elected Surveyor General of Nevada in 1868, 1870, and 1874. On November 29, 1861, Dayton became the governmental seat for Lyon County. Because of the availability of water from the Carson River, it soon became the first major milling center of the Comstock, and grew rapidly—from 78 residents in 1860 to 2,500 in 1865. Its 1864 courthouse was one of the first in Nevada. 
In 1866 and 1870 devastating &quot;Great Fires&quot; in Dayton greatly reduced the size of the town. The 1869 opening of the Virginia and Truckee Railroad shifted ore processing upstream to the Carson River Canyon, but Dayton continued to serve as a lesser center of commerce and government. Nonetheless, in the 1870s it was a much quieter, less prosperous town. The coming of the Carson &amp; Colorado Railroad in 1881 brought back some prosperity to Dayton, but the population nonetheless hovered around 500 residents until after World War I.
In 1909, fire destroyed the Lyon County Courthouse. Residents of the growing agricultural community of Yerington to the south called for a shift of the Lyon County seat, which occurred in 1911, leaving Dayton with a shrinking economy and population. By the 1920s, the Lincoln Highway was bringing some tourists to Dayton, but the town remained a quiet reminder of a time when Nevada&#x27;s gold and silver strikes captured national attention. It did not surpass its 1865 peak population of 2,500 until 1930.
In 1961, Dayton won fame as a setting for John Huston&#x27;s film, &quot;The Misfits&quot;, the last movie appearances of Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe. Beginning in the 1990s, Dayton experienced phenomenal growth as residential development expanded on the east side of the Carson River. The historic part of Dayton is within the Comstock Historic District, featuring a small but impressive main street, the monumental Odeon Hall, and a charming local museum located in an 1865 schoolhouse that is the oldest in Nevada in its original location.
Dayton claims the designation of Nevada&#x27;s oldest settlement, a title disputed by the residents of Genoa. Dayton points to the fact that when the wagon train of pioneer Lucena Parsons stayed at the mouth of Gold Cañon (now Dayton) for several weeks waiting for the snow to leave the Sierra Nevada, she recorded in her journal that Colonel Reese and his party passed along the Carson River as they headed for the Sierra foothills to establish Mormon Station (today&#x27;s Genoa). She had noted also that upon the wagon train&#x27;s arrival about three weeks earlier, more than 200 miners were working the cañon. Today&#x27;s residents of Genoa point to the region&#x27;s first post office and several other aspects of town government and note that their community deserves the title of &quot;Nevada&#x27;s first town,&quot; a claim that Dayton residents do not care enough to dispute.

Dayton is listed as Nevada Historical Marker 7.

<text>Fernley is a city in Lyon County, Nevada, United States, and part of the Reno–Tahoe–Sparks metropolitan area CSA. The city was incorporated in 2001. The population of the city was 22,895 at the 2020 census, making it the 7th most populous city in Nevada.

Fernley was home to the historic and one of the first Amazon.com centers in the world, which has since relocated within the metro area. Naval Air Station (TOPGUN), the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center &amp; TOPGUN training program since 1996, was moved nearby, to Fallon, from Naval Air Station Miramar. The city is home to the Reno-Fernley Raceway. The world&#x27;s first Tesla Gigafactory 1 that produces battery packs, energy storage and electric vehicle components is nearby 15 miles west at the Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, and also there as of 2024 an under-construction lithium processing plant.

==History==

Fernley, established in 1904, developed as primarily an agricultural and ranching community in proximity to Reno. It is unknown why the name &quot;Fernley&quot; was applied to this community. It, along with the defunct settlement of Fernley, California are the only two known places in the world to have the name Fernley.

Much of the farmland in the Fernley area was developed through the Newlands Irrigation Project, which was a result of the Newlands Reclamation Act of 1902. The project established an irrigation system that delivers water to an area stretching from Derby Dam, along the Truckee River, to the Lahontan Reservoir near Fallon, Nevada. Construction and expansion of the system took place from the inception through the 1960s. Many of the concrete irrigation headgates, still in use today, are embossed with the CCC (Civilian Conservation Corps) stamp and date of construction. In addition to the irrigation system in the Fernley area, a drainage system was also constructed to carry away excess water and mineral salts from the farmlands. This system consists of channels ( deep) dug adjacent to fields; it eventually terminates in the sink northeast of Fernley. The irrigation system is administered and maintained through the Truckee–Carson Irrigation District.

The Southern Pacific Railroad completed the Fernley and Lassen Railway in 1914. The transcontinental Lincoln/Victory Highways was built through town in the 1920s.

In 1965, the Nevada Cement Company started operation in a new plant built on the north side of the city between Fernley and Wadsworth. This was the first significant non-agricultural/ranching business to come to Fernley, aside from the railroad. Primary employment in Fernley began a steady transition to an industrial and commuter base. Beginning in the 1970s, parts of the formerly agricultural and ranching-based lands were transitioning to housing subdivisions to support the growing population, much of which was spilling over from rapid growth in the Reno-Sparks area. Close proximity to Interstate 80 and abundant land for housing made Fernley an attractive alternative to the increasingly congested and expensive Truckee Meadows housing market. Beginning near the established parts of the town, growth moved to the Fremont Street area in the mid to late 1970s, nearer farming areas in the 1980s, and has continued along the Farm District Road areas to the present. Numerous subdivisions were built along the Farm District Road, including an 18-hole golf course and a new elementary school.

In 1999, Amazon.com opened a order fulfillment center in the industrial park located in the northeast side of the city, following major initiatives and investments by investors from Seattle. Stanley Works had previously used the facility; Amazon.com moved west to Reno, NV and has redesigned the interior systems and greatly expanded the capacity in the years since. The investment has provided thousands of new jobs for the city and invigorated the economy in the metropolitan area. Since that time, more companies have opened facilities in the park, including Trex Inc., Allied Signal, UPS Worldwide Logistics (Honeywell), ARE Campers, Johns Manville. Sherwin Williams Paint and the newly constructed Polaris are part of the newer industrial area on the north east side of town, with more companies interested in relocating to the area.

On July 1, 2001, the city of Fernley was incorporated. Fernley was one of the worst hit towns in the Great Recession.

On January 5, 2008, a levee along the Truckee Canal broke, forcing the rescue and evacuation of 3,500 people from the town as of water filled houses. A 2021 lawsuit seeks to block the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation from lining the bottom of the Truckee Canal with concrete, on the grounds that Fernley&#x27;s municipal water supply depends on seepage from the canal for groundwater recharge.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Smith Valley CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.57%, are water. The central part of the valley is drained by the West Walker River, which exits the valley to the east through Wilson Canyon. The northern part of the valley is an endorheic basin, with Artesia Lake occupying the lowest area.

Smith Valley is named for American fur trapper and explorer Jedediah Smith, who crossed the area in spring 1827, after crossing the Sierra Nevada at Ebbetts Pass on his way to the 1827 fur trade rendezvous.

Wovoka, also known as Jack Wilson, a Northern Paiute religious leader who founded the Ghost Dance movement of 1890, was born and raised in Smith Valley.

== Water use and shortages ==
The West Walker River flows through Smith Valley, and for more than a century the flows of the Walker have been diverted to irrigate farms and ranches. Diversions of the Walker River have contributed to near complete ecosystem collapse of Walker Lake. The primary crops grown in Smith Valley are alfalfa and hay.

In addition to the use of surface water that has led to the ecological collapse of Walker Lake, Smith Valley water users have withdrawn groundwater at an unsustainable rate for at least 50 years. In 2015, the Nevada Department of Water Resources issues Order 1267, limiting the use of supplemental groundwater in Smith and Mason Valleys. The order was subsequently struck down by state district court, as the order&#x27;s 50% curtailment of all supplemental groundwater rights was found to abridge the priority dates of some supplemental groundwater right owners. In 2022, a study by the Nevada Department of Water Resources indicated that the groundwater table in Smith Valley has declined by more than in the last 50 years and that more than of groundwater have been withdrawn from the valley. During the same time period, the Walker River through Smith Valley has significantly declined in stream efficiency, suggesting that groundwater pumping is leading to more river water leaving the channel to the groundwater table each year.

<text>Yerington is a city in Lyon County, Nevada, United States. The population was 3,048 at the 2010 census. It is the current county seat of Lyon County, with the first county seat having been established at Dayton on November 29, 1861. It is named after Henry M. Yerington, superintendent of the Virginia and Truckee Railroad from 1868 to 1910.

==History==

===Native people===
The Yerington Paiute Tribe of the Yerington Colony and Campbell Ranch is headquartered in Yerington. The people, known as &quot;Numu&quot; (human beings) in their own language, have lived in the Smith and Mason Valleys in Northwestern Nevada, since around 1000 A.D.

===City===
The community was formerly named Greenfield, Mason Valley, and Pizen Switch (irreverent nickname from the time where Yerington was a transfer - or switch - stop; and the local whiskey was so bad that it was called &quot;poison&quot;. &quot;Poison&quot; came out sounding like &quot;pizen&quot; because of local vernacular, and the name &quot;Pizen Switch&quot; stuck.)

It was founded on August 6, 1871. The city was incorporated on March 17, 1907.

After the Dayton Court House burned down in 1909, the county seat was moved to Yerington in 1911.

===Wilson Ranch fire balloon===
During World War II, one of many Japanese Fu-Go balloon bombs launched at the United States landed on the Wilson Ranch near Yerington. The ranchers, not knowing what it was, attempted to notify the authorities by mail, but did not receive a response until after they cut it up and used it as a hay tarp.

==Geography==
Yerington is located at the intersection of US 95A and Nevada State Route 208. It is south of Silver Springs and U.S. Route 50, 47 miles (76 km) south of Fernley and Interstate 80, west of Schurz and U.S. Route 95, and northeast of Smith Valley.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The Walker River is formed in southern Lyon County, south of Yerington, by the confluence of the East Walker and West Walker rivers. It flows into the Mason Valley where Yerington is located, and is used for irrigation.

===Climate===
Yerington experiences a borderline cool desert climate (Köppen &quot;BWk&quot;)/cool semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;). Yerington is noticeably more arid than areas even marginally closer to the Sierra Nevada – it receives only half as much precipitation as Carson City, a third as much as South Lake Tahoe and only one-eighth as much as Nevada City, California on the western Sierra slopes. Because the drying effect of the Pine Nut Mountains is most pronounced in the winter, Yerington receives very little snow in most years, although in the very cold and snowy month of January 1916 as much as fell and that season saw a total of . January 2017 proved the first month to exceed of precipitation when it totaled . The wettest &quot;rain year&quot; has been from July 1955 to June 1956 with and the driest from July 1949 to June 1950 with only , although the calendar year of 1983 saw . The most precipitation in one day is on September 18, 1955, closely rivaled by December 23 of that year when fell.

During the summer, temperatures are generally hot to very hot in the afternoon, but the high altitude and low humidity means temperature drop to a comfortable level at night. On average, 8.0 afternoons each summer will exceed and 73.2 afternoons reach . It is rare, though, that minima stay above , although thirteen mornings stayed this warm in 2015. The hottest minimum has been on July 22, 2003, and the hottest temperature on July 15, 2014. In the winter, afternoons are sunny and cool to cold with all but 4.6 topping freezing on average, although mornings typically range from freezing to frigid: 135.5 mornings fall below freezing in an average year and 0.6 fall to or below . The coldest temperature on record is on January 21, 1937, and the coldest month January 1949 which averaged with a mean minimum of . The coldest afternoon is , which occurred on February 6, 1989, and December 22, 1990.

The first permanent settlement at Hawthorne was established in 1880.

The townsite was selected in 1880 by H. M. Yerington, president of the Carson and Colorado Railroad Co. as a division and distribution site for the new railroad.

The location was adjacent to the important Knapp&#x27;s Station and Ferry Landing on the busy Esmeralda Toll Road from Wadsworth to Candelaria. Connecting roads were built to all of the surrounding mining areas.

H. M. Yerington named the new town &quot;Hawthorne&quot; after a lumberman, rancher, and law enforcement friend he knew in Carson City. The first train arrived on April 14, 1881, loaded with prospective buyers for the new town lots.

In 1883, Hawthorne took the Esmeralda County seat from declining Aurora but later lost it to booming Goldfield. In 1911, it again became a county seat, this time for the new Mineral County.

<text>Beatty ( ) is an unincorporated town along the Amargosa River in Nye County, Nevada, United States. U.S. Route 95 runs through the town, which lies between Tonopah, about to the north and Las Vegas, about to the southeast. State Route 374 connects Beatty to Death Valley National Park, about to the west.

Before the arrival of non-indigenous people in the 19th century, the region was home to groups of Western Shoshone. Established in 1905, the community was named after Montillus (Montillion) Murray &quot;Old Man&quot; Beatty, who settled on a ranch in the Oasis Valley in 1896 and became Beatty&#x27;s first postmaster. With the arrival of the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad in 1905, the town became a railway center for the Bullfrog Mining District, including mining towns such as nearby Rhyolite. Starting in the 1940s, Nellis Air Force Base and other federal installations contributed to the town&#x27;s economy as did tourism related to Death Valley National Park and the rise of Las Vegas as an entertainment center.

Beatty is home to the Beatty Museum and Historical Society and to businesses catering to tourist travel. The ghost town of Rhyolite and the Goldwell Open Air Museum (a sculpture park), are both about to the west, and Yucca Mountain and the Nevada Test Site are about to the east.

==History==
Before the arrival of non-indigenous explorers, prospectors, and settlers, Western Shoshone in the Beatty area hunted game and gathered wild plants in the region. It is estimated that the 19th-century population density of the Indians near Beatty was one person per . By the middle of the century, European diseases had greatly reduced the Indian population, and incursions by newcomers had disrupted the native traditions. In about 1875, the Shoshone had six camps, with a total population of 29, along the Amargosa River near Beatty. Some of the survivors and their descendants continued to live in or near Beatty, while others moved to reservations at Walker Lake, Reese River, Duckwater, or elsewhere.

Beatty is named after &quot;Old Man&quot; Montillus (Montillion) Murray Beatty, a Civil War veteran and miner who bought a ranch along the Amargosa River just north of the future community and became its first postmaster in 1905. The community was laid out in 1904 or 1905 after Ernest Alexander &quot;Bob&quot; Montgomery, owner of the Montgomery Shoshone Mine near Rhyolite, decided to build the Montgomery Hotel in Beatty. Montgomery was drawn to the area, known as the Bullfrog Mining District, because of a gold rush that began in 1904 in the Bullfrog Hills west of Beatty.

During Beatty&#x27;s first year, wagons pulled by teams of horses or mules hauled freight between the Bullfrog district (that included the towns of Rhyolite, Bullfrog, Gold Center, Transvaal, and Springdale) and the nearest railroad, in Las Vegas, and by the middle of 1905, about 1,500 horses were engaged in this business. In October 1906, the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad (LV&amp;T) began regular service to Beatty; in April 1907, the Bullfrog Goldfield Railroad (BG) reached the community, and the Tonopah and Tidewater (T&amp;T) line added a third railroad in October 1907. The LV&amp;T ceased operations in 1918, the BG in 1928, and the T&amp;T in 1940. Until the railroads abandoned their lines, Beatty served as the railhead for many mines in the area, including a fluorspar mine on Bare Mountain, to the east.

Beatty&#x27;s first newspaper was the &quot;Beatty Bullfrog Miner&quot;, which began publishing in 1905 and went out of business in 1909. The &quot;Rhyolite Herald&quot; was the region&#x27;s most important paper, starting in 1905 and reaching a circulation of 10,000 by 1909. It ceased publication in 1912, and the Beatty area had no newspaper from then until 1947. The &quot;Beatty Bulletin&quot;, a supplement to the &quot;Goldfield News&quot;, was published from then through 1956.

Beatty&#x27;s population grew slowly in the first half of the 20th century, rising from 169 in 1929 to 485 in 1950. The first reliable electric company in the community, Amargosa Power Company, began supplying electricity in about 1940. Phone service arrived during World War II, and the town installed a community-wide sewer system in the 1970s. When a new mine opened west of Beatty in 1988, the population briefly surged from about 1,000 to between 1,500 and 2,000 by the end of 1990. Since the mine&#x27;s closing in 1998, the population has fallen again to near its former level.

==Economy==
 Early businesses in Beatty included the Montgomery Hotel, built by a mine owner in 1905, and freight businesses first centered on horse-drawn wagons and later on railroads serving the mining towns in the Bullfrog district. Beatty became the economic center for a large sparsely populated region. Aside from mining, other activities sustaining the community during the 1920s and 1930s included retail sales, gas and oil distribution, construction of Scotty&#x27;s Castle, and the production and sale of illegal alcohol during Prohibition.

Nevada&#x27;s legalization of gambling in 1931, the establishment of Death Valley National Monument in 1933, and the rise of Las Vegas as an entertainment center, brought visitors to Beatty, which became increasingly tourist-oriented.

As underground mining declined in the region, federal defense spending, starting with the Nellis Air Force Range in 1940 and the Nevada Test Site in 1950, also contributed to the local economy. However, in 1988, an open-pit mine and mill began operations about west of Beatty along State Route 374. Barrick Gold acquired the mine in 1994 and continued to extract and process ore at what became known as the Barrick Bullfrog Mine. At its peak, the mine employed 540 workers, many of whom lived in Beatty. The mine closed in 1998.

In 2004, the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) named the closed Barrick Bullfrog mine site as one of six slated for pilot reclamation projects under the national Brownfields Mine-Scarred Land Initiative. A local group, the Beatty Economic Development Corporation (BEDC), in discussions with the EPA, suggested solar-power generation as a potential use for the site. Barrick Gold later transferred of its land to Beatty. In February 2009, the &quot;New York Times&quot; published a Greenwire article suggesting that part of the economic stimulus money from the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act might finance the Beatty project. &quot;Studies show that the Beatty area has some of the best solar energy potential in the United States, as well as a high potential for wind-power generation,&quot; the Greenwire story said.

The Beatty Chamber of Commerce web site describes the community as the &quot;Gateway to Death Valley&quot;, a small rural locality that has &quot;everything the desert visitor needs&quot; including motels and recreational vehicle (RV) sites. Aside from tourism, businesses contributing to the local economy include mining, retail trade, public administration and gambling.

==Burro races==

From 1961 until 1972 the local Lions Club held annual burro races that drew competitors from the United States, Canada, and as far away as Iran. National attention was brought to the race when Reg Potterton wrote a feature article about the 1971 race for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. The story, appearing in the May 1972 issue, featured stories about the town, the contestants, and the tourists who attended. Eventually the races were discontinued after organizers decided that the visitors they attracted were not good for Beatty&#x27;s image.

==Infrastructure and culture==
 The community is home to the Beatty Museum and Historical Society. The ghost town of Rhyolite and the Goldwell Open Air Museum, a sculpture park, are about to the west. Bailey&#x27;s Hot Springs and bathhouses are about north of Beatty in the Oasis Valley. In addition to highways, Beatty has a general aviation airfield, Beatty Airport, about south of downtown. Beatty Medical Center, which opened in 1977, provides family medicine and other services. The Beatty Library is the only library in Nevada that is housed in a geodesic dome. Beatty&#x27;s combined elementary and middle schools, serving kindergarten through eighth grade, and Beatty High School, grades 9–12, are part of the Nye County School District. The Beatty Water and Sanitation District supplies drinking water from three wells to the town residents and treats the community&#x27;s wastewater.

<text>Gabbs is an unincorporated town in Nye County, Nevada, United States. The population was 269 at the 2010 census. Located in northern Nye County, it is part of the Las Vegas–Henderson, NV CSA (Combined Statistical Area), making it at the most distant community from Las Vegas in the Las Vegas–Henderson combined statistical area.

==History==
Gabbs was founded &quot;circa&quot; December 1941 as a company town for Basic Magnesium, Inc. (BMI), which operated a magnesium production plant in the area. The town grew out of an earlier mining camp named Brucite (after the magnesium oxide brucite that occurred locally), and took the name of the surrounding Gabbs Valley, itself named after paleontologist William Gabb (who had studied fossil specimens from the area). World War II demand for magnesium fuelled the plant&#x27;s expansion under the direction of the War Production Board, and policing, a jail, and a school district were established during 1942. Gabbs became a township in June 1943, with a population of 426. Settlements at North Gabbs, South Gabbs, and Tent City (which later largely merged into North Gabbs) were served by a library, city hall, parks, and tennis courts, and a succession of local newspapers. The city incorporated on March 29, 1955.
In September 1944 the original magnesium plant was closed, having produced enough ore to meet targets for the projected duration of the war. The local population initially fell, but revived when a new plant administered by Basic Refractories, Inc., producing magnesium for the private sector, was opened in 1955. The town&#x27;s population climbed to 796 by 1960.

In 1982 BRI laid off half its 350 workers, prompting the town&#x27;s population to decline once more. An influx of workers to a gold mine in nearby Paradise Peak briefly expanded the population again during the 1980s and 1990s, but this plant too closed in 1994, and in 2001 Gabbs lost its incorporated status. Today the town retains a high school, stores, and homes.

<text>Tonopah ( , Shoshoni language: Tonampaa) is an unincorporated town in and the county seat of Nye County, Nevada, United States. Nicknamed the Queen of the Silver Camps for its mining-rich history, it is now primarily a tourism-based resort city, notable for attractions like the Mizpah Hotel and the Clown Motel.

Tonopah is located at the junction of U.S. Routes 6 and 95, approximately midway between Las Vegas and Reno. In the 2010 census, the population was 2,478. The census-designated place (CDP) of Tonopah has a total area of , all land.

==History==

The American community began circa 1900 with the discovery of silver-rich ore by prospector Jim Butler. The legendary tale of discovery says that he went looking for a burro that had wandered off during the night and sought shelter near a rock outcropping. When Butler discovered the animal the next morning, he picked up a rock to throw at it in frustration, noticing that the rock was unusually heavy. He had stumbled upon the second-richest silver strike in Nevada history. However, this commonly-told story is likely apocryphal. Butler was married to a local Paiute woman named Belle—her family guided Butler to the area long known by indigenous peoples for its surface minerals.

Men of wealth and power entered the region to consolidate the mines and reinvest their profits into the infrastructure of the town of Tonopah. George Wingfield, a 24-year-old poker player when he arrived in Tonopah, played poker and dealt faro in the town saloons. Once he had a small bankroll, he talked Jack Carey, owner of the Tonopah Club, into taking him in as a partner and filing for a gaming license. In 1903, miners rioted against Chinese workers in Tonopah. This resulted in China enforcing a boycott in China of U.S. imported goods.

By 1904, after investing his winnings in the Boston-Tonopah Mining Company, Wingfield was worth $2 million. When old friend George S. Nixon, a banker, arrived in town, Wingfield invested in his Nye County Bank. They grub-staked (provided with food, supplies and tools in an exchange for a percentage of mine yield) miners with friend Nick Abelman, and bought existing mines. By the time the partners moved to Goldfield, Nevada and made their Goldfield Consolidated Mining Company a public corporation in 1906, Nixon and Wingfield were worth more than $30 million.

Wingfield believed that the end of the gold and silver mining production was coming and took his bankroll to Reno, where he invested heavily in real estate and casinos. Real estate and gaming became big business throughout Central Nevada. By 1910, gold production was falling, and by 1920, the town of Tonopah had less than half the population it had fifteen years earlier.

Small mining ventures continued to provide income for local miners and the small town struggled on. Located about halfway between Reno and Las Vegas, it has supported travelers as a stopover and rest spot on a lonely highway. Today the Tonopah Station has slots and the Banc Club also offers some gaming.

Also in Nye County is the Yomba Band of the Yomba Shoshone Tribe of the Yomba Reservation, a federally recognized band of Western Shoshone people. The Western Shoshone dominated most of Nevada at the time of American settlement in the 1860s.

Since the late 20th century, Tonopah has relied on the nearby military Tonopah Test Range as its main source of employment. The military has used the range and surrounding areas as a nuclear bomb test site, a bombing range, and a base of operations for the development of the F-117 Nighthawk.

In 2014, California-based solar energy company SolarReserve completed construction on a $980 million advanced solar energy project near Tonopah. The Crescent Dunes Solar Energy Project uses liquid sodium as a heat transfer medium for its solar energy storage technology. The plant began producing power in November 2015.

On May 15, 2020, a magnitude 6.5 earthquake struck west of Tonopah, followed by a series of aftershocks, the largest of which was a magnitude 5.1. However, no injuries were reported. It was the largest earthquake in Nevada since 1954.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The founder, Jim Butler, named the settlement from what is thought to be a Shoshoni language word, pronounced &quot;TOE-nuh-pah.&quot; Although the town previously had a variety of names, including Butler City, Jim Butler&#x27;s name has survived. According to local history, the name is said to mean &quot;hidden spring&quot;.

Linguistically, the name derives from either Shoshone &quot;to-nuv&quot; (greasewood), or Northern Paiute &quot;to-nav&quot; (greasewood), and &quot;pa,&quot; meaning water in both dialects.

==Climate==

==Transportation==
During the silver bonanza of the first decade of the 20th century, the need in the precious-metal fields for freight service led to construction of a network of local railroad lines across the Nevada desert to Tonopah. Examples include the Las Vegas and Tonopah Railroad, the Tonopah and Goldfield Railroad, and the Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad. Coal was hauled to the silver mines to power mine operations and also the stamp mills built in and around Tonopah to break apart the hard-rock ore for milling and refining.

As the railroad lines were reduced with the decline of mining and restructuring of railroads in the late 20th century, 18-wheelers became the dominant method of moving freight. Tonopah took on a new identity as an extreme freight destination. The chorus of the song &quot;Willin&#x27;&quot; by Lowell George of Little Feat on the albums &quot;Little Feat&quot;, &quot;Sailin&#x27; Shoes&quot;, and &quot;Waiting for Columbus&quot; refers to Tonopah, Nevada:

In the early 21st century, Tonopah is served by two U.S. Highways, Routes 6 and 95. There is no rail service. General aviation facilities are located at nearby Tonopah Airport. The nearest airport with scheduled passenger service is Mammoth Yosemite Airport, about away. The nearest major airports are Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, and Reno–Tahoe International Airport in Reno, each more than away.

Daily bus service between Las Vegas, Tonopah, and Reno is provided by Salt Lake Express.

<doc id="124454" wikidata="Q652027" url="?curid=124454" title="Lovelock, Nevada">
<text>Lovelock is the county seat of Pershing County, Nevada, United States, in which it is the only incorporated city.

It is the namesake of a nearby medium-security men&#x27;s prison and a Cold War-era gunnery range.

Formerly a stop for settlers on their way to California and later a train depot, the town&#x27;s economy remains based on farming, mining and increasingly on tourism.

==History==
The area in which the township of Lovelock was to be established first came to prominence as a midpoint on the Humboldt Trail to California. According to an 1849 description of what were then called the Big Meadows, &quot;This marsh for three miles is certainly the liveliest place that one could witness in a lifetime. There is some two hundred and fifty wagons here all the time. Trains going out and others coming in and taking their places is the constant order of the day. Cattle and mules by the hundreds are surrounding us, in grass to their knees, all discoursing sweet music with the grinding of their jaws.”

A few settlers stopped there to harvest the wild rye growing in the meadows and scythe the hay each fall, which they sold. Arriving there from California in 1866, the English settler George Lovelock (1824–1907) bought the squatters&#x27; right for and received with it the oldest water rights on the Humboldt River.

Although born in Wales, Lovelock was from an English family of Wiltshire origin that is known to family historians as the Lyneham Line. His brother Daniel moved to Australia—and one of Daniel&#x27;s sons to New Zealand—so that the relations of the man after whom the Nevada town was named are now widely scattered.

The town&#x27;s foundation came about with the building of the Central Pacific Railroad through the area in August 1868. George Lovelock provided for the site, so the depot was named &#x27;Lovelock&#x27;s&#x27; after him and appears as such on old maps.

Thereafter he put his mining expertise to work and discovered many valuable lodes in the surrounding area, which contributed to increased railway traffic. He also acted as the town&#x27;s first postmaster and invested in hotels. In particular, he was the first proprietor of the Big Meadows Hotel on Main Street, adjacent to the train station. That was eventually adapted as the Greyhound Bus depot.

By 1900, the town of Lovelock had a school, churches and a business district along what was then called Railway Street—later renamed West Broadway. Also included among the businesses were three weekly newspapers: The &quot;Lovelock Tribune&quot;, which ran from May 1898 until February 1912; the short-lived &quot;Lovelock Standard&quot; (April–September 1900); and &quot;The Argus&quot; (May 1900-Jan 1905). In August 1908 the weekly &quot;Lovelock Review&quot; was founded, becoming &quot;Lovelock Review-Miner&quot; in January 1911 and remaining under that name to the present day.

Lovelock was incorporated as a city in 1917. In 1919 it was named the county seat when Pershing County was organized, carved out of the southern part of Humboldt County. Its famous round Court House was built at the end of Main Street, on the former site of a school that had been relocated.

While mining and agriculture were the base of the economy, the community thrived on the state specialty of gambling. It had many casinos and three legalized brothels; all of the latter are now closed.

The town&#x27;s centenary was celebrated in 1968 with a Frontier Days theme suggested by two of the founder&#x27;s great-great granddaughters, Elaine Pommerening and Pat Rowe, who had recently moved back to Lovelock. This was part of the more recent emphasis on heritage tourism.

In 1983, old U.S. Route 40 through downtown was bypassed by Interstate 80, which pulled business from the center. In the early 1990s the rail depot closed. Since then, the city has promoted its heritage tourist attractions, emphasizing its historic buildings and organizing special events.

Several mining booms have taken place in the neighboring mountains. These included intensive activity in the Rochester and Seven Troughs areas at the start of the 20th century, and subsequent drilling with more advanced techniques later in Rochester. The Coeur Rochester mine began further open cast mining for silver and gold in 2011. Test drilling for gold continues at Relief Canyon, and diatomite is dug at the Colado Mine.

==Geography==
Lovelock lies in the Humboldt River Basin, very near the terminus of the river. Some 20 miles outside the town is the Lovelock Native Cave, a horseshoe-shaped cave of about and where Northern Paiute natives anciently deposited a number of duck decoys and other artifacts.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. It has four differently designed welcome signs with pioneer and Wild West themes placed on its approach roads. At the southern end of town is the 20-acre reservation of the Lovelock Paiute Tribe, which has recently profited from a change in state law to open a marijuana dispensary there.

===Climate===

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Lovelock has a cold desert climate, abbreviated &quot;BWk&quot; on climate maps. The hottest temperature recorded in Lovelock was on July 5, 2007, while the coldest temperature recorded was on January 25, 1949.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2000, there were 2,003 people, 778 households, and 493 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 951 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 76.49% White, 0.80% African American, 7.14% Native American, 0.70% Asian, 0.20% Pacific Islander, 10.03% from other races, and 4.64% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 24.21% of the population.

There were 778 households, out of which 33.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 47.8% were married couples living together, 9.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 36.6% were non-families. 31.5% of all households were made up of individuals, and 12.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.52 and the average family size was 3.22.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 31.2% under the age of 18, 7.5% from 18 to 24, 27.2% from 25 to 44, 20.9% from 45 to 64, and 13.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 107.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 105.2 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $39,563, and the median income for a family was $44,885. Males had a median income of $38,658 versus $20,371 for females. The per capita income for the city was $17,233. About 9.6% of families and 19.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 18.9% of those under age 18 and 19.3% of those age 65 or over. The majority rely on agriculture and mining for their income.

==Economy==
===Tourism===
Among the tourist events figure the I.D.E.S. Portuguese festival in May and what became the annual Frontier Days weekend in July. There are also hot air balloon races (Lovers Aloft, inaugurated in February 2004) and the Lovelock Street Fever car show, begun in June 2007. A major draw is the Lovers Lock Plaza in the shaded area at the back of the Court House where couples symbolise their love by attaching a padlock to an &#x27;endless chain&#x27;, a practice begun on Valentine&#x27;s Day, 2005. The following year saw the construction of a dirt-racing track known as the Lovelock Speedway.

Lovelock&#x27;s heritage buildings include the wooden built Grace Methodist Church on the corner of Cornell Avenue and 8th Street, dating from 1886. It was destroyed by fire in 1922 and the tower was rebuilt without the original spire; in 1983 the church was badly damaged by another fire and was restored again. Marzen House Museum is another Victorian building, built in 1874. The Italianate farmhouse was transported from Big Meadow Ranch in the 1980s and has on its site an assay office, farm machinery sheds, and buildings housing vintage automobiles, while inside it contains 1800s furnishings and a museum, shedding light on the area&#x27;s history.

The Longhorn Bar beside the tracks on West Broadway is one of the few remaining commercial buildings in typical Nevada style. Not far away is the railroad depot dating from 1880. In 1999 it was presented to the town by the Union Pacific Railroad to be restored and moved to another lot for use as an eatery. This was registered as a historic building in 2004.

The Pershing County Courthouse was built in 1919. Pershing County officials approached Frederic Joseph DeLongchamps, by then the architect of six Nevada courthouses, and asked for a design that would be low in price but distinctive in appearance. As a solution, DeLongchamps designed a round courthouse, patterning it after Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s library at the University of Virginia campus. The circle-over-hexagon design includes a circular interior hallway and a round courtroom decorated with Corinthian pilasters. A broad, sweeping concrete staircase leads to the main floor of the Beaux-Arts classical structure. Its entrance includes a pedimented portico supported by six Ionic columns. Doric pilasters separate the main story windows. Cream-colored brick and terracotta finish the exterior. A shallow dome crowns the roof and provides the courtroom with a dramatic, soaring ceiling.&#x27;

==Lovelock in the arts==
===Songs===
Lovelock, with a population never much more than 2000, will generally be noticed only as a town passed on the way to somewhere else. Thus the debut album of the folk-rock band Center Divide, &quot;Lovelock to Winnemucca&quot; (1999), takes its title from a desert section of the I-80 highway and the opening track, simply titled “Lovelock”, takes its inspiration from the passing landscape. On the other hand, an interrupted journey is the subject of the Hot Buttered Rum string band&#x27;s &quot;Limbo in Lovelock&quot; (&quot;Live in the Northeast&quot; 2007), where a motor breakdown leads to an enforced stop in the town and a visit to the local eatery, the Cowpoke Café.

===Poetry and fiction===
Lovelock has had a poet of its own in Adrian C. Louis, who was brought up on the small reservation for the Lovelock Paiute Indians there. Even after he moved on, its Indian Cemetery was a point of reference for him to which he often returned in memory:
:::I&#x27;m at that place I grew up to leave.
:::Alkali-crusted sand waves have drifted against my markers of blood. 
Other poems in which the town&#x27;s name figures record the impressions of passing travellers. They include Shaun T Griffin&#x27;s broadside, &quot;Rain outside Lovelock, late March” and two titles in the work of Kirk Robertson. &quot;Lovelock to Twin Falls&quot; dwells on abandoned shacks in the desert while “Monday Night, Lovelock” focuses on houses there surrounded by junk.

Stephen Bly&#x27;s Wild West novel &quot;Dangerous Ride Across Humboldt Flats&quot; (Crossway Press, 2003) deals with the area along the river before the town was built. In the opening chapters, an orphaned Pony Express rider comes across Trent Lovelock and his family on Humboldt Flats in 1860 and is befriended by them. The author has acknowledged that he had the town&#x27;s later founder in mind in his fictitious Trent Lovelock.

Another novel, &quot;Lovelock, Nevada: an explanation&quot; (Booklocker, 2010) by Leslie Hale Roberts, plays another variation on the transient theme, starting with a breakdown in the desert. And a stopover in the town was the subject of Fred Leebron&#x27;s prize-winning short story “Lovelock”, later adapted into his novel &quot;Out West&quot; (Doubleday 1996). There an ex-convict staying overnight at a motel picks up a retarded woman and guiltily sees her and her sister off in their car the next morning.

===Painting and sculpture===
Lovelock&#x27;s connection with the figurative arts has most often been the result of artists passing through the area and recording something that had caught their eye. One of the earliest such travellers was Thomas Moran, who caught the train south along the recently completed Central Pacific line in 1876 and sketched a thunderstorm over the nearby Humboldt Plain.

For later artists their local work was the result of travelling the country to create a series on a chosen theme. They have included a watercolor in Bethany Lee&#x27;s 2016 landscapes with a focus on their vegetation, a view in Jessica Joy Jirsa&#x27;s road sign series from 2018, and a casino restaurant in Jody Litton&#x27;s continuing series recording the vernacular architecture of California and adjoining states. The landscape photographer John Pfahl also stopped by the town in 1978 to create two works: a shot of the &quot;Lovelock Seed Co.&quot; at its southern end and &quot;Lovelock gas station&quot; at the north end.

Other painters were commissioned to create works in the town. Ejnar Hansen was invited by the Federal Art Project to paint a mural in the newly completed post-office building in 1940 and chose the discovery of the Comstock Lode as a local subject. In 1944 the gaming artist Franz Trevors (1907–80) was commissioned to paint six large canvases on Western subjects by a member of the local gambling industry and these were later installed in the casino at Felix&#x27;s Bank Club on Main Street. For the main part the paintings were based on subjects by Charles Marion Russell but with original details of the artist&#x27;s own.

Some artists have also chosen to live in Lovelock for a while. Among these was Buck Nimy (1906/11 – 1959), who made black and white drawings of cowboy subjects, some featuring local scenery after he settled in the town about 1940. More recently there has been Maggie Remington, whose speciality is to dig her own pigments from the desert earth to create her abstract designs. Also living there is Don Bridges, who was commissioned to create a memorial for the Emigrant Trail across the Forty-Mile Desert in 2016. Featuring steel reliefs of three oxen and a wagon, it was installed at the 105 freeway exit south of Lovelock, where it was also visible from trains passing nearby.

==History==
It is known as the source of Mantorville limestone, which found its way into buildings across the United States. The limestone quarried in the area was soft and easily carved when first extracted, but became harder as it endured the elements, making it a long-lasting building material. The historic Hubbell House used the stone in 1856, and it was likewise used in 1865 for the Dodge County Courthouse, designed by E. Townsend Mix and now the oldest working courthouse in Minnesota.

Mantorville is named for Peter and Riley Mantor, brothers who came to the settlement in 1853. The Mantorville Historic District, which covers both sides of Minnesota Highway 57 and 5th Street, was added as a historic district to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

The Sierra Nevada Wood and Lumber Company (SNW&amp;L) was a logging company that operated on the northeast side of Lake Tahoe at what is today known as Incline Village, which was named after the SNW&amp;L incline railway that served the area. Timber was required for the mines during the mining boom in the late 1800s of the nearby Comstock Lode in Virginia City. The timber around Lake Tahoe was placed on the incline railway where it was taken up and then dropped by a gravity flume down the western side of mountain to a tunnel to Carson City.

<text>Sparks is a city in Washoe County, Nevada, United States. It was founded in 1904, incorporated on March 15, 1905, and is located just east of Reno. The 2020 U.S. Census counted 108,445 residents in the city. It is the fifth most populous city in Nevada. It is named after John Sparks, Nevada governor (1903–1908), and a member of the Silver Party.

Sparks is located within the Reno–Sparks metropolitan area.

==History==
Euro-American settlement began in the early 1850s, and the population density remained very low until 1904 when the Southern Pacific Railroad built a switch yard and maintenance sheds there, after moving the division point from Wadsworth. In 1902, the Southern Pacific purchased a large tract of swamp-like land near its newly built railyard, and gave employees clear deed to a lot for the sum of $1. It also offered to pick up and move every house in Wadsworth and reassemble it in this new town free of charge. As the population increased, a city was established, first called Harriman, after E. H. Harriman, president of the Southern Pacific, and then renamed Sparks, after John Sparks, then governor of Nevada.

Sparks remained a small town until the 1950s, when economic growth in Reno triggered a housing boom north of the railroad in the area of Sparks. During the 1970s, the area south of the railroad started to fill up with warehouses and light industry. In 1984, the tower for the Nugget Casino Resort was finished, giving Sparks its first, and currently only, high-rise casino. In 1996, the redevelopment effort of the B Street business district across from the Nugget that started in the early 1980s took a step forward with the opening of a multi-screen movie complex and the construction of a plaza area. This area, now known as Victorian Square, is a pedestrian-friendly district that hosts many open-air events.

Under direction of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a comprehensive dynamic water quality computer model, the DSSAM Model, was developed (Earth Metrics, 1987) to analyze impacts of a variety of land use and stormwater management decisions throughout the Truckee River basin; this model was used to develop a set of surface runoff stormwater management measures for Sparks in the 1980s.

Panasonic Energy&#x27;s manufacturing plant in Sparks, Gigafactory 1, produces EV batteries for Tesla. It employed about 7,000 people in 2020.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

The Regional Transportation Commission of Washoe County (RTC) operates a city bus system that serves the cities of Reno and Sparks.

Sparks is served by the nearby Reno–Tahoe International Airport.

====Rail====
The Union Pacific Railroad runs east–west through the center of Sparks. The Union Pacific has a significant rail yard south of I-80, just south and adjacent to the Nugget Hotel/Casino towers in downtown Sparks, and is a central part of the area&#x27;s industrial park. Passenger rail service to the Sparks Amtrak Station ended in 2009, although service continues in neighboring Reno by the California Zephyr.

====Roads====
Interstate 80 runs east–west through Sparks. State Route 445 (Pyramid Way), El Rancho Drive, Sullivan Lane, Rock Boulevard, Sparks Boulevard, Vista Boulevard, and State Route 659 (McCarran Blvd) are the city&#x27;s major north–south thoroughfares. Pyramid Way runs from Nugget Avenue in downtown Sparks to Pyramid Lake, about 35 miles north of the city, and has been designated a Nevada Scenic Byway.

Sparks is connected directly to south Reno by the Southeast Connector. It is a northerly extension of Veterans Parkway to the Sparks Boulevard at Greg Street. It serves as an expressway, with only 2 signaled intersections along its 5.5 mile stretch (one at Pembroke Drive and one at Mira Loma Drive), and constitutes a major arterial connection between Reno and Sparks. It provides an alternative route to existing, overcrowded routes such as the US-395/I-580 freeway, Rock Boulevard, and McCarran Boulevard. Construction began in late 2013, and was completed in July 2018.

Sparks also is gearing up for the record of decision on a major, $1.1 billion (estimated) arterial road project, one that will turn a large portion of Pyramid Highway through nearby Spanish Springs into a controlled access, high speed arterial road that connects directly with the US 395 freeway via a complex interchange at the current Parr Boulevard connection. This will directly connect Spanish Springs, a major population center (parts of which are annexed with the city of Sparks), located in the valley just north of Sparks, with the existing Reno/Sparks freeway system which consists currently of Interstate 80 and US 395. This project will also offer more direct freeway system and inter-valley connections to and from Sun Valley, another major population center of the Reno/Sparks metropolitan statistical area. Sun Valley is located just north of Reno and just west of Spanish Springs, and is home to just over 20,000 residents as of 2020.

<text>Bloomington is a city in Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States. It is located on the north bank of the Minnesota River above its confluence with the Mississippi River, south of downtown Minneapolis and just south of the Interstate 494/694 Beltway. The population was 89,987 at the 2020 census, making it Minnesota&#x27;s fifth-largest city.

Bloomington was established as a post–World War II housing boom suburb connected to Minneapolis&#x27;s urban street grid, and is serviced by four major freeways: Interstate 35W running north-south through the approximate middle of the city, Minnesota State Highway 77, also signed as Cedar Avenue, running north-south near the eastern end of the city, U.S. Highway 169, running north-south along the western boundary of the city, and Interstate 494 running east-west at the northern border. Minnesota State Highway 100 also terminates within city limits at Interstate 494. Large-scale commercial development is concentrated along the I-494 corridor. Besides an extensive city park system, with over of parkland per capita, Bloomington is also home to Hyland Lake Park Reserve in the west and Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge in the southeast.

Bloomington has more jobs per capita than either Minneapolis or Saint Paul, due in part to the United States&#x27; largest enclosed shopping center, the Mall of America, which is located inside of the city. The mall has over 500 stores and contains an amusement park. The headquarters of Dayforce, Donaldson Company, Great Clips, Dairy Queen, HealthPartners, Holiday Stationstores, and Toro, and major operations of Pearson, General Dynamics, Seagate Technologies, and Express Scripts are also based in the city.

The city was named after Bloomington, Illinois.

==History==
In 1839, with renewed conflict with the Ojibwa nation, Chief Cloud Man relocated his band of the Mdewakanton Sioux from Bde Maka Ska in Minneapolis to an area named Oak Grove in southern Bloomington, close to present-day Portland Avenue. In 1843, Peter and Louisa Quinn, the first European settlers to live in Bloomington, built a cabin along the Minnesota River in the area. The government had sent them to teach the Native Americans European-derived farming methods. Gideon Hollister Pond, a missionary who had been following and recording the Dakota language from Cloud Man&#x27;s band, relocated later that year, establishing Oak Grove Mission, his log cabin. Pond and his family held church services and taught the Dakota school subjects and Western farming. Passage across the Minnesota River in Bloomington came in 1849 when William Chambers and Joseph Dean opened the Bloomington Ferry. It remained operational until 1889, when the Bloomington Ferry Bridge was built.

After the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux in 1851, the territory west of the Mississippi River, including Bloomington, was opened to settlers. A group of pioneers settled in Bloomington, including the Goodrich, Whalon, and Ames families. They named the area Bloomington after the city they were from, Bloomington, Illinois. Most early jobs were in farming, blacksmithing, and flour milling. The Oxborough family, who came from Canada, built a trading center on Lyndale Avenue and named it Oxboro Heath. Today, the Clover Shopping Center rests near the old trading center site and the nearby Oxboro Clinic is named after them. The Baliff family opened a grocery and general store at what is today Penn Avenue and Old Shakopee Road, and Hector Chadwick, after moving to the settlement, opened a blacksmith shop near the Bloomington Ferry. In 1855, the first public school for all children was opened in Miss Harrison&#x27;s house, with the first school, Gibson House, built in 1859. On May 11, 1858, the day Minnesota was admitted into the union and officially became a state, 25 residents incorporated the Town of Bloomington. By 1880, the population had grown to 820. In 1892, the first town hall was built at Penn and Old Shakopee Road. By then, the closest Dakota to Minneapolis lived at the residence of Gideon Pond.

===1900s to 1930s===
After 1900, the population surpassed 1,000 and Bloomington began to transform into a city. With rising population came conflict among citizens over social issues. Among the major issues during this period were parents&#x27; unwillingness to consolidate the individual schools into a single, larger school, and fear of mounting taxes. By 1900, there were six rural schools spread throughout the territory with over 200 students enrolled in grades first through eighth. In 1917, the school consolidation issue was settled when voters approved the consolidation. A year later, secondary education and school bus transportation began throughout the city. Telephone service and automobiles appeared.

===1940s to 1950s===
From 1940 to 1960, the city&#x27;s population increased to nine times that of the population at the turn of the century. During the 1940s, the city&#x27;s development vision was low-cost, low-density housing, each with its own well and septic system. The rapid population growth was due in part to the post-World War II boom and subsequent birth of the baby boomer generation. In 1947, the first fire station was constructed and equipped at a cost of $24,000 and the Bloomington Volunteer Fire Department was established with 25 members.
The 1950s saw a considerable expansion of the city and its infrastructure, with the city shifting away from its small-town atmosphere and feel. In 1950, because of the increasing population, the first elementary school, Cedarcrest, was built. It was evident that one consolidated school could no longer serve the growing population, and ten new schools were built in this decade to meet the need. In 1952, the first large business, Toro Manufacturing Company, moved to Bloomington. The significance of this can be seen in Bloomington today, which is home to hundreds of businesses of all types.

In 1953, Bloomington changed from a township to a village form of government. This more professional approach to government was accompanied by open council meetings, land use plans, and published budgets. The effects of this new form of government began immediately, first with the formation of the city police department (at a cost of $2 per taxpayer) and then with the first parkland acquisition. Both Bush Lake Beach and Moir Park were established at a cost of one dollar to each residence. Today, about 1/3 of the city&#x27;s land area is devoted to city and regional parks, playgrounds, and open space. In 1956, the first city land-use plan was initiated with the construction of Interstate 35W and Metropolitan Stadium.

In 1957, Bloomington High School opened at West 88th Street and Sheridan Avenue South.

In 1958, the city changed from a village government to a council-manager form. One of the first policies the council adopted was encouragement of commercial and industrial development, low-cost housing, and shopping centers. Due to the rapid population increase during this time, police and fire departments changed to a 24-hour dispatching system, and the fire department (now with 46 members) converted a garage into the second fire station.

===1960s to 1970s===

The 1960s saw accelerated school and business growth throughout the city. On November 8, 1960, Bloomington officially became a city as voters approved the city&#x27;s organizing document, the city charter. The charter provides for a council-manager form of government in which the city council exercises the city&#x27;s legislative power and determines all city policies (see City of Bloomington Government). In 1965, a second high school, John F. Kennedy High School, was built, and Bloomington High School was renamed Abraham Lincoln High School. In 1967, a second and third official fire station were approved and built to more effectively combat fires in the increasingly large city. In 1968, Normandale State Junior College opened with an initial enrollment of 1,358 students. In 1974, it was renamed Normandale Community College to reflect expanded courses of study.
From 1961 to 1981, Bloomington was home to most of Minnesota&#x27;s major sports teams. In 1961, after the completion of Metropolitan Stadium in 1956, both the Minnesota Twins and Minnesota Vikings began regular-season play. Though originally built for the American Association Minneapolis Millers, a minor league baseball team, Metropolitan Stadium was renovated and expanded for Major League Baseball and the National Football League. The first Twins game was held on April 21 (Washington 5, Twins 3) and the first Vikings game was held on September 17 (Vikings 37, Chicago Bears 13). On August 21, 1965, The Beatles played Metropolitan Stadium, their only stop ever in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. In 1967, with the expansion of the National Hockey League, the Metropolitan Sports Center was built near Metropolitan Stadium and the Minnesota North Stars began play later that year.

A number of new city buildings were constructed in the 1970s. In 1970, Thomas Jefferson High School, Bloomington Ice Garden rink one, and a fourth fire station were built. In 1971, school enrollment peaked with 26,000 students, and the fire department had grown to a force of 105 men. (In 1974, after a six-hour city council meeting, women were allowed to join the Bloomington Fire Department, but the city&#x27;s first female firefighter, Ann Majerus Meyer, did not join the department until 1984; she retired in 2013). In 1975, a second rink was added to the Bloomington Ice Garden and a fifth fire station built, with a sixth added in 1979.

===1980s to present===
 The 1980s brought radical change to Bloomington with the departure of the Twins and Vikings. On September 30, 1981, the last baseball game was played at Metropolitan Stadium (Kansas City Royals 5, Twins 2) as the Twins and Vikings moved to the newly constructed Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in downtown Minneapolis for the 1982 season. In 1985, the Bloomington Port Authority purchased the Met Stadium site and in less than two years approved first site plans for Mall of America. Two years later, groundbreaking took place for the new megamall, and in 1992, it opened to the public. Today, tenants of Mall of America, when combined, constitute the largest private-sector employer in Bloomington, employing about 13,000 people.

In 1993, the Minnesota North Stars moved to Dallas, and a year later the Metropolitan Sports Center was demolished. In 2004, an IKEA store opened on the west end of the former Met Center site. The remainder of the property is planned to be the site for Mall of America Phase II. In May 2006, the Water Park of America opened. It is the country&#x27;s ninth-largest indoor waterpark.

In 2019, Bloomington passed an ordinance that forbade filming students of Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center in a public park, which led to a successful lawsuit in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit against the city to reinstate the First Amendment rights of the parties involved. Keith Ellison had previously asked the court to drop the case.

Bloomington was a potential site for hosting the Expo 2027. However, in June 2023, Belgrade, Serbia was chosen for hosting the Expo 2027.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and or 9.73% is water.

There are three primary land types in the city. The northeastern part of the city is a sand plain, low hills dominate the western part, and the far south lies within the valley of the Minnesota River.

About a third of the city is permanently reserved for park purposes, including two large natural areas—the Minnesota Valley&#x27;s wetlands (controlled by the City and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service) and the Hyland Lake Park Reserve (controlled by the Three Rivers Park District).

Water bodies in the city include Bush Lake, Long Meadow Lake, Lake Normandale, Marsh Lake (Hennepin), Nine Mile Creek, Penn Lake and about 100 small lakes and ponds with their wetland habitats.

The city is informally divided by Interstate 35W into &quot;West Bloomington&quot; and &quot;East Bloomington&quot;. West Bloomington is mostly residential with newer housing stock, along with multi-story office high-rises along Interstate Highway 494 in the north, whereas East Bloomington contains more industry, destination retail centers, and the majority of Bloomington&#x27;s less expensive housing. The dividing line may be placed as far west as France Avenue, where the high school attendance boundaries meet.

==Economy==
The city is home to a large contingent of employers, providing more than 100,000 jobs. Benefiting from its proximity to major transportation routes and the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport, Bloomington is a major hospitality center with nearly 8,000 hotel rooms.

Ceridian, Donaldson Company, the Evangelical Free Church of America, Great Clips, Leeann Chin, HealthPartners, Holiday Stationstores, Highland Bank, Thermo King, Dairy Queen and Toro have their headquarters in Bloomington.

===Top employers===

According to the City&#x27;s 2023 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:

Other major employers include Express Scripts, Holiday Stationstores, Thermo King Corporation/Ingersoll Rand Inc., and Polar Semiconductor Inc.

==Education==
ISD 271 has served the preK–12 educational needs of the city since the 1960s, with an operating fund revenue of $148.1 million in 2020. Fifteen public schools in Bloomington are operated by the district as well as a K-12 online school, governed by a seven-member elected school board, which appointed Superintendent Eric Melbye in 2021. The previous superintendent, Les Fujitake, served from 2006 until 2020. The city&#x27;s first public charter school, Seven Hills Preparatory Academy, opened in 2006. As many families remain in or continue to move into the city, there has been support for levy increases. In 1999, the then-largest school bond issue in Minnesota history was approved, funding a $107 million school expansion and renovation project.

The district&#x27;s two high schools are John F. Kennedy High School in the east Thomas Jefferson High School in the west. New Code Academy is an online high school for students in any area. The determining boundary for high school attendance runs near the center of Bloomington on France and Xerxes Avenues, though both schools have open enrollment.

Bloomington&#x27;s third high school, Abraham Lincoln High School (originally Bloomington High School), closed in 1982 and was sold to the Control Data Corporation in the mid-1980s. Bloomington Stadium, next to the former high school, is still used by both Kennedy High School and Jefferson High School for football, lacrosse, and soccer games.

Mindquest, the nation&#x27;s first online public high school, operated between 1995 and 2003 through the Bloomington Public Schools.

The Minneapolis Ski Club hosted the 2013 Junior National competition. The city also operates the Bloomington Ice Garden (BIG), which contains three ice rinks, one of which is Olympic-size and the other of which has a capacity of 2,500. It appeared in the film Miracle, with the team practicing there before the Olympics. During the winter, the Parks and Recreation Department creates 10+ outdoor skating rinks.

Bloomington was the point of growth for pickleball in Minnesota, beginning about 2005 when retirees brought the sport back from their southern-states retirement homes. From the Westwood Athletic Fields in southern Bloomington, other groups formed and grew to an active statewide player population in excess of 1,500. Bloomington is also the home of Pickleball Minnesota, the Pickleball website serving the state and the Upper Midwest.
Bloomington has two major sports complexes. Dred Scott Playfields, named after Dred Scott, is on the far West side and contains a variety of recreational activities, including baseball, softball, football, sand volleyball, tennis, and basketball. Also within the complex are an outdoor batting cage and a miniature golf course that are privately owned. Valley View Playfields on the East side contains softball and baseball fields, bocce ball courts, and the Bloomington Family Aquatic Center. Bush Lake Beach (BLB) is on Bush Lake and is open in the summer to recreational swimmers.

==Economy==
Maple Grove is home to a regional Boston Scientific research, development, and manufacturing facility, employing over 3,000 people. Other major employers include Independent School District 279, Nortech Systems, and the city of Maple Grove.

The city is home to a gravel mining area owned by Tiller Corporation and C.S. McCrossan. Active since the 1920s, the GMA is slowly being developed into a residential and commercial downtown. The first phase included Main Street, a collection of one- and two-story buildings with storefronts in new urbanist (or neotraditional) style. The second phase was generally considered to be the Shoppes of Arbor Lakes and the third phase was the Fountains at Arbor Lakes.

Minnesota&#x27;s first so-called &quot;lifestyle center&quot;, The Shoppes at Arbor Lakes, is designed in the spirit of a mid-century American village. The center was built in 2003 and has been replicated in Woodbury, Minnesota (Woodbury Lakes). The development is and is home to more than 65 stores and restaurants.

An additional phase of Arbor Lakes development is a hybrid power center development called The Fountains at Arbor Lakes. At , this retail complex includes a water park. The Fountains also includes Minnesota&#x27;s most energy-efficient building, Great River Energy Headquarters. Maple Grove&#x27;s Main Street area is part of the Arbor Lakes retail area. The Village at Arbor Lakes includes hotels, restaurants, and additional retail space.

The Grove is at the intersection of Interstate 94 and Maple Grove Parkway in northwest Maple Grove. This district is home to the new North Memorial/Fairview hospital complex and stores. The project&#x27;s central portion is designed to be pedestrian-friendly and encourage a small-town atmosphere.

Maple Grove is home to more retail than nearly any other city in the state, second only to Bloomington, home of the Mall of America. Maple Grove likely has nearly of commercial development at build-out, which may soon push the city into the number one spot for retail square footage. One prominent retail complex is the Grove Square shopping mall. Opus Northwest, the developer of the property, selected the location of the initial property development because &quot;it’s the first major city in upstate Minnesota&quot; and serves as &quot;a major hub for that submarket&quot; drawing consumers from the entire upstate region.

==Government==


Maple Grove is served by a city council consisting of a mayor and four council members who all serve four-year terms. City Council members serve at large. City elections coincide with the general elections held in the fall of all even-numbered years. Mark Steffenson is the current mayor and has served since June 2001. Current city council members are Rachelle Johnson, Kristy Janigo, Mike Ostaffe, and Jon McCullough

On May 6, 1974, the city council voted to establish a volunteer fire department. In 1986, the original fire station was closed and two new stations were built. There are five fire stations in the city.

Maple Grove is in the 7th District of Hennepin County. The commissioner for the 7th district is Kevin Anderson.

<text>Robbinsdale is a city in Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States. Its population was 14,646 at the 2020 census. The city is in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area and is adjacent to the northwest portion of Minneapolis.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water.

Minnesota State Highway 100 and County Road 81 are two of the main routes in the city.

==History==
Shortly after the Minnesota Territorial Legislature created Hennepin County in 1852, John C. Bohanon filed the first claim in the Township of Crystal Lake. Railroads reached the area in 1880. A flag station was established near the farm of Alfred Parker, and six years later he donated land for a depot. The community that grew around it came to be known as Parker&#x27;s Station. In 1887 Minneapolis made an effort to secure more taxable property by annexing neighboring townships. In response, Crystal Lake farmers incorporated the Village of Crystal. 

Later that year, entrepreneur, civil war veteran, and real estate developer Andrew Bonney Robbins came to Parker&#x27;s Station on behalf of an Illinois business interest. Robbins was a former state senator and the brother-in-law of lumber baron Thomas Barlow Walker. Robbins purchased 90 acres (360,000 m2) to the west of Lower Twin Lake to incorporate into the Robbinsdale Park subdivision.

From 1888, new industries moved in and a large Lutheran seminary was built. In 1890, Robbins built a 16-room Queen Anne-style mansion on Lower Twin Lake. After he moved his family in, Robbins found investors to build the Hubbard Specialty Manufacturing Company. This firm made chairs and wheelbarrows. Despite his connections, Robbins could not persuade the Minneapolis Street Railway Company to extend a streetcar line up West Broadway. In 1891 he organized the North Side Street Railway Company and built his own line from the Minneapolis city limits to Robbinsdale Park. The streetcars were pulled by horses until the line was converted to electricity. 

Robbins&#x27;s development efforts led to tension between farm families and residents near the village center. A special election was held and a vote to dissolve the Village of Crystal carried unanimously. On April 19, 1893, the 2.9-square-mile village of Robbinsdale was organized.

Fawcett Publications was founded in 1919 in Robbinsdale with the publication of &quot;Captain Billy&#x27;s Whiz Bang&quot;. In 1922, Fawcett introduced &quot;True Confessions&quot; magazine, which was popular among female readers. The city&#x27;s pulp magazine history is echoed in Robbinsdale&#x27;s annual summer celebration, Whiz Bang Days. In 1929, Fawcett launched &quot;Modern Mechanics&quot;, a magazine on ingenuity and do-it-yourself projects. The first issue&#x27;s cover line was &quot;Build your own airplane!&quot;. &quot;Modern Mechanics&quot; was later renamed Mechanix Illustrated. In 1930, Fawcett Publications moved to downtown Minneapolis&#x27;s Sexton Building. 

In 1940, Samuel Samuelson built Victory Hospital on property he owned in Robbinsdale. The original marble-faced, three-story building had five operating rooms and 70 beds. In 1954, Victory Hospital was reorganized as a nonprofit and renamed North Memorial. Over the next 50 years, it grew into a 518-bed medical center. Today, North Memorial Medical Center is a regional trauma center with eight helicopters, 120 ambulances, and 725 employees. It is one of Minnesota&#x27;s Level 1 trauma centers and operates AirCare, an air medical transport service with five flight bases around the state.

In 1951, Sidney and William Volk hired the architectural firm Liebenberg and Kaplan to redesign the Terrace Theatre. Situated on a rise overlooking Crystal Lake and Bottineau Boulevard, the theater was considered an example of mid-century modern design. Its rectangular volumes originally contained a 1300-seat auditorium, an expansive lobby, a sunken garden-style lounge with a large copper fireplace, sweeping foyers, and two snack bars.

The Terrace closed in 1999 and its owner did not take care of the property. In 2016, the City of Robbinsdale and State of Minnesota passed resolutions commemorating the Terrace as an important historic landmark. Nevertheless, after some debate and a lawsuit, the Terrace was torn down in 2016 and replaced by a Hy-Vee grocery store.

==Education==
Robbinsdale is served by Robbinsdale Area Schools. 

There are two public schools and one parochial school within the city limits:
* Lakeview Elementary School (PreK through 5th grade)
* Robbinsdale Middle School (6th though 8th grades)
* Sacred Heart Catholic School (PreK through 8th grade)

In 1959, Conforte served 22 months in jail after attempting to blackmail Washoe County District Attorney Bill Raggio, who summarily had the ranch burned down.
*On December 15, 1971, a bill to protect American mustangs was signed into law by President Nixon, making it a violation of federal law to use aircraft or motorized vehicles on public land in hunting wild horses and burros. Velma Bronn Johnston of Wadsworth, nicknamed &quot;Wild Horse Annie&quot;, had lobbied Congress to pass the bill.
*Wadsworth is known to participants in the Burning Man festival as the exit from Interstate 80 that one takes to get to Black Rock City. The event is held in the Black Rock Desert which is near Gerlach, north of Wadsworth on State Route 447.
*Wadsworth is also home base to a popular Christian Rock radio station, named Renegade Radio, which broadcasts at 101.3 FM and streams at renegaderadio.org

Holly O&#x27;Driscoll of the &quot;Nevada Living Magazine&quot; described it as &quot;a small, older&quot; facility. In 2017 Siobhan McAndrew of the &quot;Reno Gazette Journal&quot; stated that historically Natchez had issues with academic performance but by 2017 had a new principal and newly hired teachers. The district extensively renovated the school in summer 2017, spending $1.5 million to do so.

Residents zoned to Natchez Elementary are zoned to Mendive Middle School and Edward C. Reed High School.

Some students at Natchez Elementary matriculate to a Bureau of Indian Education-contracted secondary school, Pyramid Lake Schools.

<text>Rogers is a city located in Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 13,295 at the 2020 census. In 2012, the city 
annexed the surrounding Hassan Township. The City of Rogers is considered a northwest suburb of the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area. The city&#x27;s economy is mostly based on industrial activity and agriculture.

The city is located on either side of Interstate 94, with Minnesota State Highway 101 running north and its western boundary touches the Crow River.

==Geography==
Rogers is located at (45.1888534, -93.5530144).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

==History==
In the 1880s, Thomas Rogers sold an acre of his land, then part of Hassan Township, to Great Northern Railroad for a dollar. The new depot provided a convenient stop for the rich timber resources of the area and served as the beginning ground of a new community. When St. Martin Catholic Church and school were added, Rogers grew in local importance, consequently causing new businesses to be built and the town to be regarded as more of a local hub than other nearby communities such as Fletcher. In 1914, the city was incorporated.

Throughout the years the town grew slowly until, in 1972, Interstate 94 was constructed. Running right through Rogers, the new freeway provided easy access to Minneapolis and Saint Paul, causing additional businesses such as Graco, CDI, Dept. 56 and Reinhart FoodService to add operations. The additional jobs created new population growth. As growth occurred, additional land was required, causing Rogers to annex more and more land from the surrounding Hassan Township. Hassan was completely annexed into Rogers on January 1, 2012.

Early founding families names still serve as key contributors to the community. Otto Scharber was a prominent local businessman, owning a grocery store, hardware store, and a John Deere implement dealership, which is still in family operation today.

==Tornado==

The tornado began three miles west of Rogers at 9:52pm The tornado made its first strike on Rogers at 9:54pm The tornado traveled along a path that was eight miles and lasted for approximately 12 minutes. The tornado also resulted in six injuries and the death of a 10-year-old girl, Jayme Wendt.

==Annexation of Hassan Township==
On January 1, 2012, Hassan Township, Hennepin County&#x27;s last township, was completely annexed into Rogers. Talks of annexation between Rogers and Hassan Township can be traced back to the 1970s, but the formal agreement was approved on December 30, 2003. In 2008, the Rogers City Council and the Hassan Town Board accelerated the annexation date to January 1, 2012. This was the third and final phase of annexation, boosting the Rogers population to over 11,000 residents.

<text>St. Louis Park is a city in Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 50,010 at the 2020 census. It is a first-ring suburb immediately west of Minneapolis. Other adjacent cities include Edina, Golden Valley, Minnetonka, Plymouth, and Hopkins.

The Pavek Museum of Broadcasting, which has a major collection of antique radio and television equipment, is also in the city. Items range from radios produced by local manufacturers to the Vitaphone system used to cut discs carrying audio for the first &quot;talkie&quot;, &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;.

Filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen, who grew up in St. Louis Park, set their 2009 film &quot;A Serious Man&quot; in the city . It was important to the Coens to find a neighborhood of original-looking suburban rambler homes as they would have appeared in St. Louis Park in the mid-1960s, and after careful scouting they opted to film scenes in a neighborhood of nearby Bloomington, as well as at St. Louis Park&#x27;s B&#x27;nai Emet Synagogue, which was later sold and converted into a school.

==History==

===Early developments===
The name &quot;St. Louis Park&quot; was derived from the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway that ran through the area; the word &quot;Park&quot; was added to avoid confusion with St. Louis, Missouri. The settlement was incorporated as a village in 1886, and from 1887 to 1890, its post office was called &quot;Elmwood&quot;.

In 1892, lumber baron Thomas Barlow Walker and a group of wealthy Minneapolis industrialists incorporated the Minneapolis Land and Investment Company to focus industrial development in Minneapolis. Walker&#x27;s company also began developing St. Louis Park for industrial, commercial and residential use.

Generally, development progressed outward from the original village center at the intersection of the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway with Wooddale Avenue. But Minneapolis soon expanded as far west as France Avenue, and its boundary may have continued to move westward had it not been for St. Louis Park&#x27;s 1886 incorporation.

By 1893, St. Louis Park&#x27;s downtown, then located along Broadway (current-day Walker Street) near Lake Street, had three hotels and several fraternal meeting halls, and many newly arrived companies surrounded downtown. Around 1890, the village had more than 600 industrial jobs, mostly associated with agriculture implement manufacturing at the massive Moline Plow Company factory once located just south of downtown.
The financial panic of 1893 altered developers&#x27; plans and put a damper on the village&#x27;s growth. Walker left St. Louis Park to pursue other business ventures.

In 1899, St. Louis Park became the home to the Peavey–Haglin Experimental Concrete Grain Elevator, the world&#x27;s first concrete, tubular grain elevator, which provided an alternative to combustible wooden elevators. Despite being nicknamed &quot;Peavey&#x27;s Folly&quot; and dire predictions that the elevator would burst like a balloon when the grain was drawn off, the experiment worked and concrete elevators have been used ever since.

===Suburban boom===
At the end of World War I, only seven scattered retail stores operated in St. Louis Park because streetcars provided easy access to shopping in Minneapolis. Between 1920 and 1930, the population doubled from 2,281 to 4,710. Vigorous homebuilding occurred in the late 1930s to accommodate the pent-up need created during the Depression. With America&#x27;s involvement in World War II, however, all development came to a halt.

Explosive growth came after World War II. In 1940, 7,737 people lived in St. Louis Park. By 1955, more than 30,000 new residents had joined them. From 1940 to 1955, growth averaged 6.9 persons moving into St. Louis Park every day. Sixty percent of St. Louis Park&#x27;s homes were built in a single burst of construction from the late 1940s to the early 1950s.

Residential development was closely followed by commercial developers eager to bring goods and services to these new households. In the late 1940s, Minnesota&#x27;s first shopping center — the Lilac Way — was constructed on the northeast corner of Excelsior Boulevard and Highway 100. (The Lilac Way shopping center was torn down in the late 1980s to make way for redevelopment.) Miracle Mile shopping center, built in 1950, and Knollwood Mall, which opened in 1956, remain open today.

In the late 1940s, a group of 11 former army doctors opened the St. Louis Park Medical Center in a small building on Excelsior Boulevard. The medical center merged with Methodist Hospital and today is Park Nicollet Health Services, part of HealthPartners, the second-largest medical clinic in Minnesota (after Rochester&#x27;s Mayo Clinic).

During the period between 1950 and 1956, 66 new subdivisions were recorded to make room for 2,700 new homes. In 1953 and 1954, the final two parcels — Kilmer and Shelard Park — were annexed. These parcels (originally in Minnetonka) came to St. Louis Park because of their ability to provide sewer and water service. According to Al Franken, whose mother was a realtor there, in the Twin Cities the area was nicknamed St. Jewish Park, given that 20% of its residents were of Jewish background. He states also that there appeared to be a tacit agreement between bankers, developers and real estate agents to ensure redlining, in order to prevent the spread of Jewish and Afro-American families across streets like Texas Avenue into areas with a different ethnic composition.

===From village to city===
In 1954, voters approved a home rule charter that gave an overwhelmed St. Louis Park the status of a city. That enabled the city to hire a city manager to assume some of the duties handled by the part-time city council. Several bridges built during that time are now being repaired or razed.

In those days, the primary concerns were the physical planning of St. Louis Park, updating zoning and construction codes, expanding sewer and water systems, paving streets, acquiring park land and building schools.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Interstate 394, U.S. Highway 169, and Minnesota State Highways 7 and 100 are four of the main routes in St. Louis Park.

The city has a relatively high Jewish population for Minnesota, and is home to the Sabes Jewish Community Center and several synagogues including Beth El Synagogue and Kenesseth Israel Congregation. It is estimated that around 38% of Jews in the greater Minneapolis area live in St. Louis Park.
Due, in part, to mass immigration from former-Soviet states, St. Louis Park has a large Russian population around its Aquila area. The Russian language is the second most spoken language in the city after English, and the Hennepin County Library&#x27;s St. Louis Park location has an extensive Russian language section.

==Government==
St. Louis Park operates under the Council/Manager form of government. An elected City Council sets the policy and overall direction for the city. Then city workers, under the direction of a professional city manager carry out council decisions and provide day-to-day city services. The city manager is accountable to the City Council. St. Louis Park voters elect the mayor and six (two at-large and four ward) City Council members to four-year terms. The mayor and at-large council members represent all residents; the ward council members are primarily responsible for representing their ward constituents.

==Politics==


St. Louis Park is in Minnesota&#x27;s 5th congressional district, represented by Ilhan Omar, a Democrat. The town was placed in this district, which includes traditionally liberal segments of Minneapolis, in the redistricting after the 1990 census. Before that, St. Louis Park had been part of the 3rd congressional district, along with Edina and other more conservative suburbs. The 3rd district was represented by Republicans Clark MacGregor and William Frenzel from 1961 until 1991.

Succeeding Jake Spano, mayor Nadia Mohamed is the first elected Somali American mayor of a US city. She won election to the position on November 7, 2023.

==Education==

===Public schools===
The St. Louis Park School District, Independent School District 283, is home to seven public schools serving about 4,200 students in grades K–12 students. St. Louis Park is the only school district in Minnesota in which every public school has been recognized as a Blue Ribbon School of Excellence by the U.S. Department of Education.

In the 1960s, the proportion of school-age children in St. Louis Park was much higher than it is now, although the population has not changed much. Due to declining enrollment over the years, there have been several changes to schools in the district:
*Ethel Baston Elementary School was closed; its building is now occupied by Groves Academy, a private school.
*Fern Hill Elementary School was closed; its building is now occupied by Torah Academy of Minneapolis, a private school.
*Oak Hill Elementary School opened in 1950 and closed in 1967. Oak Hill enrollment was limited to students in grades one and two, as well as one special education class.
*Park Knoll Elementary School was demolished to expand the Knollwood Mall.
*Brookside Elementary School, Lenox Elementary School, and Eliot Elementary School were closed as public school buildings: Brookside was procured by a developer who converted the school into condominiums; Lenox Community Center has the SLP Senior Program and preschool on the main floor, with nonprofits on the second; Eliot was sold to a developer who tore it down to build apartment buildings in 2014.
*Central Community Center, formerly Central Junior High School, now houses the Park Spanish Immersion School and other ISD 283 programs, including Early Childhood Special Education (ECSE), Early Childhood Family Education (ECFE), and Community Education programs including Gymnastics and Swimming. For some years, there were two junior high schools in St. Louis Park. The one now called St. Louis Park Middle School was then Westwood Junior High School.
*Peter Hobart Elementary School and Aquila Elementary School became Peter Hobart Primary Center and Aquila Primary Center, serving only grades K through 3, and Susan Lindgren Elementary School and Cedar Manor Elementary School became intermediate schools serving only grades 4 through 6.
*In 1970, St. Louis Park Senior High School served only grades 10 through 12 and had about 2500 students; now it serves grades 9 through 12 and serves about 1350 students.
*In 2010, Cedar Manor Elementary School was closed. Peter Hobart Elementary, Susan Lindgren Elementary, Aquila Elementary, and Park Spanish Immersion were converted to Kindergarten through 5th grade schools, with grade 6 moving to St. Louis Park Junior High.
*In 2019, Park Spanish Immersion Elementary School moved operations to the Cedar Manor building.

====Athletic teams====
St. Louis Park&#x27;s athletic teams are called the Orioles. The school colors are orange and black. In 2005 the school moved out of the Classic Lake Conference and into the North Suburban Conference. In 2013, the school moved out of the North Suburban Conference and into the Metro West Conference.

The school won the boys&#x27; state basketball tournament in 1962 under coach Lloyd Holm, and had a resurgence in boys&#x27; basketball in the 1970s under coach August Schmidt.

The girls&#x27; basketball teams won two state championships in 1986 and 1990 under head coach Phil Frerk. The school also has a synchronized swimming program.

For many years, a fixture at Park athletic events was the school dance line, the Parkettes, who served as cheerleaders for the Minnesota Vikings from 1964 to 1983.

Athletes to come out of St. Louis Park include former NBA player and current Timberwolves broadcaster Jim Peterson (1980), NFL coach Marc Trestman (1974), former NHL player Erik Rasmussen (1995), Junior All-American cross-country skier Andrew J. Cheesebro, and former MLB player T. J. Bohn (1998). 1965 graduate Bob Stein was an All-American end at the University of Minnesota and the youngest player ever to play in a Super Bowl, for the Kansas City Chiefs. He later served as the President of the Minnesota Timberwolves from 1987 to 1994. Former Minnesota Vikings and Tennessee Titans President Jeff Diamond is a 1971 St. Louis Park graduate.

<text>Ely (, ) is the largest city and county seat of White Pine County, Nevada, United States. Ely was founded as a stagecoach station along the Pony Express and Central Overland Route. In 1906 copper was discovered. Ely&#x27;s mining boom came later than the other towns along US 50. The railroads connecting the transcontinental railroad to the mines in Austin, Nevada and Eureka, Nevada have long been removed, but the railroad to Ely is preserved as a heritage railway by the Nevada Northern Railway and known as the &quot;Ghost Train of Old Ely&quot;. As of the 2020 census, the population was 3,924.

==History==

In 1878, Vermont resident J. W. Long came to White Pine County and soon set up a camp known as &quot;Ely&quot;, after discovering gold. The name &quot;Ely&quot; has been credited to several possible origins: Long&#x27;s hometown of Ely, Vermont; a New York Congressman with the surname Ely, who sent Long as a representative according to local historians; Smith Ely, a Vermont native who financed one of the city&#x27;s early mineral operations; and John Ely, an Illinois native who came to Nevada for mining.

Ely was founded as a stagecoach station along the Pony Express and Central Overland Route. Ely&#x27;s mining boom came later than the other towns along US 50, with the discovery of copper in 1906. This made Ely a mining town, suffering through the boom-and-bust cycles so common in the West. Originally, Ely was home to a number of copper mining companies, Kennecott Utah Copper being the most famous. With a crash in the copper market in the mid-1970s, Kennecott shut down and copper mining disappeared (temporarily).
With the advent of cyanide heap leaching—a method of extracting gold from what was previously considered very low-grade ore—the next boom was on. Many companies processed the massive piles of &quot;overburden&quot; that had been removed from copper mines, or expanded the existing open-pit mines to extract the gold ore. Gold mines as widespread as the Robinson project near Ruth, and AmSelco&#x27;s Alligator Ridge mine from Ely, kept the town alive during the 1980s and 1990s, until the recent revival of copper mining.

As Kennecott&#x27;s smelter was demolished, copper concentrate from the mine is now shipped by rail to Seattle, where it is transported to Japan for smelting. The dramatic increase in demand for copper in 2005 has once again made Ely a copper boom town.

The now-defunct BHP Nevada Railroad ran from the mining district south of Ruth through Ely to the junction with the Union Pacific at Shafter from 1996 to 1999.

<text>McGill is a census-designated place (CDP) in White Pine County, Nevada, United States. The population was 1,148 at the 2010 census.

==History==
In 1872, John Cowger established a ranch in the Steptoe Valley and acquired the water rights for the area. William Lyons and William McGill purchased the ranch in 1886. A post office was established at the ranch, now named McGill Ranch, in 1891.

The Nevada Consolidated Copper Company had numerous mines in the region and was seeking a partner to create a smelter in the area. The Cumberland and Ely Mining Corporation had acquired of land near the ranch and thought it would be ideal for a smelter location due to access to a plentiful water source. The two companies formed a partnership, the Steptoe Valley Smelting and Mining Company.

In 1906, a pipeline was built to bring water from Duck Creek to reservoirs near the smelter site and construction began on the smelter. The smelter was completed and operations began on May 15, 1908. The first copper was shipped from the smelter on August 7 of the same year.

The town was briefly known as Smelter, before being renamed McGill, after the ranch. The population of the town grew from its inception to 1,904 in 1910 and 2,864 in 1920.

Kennecott Utah Copper acquired Nevada Consolidated Copper Company, which included Steptoe Valley Smelting and Mining Company and the smelter at McGill in 1932. Up until the 1950s, McGill was a company town, owned by Kennecott. In the 1950s Kennecott started selling McGill&#x27;s homes and businesses to individuals. In 1983, the price of copper along with the low grade ore being mined led to Kennecott closing the smelter and demolishing it. With the primary employer gone, the population of McGill decreased to its current levels.

<text>Alton is a town in Belknap County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 5,894 at the 2020 census, up from 5,250 at the 2010 census. It is home to Alton Bay State Forest and Mount Major State Forest.

The primary settlement in town, where 499 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as the Alton census-designated place (CDP) and is centered on the intersection of New Hampshire Route 11 and New Hampshire Route 140. The town also includes the village of Alton Bay, a long-time resort located beside Lake Winnipesaukee.

==History==
Originally called &quot;New Durham Gore&quot; because of rocky upland areas, or &quot;gores&quot;, the town was settled in 1770, mainly by farmers because the highland areas provided less frost. Merchants then filled the lowlands. Early Alton history recounts stories of the merchants trying to convince the farmers to incorporate. They would succeed on January 15, 1796, when the community was named after Alton, a small market town in Hampshire, England.

Alton was part of Strafford County until Belknap County was erected on December 22, 1840. By 1840, the village of Alton existed at the town&#x27;s center. In 1847, the Cochecho Railroad began bringing passengers and freight to Alton Village and Alton Bay. By 1859, the town had two gristmills, seven sawmills, and five shoe factories. But the most famous business was the Rockwell Clough Company, established by William Rockwell Clough, inventor of the corkscrew. By 1903, his company was producing 30 million corkscrews worldwide.

Since the mid-19th century, however, tourism has been the principal business. In 1863, an Adventist group held a camp meeting at Alton Bay, which was the terminus of the Dover and Winnipiseogee Railroad. That was incorporated as the Alton Bay Camp Meeting Association (now known as &quot;Alton Bay Christian Conference Center&quot;) in 1876. In 1872, the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad launched at Alton Bay the steamer &quot;Mount Washington&quot;, the first side-wheeler and largest vessel on Lake Winnipesaukee. When destroyed by fire in 1939, a replacement ship was found, also christened &quot;Mount Washington&quot;. Today, it continues to carry summer tourists between stops on the lake. The railway survived until 1935, and the old station at Alton Bay is now a community center.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 23.4% of the town. Alton is located at the southern end of Lake Winnipesaukee, around the inlet known as Alton Bay. The village of Alton Bay is located at the southern tip of the bay, while the main village of Alton is located farther south. The town is drained by the Merrymeeting River, the main inlet to Alton Bay. Mount Major, in Mount Major State Forest, has an elevation of above sea level. Popular with hikers, the summit offers unsurpassed views of Lake Winnipesaukee. The highest point in Alton is the north peak of Straightback Mountain, at , just west of Mount Major. Both mountains are part of the Belknap Mountains range. Alton lies almost fully within the Merrimack River watershed, though a tiny corner is in the Piscataqua River (coastal) watershed.

The town is served by five state highways. New Hampshire Route 11 passes through the center of town, leading northwest along the shore of Lake Winnipesaukee to Gilford and thence to Laconia, and southeast to Rochester. New Hampshire Route 28 also passes through the center of town, leading north to Wolfeboro and south to Pittsfield and Manchester. New Hampshire Route 140 leads from Alton west to Gilmanton and Tilton. New Hampshire Route 11A leaves NH 11 in West Alton and goes west into Gilford, and New Hampshire Route 28A forms an alternate route north from Alton Bay to NH 28.

The land that is now Park Rapids, was originally inhabited by Native American tribes, including the Ojibwe (Chippewa) people which still maintain a significant presence in the region. Park Rapids became a city in 1882, and was named by Frank C. Rice after the park groves and prairies beside the Fish Hook River rapids. These rapids have since been dammed. Located at the convergence of prairie and pine forest, Park Rapids emerged as a supply depot by farmers and the lumber industry. Early on it served as a crucial hub for trappers, the local Ojibwa community, and timber cruisers to exchange goods, report, and replenished supplies. Later Park Rapids grew into a logging center, with numerous trails leading north for tote teams transporting goods. Its main street was designed unusually wide to accommodate the long, horse-drawn teams essential for the town&#x27;s operations.

<text>Barnstead is a town in Belknap County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 4,915 at the 2020 census, up from 4,593 at the 2010 census. Home to the Suncook Lakes, Barnstead includes the villages of Center Barnstead, Barnstead Parade (identified as &quot;Barnstead&quot; on topographic maps) and South Barnstead.

==History==
The town was granted on May 20, 1727, by Lieutenant Governor John Wentworth to the Reverend Joseph Adams and others. Settlement commenced in 1765, and two years later Barnstead was incorporated as a town by Governor John Wentworth. Many of the settlers came from Barnstable, Massachusetts, and Hempstead, New York—the name is taken from these two.

Although not mountainous, the terrain forms large swells, good for grazing. By 1830, when the population was 2,047, the town contained about 2,500 sheep. Farmers found the soil easy to cultivate and productive. The Suncook River and its tributaries provided water power for mills. By 1859, industries included a woolen cloth factory, seven sawmills, four shingle mills, four clapboard mills, one grooving machine, one turning machine, and two tanneries. Barnstead manufactured large amounts of lumber, which it supplied to neighboring towns.

Barnstead was served in 1874 by the Concord and Rochester Railroad, and an extension of the Suncook Valley Railroad was being planned.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 4.2% of the town. The highest point in Barnstead is above sea level along the town&#x27;s northern border, near the community of Locke&#x27;s Corner. Drained by the Suncook River, Barnstead lies fully within the Merrimack River watershed.

New Hampshire Route 28 traverses the town from north to south, connecting Alton and Wolfeboro to the north with Pittsfield and Suncook to the south. New Hampshire Route 126 begins in Center Barnstead and travels southeast to Strafford and Barrington. New Hampshire Route 107 cuts through the western corner of Barnstead, leading from Pittsfield in the south to Laconia in the north.

<doc id="124485" wikidata="Q51756" url="?curid=124485" title="China Airlines">
<text>China Airlines (CAL; ) is the state-owned flag carrier of the Republic of China (Taiwan). It is one of Taiwan&#x27;s two major airlines, along with EVA Air. It is headquartered in Taoyuan International Airport and operates over 1,400 flights weekly – including 91 pure cargo flights – to 102 cities across Asia, Europe, North America, and Oceania. Carrying nearly 20 million passengers and 5700 tons of cargo in 2017, the carrier was the 33rd largest airline in the world in terms of revenue passenger kilometers and 10th largest in terms of freight revenue ton kilometers.

China Airlines is owned by the China Airlines Group, which is headquartered at CAL Park and also operates China Airlines Cargo, a member of SkyTeam Cargo, which operates a fleet of freighter aircraft and manages its parent airline&#x27;s cargo-hold capacity. Its sister airlines include Mandarin Airlines, which operates flights to domestic and low-demand regional destinations, and Tigerair Taiwan, which is a low-cost carrier established by China Airlines and Singaporean airline group Tigerair Holdings but is now wholly owned by the China Airlines Group.

==History==

===Formation and early years (1959–1970)===
With a fleet of two PBY Amphibians, China Airlines was established on December 16, 1959, with its shares completely held by the Republic of China government. It was founded by I Fuen, a retired ROC Air Force officer, and initially concentrated on charter flights. During the 1960s, China Airlines was able to establish its first scheduled routes. In October 1962, a flight from Taipei to Hualien became the airline&#x27;s first domestic service. Later, the airline introduced international flights to South Vietnam, Hong Kong, and Japan. With the airline&#x27;s first two Boeing 707 aircraft, trans-Pacific flights to San Francisco via Tokyo were initiated on February 2, 1970. The expansion of the company&#x27;s 707 fleet also permitted more services in Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia, and North America (via Japan and Hawaii).

=== International expansion (1970–1995) ===
Following the standard utilization of the wide-body 747 on the highly profitable Trans-Pacific – United States routes, China Airlines introduced its first two 747-100s (ex-Delta Air Lines aircraft) in 1976 and immediately placed them on its Hong Kong-Taipei-Tokyo-Honolulu-Los Angeles route. Shortly thereafter, four brand new Boeing 747SPs (Special Performance) were introduced in 1977. In 1975, three years after the establishment of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, all flights between Taiwan and Japan were suspended, and not resumed until the following year. The 747SP aircraft made it possible for China Airlines to fly daily nonstop services from Taipei to its North American destinations without stopping over in Japan. It also allowed the airline to introduce flights to Saudi Arabia and South Africa. In 1979, the airline switched all operations from the smaller Taipei Songshan Airport to the newly built Chiang Kai-Shek International Airport (now Taoyuan International Airport). Following the introduction of 747-200s, the airline introduced its first European destination, Amsterdam.

In 1978, with all airlines relocating to Narita International Airport (then New Tokyo International Airport), China Airlines was the sole foreign carrier to use Haneda, which at the time was an exclusive domestic facility; the premise being that air carriers from the PRC and Taiwan were prevented from crossing paths at any Japanese airports. EVA Air joined China Airlines later on, although both eventually moved to Narita, with CAL moving on April 18, 2002.

The next 20 years saw sporadic but far-reaching growth for the company. Later, the airline inaugurated its own round-the-world flight: (Taipei-Anchorage-New York-Amsterdam-Dubai-Taipei).

On February 8, 1990, China Airlines received the first of its initial five Boeing 747-400s (B-161). 1993 saw the airline listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The new 747-400s and an earlier order with Airbus for over a dozen A300B4 and A300-600Rs wide body regional jets allowed for addition destination growth. During the 1990s, China Airlines also bought the McDonnell Douglas MD-11 and had to compete with a new competitor, EVA Air. They also founded another airline to deal with the PRC-ROC dispute which borrowed aircraft from China Airlines itself. One of China Airlines&#x27;s 747-400s (B-164) was also used by President Lee Tung-hui during his trip to the United States in June 1995.

===Change of logo and livery (1995–2010)===
As the Republic of China (Taiwan)&#x27;s flag carrier, China Airlines has been affected by disputes over the political status of Republic of China (Taiwan), is under pressure from the Chinese Communist Party, and was barred from flying into a number of countries maintaining diplomatic relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China (&quot;Mainland China&quot;). As a result, in the mid 1990s, China Airlines subsidiary Mandarin Airlines took over some of its Sydney and Vancouver international routes. Starting from October 7, 1995, partly as a way to avoid the international controversy, China Airlines unveiled its &quot;plum blossom&quot; logo, replacing the national flag which had previously appeared on the tail fins (empennage), and the aircraft livery from the red-white-blue national colours on the fuselage of its aircraft. The plum blossom (&quot;Prunus mume&quot;) is the Republic of China&#x27;s National Flower.

Throughout the 1990s, the airline employed many ex-ROC Air Force pilots. Due to the company&#x27;s poor safety record in the 1990s, China Airlines began to change its pilot recruitment practices and the company began to actively recruit civilian-trained pilots with proven track records. In addition, the company began recruiting university graduates as trainees in its own pilot training program. The company also modified its maintenance and operational procedures. These decisions were instrumental in the company&#x27;s improved safety record, culminating in the company&#x27;s recognition by the IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA).

During the 1990s and early 2000s, China Airlines placed orders for various airliners including the Airbus A330, Airbus A340, Boeing 737-800, as well as for additional 747-400s (both the passenger and freighter version).

Due to improving cross-strait relations, the first cross-strait charter flights between Taiwan and China were introduced in 2003, with China Airlines&#x27; flight 585, operated by a Boeing 747-400, being the first Taiwanese flight to legally land in China. (The aircraft took off from Taipei Chiang Kai-Shek (now Taoyuan) Airport, stopped over at Hong Kong Airport, and landed at Shanghai Pudong Airport.) In 2005, the first nonstop cross-strait charter flights were initiated, with China Airlines&#x27; flight 581 (Taoyuan Airport to Beijing Capital Airport) being the first flight of the program to depart from Taiwan. In 2008, the first regular weekend charter flights between Taiwan and China started operating, with daily charter flights introduced later in the year. In 2009, regularly scheduled cross-strait flights were finally introduced.

China Airlines signed an agreement to begin the process of joining airline alliance SkyTeam on September 14, 2010 and officially became a full member on September 28, 2011. This was marked by an update to the logo of the airline and the typeface in which &quot;China Airlines&quot; is printed. The carrier was the first Taiwanese airline to join an airline alliance.

=== 2012–present ===
Since 2012, China Airlines has participated in the Pacific Greenhouse Gases Measurement (PGGM) Project, led by the Environmental Protection Administration, Ministry of Science and Technology, and National Central University. As part of the collaboration, China Airlines installed &quot;In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS)&quot; on three aircraft: B-18806 (Airbus A340-300) in June 2012, B-18317 (Airbus A330-300) in July 2016, and B-18316 (Airbus A330-300) in July 2017. B-18806 also wore &quot;The Official Airline for Climate Monitoring&quot; special livery. Between July 2012 and September 2017, the PGGM fleet collected greenhouse gases-data from a total of 4682 flights. In May 2017, B-18806 was retired. B-18316 and B-18317 are expected to continue collecting data until 2027.

In December 2013, China Airlines announced its new joint venture with Singaporean low-cost carrier Tigerair Holdings (now defunct and replaced by Budget Aviation Holdings) to establish Tigerair Taiwan. The new airline flew its inaugural flight to Singapore on September 26, 2014, and became the first, and currently only, Taiwanese low-cost carrier. Tigerair Holdings previously held 10 percent of the shares. As disputes unfolded surrounding the partnership, China Airlines Group re-negotiated with Tigerair Holdings and has now taken full ownership of Tigerair Taiwan.

In March 2014, China Airlines announced the &quot;NexGen (Next Generation)&quot; plan to complement its then-upcoming Boeing 777-300ER and Airbus A350-900 XWB. Designed to refresh the brand image of the carrier, the plan included product innovations, new uniforms, and fleet replacements. Through cooperating with designers from the Greater China region, the carrier hoped to introduce unique product offerings that could showcase the beauty of the Orient and the cultural creativity of Taiwan. The first phase of the plan has been completed. In addition to new cabin designs, also introduced were the renovated Dynasty Lounges at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport and the debut of new William Chang-designed uniforms. The new fleet types allowed the retirement of older aircraft; the A340-300 fleet was fully retired in June 2017, while the 747-400 has been fully replaced on long-haul routes. With the First Class-equipped 747s flying regionally and new long-haul aircraft not featuring First Class, China Airlines terminated First Class services in 2016. First Class seats are now sold as Business Class.

Future phases of the NexGen plan include ordering new aircraft to replace older fleet types. In May 2019, the airline announced that it will be introducing the Airbus A321neo, including 14 leased, 11 purchased, and five options, along with three orders and three options for the Boeing 777F. The A321neo will replace the Boeing 737-800 while the 777F will replace the Boeing 747-400F. Cabin design on the A321neo will continue the NexGen design ethos to provide passenger experience cohesive with that of the 777 and A350.

Focus has also been put on tapping the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) market. In January 2015, China Airlines established Taiwan Aircraft Maintenance &amp; Engineering Co. (TAMECO), an airline MRO company focusing on Boeing 737 and 777, and Airbus A320, A330, A340, and A350 XWB families&#x27; fuselage maintenance. For the project, Airbus is providing a wide range of support, one of which is inviting China Airlines to join the Airbus MRO Alliance (AMA), alongside AAR Corp, Aeroman, Sabena technics, Etihad Airways Engineering, and GAMECO. Moreover, a joint-venture agreement has been signed with Tulsa-based Nordam, specializing in nacelle, thrust reversers, and composite materials, to establish the only Nordam repair center in Asia. The first TAMECO hangar, to be completed in March 2019, will be able to accommodate 2 777/A350 and 3 737/A320 sized aircraft at the same time.

Labor-management unrest has been a major issue at China Airlines over recent years. On June 25, 2016, the Taoyuan Flight Attendants Union, representing some 2,500 cabin crew, staged the first strike in Taiwanese aviation history. A total of 122 passenger flights were cancelled during the day-long strike. During the 2019 Lunar New Year season, over 600 pilots participated in a seven-day strike by the Taoyuan Union of Pilots. Over 200 flights were cancelled between February 8 and 14.

In July 2020, the Legislative Yuan of the Republic of China passed a resolution for the Ministry of Transportation and Communications to rename the airline and redesign its liveries due to frequent confusion with Air China. The name change plans were on hold since 2022.

China Airlines has its headquarters, CAL Park (), on the grounds of Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport in Dayuan District (formerly Dayuan Township), Taoyuan City (formerly Taoyuan County). CAL Park, located at the airport entrance, forms a straight line with Terminal 1, Terminal 2, and the future Terminal 3.

Previously China Airlines had its headquarters and facilities on the east side of Taipei Songshan Airport, in the China Airlines Building on Nanjing E. Road, and at Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport. The functions were consolidated following the completion of CAL Park. The Taipei Branch Office of the airline remains at the China Airlines Building in downtown Taipei.

==Branding==

===Livery and uniforms===
Prior to introducing the current plum blossom livery in 1995, the livery of China Airlines featured the flag of Republic of China (Taiwan) on the tail due to commercial and political reasons. The common practice after the move to Taiwan in 1949 was for related enterprises to have the Taiwanese flag. In the 1990s, the airline management stated to the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; that the logo change to the flower was not because of politics. Han Cheung of the &quot;Taipei Times&quot; wrote that &quot;the change was reportedly made so that the airline could keep flying to Hong Kong after the 1997 handover to China.&quot;

In 2011, the carrier made alterations to its logo as part of refreshing the brand image which were unveiled during the SkyTeam joining ceremony on September 28. A new font was chosen for the company name and a new approach was taken for the appearance of the plum blossom trademark.

China Airlines has had many uniforms since its establishment in 1959. The current uniform was designed by Hong Kong-based costume designer William Chang and introduced in 2015 to celebrate the carrier entering a &quot;NexGen&quot; Next Generation Era.

===Marketing slogans===
China Airlines has used different slogans throughout its operational history. In 2006, the current slogan was introduced to complement the new uniforms and to celebrate its 47th anniversary. China Airlines&#x27; slogans have been as follows:

* &quot;We treasure every encounter&quot; (1987–1995)
* &quot;We blossom everyday&quot; (1995–2006)
* &quot;Journey with a caring smile&quot; (2006)
* &quot;Expect The Coming Greatness&quot; (approximately 2016), a slogan featured on marketing material distributed at the San Francisco Orchid Society&#x27;s Pacific Orchid Expedition, of which China Airlines was a sponsor. The marketing material also referenced &quot;China Airlines presents newly retrofitted Boeing 747-400.&quot;

===Name issues===
The name China Airlines reflects Taiwan&#x27;s official name, the Republic of China. This became an issue during the COVID-19 pandemic when foreign officials and the international press mistakenly identified a number of China Airlines flights repatriating Taiwanese citizens or bringing medical supplies to afflicted countries as related to the People&#x27;s Republic of China rather than the Republic of China. In April 2020, Premier Su Tseng-chang voiced support for changing the name but said that it might come at the cost of the nation&#x27;s aviation rights. The Premier announced that China Airlines would highlight Taiwan on the fuselage of planes delivering COVID-19 related medical supplies.

=== Special liveries ===

The first China Airlines special livery, the &quot;Taiwan Touch Your Heart&quot; tourism-promotional livery, was introduced in 2003. The project was a collaboration between the carrier and the Tourism Bureau of Taiwan. However, the plane was painted back to the normal livery before it left the hangar. Currently, China Airlines has a total of 9 special livery aircraft in service.

* B-18007 (Boeing 777-300ER) – World&#x27;s first co-branded Boeing 777

In 2016, China Airlines announced that the Airbus A350-900 fleet will have a naming theme that combines endemic birds and unique features of Taiwan. The first two A350s were named Mikado pheasant and Taiwan blue magpie by the airline. The names of the remaining 12 aircraft were selected by the Taiwanese public online from a total of 24 choices.

&lt;br&gt;
== Destinations ==

China Airlines currently operates over 1,400 flights weekly (including pure cargo flights) to 178 airports in 29 countries on 4 continents as of January 31, 2024 (excluding codeshare; brackets indicate future destinations). Japan is the most important market of the carrier, with over 180 flights weekly from multiple points in Taiwan to 14 Japanese destinations.

China Airlines has its largest hub at Taoyuan International Airport, which is the largest airport in Taiwan and is located near the national capital of Taipei. China Airlines operates out of both Terminal 1 and 2 at the airport. Operations to Europe, India, Korea, Hong Kong, Southeast Asia are located at Terminal 1, while those to China, Japan, North America and Oceania are located at Terminal 2. Additionally, China Airlines and its domestic subsidiary Mandarin Airlines operate numerous flights out of Kaohsiung International Airport and Taipei Songshan Airport, the downtown airport of Taipei. International flights from Songshan Airport to three Northeast Asian downtown airports, namely Tokyo–Haneda, Seoul–Gimpo, and Shanghai–Hongqiao, have important significance to the carrier, as those routes form a Northeast Asia Golden Flight Circle.

The expansion of China Airlines international presence has long been limited by the political status of Taiwan. Flights to mainland China were not permitted until 2003, when the carrier&#x27;s Chinese New Year charter flight 585 from Taipei-Taoyuan to Shanghai–Pudong via Hong Kong made China Airlines the first Taiwanese carrier to legally land in Chinese mainland and the first carrier to legally fly between the two areas after their split during the civil war. The carrier operated occasional cross-strait charter flights for another few years until 2008, when regular charters flights started. In 2009, a new air service agreement allowed China Airlines to start regularly scheduled flights to the Mainland. Since then, China has quickly become the second-largest market for China Airlines, with over 130 flights to 33 destinations across the Mainland.

In September 2022, China Airlines announced the resumption of flights to Bali, the popular Indonesian tourist destination as the travel industry started recovering from the COVID-19 impact.

=== Route plans ===
Between 2011 and 2015, China Airlines focused on strengthening its regional network; starting 2015 until 2020, the carrier is strengthening and expanding its European, North American, and Oceanian network with the new long-haul fleet. After upgrading all its European routes to nonstop services, in late 2017, the carrier launched four weekly services to London Gatwick Airport. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, flights to London were routed to Heathrow Airport. Although it was planned to move back to Gatwick in March 2021, but China Airlines opted to remain serving Heathrow as their scheduled London operation. In France, as China Airlines does not have rights to operate flights to Paris, the airline cooperated with SkyTeam-partner Air France to launch nonstop flights to the French capital on Air France&#x27;s airplanes in April 2018. China Airlines sells 40% of the seats on the flight. In July 2023, a twice-weekly service to Prague was launched. In America, daily flights were launched between Taipei and Ontario (California) International Airport in Greater Los Angeles in March 2018. Additionally, the carrier has expressed interests in launching European destinations such as Barcelona, Madrid and Warsaw; in North America, Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, Montréal, and Toronto.

Regarding its regional network, China Airlines is actively supporting the Taiwanese government&#x27;s &quot;New Southbound Policy&quot; by increasing flights to destinations in southeast Asia. On the other hand, cross-strait routes are being downsized due to tense cross-strait relations.
=== Codeshare agreements ===

===Renewal plans===
In May 2019, China Airlines announced that it will be introducing the Airbus A321neo to replace its Boeing 737-800 fleet. The airline will take delivery of 25 A321neos, including 14 leased and 11 purchased, starting in 2021. The order with Airbus also includes the option for five more of the type.

China Airlines also has options for six A350s. Decision to switch the options to firm orders will be based upon the performance of the aircraft on European nonstop routes. The airline has taken a cautious attitude towards ordering the larger A350-1000 variant due to the large capacity.

Regarding the Airbus A330-300, replacement plans have been underway since 2017. Previously in 2016, a retrofit program was announced to upgrade the in-flight products on the A330. The plan was suspended indefinitely in favor of ordering and leasing new aircraft. On August 30, 2022, the airline announced its decision to order Boeing 787-9 as the A330-300 replacement. On September 29, 2022, China Airlines made a purchase order for 16 Boeing 787-9 wide-body aircraft. On December 19, 2024, the airline ordered the Boeing 777-9 and the Airbus A350-1000 to operate the busiest long-haul routes and to replace the 777-300ER, respectively.

===Retirement plans===
In June 2017, China Airlines completed the retirement of its entire Airbus A340-300 fleet and all Boeing 747-400 delivered before 2004. It has also phased out most Boeing 737-800 delivered before 2014. The retired A340-300 and Boeing 747-400 are either stored at the aircraft boneyard at Victorville Airport or sold. All stored passenger aircraft are to be sold eventually. The last of the newer Boeing 747-400 passenger fleet with the General Electric CF6 engines was retired in March 2021.

===Cargo fleet plans===

China Airlines Cargo, the freight division of China Airlines, currently operates a fleet of 21 freighters to 33 destinations across Asia, Europe and North America. The division also utilizes the cargo space on passenger aircraft of the group. In May 2019, China Airlines signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Boeing for three orders and three options of the Boeing 777F. The 3 options were later changed to firm orders. The 777F will partially replace the 747-400F fleet. In January 2022, an order for four more 777F aircraft was placed. In August 2022, the airlines said that Airbus A350F and Boeing 777-8F are both candidates for its next-gen freighters replacing the rest of the 747-400F fleet. In December 2024, the airline ordered 4 777-8Fs to supplement the existing 777-200F fleet, as well as to completely replace the 747-400F.

Companies with a major China Airlines Group stake include:

== Incidents and accidents ==
Between 1994 and 2002, China Airlines suffered four fatal accidents, three of which each resulted in more than 200 deaths. The accidents contributed to the perception of the airline having a poor reputation for safety. Since then, the airline&#x27;s safety record has seen an improvement. In 2007, in an article published after the explosion of Flight 120, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; quoted analysts as saying the airline has had &quot;a marked improvement in safety and operational performance since 2002&quot;, with the mid-air disintegration of Flight 611 being &quot;a catalyst for an overhaul&quot; in its safety practices.

<text>Belmont is a town in Belknap County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 7,314 at the 2020 census.

The primary settlement in town, where 1,285 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as the Belmont census-designated place (CDP) and includes the densely populated portion of the town near the intersection of New Hampshire routes 106 and 140.

==History==

Originally known as &quot;Upper Gilmanton&quot;, Belmont was chartered in 1727 as a parish of Gilmanton. With water power from the Tioga River, it developed as a mill town. Built in 1833, the Gilmanton Village Manufacturing Co. made cotton and woolen textiles. Over the years it would change owners, names and products. In 1921, it was the Belmont Hosiery Co., a maker of silk, lisle and woolen stockings. It went out of business in 1955, and the renovated mill building is now a community center.

Separated from Gilmanton by an act of legislature, the town was incorporated on June 28, 1859, as Upper Gilmanton. The name Belmont was adopted in 1869 to honor August Belmont, a wealthy financier who (it was hoped) would contribute to the nascent town, but he never acknowledged the act.

In 1874, the Boston, Concord and Montreal Railroad passed through the northwestern section of Belmont, and service by the Franklin and Rochester Railroad was being planned.

The 1996–1998 adaptive reuse Belmont Mill project, federally funded through Community Development Block Grants, a major private donation, and taxpayer support, has been distinguished by regional, statewide and national awards for architectural and preservation excellence. The Belmont Mill story is featured on a New Hampshire historical marker (number 235) on nearby New Hampshire Route 140, and was cited in 2012 by the New Hampshire Preservation Alliance as one of the 25 milestone efforts of a quarter-century. The mill was added to the New Hampshire Register of Historic Places in 2014, joining the 1792 Province Road Meeting House on New Hampshire Route 107, listed since 2003. Other significant historic structures in the town include the Belmont Public Library, included on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985, and the Bandstand, cited for outstanding restoration and rehabilitation in 2015 with the Elizabeth Durfee Hengen Award from the New Hampshire Preservation Alliance.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 6.08% of the town. The highest point in Belmont is Cotton Hill, a summit near the town&#x27;s northern border. Drained by the Tioga River, Belmont lies fully within the Merrimack River watershed.

New Hampshire Route 106 passes through the town center, connecting Laconia to the north with Loudon and Concord to the south. New Hampshire Route 140 crosses NH 106 at the town center, leading to Gilmanton and Alton to the east and Tilton to the west. U.S. Route 3 and New Hampshire Route 11, forming a concurrency, pass through the northwest corner of the town along the shore of Lake Winnisquam, leading north to Laconia and southwest to Tilton and Franklin.

<text>Center Harbor is a town in Belknap County, New Hampshire, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town had a population of 1,040. It is situated between Lake Winnipesaukee and Squam Lake.

== History ==

Center Harbor separated from the town of New Hampton and was first incorporated in 1797. The town name is derived from two sources: its location, centered between Meredith and Moultonborough harbors, as well as from the Senter family, who were owners of a large amount of property in the area. The town was a landing place for lake steamers and stagecoaches, making it a popular summer resort. Center Harbor was a favorite spot of John Greenleaf Whittier, and the home of Dudley Leavitt, author of the first &quot;Farmers&#x27; Almanac&quot; in 1797. Center Harbor is the winter home of the paddle steamer MS &quot;Mount Washington&quot;, the largest boat on Lake Winnipesaukee.
Center Harbor witnessed the first intercollegiate sporting event in the United States, as Harvard defeated Yale by two lengths in the first Harvard–Yale Regatta on August 3, 1852, on Lake Winnipesaukee.

== Geography ==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 18.33% of the town. It has several miles of shoreline on Squam Lake and another mile on Lake Winnipesaukee, where its main &quot;harbor&quot; lies. The town center sits eccentrically near Center Harbor&#x27;s northeastern border, where it rises gently from the shore at the junction of New Hampshire Routes 25 and 25B. The commercial district including the town center extends for several hundred yards along NH 25 into the neighboring town of Moultonborough. The highest point in town, Sunset Hill, elevation above sea level, overlooks the town center from the west. Center Harbor lies fully within the Merrimack River watershed.
NH 25 passes through the eastern edge of town, including the town center, connecting Meredith to the south with Moultonborough to the northeast. U.S. Route 3 and NH 25 pass north–south through the western part of town, connecting Meredith to the south with Holderness to the northwest. NH 25B leads from the town center west to US 3 and NH 25, forming a shortcut for through travelers on NH 25.

The Proctor Wildlife Sanctuary, owned by the Audubon Society of New Hampshire, occupies of woodlands northwest of the town center. Adjacent to this property is Center Harbor Woods, a conservation area owned by the Lakes Region Conservation Trust and protected by a conservation easement held by the Squam Lakes Conservation Society and the town of Center Harbor. The two properties abut a third conservation property in neighboring Moultonborough, resulting in a block of protected woodland comprising nearly .

<text>Gilford is a town in Belknap County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 7,699 at the 2020 census, up from 7,126 at the 2010 census. Situated on Lake Winnipesaukee, Gilford is home to Governors Island, Ellacoya State Beach, Belknap Mountain State Forest, Gunstock Mountain Resort, and the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion, a seasonal outdoor concert venue. The lakeside village of Glendale lies within Gilford&#x27;s borders.

==History==
Settled in 1778 and originally a part of Gilmanton, the town was first called Gunstock Parish. In 1812, Captain Lemuel B. Mason, who had fought in the 1781 Battle of Guilford Court House in North Carolina during the Revolutionary War and subsequently retired to Gunstock Parish, successfully proposed incorporation of a new town to be named Guilford after that battle. The name would later be contracted by clerical error. The original parish name is used by Gunstock Mountain and the ski resort located on it.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 27.56% of the town. Belknap Mountain, elevation above sea level and the highest point in Gilford as well as Belknap County, is in the south. Much of the town is drained by the Gunstock River, a tributary of Lake Winnipesaukee. Gilford lies fully within the Merrimack River watershed.

New Hampshire Route 11 crosses the town from east to west, connecting Alton and Rochester to the east with Laconia to the west. NH 11 joins U.S. Route 3 near the western border of Gilford, and together they turn south on the Laconia Bypass, which is largely within the Gilford town limits, traveling southwest towards Tilton and Franklin. New Hampshire Route 11A is an alternate east–west route to NH 11, passing through the center of Gilford and by the entrance to Gunstock Mountain Resort. New Hampshire Route 11B leaves NH 11 near Sanders Bay on Lake Winnipesaukee and proceeds northwest to Weirs Beach in Laconia.

<text>Gilmanton is a town in Belknap County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 3,945 at the 2020 census. Gilmanton includes the villages of Gilmanton Corners and Gilmanton Ironworks. The town became well known in the 1950s after it was rumored that the popular novel &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, written by resident Grace Metalious, was based on the town.

==History==
Gilmanton was incorporated in 1727. First known as &quot;Gilmantown&quot;, the town was home to the Gilman family, originally settled at Exeter. Twenty-four members of the Gilman family received land grants in the new town of Gilmanton. (Other families related to the Gilmans also received grants in the new town, including the Dudleys, the Leavitts, the Folsoms and the Coffins.) At one time it was the second-largest town in the state, following Portsmouth. The original town was larger than it is now, with villages and parishes including Belmont, Gunstock Parish (Gilford), Hurricane, Tioga, Factory Village and Lakeport. A parish first called &quot;Averytown&quot;, the site of an unprofitable iron-mining enterprise, is still known as Gilmanton Iron Works.

Gilmanton Academy was incorporated in 1794 as &quot;...one of the three academies first founded in the state...&quot;. In 1808 the original building burned; the second building also burned, in 1894, and was replaced with the current building, which now houses the town offices.

Gilmanton Theological Seminary was provided for by the terms of the original charter of Gilmanton Academy. Rev. Heman Rood, from New Milford, Connecticut, was the first professor in 1835. By 1841 a large, three-story brick building designed by Ammi B. Young was completed for the seminary&#x27;s use.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 2.89% of the town. A natural resources inventory published in 2004 noted the town&#x27;s nine town forests and other dry and wetland protected areas as well as significant plant species. The highest point in Gilmanton is Mount Mack, at above sea level, on the town line with Gilford. Crystal Lake is in the east, and Shellcamp Pond is in the west. Gilmanton lies fully within the Merrimack River watershed.

The town is served by four state routes: 106, 129, 107 and 140. Route 107 is part of Old Province Road, an important road in New Hampshire&#x27;s early history, and Route 106 is a well-traveled connection between Laconia and Concord. Route 140 is an east-west highway leading from Tilton to Alton. The intersection NH 107 and NH 140 is at Gilmanton Corners, one of the two major villages. Gilmanton Corner (or simply &quot;Gilmanton&quot;, as shown on topographic maps) is the location of several historic buildings, including Gilmanton Academy and Centre Congregational Church. Gilmanton Ironworks is located in the eastern part of town along NH 140, near the outlet of Crystal Lake.

<doc id="124490" wikidata="Q457174" url="?curid=124490" title="Workaround">
<text>A workaround is a bypass of a recognized problem or limitation in a system or policy. A workaround is typically a temporary fix that implies that a genuine solution to the problem is needed. But workarounds are frequently as creative as true solutions, involving outside the box thinking in their creation.

Typically they are considered brittle in that they will not respond well to further pressure from a system beyond the original design. In implementing a workaround it is important to flag the change so as to later implement a proper solution.

Placing pressure on a workaround may result in later system failures. For example, in computer programming workarounds are often used to address a problem or anti-pattern in a library, such as an incorrect return value. When the library is changed, the workaround may break the overall program functionality, effectively becoming an anti-pattern, since it may expect the older, wrong behaviour from the library.

Workarounds can also be a useful source of ideas for improvement of products or services.

== Legal workarounds ==

When the legal system places an obstacle in the form of a restriction or requirement, the law may provide a possible workaround. Laws intended to tap into what may seem to be deep pockets may lead to what are at least
temporary solutions such as:
* Since &quot;most French workplace laws affect businesses with 50 or more employees... many French companies opt to employ only 49 people in avoidance of crippling legislations.&quot;
* An injunction against Microsoft regarding XML features and an &quot;easy technical workaround&quot;, a patent attorney suggested having two versions of MS Word, one with and one without the feature.

=== Acronyms ===

Some well-known acronyms were created to work around bureaucratic or contracting restrictions:
* PDP - The term was used to describe a computer by another name, due to contracting complications for purchasing or leasing computers. The term PDP (Programmed Data Processor or Programmable Data Processor) was a workaround. The name &quot;PDP&quot; intentionally avoids the use of the term &quot;computer&quot;. PDPs were aimed at a market that could not afford larger computers.
* GNU - GNU&#x27;s Not UNIX. As AT&amp;T&#x27;s prices for academic licensing and use of UNIX increased, new restrictions on maximum number of concurrent users and limitations on types of use created a motivation for an alternative: a work-alike workaround. Among the better known ones are:
** Linux
** BSD
** System V
* PSAP. By contrast with hearing aids, the sale of which is more regulated and more expensive, a Personal Sound Amplification Product (PSAP) is lower in price albeit more limited in capability.

== See also ==

* Bug
* Coping skill
* Design around, to design or invent an alternative to a patented invention that does not infringe the patent&#x27;s claims
* Hack
* Jury rig
* Kludge
* Planned obsolescence
* Preventive maintenance
* Program temporary fix (PTF)

<text>Laconia ( ) is a city in Belknap County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 16,871 at the 2020 census, up from 15,951 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Belknap County. Laconia, situated between Lake Winnipesaukee and Lake Winnisquam, includes the villages of Lakeport and Weirs Beach. Each June, the city hosts Laconia Motorcycle Week, also known as &quot;Bike Week,&quot; one of the country&#x27;s largest motorcycle rallies.

==Name==
Laconia is named after the Greek region of Laconia (Greek: Λακωνία, &quot;Lakonía&quot;, Greek pronunciation: [lakoˈni.a]) in the southeastern part of the Peloponnese peninsula.

== History ==
A large Abenaki Indian settlement called Aquadoctan once existed at the point now known as The Weirs, named by colonists for fishing weirs discovered at the outlet of the Winnipesaukee River. Early explorers had hoped to follow the Piscataqua River north to Lake Champlain in search of the great lakes and rivers of Canada mentioned in Indian folklore. About 1652, the Endicott surveying party visited the area, an event commemorated by Endicott Rock, a local landmark. A fort would be built at Laconia in 1746. But ongoing hostilities between the English, French, and their respective Native American allies prevented settlement until 1761, after which it remained for many years a part of Meredith and Gilford called Meredith Bridge.

Beginning in 1765, lumber and grist mills were established on Mill Street, with taverns built soon thereafter on Parade Street. About 1822, the courthouse was built, which would become county seat at the creation of Belknap County in 1840. In 1823, the Belknap Mill was built to manufacture textiles; in operation by 1828, the structure is today a museum listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is the oldest unaltered brick textile mill in the country. Local industry produced lumber, textiles, shoes, hosiery, knitting machinery and needles. But the city&#x27;s largest employer would be the Laconia Car Company, builder of rail, trolley and subway cars. Started in 1848, it lasted until the 1930s. The railroad entered town in 1849, carrying both freight and an increasing number of summer tourists to popular Weirs Beach.

In 1855, Laconia was incorporated as a town from land in Meredith Bridge, Lakeport, Weirs and part of Gilmanton. The name was probably derived from the old Laconia Company, formed by Captain John Mason and the Masonian Proprietors to sell parcels of land during the colonial era. The Great Fire of 1860 destroyed most of Main Street from Mill to Water streets, followed by the Great Lakeport Fire of 1903, a blaze so fierce that fire companies were brought by train from as far away as Dover. Laconia was incorporated as a city in 1893.

== Geography ==
Laconia is located northwest of the geographic center of Belknap County. The city lies at the center of New Hampshire&#x27;s Lakes Region, and all or part of four major bodies of water lie within its limits: Lake Winnipesaukee, Lake Winnisquam, Opechee Bay and Paugus Bay (sometimes counted as an arm of Winnipesaukee, but historically a separate body of water).

Laconia contains three main villages. Downtown Laconia, where the Belknap County Courthouse is located, can be found in the southern tip of the city, along the Winnipesaukee River between Opechee Bay to the north and Lake Winnisquam to the southwest. Lakeport, located between Opeechee Bay and Paugus Bay, is near the geographic center of the city. Weirs Beach, around the channel connecting Paugus Bay with Lake Winnipesaukee, lies at the northern edge of the city.

U.S. Route 3 passes through parts of the city, bypassing downtown but passing through Weirs Beach. New Hampshire Route 11 bypasses the city in a concurrency with US 3. The two highways lead southwest from Laconia to Tilton and Franklin. New Hampshire Route 11A represents the old routes 11 and 3 through downtown as Court Street and Union Avenue, but then turns east on Gilford Avenue to lead to Gilford and West Alton. New Hampshire Route 106 runs north-south through downtown, leading south to Concord and north to Meredith. New Hampshire Route 107 leads southeast from downtown towards Gilmanton and Pittsfield. Route 107 turns north in downtown and follows Union Avenue (former Route 3) to a junction with US 3 near the north end of the Laconia Bypass. US 3 continues north along the east shore of Paugus Bay, through Weirs Beach and into Meredith. Route 11 leads east from the Laconia Bypass past Glendale and into Alton. New Hampshire Route 11B leads east from Weirs Beach into Gilford.

The former Boston and Maine Railroad White Mountain Branch, originally built as the Boston, Concord &amp; Montreal Railroad, enters Laconia at the Belmont town line near Lake Winnisquam and runs north through the city, through Lakeport and along Paugus Bay to Weirs Beach and Meredith. Purchased by the State of New Hampshire in 1975, the tracks are actively used for freight purposes by the New England Southern Railroad and for tourist train service by the Plymouth &amp; Lincoln Railroad between Meredith and Lakeport, with occasional service out of Laconia. The line is also a vital active link to the National rail network for the tourist operator to ship and receive equipment for their own use and also to perform contract work at the railroad&#x27;s Lincoln repair shops.

Laconia Municipal Airport is located just east of the city limits in Gilford.

A recreational trail called the W.O.W. Trail (Winnipesaukee–Opechee–Winnisquam) links several parts of the city, following the railroad tracks from Lake Winnisquam, skirting the downtown area, and running to Lakeport. A desire to extend the trail to Weirs Beach has been contested by residents in private communities abutting the rail corridor. The proposed removal of active rail for said extension is contested also by railroad companies actively using the tracks and the State of New Hampshire Bureau of Rail and Transit.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 23.93% of the city. Laconia is drained by the Winnipesaukee River. It is bounded in the southwest by Lake Winnisquam, and by Lake Winnipesaukee in the northeast. Laconia lies fully within the Merrimack River watershed. The highest point in Laconia is a hill in the northern part of the city, west of Paugus Bay&#x27;s Pickerel Cove and just east of Route 106.

Twelve of the grantees were named Sanborn, therefore the community was named &quot;Sanborntown&quot;. Among the other settlers were members of the Leavitt family, related to the Sanborns. But ongoing hostilities during the French and Indian War delayed permanent settlement until 1764. It would be incorporated by Governor John Wentworth in 1770.

There was a border adjustment to Merrimack and Strafford counties on December 24, 1828, that affected Northfield and Sanborntown. The town originally included Sanbornton Bridge, or Bridge Village, set off in 1869 as Tilton.

==Geography==

Bounded on the west by the Pemigewasset River and on the east by Lake Winnisquam, Sanbornton is largely drained by Salmon Brook, a tributary of the Pemigewasset. The highest point in town is the summit of Hersey Mountain, elevation above sea level, along the town&#x27;s northwestern border.

The town is served by Interstate 93, New Hampshire Route 132, and New Hampshire Route 127. I-93 accesses the town via Exit 22 (NH 127) and leads north to Plymouth and south to Concord. NH 132 parallels I-93 as a local road, connecting Tilton to the south with New Hampton and Ashland to the north. NH 127 intersects NH 132 in the village of Gaza within Sanbornton and leads southwest to Franklin. U.S. Route 3 crosses a very small southeastern corner of Sanbornton at the village of Winnisquam, where the road crosses Lake Winnisquam.

<text>Tilton is a town on the Winnipesaukee River in Belknap County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 3,962 at the 2020 census, up from 3,567 at the 2010 census. It includes the village of Tilton and part of the villages of Winnisquam and Lochmere. Tilton is home to the Tilton School, a private preparatory school.

== History ==
Originally the southern part of Sanbornton, the present area of Tilton was known as &quot;Sanbornton Bridge&quot; and &quot;Bridge Village&quot;. These two names refer to the bridge, built in 1763, that crossed the Winnipesaukee River from Canterbury to Sanbornton and onto what is now Main Street in Tilton. In 1869, Sanbornton Bridge was set off and incorporated as Tilton, named in honor of Nathaniel Tilton (1726–1814), whose great-grandson Charles E. Tilton (1827–1901) was the owner of textile mills and the community&#x27;s wealthiest citizen. Nathaniel Tilton established an iron foundry and the area&#x27;s first hotel, the Dexter House. Charles E. Tilton donated many statues to the town, a unique feature, and his estate is now part of the Tilton School. Tilton Hall, his former mansion built in 1861, houses the Lucian Hunt Library. The attached carriage house was renovated in 1980 to become the Helene Grant Daly Art Center.

Charles E. Tilton also donated what is perhaps the most notable landmark in the area, the hilltop Memorial Arch, located in the neighboring town of Northfield, across the Winnipesaukee River from the center of Tilton. The Roman arch replica was built in the late 1800s as a memorial to his ancestors. It is built of Concord granite, high and wide.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 6.67% of the town. Tilton is drained by the Winnipesaukee River. It is bounded on the east by Silver Lake and Lake Winnisquam.

The highest point in Tilton is above sea level, along the town&#x27;s northern border, near the summit of Calef Hill.

Tilton is served by Interstate 93, U.S. Route 3, and state routes 11, 132 and 140. Tilton is considered the gateway to the Lakes Region of the state, and a large commercial and retail district has sprung up at the intersection of the five aforementioned routes, just off Exit 20 of I-93. The historic village of Tilton is located a short distance to the west of the new commercial development, on the northern banks of the Winnipesaukee.

<text>Brookfield is a town in Carroll County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 755 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Settled in 1726 by Scots-Irish immigrants, the town was first named &quot;Coleraine&quot; after the Protestant-majority town of that name in County Londonderry in what has since become Northern Ireland. Fertile ground made it popular with farmers. It was later renamed &quot;Brookfield&quot;, after Brookfield, Massachusetts, and made a part of the town of Middleton. But in 1785 Brookfield petitioned, unsuccessfully, to be set off from Middleton. This was due to the division of the original town of Middleton into two parts by the long, high ridge of the Moose Mountains, then a considerable obstacle to travel. Town meetings, traditionally held in the muddy season of March, were particularly difficult to attend for those beyond the ridge. In 1794, however, permission was granted, and Brookfield incorporated. And in 1840, when Carroll County was set off from Strafford County, Brookfield went with Carroll, and Middleton remained with Strafford.

In 1874, the Wolfeborough Branch Railroad passed through this town.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 1.82% of the town. Brookfield is drained primarily by the Branch River and Pike Brook, within the Piscataqua River (coastal) watershed, though the western edge of the town is in the Merrimack River watershed and the northernmost tip of the town is in the Saco River watershed. Copple Crown Mountain, along the western border of Brookfield and the highest point in town, has an elevation of above sea level.

Brookfield is served by New Hampshire Route 109.

<text>Chatham is a town in Carroll County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 341 at the 2020 census. It is located in the White Mountains, and except for the southeastern corner, all of Chatham is in the White Mountain National Forest. The town is home to the Cold River national forest campgrounds.

== History ==

Chatham was granted to Peter Livins and others on February 7, 1767, by colonial Governor Benning Wentworth. The town was named in honor of William Pitt, Earl of Chatham and Prime Minister of Great Britain, who had recently led Britain to victory in the Seven Years War. Chatham was regranted in 1770 by his nephew, Governor John Wentworth, to a group including Samuel Langdon, president of Harvard College and creator of the &quot;Blanchard Map&quot; of the North Country. Part of Conway was annexed in 1829.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.96%, are water. The highest point in Chatham is the summit of South Baldface, with an elevation of above sea level. Sable Mountain, elevation , is in the west, and Robbins Ridge crosses the center of Chatham from east to west. Upper Kimball Pond is in the southeast, and Basin Pond is in the northeast. Chatham lies fully within the Saco River watershed.

An article in &quot;Statistics and Gazetteer of New-Hampshire&quot; (1875) stated, 
&quot;Carter&#x27;s Mountain rises so high between this town and Jackson as to prevent the opening of a highway, and the people of the respective towns, in their intercourse, are obliged to pass through a portion of Maine. Kiarsarge [sic], in the south-west corner of the town, has...upon the summit...a commodious house for the accommodation of visitors. The views from this mountain are grand and very extensive. In the north-west corner is Baldface Mountain. Teams can be driven nearly to its summit. From the crest of this mountain the Tip-Top House on Mount Washington can be seen, also the ocean.&quot; &quot;Kiarsarge&quot; (now Kearsarge North) and Baldface are now accessible only by hiking trails, and the summit of Kearsarge North has a lookout tower but no other structures. The views are still as extensive as before. Access to the town of Jackson continues to be partially through Maine by taking Maine State Route 113 south to the Fryeburg area, then traveling west through Conway. Route 113, leading north, crosses into New Hampshire in the North Chatham part of town, then curves back into Maine to cross the mountains in Evans Notch and descend north to U.S. Route 2 in Gilead, Maine.

North Chatham is a pene-enclave in the winter, functionally accessible to neighboring New Hampshire towns only by traveling through Maine first.

<text>Two Harbors is a city in and the county seat of Lake County, Minnesota, United States, along the shore of Lake Superior. The population was 3,633 at the 2020 census. Minnesota State Highway 61 serves as a main route in Two Harbors. Gooseberry Falls State Park is to the northeast. The city is home to a cargo shipping port for mined iron ore.

==History==

In the early years Two Harbors consisted of two separate communities, Agate Bay and Burlington. The village of Burlington along Burlington Bay was platted in 1856, first incorporated on May 23, 1857; it had a post office that operated from 1856 until 1862. The first residence constructed in Agate Bay was owned by Thomas Sexton (1854); it was a 14-by-16-foot shack. Early settlers lived in primitive conditions, which was common for both the area and time. Their homes were made of logs and had dirt floors. Diets often consisted of homegrown vegetables and animals caught in the area (at that time there were many dense forests, so deer meat was not an abundant food source). The village of Agate Bay was created with the construction camp as work on the new railroad began in 1883. The village of Two Harbors was platted in 1885 but not incorporated until 1888. Early transportation to the village was by boats under contract with the new Duluth and Iron Range Railroad, and by horse. It took one day to get from Duluth to Two Harbors. By 1886 the D&amp;IR completed the Lake Division connecting Duluth and Two Harbors with passenger service that extended to Ely. Thirty-five logging camps were set up within the vicinity, one of them on Fourth Avenue. On February 26, 1907, the village reincorporated as the City of Two Harbors.

The town&#x27;s history is included in the Lake County Historical Depot Museum.

===Whiskey Row===
By 1883 the Minnesota Iron Company had purchased all but four acres of Thomas Sexton&#x27;s land around Agate Bay. Sexton leased his remaining four acres to merchants seeking to capitalize on the 600-man workforce arriving to build the Duluth &amp; Iron Range Railroad. He divided his four acres into 32 lots. As with any frontier town of the day it was a largely male population. The infamous four-acre plot earned the nickname &quot;Whiskey Row&quot;, and was said to exist for the sole purpose of &quot;relieving a man from his pay&quot;.

Contrary to popular myth, Whiskey Row was not destroyed by a fire in 1888. There was a fire, but it occurred before the first load of ore arrived in July 1884 and only seven buildings were damaged. It was reported that the merchants affected were in Duluth the next day purchasing materials to rebuild. Whiskey Row&#x27;s demise occurred the following year.

The railroad rapidly expanded its rail and shipping operations and needed all of the shoreline for its new coal handling and storage facility. By 1885 the Minnesota Iron Company convinced Sexton to sell his remaining four acres along Agate Bay. The railroad then simply evicted the tenants and moved any of the salvageable buildings inland. There are several homes in &quot;east&quot; Two Harbors whose original structures were on Whiskey Row.

===Railroad===
Had it not been for the discovery of nearby iron ore, Two Harbors would not exist. The Minnesota Iron Company bought of land in order to build their railroad. In Agate Bay (Two Harbors) most of the land was bought from Sexton, who by that time had owned the land for 20 years.

Various locations were considered for the railroad terminus and shipping port, but Agate Bay was chosen because it was closer to the iron ore site and had a clay bottom bay, while most others were rocky.

As the track was being developed, the main transportation route was Lake Superior. This proved difficult when heavy loads such as railroad engines nearly sank the scows or tugs that carried them. The contractor John. S. Wolfe was told he would receive a bonus of $50,000 if the railroad was completed by August 1, 1884. Because that was a Friday, and construction workers had strong superstitions about Fridays, it became important that the construction be completed by July 31. On that day, the first iron ore cars left Agate Bay early in the morning, along with a caboose for President Tower to ride in on the return trip. The railway between Duluth and Two Harbors was completed in 1886.

The North Shore Scenic Railroad operates a six-hour excursion starting in Duluth that has a two-hour break in Two Harbors.

A 2-6-0 Mogul class steam locomotive with the first style of ore cars and caboose is on display by the historic Duluth and Iron Range depot.

A 2-8-8-4 Yellowstone class steam locomotive is on display at Two Harbors. It ranks among the largest steam locomotives ever built.

===Mayoral recall===
In 2022, incumbent mayor Chris Swanson was recalled; over 86% of voters voted to remove him after a series of controversies. City Council President Ben Redden has taken over the mayor&#x27;s duties pending a special election to choose a replacement.

==Industry==
Granite Gear, started in 1986, produces heavy-duty backpacks for the military and outdoors.

===Former industries===
====Cigar factories====
In 1900, John H. Kallin built Two Harbors Cigar Factory on the 100 block of 7th Street. The local trade alone required about 30,000 cigars each month. They came in eight regular brands and five specialty. In 1907 Ed Sorenson built Sorenson Cigar Factory. Neither factory is still in operation.

====Universal Fiberglass====
In 1964 the abandoned DM&amp;IR railroad buildings were used to open Universal Fiberglass. Producing three wheel mailsters for the United States Postal Service was their main contract, worth millions. Car fenders and like objects were also produced. When a fire caused enough damage that they could no longer fulfill their contract, the GSA shut them down. The property was sold at a public auction.

====Bottling works====
Two Harbors Bottling works began in 1912. It offered flavors of pop such as cream soda, ginger ale, cider, and seltzer water. The company became especially known for its strawberry pop&#x27;s unique flavor—a creamier and more natural one than the rest. This business is no longer running.

====3M====
3M, originally known as Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, was started by five men from Two Harbors. When the founders thought they had found mineral called corundum, which could be used to make sandpaper, they began setting up a mining company. The five were Henry S. Bryan, J. Danley Budd, Herman Cable, William McGonagle, and John Dwan. To get the company started they erected a large dock, crushing mill and bunk and storage houses. After selling the corundum to a company in Chicago the men learned that it wasn&#x27;t really corundum and moved on to other ventures. In 1905 the company was moved to Duluth and in 1907 to St. Paul. It still had ties in Two Harbors until Dwan&#x27;s death. Now the only tie 3M has to Two Harbors is a museum in Dwan&#x27;s original office. The museum is in 3M&#x27;s original building. Exhibits include Dwan&#x27;s recreated office and other artifacts; a history of the company including photos and documents; a &quot;lab&quot; area representing the establishment of research and development, product diversification and growth; and hands-on interactive programs and technology applications. The original office building has been restored and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Arts and culture==
===&quot;Edna G.&quot;===
Built in 1896, the &quot;Edna G&quot;. was named after the president of the railroad&#x27;s daughter, Edna Greatsinger, this tug is &quot;one of a kind&quot;. The &quot;Edna G.&quot; stayed in Two Harbors its entire working career except for a small stint during World War I it spent two years on the east coast moving warships around. Until its retirement in 1981, the &quot;Edna G.&quot; was the last coal-fired, steam-powered tugboat in operation of the Great Lakes. The boat is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Tours of this vessel are available from trained guides in the spring-fall from 10am to 5pm. A trip includes a visit to the engine room, and seeing the pilot house, where the passengers are allowed to blow the horn.

===John Beargrease===
Mok-qua Bennete, also known as John Beargrease, was an Ojibwe man who delivered mail between Two Harbors and Grand Marais. The John Beargrease Dog Sled Race was started as a tribute to him for his role in the early history of the North Shore of Lake Superior. The race covers nearly 400 miles between Duluth and Grand Portage. It is traditionally held in the last week of January.

===Other===
Two Harbors hosts the Lake County Fair and Heritage Days, and is one of the checkpoints for the Beargrease Sled Dog Marathon, as well as the starting line for Grandma&#x27;s Marathon and the NorthShore Inline Marathon. Dean L. Hovey wrote a mystery, &quot;Whistling Pines&quot; (2012), set in a fictional Two Harbors senior living center, and two sequels, &quot;Whistling Sousa&quot; (2013) and &quot;Whistling Wings&quot; (2018).

===Library===
The Two Harbors Public Library opened in 1909 as a Carnegie Library with a $15,000 grant from Andrew Carnegie. Before that, the books were shuffled from space to space in a variety of city offices. In 1983, an addition was added to the library, providing street access and a total of 8,000 square feet. The library houses over 30,000 books, magazines, CDs, audiobooks, and DVDs. The Archives Room contains photographic collections and local newspapers dating to the late 1890s. Residents of Two Harbors and the surrounding rural area are served by the library and, through the library&#x27;s membership, the Arrowhead Library System.

==Parks and recreation==
Two Harbors has five community parks. They have picnic tables, baseball, soccer, and football fields, and playground equipment. The Thomas Owens Park houses the city&#x27;s bandshell, home of the Two Harbors City Band, Minnesota&#x27;s oldest city band.

Two Harbors is the gateway city to the North Shore of Minnesota. Highway 61 is the only major highway heading north/northeast along Lake Superior&#x27;s shore and is the fastest way to the North Shore&#x27;s eight state parks, as well as wayside rests and lakeshore access. The parks are Gooseberry Falls, Split Rock Lighthouse, Tettegouche, George H. Crosby Manitou State Park, Temperance River State Park, Cascade River State Park, Judge C.R. Magney State Park, and Grand Portage State Park.

The Two Harbors area is host to numerous outdoor events each year, including the challenging Heck of the North gravel bike race.

===Trails===
Two Harbors offers access to Minnesota trails. The Sonju hiking trail can be used to view the Two Harbors shoreline. North Shore State Snowmobile Trail includes scenic views for snowmobilers, as do the Yukon Snowmobile Trail and Brimson Snowmobile Trail. There is also the Erkki Harju Ski Trail.

==Government and politics==
Lake County Search and Rescue is a division of Lake County&#x27;s Sheriff department. It was created in 1971 and placed in Two Harbors. Its formation was helped by Silver Bay Search and Rescue. Its first meeting place was a room at the depot, from which it moved to the old Svee Distributing building at 616 3rd Avenue. In 1980 it took over the former U.S. Forestry Service garage complex on 16th Avenue.

==Education==
In 1901, Two Harbors decided it needed a high school. On February 12, 1902, Two Harbors Central High School was dedicated at a cost of $35,025. It was on the 400 block of Fourth Avenue, and had 50 students and three teachers. The first students to graduate were Mary Rylander and Ann Paulson. The school taught arithmetic, grammar, and American history. Very little English was taught at the time. In 1903 Latin and music were introduced. Courses in science and sewing were added in 1906. Manual training and domestic services were introduced in 1908. By 1909 the school had 98 students and seven teachers. By 1910 the school library had 7,000 books. Plans for a new building were announced in 1935, at an estimated $100,000. The original Central High School was demolished and the new building was completed in 1939. At completion, and after all additions were made, the total cost was $585,000. A referendum for a new building two miles (3 km) north of town on Lake County Highway 2 (CR 2) was passed in 2003. Building was completed and classes began in 2005. Students use the hiking trails in the woods, around ponds, and the football field. The former high school on 4th Avenue was demolished in 2008.

<doc id="124508" wikidata="Q2430133" url="?curid=124508" title="Effingham, New Hampshire">
<text>Effingham is a town in Carroll County, New Hampshire, United States. At the 2020 census, the town population was 1,691, up from 1,465 at the 2010 census. Effingham includes the villages of Effingham Falls, Effingham (Lord&#x27;s Hill), Center Effingham (Drake&#x27;s Corner), and South Effingham. Pine River State Forest is in the south.

==History==
The town was settled by members of the Leavitt family of Hampton, New Hampshire, led by Captain John Leavitt, a soldier whose father, Moses, was a prosperous Hampton tavern keeper. From them the settlement first took the name &quot;Leavitt&#x27;s Town&quot;. In 1749, the land was granted by Governor Benning Wentworth, and he renamed it &quot;Effingham&quot; for the Howard family, who were Earls of Effingham and who were related to the Wentworths by marriage. The town was incorporated in 1778.

North Effingham was set off in 1831 and incorporated as Freedom. By 1859, when the population was 1,252, Effingham Falls had developed into a small mill town, with a woolen factory, five sawmills, three gristmills, and a carriage factory.

Per a New Hampshire historical marker, number 83: Effingham was home to the first normal school in New Hampshire, established in 1830 on the second floor of the Effingham Union Academy building, erected in 1819. James W. Bradbury, later a U.S. senator from Maine, took charge of the school only on condition that it should be for the &quot;instruction and training of teachers&quot;. The idea was his own and, at that time, entirely novel.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town of Effingham has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 2.87% of the town. Green Mountain, elevation , is the highest point in town. Effingham is drained by the Ossipee River and the Ossipee&#x27;s tributaries, the Pine and South rivers. Province Lake lies partially within the town&#x27;s borders to the south, and small portions of Ossipee Lake (Broad Bay and Berry Bay) are contained to the north. The community is bounded on the east by the Maine state line, and on the north by the Ossipee River. Effingham lies fully within the Saco River watershed. The Ossipee River subwatershed, partially in Effingham, is home to the largest stratified-drift aquifer in New Hampshire. Much of Effingham&#x27;s land serves as aquifer recharge areas.

The town is served by state routes 25 and 153.

<text>Hart&#x27;s Location is a town in Carroll County, New Hampshire, United States. Since 1948, the town has frequently been one of the first places to declare its results for the New Hampshire presidential primary and U.S. presidential elections.

The population was 68 in the 2020 census. It was incorporated in 1795. Hart&#x27;s Location maintains a board of selectmen, but is otherwise dependent on the town of Bartlett and Carroll County for services. Home to Crawford Notch State Park, which is noted for its rugged mountain beauty, the town is crossed by the Appalachian Trail.

==History==

Hart&#x27;s Location was named after Colonel John Hart of Portsmouth, New Hampshire. In 1772, the land was granted to Thomas Chadbourne, also of Portsmouth. Native Americans used a trail up the Saco River valley through Crawford Notch, and during the French and Indian Wars, many English captives were taken to Canada that way. Despite this, the pass through the White Mountains was otherwise unknown until 1771, when Timothy Nash discovered it hunting moose, and told Governor John Wentworth.

The obscure Indian trail transformed into the Coös Road, on which was built a small public house in 1793. It was abandoned, but in 1825 Samuel Willey Jr. occupied it with his wife, five children, and two hired hands. During a violent storm on August 28, 1826, they all died in a landslide known as Willey&#x27;s Slide. They fled their home and took refuge in a shelter, but it was destroyed while the house remained unscathed.

A rock outcrop uphill divided the slide, which flowed around the home and reunited below it. The door was found gaping, a bible open on the table. Their tragedy inspired the short story &quot;The Ambitious Guest&quot; (1835) by Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Mount Willey was named in their memory. The house became part of a larger inn, then burned in 1898. Today, the location is a state historic site.

In 1875, the Portland and Ogdensburg Railroad completed its line up through Crawford Notch. Passengers thrilled to traverse the Frankenstein Trestle, long and above the ravine floor, and then the Willey Brook Bridge, long and high. Later part of the Mountain Division of the Maine Central Railroad, the route is still traveled by the Conway Scenic Railroad.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.56%, are water.

The shape of Hart&#x27;s Location is unusual: about long and wide, with crooked boundaries that echo the confines of Crawford Notch, threaded by the upper Saco River and U.S. Route 302 near the centerline of the town, and pinched from both sides between steep mountains and in some areas sheer cliffs above. This anomaly is heightened on maps that show county lines: Coos County lies immediately to the east and Grafton County to the west, but Hart&#x27;s Location is part of Carroll County, though barely connected to it.

The highest point in Hart&#x27;s Location is above sea level along the town&#x27;s western boundary, beneath the summit of Mount Willey. Arethusa Falls, New Hampshire&#x27;s highest waterfall, located in the neighboring township of Livermore, is a popular hiking destination with access from U.S. Route 302 in Hart&#x27;s Location. The town lies fully within the Saco River watershed.

The town is a popular ice climbing destination in the winter months.

==Demographics==

In the 2000 census, there were 37 people, 15 households, and 10 families living there. The population density was . There were 50 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the location was 97.30% (36 people) White, with 2.70% (one person) citing themselves as from two or more races.

There were 15 households, out of which 33.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 66.7% were married couples living together, and 33.3% were non-families. 26.7% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.47 and the average family size was 3.10.

24.3% of residents were under the age of 18, 5.4% were from 18 to 24, 35.1% were from 25 to 44, 8.1% were from 45 to 64, and 27.0% were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females, there were 94.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 100.0 males.

The median household income was $41,250, and the median income for a family was $70,833. Males had a median income of $26,250 versus $28,750 for females. The per capita income for the town was $19,609. None of the population and none of the families were below the poverty line.

==Politics==

===Federal elections ===
New Hampshire law allows towns with fewer than 100 residents to open the polls at midnight and close them as soon as all registered voters have cast their ballots. Hart&#x27;s Location is one of the New Hampshire communities where the first votes are cast in the Democratic and Republican New Hampshire primaries, the first presidential primaries in the United States during each presidential election year. The tradition of first-in-the-nation voting in Hart&#x27;s Location dates back to 1948 when residents initially voted at 7 AM. In 1952, the town shifted to midnight to facilitate greater access to the polls for railroad workers. 

In 1964, Hart&#x27;s Location discontinued the practice of midnight voting. In 1996 the tradition was revived, thanks to new owners of a local inn who aimed to garner more media attention for the small town. In 2024, it was announced that the town would once again abandon the practice. Local officials cited reasons such as the increasing length of ballots, the time required for vote tallying, and new stringent voting requirements that complicate the process.

The community&#x27;s voting tradition received a nod in the 2002 third-season episode of US television program &quot;The West Wing&quot;, in an episode entitled &quot;Hartsfield&#x27;s Landing&quot;, named after a town modeled on either Hart&#x27;s Location, or its companion, Dixville Notch.

<doc id="124518" wikidata="Q680661" url="?curid=124518" title="Jackson, New Hampshire">
<text>Jackson is a town in Carroll County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,028 at the 2020 census, up from 816 at the 2010 census. Jackson is a resort area in the White Mountains. Parts of the White Mountain National Forest are in the west, north and east.

== History ==
Once consisting of several large land grants by colonial Governor John Wentworth, the town was first named &quot;New Madbury&quot;, after the seacoast town of Madbury. In 1772, a road was built through Pinkham Notch, and the area was first settled in 1778 by Benjamin Copp and his family. In 1800, the community was renamed in honor of President John Adams, who was then in office. The name &quot;Adams&quot; stuck until the town was incorporated in 1829, when Andrew Jackson, the hero of the Battle of New Orleans, was inaugurated president. Governor Benjamin Pierce, a staunch backer of President Jackson, was influential in changing the name to Jackson. Only one vote was cast against the switch. In 2021, town residents voted to rededicate the town name to honor geologist Charles Thomas Jackson (1805–1880) rather than Andrew Jackson.

In 1847, artists of the White Mountain School began arriving in Jackson to paint the scenic beauty of the White Mountains. Others would follow, and in 1858, Joshua B. Trickey opened the Jackson Falls House. The Portland &amp; Ogdensburg Railroad began service to Glen station at nearby Bartlett in the early 1870s, and several hotels were built to accommodate a growing infusion of tourists. Thorn Mountain House, built by Trickey in 1869, would evolve during the 1880s into Wentworth Hall, still in business today. Designed as a grouping of cottages around a main service building, the hotel included such amenities as a casino, built in 1886, and a hydroelectric plant, built in the 1890s. By the 1920s, 40 trains a day delivered passengers to Jackson.

The increasing use of automobiles, however, reduced travel by train, as vacationers could venture beyond the limits of rail service. Consequently, some grand 19th century hotels lost patrons and closed, although the town itself would never lose popularity. Jackson is one of the region&#x27;s most picturesque villages, famous in part for Jackson Falls and Jackson X-C, a 100 kilometer cross-country skiing trail system, rated one of the best in the world. Wildcat Mountain, with an impressive view of Mount Washington, is a popular alpine skiing destination that was purchased by Vail Resorts in 2019. Jackson is perhaps best known for its red covered bridge (the Honeymoon Bridge), built in 1876, one of the most photographed in the state.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which , or 0.06%, are water. Jackson is drained by the Ellis River and its tributary Wildcat Brook. The highest point in Jackson is above sea level on Wildcat Ridge, at the northern boundary of town. The ridge continues to rise north of the town border to the summit of Wildcat Mountain——in the neighboring township of Bean&#x27;s Purchase. Jackson lies fully within the Saco River watershed.

<text>Moultonborough is a town in Carroll County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 4,918 at the 2020 census, up from 4,044 at the 2010 census. Moultonborough is bounded in large part by Lake Winnipesaukee in the southwest and to a lesser extent by Squam Lake in the northwestern corner. The town includes the census-designated place of Suissevale and the community of Lees Mill.

==History==
The first European settlers were grantees from Hampton, New Hampshire, among whom were at least sixteen Moultons, giving the town its name. The first recorded town meeting took place on March 31, 1777, at which Jonathan Moulton was elected town clerk, among other officials elected that day. The town was incorporated on November 27, 1777. Colonel Moulton (later a brigadier general) was considered to be one of the richest men in the province at the start of the American Revolution. Moultonborough was chartered in 1763 by colonial Governor Benning Wentworth, and at the time was described as being near the &quot;Winnepisseoky Pond&quot;. It was officially incorporated in 1777.

Moultonborough is home to the &quot;Castle in the Clouds&quot;, an estate set in the Ossipee Mountains. Thomas Gustave Plant made a fortune manufacturing shoes, bought and hired the Boston architectural firm of J. Williams Beal &amp; Sons to design &quot;Lucknow&quot;, a stone mansion built between 1913 and 1914. The property, with sweeping views of Lake Winnipesaukee, is a popular tourist attraction.

The town is also the location of the first known bear attack in Northern America. In August 1784, a heartbreaking incident occurred. An eight-year-old boy, son of a Mr. Leach, was attacked by a bear while tending to horses and cows in a pasture. His father, hearing his cries, rushed to the scene but was unable to save his child. The bear dragged the boy into the bushes, and the father&#x27;s attempts to defend him were in vain. The family spent a distressing night, and the next morning, neighbors joined in the search, finding the child&#x27;s hat and tracking his blood. Tragically, they discovered the boy&#x27;s mangled corpse. As they mourned, the bear unexpectedly reappeared, prompting three individuals to shoot and kill it. A fire was then ignited to dispose of the bear&#x27;s remains. 

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 20.50% of the town. A large portion of the town is located along Lake Winnipesaukee, the largest lake in New Hampshire. Moultonborough Bay, an arm of the lake, extends from the southern corner of the town towards the center of the town. Moultonborough Neck forms a peninsula between Moultonborough Bay and Center Harbor to the southwest. Long Island, the largest island in Lake Winnipesaukee, is connected to Moultonborough Neck by a bridge. The community of Suissevale, a census-designated place, occupies part of the northeastern shore of Moultonborough Bay. Inland from Winnipesaukee, Lake Kanasatka is in the western part of the town. Red Hill, elevation , is in the northwest. Mount Shaw, elevation , part of the Ossipee Mountains and the highest point in Moultonborough, is in the east.

The town center of Moultonborough is located north of the head of Moultonborough Bay, at the intersection of New Hampshire Route 25 and Route 109. Route 25 is a major east-west highway in the state, connecting Meredith and Plymouth to the west with Ossipee, New Hampshire, and Portland, Maine to the east. Route 109, a local road, proceeds southeast towards Wolfeboro and northwest to Center Sandwich.
