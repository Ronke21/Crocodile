==History==
Quamba was first established in 1882 on the side track of the Great Northern Railway. Originally, the community was called &quot;Mud Creek&quot; after the creek that flows through the community and that the railroad tracks crossed; the Ojibwe population in the area, though, called the creek &quot;Basa&#x27;igani-ziibiwishenh&quot; (&quot;Creek to square Cedar Timbers&quot;), thus calling the community &quot;Basa&#x27;igani-ziibiwishenying&quot; (&quot;By the Creek to Square Cedar Timbers&quot;). When the depot was built, the name was changed to &quot;Quamba,&quot; which according to the railway officials was derived from an Indian word for &quot;mudhole&quot;; most likely the name derives from the Ottawa word: &quot;zhashkwiimbaakmigaa&quot; (fully vocalized as &quot;azhashki-wiimbaakamigaa&quot;: &quot;be a muddy hole in the ground&quot;). The community was platted in 1901 by Oric Ogilvie Whited and incorporated as a village on July 11, 1952. Its post office operated 1901–1903 and 1906–1966.

<text>Willmar ( ) is a city in, and the county seat of, Kandiyohi County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 21,015 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Agricultural expansion and the establishment of Willmar as a division point on the Great Northern Railway determined its growth. The first settlers arrived during the 1850s, attracted to the fertile land and an abundance of timber and game. The Dakota War of 1862 left the township abandoned for several years. The advent of the railroad in Kandiyohi County in 1869 brought new settlers. Many were of Swedish and Norwegian origin; residents of Scandinavian heritage are still a majority. In 1870, Leon (Chadwick) Willmar, a Belgian acting as an agent for the European bondholder of the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, purchased the title to Section 1 of Willmar Township. Willmar was established as the county seat in 1871 and was incorporated as a village in 1874 and as a city in 1901.

Willmar was the site of a bank robbery by the Machine Gun Kelly gang on July 15, 1930. They robbed the Bank of Willmar (later Otto Bremer Trust) of about $70,000 () and wounded three people.

The Willmar Memorial Auditorium, designed by architect William Ingemann, was the largest assembly hall within 70 miles when completed in 1938. It was funded by the city of Willmar and state and federal governments as a Depression-era works project. It contains several murals by Richard Haines commissioned by the Federal Art Project, and wood paneling in the oak doors by WPA artists. It is on the National Register of Historic Places.

From 1977 to 1979, Willmar was the site of the Willmar 8, a strike of female workers confronting sexual discrimination at a local bank. The story of the strike was reported in mainstream media and made into a documentary.
The music of Willmar native Bradley Joseph draws inspiration from his childhood there, and his company, Robbins Island Music, is named after a Willmar city park.

Willmar was home to the annual Sonshine Festival, a Christian music festival, from 1982 to 2014.

In 2001, the city was recognized as an &quot;All America City&quot; by the National Civic League, in part for its success as growing numbers of immigrants became part of the community.

In 2005, the city received attention from national media after several Somali-American high school students gave Willmar High School its first cross-country state championship in 20 years. The team won the state tournament and attended the Nike Nationals consecutively in 2005 and 2006. Following its success, the city gained attention from &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. Subsequently, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; ran a story on Willmar&#x27;s changing complexion and its acceptance of its new citizens.

More national attention was received when an opinion piece about immigration and Willmar by Thomas Friedman appeared in the New York Times on May 14, 2019.

<text>International Falls (sometimes referred to as I-Falls) is a city in and the county seat of Koochiching County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 5,802 at the time of the 2020 census.

International Falls is located on the Rainy River directly across from Fort Frances, Ontario, Canada. The two cities are connected by the Fort Frances–International Falls International Bridge. Voyageurs National Park is located 11 miles east of International Falls. There is a major U.S. Customs and Border Protection Port of Entry on the International Falls side of the toll bridge and a Canadian Customs entry point on the north side of the bridge.

International Falls is nicknamed the &quot;Icebox of the Nation,” with an average of 109.4 days per year with a high temperature below .

==History==
The area now known as International Falls was inhabited by many indigenous peoples. The International Falls area was well known to explorers, missionaries, and voyagers as early as the 17th century. It was not until April 1895 that the community was platted by L. A. Ogaard, a teacher and preacher for the Koochiching Company, and named Koochiching. The word “Koochiching” comes from either the Ojibwe word &quot;Gojijiing&quot; or the Cree &quot;Kocicīhk&quot;, both meaning “at the place of inlets,” referring to the neighboring Rainy Lake and River. The European inhabitants gave the names Rainy Lake and Rainy River to the nearby bodies of water because of the mist-like rain present at the falls where the lake flowed into the river.

On August 10, 1901, the village was incorporated and two years later its name was changed to International Falls in recognition of the river&#x27;s role as a border between the United States and Canada. It was incorporated as a city in 1909.

Realizing the potential for water power and mills in the area, industrialist E.W. Backus, president of the Minnesota and Ontario Paper Company in the early 20th century, built a dam on the Rainy River to power the company&#x27;s mills. Purchased by Boise Cascade Corporation in 1965, and sold to an investment group in 2003, the company remains the largest business and employer in the area. In 2013 Boise laid off 394 employees and closed down a paper machine. It then sold to Packaging Corporation of America (PCA).

===Icebox of the Nation===
International Falls has long promoted itself as the &quot;Icebox of the Nation&quot;; however, the trademark for the slogan has been challenged on several occasions by the small town of Fraser, Colorado. Officials from Fraser claimed usage since 1956, International Falls since 1948. The two towns came to an agreement in 1986, when International Falls paid Fraser $2,000 to relinquish its &quot;official&quot; claim. However, in 1996, International Falls inadvertently failed to renew its federal trademark, although it had kept its state trademark up to date. Fraser then filed to gain the federal trademark. International Falls submitted photographic proof that its 1955 Pee Wee hockey team traveled to Boston, Massachusetts with the slogan. After several years of legal battles, the United States Patent and Trademark Office officially registered the slogan with International Falls on January 29, 2008, Registration Number 3375139. Only a few days after announcing its success in the trademark battle, International Falls had a daily record low temperature of , beating a previous record of in 1967.

<text>Northome is a city located in the southwestern corner of Koochiching County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 155 at the 2020 census. The county seat is International Falls, about away.

U.S. Highway 71 and State Highways 1 and 46 meet in Northome.

==Fair==
The Northome Fairgrounds hold the annual Koochiching County Fair on the second weekend of August. It celebrated its 100th anniversary in August 2006.

Fair events include
* Mudding
* Fireworks
* &quot;Scenic Sinkhole Scramble&quot; (since 1982) - runs of a sanctioned 5k race and a &#x27;fun run&#x27; of with a stroller category
* Animal and crafts judging and a related Bear Fest parade in the city of Northome.
* The fair grounds also has the &quot;Harold Lowe Memorial Arena&quot;, a horse arena capable of hosting barrel racing and other equine activities

==History==
Northome was founded in 1903 and enjoyed a boom time early in the 20th century as a logging town. It is possible that the name &quot;Northome&quot; is derived from the Norwegian place name &quot;Norheim&quot;, which is found in four places in Norway. The name literally means north home.

By the 1930s the big white and red pines were gone and pine trees were essentially locally extirpated due to the unsustainable logging practices of the time, and farming gained importance. Many farmers relocated here from the Dust Bowl conditions in the Dakotas at that time.

The Burlington Northern Railroad had a depot in Northome until the 1980s, although passenger service discontinued in 1960. Today the abandoned railroad bed forms the &quot;Blue Ox&quot; section of a large network of snowmobile trails.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Northome is located at (47.871986, -94.280248).

There are named former townships around Northome (Bridgie, Englewood, Wildwood, etc.) but in Koochiching County all townships are unorganized. Therefore, for Census and other government purposes, the city of Northome also lends its name to the surrounding Unorganized Territory of Northome (approximately of SW Koochiching County, excluding Northome and Mizpah, with 500 people in the 2000 census).

===Economy===
Important sources of employment in the area include the Northome School, independent resorts, logging and farming, and several stores in the town, including the Shining Light Cafe.

===Wildlife===
The town is on the shores of Bartlett Lake; to the south is Island Lake, popular for fishing and swimming. The lake holds Northern Pike, crappie, perch, and bullhead. Other smaller lakes are in the area as well, together supporting a variety of fish including walleye and northern pike. Unlike most of the rest of the Lower 48 states, timber wolves (the grey wolf) were never eradicated from this area, and wolves can still be heard at night, though rarely seen. Bald eagles and black bears are commonly sighted. There have also been occasional reports of cougar sightings. This area is in the southern part of the Taiga, or boreal forest, with a mix of quaking aspen (colloquially called &quot;popple&quot;), balsam fir, northern white cedar and others, including some remaining white pine and Norway pine.

In 1972 they were forced to stop and charged with violating the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, which prohibited the dumping of harmful materials into interstate waters. In 1977, after a long trial, a new waste-storage facility was built 7 miles inland. Often referred to as “Mile Post 7”

In 2015, the taconite tailing-rich Black Beach opened to the public, the negotiation with the mining company for public access to the beaches in the area being brokered by the city of Silver Bay and the state DNR. Black Beach Park contains three beaches and a municipally-owned campground.

<doc id="120564" wikidata="Q1004423" url="?curid=120564" title="Kasota, Minnesota">
<text>Kasota is a city within the larger Kasota Township, Le Sueur County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 714 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Kasota is about halfway between Mankato and St. Peter on the eastern side of the Minnesota River. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , all land. The city center is about two miles north of the Kasota Prairie, designated as a Scientific and Natural Area by the state Department of Natural Resources.

Minnesota State Highway 22 serves as a main route in the community. U.S. Route 169 is nearby, on the western side of the Minnesota River.

==History==
Kasota was platted in 1855. &quot;Kasota&quot; is a name derived from the Dakota language word for &quot;cleared off&quot;.

On July 1, 1892, the Sontag Brothers, John Sontag and George Contant, and their partner in crime, Chris Evans, tried to rob a train between St. Peter and Kasota along the Minnesota River. The bandits acquired nothing of value, but their activities came under the review of Pinkerton detectives, and both were apprehended in June 1893.

===The stone industry===
During the 1880s, the stone industry experienced an unexpected boom. During this time, C.W. Babcock took over his father&#x27;s stone business. He began applying modern quarrying methods, and in 1889 formed a partnership with Tyrrell Swan Willcox, an immigrant from Rugby, England, who was instrumental in promoting the use of polished Kasota limestone for interior and exterior residential use. Much of the industry&#x27;s boom was caused by the railroads&#x27; expansion westward, which required large quantities of stone for trestles and culverts.

Babcock also was the first to begin quarrying Kasota limestone in and around the city of Kasota. The Babcock Company was the chief stone company during the city&#x27;s early history, and the relationship between the company and the city was often contentions. At one point, the Babcock Company decided to blast within the city limits. This led to the creation of the park on County Road 21 in the town center, after the company was forced to fill in the quarry near the homes of city residents.

In the early 1980s, the Babcock Company went bankrupt. The Vetter Stone Company bought the Babcock quarries, further expanding the business, which now operates just outside the Mankato city limits. The Vetters were former employees of the Babcock Company who left to start their own company in the 1950s. The former Babcock Company plant in Kasota is now occupied by Door Engineering, which manufactures industrial doors. Much of the former Kasota quarry is occupied by Unimin Corporation, which mines silica sand for hydraulic fracturing (&quot;fracking&quot;).

Kasota stone was selected as the primary stone for building the National Museum of the American Indian and the Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art in Indianapolis.

===Namesakes===
Kasota (Dakota for &quot;a cleared place&quot;) was the name of a wooden Great Lakes iron ore steamer, built in 1884. The &quot;Kasota&quot; sank after colliding with the passenger steamer &quot;The City of Detroit&quot; on the Detroit River on July 18, 1890. The &quot;Kasota&quot; was salvaged and rebuilt in 1892 but sank again after springing a leak during a storm off Grand Marais, Michigan, on September 19, 1903.

The USS &quot;Kasota&quot; was a naval tugboat, launched in 1944 and struck from the Navy list in 1961. It is believed that the &quot;Kasota&quot; (also known as the &quot;Mighty Deuces&quot;) was the last wooden hull tug in the Navy at the time.

==Arts and culture==
Montgomery celebrates its Czechoslovakian heritage annually at the end of July with one of Minnesota&#x27;s oldest festivals, Kolacky Days. The festival dates back to 1929, when an estimated 6,000 people visited Montgomery for the first Kolacky Day celebration, held on October 1.

&quot;The Kolacky Day spirit reigned supreme from early Tuesday morning until a comparatively late hour Wednesday morning. More than 1,600 of the celebrated delicacies were devoured,&quot; according to a &quot;Montgomery Messenger&quot; account from the following week.

Events at the first celebration included a trap shooting tournament, a parade, sports and races, and a football game between Montgomery and Le Sueur Center (now Le Center).

In 1931 Miss Leatta Ehmke (later Leatta Trnka) was crowned the first Kolacky Queen by Mayor Henry Westerman. For the 1934 celebration, a novelty button, sold by the Kolacky girls, was devised and is still in use today. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Kolacky Day retreated to the background until the Montgomery Community Club revived the celebration in 1948. Kolacky Day officially became a summer festival in 1966 when the traditional date, the last Sunday in September, was dropped in favor of the first weekend in August. The earlier date and warmer weather brought huge crowds to the festival. In 1975, Kolacky Day became Kolacky Days and the event was held for the first time at the end of July. It is now celebrated on the fourth full weekend of that month. The shift was made at the urging of the Green Giant vegetable canning company, to avoid conflict with the busy corn-processing season.

Other annual events include the Torchlight Parade &amp; Fireworks, the Masopust Festival also known as &quot;The Czech Mardi Gras&quot; and the Miss Czech-Slovak MN Pageant.

<text>Amiret Township is a township in Lyon County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 230 at the 2000 census.

==History==
Historically the Native American tribe that inhabited the area were the Dakota people, specifically the Wahpekute Dakota.  The Wahpekute Dakota resided primarily along the Minnesota River Valley and its tributaries, including areas within Lyon County.

The first white settlers arrived in Amiret Township in 1868, with Charles and Lafayette Grover staking their claims. James Mitchell followed suit in 1869, establishing a presence in the area. The township was officially organized on March 19, 1874, initially named &quot;Madison Township.&quot; The name, however, proved short-lived. In 1879, it was renamed &quot;Amiret Township&quot; in honor of Amiretta Sykes, the wife of a prominent railroad official, M.L. Sykes.

The construction of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway (later known as the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company) through the county in 1872 played a pivotal role in Amiret Township&#x27;s development. A village sprang up around the railroad station, initially called &quot;Saratoga&quot; (located about three miles southwest of present-day Amiret). The post office, established in 1873, was first named &quot;Coburg&quot; after William Coburn, a pioneer merchant and the first postmaster. The village and township continued to grow throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, primarily centered around agriculture.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , all land.

Lyon County itself falls within the Dissected Till Plains ecoregion. This region is characterized by rolling hills that were formed by glaciers during the last ice age. Melting glaciers left behind numerous lakes and wetlands dotting the landscape. The Minnesota River and its tributaries carve through the region, shaping the terrain and providing water sources.

<text>Marshall is a city in Lyon County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 13,628 at the 2020 census, and 13,906 as of 2023 estimates. Marshall is a regional center in southwest Minnesota, and the county seat of Lyon County. It is the headquarters of the Schwan Food Company and the home of Southwest Minnesota State University.

==History==
Marshall was platted in 1872 when the railroad was extended to that point. Lake Marshall Township had been established in the area two years earlier, and included a post office and several farms. Before that, the site was occasionally used as a campground for groups of Dakota, who hunted and traveled throughout the region. After much discussion, James J. Manton decided on Marshall in honor of Governor William R. Marshall.

The town grew rapidly. In 1873, Samuel Biglari published Marshall&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Prairie Schooner&quot;. In the October 25, 1873, issue, he wrote, &quot;Nine months ago the first house was erected. Now there are 79 permanent buildings already constructed, and this number will be increased by others already planned.&quot; Marshall became an incorporated village in 1876 and a city on February 20, 1901. In April 1874, the local paper estimated Marshall&#x27;s population at 300; by 1900 the population was 2,088. Holy Redeemer Catholic Church was built in 1884. The Weiner Memorial Hospital was built in 1950. Also during the 1950s, Marvin Schwan transformed his dairy into an ice-cream home-delivery service, which eventually grew into the Schwan Food Company.

The flooding of the Redwood River had historically been a problem in Marshall. The city experienced a series of floods in the 1940s and 1950s. Diversion canals were constructed between 1961 and 1963, but occasional flooding still occurs, notably in 1993. Another project in 1997 removed of sediment from the diversion channel. The diversion channel and Redwood River underwent major upstream and downstream improvements, completed in December 2000. During the spring and fall of 2010, the Marshall area experienced unseasonably high amounts of moisture, but the Redwood River remained within its banks through town.

Southwest Minnesota State University was founded in 1963 and opened in 1967. Most of the campus was constructed between 1967 and 1973.

==Geography==
Marshall is situated at latitude 44.47N and longitude -95.78W, with an elevation of above sea level. The city is northeast of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and southwest of Minneapolis.

<text>William Ormond Mitchell, (March 13, 1914 – February 25, 1998) was a Canadian writer and broadcaster. His &quot;best-loved&quot; novel is &quot;Who Has Seen the Wind&quot; (1947), which portrays life on the Canadian Prairies from the point of view of a small boy and sold almost a million copies in Canada. As a broadcaster, he is known for his radio series &quot;Jake and the Kid&quot;, which aired on CBC Radio between 1950 and 1956 and was also about life on the Prairies.

==Early life and career==
W. O. Mitchell was born in Weyburn, Saskatchewan. He studied psychology and philosophy at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg and then completed his BA and a teaching certificate at the University of Alberta in 1943. While at the University of Alberta, Mitchell became a brother of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Delta Phi chapter).

An author of novels, short stories, and plays, Mitchell is best known for his 1947 novel, &quot;Who Has Seen The Wind&quot;, which has sold close to a million copies in North America, and the radio series and later a collection of short stories 1961, &quot;Jake and the Kid&quot;, which subsequently won the Stephen Leacock Award. Both of these portray life on the Canadian Prairies where he grew up in the early part of the 20th century. He has often been called the Mark Twain of Canada for his vivid tales of young boys&#x27; adventures.

In 1942, while Mitchell was teaching high school, three of his short stories were published. In 1947 his first and trademark novel &quot;Who Has Seen the Wind&quot; was published to critical acclaim and commercial success. In 1948 Mitchell moved to Toronto, Ontario to become the fiction editor for &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine. While residing in Toronto, Mitchell created &quot;Jake and the Kid&quot;, a weekly radio series for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation whose 320 episodes ran from 1950 to 1956. These productions were produced by Swedish immigrant CBC Radio head, Esse W. Ljungh.

In addition to producing a large body of work, Mitchell served as professor of creative writing and writer-in-residence at several Canadian universities and was the director of the Banff Centre&#x27;s writing division. In 1974 he returned to Winnipeg, where he served a term as Writer in Residence at the Winnipeg School Division No.1 and was given an honorary doctorate by Brandon University. Mitchell spent his later years in Calgary, Alberta, dying there in 1998.

==Awards and honours==
In 1973, Mitchell was made an officer of the Order of Canada. The list of other honours Mitchell has received includes honorary doctorates from five Canadian universities and being sworn in as a Member of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada on November 5, 1992. In 2000, Mitchell was honoured by the government of Canada with his image on a postage stamp.

Mitchell has had schools named after him in Calgary (W.O. Mitchell School) and Kanata, Ontario (W. O. Mitchell Elementary School).

==History==
A post office called Bejou has been in operation since 1906.

However, these two words are linguistic false friends, and are not etymologically related. The town&#x27;s name likely comes from the Ojibwe word &quot;bizhiw&quot; meaning &quot;lynx&quot;, a type of cat indigenous to North America, and one of the doodems of the Ojibwe people.

Bejou is in northwestern Mahnomen County along U.S. Route 59, which leads south to Mahnomen, the county seat, and north to Erskine.
