<text>Georgetown is a home rule-class city in Scott County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 37,086 at the 2020 census. It is the sixth-most populous city in Kentucky. It is the seat of its county. It was originally called Lebanon when founded by Rev. Elijah Craig and was renamed in 1790 in honor of President George Washington. Historically, settlers were drawn to Georgetown for its Royal Spring.

It is the home of Georgetown College, a private liberal arts college. Georgetown is part of the Lexington-Fayette, KY Metropolitan Statistical Area. At one time the city served as the training camp home for the NFL&#x27;s Cincinnati Bengals.

The city&#x27;s growth began in the mid-1980s, when Toyota built Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky, its first wholly owned United States plant, in Georgetown. The plant opened in 1988; it builds the Camry, Camry Hybrid, Lexus ES, and RAV4 Hybrid automobiles.

==History==
Native peoples have lived along the banks of Elkhorn Creek in what is now Scott County for at least 15,000 years. At the time of European encounter, the historic Shawnee people occupied this area.

Anglo-American exploration can be dated to the late colonial period and a June 1774 surveying expedition from Fincastle County, Virginia, led by Colonel John Floyd. For his military service, he was granted a claim of in the area by the state of Virginia. He named it Royal Spring but did not settle it. John McClellan was the first English colonist to settle the area and established McClellan&#x27;s Station there in 1775, but the compound was abandoned following an Indian attack on December 29, 1776.

In 1782, the Baptist preacher Elijah Craig led his congregation to the site from Orange County, Virginia, and established a new settlement which he called Lebanon. This was incorporated by the Virginia legislature in 1784. At the time, Virginia claimed this territory under its colonial charter. Craig established some of the first mills west of the Appalachian Mountains along the Royal Spring Branch, where he also manufactured cloth and paper. He also founded a distillery in 1789, as well as a school called the Rittenhouse Academy. This eventually developed as Georgetown College.

The city&#x27;s name was changed to George Town in honor of President George Washington in 1790. When Kentucky became the 15th U.S. state in 1792 and formed Scott County, George Town became the county seat. Its name was formally changed to Georgetown in 1846.

The county developed an agricultural economy, as it was part of the fertile Bluegrass Region. Planters cultivated tobacco and hemp, and raised blooded livestock, including Thoroughbred racehorses, and cattle and sheep. During the Civil War, Kentucky stayed in the Union. Georgetown was raided by Confederate Gen. John Hunt Morgan twice, once on July 15, 1862, and the second time on July 10, 1864.

Following the war, the town became a railroad hub, connected to the Cincinnati Southern, the Louisville Southern, and the Frankfort &amp; Cincinnati. The last was considered the &quot;whiskey route&quot; and carried much of the region&#x27;s bourbon to markets along the Ohio River.

In 1896 a girl&#x27;s academy was founded by the Catholic Sisters of Visitation. The school closed in 1987, and was adapted as the Cardome Centre. It previously served as a community center for the city of Georgetown, but was purchased by the Catholic Diocese of Lexington in 2019.

===20th century to present===
Throughout the 20th century, Georgetown has been in transition from an economy based primarily on agriculture, to one mixing manufacturing, small business, and the family farm. During the 1960s, the construction of Interstate 75 placed the city on one of the nation&#x27;s busiest highways. The selection of Georgetown as the site of Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky in 1985 has resulted in the greatest period of growth in the city&#x27;s history.

The historic Ward Hall, now home to The Ward Hall Preservation Foundation, is located just outside Georgetown. Ward Hall was the summer home of Junius Ward. The home represents the height of the Greek Revival period of architecture in Kentucky and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

The Georgetown business section has a historic district known as the Oxford Historic District. It is also listed on the NRHP.

<text>Shelbyville is a home rule-class city in and the county seat of Shelby County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 17,282 at the 2020 census.

==History==

===Early history===
The town of Shelbyville was established in October 1792 at the first meeting of the Shelby County Court after local landowner William Shannon agreed to surrender of his property to the community and provide 1 free acre for public buildings. As a result of the grant, Shelbyville, rather than the nearby Squire Boone&#x27;s Station, became the home of Shelby County. The agricultural town was situated on the western bank of Clear Creek at the confluence of Mulberry Creek and near a road between Louisville and Frankfort. The town required new residents to construct a 1½-story log cabin with a stone chimney; by 1795, there were 40 of these and, by 1800, there were 262 residents residing in Shelbyville. New lots were platted in 1803, 1815, and 1816.

The Shelbyville Academy was established in 1798 at Eighth and Washington; it became Shelby College and moved to College Street in 1836, affiliated with the Episcopal Church in 1841, changed its name to the St. James College after the Civil War, and closed in 1871, replaced by a public elementary school. The Science Hill Female Academy was established in 1825 on Washington Street; it functioned as a college preparatory school for young women throughout the South prior to closing in 1939 at the end of the Great Depression. The Shelbyville Female Seminary was established in 1839 and moved to its longtime residence at Seventh and Main in 1846. It became the Shelbyville Female Institute in 1849, the Presbyterian Stuart&#x27;s Female College in 1851, the Shelbyville Female College in 1868, and the Baptist Shelbyville College from 1890 until its closure in 1912.

The Louisville and Shelbyville Turnpike was completed in the 1830s, following a ridgeline path between the two sites dating back to the Native Americans. After the Louisville and Frankfort Railroad was constructed near the road in present-day Cherokee Gardens in 1849, the turnpike company rerouted and constructed a new road nearby (originally known as the &quot;Shelbyville Branch&quot;, now Lexington Avenue in Louisville) which was completed in 1851.

===Civil War===
Late in the Civil War, on August 24, 1864, Confederate guerillas under local sympathizer Capt. Dave Martin attacked the Shelby County Courthouse, attempting to seize its cache of muskets. The local merchant Thomas McGrath and tailor J.H. Masonheimer fought them off, killing three of Martin&#x27;s men. A black man named Owen was also killed in the exchange, having been forced to hold the guerillas&#x27; horses for them. Martin himself missed the gunfight, as he was held up outside the jail behind the courthouse when the jailer&#x27;s wife Mrs. Burnett began furiously scolding him for endangering the lives of innocent townspeople including Martin&#x27;s own wife and children. Following the raid, the trustees required all white male residents over the age of 18 to serve as police guards, erecting a blockhouse at Fifth and Main in front of the courthouse to serve as a headquarters.

In response to the slaughter of 35 Union cowboys by Confederate guerrillas in Shelby County and to William Clarke Quantrill&#x27;s entrance into Kentucky, Gen. John Palmer placed 30 members of the Shelby County Home Guard and its captain Edwin Terrell on the federal payroll on April 1, 1865. The men roamed Shelby and its surrounding counties, persecuting Confederate guerrillas and Southern sympathizers. The Shelbyville trustees aimed to encourage them to stay close to the city, though, paying their hotel bills when they were in town. On May 10, Terrell and his men found Quantrill&#x27;s raiders at a barn outside Wakefield in Spencer Co. and fatally shot their leader. The city came out to cheer the men upon their return and the trustees continued paying their room and board for another month after the U.S. Army paid off and disbanded the troupe on May 26. The threat of raiding over, the blockhouse was demolished by September. By that time, Capt. Terrell and his lieutenant Harry Thompson had murdered and robbed an Illinois stock merchant named William R. Johnson. Over the next year, the local jury could not return a verdict. Terrell was transferred to Taylorsville to be tried for a separate shooting, but broke jail with two companions on May 26 and returned to Shelbyville to go drinking in its saloons. The town marshal George Caplinger organized a posse and took Terrell by surprise outside the Armstrong Hotel, shooting him in the spine, killing his relative John R. Baker, and fatally wounding bystander Merrett Redding. Taken to Louisville, Terrell avoided trial owing to the gravity of his wound and returned home to Harrisonville in October. On the 23rd of that month, Harry Thompson broke jail as well and, according to local lore, fled to Texas and lived out his days as the successful farmer &quot;Henry T. Grazian&quot;. The surgery in 1867 to remove the bullet from Terrell&#x27;s back was unsuccessful, though, and he died soon thereafter, aged 22.

===Recent history===

The agricultural community – principally producing corn, hemp, tobacco, wheat, pork, and beef – experienced a boom after the war. The Shelby Railroad Company connected the town to Anchorage in 1870, reaching the mainline of the Louisville, Cincinnati and Lexington Railroad. Downtown Shelbyville expanded and gained many large, ornate buildings, especially during the rebuilding following a large fire in 1909. The oldest remaining banks were also organized during this time. The late 19th Century also saw a public water system, electricity, and libraries brought to the town.

Following the Spanish–American War, 116 men from Shelbyville made up Company C of the 161st Regiment of Indiana Volunteer Infantry, which made up part of the occupation force in Cuba. They were stationed at Camp Columbia just outside Havana from December 17, 1898, until March 29, 1899.

In 1911, a mob of twenty men stormed the county jail and lynched three African Americans. One was convicted of murdering an African American woman and the other two accused of annoying white girls.

Interstate 64 was built south of the city in 1960 and helped the area become more industrialized; there are now three industrial parks on the west side of the city. The population increased from 4,525 in 1960 to over 10,000 by the year 2000.

<doc id="115427" wikidata="Q2294139" url="?curid=115427" title="Simpsonville, Kentucky">
<text>Simpsonville is a home rule-class city in Shelby County, Kentucky, in the United States. It is located 8 miles west of Shelbyville, Kentucky and 23 miles east of Louisville situated along U.S. 60. The population was 2,484 during the 2010 U.S. Census.

==Early history==

Simpsonville was first laid out in 1816 on the petition of Isaac Watkins. It received its first post office in 1821 and was incorporated in 1833. It was named in honor Captain John Simpson; a native Virginian who represented Shelby County in the Kentucky House of Representatives and died in the War of 1812. By 1825 it had become a stage coach town; one of the largest between Shelbyville and Louisville. The Midland trail stagecoach would either swap out or rest their horses and travelers could stay at the Old Stone Inn. The second oldest stone building in the county which is still standing today.

For most of its history Simpsonville was an agrarian community which dairy, tobacco, cattle, and hogs being the primary source of income for most residents. This was due to its remarkably fertile soil based on limestone and red clay. Later on it would be the genesis for the town&#x27;s moniker &#x27;American Saddlebred Horse Capital of the World&#x27;.

==Civil War==
In January 1865 at least 80 members of Company E of the 5th United States Colored Cavalry were transporting 900 head of Federal cattle from Camp Nelson to a stock market in Louisville. They set up camp in Simpsonville and on the morning of January 25 they were attacked by Confederate guerrillas led by Henry Magruder. The guerrillas attacked from the rear killing 22 Union soldiers and injuring over 20 more, at least some of whom were killed after trying to surrender. None of the guerrillas were documented to be injured. The Union army camped in Louisville was indifferent to the ambush, not responding for three days and leaving the citizens of Simpsonville to care for the wounded. Eventually, the wounded were transferred to an Army hospital in Jeffersonville, Indiana where a further four more died. The citizens of Simpsonville buried the dead in two mass graves that later became an African American cemetery, one of which is now marked with a memorial along U.S. 60. Some of the survivors later became Buffalo Soldiers.

No guerillas were ever prosecuted for the attack. However, Henry Magruder would be tried, convicted, and sentenced to death by a military tribunal for several other murders. He was executed at the Louisville Military Prison on October 20, 1865.

==Post Civil War and 20th Century==
In the years following the Civil War Simpsonville remained a small village of 200 to 300 residents and was a school and church center. It was connected west to Louisville and east to Shelbyville by the Louisville &amp; Eastern Railroad in 1910. An interurban railroad that would be purchased by the Louisville and Interurban Railroad in 1911 who would operate the line until 1934. In the years following the First World War Midland trail would be converted into U.S. 60 providing Simpsonville with a direct link to the U.S. Highway System. It was after the Second World War that Simpsonville&#x27;s population started to grow. The completion of Interstate 64 in 1965 created an easy connection to Louisville which allowed Simpsonville to add acres of new residences, factories, warehouses, and retail.

==Geography==

==Education==
Early in its history Simpsonville had several one-room schools including Professor John W. Adams&#x27; school in the 1850s and Jordans Fairview Academy from 1868 to 1880. By 1895 it had four private schools and its first public high school (Simpsonville High School) was built in 1912. In the following decades the high school was merged with Todd&#x27;s Point in 1940 and Finchville High School in 1950. The high school closed its doors in 1958 when Shelby County decided to consolidate its school system and it became Simpsonville Elementary school. Today Simpsonville is served by the Shelby County Public School system with its residents attending Martha Layne Collins High School in Shelbyville. There is also one private that serves all grades: Corpus Christi Academy.
Following the Civil War all Kentucky schools were segregated. Simpsonville&#x27;s African-American children attended Simpsonville School and Lincoln Model School. Simpsonville was also the site of the Lincoln Institute; a boarding school for African American founded in 1912. It was built by Berea College in response to the Day Law which forced segregation of all public and private educational facilities. It offered both high school and vocational training until 1966 when declining enrollment caused by Brown v. Board of Education forced it to close. Today the grounds serve as the Whitney M. Young, Jr. Job Corps Training Center.

<text>Allensville is a census-designated place and former city in Todd County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 189 at the 2000 census. Settled in the 19th century and formally incorporated in 1867, the city was named for a pioneer family in the area. The city government was officially dissolved in 2017 after years of inactivity.

==History==

Allensville was settled in the early 1800s, and was originally a crossroads community concentrated around the intersection of two early stagecoach coach roads (these roads roughly followed the paths of modern US 79 and KY 102). This crossroads was about a mile northwest of the community&#x27;s present location. By the late 1830s, Allensville included a post office, two general stores, and a blacksmith shop. The community is believed to have been named for a family of early settlers.

In 1860, the L&amp;N established a depot just south of the old Allensville community as part of its branch line from Bowling Green, Kentucky, to Memphis, Tennessee. Within a few years, most of the community&#x27;s merchants had relocated from the crossroads to the community&#x27;s current location, which was closer to the depot. After the Civil War, the city incorporated, and thrived for several decades as one of the primary agricultural shipping points between Bowling Green and Memphis. Kentucky&#x27;s first Rural Free Delivery service was established at the Allensville post office in 1897. In 1915, the L&amp;N built a newer, larger depot (this second depot was located where the Quonset hut now stands).

Allensville began to decline after World War II, as automobile traffic began to replace rail traffic, and the L&amp;N closed the depot in 1947. By the 1970s, most major businesses had moved away, and the city&#x27;s economy had again become primarily agrarian. The city government stopped functioning in the late 1970s, and the city was finally dissolved by the state court in 2017.

In 1988, several buildings and houses in Allensville were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Allensville Historic District.

==Geography==

<text>Cadiz ( ) is a home rule-class city and the county seat of Trigg County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 2,540 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Clarksville metropolitan area.

==Etymology==
William Henry Perrin&#x27;s 1884 &quot;History of Trigg County&quot; does not explain the origin of the Spanish name of the town.

From August to October, the commission platted the town in blocks and named it as Cadiz. Rennick&#x27;s &quot;Kentucky Place Names&quot; repeats the local tradition that a Spaniard in the surveying party successfully suggested his hometown. The book also states that &quot;It was definitely not named for the city in Ohio.&quot; The name, however, does not take the Spanish pronunciation.

<text>Sturgis is a home rule-class city in Union County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 1,898 at the 2010 census. Located in northwest Kentucky, the city was founded in 1890 and named for Samuel Sturgis, who owned the land now occupied by the city.

==History ==
The area surrounding what would become Sturgis was first settled by American Revolutionary War officers, mostly from Virginia, who had received bounty land for their service. &quot;The History of Union County&quot;, published in 1886 by The Courier Co., says, &quot;The county had its aristocrats but the [Civil] War had a decidedly leveling tendency yet, there is a tolerably well defined line still marking the society of the county into different sets.&quot;

Sturgis was founded the same year as a company town by the Cumberland Land and Iron Company within its coal-mining development. The name derives from either Samuel P. Sturgis, who originally owned the townsite, or for Alida Livingston Sturgis (Samuel&#x27;s sister), who was married to the president and general manager of the Ohio Valley Railroad Company. The community incorporated as a town on May 3, 1890, with population of 327. The town was reclassified as a city in the 1920s.

<doc id="115443" wikidata="Q694545" url="?curid=115443" title="Bowling Green, Kentucky">
<text>Bowling Green is a city and the county seat of Warren County, Kentucky, United States. Its population was 72,294 as of the 2020 census, making it the third-most populous city in the state, after Louisville and Lexington. The Bowling Green metropolitan area is the fourth-largest in the state and had a population of 179,639 in 2020.

Founded by pioneers in 1798, Bowling Green was the provisional capital of Confederate Kentucky during the American Civil War. In the 21st century, it is the location of numerous manufacturers, including General Motors, Spalding, and Fruit of the Loom. The Bowling Green Assembly Plant has been the source of all Chevrolet Corvettes built since 1981. Bowling Green is also home to Western Kentucky University (or WKU for short), and the National Corvette Museum.

==History==
===Settlement and incorporation===
The first Europeans known to have reached the area carved their names on beech trees near the river . By 1778, settlers established McFadden&#x27;s Station on the north bank of the Barren River.

Present-day Bowling Green developed from homesteads erected by Robert and George Moore and General Elijah Covington, not the namesake of the town near Cincinnati.

Some controversy exists over the source of the town&#x27;s name. The city refers to the first county commissioners&#x27; meeting (1798), which named the town &quot;Bolin Green&quot; after the Bowling Green in New York City, where patriots had pulled down a statue of King George III and used the lead to make bullets during the American Revolution. According to the &quot;Encyclopedia of Kentucky&quot;, the name was derived from Bowling Green, Virginia, whence early migrants had come, or the personal &quot;ball alley game&quot; of founder Robert Moore.

===19th century===
By 1810, Bowling Green had 154 residents. Growth in steamboat commerce and the proximity of the Barren River increased Bowling Green&#x27;s prominence. In 1821, the Kentucky Legislature built a toll road between the town and Cloverport on the Ohio River. Canal locks and dams on the Barren River made it much more navigable. In 1832, the first portage railway connected the river to the location of the current county courthouse. Mules pulled freight and passengers to and from the city on the tracks.

Despite rapid urbanization of the Bowling Green area in the 1830s, agriculture remained an important part of local life. A visitor to Bowling Green noted the boasting of a tavern proprietor named Benjamin Vance:
In 1859, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (currently CSX Transportation) laid railroad through Bowling Green that connected the city with northern and southern markets.

Bowling Green declared itself neutral in an attempt to escape the Civil War. Because of its prime location and resources, however, both the Union and Confederacy sought control of the city. The majority of its residents rejected both the Confederacy and the Lincoln administration. On September 18, 1861, around 1,300 Confederate soldiers arrived from Tennessee to occupy the city, placed under command of Kentucky native General Simon Bolivar Buckner. The city&#x27;s pro-Union feelings surprised the Confederate occupiers. The Confederates fortified surrounding hills to secure possible military approaches to the valuable river and railroad assets. In November 1861, the provisional Confederate government of Kentucky chose Bowling Green as its capital.

On February 14, 1862, after receiving reports that Fort Henry on the Tennessee River and Fort Donelson on the Cumberland River had both been captured by Union forces under Ulysses S. Grant, the Confederates began to withdraw from Bowling Green. They destroyed bridges across the Barren River, the railroad depot, and other important buildings that could be used by the enemy. The city was subject to disruptions and raids throughout the remainder of the war. During the summer of 1864, Union General Stephen G. Burbridge arrested 22 civilians in and around Bowling Green on a charge of treason. This incident and other harsh treatment by federal authorities led to bitterness toward the Union among Bowling Green residents and increased sympathies with the Confederacy.

After the Civil War, Bowling Green&#x27;s business district grew considerably. Previously, agriculture had dominated the city&#x27;s economy. During the 1870s, many of the historic business structures seen today were erected. One of the most important businesses in Bowling Green of this era was Carie Burnam Taylor&#x27;s dress-making company. By 1906, Taylor employed more than 200 women.

In 1868, the city constructed its first waterworks system. The fourth county courthouse was completed in 1868. The first three were completed in 1798, 1805, and 1813. In 1889, the first mule-drawn streetcars appeared in the city. The first electric streetcars began to replace them by 1895.

The Sisters of Charity of Nazareth founded St. Columbia&#x27;s Academy in 1862, succeeded by St. Joseph&#x27;s School in 1911. In 1884, the Southern Normal School, which had been founded in 1875, moved to Bowling Green from the town of Glasgow, Kentucky. Pleasant J. Potter founded a women&#x27;s college in Bowling Green in 1889. It closed in 1909 and its property was sold to the Western Kentucky State Normal School (see below, now known as Western Kentucky University). Other important schools in this era were Methodist Warren College, Ogden College (which also became a part of Western Kentucky University), and Green River Female College, a boarding school.

===20th century===
In 1906, Henry Hardin Cherry, the president and owner of Southern Normal School, donated the school to the state as the basis of the Western State Normal School. The school trained teachers for the expanding educational needs of the state. This institution is now known as Western Kentucky University and is the second-largest public university in the state, having recently surpassed the University of Louisville.

In 1906, Doctors Lillian H. South, J. N. McCormack, and A.T. McCormack opened St. Joseph Hospital to provide medical and nursing care to the residents and students in the area.

In 1925, the third and last Louisville and Nashville Railroad Station was opened. About 27 trains arrived daily at the depot. Intercity bus lines were also a popular form of travel. By the 1960s, railroad travel had dramatically declined in the face of competition from airlines and automobiles. The station has been adapted for use as a museum.

In 1940, a Union Underwear factory built in Bowling Green bolstered the city&#x27;s economy significantly. During the 1960s, the city&#x27;s population began to surpass that of Ashland, Paducah, and Newport.

Downtown streets became a bottleneck for traffic. In 1949, the U.S. Route 31W Bypass was opened to alleviate traffic problems, but it also drew off business from downtown. The bypass grew to become a business hotspot in Bowling Green. A 1954 advertisement exclaimed, &quot;Your business can grow in the direction Bowling Green is growing – to the 31-W By-Pass&quot;.

By the 1960s, the face of shopping was changing completely from the downtown retail square to suburban shopping centers. Between May and November 1967, stores in Bowling Green Mall opened for business. Another advertisement said, &quot;One-stop shopping. Just park [free], step out and shop. You&#x27;ll find everything close at hand.&quot; Between September 1979 and September 1980, stores in the larger Greenwood Mall came online. The city&#x27;s limits began to stretch toward Interstate 65.

By the late 1960s, Interstate 65, which runs just to the east of Bowling Green, was completed. The Green River Parkway (now called the William H. Natcher Parkway and renamed I-165 in April 2019), was completed in the 1970s to connect Bowling Green and Owensboro. These vital transportation arteries attracted many industries to Bowling Green.

In 1981, General Motors moved its Chevrolet Corvette assembly plant from St. Louis, Missouri, to Bowling Green. In the same year, the National Corvette Homecoming event was created: it is a large, annual gathering of Corvette owners, car parades, and related activities in Bowling Green. In 1994, the National Corvette Museum was constructed near the assembly plant.

In 1997, Bowling Green was designated a Tree City USA by the National Arbor Day Foundation.

===21st century===
In 2012, the city undertook a feasibility study on ways to revitalize the downtown Bowling Green area. The Downtown Redevelopment Authority was formed to plan redevelopment. Plans for the project incorporated Bowling Green&#x27;s waterfront assets, as well as its historic center and streetscape around Fountain Square. It also proposed a new building for the Bowling Green Area Chamber of Commerce, construction of a Riverwalk Park where downtown borders the Barren River, creation of a new public park called Circus Square, and installation of a new retail area, the Fountain Square Market.

As of spring 2009, the new Chamber of Commerce, Riverwalk Park, and Circus Square have been completed. The Southern Kentucky Performing Arts Center, a facility for arts and education, broke ground in October 2009 and celebrated its opening night on March 10, 2012, with a concert by Vince Gill. Ground was broken for the Fountain Square Market in 2012.

In 2005, an effort was made to incorporate a Whitewater Park into the downtown Bowling Green riverfront at Weldon Peete Park. Due to the recession, the project was not funded.

In 2011, the Bowling Green Riverfront Foundation expanded its efforts to develop land on the opposite side of Barren River from Mitch McConnell Park (which is located alongside the U.S. 31-W Bypass and the riverbank, between Louisville Road and Old Louisville Road), upriver to Peete Park. The new plans include use of the adjacent river for white-water sports—the stretch of river includes rapids rated on the International Scale of River Difficulty between Class II and Class IV—as well as a mountain biking trail, a bicycle pump track, and a rock climbing area. Some of this facility will be located on a reclaimed landfill, which had served as Bowling Green&#x27;s garbage dump for many years.

===2021 tornadoes===
During the early-morning hours of December 11, 2021, two destructive tornadoes struck Bowling Green. The first was an EF3 tornado that heavily damaged or destroyed several buildings and homes and killed seventeen people. The second tornado formed alongside the Main EF3 and caused additional damage on the southern and eastern parts of the city and was rated EF2.

<text>Monticello is a city in Wayne County, Kentucky, United States. It is the seat of its county. Its population was 5,753 at the time of the 2020 United States census.

Monticello claims to be &quot;the Houseboat Capital of the World&quot;, as numerous houseboat manufacturers operate in the city. The city is located along Lake Cumberland. Its economy is built on serving the recreational and tourist traffic to the lake.

Monticello is located near the center of Wayne County, along Elk Creek, a tributary of Beaver Creek, which flows westward into Lake Cumberland. State highways 92, 90, and 167 were constructed to intersect at the county seat.

== History ==

Monticello was designated as the county seat when the Wayne County was formed in 1800. The first Wayne county clerk, Micah Taul, named the town after Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s plantation and home; Jefferson was elected President of the United States that year. Joshua Jones, a surveyor and Revolutionary War veteran, laid out the town on 13 acres owned by William Beard. By 1810, the population numbered 27.

The first recorded school in Wayne County was opened around 1800 by Robert Ferrill, a well-educated wheelwright who had a few good books. Monticello&#x27;s first school was opened in 1807 by Rodes Garth, who taught &quot;Roman history, the Scriptures, orthography, and pronunciation.&quot; In 1819, Yale graduate John S. Frisbie began a school with Michael Huffaker as the first teacher of record. The Monticello Academy was established in 1830 with John Lankford as the headmaster, followed by Professor Mullins, and later William Burton.

In 1843, under the guidance of Commissioners Micajah Phillips, John Rousseau, Martin Beaty, and Francis Goddard, the county voted and ratified to organize into common school districts. The first examiners for receiving a teaching certificate were physician Jonathan S. Frisbie, lawyer John Lankford, and teacher Littleton Beard. By 1842, 16 schoolhouses had been built in Wayne County, three listed within several miles of Monticello. Teachers at these schools before the Civil War include Amanda McGee, William and Thomas Simpson, Joseph Ballou, and Marcellus Baugh. In these early schools, textbooks were scarce, but included &quot;Dilworth&#x27;s Spelling Book&quot;, &quot;Murray&#x27;s English Reader and English Grammar&quot;, &quot;Noble Butler&#x27;s Goodrich Readers and Grammar&quot;, and the &quot;McGuffey&#x27;s Readers&quot;. The first school superintendent of Wayne County was Robert McBeath, a &quot;member of a family noted for their intellectual qualities.&quot; His son, Tom McBeath, moved on to be president of Florida State University.

In 1866, following the Civil War, the Kendrick Academy opened in Monticello with Milton Elliott as principal. Teachers in Monticello in the 1860s and &#x27;70s include Marion Huffaker, Marshall Stone, and Ala Shearer. Ones in the 1880s and &#x27;90s include Lucy and Amanda Taylor, Sallie and Eula Kendrick, Emma Kelley, Fount Cooper, William Sandusky, Tobias Huffaker, and Mollie Denny, who became the Wayne County superintendent. In 1872, the Kendrick Academy closed due to a fire.

Job, and Georgia Brock; and around 1890 added kindergarten and primary schools with teachers Ms. Oakley and Graves. Successive principals at the school until the close of the 19th century were W. T. Chafin, T. Leigh Thompson, Professor H. C. Jones, Hayden Grubbs, Professor Chafin again, and finally Mr. Ballard.

From 1905 until 2013, Monticello had Monticello Independent Schools, its own school district independent of the surrounding Wayne County Schools.

<text>Providence is a home rule-class city in Webster County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 3,193 at the time of the 2010 United States Census, making the most populous community in the county.

==History==
In 1820, Richard B. Savage arrived from Virginia with his wife and his elder sister Mary (Savage) Settler, and opened a general store on the site of the present city. The community that grew up was known as Savageville, until the post office was established in 1828, when it was renamed &quot;Providence&quot;. Though sometimes said to honor the Rhode Island city of that name, local history records that an old trader who had been helped by nearby farmers suggested the name to honor divine Providence. On February 18, 1840, the town had a population of 150; there were three physicians, five stores, two hotels, a school, a Baptist church, a Masonic lodge, and three tobacco stemmeries. Located in the heart of the state&#x27;s Black Patch tobacco-growing region, Providence eventually became the 3rd-largest stemming market in all of America.

Providence was incorporated in 1860, when Webster County was formed. The onset of the Civil War slowed the economic growth, though no major battles took place. The State of Kentucky never left the Union, but inhabitants in Western Kentucky were still largely sympathetic to pro-Confederate troops. A Confederate reconnaissance and foraging party led by then Lieutenant Colonel Nathan Bedford Forrest passed through Webster County between November and December 1861, and Forrest reported that he had been welcomed by the inhabitants. Limited guerrilla warfare also took place near the city in 1862.

Commercial coal mining began in 1888, and by 1930 Providence residents numbered 4,742. In the 1930s, depressed conditions in the coal fields resulted in a loss of population that continued through the 1960s. Providence&#x27;s economy remains tied to coal and agriculture.

In 1993, the Providence Commercial Historic District was created to recognize the historic buildings in the downtown area.

Sebree, intended to name it Springdale after nearby natural springs, but the name was preëmpted by another community in Mason County. The post office was initially named McBride, but renamed for Col. Sebree (the first president of the St. Bernard Mining Company) in 1870 for his assistance in bringing the railroad to this part of the state.

The L&amp;N depot was on the eastern side of the track and furnished with day and night operators. At one time, Sebree was home to some 40 businesses, hotels, shops and stores.

<text>Williamsburg is a home rule-class city in and the county seat of Whitley County, on the southeastern border of Kentucky, United States. The population was 5,326 at the 2020 census. Developed along the Cumberland River, the city was founded in 1818 and named after William Whitley.

==History==

Williamsburg was first known by early European-American settlers as the Spring Ford, after a nearby ford crossing the Cumberland River. On April 19, 1818, the first meeting of the Whitley County Court was held at Samuel Cox&#x27;s dwelling. This first court appointed local officials as well as constables to work with the county militia. The town was known simply as Whitley Courthouse. In 1882, the city was renamed as Williamsburgh, and the spelling was changed in 1890 to the current Williamsburg.

The town&#x27;s initial growth was fueled by three freshwater springs in the area. Settlers were attracted to this water source. They later developed coal mining and lumber industries, based on natural resources of the area.

Construction of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (L&amp;N) to the town in 1883 stimulated new growth. It connected the town to far-flung markets and attracted new residents and trade. Shortly thereafter in 1886, the town elected W. H. Parker as its first mayor.

This first city government enacted a number of new ordinances including:

* Prohibiting &quot;Bawdy Houses&quot; (brothels)
* Prohibiting Gambling
* Prohibiting Fornication
* Prohibiting Rolling Hoops on Sidewalks
* Prohibiting Barbering on Sundays 
* Prohibiting Unattended Cattle on Main Street

The Williamsburg school system was established in 1909; the town residents voted to consolidate the multiple single-room schools in the area into a unified school district. The first consolidated school building was destroyed by fire in 1926. It was rebuilt for the school administration. Later the structure was adapted as the Anderson Building, which is used in the early 21st century by the University of the Cumberlands. The school district moved to its current location in 1983.

The county courthouse was destroyed by fire in 1931. It was rebuilt at the time. Forty years later, it underwent a major renovation to bring it up to standards of 1971. In 2011, the newly constructed Whitley County Judicial Center was completed adjacent to the old courthouse, and the courts moved to the new building.

==Geography==
Williamsburg is located within the Eastern Mountain Coal Fields and the Appalachian Plateau regions. The oldest parts of the city lie in a bend of the Cumberland River just downstream of where the Clear Fork flows into it east of the city. The University of the Cumberlands occupies the heights within the river bend. The I-75 corridor runs past the west side of the city with exits 11 and 15 providing access. I-75 leads north 103 mi (166 km) to Lexington and south 70 mi (113 km) to Knoxville, Tennessee.

<text>Midway is a home rule-class city in Woodford County, Kentucky, in the United States. Its population was 1,741 at the time of the year 2020 U.S. census. It is part of the Lexington-Fayette Metropolitan Statistical Area.

An active business association holds events every month of the year, and the city is a starting point or waypoint for several road races that wind through the surrounding countryside.

==History==
Before its European exploration, the area around Midway was inhabited by the Mound Builders. Two large and several smaller American Indian mounds have been identified on nearby farms.

The present city began as a small settlement known as Stevenson&#x27;s at the time of its first post office in 1832. On January 31, 1835, the local farmer John Francisco sold his farm to the Lexington and Ohio Railroad for $6,491.25. The railroad then used the land to establish Kentucky&#x27;s first railroad town, naming it Middleway for its location relative to Lexington and Frankfort, Kentucky. (The town is also equidistant between Versailles and Georgetown.) The major streets of Midway were named in honor of the railroad&#x27;s original officials. It was renamed Midway in 1837.

Midway Historic District comprises much of downtown Midway, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Distilling Bourbon in Midway===
Midway has a very rich history of distilling Bourbon for nearly a 100-year period from 1865 to 1959. The Distillery was located at the corner of Gratz Street and Dudley Street, nestled in the bend of the Lee&#x27;s Branch of the North Elkhorn Creek. There were several owners over the years, with the Distillery operating under various business names. Buford, Guthrie &amp; Co. 1865–67, A. Buford Distillery 1867–68, Keller Distillery 1868–77, 1878–89, S.J. Greenbaum Distillery 1890–1911, Belle of Anderson Distillery 1912–14, Midway Distilling Co. 1915–24, Destroyed by fire in 1924 and closed from then till 1933, rebuilt and operated as the Woodford County Distilling Company 1933–40, Park &amp; Tilford Distillery 1941–53, Schenley Products Distillery 1954–59. Early in the 1960s, Schenley Products donated the property, building and equipment to the Midway Woman&#x27;s College. Notable national brand names produced include, Belle of Bourbon, Belle of Lexington, Belle of Anderson, Glenarme, Arlington, Jessamine, and Woodford. Two buildings still remain, currently known as Kentucky Cannabis Company, previously a distilling building and The Midway Loft Apartments, previously an aging warehouse. A large Distillery warehouse fire occurred on August 4, 1908, where over 47,000 barrels of bourbon where destroyed. The Lee&#x27;s Branch was on fire for over one mile, and several Midway residents were scorched dipping tin cups into the Lee&#x27;s Branch for Bourbon and Water. Martin Street next to the Lee&#x27;s Branch was nicknamed “Tin Cup Alley”. The Midway Fire Department was recognized for saving the City and the Female Orphan&#x27;s School.

In 1920, during a robbery of the distillery, Benjamin Rodgers and Homer Nave were killed. Richard W. James, was arrested for the killings. He admitted to the robbery but denied shooting the men, and claimed that the facility&#x27;s superintendent of bottling, Samuel Seay, had a deal with James and others to share the proceeds of the stolen liquor. James was convicted of murder, but one member of the jury refused to vote for his execution on religious grounds. On March 13, 1921, a mob took James from the county jail in Versailles, Kentucky and lynched him from a tree near Margaret College, about a half-mile from Versailles. No one from the mob was indicted and, when Gov. Edwin P. Morrow removed the sheriff from his post, local voters elected his wife to replace him.

<text>Church Point () is a town in Acadia Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 4,560 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Crowley Micropolitan Statistical Area. Church Point is known as the Buggy Capital of the World as it used to be host to the annual Buggy Festival which has since gone defunct.

==History==
In the late 18th century, French settlers from Nova Scotia (Acadie) Canada, created clearings by burning the underbrush, leaving what they called a &quot;brûlé&quot;, or &quot;burn&quot;, much as the Native Americans in the area had created a &quot;burn&quot; to promote new grass to attract bison and other grazing and browsing animals.

One of these clearings was created on a slough off Bayou Mermentau, near where the slough came to a point. This new clearing became known as Plaquemine Brûlé in 1843 when Etienne d&#x27;Aigle III, a descendant of immigrants from Quebec, became the first settler in the area, which at that time was in the middle of Opelousas Parish (later St. Landry Parish), which stretched from the Atchafalaya River to the Sabine River.

&quot;Plaquemine&quot; is an Atakapa word for the native Louisiana persimmon. The French term &quot;Plaquemine Brûlé&quot; is translated into English as &quot;Burnt Persimmon&quot; - a result of the burning of the brush and other woody growth, which apparently contained persimmon trees, during the widening of a slough off Bayou Mermentau to accommodate barge travel for local farmers.

As more families were attracted to the area, Jesuit missionaries fulfilled their spiritual needs by establishing a chapel in 1848 on land donated by the d&#x27;Aigle brothers Etienne (III) and Joseph (&quot;José&quot;). The church was known as &quot;La Chapelle de la pointe de Plaquemine Brûlé&quot; (in English, &quot;The Church at the point of Burnt Persimmon&quot;). The English term was later shortened to &quot;Church Point&quot; to refer to the spire on top of the church which could be seen, and traversed to, for miles in this frontier area, and translated back into French as &quot;La Pointe de l&#x27;Eglise&quot;.

&quot;Plaquemine Brûlé was considered part of the frontier for the next several decades, as there were no railroads and the swampy terrain made overland travel difficult. Early pioneers to the area requested land grants along the bayou only large enough to satisfy their families&#x27; immediate needs. Many families raised cattle, which roamed freely on the open range of the prairie.&quot; [2]

The town&#x27;s first school was established in 1856, providing encouragement for the community to grow further. The first post office for the town of &quot;Church Point&quot; was established in the area on September 29, 1873, marking the settlement&#x27;s first official recognition as a community. Thirteen years later, residents of the town voted with those of surrounding communities to form a new parish known as Acadia.

Since 1981, the Acadia St. Landry Medical Foundation, which supports the Acadia St. Landry Hospital, has organized an annual Buggy Festival held in Church Point on the first weekend in June. The town was chosen because residents had used buggies as their main means of transportation until the early 1950s, earning Church Point the nickname &quot;Buggy Capital of the world&quot; in 1927. In its first 25 years, the festival earned over $440,000 in profits, which were distributed among the hospital, the parks department of the city of Church Point, and various civic organizations. Two scholarships are also awarded annually. The festival, which includes a Sunday parade, gives visitors the opportunity to explore various horse-drawn vehicles. Cajun musicians perform throughout the weekend, while Cajun cuisine is featured. The festival also often includes a French speaking contest and a Cajun French accordion contest. Each year the town holds a &quot;Courir de Mardi Gras&quot;.

In 1987 Church Point established a relationship with Church Point, Nova Scotia, bringing about a revival of interest in its French culture. The town now proudly calls itself the &quot;Cajun Music Capital of the World&quot;, based on &quot;having the greatest number of professional Cajun musicians of any place on earth&quot;. A different Cajun musician is honored each year on Cajun Day, the second Sunday in November.

Among the many professional musicians, Church Point is also the origin of the multi-media recording artist, musician, and composer Fabian Thibodeaux (professionally known as &quot;Isadar&quot;) and his oldest brother, organist Dexter Thibodeaux.

<text>Estherwood is a village in Acadia Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 889 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Crowley Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The Estherwood area had two earlier names, &quot;Tortue&quot;, after the Indian chief, and &quot;Coulée Trief&quot; or &quot;Trive&quot;. The Coulée Trief name involves Jean-Baptiste Trief, a mysterious person believed to have been one of Jean Lafitte&#x27;s pirates, who built a cabin on the coulee, about west of Crowley, Louisiana, about 1816. He was described as a &quot;tall, dark, sinister-looking&quot; man who wore large earrings like pirates once did.

There are several stories about how Estherwood got its name. A likely one is that it is the combination of two names: Wood, for a Dr. Wood who was once prominent in the area, and Esther, for the wife of a railroad executive. Another is the &quot;wood&quot; part may come from the fact that the trains stopped for fuel wood here.

Jacob Kollitz and A. D. LeBlanc established stores near the Trief cabin in the early 1890s, and a little settlement began to grow around them. Kollitz also operated the 15-room Estherwood Hotel for a time, but it was closed in 1907.

The settlement began to grow just after the turn of the century with the Miller-Morris Canal, one of the first large rice irrigation systems, which helped establish the rice industry in the area, followed in 1900 by the opening of the Eureka rice mill at Estherwood.

By the spring of 1900, there were more than 30 residences in the town, new streets were being graded, and sidewalks were being put down. A chapel was finished there in 1910 and ministered as a mission of St. John the Evangelist Church in Mermentau. Estherwood was incorporated as a village on March 12, 1901, and Henry Feitel was elected its first mayor.

==Geography==
Estherwood is located at (30.184177, -92.463376).

<text>Iota is a town in Acadia Parish, Louisiana. The population was 1,304 in 2020. Iota is part of the Crowley Micropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==
The history of Iota is identified with Pointe-aux-Loups (French for Wolf Point), one of the oldest place names in southwest Louisiana, and the location of mineral springs that attracted many visitors beginning about 1858. The older settlement was located on Bayou des Cannes about two miles west of the present Town of Iota. A post office named Cartville, for the first postmaster Samuel Cart, was established in the vicinity of Pointe-aux-Loups in 1884. Ten years later, a railroad branch line from Midland to Eunice bypassed Cartville by a mile or so to the east. The railroad company built a depot at a point on the line nearest to the Cartville and Pointe-aux-Loups settlements, naming it Iota. The Cartville post office was changed to Iota in 1900.

C.C. Duson is credited with being the founder of Iota. It was he who promoted the construction of the Southern Pacific rail line to Eunice, the new town that he founded in St. Landry Parish. At the same time, 1894, Duson acquired the land on which Iota now stands, a 160-acre tract which had been homesteaded by Archille Doucet in 1835. Duson divided the land into town lots and sold them. Duson was the prime mover in the establishment of the Acadia Canal Company in the vicinity of Iota, and president of the town&#x27;s first rice mill in 1901—two businesses said to have been responsible for Iota&#x27;s early economic development.

Iota and its people continued to prosper throughout the 20th century, with agriculture and petroleum as the primary sectors of the local economy. During this time, rice and later crawfish developed as the main cash crops of the area.

In the 1990s, it was discovered that Iota has an unusually high number of people carrying Tay-Sachs, a rare genetic disorder.

Iota was represented in the novel &quot;No Place Louisiana&quot; by Martin Pousson, published in 2002.

Iota is the home of American Legion Post No. 371 and many veterans of foreign wars.

==Geography==
Iota is located at (30.328500, −92.493123).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 1,304 people, 648 households, and 409 families residing in the town.

==Arts and culture==

The annual Iota Mardi Gras Folklife Festival attracts thousands of tourists and visitors, offering authentic Cajun food, music and crafts. In contrast to the elaborate costumes and parades of urban Carnival krewes, in Iota and nearby rural communities like Tee Mamou and LeJeune Cove, Cajuns celebrate &quot;Courir de Mardi Gras&quot;. Disguised with masks, costumes, and conical hats called capuchons, the townspeople travel through the surrounding countryside, making merry while begging for money and gumbo ingredients. The gumbo is the centerpiece of a communal supper and dance, where the Mardi Gras riders sing the &quot;Chanson de Mardi Gras&quot;, an old Cajun French drinking and begging song, and then take off their masks to reveal, ostensibly for the first time that day, the identity of each rider.

==Education==
Acadia Parish School Board serves Iota, operating Iota High School. St. Francis Catholic School is also located in the district.

<text>Mermentau is a village in Acadia Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 661 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Crowley Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
In the last quarter of the 18th century, there was an Atakapa chief named Nementou. On April 16, 1784, he sold land on Bayou Plaquemine Brule to Antoin Blanc for $100. Nementou is later mentioned as chief of a village on a river with the same name. Eventually, through a clerical error, Nementou became Mementou and this was then corrupted into Mermentau through confusion with the French word &quot;mer&quot;, which means &quot;sea&quot;.

The Mermentau area was once reputedly a refuge for smugglers. It was a crossing point for brave travelers on the Old Spanish Trail, but had such a bad reputation that until the Louisiana Purchase no one would go there to see how many people there were.

John Landreth was a surveyor who was sent from Washington, D.C., in 1818 to look for timber in Acadiana that could be harvested for the use of building Navy ships. He kept a journal and had this to say: &quot;&quot;...these places, particularly the Mermentau and Calcasieu are the harbours and Dens of the most abandoned wretches of the human race... smugglers and Pirates who go about the coast of the Gulph (sic) of vessels of a small draught of water and rob and plunder without distinction every vessel of every nation they meet and are able to conquer and put to death every soul they find on board without respect of persons age or sex and then their unlawful plunder they carry all through the country and sell at a very low rate and find plenty of purchasers.&quot; &quot;

===Early settlement===
During the Civil War and the years immediately after it there were widespread reports of bushwhackers, robbers, and other fugitives hiding in the Mermentau woods and tales of hidden treasures in the area. According to one of the stories, a man named Frank Quebedeaux once found an iron pot filled with coins. The cache had been hidden between four copal trees that had grown close together.

One of the earliest known settlers was John Webb, an English seaman who came in 1827. It is said that Webb was a member of the crew of Admiral Horatio Nelson&#x27;s flagship at the famous Battle of Trafalgar (Oct. l, 1805) in which the British defeated French and Spanish fleets but during which Nelson was killed. Webb lived in an area that came to be known as Webb&#x27;s Cove, near the junction of the Mermentau River and Bayou Queue de Tortue. Cornelius Duson McNaughton, who was running from the law in Quebec, joined Webb there about 1837.

Jean Castex, a native of France, came to Mermentau around 1856. He opened a mercantile business in 1859 and later became one of Acadia Parish&#x27;s leading merchants. He was also a cotton and rice farmer and built what may have been the first cotton gin in the parish in 1860. A sawmill was also built at the town about that time. The Mermentau post office was established on September 2, 1859.

Victorin Maignaud, another native of France, came to Mermentau in 1866 and opened a dry goods store. Maignaud operated the river ferry for some 40 years, was postmaster for 17 years, and eventually owned a store, hotel, sawmill, and rice mill.

Timber from the Mermentau area provided much of the building material and fencing used by the prairie settlers. The lumber was hauled by oxcart to places as far away as Opelousas.

On May 18, 1872, the &quot;Opelousas Courier&quot; reported: &quot;&quot;For the last two weeks the streets of our town have been almost daily crowded with carts and wagons loaded with pieux, boards, and shingles coming from Pointe-aux-Loups and Mermento (sic). Never has there been such a crowd at one time, and so successively we counted eleven ox-wagons in one expedition in one day this week. Eight feet pieux are worth $12 per 100; six feet pieux, $6, and shingles, $6 per 1,000.&quot; &quot;

Jesuit priests from Grand Coteau began to visit Mermentau in the 1860s. In 1871, Father Joseph Anthonioz had begun to gather lumber to build a chapel there, but it was never finished. The first church was built in 1882, next to the Maignaud Cemetery on what is now Hwy. 90. It burned down in 1886.

In 1891, a temporary chapel was built at another location. Property for the church in its present location was donated in 1889 by Jean Castex and Mrs. Marie U. Duhon, widow of Aurelien Duhon. A larger church was built there, but in August 1900 it was blown off its foundation by a storm and damaged beyond use. It was finally rebuilt in 1908.

===Later years===
The Louisiana Western Railroad reached Mermentau in 1880. In February of that year only of roadbed remained to be graded between Lafayette and Mermentau. Some 150 convicts were at work on the stretch near Bayou Blanc. By the end of July the road was completed from Mermentau westward to the Texas line.

By the end of August 1880, the railroad line from New Orleans to Houston was open for freight business. Passenger trains with sleepers attached were running a regular schedule from New Orleans to Houston by the end of September.

The trains, however, did not solve all transportation problems for the area. Produce, lumber, and cattle had to be transported to the rail line. Capt. George W. Caldwell began carrying freight on the Mermentau about 1890, eventually owning a fleet of small boats and 24 barges. The barges hauled rice, oil, cattle, cotton, wood, and general freight. Capt Caldwell also operated a commissary on the river front and issued metal tokens in denominations of 5,10, 25 and 50 cents and $1. These became known as &quot;Mermentau Money&quot;.

During the 1890s, the 96-ton &quot;Olive&quot; operated as a popular passenger and freight hauler on the Mermentau River, making round trips every other day from Mermentau to Lake Arthur. People from Crowley and elsewhere would take the train to Mermentau, then board the &quot;Olive&quot; for a weekend trip to Lake Arthur. The boat was described as &quot;a splendid sternwheel packet&quot;. The Louisiana Press Association members and their wives, meeting in Crowley in 1894, were entertained on one such excursion. Fares were 50 cents one-way or 75 cents for a round-trip ticket.

Mermentau achieved legal village status on November 11, 1899.

===Today===
Today, arrow points can be found here and there at the places where the Atakapa Indians once lived. Mermentau is especially known for where Captain James Campbell, pirate Jean Laffite&#x27;s most trusted lieutenant, stashed $9,000 in gold coins.

==Geography==
Mermentau is located at (30.187845, -92.582786).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and (7.39%) is water.

Situated along the Mermentau River, Mermentau supplies freshwater for the Mermentau Basin. The basin contains about of wetlands, consisting of of fresh marsh, of intermediate marsh, and of brackish marsh. A total of of marsh has converted to open water since 1932, a loss of 19 percent of the historical wetlands in the basin.

<text>Rayne is a city in the U.S. state of Louisiana, in Acadia Parish. With a population of 7,326 at the 2020 United States census, it is nicknamed the &quot;Frog Capital of the World&quot;, as well as the &quot;Louisiana City of Murals&quot;. Rayne is part of the Crowley micropolitan statistical area, and within the Lafayette metropolitan statistical area in Acadiana.

==History==

Rayne is located in Acadia Parish and has a rich history dating back to the late 19th century. The area that would become Rayne was originally part of a large land grant awarded to French settlers in the 18th century. These settlers were primarily involved in agriculture, cultivating crops such as rice and sugarcane. 

The establishment of Rayne began in earnest in the 1880s with the arrival of the railroad. The city was initially named Pouppeville, after a prominent local figure, but was soon renamed Rayne in honor of Rayne Grey, an engineer for the Southern Pacific Railroad, whose efforts were instrumental in bringing the railroad to the area. The railroad not only facilitated transportation and commerce but also attracted a diverse population, contributing to the town&#x27;s growth and development.

Rayne&#x27;s association with frogs began in the early 20th century. Local entrepreneur Jacques Weil noticed the abundance of frogs in the region and started exporting frog legs to New Orleans. This venture proved successful, and soon Rayne became known for its frog exports, earning its unique moniker. Over time, frogs became an integral part of the city&#x27;s identity and culture.

Throughout its history, Rayne has experienced growth and modernization while retaining its small-town charm and distinctive character. The community values its historical roots and continues to celebrate its unique cultural heritage, making Rayne a noteworthy example of Louisiana&#x27;s rich and diverse history.

==History==
James A. Kinder, a Union soldier, went south during the Civil War and after the war, he returned to the state, settling first in Rapides Parish in 1870, then moving south to Kinder. He homesteaded a Soldier&#x27;s Land Grant of and built a home and store where Highway 165 and Highway 190 now intersect. His customers called the store &quot;Kinder&#x27;s Store&quot;.

Jabez Bunting Watkins brought the Watkins, Kansas City and Gulf Railroad through Kinder, and purchased Kinder&#x27;s land in 1892. Kinder moved to Lake Charles.

After buying Kinder&#x27;s property, JB Watkins brought in a surveyor, John W. Rhorer, to make a plat and lay out town streets for a company town. In 1903, Louisiana Gov. William Heard issued a proclamation declaring the site the Village of Kinder.

Among the first families who came to Kinder, all employees of Watkins Enterprises, were Milton B. McRill, John M. Houston and Philetus Philbrick. McRill joined JB Watkins&#x27; venture as a railroad contractor. His job was to build of railway from Alexandria to Lake Charles. McRill bought lots at the corner of Ninth Street and Fourth Avenue and built the first home in Kinder. McRill, who became one of the early mayors of Kinder, often provided lodging and meals for teachers because he believed strongly in education.

John M. Houston came south to serve as office manager and surveyor for the railroad Watkins was building. About before the railroad reached Lake Charles, Houston selected and purchased a tract of timber land. He built a sawmill and commissary on the tract north of Kinder, alongside the railroad, to enable him to ship logs to other states. Houston&#x27;s commissary became known as the &quot;Houston spur&quot;.

Philetus Philbrick came south from the University of Iowa, where he had helped set up the Department of Engineering and taught there for 14 years. It was Philbrick&#x27;s knowledge of railroading that brought him in contact with Watkins, then south to Kinder as a railroad surveyor. Philetus wrote to his brother Franklin, telling him of the available and fertile farmland. Franklin brought his family south and bought a farm north of Kinder. There was no school then, and the state would not furnish a teacher until the school had operated for three months. Franklin Philbrick opened the school and taught without pay in the small, rough-plank building.

Many other settlers came from the Midwestern states during the JB Watkins era of 1880 to 1900. At that time Watkins was spending enormous sums of money promoting his &quot;Garden of Eden&quot; in southwest Louisiana. Among the new settlers were families named Storer, Mayfield, Jones, Phelps, Mayes, Reynolds, Johnson, Harvey, Leeds and Oden.

By 1903, when Kinder officially became a village, other families had arrived. They included Patrick E. Moore, who was appointed the first mayor, and four men who became aldermen Dr. R.E. Oden, Fred Moore, Edoc Roza and J.W. Kingrey.

In 1911, Kinder had a population of 1,088, thereby entitling it to be classified as a town. Gov. Jared Young Sanders proclaimed Kinder a town on March 4, 1911.

The mayors from 1903 on were Patrick Moore, Jack Dempsey, Dr. R.E. Oden, W.C. McNann, M.B. McRill, Randall H. Odom, J. W. Kingrey, S.R. Kingrey, D.T. Slocum, W.D. Horn, William Marcantel, E.E. Migues, Percy LeLand, Lee St. Romain, Cledius LaFargue, Fred Ashy, for whom the municipal building is named, and Estes Ledoux.

Kinder was used as the headquarters for the Blue Army during the Louisiana Maneuvers preceding the United States entry into WWII. A roadside marker commemorates the occasion.

<doc id="115474" wikidata="Q2355094" url="?curid=115474" title="Donaldsonville, Louisiana">
<text>Donaldsonville (historically ) is a city in, and the parish seat of Ascension Parish in the U.S. state of Louisiana. Located along the River Road of the west bank of the Mississippi River, it is a part of the Baton Rouge metropolitan statistical area. At the 2020 U.S. census, it had a population of 6,695.

Donaldsonville&#x27;s historic district has what has been described as the finest collection of buildings from the antebellum era to 1933, of any of the Louisiana river towns above New Orleans. Union forces attacked the city, occupying it and several of the river parishes beginning in 1862. Fort Butler was built on the west bank of the Mississippi River. The fort was successfully defended on June 28, 1863, against a Confederate attack. This battle was one of the first occasions when free blacks and fugitive slaves fought as soldiers on behalf of the Union. The fort is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

After the war, in 1868 Donaldsonville residents elected as mayor Pierre Caliste Landry, an attorney and Methodist minister; he was the first African American to be elected as mayor in the United States.

==History==
The French were the first Europeans to colonize the area. They named the site &quot;Lafourche-des-Chitimachas,&quot; after the regional indigenous people and the local bayou, which they gave the same name. They developed agriculture in the parish, mainly as sugar cane plantations worked by African slave labor.

Acadians, expelled by the British from Acadia in 1755, began to settle in the area from 1756 to 1785, where they developed small subsistence farms. Spanish Isleños also settled here. In 1772 when the territory was under Spanish rule, the militia constructed &quot;La Iglesia de la Ascensión de Nuestro Señor Jesucristo de Lafourche de los Chetimaches&quot; (the Ascension of Our Lord Catholic Church of Lafourche of the Chitimaches) to serve the area. The region returned later to French control for a time.

This area was included in the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and became part of the United States. Americans began to move into the area. Landowner and planter William Donaldson in 1806 commissioned the architect and planner, Barthelemy Lafon, to plan a new town at this site. It was renamed Donaldsonville after him.
Donaldsonville was designated as the Louisiana capital (1829–1831), as the result of conflict between the increasing number of Anglo-Americans, who deemed New Orleans &quot;too noisy&quot; and wanted to move the capital closer to their centers of population farther north in the state, and French Creoles, who wanted to keep the capital in a historically-French area.

As a result of the wealth planters gained from sugar and cotton commodity crops, they built fine mansions and other buildings in town during the antebellum years.

===Civil War===
In the summer of 1862, Donaldsonville was bombarded by Union forces during the American Civil War as part of the Union&#x27;s effort to gain control of the Mississippi River. The Union sent gunboats to the town and warned that if shots were fired, the Union Navy would strike the area for six miles to the south and nine miles to the north and destroy every building on every plantation. Admiral David G. Farragut destroyed much of the former capital city and put Ascension Parish under martial law, extending that to other River parishes.

Historian John D. Winters, in his &quot;The Civil War in Louisiana&quot; (1963), describes the scene:

The irate naval commander, Admiral Farragut, ordered the bombardment of Donaldsonville as soon as it could be evacuated. All of the citizens of Donaldsonville . . . &quot;left their homes and went to the bayou . . . a detachment of Yankees went to shore with fire torches in hand.&quot; The hotels, warehouses, dwellings, and some of the most valuable buildings of the town were destroyed, Plantations . . . were bombarded and set afire. . . . A citizens&#x27; committee met and decided to ask Governor Moore to keep the [Confederate] Rangers from firing on Federal boats. These attacks did no real good and brought only crude reprisals against the innocent and helped to keep the Negroes stirred up.

A citizen complained that the Rangers were useless and lawless, unable or unwilling to protect Confederate property. The citizen added that the Confederate people &quot;could not fare worse were we surrounded by a band of Lincoln&#x27;s mercenary hirelings. Our homes are entered and pillaged of everything that they [Rangers] see fit to appropriate to themselves.&quot;

Union forces established a base at Donaldsonville for their occupation of river parishes. They took over some plantations, running them as U.S. government plantations to supply the forces and produce cotton.

==== Fort Butler ====
Many escaping slaves entered the Union lines to gain freedom. General Benjamin Butler had declared them &quot;contrabands&quot; of war and would not return them to slaveholders. They stayed and worked with Union forces, helping build the star-shaped Fort Butler in the town. A work of earth and wood, it was 381 feet long on the side by the Mississippi River, the other was protected by Bayou Lafourche, and the land sides by a deep moat. A stockade surrounded the fort, which contained a high and thick earth parapet. There was further security from a strong log. The fort was built to accommodate 600 men, but in 1863 there were a small garrison of 180 Union men, commanded by Major Joseph Bullen of the 28th Maine; the forces were also made up of the 1st Louisiana Volunteers, a few Louisiana Native Guard convalescents, and some fugitive slaves.

In June 1863, Confederate forces attacked Fort Butler at night. Led by General Tom Green, more than 1,000 Texas Rangers attacked the fort. Free blacks and fugitive slaves joined in the successful defense of the fort, in one of the first times they fought as soldiers on behalf of the Union. The &quot;New York Tribune&quot; wrote; &quot;When action took place the negroes were stimulated to daring deeds.&quot; Historian Don Frazier, wrote; &quot;Not only did black hands build this citadel of freedom, they defended it to the death.&quot; The Union kept control of the fort and ultimately won the war. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

===Post-Civil War===
After the war, Donaldsonville became the third-largest black community in the state, as more freedmen moved there to join those who had settled near Union forces for safety during the war. In 1868 the city elected the first African-American mayor in the United States, Pierre Caliste Landry, a former slave who been educated in schools on a plantation owned by the Bringier family. After the war, he had advanced to become an attorney and state politician, serving in both houses of the legislature. He also became a Methodist Episcopal minister.

Donaldsonville is the home of one of the oldest synagogue buildings still standing in the United States. The wooden structure was built in 1872 by Congregation Bikur Cholim, which disbanded in the 1940s. It is now used as an Ace Hardware store. The Jewish Cemetery dates to 1800s and is located on the corner of St. Patrick Street and Marchand Drive.

Mechanization of agriculture and other changes resulted in a major loss of population in Ascension Parish from 1900 to 1930, particularly from 1920 to 1930. This was the period of the Great Migration, when tens of thousands of African Americans left the rural South to go for opportunities in northern and midwestern cities. Such changes also drew off business from the parish seat. Ascension Parish lost more than 16% of its population in that decade. In the Great Depression, the area struggled economically.
Historian Sidney A. Marchand, who was also an attorney, was elected as mayor of the city and state legislator during that period. He served as a state Senator and contemporary of Governor Huey Long. During the mayoral administrations of Sidney A. Marchand and his son Sidney Marchand, Jr., they directed the construction of significant infrastructure in Donaldsonville (including about 12 miles of paving, and the still-extant sewerage system). Today the Donaldsonville Historic District has what is described as the &quot;finest collection of buildings from the pre-Civil War to 1933 period&quot; of rivertowns above New Orleans. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In the 21st century, Donaldsonville is a small city with numerous historic sites. Since 2008, the River Road African American Museum, located in the city, has been included on the Louisiana African American Heritage Trail. It also has parks, Civil War grounds, and shopping centers.

The official newspaper of the city is the &quot;Donaldsonville Chief&quot;, which has been published since 1871.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Coming upriver on the Mississippi, Donaldsonville is the point of the first expanse of land beyond the narrow natural levee. The city sits approximately 25 feet above sea level. Donaldsonville is located where Bayou Lafourche, a distributary of the Mississippi River, formerly branched off until the entrance was dammed in 1905.

<doc id="115475" wikidata="Q3139514" url="?curid=115475" title="Gonzales, Louisiana">
<text>Gonzales is a city in Ascension Parish, Louisiana, United States. As of the 2020 census, it has a population of 12,231. Known as the &quot;Jambalaya Capital of the World&quot;, it is famous for its annual Jambalaya Festival, which was first held in 1968. Stephen &quot;Steve&quot; F. Juneau came up with the idea for the Jambalaya Festival and served as the first president of the Jambalaya Festival Association.

==History==
Early European settlers of the area that was developed as Gonzales were, for the most part, of French and Spanish ancestry. They settled among the Houma Indians who lived in the area.

Among the projects and plans carried out by Luis de Unzaga (&quot;Le Conciliateur&quot;) while he was governor of Louisiana between 1769 and 1777 was the promotion of new settlements by Europeans; among them were French Acadians and Málaga in the fertile Mississippi region, and more specifically in the Unzaga Post or &quot;Puesto de Unzaga&quot; that he created in 1771 in Pointe Coupee, the parish of Saint Gabriel in 1773 and Fort Manchac in 1776; the Gonzales people occupied land at the confluence of the aforementioned European settlements.

By 1851, the small European settlement still had only ten residents. A school was established in 1855 by Adlard Gautreaux for the European-American children in the area. By 1886, the settlement had grown, and the citizens of the community elected &quot;Big&quot; José Gonzáles as their sheriff. José&#x27;s son, Joseph &quot;Tee-Joe&quot; (for Petit Joe) Gonzales, opened a general store and post office in May 1887. The post office became known as the Gonzales Post Office.

Construction of the railroad to the village stimulated the growth of Gonzales. When the Louisiana Railway and Navigation Company (LR&amp;N) constructed its rail line through the area, the local post office was already named Gonzales. The rail company executives wanted to name their station Edenborn, after the company&#x27;s owner, Willam Edenborn. The company also wanted to move the station north of the area to New River, Louisiana, then called Belle Hellene. After local residents filed protests with the Louisiana Railroad Commission, the railroad company was ordered to leave the station at Gonzales. The LR&amp;N still tried to change the name to Edenborn. 
But the residents continued to protest and persuaded the Louisiana Legislature to pass a law requiring railroad companies to name their railroad stations the same as the local post offices.

Gonzales was laid out and subdivided in 1906. It was officially incorporated as a village in 1922. Joseph Gonzales was elected as the first mayor. The village continued to grow, with transportation improved by construction of Airline Highway.

Governor Earl K. Long proclaimed Gonzales as a town in 1952, during his term. The town held its first Jambalaya Festival in 1968. Governor John J. McKeithen marked the occasion by proclaiming Gonzales as the &quot;Jambalaya Capital of the World&quot;.

Following the growth of industrial corporations in the area, the town was chartered by the state legislature as a city in 1977.

Gonzales became better known in 2005, after the widespread destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina. The National Guard, and HSUS and other animal rescue groups, established their bases at the fairground in Gonzales. This became their main search and rescue headquarters, as well as the site for holding pets pending return to their families; the animals were rescued from New Orleans and many other locations. Some people were reunited with their lost pets at this site.

<text>Labadieville is a census-designated place (CDP) in Assumption Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 1,854 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Pierre Part Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Labadieville, originally called &quot;Brûlée Labadie&quot;, takes its name from a French pioneer and resident, Jean Louis L&#x27;Abadie. In 1721, there were some fifty warriors of the Chitimacha tribe. During the two decades after 1750, the area around Labadieville was taken up by French and Spanish, joined by Acadians, Isleños and a sprinkling of Germans from the Cote des Allemands or German Coast to the east on the Mississippi River.

In 1843, a mission was established. St. Philomena Catholic Church dates from 1848 as an organized parish, and the first mass was said in the home of Widow Zacharie Boudreaux. The first building was occupied in 1847.

During the Civil War, Labadieville was the scene of the Battle of Georgia Landing, Oct. 27, 1862, between Union forces under Gen. Weitzel and a body of Confederate troops under Brig. Gen. Alfred Mouton. Major General Benjamin F. Butler, commanding Union forces in the Department of the Gulf, launched an expedition into the Bayou Lafourche region to eliminate the Rebel threat from that area, to make sure that sugar and cotton products from there would come into Union hands and, in the future, to use it as a base for other military operations. Gen. Weitzel, Butler&#x27;s protégé, with five regiments from the Reserve Brigade, Department of the Gulf (numbering about 4,000 men), left Carrollton, above New Orleans, on Oct. 24, and went up the Mississippi River in transports conveyed by gunboats. Reaching Donaldsonville the next day, the troops were disembarked. On the 26th, they marched down the Bayou Lafourche to Napoleonville, but were unable to find the Confederate force known to be in that region. On the 27th Gen. Weitzel continued his march to Labadieville, on the east bank of the bayou, where he found the enemy in considerable force entrenched on both sides of the bayou, with six pieces of artillery in battery. Confederate forces included the 18th Louisiana Infantry Regiment, Crescent Regiment, Ralston&#x27;s Battery, Detachment of Cavalry, 33rd Louisiana Infantry Regiment, Terre Bonne Regiment of the Louisiana Militia, Semmes&#x27;s Battery and 2nd Louisiana Cavalry Regiment (approx. 1,392 men).

Gen. Weitzel&#x27;s troops began skirmishing with Confederate positions on the east bank at about 11:00 a.m. Lacking the artillery support of the troops entrenched on the west bank of the bayou, Confederate troops in these positions retired quickly. By means of a floating bridge Gen. Weitzel began crossing his men to the west bank to attack the Rebel troops there. For some time, these Confederate troops fought resolutely and brought the Union assault to a standstill. However, a lack of artillery ammunition compelled the Confederate forces to abandon these positions as well. Confederate forces retreated up the bayou to Labadieville.

Union losses were 18 killed and 68 wounded. Confederate losses were estimated at 229. Additionally, 206 Confederates were taken prisoner. On the 28th Weitzel entered and occupied Thibodaux, a few miles below Labadieville, and on the 29th communication was opened with New Orleans by means of the New Orleans, Opelousas and Great Western Railroad. The result of the expedition was to open the whole region of the Bayou Lafourche to Union occupation.

In 1905, a canal, called the Cancienne, leading east from Lake Verret to Bayou Lafourche near Napoleonville, was constructed.

The first permanent settlements in this region were made by the French and Spanish (including Isleños) about the middle of the 18th century along Bayou Lafourche, between the present towns of Donaldsonville and Napoleonville. From 1755 to 1785, the population was increased by the immigration of the exiled Acadians who settled in the area, clearing the land and building comfortable homes. The town was officially incorporated on March 11, 1878.

<text>Paincourtville is a census-designated place (CDP) in Assumption Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 911 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Legend says an early traveler, unable to buy a single loaf of bread there, facetiously called the place &quot;short of bread town&quot;, which translates to Paincourtville.

The first permanent settlements in this region were made by the French and Spanish (including Isleños), &quot;circa&quot; the mid-18th century along Bayou Lafourche, between the present towns of Donaldsonville and Napoleonville. From 1755 to 1764, the population was increased by the immigration of the exiled Acadians who emigrated to the area, clearing the land and building homes. Many of their descendants remain in the parish today.

On a plot donated by Elizabeth Dugas, St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Church was built in 1840. Parishioners promptly rebuilt their church after a fire in 1854. In 1903 a third structure, still in use, was completed. Nearby on a special steel scaffolding is the church bell, too large for either of the church&#x27;s two towers. It was brought from France.

<text>Pierre Part () is a census-designated place (CDP) in Assumption Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 3,169 at the 2010 census, making it the most populous community in Assumption Parish. With 39.3 percent of the population speaking French at home, Pierre Part is the most French town in the United States (by percentage) outside of Maine. Pierre Part is known locally for its prominent French influence and ancestry, which have become significant aspects of its contemporary local culture. Situated near Lake Verret, Pierre Part is a popular local destination for water sports and fishing during the summer.

==History==

Pierre Part was founded by Acadian French settlers after the Great Upheaval of 1755, during which much of the French population of Acadia was expelled by its British conquerors. The town remained isolated from most of the world, since it was surrounded by water and was inaccessible by land until the mid-twentieth century. Before the Great Depression, the inhabitants of Pierre Part were fishermen; after the Depression, many men of the town were forced to find work in other fields including logging, levee building, and the growing petroleum industry in Louisiana. Fewer people continue the traditional ways of fishing and living off the land with each generation.

Pierre Part experienced flooding when the Morganza Spillway was opened during the 1973 Mississippi River flooding.
The History Channel&#x27;s reality show, &quot;Swamp People&quot;, features the Landry family, a Cajun family who lives in Pierre Part; the series debuted on History in 2010.

On August 3, 2012, the Bayou Corne Sinkhole, situated roughly 3 miles from Pierre Part, appeared. In areas of Pierre Part near the sinkhole, residents reported gaseous odors and strange bubbling in local waterways, prompting Governor Bobby Jindal to issue an evacuation order for the nearby community of Bayou Corne. The sinkhole expanded significantly during the months after it first appeared, invoking fear in residents of Pierre Part due to what was perceived to be an imminent threat to the community. Significantly, the sinkhole continued to grow in the direction of Louisiana Highway 70, the main highway on which most residents drove. Public outrage to the events in Bayou Corne was largely directed towards Texas Brine Company, the salt mining company perceived to be chiefly responsible for the disaster; a class-action lawsuit against Texas Brine ensued. However, a 2018 court ruling declared the fault to be shared between three companies: Occidental Chemical was 50% at fault, Texas Brine was 35% at fault, and Vulcan was 15% at fault. As of 2019, the sinkhole continues to expand, albeit slowly, and the community of Bayou Corne remains deserted, with most homes demolished by demolition companies.

Pierre Part is located at (29.960975, -91.206612). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.37%, is water.

<text>Cottonport is a town in Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 2,006 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Cottonport was founded in the early 19th century. In 1835, Joseph Ducote donated land to be used for a road and school, which was the beginnings of the community. Incorporated in 1888 along the banks of Bayou Rouge (French for &quot;Red Bayou&quot;). In the 19th century, large boats made their way through Cottonport with goods destined for the port of New Orleans. The bayou was deep enough to support the large boats and formed a perfect horseshoe, which allowed vessels to turn around. The boats would deliver cargo into the area and would load crops on board to take to larger ports along the route. The main crop available for exporting at that time was cotton. In fact, because so much cotton was being shipped from the port, early settlers named the village Cottonport.

===Present day===
Today, over 100 years after its incorporation, Cottonport retains many of its picturesque qualities. Although Bayou Rouge is no longer navigable, it continues to be used as a fishing hole. It also serves as the backdrop to the annual Cottonport Christmas Festival, held the second weekend in December, which celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2015.

<text>Marksville is a small city in and the parish seat of Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 5,702 at the 2010 census, an increase of 165 over the 2000 tabulation of 5,537.

Louisiana&#x27;s first land-based casino, Paragon Casino Resort, opened in Marksville in June 1994. It is operated by the federally recognized Tunica-Biloxi Indian Tribe, which has a reservation in the parish.

==History==

The land where Marksville was founded on was once a meeting place, leading to the present day Marksville Prehistoric Indian Site.

Marksville is named after Marc Eliche (Marco Litche or Marco de Élitxe, as recorded by the Spanish), a Sephardic Jewish trader believed to be from Venice, who established a trading post after his wagon broke down in this area. His Italian name was recorded by a Spanish priest as &quot;Marco Litche;&quot; French priests, who were with colonists, recorded his name as &quot;Marc Eliche&quot; or &quot;Mark Eliché&quot; after his trading post was established about 1794. Marksville was noted on Louisiana maps as early as 1809, after the United States acquired the territory in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. Eliche later donated the land that became the Courthouse Square in the center of Marksville.

Marksville&#x27;s population has numerous families of Cajun ancestry, in addition to African Americans, European Americans, and persons of mixed European-African ancestry. Many of the families had ancestors here since the city was incorporated.

Marksville became the trading center of a rural area developed as cotton plantations. After the United States outlawed the Atlantic slave trade in 1808, enslavers purchased African-American slaves through the domestic slave trade; a total of more than one million were transported to the Deep South from the Upper South in the first half of the 19th century. Enslavers typically bought slaves from markets in New Orleans, where they had been taken via the Mississippi River or by the coastal slave trade at sea. Solomon Northup, a free black from Saratoga Springs, New York, was kidnapped and sold into slavery in Louisiana. After being held for nearly 12 years on plantations in Avoyelles Parish, he was freed in 1853 with the help of Marksville and New York officials. Northup&#x27;s memoir, which he published after returning to New York, was the basis of the 2013 movie &quot;12 Years A Slave&quot;, of the same name.

==2015 shooting of Jeremy Mardis==

On March 31, 2017, Judge William Bennett of the 12th Judicial District Court sentenced Stafford to forty years&#x27; imprisonment for the manslaughter of Jeremy Mardis. He was given a concurrent fifteen years for the attempted manslaughter of Christopher Few. Judge Bennett denied Stafford&#x27;s defense request for a new trial. Stafford told the court that he did not know Jeremy was strapped in the front seat of the father&#x27;s vehicle when he fired the fatal shots. Meanwhile, Greenhouse will be tried beginning June 12 on second-degree and attempted second-degree murder counts.

On October 13, 2014, Moreauville passed a ban on several breeds of dogs, including Rottweilers and pit bulls. According to Penn Lemoine, a village alderperson, several Moreauville residents had complained that dogs from those breeds &quot;were basically running along town&quot; and that made the persons unable to &quot;walk along the neighborhoods&quot;. Owners would have had to give up the dogs by December 1 of that year. The law stated that all banned dogs not removed would be seized and taken for &quot;disposition&quot; by that day. O&#x27;Hara Owens, a village resident and the owner of a pit bull, criticized the law. After the story gained widespread attention, the village government &quot;reconsidered&quot; the law, and abandoned the December 1 deadline.

<doc id="115496" wikidata="Q2205803" url="?curid=115496" title="Castor, Louisiana">
<text>Castor is a village in Bienville Parish in north Louisiana, United States. The population was 209 at the 2000 census but increased 23% to 258 in 2010. The median age was 32.2 years. The village was established in 1900. The name &quot;Castor&quot; refers to the genus Castoridae or beaver, a Latin term, contrary to an oral tradition of the word being Native American in origin.

Castor&#x27;s ZIP code is 71016. A number of surrounding smaller villages, both incorporated and not, including Roy, utilize the ZIP code of Castor.

==History==
During the Civil War, Castor supplied salt for the Confederacy. A salt works was operated west of Castor by Alfred P. King. Burrell Hicks Matthews and Alfred P. King ran a post office here called &quot;Salt Spring&quot; between 1849 and 1866. The area supplied hundreds of young men as soldiers during the Civil War, including the Castor Guards and the Bienville Rifles.

Dr. Dempsey Sullivan was a physician who saw patients from horseback. His daughter, Willie Sullivan, married Sam Smith, and the couple had 21 children. All but one of the children who died are interred at the New Ebenezer Cemetery. Mrs. Bonnie Daniel and Mrs. Merlene Young lived the furthest away in Weatherford and Kerrville, Texas, respectively, but they too are buried at Ebenezer.

The Sam and Willie Sullivan Smith family, one of the oldest in Castor, lost six members in a tornado in 1950. Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Elaine Smith, Celia Sullivan (Mrs. Smith&#x27;s sister), Dottie Jo Knotts, and Prentice Little were all killed. The homestead was wiped clean except for a bucket on the water well which remained undisturbed. The Smith family sold most of its land to Jerry &quot;Cotton&quot; Guin, an employee of Libbey Glass in Shreveport, who raised bees there until 2009.

The Louisiana rails to trails project, which extends from Sibley to Winnfield, deconstructed the once Kansas City Southern Railway track to make a recreational nature trail that, on completion, runs through the center of Castor.

The first school in Castor was located in the former Masonic lodge near the site of the present United Methodist Church. By 1912, Castor State Bank joined a small group of businesses on North Front Street. The bank and other buildings burned in 1929. A new bank building, a two-story brick structure, opened with the upper floor reserved for the Masonic lodge. This bank closed in 1933, but the top floor was still maintained by the lodge and the Order of the Eastern Star, which had been chartered in Castor on June 6, 1912. In the winter of 1983, fire destroyed this building, and the lodge records were lost. A new lodge hall was constructed in 1985 across from the Methodist Church.

In the late evening of April 23, 2000, Castor was struck by a tornado with a half-mile-wide path of destruction, which caused massive damage. There were no severe injuries, but the infrastructure damage caused the closure of most small businesses as well as the public school for a period of weeks. Most of the affected buildings were demolished or renovated because of the severe damage.

Discovered in 2007-2008, the Haynesville Shale, one of the largest natural gas deposits in the United States, sits underneath northwest Louisiana, including Castor. A large pocket of the Haynesville Shale was developed at the edge of the village, but an industrial/production accident involving the site damaged the pocket, making it unusable for the time being.

==Geography==
Castor is located at (32.252757, -93.164933).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

===Landscape===
At ground level, Castor seems flat and surrounded by trees; however, in reality it sits in a valley which makes it a dead area for cell phone coverage. Verizon recently constructed a tower within a few miles of the village, allowing satisfactory reception of the Verizon Wireless network.

The active area or center of Castor is the four-way intersection of LA 4/LA 153 and LA 507, but the city limits extend from the light for about a quarter mile in all directions.

Castor Creek is a tributary of Black Lake Bayou, which flows approximately southwest of Castor.

<text>Gibsland is a town in Bienville Parish in northern Louisiana, United States. As of the 2020 census, its population was 773. The town is best known for its connecting railroads, as the birthplace of the defunct historically black Coleman College, and for being the place where notorious criminals Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow were ambushed and killed by Texas Rangers on May 23, 1934.

Gibsland native John McConathy was a champion basketball player at Northwestern State University in Natchitoches, Louisiana, who later was the superintendent for the Bossier Parish School Board, in which capacity he was the guiding force behind the establishment of the $57 million Bossier Parish Community College.

== History ==
=== Coleman College ===
Coleman College (also known as Coleman Academy) was a segregated African American secondary school founded in Gibsland in 1887 by O. L. Coleman; it was the first secondary school for Black students in northern Louisiana. It was affiliated with the Baptist Church, and supported by the American Baptist Home Mission Society. The institution produced primarily teachers and ministers.

The school remained in the community until the Great Depression, in which it closed in 1937. It later re-opened in Shreveport in 1943, and remained there until the 1950s.

=== Railroad history ===
First incorporated in 1889, the Louisiana &amp; North West Railroad Company operates of shortline between Gibsland and McNeil, Arkansas. The LNW interchanges on both ends of the line: with the Union Pacific (former St. Louis Southwestern) in McNeil; and with Kansas City Southern (former MidSouth, ICG) at Gibsland.

For many years the road was well-known among railfans for its unusual stable of F7 &quot;covered wagons&quot;—unusual motive power of choice for a backwoods southern shortline. In the early 1990s, the F units were sold off to various places, gradually replaced by Geeps from various locations. The LNW shops are located at Gibsland, a few hundred yards from one of the busiest interchange diamonds in all of the state. For decades, three different railroads interchanged in Gibsland. The switching activity could get so hectic the daily routine was known among railfans as the &quot;Gibsland Shuffle.&quot;

<text>Mount Lebanon is a town in Bienville Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 83 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Mount Lebanon was probably the first permanent settlement in what is now Bienville Parish. Its pioneers were Baptists from South Carolina who quickly established a church and school. The school became Mount Lebanon University in 1853, but closed during the Civil War to serve as a high school and a Confederate hospital. After the war the school reopened. After years of struggling, it was consolidated in 1906 through the Louisiana Baptist Convention into Louisiana College in Pineville in Rapides Parish in central Louisiana.

The Mount Lebanon Baptist Church was organized in 1837, and the Louisiana Baptist Convention was established there in 1848. One of the Baptist organizers in Mount Lebanon was pastor George Washington Baines, maternal great-grandfather of future U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson. The church building is still in use. The sanctuary is separated down the middle; men would sit on one side of the divide, women on the other. There is a balcony where the slaves were seated.

There are eight houses in the town that are on the National Register of Historic Places, including a building once used as a stagecoach stop and hotel. That was established by Emily Antoinette Bryan Smith around 1848 and is still owned by her direct descendants.

After the railroad was built through Gibsland, north, Mount Lebanon began to decline in population and economic opportunity. The post office was decommissioned in the 1950s.

<text>Ringgold is a town in the U.S. state of Louisiana, in the western half of Bienville Parish. The town of Ringgold is named for United States Army Major Samuel Ringgold. The population of Ringgold was 1,495 at the 2010 census, and 1,370 at the U.S. Census Bureau&#x27;s 2019 estimates, down from 1,601 in 2018. The 2020 U.S. census estimates program recorded a population of 1,336, though the census established a population of 1,379. It is the second largest incorporated municipality in Bienville Parish by population.

== History ==
It is unlikely that René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in his 1687 journey into Louisiana ever set foot in Bienville Parish. In 1690, the Ringgold area was explored by the scout Domingo Terán de los Ríos, whom the government of Mexico sent to determine the extent of the holdings of the Caddo Indians. He was considered the first white leader to sight what became the man-made Lake Bistineau. A priest with the expedition, Father Masinettes, established &quot;Mission Loretteto.&quot; De los Rios was thereafter from 1891 to 1892 the first governor of Spanish Texas.

In November 1933, C. E. Tomme, a telephone executive who was previously a county commissioner of Newton County in East Texas, was appointed mayor of Ringgold by Governor Oscar K. Allen. Tomme, who relocated to Ringgold in 1920, filled the position vacated by his fellow Democrat, Walter McDowell. Tomme previously served on the Bienville Parish School Board and the parish Democratic Executive Committee. In the spring of 1934, Tomme won election to the post, 86-66, over Dave Thomas.

In 1933, African American Nelson Nash was lynched and hung in the town. He died protecting his wife.

Ringgold became the home of a Southland Christian Ministries camp and retreat located on a 23-acre lake off U.S. Route 371 north of the community. Initially constructed during the early 1940s by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the facility was purchased in the middle 1940s by the Bible Memory Association, which then operated &quot;Miracle Camp&quot; until it was closed for financial reasons in the early 1990s. Southland subsequently obtained the property with help of the Tri-City Baptist Church of Independence, Missouri. Michael Dale &quot;Mike&quot; Herbster (born March 1974) became camp director in 2008.

On May 2, 1984, a tornado devastated part of Ringgold. Nine were injured, though there were no deaths. The storm reached as far as nearby Jamestown. On March 25, 2017, the Ringgold Assembly of God Church under pastor Martha B. Grigg (born February 1944) was destroyed in a tornado. There were no injuries.

In 2018, the town of Ringgold was highlighted in the media for drug activity, citing lack of economic growth. Since then, the Mayor Milton Vining Administration has collaborated with the local community in an effort to reduce poverty and drugs, and attract local businesses.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Ringgold&#x27;s government enforced a curfew, and local African American student Antavion Moore became Louisiana&#x27;s Student of the Year from 2019-2020.

<text>Saline is a village in southeastern Bienville Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 277 at the 2010 census. Saline is pronounced &quot;Suh-LEEN&quot;.

Jamie Fair, a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives from 1980–1984, resides between Saline and Castor off Louisiana Highway 9.

Former Second Judicial District Court Judge David T. Caldwell, based in Jonesboro, was born in Saline and graduated from Saline High School in 1942.

A branch of Sabine State Bank operates in Saline.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of 1.2 square miles (3.1 km), all land.

The biggest attraction to Saline is the Mill Creek Reservoir. Usually misnamed as Saline Lake, it is the biggest, easiest to access and safest body of water in Bienville Parish. The waters are fairly deep and were long ago cleared of trees and tree stumps, making it ideal for boating, skiing, knee-boarding and other water activities. The only danger in the area is the spillway which is a tower that rises about off the water. It has a ladder that goes to the top and some people climb it to jump off, but it is very unsafe and has claimed lives.

==Churches and cemeteries==
Saline has several Baptist congregations, including Old Saline Baptist, whose original pastor was George Washington Baines, maternal great-grandfather of U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson. Within Saline is the Magnolia Baptist Church. Several miles east of Saline off Louisiana Highway 155 is Carolina Baptist Church. All three rural churches have accompanying cemeteries.

The average household size was 2.67 and the average family size was 3.13.

In the village, the population was spread out, with 30.1% under the age of 18, 9.5% from 18 to 24, 25.0% from 25 to 44, 19.9% from 45 to 64, and 15.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females, there were 102.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 91.7 males.

The median income for a household in the village was $26,500, and the median income for a family was $31,250. Males had a median income of $26,458 versus $16,719 for females. The per capita income for the village was $11,364. About 17.3% of families and 21.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 26.1% of those under the age of eighteen and 17.2% of those 65 or over.

==Arts and culture==
The Saline Watermelon Festival is Louisiana&#x27;s oldest watermelon festival. With cotton prices declining in the 1920s, local farmers searched for more profitable crops. They created the Saline Dairy &amp; Truck Growers Association and diversified their yields, growing fruits and vegetables – most notably, watermelons. This led to Louisiana’s first watermelon festival, held in 1931, to celebrate the harvest. Customers included President Franklin Roosevelt and King George V of the United Kingdom.

The festivals, originally held on Fridays, drew huge crowds from distant places who would come in via the train or car. People came to play games, eat watermelon, gather with old friends, and enjoy their day mingling around. In 1933, the festival attracted approximately 10,000 people but with the onset of the depression, this was to be the last annual watermelon festival to be held in the town for 50 years.

In 1983, after many months of work by Carolyn Dison, Gertie Baker, Gertrude Enloe, Elizabeth Dushane, and Betty Wiggins, the festival was held once again and became an annual event. Now, held on the second Saturday in July, you will find an event-filled week. From beauty pageants to live music, an antique car show to an old-fashioned parade, arts &amp; crafts vendors to your favorite food vendors, there is something for everyone. Then on Saturday night, the festival comes to an end with an old-fashioned street dance where you can dance the night away.

==Media==
For several years, Mill Creek Reservoir was the camping spot for international cross-country motorcycle racers who, once a year, would race through the neighboring properties for a timed race. Starting at the crossroads in Saline, under the traffic light which is only a stop sign now, racers would race through the area forests for approximately 6-8 hours, if they didn’t get lost, then back to The Watergate where the finish line was located. The winners of “The Great Saline Enduro” were determined by who had the fastest time it took to complete the course. This one event brought in people from several different countries.

In 1988, Saline was transformed into a movie set for the filming of a movie named “Blaze”, starring Paul Newman. During his time in the town, Mr Newman was shown around the area by the local sheriff Reed Williams. Newman expressed admiration for a pair of new puppies the sheriff’s dog had recently birthed, so the sheriff gave him the male/female pair. For years, these two pups could be seen on the labels of Paul Newman’s Own Salad Dressing.
==Education==
Saline has one school, a modern structure that houses elementary, middle, and high school buildings.

<doc id="115504" wikidata="Q877897" url="?curid=115504" title="Bossier City, Louisiana">
<text>Bossier City ( ) is a city in Bossier Parish in the northwestern region of the state of Louisiana in the United States. It is the second-most populous city in the Shreveport–Bossier City metropolitan statistical area. In 2020, it had a total population of 62,701, up from 61,315 in 2010.

Located on the eastern bank of the Red River, Bossier City is closely tied economically and socially to its larger sister city Shreveport on the western bank. The parish operates its own community college, Bossier Parish Community College.

==History==

===19th century===
In the 1830s, the area of Bossier City was the plantation Elysian Grove, which was purchased by James Cane and his second wife Mary Doal Cilley Bennett Cane. 

Cane had come to the area with his first wife Rebecca Bennett, and her brother, William Bennett, and his wife Mary Doal (née Cille)y Bennett. They ran a trading post across the river on what was then Caddo Indian territory, a portion called &quot;Bennett&#x27;s Bluff&quot;. The trading post partners became a one-seventh partner in the new Shreve Town, which eventually developed as Shreveport.

Like most plantations, Elysian Grove had frontage on the Red River for access to transportation for shipping cotton and other commodities. The Texas Trail crossed the Red River at this point. The trading post on the west side operated a ferry between what would become Shreveport and Bossier City. The plantation loading and unloading dock was later recorded as &quot;Cane&#x27;s Landing&quot; in the old ferry log books. For a very short time, Cane&#x27;s Landing was known as Cane City. 

The Canes and Bennetts were among the earliest European-American ettlers in the area. Mary D. C. Bennett gave birth to the first white baby of the area, William Smith Bennett Jr. He died at an early age.

In 1843, a section of land east of the Red River was divided from the Great Natchitoches District and Claiborne Parish areas and was called Bossier Parish. It was named in honor of Pierre Evariste John Baptiste Bossier, a former Creole general, who became a cotton planter in Bossier Parish. Of ethnic French descent, he was one of the first European settlers in the area after most of the Native Americans had been forcibly removed by the federal government.

In the 1840s, the Great Western Migration of Americans and immigrants from the East and Upper South began. The parish grew in population. Many early settlers passed through the region on their way to the Western U.S. By 1850, more than 200 wagons a week passed through Bossier City, with many travelers from the Upper South intending to settle in Texas. Some of these settlers stayed in Louisiana, attracted by the fertile soil and river valley. In 1850, the U.S. census listed the population of Bossier City (?) at 6,962.

===American Civil War===
During the American Civil War, companies of Confederate soldiers shipped out of Cane&#x27;s Landing aboard steamboats for distant battlefields. Mrs. Cane hosted hundreds of Confederate officers and troops who were heading off to war. Mrs. Cane&#x27;s plantation was fortified to protect Shreveport by three batteries, with Fort Kirby Smith in the center. The others were Batteries Price, and Walker and Ewell.

Fort Smith protected the area from an eastern invasion. The American Civil War reached Bossier Parish in 1861, and ended in Shreveport four years later, when the Trans-Mississippi Department surrendered. In the 20th century, Bossier High School was constructed near the former site of the fort.

===Shed Road===
Shed Road, the first all-weather turnpike in the American South, was constructed in the 1870s and operated from 1874 to 1886. It extended for from Red Chute to the Red River. The elevated and covered roadway led to a plantation that was accessible by a ferry. The covered road made the transportation of goods easier before the arrival of the railroads.

===Classification as a city===
Anna B., granddaughter of James and Mary Cane, felt the area would prosper and began promoting the idea of a riverfront city. Anna B. and J. J. Stockwell sold lots in 1883. The area grew quickly, as did transportation through it. At the time, the unincorporated settlement was often called Cane City. 

Around 1907, Cane City was incorporated by Louisiana Governor Newton C. Blanchard; the village was renamed as Bossier City. Blanchard appointed Ewald Max Hoyer, a Shreveport businessman, as the first Bossier City mayor. By that time, Bossier City had grown from an area around a square mile to a city containing more than . Continued growth led to Bossier City&#x27;s being reclassified from village to town by Governor John M. Parker. Later, Governor Earl Kemp Long issued a proclamation classifying Bossier City as a city.

The &quot;golden spike&quot; commemorated the completion of the east–west Vicksburg, Shreveport and Pacific Railroad. It was driven at Bossier City on July 12, 1884, by Julia &quot;Pansy&quot; Rule. It was the first such spike to be driven by a woman. The north–south Shreveport and Arkansas Railroad was completed on April 6, 1888. The Louisiana–Arkansas Railroad was completed on November 2, 1909. The Dixie Overland Highway from the East to the West Coast was built in 1918. These railroads and highways combined to make Bossier City a hub for future activity.

The discovery of crude oil, to the south, in 1908, thrust Bossier City into the nationwide oil boom. Bossier&#x27;s central location to the rural oil fields made it a major player in the oil patch. Several international oil companies were located in the area. The advantages brought by black gold fueled many civic, social and economic improvements.

A fire on June 23, 1925, consumed one-half of downtown Bossier City. Local citizens were unable to battle the blaze. The loss spurred civic improvements, including a modern water system capable of fighting such fires, a new city hall, a modern fire alarm system, modern sidewalks, and the first city park.

In the 1930s, construction began on Barksdale Airfield (now Barksdale Air Force Base). In 1929 the land on which the base is built was unincorporated property south of Bossier City. The city of Shreveport annexed the land and donated it to the federal government. Through the years, Bossier City expanded, eventually encompassing the area surrounding the base. The first unit assigned to Barksdale was the 20th Pursuit Group. Before World War II, Barksdale was a training school for the Army Air Corps. 

During World War II, Barksdale trained pilots, navigators, and bombardiers. Later, the base became one of the key bases of the Strategic Air Command in the new Air Force. Today Barksdale is the headquarters for the 8th Air Force.

In the 1890s, Cane City had a population of about 600. Bossier City in 2012 had an estimated population of over 64,000. First a cotton-exporting river landing, next a railroad town, then an airbase and oil-boom town, Bossier City has become known for its tourism and casino gambling.

Three casinos in the city have financed a number of municipal projects, many completed during the administration of the late Mayor George Dement. Recent improvements include the CenturyLink Center, Louisiana Boardwalk, Benton Road Overpass, and the Arthur Ray Teague Parkway, located along the eastern side of the Red River. Dement also procured Amtrak service between Bossier City and Dallas, Texas. 

In 2005 Dement was succeeded as mayor by Lo Walker, his former administrative assistant and mayoral opponent from 1989, the first Republican politician to hold the city&#x27;s top executive position.

=== Growth and redevelopment ===
On April 20, 2017, in their joint &quot;State of Bossier&quot; address, hosted by the Bossier Chamber of Commerce, Mayor Lo Walker, and Bossier Parish Police Jury President Bob Brotherton described the growth of the city and parish as &quot;outstanding.&quot; With a population of 69,000 in a 2015 study by Louisiana State University, Bossier City had become the sixth-largest city in the state and the fastest-growing one.

Walker said that the city and the parish &quot;work extremely close together, and our business and civic leaders and military make us an outstanding parish.&quot; The parish grew at 19%; the city grew at 10%. According to the Bossier Economic Development Foundation, the city could have reached 80,000 by 2019. Ongoing projects contributing to growth include the Walter O. Bigby Carriageway (the north parkway extension named for former state representative and judge Walter O. Bigby), Shed Road construction, and the South Bossier redevelopment districts.

The city has a slightly above-average rate of tornadoes when compared to the U.S. average. Due to the flat topography of the city and the prominence of smaller waterways that are prone to backwater flooding from the Red River, the city occasionally experiences severe flooding events.

Freezes and ice storms regularly occur during the winters.

<doc id="115507" wikidata="Q2638160" url="?curid=115507" title="Plain Dealing, Louisiana">
<text>Plain Dealing is a town in Bossier Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 893 in 2020. It is part of the Shreveport–Bossier City metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
Prior to 1839, the United States government forcibly removed the Caddo Nation of Native Americans—longtime local inhabitants who had first settled the area over 1,000 years before Europeans&#x27; 16th-century arrival in mainland North America—from the area of Northern Louisiana that included the parcel that would later become the town of Plain Dealing.

In 1839, George Oglethorpe Gilmer and his son, James Blair Gilmer, bought 5,000 acres of this land—then described as a &quot;vast, unsettled wilderness&quot;—from the United States government, calling a portion of this acreage &quot;Plain Dealing&quot; after the family&#x27;s Virginia plantation. The &quot;Plain Dealing&quot; name became official when the town was formally chartered on April 24, 1890.

On March 26, 1893, during an evening school dance at Plain Dealing High School, a fight broke out. Two students were shot and killed immediately, two more were fatally wounded, and the high school&#x27;s Professor Johnson was wounded in the arm.

==Geography==
Plain Dealing is south of the Arkansas border and north of Shreveport.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which , or 0.26%, is water.

===Climate===

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Plain Dealing has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps. The hottest temperature recorded in Plain Dealing was on August 10, 1936, while the coldest temperature recorded was on February 13, 1899. The record high temperature is also the highest temperature ever recorded in Louisiana.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 893 people, 424 households, and 192 families residing in the town.

==Education==
The community is in the Bossier Parish School District. There is one school in the community, Plain Dealing High School, which covers grades Pre-Kindergarten through 12. Its attendance boundary includes all of Plain Dealing.

White and black students had separate K-12 schools, under educational segregation in the United States. White students went to Plain Dealing High School, then K-12, while black students went to Carrie Martin High School, a K-12 school established in 1952 by its namesake.

<doc id="115512" wikidata="Q2341209" url="?curid=115512" title="Greenwood, Louisiana">
<text>Greenwood is a suburban town in southern Caddo Parish, which is located in the northwest corner of the U.S. state of Louisiana. With a population of 3,166 at the 2020 United States census, it is the third most populous incorporated municipality in Caddo Parish after Shreveport and Blanchard. Part of the Shreveport-Bossier City metropolitan statistical area, it is located 15 miles west of downtown Shreveport.

==History==
Greenwood was established by European Americans in 1839 after the forced Indian Removal of the Caddo people to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma) west of the Mississippi River.
As in the rest of Louisiana, most Black or African Americans were disenfranchised from the turn of the 20th century into the 1960s, and the state was dominated by white Democrats; Caddo Parish Sheriff J. Howell Flournoy, who served a record 26 years in office from 1940 to 1966, was born in Greenwood in 1891 and was part of the political Flournoy dynasty.

Earnest Lampkins (1928–2018), a native of Shreveport, earned a PhD and had a career as a music educator. He taught music at all levels, becoming supervisor of music for Caddo Parish. He founded the Louisiana School of Professions. In 2004, Lampkins was elected as the first black mayor of Greenwood, where he had long been active in the community. Against running for a second term, Lampkins ceased any intentions due to gunshots fired into his house, alongside continued threats and racism.

== Geography ==
Greenwood is located in western Caddo Parish at (32.436051, -93.963902). Greenwood Road (U.S. Routes 80 and 79) is the main route through the center of town. Interstate 20 passes through the northern part of the town, with access from exits 3 and 5. Downtown Shreveport is to the east, and Waskom, Texas, is to the west. Carthage, Texas, is to the southwest down U.S. 79. Greenwood is approximately 165 miles east of Dallas, Texas, and about 290 miles northwest of New Orleans.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Greenwood has a total area of , of which , or 0.19%, is water.

==Demographics==
Since the establishment of Greenwood, its population was overshadowed by the larger and nearby Shreveport to its east, and Waskom, Texas to the west; at the 1970 United States census, the town of Greenwood had a population of 212. In 2020, the U.S. Census Bureau tabulated a population of 3,166, down from the historic high of 3,219 at the 2010 United States census. At the publication of the 2020 census, Greenwood remained the third largest community in Caddo Parish, while Blanchard overtook Vivian as the second-largest.
There were 1,351 households at the 2020 American Community Survey&#x27;s 5 year estimates program, among which 755 were married-couple households. The average family size was 2.80, and the average household size was 2.34; in 2000, the average household size was 2.55 and the average family size was 3.00.

About 9.3% of families and 13.3% of the population were below the poverty line, including 19.3% of those under age 18 and 20.9% of those age 65 or over. In 2018, the American Community Survey determined the median income was $60,809; the mean income was $91,984, making Greenwood one of the wealthiest communities within the Shreveport-Bossier City metropolitan area. During the American Community Survey&#x27;s 2020 census estimates, its median household income was $55,034; the mean income also slightly declined to $86,979.

=== Race and ethnicity ===

For a majority of Greenwood&#x27;s history, the town has been predominantly non-Hispanic white, though diversification has broadened the racial and ethnic makeup of the suburban community alongside much of the United States.

The growing Hispanic or Latino American population reflected nationwide demographic trends following the 2014 to 2019 census estimates and 2020 census.

=== Religion ===
According to &quot;Sperling&#x27;s BestPlaces&quot; in 2020, the population of Greenwood has remained primarily Christian. Dominated by Protestantism as most of North and Central Louisiana, Baptists were the largest Christian tradition by adherence. Baptists in Greenwood are mainly served by the Southern Baptist Convention, though the predominantly Black or African American National Baptist Convention of America and National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. have congregations throughout the area. Following, Methodists and Pentecostals dominated the religious landscape, with Catholic Christians served by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Shreveport.

<text>Hosston is a village in Caddo Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 318 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Shreveport–Bossier City Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Hosston is located in northern Caddo Parish at (32.886777, -93.881364), west of the Red River and east of Black Bayou Lake. U.S. Route 71 runs through the center of the village, leading south to Shreveport and north to the Arkansas line at Ida. Louisiana Highway 2 runs west from Hosston to Vivian and east to Plain Dealing.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Hosston has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.94%, is water.

===History===
Hosston, Louisiana, owes its origins to the pioneering efforts of the Hoss family, particularly James M. Hoss Sr., who played a pivotal role in its founding and early development. The town&#x27;s history is intertwined with the contributions of other notable figures, such as Noah Tyson and George W. Hale, whose endeavors further shaped the growth of Hosston.

The roots of Hosston can be traced back to the mid-1800s when Nathan Hoss, a prominent merchant, established himself in the region during its early settlement phase. His son, James M. Hoss Sr., would later become instrumental in the town&#x27;s development. Alongside other members of the Hoss family who had migrated from Tennessee and settled in the area, James fostered the growth of the settlement.

During this period, James Hoss garnered renown as a well-known commissioner, collaborating with Noah Tyson, a key figure responsible for the development of much of Rodessa, LA. The two entrepreneurs joined forces and made significant contributions to the expansion and improvement of the region&#x27;s infrastructure.

Evidence from historical documents suggests that James Hoss and Noah Tyson worked together on several ventures, including a store. A testament to Tyson&#x27;s influence is the Noah Tyson Park, situated on Mira Myrtis Rd, which stands as a reminder of his legacy.

Despite James Hoss&#x27;s vital contributions, the northern settlement of Hosston was also significantly influenced by his cousin, George W. Hale. George&#x27;s efforts in the early 1900s played a crucial role in the continued progress of Hosston. On May 16, 1890, the Hale Post Office was established, with James Hale serving as the Postmaster. He diligently delivered mail to residents living along the Black Bayou Lake, fostering connectivity in the area.

As more people moved to Hosston, the community&#x27;s infrastructure and skilled workforce continued to grow, further propelling the settlement&#x27;s development. The population&#x27;s expansion and increased importance warranted the establishment of a post office, high school, and several other community buildings for Hosston, reflecting the town&#x27;s ongoing progress and promising future.

Today there are an unknown number of descendants of Nathan K Hoss. However, there are many descendants of Nathan&#x27;s grandfather, Jacob Hoss of Tennessee, who live around the Hosston area.

<text>Rodessa is a village in Caddo Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 270 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Shreveport–Bossier City Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Very little is known on the early days of the settlement as it is believed that Rodessa began as a trading post in the mid-1800s. Locals state that the town was originally named Frog Level as during a town meeting frogs were loudly croaking in a nearby pond. A post office was constructed in 1879, however it may have been in place earlier. By 1898 the Kansas City Southern Railway was built through the area which spurred an increase in population. Rodessa was incorporated as a village in the same year.
In the modern era, Rodessa is locally known for its inspiration for the name of the Rodessa Oilfield. The 2,779 acre field stretches from western Louisiana into Cass County and Marion County, Texas. Despite the field being discovered in and named after a village in Louisiana, the majority of the drilling takes place in Texas. Drilling began in 1936 and has continued into the modern day. By 1947 the original oil drill was removed in Rodessa and now a miniature oilfield marker stands as a monument by the modern post office and the abandoned Rodessa Oilfield Museum.

In February, 1938 northwestern Louisiana faced a F4 tornado that destroyed a large portion of Rodessa and left 21 people dead and many more injured.

In the early hours of November 1, 2023 the Caddo Parish Sheriff’s Office responded to a call that 10 train cars owned by Canadian Pacific Kansas City had derailed just north of the village. No deaths or injuries were reported and the only outcome was the temporary closure of LA-1 between United Gas Company Road 3 and Rodessa-State Line Road.

==Geography==
Rodessa is located in northwestern Caddo Parish at (32.971486, -93.995941). It is the incorporated place in Louisiana closest to the state&#x27;s northwest corner. Louisiana Highway 1 passes through the village, leading south to Vivian and northwest to Atlanta, Texas (as Texas State Highway 77).

According to the United States Census Bureau, Rodessa has a total area of , all land.

The racial makeup of the village was 70.36% White, 27.69% African American, 1.63% Native American, and 0.33% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.33% of the population.

==History==

DeQuincy was founded in 1897 as a railroad town with the Calcasieu, Vernon &amp; Shreveport Railway Company (CV&amp;S) having been completed and Arthur Stilwell&#x27;s Kansas City, Shreveport &amp; Gulf Railway Company (KCS&amp;G), that was owned by the Kansas City, Pittsburg and Gulf Railroad (KCP&amp;G), completed in 1897.

On 8 March 1944, two Air Force aircraft from nearby Barksdale Air Force Base collided overhead killing seven people.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 3,144 people, 972 households, and 720 families residing in the city.

DeQuincy was founded as a railroad settlement, and the Kansas City Southern and Union Pacific railroads remain principal employers for area citizens.

The timber industry has long been a vital part of the local economy. DeQuincy is home to Temple-Inland&#x27;s Southwest Louisiana Lumber Operation.

The DeQuincy Industrial Airpark houses facilities for Thermoplastic Services, Recycle Inc., United Oilfield Services, and Paragon Plastic Sheet.

==Subject of multiple hoaxes==
The town has been the subject of numerous hoaxes by satirical writer Paul Horner, widely spread on the Internet. The hoaxes claim the town enacted bizarre legislation such as banning those of Korean descent, issuing handguns to school children, permitting bigamy, banning twerking, and the city being completely eradicated by zombies on bath salts.

DeQuincy Mayor Lawrence Henagan, a Democrat, was falsely targeted in 2016 by an Internet hoax that he had jailed a volunteer fire chief for thirty days and then dismissed the man after the chief had prayed at the scene of a fire. The story identified the mayor as &quot;Lawana Jones, an African-American atheist&quot; and the fire chief as &quot;39-year-old Ronnie Edwards.&quot; Henagan, the chairman of the deacon board at the First Baptist Church of DeQuincy, said that the chief is free to pray while firefighting. Henagan said he would join the fire chief in prayer. Henagan said that he has no knowledge why he was singled out for a fake news article but noted that he could take no legal action because the reports used fictitious names.

<text>Iowa () is a town in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 3,436 in 2020. It is part of the Lake Charles metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
The history of this region is filled with stories of the early Midwestern settlers from Kansas, Illinois and Iowa, of the Acadians (Cajuns), and of Jean Lafitte&#x27;s pirates. The community of Iowa was developed in the mid-19th century.

The railroad that cut through this country brought settlers who were lured to the prairie land for rice farming, cattle raising and later oil fields. Much of southwest Louisiana was developed by the North American Land and Timber Co. Seaman A. Knapp, president of the Iowa State College of Agriculture, was engaged in 1885 to demonstrate the suitability of the region for rice production. Knapp attracted a number of Iowans to settle the area. The settlers were lured to this area by advertisements published in newspapers in the midwestern states.

Iowa experienced a growth boom when oil was struck in 1930 and oil companies came to try their luck in the Iowa oil and gas fields. Even though this was the Great Depression era, Iowa thrived as more men came to work in the oil fields.

Today, oil continues to be a vital part of the town&#x27;s economy, as are farming and cattle.

The town of &quot;Iowa&quot; is actually pronounced with the long A sound at the end (&quot;EYE-uh-way&quot;), opposed to the pronunciation of the state of Iowa.

==Geography==
Iowa is located along the eastern edge of Calcasieu Parish at (30.237433, -93.014191). The eastern border of the town is the Jefferson Davis Parish line.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town of Iowa has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.80%, is water.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 3,436 people, 1,211 households, and 812 families residing in the town.

== Education ==
Iowa High School serves students both in Iowa and the surrounding area as part of the Calcasieu Parish Public Schools.

==Transportation ==
U.S. Route 90 passes through the center of town as 4th Street, and Interstate 10 passes along the northern edge, with access from exits 43 and 44. The southern terminus of U.S. Route 165 is at US 90 on the eastern town border. Lake Charles is to the west via Highways 90 or 10, and Lafayette is to the east. US 165 leads northeast to Alexandria.

<text>Lake Charles is the fifth-most populous city in the U.S. state of Louisiana, and the parish seat of Calcasieu Parish, located on Lake Charles, Prien Lake, and the Calcasieu River. Founded in 1861 in Calcasieu Parish, it is a major industrial, cultural, and educational center in the southwest region of the state. As of the 2020 U.S. census, Lake Charles&#x27;s population was 84,872.

The city and metropolitan area of Lake Charles is considered a regionally significant center of petrochemical refining, gambling, tourism, and education, being home to McNeese State University and Sowela Technical Community College. Because of the lakes and waterways throughout the city, metropolitan Lake Charles is often called the &quot;Lake Area&quot;.

==History==

On March 7, 1861, Lake Charles was incorporated as the town of Charleston, Louisiana.

Lake Charles was founded by merchant and tradesman Marco Eliche (or Marco de Élitxe) as an outpost. He was a Sephardic Jewish trader of either Basque-Spanish or Venetian-Italian origins. He had arrived in Louisiana after hitchhiking, and was invited onto a Spanish vessel due to his determination and loyalty to volunteer and work freely for the Spanish Empire. Long before incorporation and even before the Louisiana Purchase, other names for Lake Charles were Porte du Lafitte&#x27; (Port of Jean Lafitte) or Rivière Lafitte (River Lafitte/Lafitte&#x27;s River), among many other names now lost. Eliche had also founded other outposts and towns in Louisiana prior, most notably Marksville, which is named after him. Also, some urban tales indicate he had planned to name the settlement Nouveau Cadix (New Cádiz)&quot;, after the city in Spain, but this is uncertain.

The town was first incorporated in 1857 as Charleston, after an early settler, Charles Sallier. On March 16, 1867, Charleston was reincorporated as the City of Lake Charles. The Great Fire of April 1910 devastated much of the city.

Lake Charles soon rebuilt, grew and expanded in the 20th century. The Charleston Hotel was completed in 1929, during the administration of Mayor Henry J. Geary. During and after World War II, Lake Charles experienced industrial growth with the arrival of petrochemical refineries. The city grew to a high of some 75,000 people in the early 1980s, but with local economic recession, the population declined and stagnated. In 1985, the city was identified as a potential Strategic Homeport to support Navy Secretary John Lehman&#x27;s desire for a 600-ship Navy. Support ships were to be operated from the new Naval Station Lake Charles, but with the tailing-off of the Cold War, the 1988 Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended it be closed. By 1991, the incomplete base was dropped from the program and shuttered.

In 2005, the city was heavily damaged by Hurricane Rita. In 2020, it was battered by two hurricanes, category 4 Hurricane Laura on August 26–27, and Hurricane Delta on October 9, 2020. Lake Charles after the hurricanes was described as if &quot;20 tornadoes came in and wiped the city&quot;.

The southern portion of the city was damaged by an EF2 tornado on October 27, 2021, and an EF1 tornado caused minor damage to downtown Lake Charles on May 13, 2024.

The Lake Charles Regional Airport had a gust of 128 miles per hour (206 km/h), and several hangars were destroyed. Another gust in the city reached 137 mph (220 km/h). Many windows were blown out of Capital One Tower downtown. A communications tower collapsed onto the KPLC studio building (which had been evacuated), and part of a sky bridge was blown out. The radar at the NWS Lake Charles forecast office (whose staff evacuated, with the office&#x27;s operations transferred to the Brownsville, Texas, office) was destroyed around the time of landfall, with its dome and much of its internal equipment sheared from the radar tower&#x27;s base. A few weeks later, Hurricane Delta also hit Lake Charles.

=== Mardi Gras ===
Mardi Gras in Lake Charles has a long history dating back to 1882, when Momus, King of Mardi Gras, landed his royal yacht at the foot of Pujo Street downtown. Throughout the two World Wars, Mardi Gras was downsized which led to a lack of participation by the area&#x27;s youth. However, an interest in redeveloping the festivities arose, and the first Mardi Gras Ball in Lake Charles was staged in 1964. The full revival of Mardi Gras in Lake Charles was not realized until 1979, when several Krewe captains formed the &quot;Krewe of Krewes&quot;, with the primary purpose of parading and promoting Mardi Gras for local residents.

The Calcasieu River Bridge crosses the Calcasieu River and part of lake. Featuring decorative flintlock pistols on the railing, it is high. About 50,000 vehicles pass over it daily. Despite its age of over 60 years, it is considered safe by the Louisiana DOTD.

Interstate 210 is an interstate highway bypass that loops through the southern portion of the city. The curving Israel LaFleur Bridge goes over the Calcasieu Ship Channel.

<text>Sulphur () is a city in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 21,809 in 2020. Sulphur is part of the Lake Charles metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
Sulphur is named for the sulfur mines that were operated in the area in the 1900s. In 1867, Professor Eugene W. Hilgard, an experienced geologist who was prospecting for oil and other minerals, conducted exploratory borings in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana and discovered sulfur in the caprock of a salt dome. However, the sulfur was beneath several hundred feet of muck and quicksand containing deadly hydrogen sulfide gas, which made mining extremely hazardous. Repeated unsuccessful attempts to sink conventional mining shafts in the 1870s and 1880s resulted in the loss of many lives.

In 1890, the German immigrant Herman Frasch invented and patented the Frasch Process of mining sulfur, using concentric pipes to pump superheated water into the ground, liquefy the mineral, and force the liquid to the surface with compressed air. The first molten sulfur was brought to the surface on Christmas Eve of 1894. Sulfur soon began to be mined on an industrial scale, with the molten mineral allowed to solidify and dry in enormous vats 100 by 400 feet, then blasted and hauled by rail to the Sabine River for shipment. Frasch&#x27;s invention greatly facilitated sulfur mining, and the Union Sulphur Company, a joint venture of Dr. Frasch and the American Sulphur Company that owned the land, sparked a period of booming growth in the decades that followed. The elementary school on South Huntington Street in downtown Sulphur is named after Frasch.

With the addition of the Cities Service (Citgo) oil refinery in 1943, the areas of Maplewood and Hollywood were developed to house refinery workers. The Sulphur area is still mostly dependent on the oil refineries and petrochemical plants for employment.

==Geography==
Sulphur is located near the center of Calcasieu Parish. The city lies on Interstate 10 between the towns of Vinton and Westlake, approximately east of the Texas border. The city of Lake Charles is to the east. U.S. Route 90 passes through the center of Sulphur as Napoleon Street. Access from I-10 is via exits 20, 21, 23, and 26. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Communities inside Sulphur city limits include, from west to east, old Sulphur, Hollywood, and Maplewood, as well as Northwest Sulphur, also known as Portie Town, but usually pronounced with the Cajun form of &quot;pō-chay&quot; or &quot;Pohchay&quot; town. Outside of city limits are the communities of Carlyss and Choupique (Shoe-peak). Like the bowfin, that has many alternate names, the word &quot;Choupique&quot; has several variations of pronunciation in south Louisiana. Choupique is also pronounced &quot;shoe-pick&quot;, shoe-peg, or chew-pic. Moss Lake to the south. The community of Houston River is north of town, and Mossville is east of town, all but a memory with Sasol&#x27;s purchase of over 4 square miles of land, that included with a few property exceptions, the entire community of Mossville. Most new development in the city is taking place south of town in Carlyss or around I-10.

===Wildlife===
The bayous near Sulphur are habitat for American alligators, which have been known to enter into the city.

===Climate===

The climate for Sulphur, and climate data, closely mirrors that of the National Weather Service&#x27;s Lake Charles Weather Forecast Office measured at the Lake Charles Regional Airport (KLCH).

==Demographics==


As of the 2020 United States census, there were 21,809 people, 8,033 households, and 4,981 families residing in the city.

==Economy==
===Tourism===
Tourist attractions as well as local destinations in Sulphur include:
*Brimstone Museum: A former Southern Pacific Railway depot built in 1915 to facilitate the moving of passengers and freight for the Sulfur mines. The depot was discontinued in the early 1970s and in 1975 was sold to the Sulphur Association of Commerce, on condition that it be moved for safety reasons, and was moved to a location near Frasch Park and renovated. Building restoration was completed and the dedication ceremony took place on the nation&#x27;s 200th birthday, July 4, 1976. The museum highlights includes a permanent exhibit on the history of Sulphur, and is also the only museum in the United States to exhibit historical information on the Frasch mining process. The building was moved a second time, to 900 S. Huntington street, providing more visibility resulting in an increase in visitors, and on December 5, 2005 was transferred to the Brimstone Historical Society. Aside from the permanent exhibits the museum provides exhibits of local interest including art and other historical artifacts from the history of the city.
*Henning Cultural Center: Was built in 1904 and in 2002, was acquired by Sulphur Parks and Recreation, and opened in Heritage Square community area.
*The Creole Nature Trail starts in Sulphur and the Creole Nature Trail Adventure Point provides information on nature and wildlife Areas, hiking trails, outdoor activities, and nature &amp; parks along the route.

==Arts and culture==
In 2014 Sulphur was named the third best city in Louisiana to raise a family.

==Recreation==
Sulphur Parks and Recreation (SPAR) includes Frasch Park and Golf Course, North Frasch Park, the SPAR Water Park, The Grove at Heritage Square, Kyle Park, Pattison Park, McMurry Park, Center Circle Park, and Carlyss Park,

==Education==
Most of Sulphur&#x27;s schools are under the Calcasieu Parish School Board. One high school, Sulphur High School, serves the city, along with the Sulphur High Ninth Grade Campus that was completed in 2004. Elementary schools include Frasch, E.K. Key, W.T. Henning, R.W. Vincent, Maplewood, and Vincent Settlement (Carlyss). D.S. Perkins Elementary, one of the area&#x27;s most challenged schools, closed in 2010, and all students and teachers were transferred to Cypress Cove, a completely new facility located in Carlyss. This represented a move from one of the more impoverished areas of old Sulphur (North Sulphur, a.k.a. &quot;Portie Town&quot; [Portie is pronounced pō-chay]) to one of the wealthier, emerging communities south of town. Middle schools include Leblanc Middle School, the W.W. Lewis Middle School, and Maplewood (K-8th grade). There are some private schools in the area as well, including Our Lady&#x27;s Catholic School on Cypress Street.

Frasch Elementary, W.W. Lewis Middle, and Sulphur High School offer Spanish Immersion classes in which students take Spanish language as well as core classes totally in Spanish from kindergarten all the way to eighth grade, and Spanish language classes up to Spanish V or VI in High School. The program has been praised for giving children a fluency in the Spanish language as well as an understanding of other cultures at an early age. Most of the Immersion teachers come from Hispanic countries or are of Hispanic descent.

<text>Vinton is a town in Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 3,400 in 2020. It is part of the Lake Charles metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
The Old Spanish Trail wandered north and south of what is now U.S. Highway 90, in large part because of the unstable roadbed. The chief means of outside travel in the parish relied on riverboats plying the Sabine and Calcasieu rivers. Much of the marsh and bayous remained impassable. River travel made Lake Charles possible, just as mining for sulfur led to the founding of Sulphur. Settlers had long been in the Vinton area.

Jean Baptise Granger settled acreage between what is now Vinton and Big Woods about 1827, one of the first pioneers of the area. Even so, the area remained sparsely populated.

The area had few settlers because France, New Spain, and Mexico disputed the western boundary of Louisiana for many years. When the United States made the Louisiana Purchase, the disputed area was inherited. Spanish Lt. Col. Simón de Herrera and U.S. General James Wilkinson signed an agreement designating the area as neutral ground, also known as the &quot;Neutral Strip&quot;. The agreement was not a treaty and not ratified by either government, but it was respected by both countries. The area, sometimes referred to as the Rio Hondo Territory, was off limits to the military of both countries, and settlers were not to be allowed, but that did not stop squatters from both countries.

There had been numerous attempts to improve transportation throughout the 19th century. In the 1830s, on the nearby Sabine River, Dr. Robert Neblett developed a bluff into a thriving river port, which became known as Niblett&#x27;s Bluff (&quot;sic&quot;) west of the present-day town. Confederate soldiers in 1863 cut a military road extending from Niblett&#x27;s Bluff on the Sabine River to Alexandria. Although the road never developed into a major artery, during the American Civil War, Niblett&#x27;s Bluff became Fort Niblett, which assisted the Confederate success in the Battle of Mansfield. Fort Niblett continues to be commemorated as part of Niblett&#x27;s Bluff Park.

The parish and Vinton itself might have remained an undeveloped rural backwater without two signal events. The first, which had the greatest material impact on the entire community, was the effort by Charles Morgan&#x27;s railroad companies to construct a railroad from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Orange, Texas — filling a gap that would enable direct rail travel between New Orleans and Houston. The stretch that included Vinton, the Louisiana Western Railroad, opened for traffic on August 30, 1880. The second and most important for Vinton was the arrival of a physician and former professor from Indiana and Iowa, Dr. Seaman A. Knapp. The economy of the town was further diversified and strengthened by the discovery of petroleum at Ged Lake.

===Logging trains===
The coming of the railroad enabled the growth of a logging industry. The part of Louisiana that included Calcasieu Parish was home to the finest longleaf pine in the world. When combined with the stands of cypress and other hardwood lumber, logging was a lucrative prospect. The railroad gave life to Vinton, starting with a switching track. Although there would be a depot later, Vinton began as a whistle stop called Blair. The source of the name is unknown. Some have speculated that the railroad siding took its name from a local family. However, no family named Blair was in residence in the area at that time.

===Agriculture===
Knapp completed the founding of Vinton. Precisely what brought him to Louisiana is unclear, but he certainly had a keen interest in agriculture, especially the improvement of farming methods. Formerly the president of the Iowa Agricultural College in Ames (now Iowa State University, Knapp arrived in Lake Charles in 1884 and went to work running an agricultural business for land developer Jabez B. Watkins. In 1887, he quit his job with Watkins and opened his own land company (some sources claim that Knapp started his company in 1885, but the evidence is inconclusive).

Watkins was a native of Lawrence, Kansas, who came to Lake Charles in 1883. Using English capital, Watkins bought of prairie and marshland in southwest Louisiana. To bring in settlers, he advertised in newspapers across the nation. It is assumed that Knapp was one of the settlers that Watkins attracted to the area. It is also assumed that Knapp was the leading force behind the first settler in what would become the township of Vinton.

Knapp purchased from the US government the tract of land that would form the basis of the town. At the time, he paid $2.50 an acre. On October 17, 1887, Robert F. Evans, also an Iowa native, purchased an additional . The sources are unclear if the acreage was then sold to Knapp or to George Horridge. The records nonetheless show that the Southern Real Estate and Guaranty Company had bought all the land tracts by April 1889. The land was divided into lots and sold at prices ranging between $10 and $25 each. In time, 30 blocks extended the original 12-block plot of land. When the post office was registered with the US Postmaster General, Vinton, Knapp&#x27;s Iowa hometown, was chosen as the name of the settlement, but when the Postmaster designated the name, he left no explanation for his choice so there is some doubt about the origin of the name. In a 2013 article on the town, the &quot;Advocate&quot; asserted that Knapp indeed named Vinton, Louisiana, &quot;after his hometown of Vinton, Iowa.&quot;

It is possible that Knapp was responsible for the large influx of settlers from Vinton, Iowa. The Horridge, Stevenson, Eddie, Ferguson, Stockwell, Morgan, Nelson, Fairchild, Banker, Hall, and Haskill families were Iowa transplants. Some streets still bear the name of those families. Shortly after construction of the first homes came a sawmill, the Methodist Church, and the first public school building. In 1890, Mrs. Mabel K. Kelly became the first teacher in Vinton. A larger school replaced the older structure in 1901.

===Petroleum===
Between the initial founding of the settlement and its incorporation is an extraordinary event. The winter of 1895 brought a surprise. On February 14–15, the edge of the worst blizzard in American history touched southwestern Louisiana. A record of snow fell on Lake Charles. Some areas reported snowfall between . In Vinton, the blizzard crippled the new sheep industry, and the farmers salvaged what they could by shaving wool from the dead flocks.

Despite the setback caused by the storm, the town grew steadily, aided by the oil boom following the discovery of petroleum reserves at Ged Lake, about south of Vinton, along Ged Road.

==Geography==
Vinton is located in western Calcasieu Parish at (30.190093, -93.580587). U.S. Route 90 passes through the center of town, and Interstate 10 runs along the southern edge, with access from exits 7 and 8. Sulphur, Louisiana, is to the east, and Orange, Texas, is the same distance to the west.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Vinton has a total area of , of which is land and , or 1.01%, is water.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 3,400 people, 1,152 households, and 829 families residing in the town.

<text>Cameron is a census-designated place (CDP) in and the parish seat of Cameron Parish, Louisiana, United States. It is part of the Lake Charles Metropolitan Statistical Area. After sustaining extreme damage from Hurricane Rita in 2005 and Hurricane Ike in 2008, in the 2010 Census Cameron was recorded as having a population of only 406, a 79% drop since 2000.

== History ==

The town of Cameron was originally called Leesburg, although the post office was designated Cameron, like the parish. Its location at the mouth of the Calcasieu River made it a transhipment location for mail, cattle, and other goods to be taken by ship to Lake Charles. After the sinking of the first successful oil well in Louisiana in 1901, Cameron became a center of petroleum extraction.

In 1957, Cameron was nearly destroyed by Hurricane Audrey. A storm surge of and winds of devastated nearby oilfields and caused the deaths of more than 300 residents of the town.

Nearly fifty years later, in late September 2005, Hurricane Rita hit Cameron with winds and the highest storm surges ever recorded in the state, at Cameron and possibly in some locations. Much of the town was destroyed, but everyone had evacuated beforehand.

On September 13, 2008, Hurricane Ike leveled Cameron with a storm surge while the town was still recovering from Rita in 2005. Ike destroyed more than 90 percent of the homes in the parish seat and caused catastrophic flooding in every part of the parish.

After Rita and Ike, the parish instituted stricter building codes, and insurance rates rose dramatically, making rebuilding too expensive for many residents. The population of Cameron fell 79 percent between 2000 and 2010. By 2010, when the First Baptist Church was rebuilt, the town had lost its grocery stores and drug store and had only a gas station and a bank, and the post office and a restaurant, both housed in trailers. Most residents were still living in mobile homes. The main parish library, destroyed by Rita and again by Ike, was rebuilt on tall stilts; South Cameron Memorial Hospital, destroyed by Rita, was also rebuilt to withstand tropical storms. A new government complex was completed in 2015 but repairs to the parish courthouse were still needed.

On August 27, 2020, at 1:00 am CDT, Hurricane Laura made landfall near Cameron with maximum sustained winds of , a category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale. A storm surge measured between 9 and 12 feet inundated the immediate areas surrounding Cameron according to Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards. Much of the town was again destroyed or severely damaged, including the hospital.

Six weeks later, Hurricane Delta made landfall not too far east of Cameron as a category 2 storm. It caused further damage following Laura. Clean up from Laura was paused in preparation for Delta.

Prior to Hurricane Rita&#x27;s impact in September 2005, Cameron Elementary School served pre-kindergarten through 7th grade students, while high schoolers attended Johnson Bayou High School. Hurricane Rita damaged both schools and also South Cameron High School, a K–12 school in Creole. Students from both high schools shared Grand Lake High School&#x27;s campus with Grand Lake for nearly a year. In fall 2006, using portable buildings, high school students returned to the Johnson Bayou campus while Cameron Elementary, South Cameron Elementary, and South Cameron High School students were consolidated on the South Cameron High School campus.

Hurricane Ike in 2008 caused varying degrees of damage to every school and library in Cameron Parish. Most were flooded by storm surge and sustained wind damage, and as a result, all schools were closed. Four new schools were built over the following seven years, the last being a new Johnson Bayou High School near Cameron.

The Cameron Parish Public Library operated the main Cameron Parish Library in Cameron. negative effects from a hurricane mean the library is not open. The current building opened after a previous one was razed by Hurricane Ike, with yet another one razed by Hurricane Rita before it. In 2020 Rick Rojas of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the current library as &quot;like a fortress on stilts&quot;. For a period beginning on April 1, 2010, the ex-Wendell Electric and Hardware Store served as the library.

Cameron Parish is in the service area of Sowela Technical Community College.

<text>Harrisonburg is a village in and the parish seat of Catahoula Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 348 as of the 2010 census, down from 746 in 2000.

Riley J. Wilson, who held Louisiana&#x27;s 5th congressional district seat from 1915 to 1937, resided in Harrisonburg, where he was principal of Harrisonburg High School and then an attorney, district attorney, and state district court judge prior to his election to Congress.

== History ==
Harrisonburg was named for the Harrison family of Virginia.

Fort Beauregard, located on a bluff in the northern corner of the village, was a Confederate stronghold during the American Civil War. In 1863, the fort successfully defended Harrisonburg from the attack of four Union gunboats coming from the Black River to the Ouachita River. After four days of bombardment, little damage was done, and the gunboats retired down river. Harrisonburg and fort were evacuated before Brig. General Crocker&#x27;s considerable naval and army forces arrived on September 4, 1863. The Confederates lost eight significant artillery pieces although two large 32 pound cannons were preserved. On March 1 through the 4, 1864 the town was again attacked by Union gunboats, but the falling river level prevented the advance on Monroe.

The village of Harrisonburg formerly staged reenactments at Fort Beauregard, also known as Fort Hill, but those ceremonies ended in the late 20th century. These reenactments were brought back to life for 2015, but halted in 2016, still planned for future years to come.

Harrisonburg was once a trade capital because of its location on the Ouachita River, with easy access to the Mississippi River and New Orleans. The Harrisonburg Road ran through the area as it crossed Louisiana between Mississippi&#x27;s Natchez Trace and Texas&#x27; El Camino Real.

Harrisonburg was considered for the new site of the Louisiana state capital when the legislature decided to move it from New Orleans after the Civil War.

<text>Sicily Island is a village in Catahoula Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 336 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Sicily Island is located in northeastern Catahoula Parish at (31.846573, -91.658925). U.S. Route 425 passes through the village, leading north to Winnsboro and southeast to Natchez, Mississippi. Louisiana State Highway 8 leads southwest to Harrisonburg, the Catahoula Parish seat.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Sicily Island has a total area of , all land. Despite its name, Sicily Island is not an island; instead, nearby lakes and rivers gave the area a shape early settlers considered reminiscent of the island of Sicily.

==History==
In the early 1700s, the area that would become Sicily Island was the site of a Natchez settlement. In January 1731, towards the end of the Natchez Revolt, French forces besieged the Natchez fort, compelling the surrender of 45 men and 450 women and children. Although the bulk of the Natchez leaders and warriors escaped, the siege marked the last major engagement of the war.

In 1881, a Jewish agricultural colony was created in Sicily Island with the support of the Am Olam organization and the Hebrew Emigrant Aid Society. The colony was mostly made up of immigrants from Yelisavetgrad who were fleeing the pogroms that began that same year. By 1882, the colony was completely disbanded as the Mississippi River flooded, destroying most farms.
