<doc id="120095" wikidata="Q862727" url="?curid=120095" title="Red Wing, Minnesota">
<text>Red Wing is a city and the county seat of Goodhue County, Minnesota, United States, along the upper Mississippi River. The population was 16,547 at the 2020 census.

This city is named for early 19th-century Dakota Sioux chief Red Wing. The federal government established a Mdewakanton Sioux Indian reservation—now Prairie Island Indian Community—in 1889 along the Mississippi River to free up land for new settlers. The city of Red Wing developed around it.

The National Trust for Historic Preservation placed Red Wing on its 2008 distinctive destinations list because of its &quot;impressive architecture and enviable natural environment.&quot;

==History==
In the early 1850s, settlers from Mississippi River steamboats came to Red Wing to farm in Goodhue County. They encroached on traditional territory of the Mdewakanton Sioux.

The settlers cleared the land for wheat, the annual crop of which could pay the cost of the land. Before railroads were constructed across the territory of Goodhue County, it produced more wheat than any other county in the country. In 1873, Red Wing led the country in wheat sold by farmers. The warehouses in the port of Red Wing could store and export more than a million bushels.

Once the railroads connected southern Minnesota with Minneapolis and Saint Anthony, where the largest flour mills were built, the port at Red Wing lost prominence.

The Aurora Ski Club in Red Wing, founded on February 8, 1887, was one of the first ski clubs in North America, reflecting the skills of Scandinavian immigrants in the area. In the 1880s, Aurora club members introduced what became known as &quot;Red Wing Style&quot; ski techniques, patterned after the Telemark skiing form. The term &quot;Red Wing style&quot; remained in use in the U.S. well into the 20th century. In 1887, Norwegian immigrant Mikkjel Hemmestveit set the first North American ski jumping record, 37 feet, at the Aurora Ski Club&#x27;s McSorley Hill.

In 1889, the federal government established a Mdewakanton Sioux Indian reservation along the Mississippi River to free up land for settlers. It is now within the city of Red Wing, and is known as the Prairie Island Indian Community.

Red Wing&#x27;s first settlers built small mills, factories, and workshops like those they were familiar with in New England and the upper Midwest, whence many had come. Numerous immigrants from Germany, Ireland, Norway and Sweden settled in this area and were also skilled craftsmen. Some early industries were tanning and shoe-making, while other businesses manufactured farm equipment, bricks, barrels, boats, furniture, pottery, and clothing buttons. Consumables included beer and lumber. Service industries including stone-cutting, hospitality, and retailing. The St. James Hotel remains a working token of the earlier time.

Red Wing was once home to Hamline University, founded in 1854 as Minnesota&#x27;s first institution of higher education. It closed in 1869 because of low enrollment due to diversion of students to the American Civil War. Chartered in St. Paul in 1871, it reopened there in 1880.

Red Wing Seminary was a Lutheran Church seminary, founded in 1879. It was the educational center for Hauge&#x27;s Norwegian Evangelical Lutheran Synod in America, commonly known as the Hauge Synod. Red Wing Seminary operated until 1917.

Red Wing also was the home of Minnesota Elementarskola, a Swedish elementary school that was the predecessor to Gustavus Adolphus College, a private liberal arts college of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America (ELCA). The school was founded in Red Wing in 1862 by Eric Norelius, moved to East Union in 1863, and then was built in St. Peter in 1873–76.

The Red Wing Pottery and stoneware industry began in 1861, when county potter John Paul discovered the large, glacially deposited clay pit beds in the northwest of the city, close to Hay Creek. The first commercial pottery company, Red Wing Stoneware, was founded in 1877. It used clay from the area of the Hay Creek headwaters, close to Goodhue, near a hamlet named Claybank. A railroad branch line was built to carry clay to Red Wing for this industry. The factory buildings remain, but only traces of the railroad, abandoned in 1937, are left.

===20th century to present===

The Minnesota Correctional Facility – Red Wing is housed in the former Minnesota State Training School, built in 1889. Warren B. Dunnell designed the original Romanesque building. He was the architect of a number of Minnesota&#x27;s public buildings. The institution was the subject of &quot;Walls of Red Wing&quot;, a folk song by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan.

In the last half of the 20th century, the United States Army Corps of Engineers built Lock and Dam No. 3 and deepened the channel on the Mississippi River to improve navigation in this area. Such projects have revitalized Mississippi River traffic for shipping grain and coal. The port of Red Wing has gained business as a result.

In 1973, the Prairie Island Nuclear Power Plant opened along the river. The federal government authorized the project in consultation with the Minnesota state government. Xcel Energy owns and operates the facility.

<text>Vasa Township is a township in Goodhue County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 872 at the 2000 census. Part of the township is part of the Vasa Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places.

Vasa Township was organized in 1858 and named for Gustav I of Sweden (Gustav Vasa). The township has been referred to by multiple names in the past, including Mattson(&#x27;s) Settlement, Vasa, and Vasa Village.

== History ==
In 1853 Hans Mattson was the first European to settle the area. He later encouraged many Swedish families to join him. The group of families was known as the Mattson Settlement. The settlement was later renamed Vasa (variously referred to as Vasa Village), for the local Swedish church who had chosen the name of the king of Sweden during the Reformation.

The United States government and the Upper Dakota Sioux entered into the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux in 1851, which made a large swathe of what is today western and southern Minnesota US land, including the growing site of Vasa. While there had already been rapid growth in European settlement of the area largely against Dakota wishes, as US leaders pushed the Westward Expansion, the 1851 treaty further encouraged the wave. Between 1854 and 1880, Vasa grew beyond the original 10 families and the greater Goodhue County recorded more than 4,300 residents. During the 1800s, 19 buildings were built in the village center.

Vasa prospered agriculturally and was notable for hosting a US post office on the original Minnesota Rural Free Delivery route until the 1950s when core businesses closed and growth became stagnant. Today the site of the original village, including the church and orphanage, is on the National Register of Historical Places as the Vasa Historical District. It is the best preserved early Swedish settlement in Minnesota with architecture representative of the era, from which Swedish-descent Americans in Minnesota continue to draw cultural imagery.

=== Historic district ===
A portion of the community is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Vasa Historic District. Vasa was established in 1853 by Swedish immigrant farmers. While its population declined significantly in the twentieth century, the architecture and landscape of the district is well-preserved and its National Register nomination described it as &quot;the most intact... of the original Swedish colonies in Minnesota&quot;. The Old Vasa Swedish Lutheran Church, which was built in 1861, is now a museum of local Swedish history. Vasa Children&#x27;s Home was originally located in the church and later had its own building nearby.

==The &quot;Elbow Lake&quot; Runestone==

In August 1949, the nearest local newspaper to Barrett, the &quot;Elbow Lake Herald&quot;, reported that, five years earlier, farmer Victor Setterlund had found on his land, near Barrett Lake, a heart-shaped stone weighing about , bearing a runic inscription. Translated, the runic message was &quot;[Year ????]. Four maidens camped on this hill.&quot; Hjalmar Holand, principal promoter of the Kensington Runestone (not far to the south-east of Barrett in 1898) interpreted the year symbols as 1362, the same as the Kensington stone. Debunker Johan Holvik thought they should be read as 1776. The two experts agreed that the stone seemed to be a hoax. When Holvik revisited the area and asked Setterlund what the year symbols were meant to represent, the farmer confessed that he had carved the stone himself, using a list of runes in a textbook, and intended the date 1876, adding &quot;It sure doesn&#x27;t take much to put some people on if they want to believe you bad enough.&quot;

<text>Aalsmeer () is a municipality and a town in the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland. Its name is derived from the Dutch for eel (&quot;aal&quot;) and lake (&quot;meer&quot;). Aalsmeer is bordered by the Westeinderplassen lake, the largest open water of the Randstad, and the Ringvaart Canal. The town is located 13 km (8 mi) southwest of Amsterdam.

The town is sometimes referred to as the flower capital of the world, as the largest flower auction in the world is based in Aalsmeer, along with numerous nurseries and an experimental station for floriculture.

==Population centres==
The municipality of Aalsmeer consists of the following cities, towns, and villages: Aalsmeer, Kudelstaart, Oosteinde, as well as the hamlet Calslagen.

==Geology==
Aalsmeer is located on the border of the former Haarlem Lake. The older portion of the town is built on peat, and is surrounded by polders. The polders consist of loamy soil and are below sea level.

==History==

Aalsmeer is first referenced in a document from 1133 in which it is called &quot;Alsmar&quot; and is granted to the Abbey of Rijnsburg. Diederik VII van Kleef confirmed this grant in an act in 1199. The area was then a wilderness with alders and willow forests.

In its surroundings, large tracts of land were dug up for peat, creating large lakes and ponds such as Oosteinderpoel (East End Pool), Schinkelpoel (Schinkel Pool), Stommeer (Stom Lake), Hornmeer (Horn Lake), Legmeer (Leg Lake), and the Westeinderplassen (West End Ponds). This left little land for agriculture, causing Aalsmeer&#x27;s inhabitants to switch to fishery. The land was cultivated intensely, mostly for tree nurseries.
The lack of dry land was countered by reclaiming some of the lakes, starting with Stom Lake in 1650, and followed by Horn Lake in 1674. In 1852, the large Haarlem Lake, bordering on Aalsmeer, was made into a polder. Then followed Schinkelpoel, Oosteinderpoel, and Legmeer. Peat was no longer dug up and the fishing business declined. Yet horticulture increased, especially strawberry cultivation, which peaked between 1850 and 1885. The strawberry became the symbol for the flag of Aalsmeer: red (fruit), green (leaf), and black (soil). The cultivation of flowers began circa 1880, first with roses in greenhouses.

The growers would sell their strawberries and flowers to distributors who would bring them with barges to the market in Amsterdam. But the trade shifted to Aalsmeer where auctions began to be held in local cafés. In 1912 two auction businesses were established: &quot;Centrale Aalsmeerse Veiling&quot; (Central Aalsmeer Auction) in the town&#x27;s centre and &quot;Bloemenlust&quot; in Aalsmeer East.

===World War II===
During World War 2, Aalsmeer gained a reputation for its Nazi support, mostly because of its fanatical National Socialistic mayor and a handful of fascist supporters. The highest supreme commander of the German Wehrmacht in the Netherlands, Friedrich Christiansen, was a regular visitor. Following the war, more than a hundred court cases were held against Nazi supporters from Aalsmeer.

===Post war===
In 1950 Aalsmeer had 12,500 inhabitants. In 1968 the two flower auction businesses merged, and in 1972 a new large auction building was completed in South Aalsmeer and expanded in 1999.

==Local government==
The municipal council of Aalsmeer consists of 23 seats, which since 2022 are divided as follows:
* Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) – 6 seats
* Absoluut Aalsmeer (AA) – 6 seats
* People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) – 5 seats
* Democrats 66 (D66) – 3 seats
* GreenLeft (GL) – 2 seats
* Labour Party (PvdA) – 1 seat

The executive board consists of CDA, VVD and D66, with Gido Oude Kotte (CDA) as mayor.

==Public transport==

* N57 - Amsterdam Centraal - Amsterdam City Centre - Amstelveen - Bovenkerk - &quot;Aalsmeer&quot; (Nightbus)

All of these services are very frequent, half-hourly or more frequent.

==Economy==
Having of floor space, the flower auction building of is one of the largest commercial buildings in the world. Its close proximity to Schiphol Airport allows the growers access to markets worldwide. On 1 January 2008 the Aalsmeer flower auction merged with the united auctions of Naaldwijk and Rijnsburg under the name FloraHolland, and is the largest auction market in the world. The flowers that are grown and sold here are carnations, roses, lilacs, freesias, chrysanthemums, cyclamens, and begonias.

The Endemol television studios are located in the former Central Auction building. The Bloemenlust building is nowadays a sports, event, and congress centre. Dominating the Ringvaart canal are the large building halls of Royal De Vries Scheepsbouw.

Agriculture and manufacturing also play an important role in the economy of the locality. Dairy, beef, potatoes, vegetables, and fruit are the areas within agriculture, and the types of manufacturing in the city are farm products, sporting goods, boats, and packaging material.

==Culture==

<text>Amstelveen () is a municipality and city in the province of North Holland, Netherlands, with a population of 95,996 as of 2024. It is a suburban part of the Amsterdam metropolitan area.

The municipality of Amstelveen consists of the historical villages of Bovenkerk and Nes aan de Amstel. In addition, as well as Downtown Amstelveen (Dutch: &quot;Amstelveen stadshart&quot;), it contains the following neighbourhoods: Westwijk, Bankras-Kostverloren, Groenelaan, Waardhuizen, Middenhoven, Randwijk, Elsrijk and Keizer Karelpark. The name comes from the Amstel, a local river (as does the name Amsterdam) and , meaning fen, peat, or moor. Amstelveen houses the international headquarters of Dutch national airline KLM (although it is slated to leave for Schiphol in 2024) and KPMG, one of the Big Four accounting firms. The Cobra Museum is also located in Amstelveen.

==History==
During the French occupation between 1810 and 1814, Amstelveen was the capital of a canton in the French department Zuyderzée, and until 1964 the municipality of Amstelveen was called Nieuwer-Amstel. It is technically a large &quot;dorp&quot; (village), because it was never walled. The Amstelveen flag and coat of arms, both present 5 strips in a red, black, red, black, red pattern, with three crosses on the top black strip, and a single cross in the middle of the lower black strip. The symbols bear great similarity to that of Amsterdam&#x27;s, though the exact nature of the relationship remains unclear. The Thijssepark (in full the Dr Jac. P. Thijssepark), was the first &quot;heempark&quot; in the Netherlands, and is one of sixteen &quot;heemparks&quot; or &quot;heemgroen&quot; in Amstelveen. Designed by landscape architect C. P. Broerse, following the ideas of the great Dutch naturalist and conservationist Jac. P. Thijsse, it was developed between 1940 and 1972 and covers an area of 5 hectares (about 12 acres), and is situated just south of the Amsterdamse Bos. Amstelveen was chosen as an unlikely host of a match in the 1999 Cricket World Cup, for which the Netherlands had not qualified. South Africa played Kenya in the match. Former Dutch prime minister Jan Peter Balkenende started his political career as member of the council for Amstelveen. As a result of the vicinity of Schiphol (Amsterdam Airport), and its links to Amsterdam, Amstelveen has grown and become a cosmopolitan mix of many cultures.

In the early 20th century Amstelveen was a small rural village. The turf industry had collapsed, so the village had lost its revenues from it. The village was somewhat isolated, because it had no major railway or waterway. The main source of income was livestock farming, with some arable, but horticulture and floriculture were already emerging.

In 1852 the Haarlemmermeer polder was reclaimed and the &quot;Fort at the Schiphol&quot; was created as a defense for Amsterdam. Forts were in those days more often named after rivers. &quot;Fort at the Schiphol&quot; was a ditch separating Aalsmeer and Amstelveen, and named after a piece of land from Amstelveen. Fort Schiphol became a military airport in 1916. Four years later Schiphol became a civilian airport. Schiphol Fort was demolished in 1934 to build a provincial road (Mayor Van Sonweg) from Amstelveen to Schiphol, with a swing bridge over the circular canal of the Haarlemmermeer. The development of Schiphol Airport attracted many people, many of whom settled in Amstelveen. The headquarters of KLM was established there. Amstelveen once was the fastest growing city in the Netherlands and has now grown to 91,691 inhabitants (2020).

After World War II Amstelveen caught a portion of Amsterdam&#x27;s housing shortage, and was also a member of the municipality of Schiphol. Amsterdam&#x27;s plan was to introduce Amstelveen as a metropolitan area, with its urban and green areas. Amstelveen remained an independent and self-conscious municipality and adopted a policy that reflected many attractive new residential areas. Amstelveen&#x27;s landscaping and added art attracted much international attention.

In 1993, Amstelveen was in the news for its Krokettenmotie, debated in the municipal council after a motion proposal by Jan Peter Balkenende. In 2004 Amstelveen was voted the most attractive city in the Netherlands in which to live. Currently Amstelveen is in the top three on the national list of best cities to live in. The Amstelveen city centre also received the number one award for the Netherlands&#x27; best shopping centre in 2013, 2014 and 2015.

In 2018 the St. Urbanus Church (&quot;Sint-Urbanuskerk&quot;) in Bovenkerk caught fire. The tower remained standing but the rest of the church suffered severe damage.

The city&#x27;s close proximity to Schiphol Airport makes it a prime location for people working in the aviation industry.

==Economy==

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines as well as the commercial organisation for the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg have their head offices in Amstelveen (), although it is slated to leave in 2024. Air France-KLM is represented by the KLM head office.

In addition, Amstelveen houses the international headquarters of Big Four accounting firm KPMG. Large international corporations such as Canon Inc. and Hewlett-Packard also have corporate offices in Amstelveen.

==Transport==

Amstelveen is served by two tram lines running south from Amsterdam Zuid station. Tram line 5 runs south via Amsterdam Zuid to Stadshart (city centre) in Amstelveen. Tram line 25 runs between Amsterdam Zuid station and Westwijk. Both tram lines serve stops between Amsterdam Zuid and Oranjebaan. Tram line 25 replaced a portion of Metro line 51 that used to run between Amsterdam Zuid station and Westwijk.

Amstelveen has a point-to-point bus connection to other villages and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol as well as a local network. There is also an extensive bus system.

<text>Beemster () is a former municipality in the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland. The Beemster is the first polder in the Netherlands reclaimed from a lake, the water extracted by windmills between 1609 and 1612. The original well-ordered landscape of fields, roads, canals, and dykes has been preserved intact. A grid of canals parallels the grid of roads in the Beemster. The larger feeder canals are offset by approximately one kilometer from the larger roads.

Beemster merged into the existing municipality of Purmerend on 1 January 2022. 

== Population centres == 
The former municipality of Beemster contained the following small towns and villages: 

== History ==
Around 800 AD the area of the modern municipality of Beemster was covered in peat. The name &quot;Beemster&quot; was derived from &quot;Bamestra&quot;, the name of a small river in the area. In the period 1150–1250 peat-digging and storm floods enlarged that small river into an inland sea, a lake connected with the Zuiderzee. Around 1605 private investors started to drain the Beemster lake. In 1610, this was almost complete, but the lake re-filled because of a breach in the Zuiderzee dikes. It was decided to make the ring-dike a meter high above the surrounding country. In 1612 the polder was dry and the land was divided among the investors. In the earlier days of the polder, farmers occupied its lands for growing the crops necessary for long sea journeys by the VOC to the East Indies. The farmland was so good that the project was considered an economic success, in contrast to, e.g., the Heerhugowaard. Since 1999 the entire Beemster polder has been on the UNESCO world heritage list.

The Beemster polder is home to CONO Kaasmakers, maker of the Beemster brand of cheeses. This co-op was formed in 1901 to create cheese made from milk that comes from the Beemster polder. Today Beemster Cheese is sold in Europe, as well as the U.S., Canada, Japan, and China.

==World Heritage Site==
Because of its historical relevance, and as the original structure of the area is still largely intact, the Beemster was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Site list in 1999. Justification for inclusion is as follows:
* (i): The Beemster Polder is a masterpiece of creative planning, in which the ideals of antiquity and the Renaissance were applied to the design of a reclaimed landscape.
* (ii): The innovative and intellectually imaginative landscape of the Beemster Polder had a profound and lasting impact on reclamation projects in Europe and beyond.
* (iv): The creation of the Beemster Polder marks a major step forward in the interrelationship between humankind and water at a crucial period of social and economic expansion.

In addition, in the Beemster Polder, there are five fortresses as part of the Stelling van Amsterdam, another UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Beemster Polder combines two UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

== Local government ==
The municipal council of Beemster consisted of 13 seats which at the last elections in 2018 divided as follows:

The last mayor was Joyce van Beek (CDA).

Elections were held in November 2021 for a council for the new merged municipality of Purmerend, that included Beemster, which commenced work in January 2022.

== Notable people ==

* Carel Fabritius (1622 in Middenbeemster – 1654) a Dutch painter
* Barent Fabritius (1624 in Middenbeemster - 1673) a Dutch painter 
* Johannes Fabritius (1636 – ca.1693) a Dutch Golden Age painter
* The Reverend Nanne Zwiep (1894 in Beemster – 1942 in Dachau) a pastor of the Dutch Reformed Church
* Harry Droog (born 1944) a retired Dutch rower, competed at the 1968 Summer Olympics

<text>Bennebroek () is a village and former municipality in the northwest Netherlands, now part of Bloemendaal, North Holland. Before its merger in 2009, it was the smallest municipality in the Netherlands, covering an area of only 1.75 km².

==History==
Bennebroek was probably formed in the 13th century and its development was closely linked to the peat harvesting industry.

On 28 May 1653, Bennebroek split off from the Heemstede fiefdom and Adriaen Pauw, son of Adriaan Pauw, became its first feudal lord. Its population was dependent on animal husbandry and transportation. Later bulb flower cultivation became an important business. Since the second half of the 20th century, Bennebroek has primarily been a commuter community for the surrounding cities.

On 29 March 2007, the municipal councils of Bennebroek and Bloemendaal agreed to merge into one municipality, which took place on 1 January 2009.

=== Local government ===
The last municipal council of Bennebroek before its merger consisted of 11 seats, which at the 2006 elections were divided as follows:
* VVD - 4 seats
* CDA - 4 seats
* PvdA - 3 seats

==Attractions==
*Linnaeushof - a park known as Europe&#x27;s largest children&#x27;s playground, formerly a botanical garden where Carl Linnaeus acted as &quot;hortulanus&quot; (lead gardener) in the 18th century and where he wrote the &quot;Hortus Cliffortianus&quot;

<doc id="120125" wikidata="Q9905" url="?curid=120125" title="Beverwijk">
<text>Beverwijk () is a municipality and a city in the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland. The town is located about northwest of Amsterdam in the Randstad metropolitan area, north of the North Sea Canal very close to the North Sea coast. A railway tunnel and two motorway tunnels cross the canal between Beverwijk and the nearby city of Haarlem on the south side of the canal. 

Around 1640, a town called Beverwyck was founded in the Dutch colony of New Netherland. That town&#x27;s modern name is Albany, New York.

== Population centres ==
The municipality of Beverwijk consists of two cores, Beverwijk proper and Wijk aan Zee, to the west, right on the coast.

==History==
The name Beverwijk comes from &quot;Bedevaartswijk&quot;, meaning &quot;pilgrimage neighbourhood&quot;. The town formed at the Saint Agatha Church which was a pilgrimage location in the Middle Ages. Allegedly Agatha of Sicily appeared there in the 9th century to a virgin from Velsen who was fleeing from the Count of Kennemerland.

In 1276, Beverwijk was granted market rights by Floris V, and in 1298 it was granted city rights by John I, both Counts of Holland.

During the 17th century, wealthy merchants from Amsterdam built their estates, such as &quot;Huize Akerendam&quot;, &quot;Huize Westerhout&quot;, and &quot;Huize Scheijbeeck&quot;, in the scenic dunes surrounding Beverwijk. Or they changed former strongholds in country retreats like Adrichem Castle.

Prior to the reclamation of the IJ Bay, the narrowest point in the North Holland peninsula was at Beverwijk. Therefore, a defensive line was built there in 1800 following the Battle of Castricum in 1799.

In 1944, during the Second World War, the Germans conducted a house-to-house raid in Beverwijk and Velsen-Noord, seizing nearly 500 persons as hostages to force the murderers of three collaborators to surrender themselves. In all, 63 of them never returned.

Around 1977, the first furniture stores opened along the Parallel Road, forming the first &quot;furniture boulevard&quot; in the Netherlands. By 1981, 10 businesses had been established there. South of the furniture boulevard, the Bazaar was introduced in 1980.

On March 23, 1997, Beverwijk was the location of a clash of two football firms. Supporters of the Dutch football team AFC Ajax met with Feyenoord supporters in what has come to be known as the &quot;Battle of Beverwijk&quot;. During this incident, one Ajax supporter was beaten to death.

Since 1997, Special Needs Judo Foundation has organised its annual OBG (Open Beverwijk G-judo) tournament in Sporthal De Walvis, featuring over 1000 special needs judoka from all over the world. The tournament takes place every year in April.

<text>Bussum () is a commuter town and former municipality in the Gooi region in the south east of the province of North Holland in the Netherlands near Hilversum. Since 2016, Bussum has been part of the new municipality of Gooise Meren. 

Bussum had a population of 33,595 in 2019 and covered an area of .

==History==
For a long time Bussum was a hamlet situated in the heathlands of the Gooi and was first mentioned in 1306. At this time, Bussum was shown on maps as a large heathland with many small farms, sheep pens and forests. Since Bussum was situated near the fortified town of Naarden it was governed by Naarden from 1369. In 1470 Bussum had about 250 inhabitants, which made it the smallest village in the Gooi. 

Bussum became independent from Naarden in 1817, yet it was not until the arrival of a railway line in 1874 that Bussum began to flourish. Two train stations were built in the town, that still exist today: Naarden-Bussum and Bussum Zuid (Dutch for Bussum South), both on the connection between Amsterdam and Hilversum. The stations and the road network fostered the town&#x27;s status as a satellite town of Amsterdam, allowing for reverse commute also to Hilversum. From 1898 until 1907, Bussum housed the first Dutch socialist colony after the example of Thoreau&#x27;s Walden, set up by the writer and psychiatrist Frederik van Eeden. In 1951, Bussum hosted the first Dutch national TV broadcast and the national TV studios were located there until 1964. 

Bussum merged with the local municipalities of Naarden, Muiden and Muiderberg on 1 January 2016. In October 2014, the combined town councils chose the name Gooise Meren for the new municipality, the other options being Naarden-Bussum and Naardingerland.

== Local government ==
The last municipal council of Bussum consisted of 23 seats, which at the 2014 election were divided as follows:

* PvdA - 3 seats
* CDA - 2 seats
* GroenLinks - 2 seats

<doc id="120135" wikidata="Q1844520" url="?curid=120135" title="Norcross, Minnesota">
<text>Norcross is a city in Grant County, Minnesota, United States, along the Mustinka River. The population was 52 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Norcross was platted in 1881. In 1882, Norcross began as a large grain ranch owned by N.F. Griswold and Captain J.N. Cross. They convinced the Great Northern Railway to build the depot at their ranch rather than two miles north at the planned town of Gorton. The train regularly stopped at the ranch to pick up wheat, and the railroad officials agreed to build the depot and grain elevators there. Why the name Norcross instead of Griscross? The two gentlemen and an old army career man, called Norton, donated the land for the town. Norton and Cross teamed up for the city name, Norcross, and Griswold settled for main street, known as &quot;Griswold Ave.&quot; The city&#x27;s name is an amalgamation of Henry Allyn Norton and Judson Newell Cross, the founders.

The town incorporated in 1913 with 140 people. Lund and Sellseth started a bank in 1909, which closed in 1931, a victim of the Depression. The first school, named &quot;New School,&quot; opened in 1903, and later was home to the Norwegian Lutheran Church when a newer school was built. In 1928, a great fire destroyed all the buildings on the south side of town. Refusing to give in to the forces of nature, the citizens opened a creamery, the town hall, and a liquor store, which later was converted to a pool hall during Prohibition. George Houps for Iowa bought the stockyards and started a general store.

At one time Norcross had three churches. Our Savior&#x27;s Lutheran Church celebrated their 75th anniversary in 1976 and their 90th anniversary in 1991, and is now a beautiful private home. Before the church was built, early pioneers walked 17 miles to a church northeast of Norcross in order to be confirmed. St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church opened in 1905 and closed in 1923. The Faith United Methodist Church began services in the Amundson School in 1919, erected a church in 1952, and closed in 2007.

American Legion Hillestad-Borgeson Post #410, based in Norcross, established a veterans&#x27; memorial in Norcross Park on Highway 9. The monument erected by the post is dedicated &quot;In memory of all the men and women who have served their country in all wars.&quot; A National Guardsman and 2005 veteran of the war in Iraq, Norcross native Jacob Veldhouse&#x27;s name is inscribed there, as is the name of his uncle, Dennis.

The Norcross Town Hall, built in the late &#x27;20s, was the place to be when growing up in Norcross. People danced, roller skated, attended funerals and wedding receptions, hosted church fundraiser dinners, and even basketball games. The brick building fell into disrepair and was dismantled in 1997. Bricks were offered free to the public.

A post office started operation at Norcross since 1881. The United States Postal Service suspended the post office to be relocated to the post office in Herman in October 2019.

The Norcross school building is a worthy candidate for the National Register of Historic Places. Built in 1938 by the WPA, the building is made entirely of poured concrete, a fine example of Art Deco architecture. For over thirty years, students from first through seventh grade were educated in the three-room school. The school consolidated with Herman in 1971, and now the building is privately owned.

<text>Enkhuizen () is a municipality and a city in the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland and the region of West-Frisia. 

== History ==

Enkhuizen, like Hoorn and Amsterdam, was one of the harbour-towns of the VOC, from where overseas trade with the East Indies was conducted. It received city rights in 1355. On June 24, 1572 during the Eighty Years&#x27; War, in Enkhuizen five Franciscans from Alkmaar were hanged: known as the martyrs of Alkmaar.

In the mid-17th century, Enkhuizen was at the peak of its power and was one of the most important harbour cities in the Netherlands. However, due to a variety of reasons, notably the silting up of the harbours, Enkhuizen lost its position to Amsterdam.

== Tourism ==
Enkhuizen has one of the largest marinas in the Netherlands. The Zuiderzee Museum is located in Enkhuizen. The Drommedaris is the oldest building in Enkhuizen, dating from 1540. Tourists can take boat trips to and from the port to Medemblik.

== Industry ==
Industrially, Enkhuizen is home to a number of seed production companies, Enza Zaden, Syngenta, Bayer Crop Science, as well as a plastics factory. Tourism is also a large part of the economy.

==Population centres ==
The municipality of Enkhuizen consists of the city of Enkhuizen and the settlements of Oosterdijk and Westeinde.

== Local government ==
After the 2022 local election, the 17 seats of Enkhuizen municipal council divided as follows:
== Transport ==
Enkhuizen station offers direct rail service to Hoorn, Amsterdam and Maastricht/Heerlen, with the journey to Amsterdam Centraal of around an hour.

During the summer, ferries for pedestrians and cyclists operate between Enkhuizen and Stavoren, Medemblik and Urk.

It is also possible to drive or cycle across the Houtribdijk to Lelystad, passing under a naviduct near the Krabbersgat lock.

<text>Haarlemmermeer () is a municipality in the west of the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland. Haarlemmermeer is a polder, consisting of land reclaimed from water. The name Haarlemmermeer means &#x27;Haarlem&#x27;s lake&#x27;, referring to the body of water from which the region was reclaimed in the 19th century.

Haarlemmermeer&#x27;s main town is Hoofddorp, which has a population of 76,660. Hoofddorp, along with the rapidly growing towns of Nieuw-Vennep and Badhoevedorp, are part of the Randstad agglomeration. The main international airport of the Netherlands, Schiphol, is located in Haarlemmermeer.

==History==

The original Haarlemmermeer lake is said to have been mostly a peat bog, a relic of a northern arm of the Rhine which passed through the district in Roman times. In 1531, the original Haarlemmermeer had an area of , and near it were three smaller lakes: the Leidsche Meer (Leiden Lake), the Spiering Meer, and the Oude Meer (Old Lake), with a combined area of about .

The four lakes were formed into one by successive floods with the Haarlemmermeer name being applied to the combined lake. Villages disappeared in the process. One of those villages was Vennep, after which the modern Nieuw-Vennep was named. In Dutch, the tendency for lakes to grow over time is called the waterwolf. During the Dutch War of Independence, the waters of the Haarlemmermeer were the scene of the Battle of Haarlemmermeer, a naval engagement between a Spanish fleet and the ships of the Dutch rebels known as &quot;Sea Beggars&quot;, who were trying to break the Siege of Haarlem.
The Haarlemmermeer could be a dangerous place during storms. On 7 January 1629, Frederick Henry of the Palatinate, son and heir of Frederick V, the &quot;Winter King&quot; drowned trying to cross it. By 1647, the new Haarlemmermeer had an area of about , which a century later had increased to over .

In 1643, Jan Adriaanszoon Leeghwater proposed to dike and drain the lake. Similar schemes, among which those of Nicolaus Samuel Cruquius in 1742 and of Baron van Lijnden van Hemmen in 1820, were proposed from time to time. But it was not until a furious hurricane in November 1836 drove the waters as far as the gates of Amsterdam, and another on Christmas Day sent them in the opposite direction to submerge the streets of Leiden, that the matter was seriously considered.

On 1 August 1837, King William I appointed a royal commission of inquiry. Their proposal receiving the sanction of the Dutch Parliament&#x27;s Second Chamber in March 1839, and in the following May the work was begun.

First, a canal was dug around the lake, called &quot;Ringvaart&quot; (Ring Canal), to carry the water drainage and boat and ship traffic which had previously gone across the lake. This canal was long, and deep, and the excavated earth was used to build a dike from wide around the lake. The area enclosed by the canal was more than , and the average depth of the lake . As the water had no natural drainage, it was calculated that probably 1000 million tons of water would have to be raised by mechanical means.
All of the pumping was done by steam mills, an innovation contrasting with the historic practice of draining polders using windmills. Three Cornish beam engines were imported from Hayle: the Leeghwater, the Cruquius (the largest Watt-design reciprocal stroke steam engine ever built and now a museum), and the Lijnden. Pumping began in 1848, and the lake was dry by July 1, 1852; 800 million tons of water were actually discharged. At the first sale of the highest lands along the banks on 16 August 1853, about £28 per acre was paid; but the average price afterwards was less. The whole area of recovered from the waters brought in 9,400,000 guilders, or about £780,000, exactly covering the cost of the enterprise; so that the actual cost to the nation was only the amount of the interest on the capital, or about £368,000.

The soil is of various kinds, loam, clay, sand, and peat. Most of it is fertile enough, though in the lower portions there are barren patches where the scanty vegetation is covered with an ochreous deposit. Mineral springs occur containing a very high percentage (3.245 grams per litre) of common salt; and in 1893 a company was formed to work them.

In 1854, the city of Leiden laid claim to the possession of the new territory, but the courts decided in favor of the nation. Haarlemmermeer became incorporated as a municipality in the province of North Holland by law on 16 July 1855. Its first mayor was Matthijs Samuel Petrus Pabst. The first church was built in the same year and by 1877 there were seven. By 1860 its population was 7237, and 40 years later in 1900, it was 16,621.

Initially agriculture dominated in Haarlemmermeer. But with 99% of the land owned by a few wealthy land owners, poor harvests and low commodity prices, life was very difficult for the tenant farmers. After 1900, the situation improved when commodity prices rose and most farmers owned their own land. Then greenhouse farming developed. Seasonal labourers, attracted by good pay, boosted the population by settling in the villages along the Ringvaart. Maize, seeds, cattle, butter, and cheese were the principal produce. Today, large industrial and office developments have become prominent, especially at Hoofddorp and Schiphol.

The roads which traverse the commune are bordered by pleasant-looking farmhouses built after the various styles of Holland, Friesland and Brabant, reflecting the various origins of the farmers. Hoofddorp, Venneperdorp or Nieuw-Vennep, Abbenes, and the vicinities of the pumping stations are the spots where the population has clustered most densely.

In 1917 a military airport was built near the old fort of Schiphol. Nowadays, Schiphol Airport is the major civilian aviation hub in the Netherlands, using 15% of Haarlemmermeer&#x27;s land area. In 1926, Amsterdam&#x27;s municipal council took over the management of Schiphol. After Stockholm&#x27;s airport, Schiphol was the second airport in Europe to have hardened runways, in 1937–1938. The name &quot;Schiphol&quot; means &quot;ship hole&quot; and refers to the many ships lost due to storms in the former lake.

In the first half of the 20th century, a number of steam railway lines were built in Haarlemmermeer; most were abandoned only a couple of decades later. On 1 January 2019, the municipality of Haarlemmerliede en Spaarnwoude merged with Haarlemmermeer.

==Population centres==
The municipality of Haarlemmermeer contains the following cities, towns and villages: Aalsmeerderbrug, Abbenes, Badhoevedorp, Beinsdorp, Boesingheliede, Buitenkaag, Burgerveen, Cruquius, De Hoek, Haarlemmerliede, Halfweg, Hoofddorp, &#x27;t Kabel, Leimuiderbrug, Lijnden, Lisserbroek, Nieuwe Meer, Nieuwebrug, Nieuw-Vennep, Oude Meer, Penningsveer, Rijsenhout, , Schiphol, Schiphol-Rijk, Spaarndam (partly), Spaarnwoude, Vijfhuizen, Vinkebrug, Weteringbrug, Zwaanshoek, Zwanenburg.

==Monuments and parks==
* Stelling van Amsterdam – the old defense line of Amsterdam crosses the Haarlemmermeer. Plans are being made to make this entire defense line walkable, but currently it is not possible to cross the major highway A4 that goes through it. This park is accessible at various points for recreation, including the Haarlemmermeer Woods.
* Haarlemmermeer Woods (Dutch: &#x27;Haarlemmermeerse Bos&#x27;) – the largest public park in Haarlemmermeer and site of the International garden show Floriade 2002, the park includes a large lake for swimming in the summer and a 40-meter manmade hill called Spotter&#x27;s Hill. The Haarlemmermeer Woods is home to events such as horse shows and the Mysteryland music festival.
* Museum De Cruquius – the Cruquius museum resides in one of the steam mills used to pump the Haarlemmermeer dry and is open to the public for a demonstration of the steam engine and a model of the Netherlands waterways and polders. Because the Cruquius steam engine is the largest ever built, the museum is an Anchor Point of ERIH, The European Route of Industrial Heritage. Behind the museum is a park.

==Economy==
Four airlines, TUI fly Netherlands, KLM Cityhopper, Martinair, and Transavia have their headquarters on the grounds of Schiphol Airport in Haarlemmermeer. The airline alliance SkyTeam has its offices in the World Trade Center Schiphol building on the grounds of Schiphol Airport. Schiphol Group, which operates the airport, has its head office on the airport property. Iran Air has its Netherlands sales office in the World Trade Center building. Nippon Cargo Airlines has its Europe regional offices there as well. Corendon Dutch Airlines has its head office in Lijnden, Haarlemmermeer. Lijnden also has the Amsterdam branch office of Corendon Airlines.

Also, the international organization representing air navigation service providers (air traffic controllers), Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO) has its headquarters in Schiphol Airport.

At one time KLM had its head office on the grounds of Schiphol Airport. Its current head office in Amstelveen had a scheduled completion at the end of 1970. When Air Holland existed, its head office was in Oude Meer, Haarlemmermeer. At one time NLM CityHopper had its head office at the airport.

==Transportation==

In the presence of HM Queen Beatrix, in 2004 three bridges designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava were opened. The bridges span the main canal of the Haarlemmermeer and are named after three string instruments; Harp, Cittern, and Lute.
In 2006 two of those bridges&#x27; structures already displayed clear signs of corrosion, and had to be repaired.

===Aviation===

Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, the principal international airport of the Netherlands, is also situated in Haarlemmermeer.

===Railway===
Nederlandse Spoorwegen, the Dutch National Railways, serves the municipality with three stations: Hoofddorp, Nieuw-Vennep, and Schiphol Airport (which serves high speed rail as well).

There was a network of local steam railways across Harlemmermeer in the early 20th century, the Haarlemmermeer railway lines.
===Water transport===

The Ringvaart is an important waterway for commercial and recreational boats alike. A portion of it forms part of the sailroute from Hollands Diep to the IJsselmeer, passable for ships with masts over 6 meters tall. There is also a connection to the Kaag Lake system (Kagerplassen), which extends to Leiden and beyond.

There are several canals within Haarlemmermeer itself, the main ones are Hoofdvaart (Main Canal) and Kruisvaart (Cross Canal). But these had initially no connection to the outside waterways, meaning that goods had to be reloaded at the ring dike. In 1895 a double canal lock was built at Aalsmeer, boosting the economy. In the 1950s this lock was closed and the canals are once again no longer used for shipping.

===National government===
The Netherlands Aviation Safety Board, during its existence, had its head office in Hoofddorp in Haarlemmermeer. The Dutch Transport Safety Board, the successor agency, was established on 1 July 1999 and the Netherlands Aviation Safety Board was merged into the agency at that time.

<text>Heemskerk ( ) is a municipality and a town in the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland. It is located in the Kennemerland region.

==History==
The town was formed during the Middle Ages. In an official deed from the year of 1063, the town was known as &quot;Hemezen Kyrica&quot;, Latinized Frisian meaning Church of Hemezen, a Frisian nun who lived in a religious house there. Heemskerk knows many historical monuments, among them the &quot;Huldtoneel&quot; (lit. the &quot;Inaugurate Stage&quot;), an artificial hill located near the current Rijksstraatweg, where once the Counts of Holland were inaugurated. According to tradition, the Huldtoneel was used before the Roman Era as a Germanic sanctuary. In the nineteenth century Jonkheer Gevers finally made the Huldtoneel a monument – as it is known today – and ordered passers-by to honour the monument.

Many battles have been fought in Heemskerk. Two castles—Oud Haerlem Castle and Heemskerk Castle—were built in the twelfth and thirteenth century respectively to protect the County of Holland against the West Frisians. In the fifteenth century the residents of Heemskerk fought each other during the Hook and Cod wars, in which both castles were destroyed. The Oud Haerlem castle was never rebuilt, Castle Heemskerk however was. In 1492, a rebellion by the people of Kennemerland was brutally beaten down by the Austrian conquerors, on the place where today the cemetery of the Hervormde Kerk (Reformed Church) is located.
In 1610, the Castle Heemskerk was renamed to Castle Marquette and was at first the residence for many nobles and later inhabited by patricians. The last noble family that lived there were the House of Gevers. Today Castle Marquette is owned by the Spanish hotelgroup NH Hoteles and is the site of many weddings, conferences, and company courses, while the estate grounds are favoured for wedding photos.

Located on the eastside of Heemskerk is Castle Assumburg, built from the remains of Kasteel Oud Haerlem in 1546. The Nederlandse Hervormde Kerk (Dutch Reformed Church) at the Nielenplein and Kerkplein is built in 1628, but it has a tower from the Middle Ages. In the graveyard around the church is a copy of a monument dedicated to the father of painter Maarten van Heemskerck. The original is located inside the church.

===Agricultural village===

After the time of knights and nobles, Heemskerk remained a small, quiet village near the dunes. Its residents, who mainly worked in agriculture and keeping cattle, had good, but also some very bad times. From the time that products—mainly strawberries for the neighbouring town Beverwijk, where the fruits were sold—were brought to the market with donkeys, people from Heemskerk got the name of Donkey as a nickname and symbol.

The former town hall was built in 1911 after a design by Jan Stuyt and was raised with an additional floor in 1949. Today this is the building where Janssen&#x27;s notary office is located. The Roman Catholic Laurentiuskerk, designed by architect J. H. Tonnaer, was completed in 1891 and is a rare example of a Catholic church in Holland in a neo-renaissance style. There is nothing left of other historical monuments, like Castle Oud Haerlem.

<text>Heemstede () is a town and a municipality in the Western Netherlands, in the province of North Holland. In 2021, it had a population of 27,545. Located just south of the city of Haarlem on the border with South Holland, it is one of the richest municipalities of the Netherlands.

== History ==
Heemstede formed around the Heemstede Castle that was built overlooking the Spaarne River around 1286. Before 1296, Floris V, Count of Holland, granted Heemstede as a fiefdom to Reinier of Holy. During the 14th century, a village formed near the castle, which was destroyed and rebuilt several times in this period. A resident of this castle was Adriaan Pauw, who bought it in 1620. In 1653, Bennebroek split off from Heemstede, becoming a separate fiefdom.
Growth was slow; in 1787 Heemstede counted 196 families. Even at that early date Heemstede had gained the reputation it has today, of being primarily a commuter town for the cities of Haarlem and Amsterdam. Wealthy city families left the cities in the summer, escaping &quot;canal fever&quot; which caused illness from the putrid canals. As a result, many estates were built in the 17th and 18th centuries, some of which (partially) remain today, such as Oud-Berkenroede, Berkenrode, Ipenrode, Huis te Manpad, Hartekamp, Bosbeek, Meer en Bosch, Meer en Berg, and Gliphoeve.

In 1857, the municipality Berkenrode was merged with Heemstede. In 1927, the northern portion of Heemstede, including a large part of the Haarlemmerhout forest, was added to the city of Haarlem.

== Monuments and parks ==
*Groenendaal Park: Designed by Jan Hope, it was formed by merging several country estates into one.
*&quot;Vrijheidsbeeld&quot; (Freedom Statue), statue by Mari Andriessen to celebrate freedom and commemorate Heemstede victims of the Dutch Revolt. Located on the Vrijheidsdreef in Groenendaal park.
*Heemstede Castle: The site of the former Heemstede castle.
*Hartekamp: Heemstede summer home of George Clifford, who hired Carl Linnaeus to write his &quot;Hortus Cliffortianus&quot;, a detailed catalogue of the plant specimens in the herbarium and gardens of Hartecamp.

<text>Heerhugowaard (; West Frisian Dutch: &quot;Heerhugoweard&quot;, &quot;Heregeweard&quot; or &quot;De Weard&quot;) is a city in the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland and the region of West Friesland.

Heerhugowaard was previously a separate municipality, which merged with the former municipality of Langedijk into the new municipality of Dijk en Waard on 1 January 2022.

== History ==
Around the year 800, the area of the modern Heerhugowaard was covered in peat fen. Because of peat-digging and storm floods, many lakes developed in the region, including the Heerhugowaard. The name is derived from word (&#x27;heer&#x27; in Dutch) Hugo van Assendelft who was killed by the West Frisians in this area in 1296. After two storms in 1248, the abbey of Egmond, which had much property in this region, built the &quot;Schagerdam&quot; at Schagen. This became part of the Westfriese Omringdijk, which protected the pentagon Schagen - Alkmaar - Medemblik - Enkhuizen - Hoorn.

Uncontrollable increase of the lake had been prevented. In the 17th century private investors decided to drain the lake to create farmland. In 1630 the polder was drained and the of land was divided among the investors. In contrast to e.g. the Beemster, the new land was poor quality, and in 1674 there was a proposal to refill the polder, as fishing would be more profitable.

A recent event in the history of Heerhugowaard was the unexpected victory of Princess Margriet at the first-ever &quot;Keegelfestival&quot; of 1961. This bowling festival was an annual event until 1984, when the organising bowling club declared bankruptcy due to financial mismanagement.

== Geography ==
Heerhugowaard is part of the province of North-Holland and is located in the west of the Netherlands. The land reclamation of Heerhugowaard is situated 3 metres under sea level. The surrounding land is flat as it is formed of large polders. To the southwest of the city lies Alkmaar.

=== Topography ===
&quot;Map of Heerhugowaard (town), 2014.&quot;

=== Climate ===
Heerhugowaard has a cool oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;), strongly influenced by its proximity to the North Sea to the west, with prevailing north-western winds and gales. Winter temperatures are cool to mild. Heerhugowaard, as well as most of North-Holland province, lies in USDA Hardiness zone 9, the northernmost such occurrence in continental Europe. Frosts mainly occur during spells of easterly or northeasterly winds from the inner European continent, from Scandinavia, Russia, or even Siberia. Even then, because Heerhugowaard is surrounded on three sides by large bodies of water, as well as enjoying a significant heat island effect, nights rarely fall below . Summers are moderately warm but rarely hot. The average daily high in August is . 

Heerhugowaard&#x27;s average annual rainfall is , with measurable precipitation on an average of 189 days per year. Most is in the form of protracted drizzle or light rain, making cloudy and damp days common during the cooler months of October to March. Only the occasional European windstorm brings significant rain in a short period of time, requiring it to be pumped out to higher ground or to the seas around the city.

== Cityscape ==
=== Population centres ===
The former municipality of Heerhugowaard consisted of the following towns, villages and/or districts: Broekhorn, Butterhuizen, De Noord, Draai, Frik, Kabel, &#x27;t Kruis, Veenhuizen, Verlaat, Oostertocht, Bomenwijk, Schilderswijk, Rivierenwijk, Edelstenenwijk, Stad van de Zon.

=== Expansion ===

In May 2007, Heerhugowaard welcomed its 50,000th inhabitant, exceeding 58,000 by 2021. For several years in the 1970s, Heerhugowaard was the fastest growing municipality in the Netherlands. It is expected that by around 2050, Heerhugowaard will have approximately 100,000 inhabitants, although young people are moving away, so this number might never be reached. 

The major part of the population lives in so-called Vinex-districts. The rural core of the North lies in the Middenwaard. The core of the south is at Stationsweg by the old church. In the polders there are small hamlets. The greater part of the town is new developments. Heerhugowaard has a number of subdivisions which were set up the same as in Almere, for example the writer district, the tree district, the planet district, and the nature area of Butterhuizen. In two of the newest districts, called Stad van de Zon I and II (= City of the Sun I and II) the energy supplies for a considerable part comes from solar energy.

<text>Heiloo () is a municipality and town in the Netherlands, located in the province of North Holland. The community is part of the cooperation region Kennemerland and is located in the historical region of West Friesland. Heiloo had a population of in .

==Origins of the name==
Heiloo (from the Dutch &quot;heilige loo&quot;, &quot;sacred forest&quot;) was given its name because Saint Willibrord was said to have performed a miracle there around 690 and created a church on a small hill.

==Notable attractions==
It has a town hall dating from 1926 and a church from the 12th century known as the &quot;Witte Kerk&quot;. In the late Middle Ages a Marian shrine came into being for Our Lady to Need (&quot;Onze Lieve Vrouwe ter Nood&quot;). The chapel was partially destroyed in 1573 during the Spanish Siege of Alkmaar, and it was completely demolished in 1637. Before it was razed to the ground, the Alkmaar painter Gerrit Pietersz. de Jongh depicted a family on a pilgrimage at the ruins of the single wall left remaining after the siege. Pilgrimage started to flourish again in 1713 when a spring started to sprout where the chapel had stood. The Marian sanctuary, situated outside the village in a so-called procession park, is one of the major pilgrimage destinations in the Netherlands, attracting pilgrims mainly from the diocese of Haarlem-Amsterdam.
In the 1950s and 1960s the population grew quickly as many residents of Amsterdam moved to the area. Many residents work and attend school in the neighbouring city of Alkmaar.

== Sporting clubs ==
* FCC Boscrossers – The local BMX club has produced 5 World Champions, 4 European Champions and many National Champions. The 2013 17-24-year-old Double World Champion for 20&quot; and Cruiser Class was Robin Van Der Kolk, who won both titles in Auckland New Zealand.
* AV Trias – The local athletics club has produced 2 Olympic athletes, Lisanne de Witte and Laura de Witte.

==Local government==

* Heiloo 2000 – 5 seats
* VVD – 3 seats
* PvdA – 3 seats
* D66 – 3 seats
* CDA – 2 seats
* Local Interest Heiloo (&quot;Gemeentebelangen&quot;) – 2 seats
* Heiloo Local – 1 seat

== Railway connections ==
Connections from Heiloo railway station include: Alkmaar, Hoorn, Uitgeest, Zaandam, Amsterdam, Utrecht, &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, Eindhoven, The Hague, Weert, Roermond, Maastricht and Heerlen.

Until October 2013 there was a second stop on the railway line between Heiloo and Limmen, used once a month to bring pilgrims to the nearby chapel. The name of both station and chapel was &#x27;Onze lieve vrouwe ter nood&#x27; or &#x27;Our Lady to Need&#x27;; the station was known as Runxputte until 1914. One of the platforms was demolished in 1997 for safety reasons.

<text>Hoorn () is a city and municipality in the northwest of the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland. It is the largest town and the traditional capital of the region of West Friesland. Hoorn is located on the Markermeer, 20 kilometers (12 mi) east of Alkmaar and 35 kilometers (22 mi) north of Amsterdam. The municipality has just over 75,000 inhabitants and a land area of , making it the third most densely populated municipality in North Holland after Haarlem and Amsterdam. Apart from the city of Hoorn, the municipality includes the villages of Blokker and Zwaag, as well as parts of the hamlets , De Hulk and .

Hoorn is well known in the Netherlands for its rich history. The town acquired city rights in 1357 and flourished during the Dutch Golden Age. In this period, Hoorn developed into a prosperous port city, being home to one of the six chambers of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). Towards the end of the eighteenth century, however, it started to become increasingly more difficult for Hoorn to keep competing with nearby Amsterdam. Ultimately, it lost its function as port city and became a regional center of trade, mainly serving the smaller villages of West Friesland. Nowadays, Hoorn is a city with modern residential areas and a historic city center that, due to its proximity to Amsterdam, is sometimes considered to be part of the Randstad metropolitan area. Cape Horn and the Hoorn Islands were both named after this city.

==Etymology==

The origin of the name Hoorn – in archaic spelling Hoern, Horne or Hoirn(e) – is surrounded in myths. According to old Frisian legends, the name comes from Hornus, a bastard son of King Redbad and brother of Aldgillis II, who presumably founded the city in 719 and named it after himself. A different theory claims that the name was derived from a sign depicting a post horn, which hung from one of the taverns established by brewers from Hamburg in the early fourteenth century.

According to Hadrianus Junius, the name could also be a reference to the city&#x27;s horn-shaped port. Others believed that the name was derived from , a weed with a hollow stem that grew in the area at the time of the city&#x27;s establishment. The chronicler rejects this theory, as well as the assertion that the name comes from &quot;Dampterhorn&quot;, which was thought to be the only remaining neighborhood of the flooded village of .

One of the earliest mentions of Hoorn is found in a letter which states that in 1303, a merchant from Bruges was imprisoned in West Friesland near a place called &quot;Hornicwed&quot;. This phrase – although it is uncertain whether it actually refers to Hoorn – is a compound of the Middle Dutch words , meaning &quot;corner&quot;, and , meaning &quot;shallow water&quot;. It is likely that the name Hoorn was indeed derived from Middle Dutch , or simply , and that the city was named for its location in a sharp bight of (the former) Lake Flevo.

As a descendant of the reconstructed Proto-Germanic &quot;*hurnijǭ&quot;, the name Hoorn is a cognate with Danish and Norwegian , Icelandic , Swedish , and West Frisian , which have all preserved the meaning of &quot;corner&quot;. In Modern Dutch, however, the word translates to &quot;horn&quot;, both in an acoustic and anatomical sense.

In the beginning of the eighth century, the threat of Viking raids led to unrest in the Frisian Kingdom, causing many people to leave their hometowns and settle elsewhere. Following this example, Hornus – a bastard son of Redbad – allegedly moved westward along with his companions and, in 719, built a settlement west of the river Vlie, which he named after himself. This legendary settlement did not exist for long, as it burnt down only a few years later.

In the Late Middle Ages, the site of present-day Hoorn was a swampy area that was not at all suitable for agriculture, as opposed to the more fertile inland. Here, overproduction of dairy products led to the establishment of a marketplace within the domain of Zwaag, where excesses could be traded for other goods. This marketplace was located near a sluice in the river Gouw, which was the most convenient passage into the Zuiderzee for the surrounding villages.

The marketplace attracted many foreign traders, most notably from Hamburg and Bremen, who came to sell their goods (mostly beer) to the local population in return for butter and cheese. This also brought three brothers from Hamburg to the area, who recognized its convenient location and decided to each build an inn near the marketplace to increase the sale of their beers. The construction of these buildings was completed in 1316 and led to the expansion of the settlement, as more merchants from Northern Germany and Denmark now visited the place to trade. As a result, the settlement quickly developed into a village, which was then given the name of Hoorn. The town officially became a city in 1357, when Hoorn was awarded city rights by William V, Count of Holland, after a lump sum payment of 1,550 schilden.

=== The Dutch Revolt ===
The revolution in Hoorn occurred without bloodshed. The town’s middle classes, after a futile attempt to assert Hoorn’s wish to garrison neither the Spanish army nor the rebel Sea Beggars, and after much debate, voted to open the city’s gates to the Beggars. By that time, Hoorn had already been flanked by the Beggar control of nearby Enkhuizen and Medemblik, and many rebellious exiles from earlier troubles returned to influence the town’s politics.

=== Dutch Golden Age ===
Hoorn rapidly grew to become a major port city and a prosperous center of trade, which flourished during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, also known as the Dutch Golden Age. It was the seat of the Committed Councils of West Friesland and the Noorderkwartier () from 1573 to 1795, and the seat of the Admiralty of the Noorderkwartier from 1589 to 1795, together with Enkhuizen. Furthermore, the city was an important home base for the Dutch East India Company (VOC), the Dutch West India Company (WIC) and the Noordsche Compagnie.

The city&#x27;s fleet plied the seven seas and returned laden with precious commodities from the East Indies. Exotic spices such as pepper, nutmeg, cloves and mace were sold at vast profits. With their skill in trade and seafaring, sons of Hoorn established the city&#x27;s name far and wide. In 1619, Jan Pieterszoon Coen (1587–1629), controversial for his violent raids in Southeast Asia, &quot;founded&quot; the capital of the Dutch East Indies, which he intended to name New Hoorn at first, though it was later decided that its name would be Batavia (present-day Jakarta). A statue of Coen was placed on the city&#x27;s central square Roode Steen in 1893. In 1616, the explorer Willem Schouten, together with Jacob Le Maire, braved furious storms as he rounded the southernmost tip of South America. He named it (Cape Horn) in honor of his home town.

=== Eighteenth century to present ===

Hoorn&#x27;s fortunes declined somewhat in the eighteenth century. The prosperous trading port became little more than a sleepy fishing village on the Zuiderzee. Following Napoleonic occupation, there was a period during which the town gradually turned its back on the sea. It developed to become a regional center of trade, mainly serving the smaller villages of West Friesland. Stallholders and shopkeepers devoted themselves to the sale of dairy products and seeds. After the introduction of railways and metalled roads in the late nineteenth century, Hoorn rapidly took its place as a conveniently located and easily accessible hub in the network of towns and villages of North Holland. In 1932, the Afsluitdijk was completed, and Hoorn was no longer a seaport.

The years after World War II saw a period of renewed growth. At the center of a flourishing horticultural region, the city developed a highly varied and dynamic economy. In the 1970s, Hoorn was designated as an &quot;overflow&quot; city () by the Dutch government to relieve pressure on the overcrowded Randstad region. As a consequence, thousands of people swapped their cramped little apartments in Amsterdam for a family house with a garden in one of Hoorn&#x27;s newly developed residential areas.

== Geography ==

Hoorn is located in the east of the North Holland peninsula, on the northwestern shore of the Markermeer – the second largest freshwater lake of the Netherlands. The city occupies an arc of land in the south of West Friesland at the northernmost end of a small bay named Hoornse Hop. The landscape of Hoorn is mostly flat and the only elevated areas are the dikes on the southern outskirts of the city. The municipality is part of the safety region and the water board .

The harbor was enlarged in the mid-17th century by the construction of a peninsula, the Visserseiland (to the west of the harbor), and an artificial island, the Oostereiland (to the east).

=== Climate ===

Hoorn has an oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb) strongly influenced by its proximity to the North Sea to the west, with prevailing westerly winds. Both winters and summers are considered mild, although winters can get quite cold, while summers are quite warm occasionally.

Hoorn, as well as most of the North Holland province, lies in USDA hardiness zone 8b. Frosts mainly occur during spells of easterly or northeasterly winds from the inner European continent. Even then, because Hoorn is surrounded on three sides by large bodies of water, nights rarely fall far below .

Summers are moderately warm with a number of hot days every month. The average daily high in August is , and or higher is only measured on 1.8 days per year on average (2009–2018), placing Hoorn in AHS heat zone 2. It is also common to have at least a couple of snowy days each year.

The Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute has one of its weather stations located in Berkhout, a village situated west of Hoorn. Climatological data from this station can be found in the table below. The record extremes range from to . The average annual precipitation is .

== International relations ==
=== Partner cities ===
Hoorn is twinned with the following cities and municipalities:
* Beersel, Belgium (since 1968)
* Příbram, Czech Republic (since 1992)

=== Friendships ===
* Lewes, Delaware, United States
: Lewes was the site of the first European settlement in Delaware: a whaling and trading post that Dutch settlers led by David Pieterszoon de Vries established in 1631 and named Zwaanendael. Upon their arrival in the Delaware Bay, they entered a kill which De Vries named &quot;Hoornkill&quot; after his hometown Hoorn. Nowadays, the city&#x27;s Zwaanendael Museum is located in a replica of the Statenlogement, the former city hall of Hoorn. Although Hoorn and Lewes have never officially been partner cities, there is close informal relationship between the two towns. Delegations from Hoorn and Lewes have visited each other&#x27;s cities in light of Lewes&#x27;s 375th and Hoorn&#x27;s 650th anniversary in 2006 and 2007 respectively.

* Malacca City, Malaysia (since 1989)
: In 1641, the Dutch conquered the colony of Malacca from the Portuguese. During the Dutch rule, the iconic Stadthuys was built – a replica of the first city hall of Hoorn, which was demolished in 1797. Hoorn and Malacca became sister cities in 1989, but the partnership was officially ended in 2005. The cities still maintain an informal relationship as &quot;friendship cities&quot;.

<text>Huizen () is a municipality and a village in the province of North Holland, the Netherlands. 

The name &quot;Huizen&quot; is Dutch for &quot;houses&quot; and this usage has been linked to the belief that the first stone houses in the region, instead of the more common sod houses of the time, appeared here. Huizen is part of the metropolitan area of Amsterdam.

==History==
Huizen was originally an agricultural village, near the Zuiderzee until 1932. During winter the farmers went fishing, which started the development from an agricultural to a coastal village with a thriving fishing industry, stimulated by building the harbour around 1850. After the damming of the Zuiderzee in 1932, the old sea became a lake, and economic activity shifted towards industry and commerce.

In the 1960s the town was designated to build substantially large residential areas, to overcome the housing shortage in the region. From then on, the village took on an influx of people and grew rapidly.

Where the Phohi-flat now stands in Huizen, before World War II was a large transmitter intended to contact the Dutch East Indies, some 12.000 km away.

A post mill that stood in Huizen was dismantled in 1916. It was re-erected in 1919 at the Netherlands Open Air Museum, Arnhem, Gelderland.

==Topography==
Huizen is part of the Gooi area, well known as the home of the rich and famous.

<text>Medemblik () is a municipality and a city in the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland and the region of West-Frisia. It lies immediately south of the polder and former municipality of Wieringermeer.

== History ==
Medemblik was a prosperous trading town, when in 1282, Floris V, Count of Holland, successfully invaded West Friesland. He built several fortresses to control the region, one of which was Kasteel Radboud in Medemblik, and awarded Medemblik city rights in 1289. After Floris V was murdered in 1296, the local Frisians besieged the castle, but in 1297 an army from Holland thwarted their efforts to starve out the inhabitants, which included Medemblik citizens.

Several more attacks took place in the following centuries. The most notorious of these happened in June 1517, when Medemblik was attacked from mainland Frisia by about 4000 pirates known as the Arumer Zwarte Hoop, led by Pier Gerlofs Donia and Wijard Jelckama. Many citizens fled to the castle, which the pirates unsuccessfully besieged. Eventually, they took out their fury on the town, which burned to the ground. After this the band continued their marauding path on land throughout present day North Holland.

After Medemblik town walls were constructed in 1572, the castle lost its role as a refuge for the citizens, which led to its partially dismantling in 1578. Over the centuries the castle fell into decay, but in 1889 it became property of the crown and was restored to be used as a courthouse, which function it served until 1934. Anticipating the German invasion, the Rijksmuseum in September 1939 chose the castle as the initial hiding place of Rembrandt&#x27;s Night Watch.

On 1 January 2007 Medemblik merged with the municipalities of Noorder-Koggenland and Wognum. The new municipality was called Medemblik, even though it was the smallest of the three in population. Again, on 1 January 2011, Medemblik merged with Andijk and Wervershoof into the municipality Medemblik.

The new city hall is the former office building of the DSB Bank in Wognum.

==Tourism==
Medemblik is best known in Europe for its sailing events. Medemblik also has a picturesque small innercity with many 17th and 18th century houses, two big churches, an old orphanage, a town hall and, of course, castle Radboud, which is at the edger of the innercity.
The city also hosts the Medemblik steam museum, housed in a decommissioned pumping station.

==Transport==
A heritage railway connects Medemblik with Hoorn.

==Local government ==

<doc id="120160" wikidata="Q9948" url="?curid=120160" title="Muiden">
<text>Muiden () is a city and former municipality in the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland. It lies at the mouth of the Vecht and is in an area called the Vechtstreek. Since 2016, Muiden has been part of the new municipality of Gooise Meren.

==History==
The first known reference to Muiden is from 953 when Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor, granted the settlement and its toll rights to the Cathedral of Saint Martin, Utrecht. It was called &quot;Amuda&quot;, meaning &quot;mouth of the (river) A&quot;. &quot;A&quot; was the old name for the Vecht river.

In 1122 Muiden was, together with Utrecht, granted some city rights by Emperor Henry V. After the lands around Muiden were given to Count Floris V, he began building Muider Castle at the mouth of the Vecht river. Muiden once again received city rights in 1296.

The first defensive works date from the first half of the 15th century. In 1590 the walls were replaced with earthen mounds with bastions after a design by Adriaen Anthonisz. Muiden was the northern end of the Dutch Water Line.

In 1673 the sea lock in the Vecht river was relocated from Fort Hinderdam to Muiden and in 1676 it was expanded with a sea wall along the Vecht mouth to prevent flooding.

Developments in warfare during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 prompted modernisation, with the construction of forts, part of the Stelling van Amsterdam, which included the Muizenfort, the barracks on the Vestingplein, and the casemates in the ravelins. The layout of the fortification wall was revised.

Fort Pampus Island, part of the former municipality of Muiden, was built from 1887 to 1897. Together with the lighthouse island near Durgerdam and the artillery battery at the Diemer seawall, it was meant to protect the entrance of the IJ Bay and the harbour of Amsterdam.

== Geography ==
The former municipality of Muiden had two population centers: Muiden and Muiderberg.

==Attractions==

* Muiderslot (Muider Castle), a well-preserved castle from the Middle Ages
* Muizenfort, (Mice Fort) a 19th-century fortification part of the Stelling van Amsterdam
* Fort Pampus Island is an artificial island that is part of the Defence Line of Amsterdam (Dutch: &quot;Stelling van Amsterdam&quot;).

Various regional walking and cycling routes pass Muiden.

==Gunpowder factory==
In 1702 the hazardous production of gunpowder was removed from the city of Amsterdam. The vroedschap of Muiden granted a permit to Reinier van Cuyk of Amsterdam to build a gunpowder mill just west of Muiden that same year.

The factory flourished during the First World War, was liquidated in 1919, and was restarted in 1922. During the 20th century its production steadily increased and the town grew towards the factory. In 1972 it was renamed &quot;Muiden Chemie&quot;. In the 1980s, it was accused of illegal shipments to Iran. In 1990 Muiden Chemie went bankrupt and was taken over by the British company Royal Ordnance, part of British Aerospace. After a fire in 2001 and ongoing concerns over safety, it was decided to close the factory permanently.

Explosions since 1883:
* January 9, 1883: explosion on the factory premises, resulting in 13 deaths and much damage to the factory and Muiden.
* 1886: explosion, 2 deaths. Destroyed a part of the factory.
* 1924/1925: several explosions, 1 death.
* January 17, 1947: explosion of collected grenades on the factory premises, 17 deaths and much damage in Muiden.
* 1948: a grenade exploded, 1 death.
* 1949: explosion in a powder mill, 1 death.
* June 13, 1963: explosion in the storage depot, no casualties.
* June 2, 1966: explosion in the TNT factory, many injuries and much damage in Muiden.
* December 8, 1972: explosion in drying chamber, 2 deaths, much damage in Muiden.
* May 30, 1983: explosion, 3 deaths.
* September 9, 1983: explosion, 1 death.
* August 20, 2001: fire in packing materials storage, no explosions, no casualties.

== Local government ==
Marleen de Pater-van der Meer of the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) was the last mayor of Muiden. The municipal council of Muiden consisted of 13 seats, which were divided as follows at the 2014 local elections:
* People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD): 3 seats
* Labour Party (PvdA): 3 seats
* Democrats 66 (D66): 3 seats
* Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA): 2 seats
* Ons Muiden Muiderberg: 2 seats

There was an election in November 2015 for the council for the new merged Gooise Meren municipality that commenced work on 1 January 2016, replacing Muiden council.

==Notable people==

*Abraham Samson Onderwijzer (1862–1934), rabbi and labour union founder

<text>Brooklyn Center is a first-ring suburban city in Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area. In 1911, the area became a village formed from parts of Brooklyn Township and Crystal Lake Township. In 1966, Brooklyn Center became a charter city. The city has commercial and industrial development. The majority of land use is single-family homes. The population was 33,782 at the 2020 census, and the city has become the most ethnically diverse community in the state.

==History==
Pioneers organized town governments for Brooklyn Township and Crystal Lake Township when Minnesota became a state in 1858. Osseo Road was a main thoroughfare that brought settlers to an area centered around their school, post office, store, meeting hall, and Baptist and Methodist churches. That location thrived as a market gardening community. It abutted the encroaching development of Minneapolis to the south.

Steps were taken to protect the area from annexation by Minneapolis and to retain &quot;simpler public business methods, and extra police protection&quot; by incorporation. The Hennepin County Board of Commissioners accepted a petition to incorporate the Village of Brooklyn Center on January 16, 1911. An election followed, the boundaries were set, and documents filed with the state on February 18, 1911. P.W. Reidhead was the first president. The population was 500.

By 1940, the village saw a need for more organized planning to deal with issues such as sewage and traffic. In 1942, a Planning Commission was established. Farmers were selling their valuable land to housing developers. The decade saw unprecedented population growth, reaching 4,000 by 1950. Brookdale, a new shopping concept by Dayton’s, was constructed in 1960 when the population had grown to over 24,000. In 1963, even more new opportunities for commercial development were presented with the estate of Earle Brown, deceased, the heir of Captain John Martin who had been one of the wealthiest men in Minneapolis.

Heritage Center of Brooklyn Center was the former Cap Martin country estate, built in 1878 and willed to his grandson Earle Brown in 1901. The buildings included the family home, office and garage, housing for the workers, a pump house, multiple barns, a hippodrome, an antique carriage collection, and a restored lumber bunkhouse and cook shanty. It is now a historic site in Brooklyn Center owned by the city and developed into a conference and event center. 
In April 2021, Daunte Wright was killed by a city police officer. Due to elevated racial tensions and anti-police sentiment because of the concurrent Derek Chauvin trial, riots and looting broke out. California Congresswoman Maxine Waters traveled to the city to hold a rally for the protestors, which only encouraged the rioting. The city worked with Juxtaposition Arts on a permanent memorial to Wright.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. All of Brooklyn Center is in the Upper Mississippi Watershed Basin. The Mississippi River is the eastern boundary of the city and is part of the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area of Minnesota. The North Mississippi Regional Park, at 5700 Lyndale Avenue North, is managed by Three Rivers Park District Board, on which Brooklyn Center is represented in District 3.

Southwestern Brooklyn Center includes Upper Twin Lake (117 acres) and connects to a chain of lakes that discharge into Shingle Creek, which discharges into the Mississippi River. Shingle Creek also runs through Palmer Lake. The city is a member of Shingle Creek and West Mississippi Watershed Management Commission, which manages the lakes, streams, and wetlands in this area. Palmer Lake Park is a natural environmental preserve of lake and marsh habitat on over 200 acres.

All of Brooklyn Center is in the state&#x27;s Deciduous Forest Biome. The Plant Hardiness Zone is 4B, with an average minimum extreme temperature of -25 to -20 Fahrenheit. The city has developed and maintains 26 parks and a 20-mile trail system. The majority of land use is single-family homes. The historical route, Osseo Road, was renamed Brooklyn Boulevard by both Brooklyn Center and Brooklyn Park in 1969. Interstates 94 and 694 and Minnesota State Highways 100 and 252 are four of the main routes in Brooklyn Center.

<text>Naarden () is a city and former municipality in the Gooi region in the province of North Holland, Netherlands. It has been part of the new municipality of Gooise Meren since 2016.

==History==
Naarden was granted its city rights in 1300 (the only town in the Gooi with these rights) and later developed into a fortified garrison town with a textile industry. 

In 1572, the city was sacked and burnt down, and only 60 people survived the Massacre of Naarden. The massacre was committed by Spanish soldiers against the townspeople of Naarden as part of a punitive expedition against Dutch rebels later known as the Spanish Fury. The destruction of the city galvanized the Dutch rebels, leading them to continue the Dutch War of Independence against Spain.

Naarden is an example of a star fort, complete with fortified walls and a moat. The moat and walls have been restored on numerous occasions, most notably during the French era (1795-1814). After the Battle of Leipzig (1813), the Netherlands were liberated by an allied force of Dutch, Prussian and Russian armies. During this period, Naarden was besieged for months since the French commander didn&#x27;t believe that Napoleon was captured. In May 1814, the French soldiers left the city in a retreat with honour (see Siege of Naarden (1813–1814).

John Amos Comenius, 17th century Moravian born Czech educator was buried in the city, and his mausoleum is open to visitors.

Despite its earlier importance, Naarden&#x27;s population was surpassed by Hilversum in the 18th century and today it is smaller than its neighbour Bussum.
The city&#x27;s distinctive shape made it a rallying point for Allied bombers returning to England after raids on Germany. 

Naarden was a separate municipality until 2015. On 1 January 2016, the municipality of Naarden merged with Muiden and Bussum to form the new municipality of Gooise Meren.

==Economy==
The company Stork B.V. had its head office in Naarden.

==Geography==
The city of Naarden is located in the municipality of Gooise Meren in the west of the Netherlands. It is situated in the Gooi region in the southeast of the province of North Holland.

===Attractions===
Naarden is the home of the Dutch Fortress Museum (&quot;Nederlands Vestingmuseum&quot;). Naarden hosts the bi-annual Naarden Photo Festival and, on Good Friday, a performance of Bach&#x27;s St. Matthew Passion in the local church, which is called the Great Church or St. Vitus Church.

The Great Church (&quot;Grote Kerk&quot;) in Marktstraat dates from the 15th century. Prior to the Protestant Reformation it was named for St. Vitus. It is one of the oldest surviving churches in The Netherlands, having had the good fortune to survive the Spanish invasion of 1572 and the subsequent burning of the town. The church has numerous wooden vaults painted with scenes from the Old and New Testaments. These were hidden for many years and only rediscovered in a recent restoration. The church is the venue for a number of cultural activities such as organ music nights and the bi-annual Naarden Photo festival.

The Spanish House (&quot;Spaanse Huis&quot;), situated at Turfpoortstraat 27, was originally a church building converted to house migrants. In 1572 Spanish troops conducted a massacre of some 700 inhabitants who had gathered to hear a peace proposal. The Spanish then fired on the assembled citizens, and went on to set fire to the town. A plaque above the lintel of the door and below the eaves commemorates the massacre. In 1615, after the population had reestablished itself, they built the city hall on the site. Part of the building was given over to De Waag (The Scales House), the municipal office entrusted with the verification of weights and measures. The building later served a French garrison as a bakery, turning out over 1000 loaves per day. From 1967 until 1992 it served as the Comenius museum. Today, the historic building serves as the Weegschaal Museum.

John Amos Comenius is buried in a mausoleum on Klooster straat. This receives many visitors from the Czech Republic, where he was born. Comenius is known as the inventor of our school system with grades and different classes.

<text>Champlin ( ) is a city in Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 23,919 at the 2020 census. Champlin is a northern suburb of Minneapolis.

U.S. Highway 169 and Hennepin County Road 12 (CR 12) are two of the main routes in Champlin.

==Geography==
Champlin lies along the Mississippi River, surrounded by the cities of Anoka, Dayton, Brooklyn Park, Maple Grove and Coon Rapids, northwest of Minneapolis.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water.

The average elevation is above sea level, and the Mississippi River is approximately one-eighth of a mile wide throughout Champlin.

==History==

The Champlin area was first settled when Father Louis Hennepin, a Franciscan priest from whom Hennepin County gets its name, Michael Accult, and Peter Dulay were captured by Lakota Indians. An Indian trading post was later established in the area. Charles Miles created the first permanent settlement in what came to be named Marshall Township. In 1859, it was split into two towns, Champlin and Dayton.
Champlin&#x27;s name came from U.S. Navy Commodore Stephen Champlin. He was active in the war against England and Canada in 1812 and in the establishment of the Canadian–United States boundary. He died in 1870 in Buffalo, New York.

On August 30, 1853, Stephen Champlin&#x27;s daughter, Eliza Ellen Champlin, married John B. Cook, a partner of Minnesota&#x27;s Alexander Ramsey. Cook never resided in Champlin, but he was involved in real estate transactions there and in its incorporation. In 1947, part of the former Champlin Township was incorporated to form the village of Champlin, and on January 2, 1971, as the result of a petitioned order from the Minnesota Municipal Commission, Champlin Township and the village of Champlin consolidated to form the city of Champlin.

==Education==
The Champlin area is served by Anoka-Hennepin School District 11, with four primary schools, Champlin-Brooklyn Park Academy for Math and Environmental Science, Oxbow Creek Elementary, Jackson Middle School, and Champlin Park High School. All the schools are clustered in a neighborhood near the intersection of 109th Avenue North and Douglas Avenue North. Oxbow Creek Elementary School is in Brooklyn Park.

Champlin Elementary School was built in 1938 to serve the primary educational needs of Champlin&#x27;s schoolchildren. It served approximately 350 students in the 1st through 5th grades each year—about 1/3 as many as the newer Oxbow Creek Elementary, about away. Champlin Elementary School received students directly from the Park View Early Childhood Center (converted to the Champlin-Brooklyn Park Academy for Math and Environmental Science in 2011). It closed in 2010, due to financial cuts in the district, and has been put up for sale by the city. It merged with Riverview Elementary School to make the Champlin–Brooklyn Academy of Math and Environmental Science. Students began attending the new school during the 2010–11 school year.

Champlin Park High School is one of the state&#x27;s largest high schools, with approximately 2,975 students in 9th through 12th grades. It is in the Northwest Suburban Conference with large athletic and music programs. Champlin Park High receives students directly from Jackson Middle School.

Jackson Middle School was expanded in 2001 to become one of the state&#x27;s largest junior high schools. A completely new campus for Oxbow Creek Elementary was built about two blocks southwest of the existing campus. Jackson Middle School then expanded into the former Oxbow Creek Elementary building. In 2006, Jackson Middle School built an observatory, which hosts public viewing nights and provides astronomy education to both its and other Anoka–Hennepin students. Jackson Middle School enrolls approximately 2,356 students in 6th through 8th grades. It receives students directly from Champlin-Brooklyn Park Academy for Math and Environmental Science, Dayton Elementary School, Oxbow Creek Elementary, and Monroe Elementary.

Oxbow Creek Elementary&#x27;s new facility opened in 2001. It is an exact match to Rum River Elementary School, as the school district used the same blueprints to build the two at the same time. Oxbow Creek Elementary provides educational services to 1,090 students in kindergarten through 5th grades.

Champlin–Brooklyn Park Academy for Math and Environmental Science, formerly Park View Kindergarten, provides kindergarten through 5th grade math and environmental science education.

<doc id="120174" wikidata="Q9954" url="?curid=120174" title="Purmerend">
<text>Purmerend () is a city and municipality in the west of the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland. The city is surrounded by polders, such as the Purmer, Beemster and the Wormer. Purmerend&#x27;s population grew relatively slowly until the 1960s, when it increased from around 10,000 to over 80,000 by 2020. This expansion has turned Purmerend into a commuter town; many inhabitants (14,200 in 2011) work, go to school or spend leisure time in Amsterdam. Purmerend is part of the Randstad, one of the largest conurbations in Europe.

The municipality of Beemster merged into the municipality of Purmerend on 1 January 2022. The extended municipality has a population of about 92,000.

==History==
===Early history===

Purmerend was created out of the small fishing village Purmer, which was situated on the land between the Purmermeer (&quot;Purmer Lake&quot;), the Beemstermeer (&quot;Beemster Lake&quot;) and the Wormermeer (&quot;Wormer Lake&quot;) on the south bank of the river , which used to connect the former Purmermeer and Beemstermeer.

Purmerend was founded by a rich banker and landowner from Amsterdam, Willem Eggert. Count William VI of Holland (&quot;Willem VI van Holland&quot;) gave him permission to build a fortified castle, Slot Purmerstein, in 1410. The castle was completed in 1413. This led to the foundation of the town of Purmerend. The castle was demolished in 1741, after it had fallen into decline. 

In 1434 Purmerend was given city rights and in 1484 “marktrechten”, (the right to organise two “&quot;jaarmarkten&quot;” annual markets and a “&quot;weekmarkt&quot;” weekly market) by Count Jan van Egmond. This meant merchants from outside of Purmerend could sell in the market. Before 1484 only food for its own population could be sold.

===17th century===
By 1500 Purmerend had grown considerably, as can be seen on maps from this period. The town had a rectangular shape and was crossed by two roads: one leading north–south, the other east–west. The draining of the Beemster Lake in 1612 and the Purmer Lake in 1622 resulted in a great loss in fishing grounds to Purmerend. However, the new and fertile soil favoured agriculture and livestock breeding, making Purmerend prosperous again. Purmerend now became the centre of an agricultural region, the produce of which was sold on the markets of Purmerend.

===19th century===
From 1819 till 1824 the Noordhollandsch Kanaal was constructed. It was dug along existing waterways like the Oude Vaart, which connected Purmerend to the IJ opposite Amsterdam, and along canals that connected Purmerend to Alkmaar. On 20 July 1821 the large (Purmerend Lock) was completed just west of the city center.

The Noordhollandsch Kanaal brought increased prosperity to Purmerend. In 1840 the company Brantjes en Comp, trading in wood, was founded. The Firma Dirk Bakker also started to import wood. Meanwhile, Firma Pont from Edam diverted her imports over Purmerend via the river. Ships from Norway, Sweden, Russia and America then started to make direct trips to Purmerend to bring wood. Sometimes 12 of these were present at the same time.

The increased commerce and shipping led to the creation of an industry that catered for ships. In turn Purmerend merchants started to equip whalers. In 1866 the establishment of a tow service with 7 tugboats by Gebroeders Goedkoop was one of the last highlights of this period. By about 1880 this boom period for Purmerend was ending, because the new North Sea Canal diverted traffic elsewhere.

===20th century===
During World War II Purmerend was occupied by German forces on 14 May 1940. After five years of occupation, the city was liberated by Canadian and other allied forces on Wednesday 9 May 1945.

===21st century===
Purmerend was named Kermisstad van Nederland (&quot;Funfair City of the Netherlands&quot;) in 2003. The city is also well known for its cattle market, the so-called &quot;koemarkt&quot; (“cow market”), where cattle are sold and traded, mostly cows and sheep. () After the outbreak of many cattle diseases between 1995 and 2001 the cattle market was closed, but reinstated on a smaller scale in January 2002.

After 400 years in a location in central Purmerender, in 2008 the cattle market was moved to the &quot;Baanstee Oost&quot; industrial area, on the north side of Purmerend. This was done for various reasons, including reduced traffic congestion and more parking space in the city centre, as well as more room for auction grounds and ease of moving trucks at the new site.

==Geography and climate==

===Geography===
Purmerend lies on a swampy and watery area known as Waterland. When the first settlers began cultivating the land, it consisted mostly of turf (&quot;veen&quot;), they dug ditches that run parallel to each other to drain excess water. As a side effect of this process, the land began to sink. This resulted in a never-ending battle against the water, and made agriculture near impossible at the time. It also meant that any structure needed to be built on an artificial Terp or natural hill. This applied to Purmerend which was built on the bank of the river De Where, that linked the former Beemster and Purmer lakes.

===Topography===
===Districts===
Purmerend is made up of the following districts.

The municipality of Purmerend also contains the towns/hamlets of Purmerbuurt and partially the Purmer. (The Purmer is shared with Edam-Volendam and Waterland)

===Climate===
==Public transport==
Public transportation is mainly focused on Amsterdam, with several bus services and a train service via Zaandam.

There are 3 train stations in Purmerend, in the north, centre and south.
These are:
*Purmerend Overwhere (North)
*Purmerend (Centre)
*Purmerend Weidevenne (South)

The bus station in Purmerend is called &quot;Tramplein&quot; (or, Tram Square). Historically, a tram (&quot;&#x27;t Boemeltje&quot;) ran from Amsterdam Centraal to Purmerend, ending at the Tramplein. The end stop retained the name even after the tram service was discontinued.

In 1951 The Ramblers had a hit commemorating the tram service &quot;’t Boemeltje van Purmerend&quot;.

In 2019, the province of North Holland revealed plans to extend the Amsterdam Metro&#x27;s Noord-Zuidlijn from Noord station to Purmerend.

==Local government==
The municipal council of Purmerend consists of 37 seats, which divided as follows in the elections of November 2021:
These were the first elections for the new enlarged municipality that included Beemster. It commenced work on 1 January 2012.

Since 22 September 2022 the mayor of Purmerend has been Ellen van Selm.

<text>Schagen () is a city and municipality in the northwestern Netherlands. It is located between Alkmaar and Den Helder, in the region of West Friesland and the province of North Holland. It received city rights in 1415. In 2013, Schagen merged with the neighbouring municipalities of Zijpe and Harenkarspel, forming a new municipality, also called Schagen. The town hall is located in the main town of Schagen.

It had a population of in and covers an area of .

==History==
===10th–15th centuries===
Schagen has been mentioned in various texts from around 975. One was a population count that found that 43 people lived there. Schagen was also mentioned in documents as Scagha from around 989. At this time Schagen was a center of artificial dwelling hills. The name may refer to Scagha to its location above land water: it could mean &quot;elevated point&quot;. Some time later, there was a coastline near Schagen. When the sea retreated again at the end of the 13th century the places in the region grew. The land around Schagen was especially fertile, so it grew and remained the main town in the area.

In 1415, William VI granted city rights to the town. In 1427, Philip the Good of Burgundy loaned Schagen to his uncle William of Bronckhorst, one of the seven illegitimate children of Albrecht of Bavaria, and Maria van Bronckhorst. Schagen became a fief with some regional rights in addition to its city rights, including some control over the small towns around Schagen. William ordered the castle in which he lived from 1440. In 1460, the church of Schagen, dedicated to St. Christopher, was consecrated. In 1463 Schagen received the right to hold a cattle market and it became a trading town for a wider region.

===16th–19th centuries===
From 1603, an annual horse market was held in Schagen, upon authorization by the States of Holland and Westfriesland.

At the beginning of the Golden Age Schagen underwent very little growth, unlike other cities in the region: Alkmaar, Enkhuizen, Medemblik, and Hoorn. Later in the Golden Age the city benefited from the increased prosperity, but never to the degree these other cities enjoyed. Even after the Golden Age growth was limited. Partly due to the reclamation of the surrounding area, Schagen could flourish economically again in the 19th century. In particular, the cattle market played an important role. When in 1865 the railroad between Alkmaar and Den Helder came into use, the market and home industries flourished. Schagen had about 2060 inhabitants at this time.

In 1894, Schagen was shocked by a double murder, when 17-year-old Klaas Boes murdered his 55-year-old neighbor and her 17-year-old niece. The murder attracted wide national media attention and caused the murderer&#x27;s mother to commit suicide. Newly appointed mayor Simon Berman headed a committee that offered 750 guilders reward, donated by the residents, for information. In 1895, Boes was sentenced to life imprisonment, later changed to 25 years. He was released from prison in 1922 and died in 1956. For years, &quot;Klaas Boes&quot; was used in the Netherlands for youngsters who were up to no good.

===20th–21st centuries===
During the 20th century, prosperity decreased slowly. Especially after the Second World War there was a sharp decline in the agricultural sector. As Schagen did not only depend on agriculture, the decline was less than in surrounding rural communities. Around 1960 Schagen started to flourish again, though population was still below 5,000. The seventies saw a large boom for Schagen. In the early nineties, growth gradually diminished but Schagen remained relatively strong compared to neighboring municipalities.

From 2005 to 2007, Schagen resident Johan Huibers built a ship modeled after the biblical description of Noah&#x27;s Ark in Schagen. Johan&#x27;s Ark was opened to the public in April 2007 and later towed between various port cities in the Netherlands.

==Transportation==
Intercity trains stop at Schagen railway station, providing good connectivity with Den Helder to the North and Alkmaar and Amsterdam to the South. All south-bound trains pass through Amsterdam Centraal, and then continue through Utrecht Centraal either to Eindhoven and Maastricht or to Arnhem and Nijmegen. The journey time to Amsterdam is 51 minutes (Sloterdijk) or 57 minutes (Centraal.)

The railway station is Schagen&#x27;s hub for local and regional bus services.

, three of the five operational vlotbruggen (&quot;float bridges&quot;) are in Schagen: at Burgervlotbrug, at Sint Maartensvlotbrug, and at &#x27;t Zand.

== Politics ==
The municipal council of Schagen consists of 29 seats, which are divided as follows:

<text>Deephaven is a small city in Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States. The community is on Lake Minnetonka, centered on the Cottagewood General Store, which has been serving the Lake Minnetonka area since 1895. Deephaven is west-southwest of downtown Minneapolis. The population was 3,642 as of the 2010 Census, down from 3,853 as of the 2000 census.

==History==
Deephaven was settled in 1876 by Saint Louis attorney Charles Gibson. Gibson built a summer house in an area known as &quot;Northome&quot; and began promoting the area as a vacation destination for Southerners. In 1879 he advocated for the construction of the 150-room Hotel Saint Louis, the area&#x27;s first grand hotel. The community was connected to the Minneapolis and Saint Louis Railway to serve both the hotel and local cottagers.

The Minnetonka Yacht Club was founded in Deephaven in 1882 and incorporated in 1889. One of its co-founders, Hazen Burton, built a home named &quot;Chimo&quot; in Deephaven in 1890. A train depot was built near the property so that the Burtons could commute to their department store in Minneapolis. The name &quot;Deephaven&quot; can be traced back to this depot&#x27;s name.

In 1893 Burton commissioned local boat builder Arthur Dyer to develop a new kind of sailboat called a racing scow. When the &quot;Onawa&quot; debuted in 1893, it was disqualified for winning nearly every regatta it entered. The rules were eventually modified, and racing scows became popular worldwide. The &quot;Onawa&quot; is displayed at the Excelsior-Lake Minnetonka Historical Society Museum in nearby Excelsior.

Lake Minnetonka fell out of favor as a vacation destination in the 1890s. The Hotel Saint Louis suffered financially and was demolished in 1907. In its place, Walter Donald Douglas of the Quaker Oats fortune and his wife Mahala built a 27-room estate named &quot;Walden&quot;. Douglas died in the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster in 1912, but Mahala and her French maid Berthe Leroy survived. Mahala returned to Deephaven as a widow and lived there until her death in 1945.

Deephaven&#x27;s Cottagewood General Store, opened in 1895 by Ralph M. Chapman, served as a grocer to tourists along Lake Minnetonka. The store is one of Deephaven&#x27;s most notable attractions.

==Geography==

<text>Schermer () is a former municipality in the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland. The name comes from &quot;skir mere&quot;, which means &quot;bright lake&quot;. Since 2015 it has been a part of the municipality of Alkmaar.

The municipality of Schermer included not only the Schermer polder, but also the polders of Oterleek, Mijzenpolder and Eilandspolder.

== History ==
Around 800 AD, the area that was the municipality of Schermer was covered in peat, and a small river called the Schermer flowed through it. Because of peat-digging and storm floods, this small river had by 1250 developed into an inland lake with an open connection with the Zuyderzee. In the 17th century private investors started draining the largest part of the lake, leaving the southern part, the Alkmaardermeer, intact. In 1635, of polder was drained, whereupon the land was divided among the shareholders. In 1970, the village of Zuid- en Noord-Schermer was merged into Schermer.

== Population centres ==
The municipality of Schermer included the following small towns and villages: Driehuizen, Grootschermer, Oterleek, Schermerhorn, Stompetoren, Zuidschermer. The latter two are located in the Schermer polder.

===Topography===
&quot;Map of the municipality of Schermer, 2013.&quot;

== Local government ==

The municipal council of Schermer consisted of eleven seats, which were divided as follows at the 2010 local elections:

* Schermer Belang - 4 seats
* CDA - 3 seats
* VVD - 2 seats
* PvdA - 2 seats

There was an election in November 2014 for the council of the new merged Alkmaar municipality that commenced work on 1 January 2015, replacing Schermer council.

==History==


For most of its existence, Eden Prairie was a slow-growing, pastoral village on the far southwest fringes of the Twin Cities. Between 1880 and 1960, Eden Prairie&#x27;s population only grew from about 739 to 2,000.

Native Americans were the first to live in the area. Originally, the land was part of the Great Dakota Nation, but when the Ojibwe arrived from the Great Lakes region, the tribes began to clash over the land. The Ojibwe were armed with knives and guns traded to them by white settlers and fur traders, and after years of bloody warfare the Ojibwe had forced the Dakota to give up all their land east of the Mississippi River, and north of the Crow Wing River, land that did not include what is now Eden Prairie.

In 1853, John H. McKenzie and Minnesota Territory secretary Alexander Wilkins platted the town of Hennepin along the Minnesota River in what is now southeastern Eden Prairie. According to area historian Helen Holden Anderson, topographic disadvantages for the transport of agricultural goods caused Hennepin to be eclipsed by other towns in the region, and the town soon vanished from maps.

On May 25, 1858, a battle was fought between the Dakota and the Ojibwe in the southern part of Eden Prairie, just north of the Minnesota River, an area known as Murphy&#x27;s Ferry. The Ojibwe wished to &quot;avenge the murder&quot; of one of their people by the Dakota the previous fall. The Ojibwe had 200 warriors and the Dakota somewhere between 60 and 70, but the Dakota proved victorious, wounding the young Ojibwe chief.

The tribes continued to fight over territory well into the 1860s, even after the &quot;Sioux Uprising&quot; of 1862, when most Dakota people were removed from Minnesota.

Among the notable Native Americans who lived in the Eden Prairie area was Chief Shoto. Born into the band of Chief Wabash, he went on to be the chief of the Red Wing Dakota tribe for 15 years, leaving them and becoming Chief of the &quot;Little Six&quot; band of Dakota until the uprising in 1862, during which he became a scout for then Governor Sibley from 1862 to 1870, returning to the Little Six band in 1872. He died in 1899 at age 99 at his home in Eden Prairie.

In 1851, a treaty opened land west of the Mississippi River to settlement allowing pioneers to settle in what is now Eden Prairie. Many early farmhouses remain in the town and can be found on the National Register of Historic Places. One of these early settlers was John Cummins, an Irish-born immigrant who built what is now known as the &quot;Cummins-Phipps-Grill House&quot; with his wife Mattie in 1880. Manuscripts indicate that Cummins was an avid and respected horticulturist, scientist, and farmer; he used his farmland to experiment with different strains of apples and grapes to try to find one that could withstand the harsh climate in Minnesota. The Cummins family sold this property to the Phipps family in 1908.

Eden Prairie&#x27;s town board held its first meeting in a log schoolhouse on May 11, 1858, the same day Minnesota became a state. In the 1870s, a post office called Washburn was established in Eden Prairie Township, and would be discontinued in 1903. Also that decade, a depot along the Minneapolis-St. Louis Railroad was constructed near modern Eden Prairie Road and Highway 212. A replica on restricted land was built in 2022 beside the Minnesota River Bluffs LRT Regional Trail.

Eden Prairie&#x27;s farming community grew slowly over the years. Flying Cloud Airport was the first sign of big development in 1946. The 1960s and 1970s were decades of growth for the city&#x27;s parks and recreation system. In the mid-1970s, the community gained a higher profile with the addition of Interstate Highway 494 and the Eden Prairie Center mall. Eden Prairie became a village in 1962 and a statutory city in 1974. One of Eden Prairie&#x27;s popular lakes, Staring Lake, is named for Jonas Platt Staring (1809–1894), who built the first house by the lake.

===Etymology===
The city was originally named &quot;Eden&quot; in 1853 by the writer Elizabeth F. Ellet, who chose the name because of her admiration of the &quot;beautiful prairie&quot; that occupies the southern part of town.

==Geography==
Eden Prairie is about southwest of Minneapolis along the northern side of the Minnesota River.

Interstate 494, U.S. Highways 169 and 212, and Minnesota State Highway 5 are four of the city&#x27;s main routes.

Eden Prairie&#x27;s land consists of rolling hills and bluffs overlooking the Minnesota River, with zones of prairie and mixed (primarily deciduous) forests. Eden Prairie has parks, such as Staring Lake Park and Bryant Lakes Regional Park, with trails for running and biking.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water.

In 2008, Eden Prairie raised roughly $500,000 from the community to build a veterans memorial. The memorial has two components, service to country and world peace. It was constructed in Purgatory Creek Park near the intersection of Technology Drive and Prairie Center Drive. Sculptor Neil Brodin designed and constructed two bronze sculptures. The service-to-country sculpture represents a wounded airman carried over the shoulders of a soldier in the battlefield.

The world-peace sculpture depicts a woman service member touching a globe, honoring women who have served. Community members could purchase a place on the memorial for the names of loved ones who served in any branch of the U.S. service in any war or conflict. Minnesota-based Cold Spring Granite provided Mesabi black granite for the memorial&#x27;s walls.

==In popular culture==
The city&#x27;s regional shopping mall, Eden Prairie Center, stood in for the Mall of America in the 1997 comic mockumentary &quot;Drop Dead Gorgeous&quot;. Two years earlier, the mall served as the principal filming location of Kevin Smith&#x27;s &quot;Mallrats&quot;.

The railroad overpass that lent its name to the 1990 Prince album &quot;Graffiti Bridge&quot; passed over Valley View Road in the city&#x27;s northwestern quadrant. It was torn down in 1991 to make way for an expansion of the road and has since been replaced with a bridge carrying the Minnesota River Bluffs LRT rail-to-trail recreational path. Prince also owned a warehouse on Flying Cloud Drive to rehearse and record music; today, the site is occupied by TGK Automotive.

The cult television show &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; was filmed out of an industrial park in Eden Prairie for much of its original run.

<text>Texel (; Texels dialect: ) is a municipality and an island with a population of 13,643 in North Holland, Netherlands. It is the largest and most populated island of the West Frisian Islands in the Wadden Sea. The island is situated north of Den Helder, northeast of Noorderhaaks, and southwest of Vlieland.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Texel&quot; is Frisian, but because of historical sound-changes in Dutch, where all -x- sounds have been replaced with -s- sounds (compare for instance English &quot;fox&quot;, Frisian &quot;fokse&quot;, German &quot;Fuchs&quot; with Dutch &quot;vos&quot;), the name is typically pronounced &quot;Tessel&quot; in Dutch.

==History==
The All Saints&#x27; Flood (1170) created the islands of Texel and Wieringen from North Holland. In the 13th century Ada, Countess of Holland was held prisoner on Texel by her uncle, William I, Count of Holland.

Texel received city rights in 1415.

The first Dutch expedition to the Northwest Passage departed from the island on the 5th of June, 1594. 

Texel was involved in the Battle of Scheveningen (1653) during the First Anglo-Dutch War and the Battle of Texel (1673) during the Third Anglo-Dutch War.


During the American Revolutionary War, Texel was used as a port by Continental Navy officer John Paul Jones after the battle of Flamborough Head off the Yorkshire coast in September 1779. In the battle, Jones captured the Royal Navy frigate , which he sailed to Texel for desperately needed repairs. This event further complicated Anglo-Dutch relations.

In 1797, Texel was involved in the Battle of Camperdown during the French Revolutionary Wars.

During the First World War in 1914, the Battle off Texel took place off the coast of Texel.

On the night of 31 August 1940, the sea to the northwest of Texel was the scene of the sinking of two Royal Navy destroyers and the severe damage of a third by German mines in what is known as the Texel Disaster.

At the end of the Second World War in 1945, the Georgian uprising on Texel took place on the island. Following a German decision to redeploy Georgian soldiers to the mainland, they revolted and killed hundreds of their German comrades while they slept. The uprising lasted from 5 April 1945 until 20 May 1945, two weeks after V-E Day. At that point, Canadian troops arrived and arranged for the two sides to separately leave the island. For that reason, the uprising is often referred to as the final battle of the Second World War in Europe. Hundreds of Georgians who died fighting against the Germans are buried in a special cemetery on Texel commonly known as the &quot;Russian cemetery&quot;.

== Geography ==
The municipality lies north of the mainland of the province of North Holland and west of the mainland of the province of Friesland. The island of Texel is situated north of the city of Den Helder, northeast of the uninhabited island of Noorderhaaks, which is part of the municipality, and southwest of the island of Vlieland.

The island of Texel was originally made up of two islands, Texel proper to the south and Eierland to the northeast, which were connected by shoals. In the early seventeenth century, the islands were connected by a dyke to keep the North Sea from ravaging the coastal areas of Texel proper. In the mid-nineteenth century a polder completed the northern half of the island. Today, Texel forms the largest natural barrier between the North Sea and the Wadden Sea.

The dune landscape along the western coast of the island is protected as Dunes of Texel National Park.

=== Landscape ===
The island is 23.7 km long and 9.6 km wide, its surface is 162.00 square kilometres. The highest point of the island is the dune &quot;Bertusnol&quot; (also &quot;Nol van Bertus&quot;), which is situated in the Dunes of Texel National Park, at 19.6 m.

The dune landscape on Texel is an important habitat for wildlife. Notable areas include De Slufter, where the tide comes in and meets the dunes, forming a marshy environment rich in both fauna and flora. In winter, birds of prey and geese take up residence. About a third of Texel is a protected nature reserve. A wetland called Utopia has been designed for birds to nest in.

===Climate===
Texel has an oceanic climate (Köppen Cfb) that is heavily influenced by its offshore position. The annual average high oscillation is between and . While winters are similar to mainland areas, summers remain cooler. The relative proximity to the mainland still renders heat bursts to reach Texel with five months having recorded temperatures above . While the island is relatively rainy, the precipitation is generally quite even and moderate throughout most of the year although there is a dry peak in late spring and a rain peak in autumn.

* Dorian van Rijsselberghe (born 1988 in Den Burg), a sailor, gold medallist at the 2012 and 2016 Summer Olympics

== Economy ==
The tourism industry forms a substantial part of the economy in Texel. Approximately 70% of activities on Texel are in some way related to tourism. Popular forms of tourism on Texel include cycling, walking, swimming and horse riding. Farming (sheep, potatoes, dairy, tulips, and grain) and fishing (primarily from Oudeschild) are traditional.

== Local government ==
The municipal council of Texel consists of 15 seats, which are divided as follows (from the most recent election results in 2022:
== Transport ==
Transport around the island is typically by bicycle, bus (Texelhopper) or car. The island has an extensive cycle path network. It is connected to the mainland via a ferry operated by Royal TESO from Den Helder, and by air via Texel International Airport. The ferry Texelstroom uses 80% compressed natural gas.

<doc id="120181" wikidata="Q957763" url="?curid=120181" title="Edina, Minnesota">
<text>Edina ( , ) is a city in Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States and a first-ring suburb of Minneapolis. The population was 53,494 at the 2020 census, making it the 18th most populous city in Minnesota.

Edina began as a small farming and milling community along Minnehaha Creek in the 1860s and became one of Minneapolis&#x27;s first incorporated suburbs in 1888. After years of being a streetcar suburb, Edina saw expanded development as a car-centric suburb in the 1950s and 1960s.

The city is known for its shopping, parks, and high quality of life and also has the nation&#x27;s oldest indoor mall, the Southdale Center.

==History==


===Settlement===
Edina began as part of Richfield Township, Minnesota. By the 1870s, 17 families, most of them immigrating as a result of the Great Famine of Ireland, had come to Minnesota and claimed land in the southwest section of what was then Richfield Township. They were followed by settlers from New England and Germany, who claimed additional land near Minnehaha Creek. The Baird and Grimes neighborhoods (both listed on the National Register of Historic Places) and the Country Club District (then known as Waterville Mills) in northeastern Edina were among the first areas to be established. The area then known as the Cahill Settlement, at West 70th Street and Cahill Road, was also an early community center and the home of Cahill School.

In 1888, the township&#x27;s residents held a meeting to consider founding a new village, thus separating themselves from Richfield Township. The idea was accepted and a committee was established to oversee the transition.

===Naming===
After the decision was made to form a new village, debate ensued about the new village&#x27;s name. Several town meetings were held in the Minnehaha Grange Hall, during which the names Hennepin Park, Westfield, and Edina were suggested. Minutes taken by Henry F. Brown, a farmer and future owner (1889) of the Edina Mill, are summarized as follows:

At the next meeting, the name Edina was chosen with a vote of 47 for and 42 against.

A prevailing myth about the decision to name the new village Edina is that two opposing communities—the Irish Cahill community and the Scottish Mill community—fought about whether to give the community an Irish name (Killarney Lakes) or a Scottish one (Edina). But the 1860 census indicates that there were no Scottish people in Edina in 1860, and only a couple were present at the time of Edina&#x27;s founding (1888).

The name &quot;Edina&quot; may also come from the language of the nearby Dakota tribe. The word &quot;&quot; means &quot;to catch fire.&quot;

===Morningside===

The first suburban development in Edina occurred during the early 1900s in Morningside, a neighborhood in the northeastern part of the village. As Morningside grew, conflict arose between its residents who wanted more city services, and the residents of the rest of the village who wanted to maintain Edina&#x27;s rural character. As a result of that conflict, Morningside seceded from Edina in 1920 and became a separate village. In 1966, however, the Village of Morningside once again became part of Edina.

===Early settlement===
Edina was not the first settlement in its location. According to historian Deborah Morse-Kahn, the Quaker village that existed where Edina would be built included African American families of Civil War veterans and freed slaves &quot;became very involved in community life—especially as farmland owners, civic and cultural leaders.&quot; At the November 1898 general election, J. Frank Wheaton, a Republican African American, was elected to the Minnesota House of Representatives representing District 42, which included all of Edina. Wheaton beat his white Democratic opponent in every Minneapolis city ward and in every village within the legislative district, including Edina, even though the legislative district had only approximately 100 African American residents out of a total of 40,000 residents.

===Early development===
In the early 20th century suburban development brought discriminatory policies that led to nearly all of the African Americans who had been living in Edina to move away.

Historian James W. Loewen described the suburb as a sundown town. Researchers point in particular to Samuel Thorpe&#x27;s development of the Country Club Historic District, which used deed restrictions as means to exclude non-whites, stating explicitly that:

Other developments, like that built by N. P. Dodge Corporation just a mile away, followed suit in attempting to protect land values through racial policies. Though the Supreme Court ruled these kinds of discriminatory housing clauses unenforceable in its &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot; decision of 1948, reports of discrimination persisted through the 1950s and 1960s. According to the Edina Historical Society&#x27;s story about the first black family in Morningside (then a separate village) in 1960, attempts to keep them out included tactics like trying &quot;to get [their] lot condemned for drainage.&quot; In response, then-mayor Ken Joyce wrote a note dismissing the drainage concern and challenging citizens &quot;to live the Golden Rule&quot;. Shortly thereafter the village voted in favor of inclusion.

Jewish residents were also affected by exclusionary deed covenants. In the 1960s, some residents boasted that Edina had &quot;Not one Negro and not one Jew.&quot;

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Residential areas comprise the largest portion of the City, which is now more than 95 percent developed.

Within Edina are many different neighborhoods; Highlands, Indian Hills, Morningside, Country Club District, Cahill Village, Chapel Hill, South Harriet Park, Interlachen, Rolling Green, Presidents, Sunnyslope, White Oaks, Parkwood Knolls, Braemar Hills, Birchcrest, Dewey Hill and Hilldale.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===

&quot;Note: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category. This table excludes Latinos from the racial categories and assigns them to a separate category. Hispanics/Latinos can be of any race.&quot;

===2010 census===
As of the census of 2010, there were 47,941 people, 20,672 households, and 12,918 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 22,560 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 88.1% White, 3.0% African American, 0.2% Native American, 6.1% Asian, 0.7% from other races, and 1.8% from two or more races.

The average household size was 2.31 and the average family size was 2.98.

The median age in the city was 45.2 years. 24.2% of residents were under the age of 18; 4.5% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 21% were from 25 to 44; 29.6% were from 45 to 64; and 20.7% were 65 years of age or older. The gender makeup of the city was 46.6% male and 53.4% female.

According to 2012–2016 estimates, the median household income was $91,847 and per capita income was $65,245. The median value of owner-occupied housing units was $424,500.

===Religion===
* Edina hosts Venkateswara Temple, a Hindu Temple, for the over 40,000 Hindus residing in the Minneapolis-St Paul area.

====Transit====
Before streetcar service was abandoned in 1954, the Twin City Rapid Transit Company&#x27;s Lake Minnetonka Line went through Edina paralleling 44th Street on dedicated right-of-way. After streetcar service was abandoned, the right-of-way was developed as single family housing.

=====Commuter rail=====
The Dan Patch Line and successor Minneapolis, Northfield and Southern Railway operated interurban service through Edina until 1942. Although in poor condition and rated for speeds less than 35 mph, the tracks are still used by freight trains. Under the Dan Patch Corridor proposal, commuter trains would operate between Minneapolis and Northfield with a station in Edina. A feasibility study was conducted in 2000 and found that ridership would be high but there would be a significant cost to upgrade the corridor for commuter trains. Due to this and strong opposition from residents living near the rail line, the proposal was put on hold until other commuter rail lines could be built. In 2002 a legislative gag order was placed on the project, which forbid the Metropolitan Council, MnDOT, and county rail authorities from discussing, studying, and building commuter rail on the Dan Patch Line. In 2017 the Edina City Council conducted a study on the pros and cons of passenger rail on the Dan Patch Line. The conclusion was to not pursue passenger rail at that time (as of 2018). The legislativ gag order was repealed by the Minnesota Legislature on May 21, 2023.

=== Topography ===
&quot;Map of the municipality of Uitgeest, June 2015&quot;

== Local government ==
The municipal council of Uitgeest consists of 15 seats, which at the 2022 municipal elections divided as follows:

== Tourist information ==
No fewer than five windmills can be seen in the polder landscape surrounding the village. Uitgeest was the birthplace (in 1550) of Cornelis Corneliszoon, inventor of the wind-powered sawmill. An industrial heritage park, centered on sawmill De Hoop, is under construction.

The village has a Reformed church dating back to the early 14th Century and lakeside marina. The 670m outdoor kart-racing track made room for new housing, so this tourist attraction was lost. Fort along Den Ham (between Uitgeest and Krommenie) was one of the 42 forts of the Stelling van Amsterdam, a 19th-century ring of fortifications around Amsterdam which has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The fort is now a museum open to the public on Sundays.

==Transportation==

*Railway station: Uitgeest

Uitgeest is served by 4 trains per hour (Monday – Saturday), journey time to Amsterdam is around 20 minutes. The Stoptrein via Beverwijk and Haarlem is slower, while the journey via Zaandam passes through beautiful countryside.

*Highway
Uitgeest is very close to the highways N8/A8 and A9. This will take you to Amsterdam in around 15 minutes. In 2010 two lanes (&#x27;spitsstroken&#x27;) were added to the A9, improving the traffic to and from the Amsterdam region.

* Cornelis Corneliszoon van Uitgeest (ca.1550–ca.1600) a Dutch windmill owner who invented the wind-powered sawmill
* Willem Blaeu (1571–1638) a Dutch cartographer, atlas maker and publisher

<text>Uithoorn () is a municipality and a town in the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland.

== Population centres ==
The municipality of Uithoorn includes the town of Uithoorn and the village of De Kwakel.

== History ==
The name &quot;De Uithoorn&quot; (or &quot;De Uythoorn&quot;) was used at the end of the Middle Ages for the location of the lower courts of the deanery of Saint John. The village formed around its courthouse.

People depended on agriculture and animal husbandry. Agriculture became increasingly more difficult due to the steady soil subsidence. From c. 1600 on, peat extraction became important and resulted in the formation of large ponds, which in turn would be made into polders later on.

During the Franco-Dutch War in the &quot;disaster year&quot; of 1672, Uithoorn was on the front lines and fortifications were built.

During the Batavian Republic period, the neighbouring village of Thamen was merged with Uithoorn. Its economy was limited, but improved in the middle of the 19th century when some industries (including chemical) were established in the area. The reclamation of a few large ponds provided extra agricultural land at the end of the same century.

A sulphuric acid plant was established on the banks of the Amstel in 1863, it closed in the early 1900s; in 1922 the site was used for a coal tar processor, &quot;Teerbedrijf Uithoorn&quot;, later known as Cindu Chemicals. A subsidiary company Nevcin Polymers also operated on the site: both companies were major employers in the town, and also polluters of the air and water bodies. In 1992 a reactor at the Nevcin site exploded, causing three deaths and several injuries. As of 2012 both plants remain in operation.
In circa 1885, several fortifications were built around Uithoorn as part of the Stelling van Amsterdam.

In 1915, the Bovenkerk – Uithoorn line of the former Haarlemmermeer railway lines reached Uithoorn, near the village centre on the Amstel. Passenger service would end in 1950 and freight service in 1972. Most of the line was scrapped by 1987. The former Uithoorn railway station still stands. Later a busway would be built on part of the abandoned right-of-way. Tram line 25 (dubbed the Amsteltram) would be extended along the right-of-way opening in 2024.

After World War II, Uithoorn developed quickly: in 1948 the Thamerdal neighbourhood was built, followed by Zijdelwaard in 1960, Legmeer in 1972, Meerwijk-West and Meerwijk-Oost from 1985 on. In 1991 a new shopping centre was built in the town centre, at the expense of many original buildings.

== Local government ==
The municipal council of Uithoorn consists of 23 seats, which at the 2022 municipal election divided as follows:
== Notable people ==

<text>Excelsior ( ) is a city in Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States. Excelsior&#x27;s historic commercial district along Water Street is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the town has many Victorian-era houses. On Lake Minnetonka&#x27;s southern shore, the community serves as a local tourism destination for shoppers, boaters, and restaurant-goers.

Considered a western suburb of the Twin Cities, Excelsior is about southwest of downtown Minneapolis. Its population was 2,414 as of the 2020 census. Excelsior&#x27;s major roadway is Minnesota State Highway 7.

==History==
The first Euro-Americans known to have visited Lake Minnetonka were two teenage boys, Joe Brown and Will Snelling, who canoed up Minnehaha Creek from Fort Saint Anthony in 1822.

Minnesota&#x27;s territorial governor Alexander Ramsey officially named Lake Minnetonka in 1852. He had been informed that the Dakota called the lake &quot;Mní iá Tháŋka&quot; (&quot;the-water-they-speak-of-is-large&quot;). The next year, a group of settlers from New York established Excelsior, the lake&#x27;s first white settlement. The former Excelsior Township was named after the hamlet. 

During the late 19th century, the Excelsior and Lake Minnetonka area was home to several popular summer lake resorts.

Streetcars were used in Excelsior as a part of the Twin City Rapid Transit Company system until 1932, when the line was cut back to Hopkins.

===20th century===
A large ballroom called &quot;Danceland&quot; (later &quot;Big Reggie&#x27;s Danceland&quot;) stood across the street from Excelsior Amusement Park from the mid-1920s to 1973. Operated by Ray Colihan, it hosted performances by Lawrence Welk, Fred Waring, and the Andrews Sisters in the 1930s. On May 3, 1963, the Beach Boys performed at Danceland. Beach Boys singer Mike Love remembered the performance as a significant moment for the band in a 2019 interview. According to Love, people &quot;were breaking the windows to get into [Danceland] because it was sold out... I said to one of my bandmates: &#x27;This must be like when Elvis was starting out.&#x27;&quot; On June 12, 1964, The Rolling Stones played Danceland for an audience of 283. It has been speculated that Excelsior resident Jimmy Hutmaker inspired Mick Jagger to write the 1969 song &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot; after a chance encounter at a local drugstore earlier that day, but this claim has long been disputed.

In 1974 President Gerald Ford purchased a golden retriever named Liberty from Excelsior resident Avis Friberg.

===21st century===
Over the years, Excelsior&#x27;s downtown historic district has been home to many businesses, including hotels, restaurants, and merchants. Since 2010, restaurants and eateries have come to dominate the town&#x27;s commercial landscape. Excelsior is known for maintaining its historical identity. Beyond the downtown district, it also retains much of its Victorian-era housing stock. Strict building codes are enforced in order to preserve this identity.

The Excelsior Commons and Lake Minnetonka are central amenities to the community and major draws for tourists. The Minnesota Streetcar Museum, a local transportation museum, maintains a heritage streetcar line in Excelsior and operates three restored streetcars on the line: Twin City Lines No. 1239, Winona Power &amp; Light Co. #10, and Duluth Street Railway No. 78.

<text>Weesp () is a city and an urban area in the municipality of Amsterdam in the province of North Holland, Netherlands. It had a population of in . It lies on the river Vecht and next to the Amsterdam–Rhine Canal in an area called the Vechtstreek. The former municipality of Weesp merged with Amsterdam on 24 March 2022.

== History ==

Until the early Middle Ages the region around Weesp was an uninhabited peat bog. Weesp (Wesopa in Latin documents) was granted city rights in 1355 and celebrated its 650th anniversary as a city in 2005.

From the late Middle Ages, the river Vecht was a defensive line for the County of Holland and it remained a military defensive line until the Second World War. Weesp was strongly fortified, more than its size would justify; for most of its history it had a few thousand inhabitants.

The defensive lines consisted of inundation zones, which would be flooded in wartime (the Hollandic Water Line). Behind them were fortified towns, forts, barracks and other military structures. The most comprehensive was the Defence Line of Amsterdam (Stelling van Amsterdam), a circular inundation zone around Amsterdam, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

After the Second World War, new housing was built in the west and an industrial zone with a harbour at the Amsterdam-Rhine Canal was constructed. In the 1970s a suburb was built on the south. Another suburb was built in the north which recently expanded with plans for further expansion.

Before the reformation the church was dedicated to Saint Lawrence. It is still in use for Protestant services. In the tower it has a famous carillon by Pieter Hemony cast in 1671. Following the 19th Century emancipation of Dutch Catholics, a Catholic church was erected in Weesp.

The Dutch government considered Weesp too small to continue as an independent municipality. In a 2018 referendum, 57.4% of the inhabitants voted in favor of a merger with Amsterdam. On 1 June 2019 the civil service offices of the municipality of Weesp merged with those of the municipality of Amsterdam in preparation of the merger of the two municipalities. Bas Jan van Bochove was the last mayor of the municipality of Weesp until the merger was finalized on 24 March 2022.

== Population centres ==
The municipality of Weesp consisted of three towns: De Horn, Uitermeer, and Weesp. The north of the city of Weesp is known for its Hogewey dementia village.

== Economy ==

The first Dutch porcelain originated in Weesp and dates to 1759. The venture was led by Bertrand Philip, Count of Gronsveld.
The most famed product of Weesp is Van Houten chocolate. Before cocoa production, the local economy had been based on beer breweries, jenever distilleries, production of Weesper porcelain, and trade, due to its location on a branch point of waterways. In the 21st century, the economy is very diverse.

There were large facilities of Solvay Pharmaceuticals, until February 2010 when Abbott Laboratories of North Chicago, Illinois acquired Solvay Pharmaceuticals. At this site there is a chemical plant which manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredient for Abbott brands Duphalac and Duphaston and a biologic plant which manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredient for Abbott&#x27;s flu vaccine Influvac. The local specialty is the Weesper Mop cookie, which is based on mashed almond.

== Tourism ==
Weesp is a popular stop for tourists. It has a protected historical center with canals and many buildings dating from the seventeenth and eighteenth century. Weesp has three full-size historical windmills. It features a bastion and fortifications that are part of the Defense line of Amsterdam and the Dutch Water Line. These structures have never been attacked, though. The scenic river Vecht and the small roads that line it attract yachters and cyclists. The Naardermeer area, the first nature reserve in the Netherlands, is at 15 minutes cycling distance from Weesp; it protects the Gooi landscape. The Weesp local museum is located in the former city hall.

== Urban area government ==
The seats in the Weesp administrative committee elected on 16 March 2022 for four years are divided between the political parties as follows :
== Transport ==
Weesp has one railway station, Weesp. It serves as a transfer station for passengers on local trains on the Amsterdam–Amersfoort (&quot;Oosterspoorweg&quot;) and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol–Almere (&quot;Schiphollijn&quot; and &quot;Flevolijn&quot;) lines, which bundle up just before Weesp and diverge right after. Weesp therefore benefits from 16 departures per hour, serving many destinations including Amsterdam Centraal, Schiphol Airport, Hilversum, Amersfoort Centraal and Utrecht Centraal four times per hour.

In front of the railway station there is a small bus station with services to neighbouring towns and villages such as Muiden, Muiderberg, and Nigtevecht and to Amsterdam Bijlmer ArenA station.

<text>Wervershoof (; West Frisian: &quot;Werfershouf&quot;) is a small town and former municipality in the north-western Netherlands, in the province of North Holland and the region of West-Frisia. Since 1 January 2011 it has been part of the municipality of Medemblik. The and N302 roads run through the town. 

There are a number of versions of the origin of the name Wervershoof. It may come from the preacher Werenfridus, a follower of Willibrord who came to the area in 690 and later lived on a farm there. The old parish church was dedicated to St. Werenfridus. A settlement named &#x27;Werfaertshof&#x27; is mentioned on a map in 1288. 

Until the early 19th century, the population fluctuated between 250 and 400. The number grew after 1817 when it became an independent municipality and in 1868 there were nearly 800 inhabitants. The municipality was then enlarged by adding High and Low Zwaagdijk, after which it had about 1,600 inhabitants. After slow growth in the early 20th century, the population grew more rapidly after World War II, increasing from 2,000 to just over 5,000 over a 40-year period. The other places in the municipality grew more slowly than Wervershoof. On 1 January 2010, the town had 8,794 inhabitants. 

== Local government ==
The last municipal council of Wervershoof consisted of 13 seats, which at the 2006 election, were divided as follows:
* Algemene Belangen Combinatie (ABC) - 3 seats
* Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) - 2 seats
* Progressief Wervershoof (PW) - 2 seats
* People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) - 2 seats
* Zwaagdijker Dorpsbelang - 2 seats
* Labour Party (PvdA) - 2 seats
An election was held in November 2010 for a council for the new Medemblik municipality that merged Medemblik with both Wervershoof and Andijk. This commenced work on 1 January 2011. The last mayor of the Wervershoof municipality was Floris Vletter (VVD).

== Notable people born in Wervershoof ==
* Jelle and Dion Bakker (1983 and 1981), creator of Jelle&#x27;s Marble Runs YouTube channel
* Yvonne Spigt (1988), skater, Dutch champion marathon skating on natural ice 2008 and 2012

<doc id="120194" wikidata="Q669547" url="?curid=120194" title="Wieringen">
<text>Wieringen () is located in the province of North Holland in the Netherlands. Now a part of the municipality of Hollands Kroon, it was a separate municipality before 2012. Its name first appeared in 8th and 9th century records. By 1200 it was an island, also named Wieringen, separated from the mainland during one of the severe storm floods in the late Middle Ages that changed the coastline. Through the usage of draining, dikes, and landfill from 1924 to 1932, the island was rejoined to the mainland.

In 2003 the provincial and local governments announced a project to restore Wieringen as an island by creating a recreational lake to be called the Wieringerrandmeer. The project was cancelled in 2010 for financial reasons.

==Population centres==
The former municipality of Wieringen consisted of the following villages and hamlets: Dam, De Elft, De Haukes, De Hoelm, Den Oever, Hippolytushoef, Hollebalg, Noordburen, Oosterklief, Oosterland, Smerp, Stroe, Vatrop, Westerklief and Westerland.

== History ==
The landscape of Wieringen is not all flat: it is characterised by boulder clay mounds, formed during the Saale Ice Age. The name Wieringen probably comes from Old Frisian &quot;wîr&quot; meaning &quot;height&quot;. It was previously suggested incorrectly that the name came from &quot;wier&quot; (seaweed in Dutch).

=== Early references ===
The first known written references to Wieringen are as &quot;Wiron&quot; or &quot;pagus Wirense&quot; in Latin lists of property owned by the monastery at Fulda, dated late 8th century or early 9th century AD. In this list, the Marsdiep (the channel between Wieringen and Texel and the mainland) is referred to as &quot;fluvium Maresdeop&quot; (&quot;fluvium&quot; is Latin for &quot;river&quot; and Maresdeop is old Dutch for &quot;morass deep&quot;), and Wieringen and Texel may have met as opposite banks of this deep river. It appears that at that time Texel and Wieringen islands were much larger and spread across what is now the western end of the Waddenzee and perhaps also other areas which are now sea or in polders.

A possessions list of the St. Martin&#x27;s church in Utrecht, dated 948, lists a church domain with 12 farms at &quot;Alvitlo&quot; (now De Elft), and 72 [probably mostly small] farms at &quot;Strude&quot; (now Stroe). Both these places are in Wieringen. The land in these lists comprise an area larger than the modern (up to 1924) island of Wieringen.

=== Later history ===
Viking attacks and occupation of Frisian territory took place in the 9th century. This was confirmed in 1996 when a hoard containing 1.7 kilograms of silver coins, ingots and jewelry was found in a pasture at the hamlet of Westerklief. It was dated to the 9th century and is attributed to Vikings. It is now in the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden in Leiden. Smaller hoards from the same period were later found in the same area.

The All Saints&#x27; Flood (1170) created the islands of Wieringen and Texel from North Holland. The area was inhabited and controlled by Frisians, until the Dutch count Floris III made the Wieringers subject in 1184. After this the area became unsettled, with Floris V imposing his rule in 1284, and in 1299 it was included in the district of Westfriesland within the County of Holland. 

In 1432 all the island of Wieringen was officially designated as one township and received city rights. But as more of Holland and Westfriesland became habitable and were developed, the importance of Wieringen decreased.


In 1798 when the Batavian Republic formed, the province of Holland and West Friesland was divided, and Wieringen fell under the département of Texel (from the Vlie to the Rhine). In 1807 under Napoleon, the province was subdivided into two separate provinces; Amstelland and Maasland, but this organization ended in 1814. In 1815 Wieringen became a part of the province of Holland, and the new province of North Holland in 1840, where it still remains.

In November 1918 the German crown prince Wilhelm received political asylum in the Netherlands. He lived in Wieringen from November 1918, returning to Germany in November 1923.

On 31 July 1924 the Amsteldiep was closed by a short dam called the Amsteldiepdijk. In 1930 the Eastern Wieringermeerdijk was completed in the Zuiderzee, and with it the adjacent polder the Wieringermeer. The closing of the Zuiderzee was completed in 1932 by the Afsluitdijk, a large dike which connects Wieringen with Friesland, making it part of the mainland again. This dike starts at Den Oever.

== Local government ==
The former municipal council of Wieringen consisted of 13 seats, which at the final election in 2010 divided as follows: 
* VVD – 5 seats
* Wieringen 05 – 4 seats
* PvdA – 3 seats
* CDA – 1 seat
Elections were held in November 2011 for a council for the new merged municipality of Hollands Kroon that included Wieringen, which commenced work in January 2012.

<doc id="120195" wikidata="Q1902772" url="?curid=120195" title="Hassan Township, Hennepin County, Minnesota">
<text>Hassan Township was an urban township in Hennepin County, Minnesota, United States. Located in the northwestern corner of the county, it was the last remaining township in the county. The population was 2,600 at the 2010 census.

The town began incorporation proceedings in 2003 but abandoned its petition and chose to sign a Joint Powers agreement with the nearby city of Rogers to annex the entirety of Hassan Township. The Hassan Town Board approved annexation in June 2008 with orderly annexation to begin in 2012.

The origin of the name comes from the Dakota word &quot;chanhasen&quot; meaning the &quot;sugar-maple tree&quot; (&quot;chan&quot;, tree; &quot;haza&quot;, a tree with sap). Since the then-township of Chanhassen had established two years before Hassan, the &quot;chan&quot; syllable was dropped to avoid confusion.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau as of its 2000 census, the township had a total area of , of which is land and , or 4.32%, is water. The township completely encircled the city of Rogers. County Roads 81, 116, and 144 were three of the main routes in the township.

By the 2010 census, the area of the township had declined to , as portions of the township had already been annexed by Rogers.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 2,463 people, 778 households, and 689 families residing in the township. The population density was . There were 788 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the township was 98.38% White, 0.32% African American, 0.32% Asian, 0.16% from other races, and 0.81% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.41% of the population.

There were 778 households, out of which 48.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 81.4% were married couples living together, 4.1% had a female householder with no husband present, and 11.4% were non-families. 8.1% of all households were made up of individuals, and 2.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.17 and the average family size was 3.36.

In the township the population was spread out, with 32.9% under the age of 18, 5.7% from 18 to 24, 32.5% from 25 to 44, 24.5% from 45 to 64, and 4.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 36 years. For every 100 females, there were 102.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 103.6 males.

The median income for a household in the township was $79,158, and the median income for a family was $81,832. Males had a median income of $46,689 versus $35,313 for females. The per capita income for the township was $27,350. None of the families and 0.3% of the population were living below the poverty line, including no under eighteens and none of those over 64.

==History==
At the time of it annexation into Rogers, Hassan was the sole remaining township in Hennepin County. The Town of Hassan was classified as an Urban Township which provided for the exercising of more powers than non-urban townships.

Hassan was located along the south bank of the Crow River and bisected by Interstate 94, approximately northwest of downtown Minneapolis. The City of Rogers lay entirely within the original township. Hassan&#x27;s rolling landscape was composed of farmsteads, cultivated fields, scattered homes and subdivisions separated by wetlands, woodlands, and drainageways.

Settlement in 1854 by European immigrants brought about major changes in the landscape of what is now Hassan Township. Originally, as part of the &quot;Big Woods&quot;, the areas was heavily timbered with oak, elm, basswood, ash, and maple. Large areas of marshland also existed. As settlers arrived, the woods were cleared and the land was tilled for farmstead construction and crop production.

Early on, small trade centers, known as hamlets, emerged in Hassan Township to serve the needs of the settlers. The hamlet of Hassan was first settled in 1854 and then organized in 1860 along Territorial Road in Section 21. Between 1854 and 1881, Hassan contained a clustering of houses, a post office, St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, a school and a town hall. Today, an altered school, a church and town hall remain. Today, a few businesses still thrive in Hassan, including Hassan Sand and Gravel, Minuteman Services, and Town and Country Landscaping, among others.

Although not the earliest settlement, Fletcher, originally named St. Walburga by German immigrants, has become the most notable. It stands at the intersection of Territorial Road and County Road 116 (Fletcher Lane) in Hassan Township. Fletcher is considered to be the &quot;finest example of a traditional crossroads hamlet in Hennepin County&quot; and is eligible to become a historic district by the Minnesota Historical Society.

Territorial Road crosses over a series of ridges, including a section that includes the highest point in Hennepin County. It was authorized by the Territorial Legislature in 1855 and identified as the &quot;first legitimate outlet&quot; for this section of Hennepin County. Through the years, it became a major transportation route for Hassan Township and surrounding communities &quot;because it was maintained and it provided relatively easy access to Minneapolis markets.&quot; (Hennepin History Museum; 1995).

<text>Wieringermeer () is a polder and former municipality in the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland. Since 2012 Wieringermeer has been a part of the new municipality of Hollands Kroon.

== Population centres ==

The former municipality of Wieringermeer consisted of the following small towns and villages: Kreileroord, Middenmeer, Slootdorp, Wieringerwerf.

== History ==
Around the year 1000 AD, this area was land. However, several storms after 1100 turned it into a flood plain. Wieringmeer means &quot;Wieringen Lake&quot;, the name of an inland lake that filled the area in the early medieval period.

The Wieringmeerpolder is a polder, newly created land, and part of the Zuiderzee Works developed in the 20th century. Originally the polder was planned after the completion of the Afsluitdijk, but a severe lack of agricultural land meant construction was accelerated, starting in 1927. The dikes had to be strong enough to withstand the force of the Zuiderzee, a sea. Draining of the polder was finished on 21 August 1930. After the completion of the Afsluitdijk in 1932, the lake IJsselmeer was formed from the waters. 

After desalinization, the new land became usable in 1934. Four villages (Slootdorp (1931), Middenmeer (1933), Wieringerwerf (1936) and Kreileroord (1957)), were developed in the polder.

Since 1 July 1941, the Wieringermeer had been an independent municipality. 

On 17 April 1945, during the Second World War, the German occupiers ordered the dike of the Wieringermeer to be blown up: the area was inundated. No one was killed as the polder slowly submerged again (the inhabitants had been warned), but the high water and a subsequent storm destroyed most of the infrastructure built in the previous decade. The floodwater was fresh water, so the land did not have to be desalinated again. Reconstruction followed quickly; by the end of 1945, the polder was declared drained again. Rebuilding of roads and bridges, houses and farms, was greatly facilitated by the experience of building them the first time.

== Local government ==
The former municipal council of Wieringermeer consisted of 15 seats, which at the final election in 2010 divided as follows: 
* CDA - 3 seats
* VVD - 3 seats
* Progressief Wieringermeer - 2 seats
* Onafhankelijk Wieringermeer &#x27;04 - 2 seats
* Gemeente Belangen Wieringermeer - 2 seats
* PvdA - 2 seats
* Christian Union - 1 seat
Elections were held in November 2011 for a council for the new merged municipality of Hollands Kroon that included Wieringermeer, which commenced work in January 2012.

==Government==

===City charter===
Hopkins’ government structure is set by its city charter. Hennepin County district court judges appointed the first Hopkins Charter Commission on February 8, 1946, in order to create a proposed charter that would be voted on. The commission submitted the proposed charter to the Village Council on November 4, 1947. Voters approved the charter December 2, 1947. The charter has been amended numerous times since then, most recently in October 2012.

===Government structure===
The charter specifies that Hopkins use a council-manager plan. The council controls city administration but does so exclusively through the city manager. The charter contains an “interference with administration” clause that expressly forbids the council from telling the city manager whom to hire or preventing the city manager from using his or her judgment to make administrative appointments. It also prohibits the council from issuing orders to any of the city manager&#x27;s subordinates.

====Mayor and council====
The council is made up of the mayor and four council members elected at-large. The mayor serves a two-year term in office. Council members have four-year terms—with two of the seats on the ballot in one election and the other two seats up in the following election. Regular elections take place in odd years.

The mayor votes on all motions before the council like the council members. The position is also the head of the city for ceremonial purposes, serving legal processes and martial law.

The mayor is paid $6,000 per year and council members are paid $4,600 per year. The current salaries were set in 1998.

=====Presidents and mayors=====

Source:

====City manager====
The city manager is the chief administrator of the City of Hopkins. The Hopkins City Council appoints the city manager for an indefinite period and may remove the manager at any time.
====Subordinate employees====
The charter specifies just two other administrative positions by name. It requires the city to have a clerk, who is subordinate to the city manager, and allows for, but doesn&#x27;t require, a city attorney to advise the council on legal matters.

However, the charter specifies that the city manager can create city departments and divisions and alter them when necessary. Hopkins has seven departments, each with a department head that reports to the city manager. The departments are:
* Administration
* Community Services (Assessing, City Clerk, Inspections)
* Finance
* Fire
* Planning &amp; Economic Development
* Police
* Public Works 
* Recreation (operated jointly with Minnetonka, Minnesota)

===Electoral politics===


==History==

The first non-indigenous settlers in the Hopkins area arrived in 1852 as land around the growing Minneapolis–Saint Paul area was opening up and being explored by members stationed at Fort Snelling. However, the roots of the town begin in 1887 with the building of the Minneapolis Threshing Machine Company, later called Minneapolis-Moline, to make farm equipment. At the time, Minneapolis Moline employed most of the Hopkins residents. In 1887, the West Minneapolis Land Company was founded and formed to build housing for the Minneapolis Moline factory workers.

In 1893, residents of Hopkins sent the Hennepin County Board of Commissioners a petition signed by 41 residents, asking that a separate village be formed from unincorporated portions of then-Minnetonka and Richfield Townships. Following an election, the community was then incorporated as the Village of West Minneapolis with a population of 1,105. The original village consisted of about three-square miles, and it has been enlarged by annexation to its present size of about four-square miles.

In 1928, the name of the village was changed to Hopkins after Harley H. Hopkins, who was among its first homesteaders and was the community&#x27;s first postmaster. Mr. Hopkins allowed the town to build the train depot on his land (now The Depot Coffee House) with the agreement that the train station would say &quot;Hopkins&quot; on it. People getting off the train assumed the name of the town was Hopkins and it stuck. On January 1, 1948, the village became the city of Hopkins, upon adoption of a council–city manager charter.

Hopkins was the headquarters of Minneapolis-Moline, which was a large manufacturer of tractors and agricultural equipment in the United States until the 1960s.

===Hopkins Raspberry Festival===
The Hopkins Raspberry Festival is an annual event in Hopkins. The Hopkins Raspberry Festival was founded in 1935 as a way to boost business during the Great Depression of the 1930s. A date of July 21 was chosen to hold the event to coincide with the peak of raspberry-picking season. The festival now takes place the third weekend in July every year.

The Raspberry Festival is overseen by a board of directors supported by many additional volunteers and local civic organizations each year. Since its inception, it has evolved into a dynamic community celebration with activities including music, sporting events, royalty coronations, craft fair, and parade.

===National Register of Historic Places===
The main street of Hopkins, from 8th to 11th avenues, was officially listed on the National Register of Historic Places in January 2022 as the Hopkins Commercial Historic District. The designation was revealed during a ceremony in April 2022.

==Education==

===Public schools===
The Hopkins School District serves all or parts of seven Minneapolis west suburban communities: Hopkins, Minnetonka, Golden Valley, Plymouth, Edina, Eden Prairie, and Saint Louis Park. Approximately 8,100 students attend seven elementary schools (K–fifth grade), two middle schools (6th–8th grade), and one high school (9th–12th grade). Some students attend public schools in other school districts chosen by their families under Minnesota&#x27;s open enrollment statute, as some students from outside Hopkins school district enroll in Hopkins schools on that basis.

<doc id="120199" wikidata="Q117752" url="?curid=120199" title="Wognum">
<text>Wognum () is a former municipality and a town in the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland. Wognum received city rights in 1392 but lost them in 1426. In 2007 it merged with the municipalities of Medemblik and Noorder-Koggenland into an enlarged municipality of Medemblik.

== Population centres ==
The former municipality of Wognum included the towns and villages of Nibbixwoud, Wognum and Zwaagdijk-West, and the hamlet of Wijzend.

==History==
Wognum was formed around 900, confirmed by archaeological finds. In addition, there is evidence that the area was already inhabited around the Bronze Age. Hand axes and arrowheads from that period were found in the area between the current streets of Oosterwijzend and Dorpsstraat in Wognum.

In 980 the city was first mentioned in a church list of the Abbey of Echternach, when the place was named Wokgunge. In a charter of 1063 it was called Woggunghem. There was a chapel, belonging to the Abbey of Heiloo, on the site of the Reformed Church of Wognum. Later spellings included Wognem (1083), Woghenem (1156) and Woggenum (1544). The name could refer to the place of the person or family Wok or Wokke. In addition to the West Frisian names Woggem and Woggelum the name was sometimes even (incorrectly) written Wochnum, analogous to Wochmar and the old Dutch Wochmeer (Wogmeer).

Wognum is located on the shore of an ancient stream. The shore is composed of sandy soil. Just outside the residential center it is located between Oude Gouw - Kerkstraat and the old peat streams at Baarsdorpermeer/Lekermeer. This is a remnant of the reclamation period from the early Middle Ages. This includes the Kromme Leek, a stream that starts at the Baarsdorpermeer meandering along Wognum through Zwaagdijk, and ends at Medemblik. The winding course is preserved as much as possible at the time of the later land consolidation between Wognum and Medemblik.

In the 15th century, fishing was the main source of income. In the 17th century Wognum greatly benefited from the shipping industry of the nearby city of Hoorn. Despite the fact that Wognum had an agricultural character in the 19th century, when in 1979 a new coat of arms for the newly amalgamated municipality of Wognum was created, the three basses from the amalgamated municipality of Nibixwoud appeared on the coat of arms.

In both Wognum and Nibbixwoud there are thousands of fruit trees. Fruit is an important part of the agricultural sector. The layout of Wognum is a combination of agricultural buildings and more urban development in the center.

==Museum / Railway connections==
Wognum is one of the stops of the Hoorn–Medemblik heritage railway.

== Local government ==
The former municipal council of Wognum consisted of 13 seats, which at the final local election in 2002 were divided as follows:
* CDA - 6 seats
* D66 - 3 seats
* PvdA - 2 seats
* VVD - 2 seats

Wognum became a part of the new merged Medemblik municipality on 1 January 2007.

== People from Wognum ==
* John Appel (filmmaker)
* Cor Bakker, pianist
* Frans van Buchem, physician 
* Edith van Dijk, swimmer
* Jeroen Tesselaar, footballer

It is bordered by coastal dunes of Zuid-Kennemerland National Park and the Amsterdam water supply dunes. It hosts the country&#x27;s most prominent motor racing circuit, Circuit Zandvoort. It was named after John Zandvoort, responsible for the construction of the Zandvoort race track. 

The municipality of extends to take in Bentveld; it had a population of 16,954 in 2017. A nudist bathing section of the beach begins about 2 km to the south, with six eateries, which extends kilometers further.

==History==


Zandvoort is known to exist in 1100, called &quot;Sandevoerde&quot; (a combination of &quot;sand&quot; and &quot;voorde&quot;, meaning ford; compare English &quot;Sandford&quot;). Until 1722 the area was under the control of the Lords of Brederode. The village was dependent on fishing for many centuries until the 19th century when it started to transform itself into a seaside resort, following the pattern set by similar towns in the United Kingdom. In 1828 the first resort was inaugurated. Thereafter many notable persons would visit Zandvoort, including Elisabeth of Bavaria in 1884 and 1885. In the middle of the same century, potato cultivation started in the dunes.

In 1881 the railway station near the coast opened, followed by tram connection to Haarlem in 1899, which greatly increased the beach tourism. In 1905 one of the earliest Dutch fictional films was shot in the town, &quot;De mésaventure van een Fransch heertje zonder pantalon aan het strand te Zandvoort&quot;. During World War II, Zandvoort was heavily damaged. On May 23, 1942, beach access was no longer permitted and several months later the town was almost completely vacated. Resorts and avenues were demolished to make way for the coastal fortifications of the Atlantic Wall.

After the war, the town&#x27;s growth accelerated, matching the growth in tourism. In 1948, Circuit Zandvoort was built, hosting the Dutch Grand Prix for several decades, until 1985. The Dutch GP returned in 2021, in the 2021 Formula One World Championship. Zandvoort continues to be a major Dutch resort location, where nearly half of all employment is related to tourism. The Dutch singer Willem Duyn&#x27;s &quot;De Eerste Trein Naar Zandvoort&quot; (&quot;First train to Zandvoort&quot;), modeled on the American song Chattanooga Choo Choo and chronicling chaos and mayhem on the first seaside train, was a hit in the summer of 1983.
