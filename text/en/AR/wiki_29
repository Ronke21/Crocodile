<text>Big Rapids is a city and the seat of government of Mecosta County, Michigan, United States. The population was 7,727 at the 2020 census, down from 10,601 in 2010. The city is surrounded by Big Rapids Charter Township but they are completely separate jurisdictions. Big Rapids is home of the main campus of Ferris State University, a four-year public university.

==History==
Big Rapids was settled in 1855 by brothers George and Zera French. As the village of Leonard, at the intersection of Elm and Stewart streets, it became the seat of Mecosta County on February 11, 1859, but local lumbermen knew the site as Big Rapids. On September 29, 1859, the Leonard post office was renamed Big Rapids. Big Rapids was platted on November 3, 1859, surrounding the courthouse site of Leonard. The unincorporated community of Big Rapids was first cited on June 10, 1861, rather than Leonard, when the Mecosta County board of supervisors mentioned their seat of government, and in 1865 was consistently cited throughout the year. Big Rapids was incorporated as a city in 1869.

==Geography==

<text>Big Rapids Township is a charter township of Mecosta County in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 census, the township population was 3,917.

The city of Big Rapids is surrounded by the charter township but, like all cities in Michigan, is a completely separate jurisdiction from any townships adjacent to it.

The Leonard post office changed its name to Big Rapids on September 29, 1859. Thus the June 1, 1860, U.S. Federal Census lists inhabitants of Leonard Township, with their post office as &quot;Big Rapids&quot;.

In 1865, by act of the Michigan Legislature, the name of Leonard Township was changed to Big Rapids Township.

<doc id="118126" wikidata="Q3082629" url="?curid=118126" title="Daggett, Michigan">
<text>Daggett is a village in Menominee County of the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 201 at the 2020 census, down from 258 in 2010. The village is located within Daggett Township and is part of the Marinette, WI–MI Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Daggett was originally named &quot;Section 25&quot;. The name &quot;Daggett&quot; refers either to Elmira Daggett, a New York native who came to the area to visit her brother and is then said to have become the village&#x27;s first postmistress, or to postmistress Clara Daggett&#x27;s father (a native of Elmira, New York), the father-in-law of the village&#x27;s founder, Thomas Faulkner.

The village of Daggett was incorporated on August 30, 1902. &quot;Because of the number of fires in the village, and with no help from [Stephenson] township, the Daggett people decided the best way to get fire protection was to incorporate.&quot; Incorporated villages had been given the power to raise money for fire protection by the state legislature. The village lost little time in equipping a modern fire department. Mr. J. H. Earle, representing the Waterous Gasoline Fire Engine Co. of St. Paul, Minnesota, signed a contract with the village council on October 17, 1902, promising delivery of an engine and 1,000 feet of hose within 30 days. 
The Waterous product was among the most modern of the era, representing the transition from heavy steam-powered pumps. It coupled a four-cylinder gasoline motor to a 350 gallon-per-minute pump. The entire apparatus was light enough to be pulled rapidly by a team of horses or men. To provide ready water sources for the pumper, the village contracted during the last week of October 1902 for four cisterns to be dug at different locations in the village. The contract was completed by November 15, 1902. 
The engine was delivered to the village between November 17–21, 1902, the exact date being uncertain. Based on the report in the November 22, 1902 &quot;Menominee County Journal&quot;, the Daggett Volunteer Fire Department commenced operations on November 21, 1902. The modern fire engine in use at Daggett drew attention from neighboring communities, including the Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin, fire department, who visited Daggett in January 1903 to observe the new engine. The Waterous unit likely served the village until replaced by a motorized engine from the same company in 1925.

==Geography==
Daggett is in south-central Menominee County along U.S. Route 41, which passes through the east side of the village and leads south to Menominee, the county seat, and north to Powers. The small city of Stephenson is south along US 41.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village of Daggett has a total area of , all land. The Little Cedar River, a south-flowing tributary of the Menominee River, passes just south of the village.

<text>Menominee ( ) is a city and the county seat of Menominee County, Michigan in the Upper Peninsula. The population was 8,488 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Menominee County. Menominee is the fourth-largest city in the Upper Peninsula, behind Marquette, Sault Ste. Marie, and Escanaba. Menominee Township is located to the north of the city, but is politically autonomous.

Menominee is part of the Marinette, WI–MI micropolitan statistical area.

==History==
In historic times, this area was the traditional territory of the Menominee Indian Tribe. The town of Menominee was named after their English name which roughly translates as &quot;wild rice,&quot; a nickname given to them by their Ojibwe neighbors based on their cultivation of wild rice as a staple food. In their own language, they are known as &quot;Mamaceqtaw&quot; which means simply &quot;the people&quot;, and the town of Menominee is known as &quot;Menīkāneh&quot;, which means &quot;at the good village&quot;. They were removed to west of the Mississippi River and now have a reservation along the Wolf River in North Central Wisconsin after ceding their territory to the United States in the 1836 Treaty of the Cedars.

Menominee gained prominence in the 19th century as a lumber town; in its heyday, it produced more lumber than any other city in the United States of America. During this time of prosperity, the Menominee Opera House was built. It is being restored. In the 1910s, a cycle car, the &quot;Dudly Bug&quot;, was manufactured in Menominee. In the waning years of lumber production, local business interests, interested in diversifying Menominee&#x27;s manufacturing base, attracted inventor Marshall Burns Lloyd and his Minneapolis company Lloyd Manufacturing, which made wicker baby buggies. In 1917, Lloyd invented an automated process for weaving wicker and manufactured it as the Lloyd Loom. This machine process is still in use today. In the 21st century, the economy of Menominee is based on manufacturing (paper products, wicker lawn furniture, and auto supplies) and tourism.

In 1940, during the &quot;Vote for Gracie&quot; publicity stunt in which comedian Gracie Allen ran for president, she was nominated for mayor of Menominee, but was disqualified because she was not a resident of the city.

===Sports===
The Menominee Maroons won the state high school championship in its division for basketball in 1967 and football in 1998, 2006 and 2007. In the 2006 season, the Maroons finished unbeaten and only allowed 38 points scored against them but their offense scored 513 points in that entire season. They beat the former Wisconsin and Minnesota Division One state champions. Menominee shares a historic high school football rivalry with neighbor Marinette, Wisconsin. The two have conducted the third-longest rivalry in the nation.

Menominee, like most good-sized towns, embraced the newly emerging 19th-century sport of football. A local group took the name of North End Athletic Club and, under manager McPhaul, were the visiting opponent for the newly formed Green Bay team sponsored by the Indian Packing Co. led by captain Curly Lambeau. The Indian Co. Packers of Green Bay defeated the N.E.A.C. Colts of Menominee 53–0 at Hagemeister Field.

==Geography==

Menominee has a cairn marking the halfway point between the North Pole and the Equator. This is slightly north of the 45th parallel north, due to the flattening of the earth at the poles. This is one of six Michigan sites and 29 places in the U.S.A. where such signs are known to exist.

Menominee, Michigan, is also the site of the Menominee Crack, an unusual geological feature that formed spontaneously in 2010.

===Twin city with Marinette, Wisconsin===
Menominee and Marinette, Wisconsin are sometimes described as &quot;twin cities&quot;.

Menominee shares a hospital, community foundation, newspaper and chamber of commerce with Marinette. Marinette is the principal city of the Marinette, Wisconsin–Menominee, Michigan Micropolitan Statistical Area. Numerous city groups work together to benefit the entire two-city, two-county and two-state community.

===Car ferries===
Ann Arbor Railroad ran cross-Lake Michigan car ferries from Betsie Lake, Elberta, Michigan, to Menominee starting in 1894, and also connected railcar freight with the Wisconsin &amp; Michigan Railway until 1938 or some time after.

The location of the Ann Arbor car ferry slip in Lighthouse Ann Arbor Park has been converted to a boat launch.

===Railroad===

Currently, the railroad lines serving the twin cities only offer freight service as provided by the Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad.

The Milwaukee Road railroad began passenger service to Menominee in 1903. That year they constructed a rail passenger depot, running frequent trips between Menominee and Ellis Junction (now Crivitz). They shared the station tracks with the Wisconsin &amp; Michigan Railway. The passenger ridership dropped significantly by 1920 causing the Milwaukee Road to abandon service to the Menominee station in May 1927 and after that closed the station. The Wisconsin and Michigan Railroad continued their freight service to 1938.

The Chicago and Northwestern Railroad also had a freight and passenger station on 7th Street in town. Passenger service to the C&amp;NW station ended on July 16, 1969. 

The Milwaukee Road railroad passenger station is located at 219 West Fourth Avenue. The station was built in 1903 originally as a part of the Menominee Branch Railroad Company (chartered July 2, 1883). Currently under private ownership.

<text>Erie Township is a civil township of Monroe County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 4,299 at the 2020 census. Sharing a southern border with the city of Toledo, Ohio, about southwest of the city of Detroit, the township is one of the southernmost areas included in the Detroit–Warren–Ann Arbor Combined Statistical Area (Metro Detroit).

The township was organized in 1827 and is the southeasternmost municipality in the state of Michigan. The city of Luna Pier is mostly surrounded by the township, but the two are administered autonomously since Luna Pier incorporated as a city in 1963.

==History==
Erie was started in 1790 by Métis people moving south from Monroe. Early on, a log church named St. Joseph sur la Baie Miami was built here. Father Gabriel Richard often conducted mass here.

The township was officially organized as one of the first five townships in Monroe County, Michigan Territory, in 1827. The township was originally much larger and included the present-day townships of Bedford, La Salle, and about a stretch of the Toledo Strip. When a post office was established in 1827, it was given the name of &quot;Bay Settlement&quot;. The township&#x27;s name was changed to Erie in 1835. Bedford Township and La Salle Township were broken off from Erie Township and established in 1836. In the same year, the Toledo Strip portion of Erie Township was given to the state of Ohio. Luna Pier, which occupied the northeast portion of the township, incorporated as a city in 1963, separating it from the township.

The last boundary change within Erie Township came in 1973 when the Supreme Court of the United States intervened on a border dispute involving the small and uninhabited Turtle Island, offshore in Lake Erie. The island was divided in half, with one side given to Erie Township. The other side of the island, which contains the abandoned Turtle Island Light, was given to Ohio.

==Communities==
*Alexis is a former settlement beginning in 1878 that was at a junction of two railway lines heading south from Detroit. The site was also known as Detroit Junction.
*Erie is an unincorporated community located in the northwest portion of the township at . As one of the county&#x27;s oldest communities, Erie was first settled as early as 1790 by settlers from the north in Frenchtown. It was given a post office named &quot;Bay Settlement&quot; on April 18, 1827. The name was changed to &quot;Erie&quot; after the township on March 5, 1835, and remains in operation.
*Havre is a former settlement located about north of the state border on the north shores of Maumee Bay. A post office operated very briefly here for about five months from June 19 until December 15, 1837. 
*Vienna is a historic locale located at . Founded in 1882, it served as a branch on the Michigan Central Railroad in 1882.
*Vistula was a settlement located within the former boundaries of the township. A land company bought and platted the community in 1832, and the territory built a roadway here. A post office in Vistula was established on January 8, 1834, and operated very briefly until it was closed on January 9, 1835, during the onset of the Toledo War. When the border dispute was resolved by 1836, the area of Vistula was transferred to the state of Ohio. The only remnants of the former settlement are included in the Vistula Historic District in Toledo.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which are land and , or 19.32%, are water.

Erie Township includes Gard Island, Indian Island, and a portion of Turtle Island in Lake Erie. The Ottawa River runs through the southeasternmost portion of the township and empties into North Maumee Bay within the township. The township also includes the North Maumee Bay Archeological District and portions of the Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge. The Lost Peninsula is located in the southeasternmost portion of the township. It is located on Point Place Peninsula, which is bordered by the Ottawa River on the west and Maumee Bay on the east. Lost Peninsula is an exclave of the township (and of the state of Michigan), as its only land border is with the state of Ohio. The Toledo neighborhood of Point Place borders Lost Peninsula to the south.

The township is bordered by Lake Erie to the east, Bedford Township to the west, La Salle Township to the north, and the city of Luna Pier to the northeast. The state of Ohio borders to the south, including portions of the city of Toledo and Washington Township.

There had been other French colonial settlements closer to Detroit and on both sides of the Detroit River. Their descendants are known as Muskrat French. Around the same time, the Sandy Creek Settlement was founded near this by Joseph Porlier Benec. The United States acquired this area, which had been considered part of British Canadian territory after the Treaty of Paris (1783) settling the American Revolutionary War. It was specifically part of state claims (from 1783); the Northwest Territory (1787); Indiana Territory (1803); Michigan Territory (1805); and, finally, the State of Michigan (1837).

During the War of 1812, the area was the site of the Battle of Frenchtown, in which 397 Americans were killed by the coalition of British Army and Native Americans; this was the highest number of American fatalities of any battle during the war. The battlefield site today is within the River Raisin National Battlefield Park, which was designated in 2009 and falls within the present-day city limits of Monroe.

In 1817, that portion of Frenchtown was renamed and incorporated as the village of Monroe, named in honor of President James Monroe&#x27;s planned visit to the Michigan Territory later that year. In the same year, the village of Monroe was named as the county seat of the newly created Monroe County. Monroe was incorporated as a city in 1837. At that time, the remaining area known as Frenchtown was reorganized as a township, encompassing much of the northern portion of the county which was the area from the River Raisin to the Huron River at Wayne County&#x27;s southern border. Shortly afterwards, the northern portion of the township was broken off to form Ash Township. Later, by 1867, Berlin Charter Township was formed from another territory of the township. Additionally, the city of Monroe annexed pieces of the southern portion of Frenchtown several times. As a result, the boundary between the current Frenchtown Charter Township and the city limits of Monroe is jagged.

<text>Maybee ( ) is a village in Monroe County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 545 at the 2020 census. The village is located within Exeter Township. Maybee was established in 1873 and incorporated as a village in 1899.

==History==

Maybee was established as early as 1873 in the southwest part of Exeter Township when the Canada Southern Railway built a railway line through the area. The line was soon transferred to the Detroit, Toledo and Ironton Railroad, which transported manufactured charcoal and other forest products from Maybee to Detroit in the northeast and Ohio to the south. The community was named for early settler Abram Maybee. Along with Joseph Klotz, the two surveyed, platted, and bought and sold the land by 1875. The village grew to include a grain elevator, gristmill, mining quarry and sand pit, hotel, several churches and schools, and numerous small factories and stores. The growing population led to Maybee becoming incorporated as a village in 1899.

The Maybee Station no longer exists, but the railway line continues to run through the village. The line is currently operated by the Canadian National Railway but no longer contains a station at this point along its route.

Maybee received its first post office on February 24, 1874. This post office was discontinued on February 3, 1972. Another post office was established on August 1, 1903, and this office remains in operation and is currently located at 7580 Mill Street. 

The London–Maybee–Raisinville Volunteer Fire Department was formed in 1952 and serves the village and surrounding area. The station is located at 8755 Baldwin Road in the southwest corner of the village.

The village of Maybee contains two active cemeteries along Raisin Street. The Northside Cemetery and Saint Joseph Cemetery are located within the village boundaries. The North Side Cemetery contains graves dating back to 1876, while the Saint Joseph Cemetery has graves dating back to 1871.

The village boundaries remained the same from 1899 until 2013 when the village acquired of land belonging to the Stoneco Quarry just north of the village. The current village offices are located at 9043 Raisin Street, which is next to the Maybee Village Hall. The historic hall was first constructed in 1912 and housed the village government offices and fire station until 1977. The structure was listed as a Michigan State Historic Site on March 15, 1988. The building has been used since March 2021 as a sheriff substation for the Monroe County Police Department.

<text>Monroe is the largest city and county seat of Monroe County, Michigan, United States. The population was 20,462 as of the 2020 census. The city is bordered on the south by Monroe Charter Township, but the two are administered autonomously. Monroe is the core city in the Monroe metropolitan area, which is coterminous with Monroe County and had a population of 154,809 in 2020. Located on the western shores of Lake Erie approximately northeast of Toledo, Ohio, and southwest of Detroit, the city is part of the Detroit–Ann Arbor–Flint combined statistical area.

The Monroe area was the scene of several military conflicts during the War of 1812 against the United Kingdom and is known for the Battle of Frenchtown. In 1817, portions of the Frenchtown settlement along the River Raisin were platted and renamed &quot;Monroe&quot; after then-president James Monroe. When Michigan became a state in 1837, Monroe was incorporated as a city.

Monroe is known as the childhood residence of George Armstrong Custer and other members of his family, including his brother Boston Custer and wife Elizabeth Bacon. Several structures are named after Custer, including Custer Airport. Founded in 1928, the La-Z-Boy world headquarters are located in Monroe.

==History==
Long occupied by varying cultures of indigenous peoples, the area around the River Raisin was settled by the historic Potawatomi hundreds of years before French explorers and colonists reached it in the late seventeenth century. Robert de LaSalle claimed the area for New France after his 1679 expedition on the &quot;Griffon&quot;.

In 1784, after the American Revolutionary War, Francis Navarre of Canada was given a portion of land south of the River Raisin by the Potawatomi. Colonists settled Frenchtown shortly thereafter as the third European community in what in the early 19th century became the state of Michigan. Around the same time, the Sandy Creek Settlement was established just north of Frenchtown by French-Canadian Joseph Porlier Benec.

Because of its proximity to Detroit, the area was of strategic importance during the War of 1812 between the United States and Great Britain, especially after Fort Detroit surrendered to the British in August 1812. American forces en route to retake Detroit camped in the area of the River Raisin in the winter of 1812–13. A force of 200 Native Americans and 63 Canadian militia were forced to retreat north away from the River Raisin by 600 Kentucky militiamen and 100 French, under the command of James Winchester, on January 18, 1813. This skirmish was later dubbed the &quot;First Battle of the River Raisin&quot;.

On January 22, 1813, a force of 800 Native Americans and 597 British, under Henry Proctor, surprised the force of 1,000 Americans and captured Frenchtown. Many of the American militia were inexperienced, ill-trained, and badly equipped. They suffered 397 killed and 547 captured. The British and their allies had only slight losses.

When the British departed with their captives to Detroit, they left those Americans too wounded to walk in the homes of Frenchtown inhabitants under the guard of a small British detachment and Native American allies, including Potawatomi. The morning after the battle, other Native Americans returned to Frenchtown. They plundered and burned homes, and killed and ritually scalped many of the remaining American captives, taking others as slaves. The official U.S. estimate of casualties in this aftermath include a dozen named individuals killed and up to 30 more who were likely killed. The British estimated six Americans were killed.

This event became known throughout the United States as the &quot;River Raisin Massacre&quot;. It was also known as the Battle of Frenchtown (or the Second Battle of the River Raisin). Today, the site of the battle is preserved as the River Raisin National Battlefield Park, authorized in 2009. It is the first and so far the only national battlefield established for a solely War of 1812 site. It has a small visitor center.

The Frenchtown community was renamed after the War of 1812 and incorporated as the village of Monroe in honor of President James Monroe, who visited the Michigan Territory in 1817. In the same year, the city of Monroe was named as the county seat of the newly created Monroe County. Monroe was re-incorporated as a city in 1837.

Settled mostly by American migrants from New York and New England, Monroe later became associated with events in the West in the later 19th century, particularly the Indian Wars. It was the childhood home of George Armstrong Custer (1839–1876), who had a military career in which he reached the rank of major general. His family moved here when he was young, and he lived in Monroe for much of his childhood. Here he later met and in 1864 married Elizabeth Bacon (1842–1933), during the Civil War. In the later 19th century, he led troops in the Indian Wars and died at the Battle of the Little Bighorn, in which his forces were killed by the Lakota, who call it the Battle of the Greasy Grass.

In 1910, President William Howard Taft and the widow Elizabeth Bacon Custer unveiled an equestrian statue of Custer, which now stands at the corner of Elm Avenue and Monroe Street. Custer is also honored in street names, various historic markers, buildings, schools, and the regional Custer Airport. City limit signs for Monroe describe the city as &quot;the home of General Custer.&quot;

The La-Z-Boy furniture company, which became known for its reclining easy chairs, was founded in Monroe in 1927. Their world headquarters are located in Monroe, south of the intersection of La-Z-Boy Boulevard and Stewart Road. This new facility is roughly a half mile east of the original location on Telegraph Road; the old building was demolished in 2021, and the site is being redeveloped.

In 1974, the Monroe Power Plant opened. It is the third largest coal-fired plant in the United States, with a capacity of 3,280 megawatts. At tall, the dual smokestacks are visible from more than away and are among the tallest structures in the state.

In December 1989, a combination of zebra mussels and ice clogged the sole intake pipe of the Monroe water treatment plant, forcing a two-day shutdown of the city&#x27;s schools, industries, and businesses.

* has its southern terminus north of Monroe. Splitting off from I-75, I-275 is a western bypass around Detroit. Aside from I-75, the highway can be accessed from Monroe by US 24 (Telegraph Road) via exit 2.
* terminates in Monroe at US 24 and provides a direct route to Dundee, Jackson, and further. In Monroe, M-50 is known locally as South Custer Road. Its former terminus used to be I-75 at exit 15.
* travels through Monroe and provides access to Toledo and western portions of Detroit. The road is known locally as North Telegraph and South Telegraph — divided at the River Raisin. US 24 also connects to I-275 just north of Monroe.
* travels directly through the downtown area before merging into US 24 north of Monroe. South of downtown after Jones Avenue, it is called South Dixie Highway. In the downtown area, it is South Monroe Street. North of the River Raisin, it is North Monroe Street.

* The Dixie Highway ran through Monroe in as early as 1915. It was originally one of the few ways to reach places like Florida, but the highway was largely replaced by I-75 beginning in the 1960s. Today, the namesake of the highway is used for two non-connecting highways (one being M-125), although the same route and remnants of the original highway are long gone.

===Railroads===
Present-day freight hauling railroads operating through and around Monroe are the Norfolk Southern, CSX, and the Canadian National. Historic railroads operating until the 1950s to 1960s were the Pere Marquette, Ann Arbor, Wabash, Grand Trunk Western, and the Detroit, Toledo, and Ironton. The Baltimore and Ohio had trackage rights with the PM and the Wabash upon which to operate its Detroit to Toledo passenger trains such as the Ambassador which after Toledo continued to Washington, D.C., and from there northward to Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City.

===Interurbans===
From 1900 to the 1930s, the electric Detroit United Railway (eventually becoming the Eastern Michigan Ry) operated hourly interurban passenger service between Detroit and Toledo through Monroe. The DU/EM provided valuable and frequent passenger transportation plus carryed freight at a time of unpaved and unreliable roads. The gradual business lost as Michigan and Ohio and their towns paved highways in the 1920s and resulting growing truck and automobile use, plus the 1930–32 dramatic loss of business caused by the economic impact of the Great Depression shut the interurban down in 1932. The Eastern Michigan had carried considerable freight and passengers from Detroit to Cleveland exchanged with the Lake Shore Electric interurban at Toledo. Similarly, it had carried freight and passengers from Detroit to Dayton, Columbus, and Cincinnati exchanged with the Cincinnati and Lake Erie interurban at Toledo.

<text>Whiteford Township is a civil township of Monroe County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 4,590 at the 2020 census.

==Early history==
Whiteford Township was organized in March 1834 and carved out of western parts of Erie Township and the former Port Lawrence Township. It was named after Gen. David White, the township&#x27;s first supervisor and a pioneer settler. At the time of founding, Whiteford Township was a much larger township in land area than it is today. It originally extended into present-day Ohio, when that part of the state (known as the Toledo Strip) was claimed by both Ohio and Michigan during the Toledo War. This larger Whiteford Township included most of present-day Sylvania, Sylvania Township, northern Springfield Township, and a small section of present-day Toledo north of Airport Highway between Reynolds Road and Holland-Sylvania. However, by December 1836, the boundary dispute between Ohio and Michigan had been settled, the Toledo Strip was awarded to Ohio, and Whiteford Township subsequently lost all of its territory south of this newly agreed upon state boundary.

In 1880, the total population of the township was 2,044, of which 2,030 residents were classified as White and 14 were listed as Black/Mulatto. By 1900 the population had risen to 2,050, with all residents listed as White.

<text>Staphylococcus aureus is a gram-positive spherically shaped bacterium, a member of the Bacillota, and is a usual member of the microbiota of the body, frequently found in the upper respiratory tract and on the skin. It is often positive for catalase and nitrate reduction and is a facultative anaerobe, meaning that it can grow without oxygen. Although &quot;S. aureus&quot; usually acts as a commensal of the human microbiota, it can also become an opportunistic pathogen, being a common cause of skin infections including abscesses, respiratory infections such as sinusitis, and food poisoning. Pathogenic strains often promote infections by producing virulence factors such as potent protein toxins, and the expression of a cell-surface protein that binds and inactivates antibodies. &quot;S. aureus&quot; is one of the leading pathogens for deaths associated with antimicrobial resistance and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains, such as methicillin-resistant &quot;S. aureus&quot; (MRSA). The bacterium is a worldwide problem in clinical medicine. Despite much research and development, no vaccine for &quot;S. aureus&quot; has been approved.

An estimated 21% to 30% of the human population are long-term carriers of &quot;S. aureus&quot;, which can be found as part of the normal skin microbiota, in the nostrils, and as a normal inhabitant of the lower reproductive tract of females. &quot;S. aureus&quot; can cause a range of illnesses, from minor skin infections, such as pimples, impetigo, boils, cellulitis, folliculitis, carbuncles, scalded skin syndrome, and abscesses, to life-threatening diseases such as pneumonia, meningitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, toxic shock syndrome, bacteremia, and sepsis. It is still one of the five most common causes of hospital-acquired infections and is often the cause of wound infections following surgery. Each year, around 500,000 hospital patients in the United States contract a staphylococcal infection, chiefly by &quot;S. aureus&quot;. Up to 50,000 deaths each year in the U.S. are linked to staphylococcal infection.

== History ==

=== Discovery ===
In 1880, Alexander Ogston, a Scottish surgeon, discovered that &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; can cause wound infections after noticing groups of bacteria in pus from a surgical abscess during a procedure he was performing. He named it &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; after its clustered appearance evident under a microscope. Then, in 1884, German scientist Friedrich Julius Rosenbach identified &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, discriminating and separating it from &quot;Staphylococcus albus&quot;, a related bacterium. In the early 1930s, doctors began to use a more streamlined test to detect the presence of an &quot;S. aureus&quot; infection by the means of coagulase testing, which enables detection of an enzyme produced by the bacterium. Prior to the 1940s, &quot;S. aureus&quot; infections were fatal in the majority of patients. However, doctors discovered that the use of penicillin could cure &quot;S. aureus&quot; infections. Unfortunately, by the end of the 1940s, penicillin resistance became widespread amongst this bacterium population and outbreaks of the resistant strain began to occur.

=== Evolution ===
&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; can be sorted into ten dominant human lineages. There are numerous minor lineages as well, but these are not seen in the population as often. Genomes of bacteria within the same lineage are mostly conserved, with the exception of mobile genetic elements. Mobile genetic elements that are common in &quot;S. aureus&quot; include bacteriophages, pathogenicity islands, plasmids, transposons, and staphylococcal cassette chromosomes. These elements have enabled &quot;S. aureus&quot; to continually evolve and gain new traits. There is a great deal of genetic variation within the &quot;S. aureus&quot; species&quot;.&quot; A study by Fitzgerald et al. (2001) revealed that approximately 22% of the &quot;S. aureus&quot; genome is non-coding and thus can differ from bacterium to bacterium. An example of this difference is seen in the species&#x27; virulence. Only a few strains of &quot;S. aureus&quot; are associated with infections in humans. This demonstrates that there is a large range of infectious ability within the species.

It has been proposed that one possible reason for the great deal of heterogeneity within the species could be due to its reliance on heterogeneous infections. This occurs when multiple different types of &quot;S. aureus&quot; cause an infection within a host. The different strains can secrete different enzymes or bring different antibiotic resistances to the group, increasing its pathogenic ability. Thus, there is a need for a large number of mutations and acquisitions of mobile genetic elements.

Another notable evolutionary process within the &quot;S. aureus&quot; species is its co-evolution with its human hosts. Over time, this parasitic relationship has led to the bacterium&#x27;s ability to be carried in the nasopharynx of humans without causing symptoms or infection. This allows it to be passed throughout the human population, increasing its fitness as a species. However, only approximately 50% of the human population are carriers of &quot;S. aureus&quot;, with 20% as continuous carriers and 30% as intermittent. This leads scientists to believe that there are many factors that determine whether &quot;S. aureus&quot; is carried asymptomatically in humans, including factors that are specific to an individual person. According to a 1995 study by Hofman et al., these factors may include age, sex, diabetes, and smoking. They also determined some genetic variations in humans that lead to an increased ability for &quot;S. aureus&quot; to colonize, notably a polymorphism in the glucocorticoid receptor gene that results in larger corticosteroid production. In conclusion, there is evidence that any strain of this bacterium can become invasive, as this is highly dependent upon human factors.

Though &quot;S. aureus&quot; has quick reproductive and micro-evolutionary rates, there are multiple barriers that prevent evolution with the species. One such barrier is AGR, which is a global accessory gene regulator within the bacteria. This such regulator has been linked to the virulence level of the bacteria. Loss of function mutations within this gene have been found to increase the fitness of the bacterium containing it. Thus, &quot;S. aureus&quot; must make a trade-off to increase their success as a species, exchanging reduced virulence for increased drug resistance. Another barrier to evolution is the Sau1 Type I restriction modification (RM) system. This system exists to protect the bacterium from foreign DNA by digesting it. Exchange of DNA between the same lineage is not blocked, since they have the same enzymes and the RM system does not recognize the new DNA as foreign, but transfer between different lineages is blocked.

== Microbiology ==
&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (, Greek , Latin , ) is a facultative anaerobic, gram-positive coccal (round) bacterium also known as &quot;golden staph&quot; and &quot;oro staphira&quot;. &quot;S. aureus&quot; is nonmotile and does not form spores. In medical literature, the bacterium is often referred to as &quot;S. aureus&quot;, &quot;Staph aureus&quot; or &quot;Staph a.&quot;. &quot;S. aureus&quot; appears as staphylococci (grape-like clusters) when viewed through a microscope, and has large, round, golden-yellow colonies, often with hemolysis, when grown on blood agar plates. &quot;S. aureus&quot; reproduces asexually by binary fission. Complete separation of the daughter cells is mediated by &quot;S. aureus&quot; autolysin, and in its absence or targeted inhibition, the daughter cells remain attached to one another and appear as clusters.

&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; is catalase-positive (meaning it can produce the enzyme catalase). Catalase converts hydrogen peroxide () to water and oxygen. Catalase-activity tests are sometimes used to distinguish staphylococci from enterococci and streptococci. Previously, &quot;S. aureus&quot; was differentiated from other staphylococci by the coagulase test. However, not all &quot;S. aureus&quot; strains are coagulase-positive and incorrect species identification can impact effective treatment and control measures.

Natural genetic transformation is a reproductive process involving DNA transfer from one bacterium to another through the intervening medium, and the integration of the donor sequence into the recipient genome by homologous recombination. &quot;S. aureus&quot; was found to be capable of natural genetic transformation, but only at low frequency under the experimental conditions employed. Further studies suggested that the development of competence for natural genetic transformation may be substantially higher under appropriate conditions, yet to be discovered.

==Role in health==
In humans, &quot;S. aureus&quot; can be present in the upper respiratory tract, gut mucosa, and skin as a member of the normal microbiota. However, because &quot;S. aureus&quot; can cause disease under certain host and environmental conditions, it is characterized as a pathobiont.

== Role in disease ==


While &quot;S. aureus&quot; usually acts as a commensal bacterium, asymptomatically colonizing about 30% of the human population, it can sometimes cause disease. In particular, &quot;S. aureus&quot; is one of the most common causes of bacteremia and infective endocarditis. Additionally, it can cause various skin and soft-tissue infections, particularly when skin or mucosal barriers have been breached.

&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; infections can spread through contact with pus from an infected wound, skin-to-skin contact with an infected person, and contact with objects used by an infected person such as towels, sheets, clothing, or athletic equipment. Joint replacements put a person at particular risk of septic arthritis, staphylococcal endocarditis (infection of the heart valves), and pneumonia.

&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; is a significant cause of chronic biofilm infections on medical implants, and the repressor of toxins is part of the infection pathway.

&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; can lie dormant in the body for years undetected. Once symptoms begin to show, the host is contagious for another two weeks, and the overall illness lasts a few weeks. If untreated, though, the disease can be deadly. Deeply penetrating &quot;S. aureus&quot; infections can be severe.

=== Skin infections ===
Skin infections are the most common form of &quot;S. aureus&quot; infection. This can manifest in various ways, including small benign boils, folliculitis, impetigo, cellulitis, and more severe, invasive soft-tissue infections.

&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; is extremely prevalent in persons with atopic dermatitis (AD), more commonly known as eczema. It is mostly found in fertile, active places, including the armpits, hair, and scalp. Large pimples that appear in those areas may exacerbate the infection if lacerated. Colonization of &quot;S. aureus&quot; drives inflammation of AD. &quot;S. aureus&quot; is believed to exploit defects in the skin barrier of persons with atopic dermatitis, triggering cytokine expression and therefore exacerbating symptoms. This can lead to staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, a severe form of which can be seen in newborns.

The role of &quot;S. aureus&quot; in causing itching in atopic dermatitis has been studied.

Antibiotics are commonly used to target overgrowth of &quot;S. aureus&quot; but their benefit is limited and they increase the risk of antimicrobial resistance. For these reasons, they are only recommended for people who not only present symptoms on the skin but feel systematically unwell.

=== Food poisoning ===
&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; is also responsible for food poisoning and achieves this by generating toxins in the food, which is then ingested. Its incubation period lasts 30 minutes to eight hours, with the illness itself lasting from 30 minutes to 3 days. Preventive measures one can take to help prevent the spread of the disease include washing hands thoroughly with soap and water before preparing food. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends staying away from any food if ill, and wearing gloves if any open wounds occur on hands or wrists while preparing food. If storing food for longer than 2 hours, it is recommended to keep the food below 4.4 or above 60 °C (below 40 or above 140 °F).

=== Bone and joint infections ===
&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; is a common cause of major bone and joint infections, including osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and infections following joint replacement surgeries.

=== Bacteremia ===
&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; is a leading cause of bloodstream infections throughout much of the industrialized world. Infection is generally associated with breaks in the skin or mucosal membranes due to surgery, injury, or use of intravascular devices such as cannulas, hemodialysis machines, or hypodermic needles. Once the bacteria have entered the bloodstream, they can infect various organs, causing infective endocarditis, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis. This disease is particularly prevalent and severe in the very young and very old.

Without antibiotic treatment, &quot;S. aureus&quot; bacteremia has a case fatality rate around 80%. With antibiotic treatment, case fatality rates range from 15% to 50% depending on the age and health of the patient, as well as the antibiotic resistance of the &quot;S. aureus&quot; strain.

===Medical implant infections===
&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; is often found in biofilms formed on medical devices implanted in the body or on human tissue. It is commonly found with another pathogen, &quot;Candida albicans&quot;, forming multispecies biofilms. The latter is suspected to help &quot;S. aureus&quot; penetrate human tissue. A higher mortality is linked with multispecies biofilms.

&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; biofilm is the predominant cause of orthopedic implant-related infections, but is also found on cardiac implants, vascular grafts, various catheters, and cosmetic surgical implants. After implantation, the surface of these devices becomes coated with host proteins, which provide a rich surface for bacterial attachment and biofilm formation. Once the device becomes infected, it must be completely removed, since &quot;S. aureus&quot; biofilm cannot be destroyed by antibiotic treatments.

Current therapy for &quot;S. aureus&quot; biofilm-mediated infections involves surgical removal of the infected device followed by antibiotic treatment. Conventional antibiotic treatment alone is not effective in eradicating such infections. An alternative to postsurgical antibiotic treatment is using antibiotic-loaded, dissolvable calcium sulfate beads, which are implanted with the medical device. These beads can release high doses of antibiotics at the desired site to prevent the initial infection.

Novel treatments for &quot;S. aureus&quot; biofilm involving nano silver particles, bacteriophages, and plant-derived antibiotic agents are being studied. These agents have shown inhibitory effects against &quot;S. aureus&quot; embedded in biofilms. A class of enzymes have been found to have biofilm matrix-degrading ability, thus may be used as biofilm dispersal agents in combination with antibiotics.

=== Animal infections ===
&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; can survive on dogs, cats, and horses, and can cause bumblefoot in chickens. Some believe health-care workers&#x27; dogs should be considered a significant source of antibiotic-resistant &quot;S. aureus&quot;, especially in times of outbreak. In a 2008 study by Boost, O&#x27;Donoghue, and James, it was found that just about 90% of &quot;S. aureus&quot; colonized within pet dogs presented as resistant to at least one antibiotic. The nasal region has been implicated as the most important site of transfer between dogs and humans.

&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; is one of the causal agents of mastitis in dairy cows. Its large polysaccharide capsule protects the organism from recognition by the cow&#x27;s immune defenses.

== Virulence factors ==
=== Enzymes ===
&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; produces various enzymes such as coagulase (bound and free coagulases) which facilitates the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin to cause clots which is important in skin infections. Hyaluronidase (also known as spreading factor) breaks down hyaluronic acid and helps in spreading it. Deoxyribonuclease, which breaks down the DNA, protects &quot;S. aureus&quot; from neutrophil extracellular trap-mediated killing. &quot;S. aureus&quot; also produces lipase to digest lipids, staphylokinase to dissolve fibrin and aid in spread, and beta-lactamase for drug resistance.

=== Toxins ===

Depending on the strain, &quot;S. aureus&quot; is capable of secreting several exotoxins, which can be categorized into three groups. Many of these toxins are associated with specific diseases.

;Superantigens
:Antigens known as superantigens can induce toxic shock syndrome (TSS). This group comprises 25 staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) which have been identified to date and named alphabetically (SEA–SEZ), including enterotoxin type B as well as the toxic shock syndrome toxin TSST-1 which causes TSS associated with tampon use. Toxic shock syndrome is characterized by fever, erythematous rash, low blood pressure, shock, multiple organ failure, and skin peeling. Lack of antibody to TSST-1 plays a part in the pathogenesis of TSS. Other strains of &quot;S. aureus&quot; can produce an enterotoxin that is the causative agent of a type of gastroenteritis. This form of gastroenteritis is self-limiting, characterized by vomiting and diarrhea 1–6 hours after ingestion of the toxin, with recovery in 8 to 24 hours. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and major abdominal pain.
;Exfoliative toxins

: Exfoliative toxins are exotoxins implicated in the disease staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), which occurs most commonly in infants and young children. It also may occur as epidemics in hospital nurseries. The protease activity of the exfoliative toxins causes peeling of the skin observed with SSSS.

;Other toxins
: Staphylococcal toxins that act on cell membranes include alpha toxin, beta toxin, delta toxin, and several bicomponent toxins. Strains of &quot;S. aureus&quot; can host phages, such as the prophage Φ-PVL that produces Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), to increase virulence. The bicomponent toxin PVL is associated with severe necrotizing pneumonia in children. The genes encoding the components of PVL are encoded on a bacteriophage found in community-associated MRSA strains.

=== Type VII secretion system ===

A secretion system is a highly specialised multi-protein unit that is embedded in the cell envelope with the function of translocating effector proteins from inside of the cell to the extracellular space or into a target host cytosol. The exact structure and function of T7SS is yet to be fully elucidated. Currently, four proteins are known components of &quot;S. aureus&quot; type VII secretion system; EssC is a large integral membrane ATPase – which most likely powers the secretion systems and has been hypothesised forming part of the translocation channel. The other proteins are EsaA, EssB, EssA, that are membrane proteins that function alongside EssC to mediate protein secretion. The exact mechanism of how substrates reach the cell surface is unknown, as is the interaction of the three membrane proteins with each other and EssC.

T7 dependent effector proteins

EsaD is DNA endonuclease toxin secreted by &quot;S. aureus&quot;, has been shown to inhibit growth of competitor &quot;S. aureus&quot; strain &quot;in vitro&quot;. EsaD is cosecreted with chaperone EsaE, which stabilises EsaD structure and brings EsaD to EssC for secretion. Strains that produce EsaD also co-produce EsaG, a cytoplasmic anti-toxin that protects the producer strain from EsaD&#x27;s toxicity.

TspA is another toxin that mediates intraspecies competition. It is a bacteriostatic toxin that has a membrane depolarising activity facilitated by its C-terminal domain. Tsai is a transmembrane protein that confers immunity to the producer strain of TspA, as well as the attacked strains. There is genetic variability of the C-terminal domain of TspA therefore, it seems like the strains may produce different TspA variants to increase competitiveness.

Toxins that play a role in intraspecies competition confers an advantage by promoting successful colonisation in polymicrobial communities such as the nasopharynx and lung by outcompeting lesser strains.

There are also T7 effector proteins that play role a in pathogenesis, for example mutational studies of &quot;S. aureus&quot; have suggested that EsxB and EsxC contribute to persistent infection in a murine abscess model.

EsxX has been implicated in neutrophil lysis, therefore suggested as contributing to the evasion of host immune system. Deletion of &quot;essX&quot; in &quot;S. aureus&quot; resulted in significantly reduced resistance to neutrophils and reduced virulence in murine skin and blood infection models.

Altogether, T7SS and known secreted effector proteins are a strategy of pathogenesis by improving fitness against competitor &quot;S. aureus&quot; species as well as increased virulence via evading the innate immune system and optimising persistent infections.

=== Small RNA ===
The list of small RNAs involved in the control of bacterial virulence in &quot;S. aureus&quot; is growing. This can be facilitated by factors such as increased biofilm formation in the presence of increased levels of such small RNAs. For example, RNAIII, SprD, SprC, RsaE, SprA1, SSR42, ArtR, SprX, and Teg49.

===DNA repair===

Host neutrophils cause DNA double-strand breaks in &quot;S. aureus&quot; through the production of reactive oxygen species. For infection of a host to be successful, &quot;S. aureus&quot; must survive such damages caused by the hosts&#x27; defenses. The two protein complex RexAB encoded by &quot;S. aureus&quot; is employed in the recombinational repair of DNA double-strand breaks.

=== Strategies for post-transcriptional regulation by 3&#x27;untranslated region ===
Many mRNAs in &quot;S. aureus&quot; carry three prime untranslated regions (3&#x27;UTR) longer than 100 nucleotides, which may potentially have a regulatory function.

Further investigation of i&quot;caR&quot; mRNA (mRNA coding for the repressor of the main expolysaccharidic compound of the bacteria biofilm matrix) demonstrated that the 3&#x27;UTR binding to the 5&#x27; UTR can interfere with the translation initiation complex and generate a double stranded substrate for RNase III. The interaction is between the UCCCCUG motif in the 3&#x27;UTR and the Shine-Dalagarno region at the 5&#x27;UTR. Deletion of the motif resulted in IcaR repressor accumulation and inhibition of biofilm development. The biofilm formation is the main cause of &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; implant infections.

=== Biofilm ===
Biofilms are groups of microorganisms, such as bacteria, that attach to each other and grow on wet surfaces. The &quot;S. aureus&quot; biofilm is embedded in a glycocalyx slime layer and can consist of teichoic acids, host proteins, extracellular DNA (eDNA) and sometimes polysaccharide intercellular antigen (PIA). S. aureus biofilms are important in disease pathogenesis, as they can contribute to antibiotic resistance and immune system evasion. &quot;S. aureus&quot; biofilm has high resistance to antibiotic treatments and host immune response. One hypothesis for explaining this is that the biofilm matrix protects the embedded cells by acting as a barrier to prevent antibiotic penetration. However, the biofilm matrix is composed with many water channels, so this hypothesis is becoming increasingly less likely, but a biofilm matrix possibly contains antibiotic‐degrading enzymes such as β-lactamases, which can prevent antibiotic penetration. Another hypothesis is that the conditions in the biofilm matrix favor the formation of persister cells, which are highly antibiotic-resistant, dormant bacterial cells. &quot;S. aureus&quot; biofilms also have high resistance to host immune response. Though the exact mechanism of resistance is unknown, &quot;S. aureus&quot; biofilms have increased growth under the presence of cytokines produced by the host immune response. Host antibodies are less effective for &quot;S. aureus&quot; biofilm due to the heterogeneous antigen distribution, where an antigen may be present in some areas of the biofilm, but completely absent from other areas.

Studies in biofilm development have shown to be related to changes in gene expression. There are specific genes that were found to be crucial in the different biofilm growth stages. Two of these genes include rocD and gudB, which encode for the enzyme&#x27;s ornithine-oxo-acid transaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase, which are important for amino acid metabolism. Studies have shown biofilm development rely on amino acids glutamine and glutamate for proper metabolic functions.

=== Other immunoevasive strategies ===

;Protein A

Protein A is anchored to staphylococcal peptidoglycan pentaglycine bridges (chains of five glycine residues) by the transpeptidase sortase A. Protein A, an IgG-binding protein, binds to the Fc region of an antibody. In fact, studies involving mutation of genes coding for protein A resulted in a lowered virulence of &quot;S. aureus&quot; as measured by survival in blood, which has led to speculation that protein A-contributed virulence requires binding of antibody Fc regions.

Protein A in various recombinant forms has been used for decades to bind and purify a wide range of antibodies by immunoaffinity chromatography. Transpeptidases, such as the sortases responsible for anchoring factors like protein A to the staphylococcal peptidoglycan, are being studied in hopes of developing new antibiotics to target MRSA infections.

;Staphylococcal pigments

Some strains of &quot;S. aureus&quot; are capable of producing staphyloxanthin – a golden-coloured carotenoid pigment. This pigment acts as a virulence factor, primarily by being a bacterial antioxidant which helps the microbe evade the reactive oxygen species which the host immune system uses to kill pathogens.

Mutant strains of &quot;S. aureus&quot; modified to lack staphyloxanthin are less likely to survive incubation with an oxidizing chemical, such as hydrogen peroxide, than pigmented strains. Mutant colonies are quickly killed when exposed to human neutrophils, while many of the pigmented colonies survive. In mice, the pigmented strains cause lingering abscesses when inoculated into wounds, whereas wounds infected with the unpigmented strains quickly heal.

These tests suggest the &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; strains use staphyloxanthin as a defence against the normal human immune system. Drugs designed to inhibit the production of staphyloxanthin may weaken the bacterium and renew its susceptibility to antibiotics. In fact, because of similarities in the pathways for biosynthesis of staphyloxanthin and human cholesterol, a drug developed in the context of cholesterol-lowering therapy was shown to block &quot;S. aureus&quot; pigmentation and disease progression in a mouse infection model.

== Classical diagnosis ==
Depending upon the type of infection present, an appropriate specimen is obtained accordingly and sent to the laboratory for definitive identification by using biochemical or enzyme-based tests. A Gram stain is first performed to guide the way, which should show typical gram-positive bacteria, cocci, in clusters. Second, the isolate is cultured on mannitol salt agar, which is a selective medium with 7.5% NaCl that allows &quot;S. aureus&quot; to grow, producing yellow-colored colonies as a result of mannitol fermentation and subsequent drop in the medium&#x27;s pH.

Furthermore, for differentiation on the species level, catalase (positive for all &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; species), coagulase (fibrin clot formation, positive for &quot;S. aureus&quot;), DNAse (zone of clearance on DNase agar), lipase (a yellow color and rancid odor smell), and phosphatase (a pink color) tests are all done. For staphylococcal food poisoning, phage typing can be performed to determine whether the staphylococci recovered from the food were the source of infection.

=== Rapid diagnosis and typing ===

Diagnostic microbiology laboratories and reference laboratories are key for identifying outbreaks and new strains of &quot;S. aureus&quot;. Recent genetic advances have enabled reliable and rapid techniques for the identification and characterization of clinical isolates of &quot;S. aureus&quot; in real time. These tools support infection control strategies to limit bacterial spread and ensure the appropriate use of antibiotics. Quantitative PCR is increasingly being used to identify outbreaks of infection.

When observing the evolvement of &quot;S. aureus&quot; and its ability to adapt to each modified antibiotic, two basic methods known as &quot;band-based&quot; or &quot;sequence-based&quot; are employed. Keeping these two methods in mind, other methods such as multilocus sequence typing (MLST), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), bacteriophage typing, spa locus typing, and SCCmec typing are often conducted more than others. With these methods, it can be determined where strains of MRSA originated and also where they are currently.

With MLST, this technique of typing uses fragments of several housekeeping genes known as &quot;aroE, glpF, gmk, pta, tip,&quot; and &quot;yqiL&quot;. These sequences are then assigned a number which give to a string of several numbers that serve as the allelic profile. Although this is a common method, a limitation about this method is the maintenance of the microarray which detects newly allelic profiles, making it a costly and time-consuming experiment.

With PFGE, a method which is still very much used dating back to its first success in 1980s, remains capable of helping differentiate MRSA isolates. To accomplish this, the technique uses multiple gel electrophoresis, along with a voltage gradient to display clear resolutions of molecules. The &quot;S. aureus&quot; fragments then transition down the gel, producing specific band patterns that are later compared with other isolates in hopes of identifying related strains. Limitations of the method include practical difficulties with uniform band patterns and PFGE sensitivity as a whole.

Spa locus typing is also considered a popular technique that uses a single locus zone in a polymorphic region of &quot;S. aureus&quot; to distinguish any form of mutations. Although this technique is often inexpensive and less time-consuming, the chance of losing discriminatory power making it hard to differentiate between MLST clonal complexes exemplifies a crucial limitation.

== Treatment ==

For susceptible strains, the treatment of choice for &quot;S. aureus&quot; infection is penicillin. An antibiotic derived from some &quot;Penicillium&quot; fungal species, penicillin inhibits the formation of peptidoglycan cross-linkages that provide the rigidity and strength in a bacterial cell wall. The four-membered β-lactam ring of penicillin is bound to enzyme -transpeptidase, an enzyme that when functional, cross-links chains of peptidoglycan that form bacterial cell walls. The binding of β-lactam to -transpeptidase inhibits the enzyme&#x27;s functionality and it can no longer catalyze the formation of the cross-links. As a result, cell wall formation and degradation are imbalanced, thus resulting in cell death. In most countries, however, penicillin resistance is extremely common (&gt;90%), and first-line therapy is most commonly a penicillinase-resistant β-lactam antibiotic (for example, oxacillin or flucloxacillin, both of which have the same mechanism of action as penicillin) or vancomycin, depending on local resistance patterns. Combination therapy with gentamicin may be used to treat serious infections, such as endocarditis, but its use is controversial because of the high risk of damage to the kidneys. The duration of treatment depends on the site of infection and on severity. Adjunctive rifampicin has been historically used in the management of &quot;S aureus&quot; bacteraemia, but randomised controlled trial evidence has shown this to be of no overall benefit over standard antibiotic therapy.

Antibiotic resistance in &quot;S. aureus&quot; was uncommon when penicillin was first introduced in 1943. Indeed, the original Petri dish on which Alexander Fleming of Imperial College London observed the antibacterial activity of the &quot;Penicillium&quot; fungus was growing a culture of &quot;S. aureus&quot;. By 1950, 40% of hospital &quot;S. aureus&quot; isolates were penicillin-resistant; by 1960, this had risen to 80%.

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, often pronounced or ), is one of a number of greatly feared strains of &quot;S. aureus&quot; which have become resistant to most β-lactam antibiotics. For this reason, vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, is commonly used to combat MRSA. Vancomycin inhibits the synthesis of peptidoglycan, but unlike β-lactam antibiotics, glycopeptide antibiotics target and bind to amino acids in the cell wall, preventing peptidoglycan cross-linkages from forming. MRSA strains are most often found associated with institutions such as hospitals, but are becoming increasingly prevalent in community-acquired infections.

Minor skin infections can be treated with triple antibiotic ointment. One topical agent that is prescribed is mupirocin, a protein synthesis inhibitor that is produced naturally by Pseudomonas fluorescens and has seen success for treatment of S. aureus nasal carriage.

=== Antibiotic resistance ===
&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; was found to be the second leading pathogen for deaths associated with antimicrobial resistance in 2019.

Staphylococcal resistance to penicillin is mediated by penicillinase (a form of beta-lactamase) production: an enzyme that cleaves the β-lactam ring of the penicillin molecule, rendering the antibiotic ineffective. Penicillinase-resistant β-lactam antibiotics, such as methicillin, nafcillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and flucloxacillin are able to resist degradation by staphylococcal penicillinase.

Resistance to methicillin is mediated via the &quot;mec&quot; operon, part of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCC&quot;mec&quot;). SCCmec is a family of mobile genetic elements, which is a major driving force of &quot;S. aureus&quot; evolution. Resistance is conferred by the &quot;mecA&quot; gene, which codes for an altered penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a or PBP2&#x27;) that has a lower affinity for binding β-lactams (penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems). This allows for resistance to all β-lactam antibiotics, and obviates their clinical use during MRSA infections. Studies have explained that this mobile genetic element has been acquired by different lineages in separate gene transfer events, indicating that there is not a common ancestor of differing MRSA strains. One study suggests that MRSA sacrifices virulence, for example, toxin production and invasiveness, for survival and creation of biofilms

Aminoglycoside antibiotics, such as kanamycin, gentamicin, streptomycin, were once effective against staphylococcal infections until strains evolved mechanisms to inhibit the aminoglycosides&#x27; action, which occurs via protonated amine and/or hydroxyl interactions with the ribosomal RNA of the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit. Three main mechanisms of aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms are currently and widely accepted: aminoglycoside modifying enzymes, ribosomal mutations, and active efflux of the drug out of the bacteria.

Aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes inactivate the aminoglycoside by covalently attaching either a phosphate, nucleotide, or acetyl moiety to either the amine or the alcohol key functional group (or both groups) of the antibiotic. This changes the charge or sterically hinders the antibiotic, decreasing its ribosomal binding affinity. In &quot;S. aureus&quot;, the best-characterized aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme is aminoglycoside adenylyltransferase 4&#x27; IA (&quot;ANT(4&#x27;)IA&quot;). This enzyme has been solved by X-ray crystallography. The enzyme is able to attach an adenyl moiety to the 4&#x27; hydroxyl group of many aminoglycosides, including kanamycin and gentamicin.

Glycopeptide resistance is typically mediated by acquisition of the &quot;vanA&quot; gene, which originates from the Tn1546 transposon found in a plasmid in enterococci and codes for an enzyme that produces an alternative peptidoglycan to which vancomycin will not bind.

Today, &quot;S. aureus&quot; has become resistant to many commonly used antibiotics. In the UK, only 2% of all &quot;S. aureus&quot; isolates are sensitive to penicillin, with a similar picture in the rest of the world. The β-lactamase-resistant penicillins (methicillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, and flucloxacillin) were developed to treat penicillin-resistant &quot;S. aureus&quot;, and are still used as first-line treatment. Methicillin was the first antibiotic in this class to be used (it was introduced in 1959), but only two years later, the first case of methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA) was reported in England.

Despite this, MRSA generally remained an uncommon finding, even in hospital settings, until the 1990s, when the MRSA prevalence in hospitals exploded, and it is now endemic. Now, methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (MRSA) is not only a human pathogen causing a variety of infections, such as skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI), pneumonia, and sepsis, but it also can cause disease in animals, known as livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA).

MRSA infections in both the hospital and community setting are commonly treated with non-β-lactam antibiotics, such as clindamycin (a lincosamine) and co-trimoxazole (also commonly known as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). Resistance to these antibiotics has also led to the use of new, broad-spectrum anti-Gram-positive antibiotics, such as linezolid, because of its availability as an oral drug. First-line treatment for serious invasive infections due to MRSA is currently glycopeptide antibiotics (vancomycin and teicoplanin). A number of problems with these antibiotics occur, such as the need for intravenous administration (no oral preparation is available), toxicity, and the need to monitor drug levels regularly by blood tests. Also, glycopeptide antibiotics do not penetrate very well into infected tissues (this is a particular concern with infections of the brain and meninges and in endocarditis). Glycopeptides must not be used to treat methicillin-sensitive &quot;S. aureus&quot; (MSSA), as outcomes are inferior.

Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic primarily used for treating Gram-positive bacterial infections, including those caused by Staphylococcus aureus. It was first approved in 2003 and is especially effective against resistant strains like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA).

Daptomycin works in a unique way compared to other antibiotics. It including calcium-dependent membrane binding, disruption of membrane potentia and bacterial cell death.Daptomycin is FDA-approved for treating complicated skin and soft tissue infections  and bloodstream infections and right-sided infective endocarditis caused by S. aureus.

Serum triggers a high degree of tolerance to the lipopeptide antibiotic daptomycin and several other classes of antibiotic.Serum-induced daptomycin tolerance is due to two independent mechanisms. The first one is the activation of the GraRS two-component system. The activation is triggered by the host defense LL-37. So that, bacteria can make more peptidoglycan to make the cell wall become thicker. This can make the tolerance of bacteria. The second one is the increase of cardiolipin abundance in the membrane.The serum-adapted bacteria can change their membrane composition. This change can reduce the binding of daptomycin to the bacteria’s membrane.

Because of the high level of resistance to penicillins and because of the potential for MRSA to develop resistance to vancomycin, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published guidelines for the appropriate use of vancomycin. In situations where the incidence of MRSA infections is known to be high, the attending physician may choose to use a glycopeptide antibiotic until the identity of the infecting organism is known. After the infection is confirmed to be due to a methicillin-susceptible strain of &quot;S. aureus&quot;, treatment can be changed to flucloxacillin or even penicillin, as appropriate.

Vancomycin-resistant &quot;S. aureus&quot; (VRSA) is a strain of &quot;S. aureus&quot; that has become resistant to the glycopeptides. The first case of vancomycin-intermediate &quot;S. aureus&quot; (VISA) was reported in Japan in 1996; but the first case of &quot;S. aureus&quot; truly resistant to glycopeptide antibiotics was only reported in 2002. Three cases of VRSA infection had been reported in the United States as of 2005. At least in part the antimicrobial resistance in &quot;S. aureus&quot; can be explained by its ability to adapt. Multiple two component signal transduction pathways helps &quot;S. aureus&quot; to express genes that are required to survive under antimicrobial stress.

==== Efflux pumps ====
Among the various mechanisms that MRSA acquires to elude antibiotic resistance (e.g., drug inactivation, target alteration, reduction of permeability) there is also the overexpression of efflux pumps. Efflux pumps are membrane-integrated proteins that are physiologically needed in the cell for the exportation of xenobiotic compounds. They are divided into six families, each of which has a different structure, function, and transport of energy. The main efflux pumps of &quot;S. aureus&quot; are the MFS (Major Facilitator Superfamily) which includes the MdeA pump as well as the NorA pump and the MATE (Multidrug and Toxin Extrusion) to which it belongs the MepA pump. For transport, these families use an electrochemical potential and an ion concentration gradient, while the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family acquires its energy from the hydrolysis of ATP.

These pumps are overexpressed by MDR &quot;S. aureus&quot; (Multidrug resistant &quot;S. aureus)&quot; and the result is an excessive expulsion of the antibiotic outside the cell, which makes its action ineffective. Efflux pumps also contribute significantly to the development of impenetrable biofilms.

By directly modulating efflux pumps&#x27; activity or decreasing their expression, it may be possible to modify the resistant phenotype and restore the effectiveness of existing antibiotics.

== Carriage ==

About 33% of the U.S. population are carriers of &quot;S. aureus&quot; and about 2% carry MRSA. Even healthcare providers can be MRSA colonizers.

The carriage of &quot;S. aureus&quot; is an important source of hospital-acquired infection (also called nosocomial) and community-acquired MRSA. Although &quot;S. aureus&quot; can be present on the skin of the host, a large proportion of its carriage is through the anterior nares of the nasal passages and can further be present in the ears. The ability of the nasal passages to harbour &quot;S. aureus&quot; results from a combination of a weakened or defective host immunity and the bacterium&#x27;s ability to evade host innate immunity. Nasal carriage is also implicated in the occurrence of staph infections.

== Infection control ==

Spread of &quot;S. aureus&quot; (including MRSA) generally is through human-to-human contact, although recently some veterinarians have discovered the infection can be spread through pets, with environmental contamination thought to play a relatively less important part. Emphasis on basic hand washing techniques are, therefore, effective in preventing its transmission. The use of disposable aprons and gloves by staff reduces skin-to-skin contact, so further reduces the risk of transmission.

Recently, myriad cases of &quot;S. aureus&quot; have been reported in hospitals across America. Transmission of the pathogen is facilitated in medical settings where healthcare worker hygiene is insufficient. &quot;S. aureus&quot; is an incredibly hardy bacterium, as was shown in a study where it survived on polyester for just under three months; polyester is the main material used in hospital privacy curtains.

The bacteria are transported on the hands of healthcare workers, who may pick them up from a seemingly healthy patient carrying a benign or commensal strain of &quot;S. aureus&quot;, and then pass it on to the next patient being treated. Introduction of the bacteria into the bloodstream can lead to various complications, including endocarditis, meningitis, and, if it is widespread, sepsis.

Ethanol has proven to be an effective topical sanitizer against MRSA. Quaternary ammonium can be used in conjunction with ethanol to increase the duration of the sanitizing action. The prevention of nosocomial infections involves routine and terminal cleaning. Nonflammable alcohol vapor in NAV- systems have an advantage, as they do not attack metals or plastics used in medical environments, and do not contribute to antibacterial resistance.

An important and previously unrecognized means of community-associated MRSA colonization and transmission is during sexual contact.

&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; is killed in one minute at 78 °C and in ten minutes at 64 °C but is resistant to freezing.

Certain strains of &quot;S. aureus&quot; have been described as being resistant to chlorine disinfection.

The use of mupirocin ointment can reduce the rate of infections due to nasal carriage of &quot;S. aureus.&quot; There is limited evidence that nasal decontamination of &quot;S. aureus&quot; using antibiotics or antiseptics can reduce the rates of surgical site infections.

==Research==
As of 2024, no approved vaccine exists against &quot;S. aureus&quot;. Early clinical trials have been conducted for several vaccines candidates such as Nabi&#x27;s StaphVax and PentaStaph, Intercell&#x27;s / Merck&#x27;s V710, VRi&#x27;s SA75, and others.

While some of these vaccines candidates have shown immune responses, others aggravated an infection by &quot;S. aureus&quot;. To date, none of these candidates provides protection against a &quot;S. aureus&quot; infection. The development of Nabi&#x27;s StaphVax was stopped in 2005 after phase III trials failed. Intercell&#x27;s first V710 vaccine variant was terminated during phase II/III after higher mortality and morbidity were observed among patients who developed &quot;S. aureus&quot; infection.

Nabi&#x27;s enhanced &quot;S. aureus&quot; vaccines candidate PentaStaph was sold in 2011 to GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A. The current status of PentaStaph is unclear. A WHO document indicates that PentaStaph failed in the phase III trial stage.

In 2010, GlaxoSmithKline started a phase 1 blind study to evaluate its GSK2392103A vaccine. As of 2016, this vaccine is no longer under active development.

Pfizer&#x27;s &quot;S. aureus&quot; four-antigen vaccine SA4Ag was granted fast track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February 2014. In 2015, Pfizer has commenced a phase 2b trial regarding the SA4Ag vaccine. Phase 1 results published in February 2017 showed a very robust and secure immunogenicity of SA4Ag. The vaccine underwent clinical trial until June 2019, with results published in September 2020, that did not demonstrate a significant reduction in Postoperative Bloodstream Infection after Surgery.

In 2015, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, a former division of Novartis and now part of GlaxoSmithKline, published promising pre-clinical results of their four-component &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; vaccine, 4C-staph.

In addition to vaccine development, research is being performed to develop alternative treatment options that are effective against antibiotic resistant strains including MRSA. Examples of alternative treatments are phage therapy, antimicrobial peptides and host-directed therapy.

===Standard strains===
A number of standard strains of &quot;S. aureus&quot; (called &quot;type cultures&quot;) are used in research and in laboratory testing, such as:

<text>Greenville is a city in the Lower Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. With a population 8,816 at the 2020 census, it is the most populous city in Montcalm County. The city was the birthplace of the Meijer superstore chain.

==History==
Greenville is named after its founder, John Green, who settled in the wilderness of the southwest part of Montcalm County in 1844. Green constructed a sawmill on the Flat River that is credited for attracting other settlers. The newly formed &quot;Green&#x27;s Village&quot; attracted many people of Danish origin who followed another early Danish settler&#x27;s positive letters home regarding the area. Because of the town&#x27;s heritage, Greenville celebrates the Danish Festival every year on the third weekend of August. A post office was established on January 20, 1848, with Abel French as the first postmaster. John Green had the village platted in 1853, and it was a station on the Detroit, Grand Rapids and Western Railroad. Greenville incorporated as a village in 1867 and as a city in 1871.

Hendrik Meijer, founder of Meijer&#x27;s stores, moved to Greenville after immigrating to the United States from the Netherlands. He was initially a barber, but the Great Depression and lack of a proper grocery on his side of town led him to open his own store in 1934. Meijer corporation now operates stores throughout the Midwest. Hendrik&#x27;s son Fred Meijer, principal architect of the modern Meijer chain, is a native son.

Greenville is home to the Fighting Falcon, the lead plane of a wave of gliders during World War II&#x27;s Operation Overlord. The &quot;Falcon&quot; was purchased with funds raised by the schoolchildren of the city, and was designated the lead aircraft in recognition of this achievement.

Since the foundation of Ranney Refrigerator Co. in 1892, the town has been known as the &quot;Refrigerator Capital of the World&quot;. It has also been home to the Gibson, White Consolidated, Frigidaire, and until recently, the Electrolux refrigerator factory. Electrolux closed the Greenville facility in early 2006, as it was in the process of relocating the factory to Ciudad Juárez in Mexico. This move impacted 2,700 employees and their families.

The city was to become the epicenter of &quot;green&quot; technology with the addition of solar panel manufacturer United Solar Ovonic; however, that enterprise filed for bankruptcy. It is also home to the new manufacturing and design center of Northland Marvel, an undercounter refrigeration company that just became a part of the UK-based AgaRangemaster group.

Lafayette Street, the downtown district, was placed on the National and State Register of Historic Places in November 2008.

==Geography==
Greenville is in southwestern Montcalm County, bordered nearly on all sides by Eureka Township and for a short distance to the north by Montcalm Township. It is by road southwest of Stanton, the Montcalm county seat, and northeast of Grand Rapids.

The Flat River passes through the city, flowing south to join the Grand River at Lowell. Greenville contains three navigable lakes within its city limits, Baldwin, Manoka, and Como. It also contains many unnamed ponds, a peat bog, and seasonal wet lands.

The Greenville post office, with ZIP code 48838, also serves all of Eureka Township, a large portion of Montcalm Township and a smaller area of Pine Township to the north, Fairplain Township to the east, a small area of Otisco Township in Ionia County to the south, and a large part of Oakfield Township to the west and a smaller part of Grattan Township to the southwest, both in Kent County.

It incorporated as a village in 1873. The post office name was shortened to &quot;Howard&quot; on February 2, 1895, but restored to Howard City on January 19, 1899.

The village&#x27;s Main Street was initially constructed on Ensley Street, which was named after early settler Benjamin Ensley. In 1883, however, many of the wooden buildings on Ensley Street burned down. Main Street was then shifted over to Edgerton Street, its present location. The Hudson Knife factory and the Skinner and Steenman sideboard factory were two of the earliest businesses. Later, Hudson Knife Co. went through changes and became the Joslin and eventually Olsen Knife Company, which had the somewhat famous jingle, &quot;Fatty Fatty run for your life, here comes Skinny with an Olsen Knife.&quot; Howard City schools were combined with Sand Lake schools to the south in 1962, and renamed Tri County, because students from Kent, Montcalm, and Newaygo counties all attended. The school still runs under the same moniker.

The district was a consolidation of the Sand Lake and Howard City school boards. It came into existence on April 3, 1962, the day members of those communities voted in favor of consolidating their schools. The consolidated schools began operation in fall 1962. Prior to the consolidation, Howard City High School served the community. Impetus for consolidation occurred when the State of Michigan adopted new standards for education which required school systems to spend additional funds. A former member of the school board of Sand Lake, Charles Northup, stated, &quot;Howard City was almost in the same predicament as us. We figured we would have a good school system coming together.&quot; Sand Lake was a community which sought consolidation due to the financial strain from meeting the new requirements.
