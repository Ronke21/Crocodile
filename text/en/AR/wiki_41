<text>Burnsville ( ) is a city south of downtown Minneapolis in Dakota County, Minnesota. The city is situated on a bluff overlooking the south bank of the Minnesota River, upstream from its confluence with the Mississippi River. Burnsville and nearby suburbs form the southern portion of Minneapolis–Saint Paul, the 16th-largest metropolitan area in the United States, with about 3.7 million residents. At the 2020 census the population was 64,317.

The name &quot;Burnsville&quot; is attributed to an early Irish settler and land owner, William Byrne. His surname was recorded as &quot;Burns&quot; and was never corrected.

Burnsville stands on land that once contained a village of Mdewakanton Dakota. Later, it became a rural Irish farming community. Burnsville became Minnesota&#x27;s 14th-largest city in the 2020 census following the construction of Interstate 35. Now the ninth-largest suburb in the metro area and a bedroom community of both Minneapolis and Saint Paul, it was fully built by the late 2000s. Burnsville&#x27;s downtown area is called &quot;Heart of the City&quot; with urban-style retail and condominiums. The Burnsville Transit Station serves as the hub and headquarters of the Minnesota Valley Transit Authority, providing regional bus service to five other suburbs.

Burnsville is home to a regional mall (Burnsville Center), a section of Murphy-Hanrehan Park Reserve, vertical ski peak Buck Hill, and part of the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge.

==History==
The Mdewakanton Dakota were the earliest inhabitants, arriving by the Minnesota River, following water fowl and game animals. Around 1750, as part of the greater migration of the Mdewakanton from their ancestral area around Mille Lacs Lake to the confluence of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers, Chief Black Dog established his band at a permanent village at the isthmus between Black Dog Lake (which is named after him) and the Minnesota River, near the present site of the Black Dog Power Plant. Early settlers reported the village&#x27;s population as over 250 Dakota. At the south end of Burnsville, Crystal Lake, recorded as &quot;Minne Elk&quot;, was used for fishing, leisure and burial. It was also a gathering spot where Dakota watched deer or bucks drink at the lake from the top of Buck Hill, which was named by early settlers who witnessed this activity. Three large burial mounds were discovered after European settlement.

The Dakota nation ceded land in 1851 and many relocated to Chief Shakopee&#x27;s village—the Shakopee-Mdewakanton Indian Reservation in nearby Prior Lake. The first European settlers were Irish, Scottish and Norwegian farmers who came upriver from Saint Paul. One of these was William Byrne, who had immigrated in 1840 from County Kilkenny, Ireland to Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. In 1855, he settled at the present-day junction of County Road 34 and Judicial Road near the Scott County line, just southeast of old downtown Savage. He subsequently donated land there for a church, school, and a cemetery, and served as town chairman. In 1858, the Dakota County Board authorized Byrnsville Township in the north by the Minnesota River, east by Eagan and Apple Valley, south by Lakeville, and west by Scott County. There is some ambiguity about whether the name actually derived from Byrne, since there were people with the surname &quot;Burns&quot; (a Scottish variant) living in the area. The town clerk recorded variations between &quot;Burns&quot; and &quot;Byrne&quot; but at the 1960s city incorporation, &quot;Burnsville&quot; prevailed. The school district was organized during this time as well. Burnsville originally comprised the present-day downtown of Savage (then known as Hamilton) until county border revisions by the legislature. Irish and Scottish settlers left their names on many area roads and parks and their religion in Presbyterian, Protestant, and Catholic churches.

In the 19th century, Burnsville was considered far from downtown Minneapolis. Rail access came in 1864 and Burnsville became a resort town, with cottages along Crystal Lake as well as Orchard Lake and Marion Lake in nearby Lakeville. The Bloomington Ferry provided river crossings until 1889 when the original Bloomington Ferry Bridge was built. By 1920, the Lyndale Avenue Drawbridge opened next to Black Dog Lake, extending Minneapolis&#x27;s first north-south highway to the rural communities of southern Minnesota. Later, the bridge, upgraded several times, was replaced by the I-35W Minnesota River bridge. In 1950, just before the World War II postwar housing boom, Burnsville was still a quiet township with a population of 583. School was taught in a one-room schoolhouse containing eight grades.

After the arrival of Interstate 35W in 1960, the next two decades saw the largest boom in population when postwar pressures forced the community to develop at rapid pace. Byrnesville Township was officially incorporated in 1964 after defeating an annexation attempt by the city of Bloomington. Mass housing development followed and former mayor Connie Morrison has said city managers had foresight in producing shopping nodes in walking distance of most homes. The city became a regional pull when Burnsville Center opened in 1977 and produced the heavily traveled retail strip on County Road 42. The next decades dealt with managing Burnsville&#x27;s increasing population and growth which led to providing alternative transportation options, diverse housing projects, and ultimately the &quot;Heart of the City&quot; project. The city approached build-out in the late 1990s and changed focus from new development to redevelopment and rehabilitation of existing structures.

Descendants of the Byrne family still remain in greater Minnesota with the original spelling in their surname. A relative who dedicated William Byrne Elementary in the 1960s considered petitioning to correct the spelling but most of the family had moved away for several decades.

==Geography==
Fed by receding glaciers and Lake Agassiz 12,000 years ago, the Glacial River Warren carved today&#x27;s Minnesota River valley. On Burnsville&#x27;s northern border, the Minnesota River winds through marshland and flood plains toward its confluence with the Mississippi. Most of the river is in the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge with fish, wildlife, and parkland managed collectively by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Burnsville also contains the Black Dog and Lower Minnesota River Watershed Districts, managed by the Dakota County Soil and Water Conservation District.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water.

Interstate Highway 35 splits into Interstate Highways 35W and 35E within the city. Other routes in the city include Minnesota Highway 13 and County Road 42.

==Demographics==
The earliest settlers were roughly 250 Mdewakanton Dakota who lived permanently at Black Dog camp. Starting in the 1850s, Old stock Americans from the east coast and French Canadians moved into eastern Dakota County near Saint Paul. A decade later, major European immigration began with settlers from Ireland, Scotland, and Great Britain. By the 1900s there were a few Scandinavians from Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, but these ethnic groups were mostly concentrated near Lakeville. Those from Germany and Eastern Europe gradually joined the minority from the packing jobs in nearby South St. Paul. Irish descendants maintained the majority through the early 1950s owing to the town&#x27;s origin, overall land ownership, and the practice of marrying within ethnic clans. The early 20th century&#x27;s permanent population remained very low as the Minnesota River&#x27;s lack of bridges and streetcar connection isolated the area from development, preventing people from moving south of the river. The lakeside houses around Crystal Lake and Orchard Lake attracted various immigrant and first-generation wealthier people to temporarily settle or own land in the town limits.

In 1960, the U.S. Census Bureau recorded the population of Byrnesville Township at 2,716 and soon after, the postwar growth was dramatic, filling the city with second- to third-generation European descendants from Minneapolis. From 1960 to 1970, the population rose to nearly 20,000 and by 2000, the population was roughly 60,000.

Service firms such as internet utilities, news, and real estate are mostly located throughout the north along Highway 13.

Retail shopping is along County Road 42 and Highway 13 in the west and east sections of the city with local shopping nodes positioned throughout. The largest strip, County Road 42, is lined with suburban strip malls, restaurants, goods and grocery stores. The anchor of the strip, Burnsville Center, is a regional mall.

Burnsville is a 15- to 30-minute drive from many regional attractions and services, such as the Mall of America, Valleyfair Amusement Park, Buck Hill Ski Area, the Minneapolis–St. Paul International Airport, downtown Saint Paul and downtown Minneapolis. Adjacent cities of Apple Valley, Bloomington, Eagan, Lakeville, and Savage provide even more shopping hubs, lakes and parks.

===Heart of the City===

Burnsville&#x27;s &quot;Heart of the City&quot; project is a downtown development policy driven by smart growth and new urbanism. The redevelopment encompasses in central Burnsville, a few miles south of the Minnesota River.

The 1150-seat postmodern Burnsville Performing Arts Center, now The Ames Performing Arts Center, opened in January 2009. Its approval in 2007 was controversial. Grande Market Square at Nicollet Avenue and Burnsville Parkway is the cornerstone of the Heart of the City project, and features a Doron Jensen-signature restaurant.
==Arts and culture==
The Ames Performing Arts Center is at 12600 Nicollet Avenue in the Heart of the City. The center has two theatres, a 1000-seat Proscenium Stage, and an art gallery.
The Garage located near City Hall is a nonprofit music club and teen center that has attracted music acts nationally and internationally.

Annually every August or September, the community holds the Burnsville Fire Muster. Established in 1980, the event originated in the 1970s as a showcase and short parade for a local fire equipment collector. Taking on the New England fire muster tradition, the event now includes a large parade, music concerts, and fireworks. In 2004, the Guinness Book of World Records cited the namesake event of this celebration, a fire truck parade, as the longest of its kind in the world at that time.

==Parks and recreation==

The city contains of parkland throughout 79 parks and is managed by the Burnsville Parks Department, which follows a Parks &amp; Trails Master Plan. Only a third is developed and for recreation, with the remainder preserved as natural habitat. Burnsville&#x27;s border with the Minnesota River is within the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Crystal Lake is the city&#x27;s major recreation lake, allowing boating, fishing, jet-skiing, and swimming. Burnsville Skate Park is a free facility during summer hours. Burnsville Ice Center has two large professional ice rinks.

Burnsville Athletic Club is an all-volunteer youth sports league. It has an annual participation of nearly 1,300 in the baseball leagues for grades K-12, 80–90 boys&#x27; basketball teams in grades 3–12, and over 400 in flag and tackle American football in grades 2–8. There are also traveling teams for boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; basketball, girls&#x27; fast pitch softball, and 8th grade boys&#x27; football, which play against similar teams from around the state at a higher competitive level. Other adult sports are provided through the city&#x27;s recreation department, other recreational organizations, and minor league groups.

Burnsville has over 58 playgrounds and roughly 11 recreational lakes. The most heavily used lakes are Keller Lake, Crystal Lake, Kruse Lake, and Aligmanet Lake (split with Burnsville&#x27;s neighbor Apple Valley, MN). In mid-2021, after finding numerous large goldfish in Keller Lake, Burnsville warned residents against public goldfish release, citing ecological concerns (goldfish are a regulated invasive species in Minnesota and their release into public waters is illegal).

==Government and politics==

Burnsville operates as a Statutory Plan B city under the Minnesota Legislature. Government consists of an elected city council of one executive mayor and four council members. All four council members are elected at-large to serve four-year terms. The mayor&#x27;s term was changed from two to four years in 2000. The city manager is in charge of administrative duties, including employment of the city. As one of many Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan municipalities, the city is required to regularly submit a Comprehensive Plan detailing infrastructure and development progress to the Metropolitan Council.

Elizabeth Kautz has been mayor since 1995, elected after serving two years on the city council, where she replaced Ken Wolf, who was elected to the State House of Representatives in District 41B. Having been reelected eight times, she has served for over 27 years. Kautz&#x27;s framework of progressive activity and financial management has been studied academically. She cites in her biography that she has reduced Burnsville&#x27;s debt, increased infrastructure improvement, maintained the scheduled property tax decrease, established a new youth center, and overseen the establishment of the Minnesota Valley Transit Authority.

One of Kautz&#x27;s major redevelopment projects was the Burnsville Heart of the City, the intersecting commercial areas near Burnsville Parkway and Nicollet Avenue. In the 2008 mayoral election, her opponent cited the 1,000-seat regional performing arts center component as misuse of public funds toward arts.

The city is in multiple districts in both the Minnesota Senate (51, 56) and Minnesota House (51A, 56A, 56B). Burnsville is represented in the State Senate by Jim Carlson (District 51, DFL) and Lindsey Port (District 56, DFL), and in the State House by Sandra Masin (District 51A, DFL), Jessica Hanson (District 56A, DFL), and Kaela Berg (District 56B, DFL).

Burnsville is in Minnesota&#x27;s 2nd congressional district and is represented by Angie Craig, a Democrat.

==Infrastructure==
Burnsville is a fully developed suburban bedroom community. Large pockets of ramblers and split-level houses were due to Interstate 35W&#x27;s completion in the 1960s which came earlier than most of the metro highways. Burnsville through the 1990s filled in the last of its available land with upscale housing stock and apartment complexes. In the 2000s Burnsville went under redevelopment activity, producing many four-story residential buildings. The &quot;Heart of the City&quot;, a new downtown area, contains mixed-use residential and retail buildings. This has produced a diverse range of housing types from single-family homes to high-density condominiums. Since the city was developed in a sprawl fashion, new and old buildings sit between each other. The original industrial area along the Minnesota River is mostly abandoned, and also contains a sealed land-fill site. The new industrial area in the west side of the city contains manufacturing and corporate headquarters. West of the new downtown area are new office buildings.

Since 2005, Burnsville has cut its carbon emissions by almost 30%, through changes such as energy efficiency, composting to reduce methane emissions from landfills, and improvements to water infrastructure.

County Road 42 and State Highway 13 both provide east–west access to the western suburb of Savage and the eastern suburbs of Eagan and Apple Valley. Major interior arteries include Nicollet Avenue, McAndrews Road (East 138th Street), County Road 5 (Kenwood Trail), County Road 11, Portland Avenue, Southcross Drive, and Lac Lavon Drive. The Dan Patch Corridor is planned to serve Burnsville.

===Utilities===

The hospital is within The Ridges campus which includes various medical clinics, services, centers and institutes. Nearby is a Park Nicollet Health Services.

===Law enforcement===
Burnsville&#x27;s law enforcement is provided by the Burnsville Police Department, which formed in July 1964 soon after the town&#x27;s incorporation. The department consists of 75 sworn officers and 19 civilian personnel. The current chief of police, as of May 10, 2019, is Tanya Schwartz. The department was the first in the state of Minnesota to introduce body-worn cameras to its officers in the summer of 2010 and rolled them out to all officers by the end of 2011. The department&#x27;s current police station was built in 1988 and is located at 100 Civic Center Parkway. The station underwent a major $13.3 million renovation starting in summer 2017, and the newly renovated station was re-opened in February 2018.

<text>Farmington is a city in Dakota County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 23,632 at the 2020 census. It is a part of the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area.

==History==

Settlers began arriving in Empire Township, in which Farmington grew, in the early 1850s. The village of Dakota City began around the intersection of the Minnesota Central, Hastings, and Dakota railroads, and the Vermillion River. The popular city train station in Dakota City was Farmington Station and non-residents began confusing the two names and identifying the town as Farmington. The town&#x27;s name was then permanently changed from Dakota City to Farmington. The present name was given for the numerous farms near the original town site. Farmington received its village charter in 1872, making it the second-oldest community in Dakota County after the county seat, Hastings.

A notable event in Farmington&#x27;s history is the movement of the Dakota County Fair to Farmington in 1869. Another event, the Great Fire of Farmington on November 22, 1879, destroyed several houses, stores, a hotel, and a grain elevator in the current downtown area. The fire was started by a firework cart that was knocked over in a buggy accident. Farmington High School graduated its first class in 1884. Farmington was one of the first communities in the United States to offer rural free mail delivery in 1897.

The town continued to grow throughout the 20th century. The city celebrated its centennial in 1972. Recently the city has expanded to include several suburban neighborhoods north of the original downtown. Farmington is still separated by Lakeville to the north and west by farms, but it continues to be incorporated in the expanding suburbs of the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area.

Farmington is home to three properties listed on the Register of Historic Places for Dakota County: the Daniel F. Akin House, the Church of the Advent, and the Exchange Bank Building.

==Economy==

<text>Inver Grove Heights is a city in Dakota County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 35,801 at the 2020 census. The city was formed on March 9, 1965, with the merger of the village of Inver Grove and Inver Grove Township.

It is one of 186 cities and townships in the seven-county Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area. Inver Grove Heights is southeast of Saint Paul; nearby communities are South St. Paul, West St. Paul, Sunfish Lake, Eagan, Newport, and Saint Paul Park (the last two across the Mississippi River).

==History==

After the signing of the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux in 1851, settlers from Ireland and Germany quickly staked claims in the rolling countryside west of the Mississippi River. Those of Irish descent farmed the eastern part of the community, while Germans cleared the wooded land to the west for their farms. French and English settlers built their homes along the river. The township of Inver Grove Heights was named after the Irish fishing village of Inver and the German town of Grove. Records show that 240 farms, four churches, and four school districts were founded by 1880. On March 9, 1965, the village of Inver Grove and Inver Grove Township merged to form Inver Grove Heights.

Historic sites in Inver Grove Heights include:
* Chief Medicine Bottle&#x27;s Village: formed in 1836, became Pine Bend village and post office
* Mendota-Wabasha Road: a military road laid out by John S. Potter in 1853. Rich Valley Road now follows the old military road.
* District 7 School: Dakota County&#x27;s first public school, established in 1854

<doc id="119900" wikidata="Q983776" url="?curid=119900" title="Lakeville, Minnesota">
<text>Lakeville is an exurb of Minneapolis-Saint Paul, and the largest city in Dakota County, Minnesota, United States. It is about south of both downtown Minneapolis and downtown St. Paul along Interstate 35. Lakeville was once a flourishing milling center; its agriculture industry and other major industries are still in operation. It is one of the fastest-growing cities in the Twin Cities area. The population was 69,490 at the 2020 census, making it Minnesota&#x27;s tenth-most populous city.

Lakeville first became notable in 1910 when Marion Savage built the Dan Patch Railroad Line to serve his Antlers Amusement Park. While many of Lakeville&#x27;s workers commute to Minneapolis, St. Paul, and more central suburbs like Bloomington, Lakeville has had major industry since the 1960s—including the Airlake Industrial Park, which is served by Airlake Airport, a regional reliever airport.

==History==
A military road was constructed between Fort Snelling and forts to the south. In 1855, J. J. Brackett, a Saint Paul lumber baron and mail carrier using the road, platted a site halfway between Saint Paul and Saint Peter on a lake he named Prairie Lake. The village was established as Lakeville Township in 1858. Notoriety came when Colonel Marion Savage expanded his entertainment business by constructing Antlers Amusement Park in 1910. Riding on fame from his success with the Dan Patch racing horse and the park&#x27;s popularity, the lake was renamed Lake Marion, and the rail line serving the park was named the Dan Patch Railroad Line.

With the mostly rural landscape, early settlers were farmers. A high proportion were Scandinavian. Other ethnic groups included Irish, Scots, and English, each of whom had spread out from Hamilton Landing and Burnsville. In Karen Miller&#x27;s diary from 1840 to 1895, Danes reportedly outnumbered Norwegians; travel to Minneapolis was not uncommon for the rural township. Enggren&#x27;s Grocery was a downtown staple from 1900 until it closed in 2006.

Lakeville&#x27;s development later in the 20th century followed a typical pattern for outer-ring Twin Cities suburbs. The town was officially incorporated as the City of Lakeville in 1967. It remained primarily agricultural, as postwar development did not immediately absorb Lakeville (and Interstate 35 had not yet been completed). In the early 21st century, housing and population increases were due to rising land costs in the metropolitan area, causing Lakeville to become a boomtown.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water. Lakeville includes the Argonne Farms post-World War I settlement project, which failed in the early 20th century and was redeveloped in the 21st century into typical suburban retail. Since it was a semi-autonomous village within Lakeville Township before the city&#x27;s incorporation, it continues to appear today on maps as Argonne.

A branch of the Vermillion River flows through Lakeville. Its headwaters are just west of the city limits in Credit River Township, and it flows eastward across Dakota County until it empties into the Mississippi River at the Wisconsin border. Much of Lakeville drains into the Vermillion River watershed. North Creek, a major tributary of the Vermillion, begins its flow in northern Lakeville and flows eastward to meet the Vermillion near downtown Farmington just east of Lakeville. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has designated the Vermillion River as a trout stream.

===Climate===
Lakeville&#x27;s climate is classified as warm-summer humid continental with features of a hot-summer humid continental (Köppen Dfa).

==Demographics==

===2010 census===
As of the census of 2010, there were 55,954 people, 18,683 households, and 15,158 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 19,456 housing units at an average density of .

==Economy==
Airlake Industrial Park, developed by Maynard Johnson with colleagues at Bloomington-based Hitchcock Industries, is home to as many as 200 companies and an estimated 4,500 employees. The 1,500-acre park, one of the state&#x27;s largest contiguous industrial parks, has attracted companies ranging from start-ups to large corporations.

Airlake Industrial Park was a contrived name: &quot;air&quot; represented the airport that Hitchcock Industries built on the grounds and &quot;lake&quot; signified Lake Marion.

Lakeville is served by the Airlake Airport, which has a single runway with an ILS approach. The Metropolitan Airports Commission manages the airport as a reliever facility to draw general aviation traffic. The FAA operates the Minneapolis ARTCC (air route traffic control center) in Farmington, several miles from the airport. This center provides traffic control services for Minnesota and surrounding states.

Large farms are still in operation, deriving most of their revenue from corn, soybeans, and dairy cattle.

Post Consumer Brands has had its headquarters in Lakeville since 2015.

==Parks and recreation==
Lakeville has many recreational opportunities. As of 2020, it has 3,021 acres of parks, recreation and preserves. The Parks &amp; Recreation Department maintains 62 public properties, including neighborhood and community parks, athletic fields, playgrounds, greenways, trails, tennis courts, skating rinks, picnic areas, conservation areas, nature areas, several public fishing areas, swimming beaches, the City&#x27;s Central Maintenance Facility, Senior Center, and the Lakeville Area Arts Center. Notable parks include Ritter Farm Park, North Park, Antlers Park, King Park, Valley Lake Park, and Aronson Park, which features a Veterans Memorial.

Antlers Park features a large swimming beach with volleyball courts, baseball diamonds, a playground area, water equipment, a picnic area, a fishing pier, and horseshoe pits. Orchard Lake Beach has a picnic area, shore fishing, playground equipment, and volleyball courts. Valley Lake Beach includes playground equipment, a picnic area, a walking trail around the lake, a fishing pier and seasonal restrooms.

==Government==
The city of Lakeville is governed by a five-member city council, including a mayor. A city administrator runs day-to-day municipal operations. A professional police force and volunteer fire department protect the city&#x27;s residents. The city operates a large parks department that includes a senior center, an entertainment center, dozens of various neighborhood and community parks, and many miles of multipurpose trails.

Luke Hellier is the mayor. The city is in Minnesota&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, represented since 2019 by Angie Craig. Lakeville is represented in the Minnesota Senate by District 57 Senator Zach Duckworth. In the Minnesota House, Lakeville is represented by District 57A Representative Jon Koznick and District 57B Representative Jeff Witte.

==Education==
Lakeville is served by three different school districts, whose boundaries were determined when the community was largely agricultural. Today Independent School District 196 (&quot;Rosemount-Apple Valley-Eagan&quot;) and Farmington School District 192 serve parts of northern and eastern Lakeville. Most Lakeville households are served by Lakeville Area School District 194. In 2005, the Lakeville School District opened its second high school, Lakeville South. Some students attend public schools in other school districts chosen by their families under Minnesota&#x27;s open enrollment statute. Lakeville North was a Blue Ribbon school of excellence in 2009. Each high school has nearly 2,000 students. There are eight public elementary schools and three public middle schools. Century Middle School students go on to attend Lakeville North, McGuire Middle School students go on to attend Lakeville South, and Kenwood Middle School students attend either, depending on their neighborhood of residence.

==Media==
* Lakeville &quot;Sun Thisweek&quot;
* &quot;Farm Show&quot; newspaper has been published in Lakeville since 1976

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Lakeville is directly served by Interstate 35, as well as Cedar Avenue/MN 77 to the east.

Before its abandonment in 1970, the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s Hastings and Dakota Subdivision ran through the center of Lakeville and served various industries. Short-line railroad Progressive Rail is based in Lakeville, and owns the right-of-way of the MN&amp;S Subdivision between Lakeville and Northfield. Between Lakeville and Savage the MN&amp;S Subdivision is owned by Canadian Pacific Railway, but it has been out of service since the 1990s. In 2009 Progressive Rail began using a segment of the out-of-service tracks for railcar storage, causing local controversy. The Dan Patch Corridor would go through Lakeville, but has been banned from discussion and funding by the Minnesota State Legislature since 2002. The City of Lakeville opposes public funding of a passenger rail line through the community on the MN and S Subdivision.

A previous City of West St. Paul, incorporated in the late 19th century, was situated in what is now called Saint Paul&#x27;s Lower West Side. According to the West 7th/Fort Road foundation, Saint Paul annexed the West Side, and was incorporated for two reasons: &quot;to aid law enforcement—criminals could escape Saint Paul authorities by crossing to the West Side and Dakota County—and to eliminate the Wabasha Street Bridge tolls which were inhibiting development on the West Side.&quot; The current West St. Paul split from the western half of South St. Paul, and was incorporated in 1889, just south of the city of Saint Paul. The population was 20,615 at the 2020 census, growing by 1,075 since 2010 census. West Saint Paul is known for its 2.5-mile retail strip along Robert Street.

<text>Claremont is a city in Dodge County, Minnesota, United States. Located along U.S. Highway 14, Claremont lies in southeastern Minnesota and is part of the Rochester metropolitan area. The city had a population of 513 according to the 2020 census. 

Founded in the mid-19th century, Claremont developed as a small agricultural hub, with its growth spurred by the arrival of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway. The city was incorporated in 1878 and has historically served the surrounding farming community, maintaining a modest population throughout its history. In 1990, Claremont’s school district merged with neighboring districts in Dodge Center and West Concord, forming the Triton Public Schools district. Today, Claremont retains its small-town character while offering essential services to residents and the surrounding rural area.

* Dodge County Road 1 and Dodge County Road 3 provide additional local access to surrounding areas. These roads are locally maintained by the Dodge County Highway Department.

While Claremont itself no longer has a rail line, the area was historically served by the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway, which helped to establish the city’s agricultural trading importance in the late 19th century. Rail access was crucial for the region’s economic development during that time.

Humidity levels are high during summer months and lower during the winter months.

===Seasonal Abnormalities===
* Summer thunderstorms can bring heavy rain and occasional tornadoes to the region. The area is located in Tornado Alley, so Claremont may experience tornado warnings during the summer months.
* Snowfall can be significant in winter, especially from November to March, with accumulation averaging around (76 cm) annually.
* Drought conditions can sometimes affect the area, although the climate generally provides adequate rainfall for agriculture.

===Political Geography===

Claremont is part of Minnesota Senate District 26 and House District 26B, both of which encompass other small towns and rural areas in southeastern Minnesota. The city is governed by a Mayor-Council system with the Mayor and City Council overseeing local policies.

===State of Industrial Development===
While Claremont is primarily a rural agricultural community, it benefits from the nearby Rochester metropolitan area, which is a hub of healthcare and biotechnology. The presence of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester provides significant economic benefits to surrounding areas, including Claremont. The local economy is supported by manufacturing, healthcare, and construction, with small-scale industrial activities and businesses contributing to the local economy.

==History==

===Development of the Area===
Claremont, located in southeastern Minnesota, was established in the mid-19th century. Its development was initially influenced by the area’s rich agricultural potential and its proximity to major transportation routes, including railroads and highways. The Chicago and North Western Railway played a crucial role in Claremont&#x27;s early economic development, helping to establish the city as a hub for agricultural trade. The city&#x27;s incorporation in 1878 formalized its role in the region, and it grew steadily as a small agricultural community, serving the surrounding farming population.

===Influence Exerted by Major Powers in Development===
The influence of major powers in Claremont’s development primarily came from the federal and state governments, which provided infrastructure, such as roads and railways, that facilitated the city’s growth. The Chicago and North Western Railway’s expansion across the Midwest further linked Claremont to regional markets, boosting its economy. The railroad era also helped shape the city’s early settlement patterns and economic structure. The broader agricultural policies of Minnesota also influenced the region, encouraging farming and rural development in the area.

===Divisions or Partitions Resulting from Wars and Treaties===
Claremont&#x27;s history has not been significantly shaped by wars or treaties. The area was originally inhabited by Indigenous peoples before being settled by European Americans in the mid-19th century. There are no specific historical records indicating significant partitions or divisions of the land due to wars or treaties, though the broader history of the United States’ westward expansion and settlement affected the development of communities like Claremont.

===Major Geographic or Political Factors to the Current Status of the Area===
The major geographic factors that have influenced Claremont’s development are its location within the Minnesota Prairie and southeastern Minnesota&#x27;s relatively flat and gently rolling terrain. The city is situated near the Zumbro River, which provides access to water resources, but it is not located directly on any major waterways or ports. Politically, Claremont is part of Dodge County, which provides governance and public services, while the city itself operates under a mayor-council system. The nearby city of Rochester, known for its healthcare and educational industries, has provided an economic and population draw for the area, influencing the city’s status and development.

===Present Form of Government and Previous Forms of Government===
Claremont currently operates under a mayor-council system, with an elected mayor and city council members overseeing local governance. The city was incorporated in 1878, and since that time, it has retained a small-town, locally-driven governance structure. While Claremont has always had an organized municipal government, the form has remained relatively unchanged over time. Prior to its incorporation, the town was governed by a combination of territorial and county oversight, typical of settlements in early Minnesota.

===Extent of Political Control Over Other Areas===
Claremont&#x27;s political control is confined to its own city limits and does not extend to neighboring municipalities or counties. It is part of the broader governance structure of Dodge County, which provides certain services and oversight for the region. The city&#x27;s government works alongside the county’s government to address broader issues such as regional transportation, infrastructure, and land-use policies, but Claremont has no formal control over adjacent areas.

===Degree of Control Over the Population Exercised by Government===
Claremont’s local government exercises a moderate degree of control over its population, largely through municipal ordinances, zoning regulations, and local law enforcement. The city has the authority to regulate land use, manage public infrastructure, and enact policies related to public safety, health, and welfare. However, because of its small size, Claremont’s governance is relatively minimal in its scope compared to larger urban areas.

===Susceptibility of Existing Government Toward Major Powers===
As a small town, Claremont’s government is subject to the influence of state and federal authorities, particularly in areas such as law enforcement, transportation, and economic policy. While the city exercises local governance, it is also subject to broader state-level regulations and federal policies that impact its development and services. The influence of larger powers like the state government of Minnesota and federal agencies is particularly felt in areas such as funding for infrastructure and education, where Claremont relies on state and federal support.

===Political Organization of the Area===
Claremont is situated within the political structure of Dodge County, which is governed by a five-member board of commissioners. The city is part of Minnesota’s Senate District 26 and House District 26B, which include other small towns and rural areas in southeastern Minnesota. Claremont’s mayor-council system provides local governance, while county and state governments oversee larger regional matters. The city’s governance is directly influenced by both local citizens and the broader political framework of Minnesota and the United States.

===Culture and Social Structure===

====History, Government, and Geography as They Affect the Cultural Makeup of the People====
Claremont’s culture is deeply influenced by its rural location, agricultural roots, and historical development as a small Midwestern town. The city has evolved from a primarily farming community to one that now benefits from its proximity to Rochester, which offers access to healthcare, education, and employment opportunities. These geographical and economic shifts have brought about a more diverse population and a gradual movement away from its agricultural roots, though farming remains important.

The government structure, with its Mayor-Council system, supports local community life, with a focus on maintaining a small-town atmosphere while adapting to external pressures from nearby metropolitan areas. Local events and community gatherings still play a significant role in Claremont’s social structure, as residents continue to engage in town meetings and volunteer for local causes.

The local culture has been shaped by the predominant religious beliefs in the area, with many residents belonging to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which has a significant influence on social life and values. Community traditions, such as local fairs and seasonal events, reflect the town’s agricultural heritage.

====Heroes and Leaders of Groups, with Reasons for Special Esteem====
Prominent figures in Claremont’s history include local leaders who have contributed to the city’s development and sense of community. The town has been shaped by civic-minded individuals, such as past mayors, council members, and community organizers, who have worked to improve local infrastructure, create public services, and strengthen the town’s economy. The presence of local heroes, including those involved in military service and civil rights efforts, continues to be celebrated by the community through public recognition and events.

====Ethnic Groups and Population Distribution====

The racial makeup of the city also includes small percentages of African American and Asian residents.

Claremont remains a rural town, and the distribution of people largely reflects a smaller, agricultural-focused economy.

The economy of Claremont is primarily supported by key industries, including health care and social assistance, manufacturing, and construction. As of recent data, health care employs the largest number of residents, with around 39 individuals working in various roles within this sector. Manufacturing provides employment to approximately 36 residents, while construction employs around 23 people.

The median household income in Claremont is estimated at $72,000, slightly below the state median, and the per capita income is $26,758. Approximately 19.7% of the population lives below the poverty line, which is higher than the state average.

The Claremont Economic Development Authority (EDA) actively supports local businesses and aims to attract new enterprises. The EDA offers a Façade Improvement Program, providing matching grants of up to $2,500 to enhance downtown aesthetics, and a Revolving Loan Program that offers low-interest loans to small and medium-sized businesses.

Claremont’s economy, while modest, plays an essential role in supporting the surrounding agricultural and rural community through these local programs and steady employment in its core sectors.

==Homesteading and Housing Opportunities==
Claremont, Minnesota, has a history of offering land incentives to encourage settlement and growth. While no active homesteading program is in place as of 2024, the city previously offered free land to eligible individuals under income qualifications to stimulate development.

In 2014, Claremont launched an initiative offering free residential lots to those willing to build homes, requiring a $1,000 administrative fee. However, despite these efforts, the program saw no participants.

In 2021, the city reintroduced similar efforts, offering land to households meeting specific income criteria. Again, these lots remained unclaimed.

Additionally, Claremont has partnered with Arden Home Services to offer affordable housing solutions. The city currently provides homes to low- to moderate-income working families, supporting the purchase of homes through USDA mortgages. Further information can be found on the city’s website.

==Education==
Historically, Claremont, Minnesota, operated its own school district, with Claremont High School proudly sporting the Parrot as its mascot. The school&#x27;s colors were orange and black, and it served the community’s educational needs until the district reorganization in 1990. In that year, Claremont&#x27;s school district consolidated with the neighboring districts of Dodge Center and West Concord, forming the Triton Public Schools district. This merger aimed to centralize resources and expand educational opportunities for students across the communities.

The newly established Triton district is headquartered in Dodge Center, which now houses the district’s three main schools:
* Triton Elementary School: Serving grades K–5, focused on foundational education and personal development.
* Triton Middle School: Serving grades 6–8, where students transition into more advanced academics and extracurricular activities.
* Triton High School: Covering grades 9–12, offering a comprehensive curriculum and competitive athletics.

The Triton mascot, the Cobra, represents the combined district, and the school colors are maroon and gray. The district’s first commencement exercises were held in 1991, and that year also marked the inaugural publication of the &quot;Triton Tradition&quot; yearbook.

===Athletics and Notable Achievements===
Triton High School has a strong athletic tradition, particularly in football. Under the leadership of Coach Don Henderson, Triton won the Minnesota State Football Championships in 1994 (B Division), 2000 (AA Division), and 2006 (AA Division). The 2006 team set a Minnesota State High School League Prep Bowl record for the highest score in a championship game (70 points) and for total combined points in a game (91 points).

Today, Triton Public Schools continues to serve the communities of Claremont, Dodge Center, and West Concord, fostering educational and athletic excellence within a unified district.

<text>Dodge Center is a city in Dodge County, Minnesota, United States. Approximately 15 miles west of Rochester, the population of Dodge Center was 2,670 at the 2010 census. Dodge Center is part of the Rochester, MN Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==


The Dodge Center area was first settled by pioneers in the 1850s. The town was created by the railroad system and named for its central location within Dodge County, Minnesota, which was named for Henry Dodge, twice the governor of Wisconsin.

The first train to reach Dodge Center arrived on July 13, 1866. Shortly after, D.L. Tyler moved to Dodge Center from Ashland (which had no railroad) and built its first general store in 1867. Tyler also became the town&#x27;s first postmaster.

Dodge Center&#x27;s site was officially platted in 1867 and recorded in July 1869. In January 1870, the legislature passed a bill changing the town&#x27;s name to Silas. The bill was reconsidered the next day and no further action was taken. The town remained Dodge Center and was incorporated in February 1872 by special act of the legislature.

Early Dodge Center was a farming community known for growing grain. Grain wagons lined up and down Main Street and into the surrounding countryside waiting their turn at either of two grain elevators.

By 1870, Dodge Center&#x27;s population had grown to 400–500. The two grain elevators, a gun shop, Tyler&#x27;s general store and The Kinney House (a hotel widely known in the region and later burned) had become established businesses. The Chicago and North Western Railroad depot had also been completed. Also by 1870, the one-room schoolhouse, in which a Mrs. Rice taught, had become too small. Realizing the importance of education, the people of Dodge Center built a wooden, L-shaped, two-story schoolhouse, costing about $15,000. The first high school commencement exercises were held in 1885.[2] When that school was also outgrown, a new brick building was constructed in 1898.

The 1870 school was cut in half and converted. One half became an opera house (where the Assembly of God church now stands) and the other half became apartments directly across the street. The opera house was one of the grandest in southeastern Minnesota, with a large stage, balcony and opera seats. The opera house eventually became a church and was destroyed by fire in 1948. The apartments were demolished in the 1980s.

The 1898 building, at the corner of 1st Ave NW and 3rd Street NW, was used until 1972. A gymnasium, auditorium and two classrooms were added in 1936, part of President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s WPA program. An addition containing a library and home-economics room was added in 1950 and an elementary school building was constructed in 1958. Of the 1890s portion of the building (demolished in 1972), one stairwell and a classroom still exist. The small 1898 portion and the 1936, 1950 and 1958 additions remain standing and are owned by a private entity (as of August 2007); they house apartments with several small businesses. A new high school was erected on the western edge of town in 1972 and is still in use.

Dodge Center&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Dodge Center Press&quot;, began publication in 1874. The &quot;Dodge Center Star&quot; was established in 1890 by Edgar Stivers. The two papers merged in 1936 to become the &quot;Dodge Center Star-Record&quot;.

Along with the Kinney House, the Windsor Hotel developed a fine reputation throughout the region. A third hotel, the Hartley House, was built just south of the Chicago Great Western station. It burned one night, killing a traveling female teacher.

Dodge Center&#x27;s first permanent doctor was Steven W. Ranson, who began practicing there in June 1870. He also opened a drug store in 1872. In 1875 Dr. James A. Garver, of Ohio, moved from Wasioja to Dodge Center, where he continued to live and practice the rest of his life.

The Joseph Garrison post of the Grand Army of the Republic was established with 22 charter members in 1885. Garrison was the second man from Dodge County to lose his life in the American Civil War. He died in Libby Prison of wounds suffered in the Battle of Bull Run.

A large three-story roller mill was built in 1887. It had a national reputation for the fine quality of its flour and won first prize at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair in 1893. The mill and its brand were later sold. It was later destroyed by fire.

The Minnesota and Northwestern Railroad came to Dodge Center in 1885, the name being changed to Chicago Great Western in 1892. The track ran from Minneapolis, MN to Oelwein, IA. The last section of track to be completed was the long trestle across the Zumbro River, north of Dodge Center.

Religion had an early start in Dodge Center. The Seventh Day Baptists organized in 1859 and the settlers erected a building in 1865. They moved it into the village of Dodge Center and dedicated it in 1873. Today, Dodge Center continues this seventh day tradition with the modern Dodge Center Seventh-day Adventist Church.

The Sunday Baptists built a church in 1874 in the southern part of the village. A tornado demolished the building in 1880.

The Methodist Church was constructed in 1878 and was used by the congregation until 1958 when it moved into the current building. The Congregational Church community began to move to Dodge Center from Wasioja, Minnesota in 1875.

==Education==

Dodge Center High School held its first commencement exercises in 1885. A new brick building opened in 1898 and was used until 1972. One stairwell and a classroom still exist from the original building. A gymnasium, auditorium and two classrooms (also still standing) were added in 1936, part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Works Progress Administration program. An addition containing a library and home-economics room was added in 1950 and an elementary school building was constructed in 1958. The entire structure is now owned by a private entity and houses apartments with several small businesses.

Dodge Center chose the name &quot;Dodgers&quot; as its nickname and mascot. School colors were maroon and gold until the 1930s, when they were changed to green and white. The first school annual, &quot;The Dodger Digest&quot;, was published in 1948. It later became known as the &quot;Centerite&quot;.

In 1990, Dodge Center&#x27;s school district merged with the towns of Claremont, MN and West Concord, MN to form Triton Public Schools. Dodge Center is now home to Triton Primary, Triton Middle School and Triton Senior High School. The first commencement exercises were held in 1991.

Triton&#x27;s school mascot is the Cobra. The school colors are maroon and gray. The annual yearbook is titled &quot;Triton Tradition&quot; and the first volume was published in 1991.

Triton High School was remodeled with an addition completed in 1998 that included an additional gymnasium and a new elementary school. A middle school was added in 2009. More additions to the school followed in 2012 as the Triton communities continued to grow.

Dodge Center is also home to the Maranatha Adventist Christian school, which serves students grades 1–8 in a modern facility near the Dodge Center Seventh-day Adventist Church.

==School athletics==

In 1952, the Dodge Center football team became one of six Minnesota high school teams to not allow a single point in a season.

The Triton Cobras, coached by Don Henderson, won the Minnesota State Football championship in 1994 (B Division), 2000 (AA Division) and in 2006 (AA Division). In 2006, Triton&#x27;s football team won every game in the AA Division. The 2006 Cobras hold a Minnesota State High School League Prep Bowl record for both the highest scoring team in a championship game (70 points), as well as total scoring game for both teams (91 points). Two members of the 1994 state championship team also hold individual Minnesota State High School League Prep Bowl records: Kirk Midthun (&#x27;96) for most touchdown passes (6) and Judge Gisslen (&#x27;95) for most touchdown receptions (4 -- record since tied). Kirk Midthun was voted the Associated Press Minnesota Player of the Year in 1994 and 1995 (a co-winner with Tim Rosga of Cretin Derham Hall).

The Triton athletic fields are named for former Dodge Center High School football coach, Wally Hitt.

Dodge Center also used to be on the Chicago Great Western mainline which ran south from St. Paul down through Iowa and across to Chicago, Illinois. However, the CGW right-of-way has since been abandoned. There were at least three train stations built in the town over the years. Two of these still exist, though they have been repurposed.

==Historic 1918 Kasson Public School==

Due to efforts of Kasson&#x27;s non-profit historic preservation group Kasson Alliance for Restoration (KARE) the 2012-era Kasson Public School building has officially been placed on the National Register of Historic Places. Kasson&#x27;s elementary and high school students began using the stately building on December 5, 1918. The school&#x27;s nomination to the National Register was approved on December 6, 2007, almost exactly 89 years later.

The school joins the Jacob Leuthold Jr. House, the Eureka Hotel the Kasson Municipal Building, and the Kasson Water Tower on the list of Kasson&#x27;s buildings on the National Register of Historic Places. 
KARE and the City of Kasson co-sponsored an Historic Properties Reuse Study to investigate ways to use the Kasson Public School building. The Reuse Study Report was published in October 2009. A citizen task force was formed in November 2009 and began meeting in January 2010 to investigate the adaptive reuses options outlined in the report which included a survey distributed to all of Kasson&#x27;s 5,000 citizens. 581 citizens responded. In May 2010 the Task Force presented the survey results to the City Council. 58% of the respondents favored rehabilitating/reusing the school. At a city council meeting in August 2010, Mayor Tim Tjosaas asked the council to form a Library Building Committee (LBC) composed of citizen volunteers; this was approved. The LBC began meeting in September 2010.

In February 2011 the LBC announced that they had met with Deb Parrott of the engineering and architecture firm Widseth, Smith, Nolting and Associates. Parrott, who has experience with library design, was asked to prepare three library design proposals for the historic school, as follows: 1) total rehabilitation of the 1918 school building, 2) a partial or modified rehabilitation of the school building and 3) a completely new structure on the general footprint of the existing building (after demolition of the 1918 school). KARE rejected all three proposals and the building sits vacant to this day.

==Festival==
Kasson is known for its annual Festival in the Park celebration in August, a volunteer-organized weekend with events celebrating the town&#x27;s heritage and bringing together members of the community. The festival began in 1991 and has continued to grow over the years, including traditional events like a parade, a fireworks display, and the &quot;Miss Kasson&quot; ceremony, which was recently changed to &quot;Kasson Ambassador,&quot; allowing men to take part. More recent events include a bellyflop contest, an eating contest, and a musical showcase. The festival takes place the second weekend in August every year at the North Park.

Most children in Alexandria attend school at Alexandria Public Schools, which consists of six kindergarten–5th grade elementary schools (Lincoln, Voyager, Woodland, Carlos, Miltona, Garfield), one 6th–8th grade junior high school (Discovery Middle School), and one new 9th–12th grade senior high school (Alexandria Area High School), which replaced Jefferson High School, which was built in the late 1950s. There are also several independent K–8 Christian schools in the area.

==Media==
===Newspaper===
&quot;Alexandria Echo Press&quot; is Alexandria&#x27;s twice-weekly newspaper, owned by the Forum Communications Company.

===Television===
From 1958 until 2012, Alexandria had at least one local television station, either KCCO or KSAX, and both are still satellites of Minneapolis, MN television stations. KCCO had a presence, first as KCMT, in 1958, as an NBC and ABC affiliate. It switched to CBS affiliation in 1982. Five years later, KSAX regained ABC&#x27;s presence as a semi-satellite of KSTP-TV. In that same year, KCCO was bought out and became a semi-satellite of WCCO-TV. In 1992, KCCO became a CBS O&amp;O when CBS acquired WCCO and its two satellites.

During KCCO and KSAX&#x27;s time as semi-satellites, they broadcast local news, weather, and sports through ten-minute cut-in segments during their parent station&#x27;s newscast. In 2002, KCCO removed its local presence and became a full satellite of WCCO. In June 2012, cost-cutting measures at KSAX resulted in the layoff of all but two employees and the ending of local cut-in broadcasts by any Alexandria television station.

The Alexandria area is also served by Selective TV, Inc., a non-profit, viewer-supported organization which transmits several cable channels free-to-air over standard UHF television frequencies, viewable in any area home without subscription. Selective TV operates under low power television rules of the FCC and as such was not subject to the analog to digital conversion in 2009. Residents still need a converter box to view KCCO and KSAX on the digital band, though KSAX is still rebroadcast via Selective TV.

A 2018 article in &quot;The Oregonian&quot; described Alexandria as &quot;conservative-leaning&quot;.

<text>Queen Anne&#x27;s War (1702–1713) or the Third Indian War was the second in a series of French and Indian Wars fought in North America involving the colonial empires of Great Britain, France, and Spain; it took place during the reign of Anne, Queen of Great Britain. In the United States, it is regarded as a standalone conflict under this name. Elsewhere it is usually viewed as the American theater of the War of the Spanish Succession. In France, it was known as the Second Intercolonial War.

The war was primarily a conflict between French, Spanish and English colonists for control of the North American continent while the War of the Spanish Succession was being fought in Europe. Each side was allied with various Indigenous communities. It was fought in four fronts. 

In the south, Spanish Florida and the English Province of Carolina attacked one another, and English colonists engaged French colonists based at Fort Louis de la Louisiane (near present-day Mobile, Alabama), with Indigenous bands allied on each side. The southern war did not result in significant territorial changes, but it resulted in seriously decimating the Indigenous population of Spanish Florida and parts of southern Georgia, with destruction of the network of Spanish missions in Florida.

In New England, English colonists and Indigenous allies fought against French colonists and their Indigenous forces, especially in Acadia and unsettled border frontier with Canada. Quebec City was repeatedly targeted by British colonial expeditions, and the British captured in 1710 the Acadian capital Port Royal. French colonists and the Wabanaki Confederacy sought to thwart British expansion into Acadia, whose border New France defined as the Kennebec River in what is now southern Maine. They executed raids in the Province of Massachusetts Bay (including Maine), most famously the Raid on Deerfield in 1704 and one on Groton in 1707, in both cases taking numerous captives to Montreal and Kahnawake (a Mohawk mission village) for ransom or adoption by Mohawk families.

In Newfoundland, English colonists based at St. John&#x27;s disputed control of the island with the French colonists of Plaisance, present-day Placentia. Most of the conflict consisted of economically destructive raids on settlements. The French colonists successfully captured St. John&#x27;s in 1709, but the British colonists quickly reoccupied it after the French abandoned it.

French privateers based in Acadia and Plaisance captured many ships from New England&#x27;s fishing and shipping industries. Privateers took 102 prizes into Plaisance, second only to Martinique in France&#x27;s American colonies. The naval conflict ended with the British capture of Acadia (Nova Scotia).

The Treaty of Utrecht ended the war in 1713, following a preliminary peace in 1712. France ceded the territories of Hudson Bay, Acadia, and Newfoundland to Britain while retaining Cape Breton Island and other islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Some terms were ambiguous in the treaty, and the concerns of various Indigenous communities were not included, thereby setting the stage for future conflicts.

==Background==

When war broke out in Europe in 1701 following the death of the last Hapsburg monarch, Charles II, European powers disputed the succession. The zone of conflict was initially restricted to a few powers in Europe, but it widened in May 1702 when England declared war on Spain and France. Both the English and French wanted to keep their American colonies neutral, but they did not reach an agreement. The American colonists had their own tensions which had been growing along the borders separating the French and English colonies. They were concerned about boundaries and governing authority in the northern and southwestern frontiers of the English colonies, which stretched from the Province of Carolina in the south to the Province of Massachusetts Bay in the north, with additional colonial settlements or trading outposts on Newfoundland and at Hudson Bay.

The total population of the English colonies was about 250,000, with Virginia and New England dominating. The colonists were concentrated along the coast, with small settlements inland, sometimes reaching as far as the Appalachian Mountains. Colonists knew little of the interior of the continent to the west of the Appalachians and south of the Great Lakes. This area was dominated by numerous historic Indigenous communities, although French and English traders had penetrated it. Spanish missionaries in &quot;La Florida&quot; had established a network of missions in an effort to convert the Indigenous to Roman Catholicism and focus their labor. The Spanish population was relatively small (about 1,500), and the Indigenous population to whom they ministered has been estimated at 20,000.

French explorers had located the mouth of the Mississippi River, and they established a small colonial presence at Fort Maurepas near Biloxi, Mississippi, in 1699. From there, they began to build trade routes into the interior, establishing friendly relations with the Choctaw, a large community whose enemies included the English-allied Chickasaw. All of these populations had suffered to some degree from the introduction of infectious diseases such as smallpox, endemic among early explorers and traders. The Native Americans had no immunity and suffered high mortality.

The arrival of French colonists in the south threatened existing trade links that Carolina colonists had established into the interior, creating tension among all three powers. France and Spain, allies in this conflict, had been on opposite sides of the recently ended Nine Years&#x27; War. Conflicting territorial claims between Carolina and Florida south of the Savannah River were overlaid by animosity over religious divisions between the Roman Catholic colonists of New Spain and the Protestant English colonists along the coast.

To the north, the conflict held a strong economic component in addition to territorial disputes. Newfoundland was the site of a British colony at St. John&#x27;s and a French colony at Plaisance, with both sides also holding a number of smaller permanent settlements. The island also had many seasonal settlements used by fishermen from Europe. These colonists numbered fewer than 2,000 English and 1,000 French permanent settlers (and many more seasonal visitors), who competed with one another for the fisheries of the Grand Banks, which were also harvested by fishermen from Acadia (then encompassing all of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick) and Massachusetts.

The borders and boundaries remained uncertain between Acadia and New England despite battles along the border throughout King William&#x27;s War. New France defined the border of Acadia as the Kennebec River in southern Maine. There were Catholic missions at Norridgewock and Penobscot and a French settlement in Penobscot Bay near Castine, Maine, which had all been bases for attacks on New England settlers migrating toward Acadia during King William&#x27;s War. The frontier areas between the Saint Lawrence River and the primarily coastal settlements of Massachusetts and New York were still dominated by Indigenous peoples, primarily Abenaki in the east and Iroquois west of the Hudson River. The Hudson River–Lake Champlain corridor had also been used for raiding expeditions in both directions in earlier conflicts. The threat of Indigenous peoples had receded somewhat because of reductions in the population as a result of disease and the last war, but they still posed a potent threat to outlying settlements.

The Hudson Bay territories (also known as Prince Rupert&#x27;s Land) were not significantly fought over in this war. They had been a scene of much dispute by competing French and English companies starting in the 1680s, but the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick left France in control of all but one outpost on the bay. The only incident of note was a French attack on the outpost of Fort Albany in 1709. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company was unhappy that Ryswick had not returned its territories, and it successfully lobbied for their return in the negotiations that ended this war.

==Technology and organization==
The colonial military technology used in North America was not as developed as in Europe. Only a few colonial settlements had stone fortifications at the start of the war, such as St. Augustine, Florida, Boston, Quebec City, and St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, although Port Royal&#x27;s fortifications were completed early in the war. Some villages and settlements were protected by wooden palisades, but many had little more than fortified wooden houses with gun ports through which defenders could fire, and overhanging second floors from which they might fire down on attackers trying to break in below.

Europeans and colonists were typically armed with smooth-bore muskets that had a maximum range of about but were inaccurate at ranges beyond half that distance. Some colonists also carried pikes, while Indigenous warriors either carried arms supplied by the colonists or were armed with weapons such as primitive tomahawks and bows. A small number of colonists had training in the operation of cannon and other types of artillery, which were the only effective weapons for attacking significant stone or wooden defenses.
English colonists were generally organized into militia companies, and their colonies had no regular military presence beyond a small number in some of the communities of Newfoundland. The French colonists were also organized into militias, but they also had a standing defense force called the &quot;troupes de la marine&quot;. This force consisted of some experienced officers and was manned by recruits sent over from France, numbering between 500 and 1,200. They were spread throughout the territories of New France, with concentrations in the major population centers. Spanish Florida was defended by a few hundred regular troops; Spanish policy was to pacify the Indigenous peoples in their territory and not to provide them with weapons. Florida held an estimated 8,000 Indigenous peoples before the war, but this was reduced to 200 after English colonist raids made early in the war.

==Course of the war==
===Carolina and Florida===

Prominent French and English colonists understood at the turn of the 18th century that control of the Mississippi River would have a significant role in future development and trade, and each developed visionary plans to thwart the other&#x27;s activities. French Canadian explorer Pierre Le Moyne d&#x27;Iberville had developed a &quot;Project sur la Caroline&quot; in the aftermath of the previous war which called for establishing relationships with Indigenous peoples in the Mississippi watershed and then leveraging those relationships to push the English colonists off the continent, or at least limit them to coastal areas. In pursuit of this grand strategy, he rediscovered the mouth of the Mississippi (which had first been found by La Salle in 1670) and established Fort Maurepas in 1699. From this base and Fort Louis de la Mobile (founded in 1702), he began to establish relationships with the local Choctaw, Chickasaw, Natchez people, and other communities.

English colonial traders and explorers from Carolina had established a substantial trading network across the southeastern part of the continent that extended all the way to the Mississippi. Its leaders had little respect for the Spanish in Florida, but they understood the threat posed by the French arrival on the coast. Both Carolina governor Joseph Blake and his successor James Moore articulated visions of expansion to the south and west at the expense of French and Spanish interests.

Iberville had approached the Spanish in January 1702 before the war broke out in Europe, recommending that the Apalachee warriors be armed and sent against the English colonists and their allies. The Spanish organized an expedition under Francisco Romo de Uriza; it left Pensacola, Florida in August for the trading centers of the Carolina back country. The English colonists had advance warning of the expedition and organized a defense at the head of the Flint River, where they routed the Spanish-led force, and captured or killed some 500 Spanish-led Indigenous peoples.

Carolina&#x27;s Governor Moore received notification concerning the hostilities, and he organized and led a force against Spanish Florida. 500 English colonial soldiers and militia and 300 Indigenous peoples captured and burned the town of St. Augustine, Florida in the Siege of St. Augustine (1702). The English were unable to take the main fortress and withdrew when a Spanish fleet arrived from Havana. In 1706, Carolina successfully repulsed an attack on Charles Town by a combined Spanish and French amphibious force sent from Havana.

The Apalachee and Timucua of Spanish Florida were virtually wiped out in a raiding expedition by Moore that became known as the Apalachee massacre of 1704. Many of the survivors of these raids were relocated to the Savannah River where they were confined to reservations. Raids continued in the following years consisting of large Indigenous forces, sometimes including a small number of white men; this included major expeditions directed at Pensacola in 1707 and Mobile in 1709. The Muscogee (Creek), Yamasee, and Chickasaw were armed and led by English colonists, and they dominated these conflicts at the expense of the Choctaw, Timucua, and Apalachee.

===Acadia and New England===

Throughout the war, New France and the Wabanaki Confederacy thwarted New England expansion into Acadia, whose border New France defined as the Kennebec River in southern Maine. In 1703, Michel Leneuf de la Vallière de Beaubassin commanded a few French Canadians and 500 Indigenous peoples of the Wabanaki Confederacy, and they led attacks against New England settlements from Wells to Falmouth (Portland, Maine) in the Northeast Coast Campaign. They killed or captured more than 300 settlers.

There were also a series of raids deep into New England by French and Indigenous forces aimed at securing captives. There was an active trade in captives, as families and communities struggled to raise ransoms to reclaim them. In February 1704, Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville led 250 Abenaki and Caughnawaga Indians (mostly Mohawk) and 50 French Canadians in a raid on Deerfield in the Province of Massachusetts Bay. They destroyed the settlement, killing many and capturing more than 100 captives. These were taken on an overland journey hundreds of miles north to the Caughnawaga mission village south of Montreal. Most of the children who survived the journey were adopted by Mohawk families. Several adults were later redeemed (ransomed) or released in negotiated prisoner exchanges, including the minister, John Williams, who tried for years without success to ransom his daughter Eunice. She became fully assimilated, marrying a Mohawk man. Likewise in August 1704, there was a raid in Marlborough (in the part of town to later become Westborough), from which captives were also taken to Caughnawaga. There was an active slave trade of the captive colonists during these years, and communities raised funds to ransom their citizens from Indigenous captivity. For instance a captured boy, Ashur Rice, was returned to Marlborough after he was ransomed in 1708 by his father Thomas Rice.

New England colonists were unable to effectively combat these raids, so they retaliated by launching an expedition against Acadia led by the famous Indigenous fighter Benjamin Church. The expedition raided Grand Pré, Chignecto, and other settlements. French accounts claim that Church attempted an attack on Acadia&#x27;s capital of Port Royal, but Church&#x27;s account of the expedition describes a war council in which the expedition decided against making an attack.

Father Sébastien Rale was widely suspected of inciting the Norridgewock community against the New Englanders, and Massachusetts Governor Joseph Dudley put a price on his head. In the winter of 1705, Massachusetts dispatched 275 militiamen under the command of Colonel Winthrop Hilton to seize Rale and sack the village. The priest was warned in time, however, and escaped into the woods with his papers, but the militia burned the village and church.

French and Wabanaki Confederacy continued making raids in northern Massachusetts in 1705, against which the New England colonists were unable to mount an effective defense. The raids happened too quickly for defensive forces to organize, and reprisal raids usually found tribal camps and settlements empty. There was a lull in the raiding while leaders from New France and New England negotiated the exchange of prisoners, with only limited success. Raids by Indigenous peoples persisted until the end of the war, sometimes with French participation.

In May 1707, Governor Dudley organized an expedition to take Port Royal led by John March. However, 1,600 men failed to take the fort by siege, and a follow-up expedition in August was also repulsed. In response, the French developed an ambitious plan to raid most of the New Hampshire settlements on the Piscataqua River. However, much of the Indigenous support needed never materialized, and the Massachusetts town of Haverhill was raided instead. In 1709, New France governor Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil reported that two-thirds of the fields north of Boston were untended because of French and Indigenous raids. French–Indigenous war parties were returning without prisoners because the New England colonists stayed in their forts and would not come out.

In October 1710, 3,600 British and colonial forces led by Francis Nicholson finally captured Port Royal after a siege of one week. This ended official French control of the peninsular portion of Acadia (present-day mainland Nova Scotia), although resistance continued until the end of the war. Resistance by the Wabanaki Confederation continued in the 1711 Battle of Bloody Creek and raids along the Maine frontier. The remainder of Acadia (present-day eastern Maine and New Brunswick) remained disputed territory between New England and New France.

===New France===
The French in New France&#x27;s heartland of Canada opposed attacking the Province of New York. They were reluctant to arouse the Iroquois, whom they feared more than they did the British colonists and with whom they had made the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701. New York merchants were opposed to attacking New France because it would interrupt the lucrative Indigenous fur trade, much of which came through New France. The Iroquois maintained their neutrality throughout the conflict, despite Peter Schuyler&#x27;s efforts to interest them in the war. (Schuyler was Albany&#x27;s commissioner of Indians.)

Francis Nicholson and Samuel Vetch organized an ambitious assault against New France in 1709, with some financial and logistical support from the queen. The plan involved an overland assault on Montreal via Lake Champlain and a sea-based assault by naval forces against Quebec. The land expedition reached the southern end of Lake Champlain, but it was called off when the promised naval support never materialized for the attack on Quebec. (Those forces were diverted to support Portugal.) The Iroquois had made vague promises of support for this effort, but successfully delayed sending support until it seemed clear that the expedition was going to fail. After this failure, Nicholson and Schuyler traveled to London accompanied by King Hendrick and other sachems to arouse interest in the North American frontier war. The Indigenous delegation caused a sensation in London, and Queen Anne granted them an audience. Nicholson and Schuyler were successful in their endeavor: the queen gave support for Nicholson&#x27;s successful capture of Port Royal in 1710. With that success under his belt, Nicholson again returned to England and gained support for a renewed attempt on Quebec in 1711.

The plan for 1711 again called for land and sea-based attacks, but its execution was a disaster. A fleet of 15 ships of the line and transports carrying 5,000 troops led by Admiral Hovenden Walker arrived at Boston in June, doubling the town&#x27;s population and greatly straining the colony&#x27;s ability to provide necessary provisions. The expedition sailed for Quebec at the end of July, but a number of its ships foundered on the rocky shores near the mouth of the Saint Lawrence in the fog. More than 700 troops were lost, and Walker called off the expedition. In the meantime, Nicholson had departed for Montreal overland but had only reached Lake George when word reached him of Walker&#x27;s disaster, and he also turned back. In this expedition, the Iroquois provided several hundred warriors to fight with the English colonists, but they simultaneously sent warnings to the French about the expedition, effectively playing both sides of the conflict.

===Newfoundland===

Newfoundland&#x27;s coast was dotted with small French and English communities, with some fishing stations occupied seasonally by fishermen from Europe. Both sides had fortified their principal towns, the French at Plaisance on the western side of the Avalon Peninsula, the English at St. John&#x27;s and in Conception Bay (see Carbonear Island). During King William&#x27;s War, d&#x27;Iberville had destroyed most of the English communities in 1696–97, and the island again became a battleground in 1702. In August of that year, an English fleet under the command of Commodore John Leake descended on the outlying French communities but made no attempts on Plaisance. During the winter of 1705, Plaisance&#x27;s French governor Daniel d&#x27;Auger de Subercase retaliated, leading a combined French and Mi&#x27;kmaq expedition that destroyed several English settlements and unsuccessfully besieged Fort William at St. John&#x27;s. The French and their Indigenous allies continued to harass the English throughout the summer and did damages to the English establishments claimed at £188,000. The English sent a fleet in 1706 that destroyed French fishing outposts on the island&#x27;s northern coasts. In December 1708, a combined force of French, Canadian, and Mi&#x27;kmaq volunteers captured St. John&#x27;s and destroyed the fortifications. They lacked the resources to hold the prize, however, so they abandoned it, and St. John&#x27;s was reoccupied and refortified by the English in 1709. (The same French expedition also tried to take Ferryland, but it successfully resisted.)

English fleet commanders contemplated attacks on Plaisance in 1703 and 1711 but did not make them, the latter by Admiral Walker in the aftermath of the disaster at the mouth of the St. Lawrence.

==Peace==

In 1712, Britain and France declared an armistice, and a final peace agreement was signed the following year. Under terms of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht, Britain gained Acadia (which they renamed Nova Scotia), sovereignty over Newfoundland, the Hudson Bay region, and the Caribbean island of St. Kitts. France recognized British suzerainty over the Iroquois and agreed that commerce with Indigenous peoples farther inland would be open to all nations. It retained all of the islands in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, including Cape Breton Island, and retained fishing rights in the area, including rights to dry fish on the northern shore of Newfoundland.

By the later years of the war, many Abenakis had tired of the conflict despite French pressures to continue raids against New England targets. The peace of Utrecht, however, had ignored Indigenous interests, and some Abenaki expressed willingness to negotiate a peace with the New Englanders. Governor Dudley organized a major peace conference at Portsmouth, New Hampshire (of which he was also governor). In negotiations there and at Casco Bay, the Abenakis objected to British assertions that the French had ceded to Britain the territory of eastern Maine and New Brunswick, but they agreed to a confirmation of boundaries at the Kennebec River and the establishment of government-run trading posts in their territory. The Treaty of Portsmouth was ratified on July 13, 1713, by eight representatives of some of the communities of the Wabanaki Confederacy; however, it included language asserting British sovereignty over their territory. Over the next year, other Abenaki tribal leaders also signed the treaty, but no Mi&#x27;kmaq ever signed it or any other treaty until 1726.

==Consequences==
===Acadia and Newfoundland===

The loss of Newfoundland and Acadia restricted the French presence on the Atlantic to Cape Breton Island. French were resettled there from Newfoundland, creating the colony of Île-Royale, and France constructed the Fortress of Louisbourg in the following years. This presence plus the rights to use the Newfoundland shore resulted in continued friction between French and British fishing interests, which was not fully resolved until late in the 18th century. The economic effects of the war were severe in Newfoundland, with the fishing fleets significantly reduced. The British fishing fleet began to recover immediately after the peace was finalized, and they attempted to prevent Spanish ships from fishing in Newfoundland waters, as they previously had. However, many Spanish ships were simply reflagged with English straw owners to evade British controls.

The British capture of Acadia had long-term consequences for the Acadians and Mi&#x27;kmaq living there. Britain&#x27;s hold on Nova Scotia was initially quite tenuous, a situation on which French and Mi&#x27;kmaq resistance leaders capitalized. British relations with the Mi&#x27;kmaq after the war developed in the context of British expansion in Nova Scotia and also along the Maine coast, where New Englanders began moving into Abenaki lands, often in violation of previous treaties. Neither the Abenakis nor the Mi&#x27;kmaq were recognized in the Treaty of Utrecht, and the 1713 Portsmouth treaty was interpreted differently by them than by the New England signatories, so the Mi&#x27;kmaq and Abenakis resisted these incursions into their lands. This conflict was increased by French intriguers such as Sébastien Rale, and eventually they developed into Father Rale&#x27;s War (1722–1727).

British relations were also difficult with the nominally conquered Acadians. They resisted repeated British demands to swear oaths to the British crown, and eventually this sparked an exodus by the Acadians to Île-Royale and Île-Saint-Jean (present-day Prince Edward Island). By the 1740s, French leaders such as Father Jean-Louis Le Loutre orchestrated a guerrilla war with their Mi&#x27;kmaq allies against British attempts to expand Protestant settlements in peninsular Nova Scotia.

Friction also persisted between France and Britain over Acadia&#x27;s borders. The boundaries were unclear as laid out by the treaty, which even the French had never formally described. France insisted that only the Acadian peninsula was included in the treaty (modern Nova Scotia except Cape Breton Island) and that they retained the rights to modern New Brunswick. The disputes over Acadia flared into open conflict during King George&#x27;s War in the 1740s and were not resolved until the British conquest of all French North American territories in the Seven Years&#x27; War.

===New England===
Massachusetts and New Hampshire were on the front line of the war, yet the New England colonies suffered less economic damage than other areas. Some of the costs of the war were offset by the importance of Boston as a center of shipbuilding and trade, combined with a financial windfall caused by the crown&#x27;s military spending on the 1711 Quebec expedition.

===Southern colonies===
Spanish Florida never really recovered its economy or population from the effects of the war, and it was ceded to Britain in the 1763 Treaty of Paris following the Seven Years&#x27; War. Indigenous peoples who had been resettled along the Atlantic coast chafed under British rule, as did those allied to the British in this war. This discontentment flared into the 1715 Yamasee War that posed a major threat to South Carolina&#x27;s viability. The loss of population in the Spanish territories contributed to the 1732 founding of the Province of Georgia, which was granted on territory that Spain had originally claimed, as was also the case with Carolina. James Moore took military action against the Tuscaroras of North Carolina in the Tuscarora War which began in 1711, and many of them fled north as refugees to join their linguistic cousins the Iroquois.

The economic costs of the war were high in some of the southern English colonies, including those that saw little military activity. Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania to a lesser extent, were hit hard by the cost of shipping their export products (primarily tobacco) to European markets, and they also suffered because of several particularly bad harvests. South Carolina accumulated a significant debt burden to finance military operations.

===Trade===
The French did not fully comply with the commerce provisions of the Treaty of Utrecht. They attempted to prevent English trade with remote Indigenous communities, and they erected Fort Niagara in Iroquois territory. French settlements continued to grow on the Gulf Coast, with the settlement of New Orleans in 1718 and other (unsuccessful) attempts to expand into Spanish-controlled Texas and Florida. French trading networks penetrated the continent along the waterways feeding the Gulf of Mexico, renewing conflicts with both the British and the Spanish. Trading networks established in the Mississippi River watershed, including the Ohio River valley, also brought the French into more contact with British trading networks and colonial settlements that crossed the Appalachian Mountains. Conflicting claims over that territory eventually led to war in 1754, when the French and Indian War broke out.

<text>Blue Earth is a city in Faribault County, Minnesota, United States, at the confluence of the east and west branches of the Blue Earth River. The population was 3,174 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Faribault County. It is home to a statue of the Jolly Green Giant. Additionally, Interstate 90 is centered on Blue Earth, as the east and west construction teams met here in 1978. As a tribute, there is a golden stripe of concrete on the interstate near Blue Earth. This draws an analogy to the golden spike set in the first transcontinental railroad. Approximately three miles south of Blue Earth is the Blue Earth Municipal Airport.

==History==
Blue Earth was platted in 1856. The city took its name from the Blue Earth River which surrounds the town. The river was given the Dakota language name (meaning &quot;blue earth&quot;) for the blue-green clay found in the river banks, from the phrase : &quot;the river where blue earth is gathered&quot;.

A post office has been in operation at Blue Earth since 1856.

The city celebrated its sesquicentennial in the summer of 2006 with community events, including a concert headlined by Peter Noone of Herman&#x27;s Hermits.

==Attractions and community achievements==

The Jolly Green Giant statue attracts over 14,000 visitors a year. In July 2007, the Blue Earth City Council approved space for a Green Giant memorabilia museum. In 2018 a building was built across from the Giant statue to house the museum, the Chamber and tourism offices, and the building is also the welcome center. Lowell Steen, of Blue Earth, has collected thousands of Green Giant items and will permanently loan them to the museum.

Steinberg Nature Park is a 33-acre (13.35 ha) park located east of Blue Earth on County Road 16. The park has a half-mile (0.8 km) trail and a picnic shelter.

Prior to football playoffs the &quot;Minneapolis Star Tribune&quot; had a Coaches Poll who voted each week for the Best Football Team in the State. In 1964, 1965 and 1966, the Blue Earth High School Bucs were rated #1 for 3 consecutive years holding many of their opponents to negative total yards. In 1972, the football team went 9-1 and played in the first state football playoffs and lost. The 1990 football team finished third in Minnesota for Class A. On November 24, 2012, the 2012 football team won the division 3A championship by defeating Rochester Lourdes High School by a score of 30–7.

The Blue Earth Bucs high school wrestling program has the second-most individual state champions on record in Minnesota with 50.

On Sept. 10–12, 1999, The Order of the Arrow (OA), a group within the Boy Scouts of America, held its Section C-1A Conclave in Blue Earth. Seven OA Lodges, representing councils from Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, attended the event.

==Architecture==
Blue Earth is home to many examples of Midwestern architecture, including:
Faribault County Courthouse – completed in December 1892 at a cost of over $70,000. The architect for the courthouse was C.A. Dunham of Burlington, Iowa and the contractor was S.J. Hoban from St. Paul. The style of the courthouse is Richardsonian Romanesque. Stone used in the construction of the courthouse was transported from Kasota, Minnesota to Blue Earth by horse and wagon and rail. Most of the sand used in the mortar was from the Blue Earth river bottom and thoroughly washed. The pillars on the front of the building are of polished granite. There are ledges on all four sides of the tower that are of solid stone of unknown weights of several ton each.

Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd – 1872

First Presbyterian Church — constructed in 1897 at a cost of $12,622.75. Designed by Kinney and Orth, architects from Austin, Minnesota. The architecture is Romanesque Revival in the arched windows, Gothic Revival in the steeples and gables, and medieval in the towers.

==History==
Winnebago was originally called Winnebago City, and under the latter name was laid out in 1856.

The first rail service came to Winnebago in 1871, when the Southern Minnesota Railroad completed it&#x27;s line to the town. Winnebago was the western terminus of the line until 1878, when it was extended to the west, reaching the state border at Airlie in 1880. That same year, the Southern Minnesota Railroad was absorbed into the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (CMStP&amp;P), more commonly known as the Milwaukee Road.

Besides farming they operate low-tech businesses, that produce and sell furniture, baskets, rugs, quilts, jams, baked goods and cashew crunch.

<doc id="120021" wikidata="Q4953105" url="?curid=120021" title="BpNichol">
<text>Barrie Phillip Nichol (30 September 1944 – 25 September 1988), known as bpNichol, was a Canadian poet, writer, sound poet, editor, creative writing teacher at York University in Toronto and grOnk/Ganglia Press publisher. His body of work encompasses poetry, children&#x27;s books, television scripts, novels, short fiction, computer texts, and sound poetry. His love of language and writing, evident in his many accomplishments, continues to be carried forward by many.

==Work==
Nichol was born in Vancouver, British Columbia. Though his early writing consisted of fiction and lyrical poems, he first received international recognition in the 1960s for concrete poetry. The first major publications included &quot;Journeying &amp; the returns&quot; (1967), a purple box containing visual &amp; lyrical poems and &quot;Konfessions of an Elizabethan Fan Dancer&quot; (1969) a book of concrete poetry. He won the 1970 Governor General&#x27;s Award for poetry with four publications: the prose booklet &quot;The True Eventual Story of Billy the Kid&quot; a collection of lyrical poems, &quot;Beach Head&quot;, the boxed concrete sequence, &quot;Still Water&quot; and &quot;The Cosmic Chef&quot;, a boxed anthology of concrete and visual poetry.

His best known work, &quot;The Martyrology&quot; (1972–1992) is an open-ended, lifelong poem that investigates language. The &#x27;saints&#x27; are drawn from &#x27;st&#x27; words (storm becomes St. Orm) and their spiritual quest provides a springboard from which linguistic issues of textuality, reading and writing are explored.

Nichol frequently collaborated with other artists. The work of the sound poetry group, The Four Horsemen (Nichol, Rafael Barreto-Rivera, Paul Dutton and Steve McCaffery) has been documented in Volcano Theatre&#x27;s stage performances of The Four Horsemen Project (Dora Mavor Moore Award 2007 &amp; 2015). He collaborated with Steve McCaffery to form The Toronto Research Group (TRG), with Barbara Caruso, visual artist, with R. Murray Schafer, Howard Gerhard and John Beckwith, composers.

Nichol&#x27;s zest for publishing other writers was reflected in founding Ganglia Press with David Aylward in 1964 and grOnk in 1967 with Aylward, Rob Hindley-Smith and David UU ( David W. Harris). He was a volunteer editor at Coach House Books from 1975 to his death. In 1978, he was one of the collective that established Underwhich Editions which edited, designed, published and distributed the works of worthy writers. During the 1970s and 80s, he was a contributing editor of Open Letter, a literary magazine.

Nichol also had a large presence on screens of various sizes. In the mid-1980s, he became a writer for the children&#x27;s television show, &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;, created by Jim Henson. Soon, scriptwriting for other children&#x27;s television shows followed: &quot;The Raccoons&quot;, &quot;Under the Umbrella Tree&quot;, &quot;Care Bears&quot; and &quot;Babar&quot;. Several films include bp and his work, starting with Michael Ondaatje&#x27;s short film, &quot;Sons of Captain Poetry&quot;; Ron Mann&#x27;s &quot;Poetry in Motion&quot; followed by &quot;&quot;, directed by Brian Nash, and more recently, Justin Stephenson&#x27;s award-winning film, &quot;The Complete Works&quot;. He died in Toronto, Ontario, five days shy of his 44th birthday. Since his death, there has been an upsurge of interest in &quot;First Screenings&quot;, Nichol&#x27;s 1984 computer poem (updated by Jim Andrews and his team) which has been part of electronic exhibitions from Mexico to Oakville.

== Therafields ==
Barrie Nichol / bpNichol was also a central figure in the psychoanalytic community Therafields, from the early 1960s into the early 1980s, with his formal resignation as vice-president of the organization in 1982. Nichol dedicates &quot;The Martyrology&quot; to the founder, Lea Hindley-Smith, “for lea / without whose act of friendship / quite literally none of this would have been written’ (14) and the work makes many references to Therafields, Lea, the Annex, and Mono Mills, where the organization owned multiple properties, and some named individuals. Nichol “underwent personal therapy” in 1963” with Lea, and he is credited with stating, ”In my case, I think therapy literally saved my life” (Scobie 18).

==Commemoration==

The bpNichol Chapbook Award,
a prize for poetry publications between 10 and 48 pages, was established in 1986 by Phoenix Community Works Foundation. This annual award for excellence in Canadian Poetry in English is now administered by Meet the Presses collective.

A street in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, is named in his honour. bpNichol Lane is located near Huron and Sussex Streets beside Coach House Books. It features an eight-line poem by Nichol carved into the pavement: &quot;A / LAKE / A / LANE / A / LINE / A / LONE&quot;.

==Recognition==
Lanesboro received the Great American Main Street Award in 1998. Author John Villani named the community one of the 100 Best Small Art Towns in America. It has also been rated one of the &quot;50 Best Outdoor Sports Towns&quot; by &quot;Sports Afield&quot; magazine.

Most recently, &quot;Outside Magazine&quot; featured the community as one of the &quot;20 Best Dream Towns in America&quot;.

==Art and culture==
Since 1989, Lanesboro has been home to the Commonweal Theatre Company, a professional ensemble dedicated to celebrating the human condition through actor-based storytelling. Each year, the Commonweal offers 4-6 plays ranging from Ibsen to family-friendly entertainment to holiday classics. During the summer months, two plays run in repertory, giving visitors the opportunity to see two different shows during their stay. The Commonweal, in cooperation with area businesses and organizations, hosts an annual Ibsen Festival celebrating Norwegian art and culture through workshops, lectures, food, and featuring Commonweal&#x27;s production of an Ibsen play. A live one-hour radio show, &quot;Over the Back Fence,&quot; is broadcast each Sunday evening from the theater during the summer months with tickets sold at the door. On July 7, 2007, the Commonweal opened a new theater facility called The Commonweal. This $3.5 million home seats 191 patrons in a thrust auditorium with an exterior designed to complement historic Lanesboro. The interior design was coordinated by area artist Karl Unnasch with regional elements such as reclaimed barn stone and lumber, cement floors and a permanent installation of area objects.

The Lanesboro Arts Council and Cornucopia Art Center merged to create Lanesboro Arts in 2010. Their gallery building, in downtown Lanesboro, features a spacious juried sales gallery and a traveling exhibition gallery, both of which showcase the work of more than 100 individual regional artists to more than 20,000 visitors annually, some as far as Saudi Arabia, Korea, China, Israel and Kenya. The St. Mane Theater is owned and operated by Lanesboro Arts, and is right next door to the Commonweal, giving Lanesboro a bonafide Theater District. It&#x27;s the home to several community theater productions throughout the year, as well as the Over the Back Fence community variety show (monthly from March through November), and other performing arts events and independent film screenings.

In 2013 Artplace America named Lanesboro one of the top twelve “small town artplaces” in the nation. The designation is based on the concentration of arts organizations, arts-oriented businesses and creative occupations.

During the first August, the popular &quot;Buffalo Bill Days&quot; is held, celebrating one of Lanesboro&#x27;s famous frequent visitors, Buffalo Bill. As the town&#x27;s tourist popularity grows, more festivals and get-togethers are being added to the town&#x27;s busy schedule of events.

In 2008, the governor of Minnesota declared Lanesboro the Rhubarb Capital of Minnesota. The first weekend in June Lanesboro hosts a Rhubarb Festival. In 2007, Garrison Keillor broadcast A Prairie Home Companion from the Lanesboro softball field and featured stories and songs about rhubarb.

<text>Peterson is a city in Fillmore County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 199 at the 2010 census.

==History==
In the year 1853, Peter Peterson Haslerud purchased and platted the village site of Peterson and was the major force behind its early growth and development. The community was named after him. After buying the land and platting the town, he was elected to the Minnesota State Legislature, served in several appointed positions and in 1856 was appointed by the Governor of Minnesota as Immigration officer for the 14th District of Minnesota. Peter was instrumental in bringing the railroad through Rushford Township in 1867 and he gave the railroad company fifteen acres of land and along with other citizens contributed $800. to secure a station and warehouse at Peterson. Peter began buying wheat from local farmers and shipping it back to the eastern part of the U.S.

In 1870, a post office was established in Peterson and Even A. Hjelie was appointed first postmaster. In 1871, Peter Peterson Haslerud developed a &quot;trout farm&quot; on his property outside Peterson and continued to expand the boundaries of the town.

In 1873, Ole Ensberg started a blacksmith shop and in 1874 an additional quarter section of land was laid out into lots and added to the village of Peterson. In 1875, two general stores, a hardware store, and a drug store were established. In 1875, the telegraph was installed at the railroad station and G.P. Haslerud (Peter Peterson Haslerud&#x27;s oldest son) was appointed agent. Also in that year fifteen additional acres were platted and Prospect Park, Mill, Centennial, Fillmore, Church, and Myrtle Streets were named. In 1876, a mill was built with farmers living in the surrounding areas subscribing most of the stock. A livery barn, a steam mill, the Peterson Hotel, the Northwestern Bar and other small businesses opened for business.

In 1882, the Minnesota and Dakota Gazetteer, gave a contemporary description of Peterson:

&quot;An unincorporated village of 100 inhabitants in Rushford Township, northeastern part of Fillmore County, and a station on the Southern Minnesota Railroad, 25 miles from Preston and 120 miles from Minneapolis. It is situated on the Root Rover which furnishes power to a flour mill at this point. A steam flour mill is also in operation in the village and there is a Lutheran church and district school. The exports are flour and wheat. Modes of communication are: Western Union Telegraph, American Express, two stages semi-weekly from Pilot Mound to Peterson via Arendahl and daily mail service.&quot;
Peterson was organized as a village in 1909.

== Founder of  Peterson- Peter Peterson Haslerud ==

Born  July 21, 1828, in Rollag Parish. Numedal, Norway,  Peter was the son of Peter Knutsen Haslerud ( 1775- 1847) and Ingveborg Pedersdr Bole (1785- 1843).  Very little is known about his early years, or that of his family  however records show he  emigrated  to the  United States at age 14 on  May 14, 1843 with his sister Ragnild and  her husband Gullick O. Laugen.  Their  ship &quot;Hercules&quot; set sail  with 55 passengers from Norway and arrived in New York  ninety seven days later.  

There were many reasons for the emigrations from Norway  to the United States in the 1800s  but economics  and/or religion usually played a big part and we don&#x27;t know that of Peter Haslerud but we do know that one of the first churches in the village he founded was based on the  principles of  Hans Nielsen Hauge  (see Wikipedia&#x27;s entry on Hauge).

After early years in Wisconsin and  Illinois (where he met and married Cornelia Aslaksdtter Anderson Teigen (born October 1, 1824- died April 15, 1892). the year 1853 brought Peter to the land that  eventually became the town of Peterson, which is named after him.    He plated and planned the village- seeing that schools and churches were built, naming streets and parks, establishing grain elevators and trout farms. The  Trout Farm, or Trout Hatchery, has provided trout to stock Minnesota&#x27;s lakes for over 150 years and is now operated by the State of Minnesota.   By 1874 the hatchery supplied at least 100,000 yearling trout  to stock waters for fishing.

Prior to 1874 Peter secured  hundreds of acres of land in Fillmore County, Minnesota, was responsible for getting a railroad depot for Peterson, brought many businesses to Peterson, served in the Minnesota legislature, was appointed to several governmental positions  and contributed to the culture and economy of Fillmore County as well as Peterson.

According to &quot;The Peterson Book-1974&quot; written and compiled by Ann Rislove and  John Ericson ( now curator at Peterson Museum) businesses in Peterson in 1912  run by Peter&#x27;s family members include Agrimson and Ensberg- General Merchandise,  Moen  Furniture, Carl Smaby- Peterson Hearld Editor and Owner,  Peterson Hardware, A,G, Haselrud, G.P. Haselrud and J.O. Ensberg- owners and operators of  the French Burr Mill Factory, O.A.O. Moen -Mortician, Carl Johnson- City Band,  Carl R. Moen- photographer.  J,O, Ensberg was founder and owner of the factory  and held several patents for original design of  factory machinery and  products.

First Structure in  Peterson

The  first structure in Peterson is Peter&#x27;s  home,  The original house had a living room, kitchen and two bedrooms.  Over the years as the family grew many more bedrooms were added and also , a second kitchen (called a &quot;summer kitchen&quot;.), a music room (with a pipe organ imported from Europe,) extra large screened porches around two sides of the home, a much larger dining room and a second &quot;sitting room&quot;  Sometime through the years the home came to be called &quot;House of seven gables&quot; and was occupied by Peter and his descendants until the year  2003.

Peter lived in the  home from its origin in  1853 until his death in  September 1880, his wife Cornelia died there in  April 1892.  Daughter Ingebord (Mary, Maria) born in 1858 lived in the family home  with her family until her death in 1934; her children  owned and occupied the home until  the year 2003.  

Peter  and Cornelia had five children:
:Son- George Peterson Haselerud  (1852-1923) who married Gunhild (Julia) Maria Wethe in Peterson on May 4, 1876
:Son-Andrew Peterson Haselerud  (1855-1942)  who married  Gjertrud (Jane) . Ensberg on September 28,  1878
:Daughter-Ingebord (Mary/Maria) Peterson Haselerud  (1858-1934) -married Johannes  Olson Engsberg on 9/28/1878
:Daughter- Ann Cornelia  Peterson Haselerud ( 1860-1863)
:Daughter- Adeline  Peterson Haselerud   (1862- 1933) who married Elmer Halverson on September 1, 1883.

<text>Preston is a city and the county seat of Fillmore County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 1,325 at the 2010 census. The Root River runs through it, and Mystery Cave State Park is nearby. It bills itself as &quot;America&#x27;s Trout Capital,&quot; with a 20-foot trout placed along Minnesota State Highway 16.

==History==
Preston was platted in 1855. The community was named for Luther Preston, a millwright and postmaster. The old Preston grain elevator used to be known as the Milwaukee Elevator Company Grain Elevator. It was built around 1890 for holding grain for shipment by railroad to the Eastern cities of the United States. The elevator was last used in the 1980s. It was built with &quot;cribbed&quot; construction, which has to do with interlocking bins. At the time it was a lot stronger and a lot more expensive to build it this way than to build it in stud construction. Now the Preston Historical Society is trying to restore the structure.
The Preston Overlook was built in 1937 by the Minnesota Department of Highways under the program of Federal Relief Construction during the New Deal. A site was chosen on the highest point on the bluffs above the Root River, 90 feet below. The Preston Overlook was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.

<text>Rushford is a city in Fillmore County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 1,860 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The first pioneers pole-boated up the Root River to the junction of Rush Creek, peering through 10-foot tall grasses to see what astonishing beauty the bluff lands had to offer. The early settlers gave Rushford its name on Christmas Day in 1854, during a chicken supper hosted by Capt. Dyer. The name stems from the nearby Rush Creek, which had tall Rushes growing along its banks. The area was once referred to as “Trail City” because seven Indian trails met at the creek. The Wieser Brothers were said to be the first founders of the city and quickly followed by hundreds.

Rushford has had a post office in operation since 1856, and the 1867 two-story Railroad Depot still stands at its original site, being restored as a Visitors Center for the local area.

As a result of the 2007 Midwest flooding, the city was flooded when Rush Creek overtopped the dikes. Rushford&#x27;s spirit bounced back to produce a very bustling and thriving community..

==Geography==

Rushford is located in southeastern Minnesota&#x27;s Bluff Country, part of the driftless area. Magelssen&#x27;s Bluff, a 440-foot hill directly over the town, has the town name written in large white letters on the side of the hill.

Minnesota Highways 16, 30, and 43 are three of the main routes in the city.

==Recreation==
Every five years, Rushford holds a citywide Homecoming celebration, with a standing invitation to all former residents of the city to return and visit. The town also hosts an annual celebration formerly called &quot;Frontier Days,&quot; now called &quot;Rushford Days.&quot;

Rushford is one of several towns intersected by the Root River segment of the Blufflands State Trail, a Rails to Trails project linking several small towns along 42 miles of the former railroad grade. The historic Rushford Depot (pictured to the right) is a landmark along this trail, with a museum inside the old depot and other historic buildings on the grounds.

<text>Albert Lea ( ) is a city in Freeborn County, in southern Minnesota. It is the county seat. Its population was 18,492 at the 2020 census.

The city is at the junction of Interstates 35 and 90, about south of the Twin Cities. It is on the shores of Fountain Lake, Pickerel Lake, Albert Lea Lake, Goose Lake, School Lake, and Lake Chapeau. Fountain Lake and Albert Lea Lake are part of the Shell Rock River flowage.

The city&#x27;s early growth was based on agriculture, farming support services and manufacturing, and it was a significant rail center. At one time it was the site of Cargill&#x27;s headquarters. Other manufacturing included Edwards Manufacturing (barn equipment), Scotsman Ice Machines, Streater Store fixtures, and Universal Milking Machines. As in many U.S. cities, Albert Lea&#x27;s manufacturing base has substantially diminished. A major employer was the Wilson &amp; Company meatpacking plant, later known as Farmstead and Farmland. This facility was destroyed by fire in July 2001.

==History==
The city is named after Albert Lea Lake, which was named after Albert Miller Lea, a topographer with the United States Dragoons, who surveyed southern Minnesota and northern Iowa in 1835, including the current site of Albert Lea. Captain Nathan Boone, a son of Daniel Boone, was the scout for Lea&#x27;s unit.

The city received national attention in 1959 after Local 6 of the United Packinghouse Workers of America went on strike against Wilson &amp; Co., one of the Big Four meatpacking plants at the time, over issues involving mandatory overtime requirements. When Wilson &amp; Co. attempted to operate the plant with replacement workers, violence erupted and split the town. During the 109-day strike, Governor Orville Freeman acted to quell the violence by closing the plant, calling in the Minnesota National Guard, and declaring martial law on December 11. A federal district court in Minneapolis ruled against Freeman on December 23, and the plant turned back to Wilson &amp; Co. just days later.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Albert Lea has a humid continental climate of the hot-summer subtype (Köppen &quot;Dfa&quot;). Albert Lea varies from cold winters to hot summers, with significant contrasts between seasons.

An exception to this rule is the urban core of Minneapolis - St. Paul, which sees higher temperatures typical of an urban heat island, but Albert Lea is significantly warmer than locations such as Duluth.

For several years, Freeborn&#x27;s summertime population would grow to approximately 450, due to the presence of the Jewish Chabad-Lubavitch Yeshiva summer camp, headquartered in the town&#x27;s former K-12 school building, as well as the adjacent 8-acre campus. This camp brought nearly 150 boys to town, as well as camp counselors and educational staff, primarily from the Crown Heights area of the borough of Brooklyn, in New York City. The camp operated for several years, and discontinued after the 2014 season.

Of the 136 households, 23.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 59.5% were married couples living together, 4.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 32.8% were non-families. 28.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.33 and the average family size was 2.81.

== Town newspaper ==
Freeborn has a small newspaper, known as &#x27;The Freeborn Frisbee&#x27;, which is produced quarterly, and appears in newsletter form. Founded in 1998, the paper contains informative articles and stories of local interest, generally about residents and the history of Freeborn. Among the regular features have been columns entitled &quot;A View from the Point,&quot; an essay of observations on and near Hanson&#x27;s Point, along the western shore of Freeborn Lake, and &quot;From the Mayor&#x27;s Desk,&quot; a chronicle of City Council matters of local interest. The Frisbee is produced and edited by Bonnie Schuster, a longtime local resident and historian.

===Freeborn Area Heritage Society===
The Freeborn Area Heritage Society is a local organization devoted to preserving and celebrating Freeborn&#x27;s history. The Society maintains the picturesque District 15 School, a one-room schoolhouse, originally constructed in 1858 on a site 3 miles south of town. It was relocated to a city park in November, 2006, and rededicated on June 14, 2007, during the Freeborn Area Sesquicentennial. Restored by the Society, the building is filled with classroom items and historic exhibits, reflecting the years between 1858 and 1937, during which the school was in operation.

Immediately adjacent to the school, a newly-constructed Museum building contains a large and varied assortment of community and local artifacts, displayed around the Museum&#x27;s two prized centerpieces: the Freeborn Fire Department&#x27;s vintage 1946 fire truck, and a carefully-restored 1928 Model T Ford, purchased new from a Freeborn automobile dealer that year. The Model T, which remained in the family of the original owner for over 80 years, was generously donated to the community, and, along with the fire truck, remains on permanent display at the Museum.

The Museum also features records, yearbooks, and regalia from the former Freeborn High School, which closed in 1987, as well as the FHS athletic teams, the Freeborn Yeomen. This nickname was unique to Freeborn; no other high school in America is known to have had the Yeomen mascot; the school&#x27;s colors were orange and black. There are also trophies from FHS&#x27;s many successful athletic teams, competing in the Border League and Southern Minny Conferences, as well as voluminous records from their years in those athletic conferences.

== FFA Corn Drive ==
FFA Corn Drives for Camp Courage first began in 1964, originating that year with the Freeborn High School Chapter of the Future Farmers of America, or FFA. During the initial Corn Drive that year, members of the Freeborn FFA chapter walked acres of newly-harvested fields of area farmers, picking up ears of corn left behind by the machinery. The corn was collected and sold, and the proceeds were given to Camp Courage, a northern Minnesota summer camp for special-needs children. The first Corn Drive raised $87. Freeborn High School teacher and FFA advisor Lee Asche was instrumental in starting this enterprise, and promoting it statewide. In tribute to his generous spirit and charitable endeavors, and in honor of his many years as an educator, Mr. Asche was selected as the honorary Grand Marshal of the Freeborn Area Sesquicentennial in 2007; he was featured as leader of the 92-unit Grand Parade.

As a direct result of the efforts of Lee Asche, dozens of FFA chapters, representing high schools throughout the state of Minnesota, continue to raise money through Corn Drives of their own, largely through donations of corn or cash from their own area farmers. Nearly 60 years after the initial Corn Drive by the Freeborn FFA, funds are still donated to the successor organization of the original Camp Courage, now known statewide as True Friends.
