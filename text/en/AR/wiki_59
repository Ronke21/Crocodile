<doc id="122913" wikidata="Q962980" url="?curid=122913" title="Olean, Missouri">
<text>Olean is a town in northern Miller County, Missouri, United States. The population was 114 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The community was laid in 1881-1882 by the Jefferson City, Lebanon and Southwestern Railway which became the Missouri Pacific Railroad. It was originally called &quot;Proctor&quot;, after James G. Proctor, who was an early settler. The name was rejected because there was another Procter in Missouri. It was then changed to &quot;Cove&quot; because of its semicircular shape. That name was also rejected because of another similar name in the state. &quot;Chester&quot; was suggested but again was rejected because there was another Chester on the rail line. Ultimately, the railroad company imposed the name &quot;Olean&quot;, after Olean, New York, apparently on a lark, as no documentation survives explaining any reasoning for choosing a city with no connections to the town in Missouri, which in turn had no connection to oil. Attribution to Dr. W.S. Allee appear not to be true, as Allee never lived in or visited New York State.

At the turn of the 20th century, Olean contained a gristmill and a canning factory.

The railroad left the community in 1962; its station is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Since 1993, the community has hosted an annual Testicle Festival featuring cooked testicles from various animals.
 The festival wasn&#x27;t held for several due to COVID-19 pandemic. 

The Olean Railroad Depot was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993.

==Geography==
Olean is in northern Miller County, north-northeast of Eldon and southwest of Jefferson City, the state capital. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Olean has an area of , all land. Blythe Creek passes through the southeast part of the town, flowing northeasterly toward South Moreau Creek, part of the Moreau watershed leading to the Missouri River.

<text>Charleston is a city in Mississippi County, Missouri, United States. The population was 5,056 at the 2020 census, a decrease from 5,947 in 2010. It is the county seat of Mississippi County and since 1968 has been home to the annual Dogwood-Azalea Festival which highlights the old homes and gardens throughout the town.

==History==
Charleston is the largest town on the Missouri side near the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. Its history has long been tied to river commerce and the development of the highly productive agricultural lands that surround the community.

Settlement initially occurred on the north side of town, in what in 1805 was called &quot;Matthews Prairie&quot;.

After purchasing for $337, Joseph Moore laid out Charleston in 1837. Some say the community derives its name from nearby Charles Prairie, while others believe the name is a transfer from Charleston, South Carolina. In 1845, it was selected as the county seat. A post office named Charleston has been in operation since 1847.

The Civil War Battle of Charleston was fought on August 19, 1861. Killed in the battle were one Union soldier and thirteen Missouri State Guard soldiers.

On September 1, 1861, Confederate General M. Jeff Thompson robbed the Union Bank of Charleston. Thompson, who handed the cashier a note, gave the cashier an hour to get approval from superiors to give him keys to the vault. After receiving the money, he left a receipt for $57,000 and discovered later that only $56,000 was in the bags.

The city was the epicenter of the October 31, 1895, 5.9 earthquake on the New Madrid Seismic Zone. The quake damaged virtually every building in Charleston, creating sand volcanoes and cracking a pier on the Cairo Rail Bridge. Chimneys toppled as far away as St. Louis, Missouri; Memphis, Tennessee; Gadsden, Alabama; and Evansville, Indiana. The fate of specific buildings may also be traced by Sanborn maps that were produced of the town during this period. This was the largest quake since the 1812 New Madrid earthquake, which measured at 8.3 and was the biggest recorded quake in the contiguous United States. One of the most visible signs of the quake is located south of Charleston at Henson Lake, which was greatly expanded by the quake.

In 1901, the county courthouse was built. It was designed by J.B. Legg, who designed numerous buildings throughout Missouri, including the Gasconade and St. Charles County courthouses. On February 10, 1997, the courthouse was damaged by fire and was subsequently torn down.

The Southeast Correctional Center, is a maximum security state prison for men that was opened in 2001. It is located on the southernmost edge of the city, less than one mile south of exit 10 off Interstate 57.

Just south of Charleston is Missouri&#x27;s largest American Flag mural. It was completed in 2024 by artist Ray Harvey of New Haven, Missouri. The mural is located on the property of Delta Growers Association and can be easily seen from Route 105. 

The Hearnes Site, Missouri Pacific Depot, Moore House, McCutchen Theatre, and Jacob Swank House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>California is a city in and the county seat of Moniteau County, Missouri, United States. As of the 2020 census the population was 4,498. It is the largest city in Moniteau County and the third largest city in the Jefferson City metropolitan area.

==History==
The City of California was established in 1834. The seat of justice of Moniteau County was originally known as Boonesborough. When Moniteau County was organized in 1845, it was decided that Boonsborough would become the county seat. Because the county court was unwilling to pay for land in Boonsborough, a site was selected one-mile (1.6 km) west which became the new county seat. In 1846, the Postal Service required a new name to be selected for Boonsborough since there was already a Boonsborough in Missouri. The city was renamed to California on January 25, 1847, for the territory on the West Coast that was just then drawing attention due to progress of the overland railroad. That same year, a courthouse was erected on the square.

California was incorporated in 1848 and elected its first city officials in 1858, 10 years later.

The &quot;Weekly California News&quot; printed its first edition on September 18, 1858, and is Moniteau County&#x27;s oldest established business still in operation. Today, it is known as the &quot;California Democrat&quot;.

By the end of the Civil War, California&#x27;s population was around 1,000. The city had ten dry goods stores, two drug stores, a tobacco factory, a large steam flouring mill and carding machine, a high school, a printing office, and a bank.

In 1867, money was appropriated for a new courthouse, which was completed in 1868 and is still in use today.

==Geography==
California is located in central Moniteau County. Missouri Route 87 passes through the center of the city as Oak Street, leading north to Jamestown and south to Eldon. U.S. Route 50 bypasses the city to the south, while its former route passes through the center of town as Buchanan Street. US 50 leads east to Jefferson City, the state capital, and west to Sedalia. 

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 0.36%, are water. The city sits atop a ridge which drains south to North Moreau Creek, a tributary of the Moreau River, which continues east to the Missouri River, and north to East Brush Creek, a tributary of Moniteau Creek, another tributary of the Missouri. The easternmost part of the city drains to Little Moniteau Creek.

The musical films &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; and &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;, both based on Mark Twain&#x27;s novels, were shot partially on location here. In 1976, the school of journalism at the University of Missouri published a book of photo essays on the history and the diminishing population of the city titled &quot;Lupus: portrait of a Missouri river town&quot;.

<doc id="122925" wikidata="Q960333" url="?curid=122925" title="Tipton, Missouri">
<text>Tipton is a city in Moniteau County, Missouri, United States. The population was 2,920 as of the 2020 census, down from 3,262 in 2010. It is part of the Jefferson City metropolitan area.

==History==
Tipton was a predominantly German-American community, in the region known as the Missouri Weinstrasse. Tipton was an eastern terminus of the Butterfield Overland Mail when it was launched in 1858. The route was connected to St. Louis by the Pacific Railroad. Tipton is named for William Tipton Seely, a businessman in nearby Round Hill. He received the land for his service in the War of 1812. From Tipton, a stage went to Fort Smith, Arkansas (where another branch from Memphis also entered). From there, it went on to Los Angeles and San Francisco via a route through southern Arizona and New Mexico. The first run went from Tipton to San Francisco from September 16 to October 10, 1858. The route antedated the Pony Express by two years. 
The route was designated a national historic trail in 2023.
The Maclay Mansion was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.


==Tipton 8 Ball Water Tower==
The city of Tipton has a water tower painted like an &quot;eight-ball&quot;. The tower originated in 1968, when Ewald Fischer (a native of Tipton) built his billiard table factory—Fischer Manufacturing Co., which claimed to be the largest builder of pool tables in the United States. The company was purchased by the Spalding Company, and the plant closed when Spalding sold it in 1976 to Ebonite Billiard, which was a subsidiary of Fuqua Companies. By then, the water tower was repainted. However, the residents of Tipton wanted to have the eight-ball back, so it was painted again. Today, the water tower is generally regarded as the world&#x27;s largest eight-ball.

==Geography==
Tipton is located in western Moniteau County at the intersection of U.S. Route 50 and Missouri Route 5. It is west of California, the Moniteau county seat, and east of Syracuse in adjacent Morgan County. Versailles is south on Route 5 in Morgan County.

The city is on high ground which drains north to Smiley Creek, which runs northeast to Moniteau Creek; and south towards Willow Fork, which runs east to North Moreau Creek and is part of the Moreau River watershed. Moniteau Creek and the Moreau River each run east to the Missouri River.

<text>Florida is a village in Monroe County, Missouri, United States. It is located at the intersection of Missouri Route 107 and State Route U on the shores of Mark Twain Lake. In 1910 the population was 200, per the census data in the 1911 Cram&#x27;s World Atlas. As of the 2020 census, however, the reported population was five. The Mark Twain Birthplace State Historic Site is located in Florida, with Mark Twain State Park nearby.

== History ==

Mark Twain was born in Florida in 1835. He said his birthplace was &quot;a nearly invisible village&quot;, and &quot;The village contained a hundred people and I increased the population by 1 per cent. It is more than many of the best men in history could have done for a town.&quot;

The village was laid out in the winter of 1831. The community took its name from the state of Florida. The founders were Robert Donaldson, Joseph Grigsby, Hugh A. Hickman, a Doctor Keenan, John Witt, and Major W.N. Penn. Hickman owned and operated a mill approximately one half-mile (800 m) south of Florida, while Penn had a dry goods store near there as well. Penn soon moved his store into Florida proper, becoming the town&#x27;s first business.

In the early years there was some hope of the town becoming a regional point of commerce and shipping. Florida is located at the confluence of the North, South, and Middle forks of the Salt River, upstream from its mouth emptying into the Mississippi River at Louisiana, Missouri. The location was thought to be strategic because it was felt to be a potential &quot;growth center&quot; in the settlement of northeast Missouri. For example, John Clemens, father of Mark Twain, along with other investors, had formed the Salt River Navigation Company in 1836 in hopes of developing this water commerce. Several boatloads of flour were shipped from Hickman&#x27;s mill to the Mississippi and returned with sugar, coffee, and manufactured goods. However, fickle river levels on the Salt made consistent shipping via barge or riverboat impractical. Having no railroad and with river shipping no longer an option, Florida was destined to remain a small village attending to the commerce needs of area farmers.

The Clemens family, seeking better opportunities, left Florida for Hannibal, Missouri, when young Samuel was around five years old. He would continue to visit Florida for extended summer vacations at his uncle John Quarles&#x27; farm. Such summer memories and social interactions with Quarles house servants formed many of the sketches and perspectives that Clemens placed in his novels. The Quarles farmhouse remains as an active archeological project available to the public near Florida.

=== Civil War ===
As part of the area known as Little Dixie, Monroe County&#x27;s residents largely sided with the Confederacy during the Civil War. The area around Florida was the scene of two small battles during the conflict. The first happened in July 1861. Brigadier General Thomas A. Harris of the pro-Confederate Missouri State Guard had established his headquarters at Florida in June, and by early July he had nearly 500 troops in the immediate vicinity under his command. When informed of this growing threat by Union sympathizers and Federal spies, Union commander Nathaniel Lyon in St. Louis ordered action be taken. On July 8, 1861, Federal forces consisting of six companies of regular infantry plus a company of Hannibal Home Guards — around six hundred men total — and a cannon with crew, set out from Palmyra, Missouri, toward Florida.

Learning of their approach, General Harris sent a unit of approximately 50 men to reconnoiter and harass the Federals. The opposing forces clashed at a place called Hagar&#x27;s Hill, north of Florida. Hidden by thick timber and brush, the State Guardsmen ambushed the Federals, opening fire at very close range. The Federal troops quickly regrouped and returned heavy fire with their superior numbers, causing the State Guard force to flee. Casualties were surprisingly light, with one State Guardsman killed and a few others slightly wounded. The Federals had none killed but three seriously wounded. Meanwhile, the bulk of State Guard and various Confederate bushwhackers had outflanked the Federals and attacked Monroe City, Missouri, and its vital railroad line. This forced the Federals to turn back from the march on Florida.

The second Civil War action to happen near Florida occurred about one year later. On July 22, 1862, a Confederate force (numbers vary between 300 and 400 men) under Colonel Joseph C. Porter were traveling south through Monroe County after a raid on Memphis, Missouri, and the Battle of Vassar Hill in Scotland County. At Florida, they were surprised by a detachment of Federal cavalry, approximately fifty men, under Major Henry Clay Caldwell. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the Federals engaged Porter&#x27;s force, and a battle ensued for approximately an hour. After suffering six killed, twenty-two wounded, and two captured, Caldwell and his cavalry retreated to Paris, Missouri. Porter, having only one killed and three wounded, also left the area, continuing on toward Callaway County, clashing with Federal forces again on July 24, near Santa Fe, and at the Battle of Moore&#x27;s Mill on July 28.

=== Postbellum ===

Florida continued a pattern of slow growth after the Civil War, reaching its peak population of 280 residents in 1880. The 20th century was not nearly so kind to the community, however, especially after World War II, as businesses closed and families moved away to find better opportunities in cities. The construction of Mark Twain Lake in the mid-1960s permanently flooded some of the valuable farmland around Florida, although it opened more opportunities for recreation and tourism. In 1960, the state of Missouri created the Mark Twain Birthplace State Historic Site. Twain&#x27;s birthplace was moved into a climate-controlled museum setting, which also contains exhibits and displays such as rare first edition books, a hand-written manuscript of &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot;, and furnishings from his home. A red granite monument elsewhere in Florida marks the original site of Twain&#x27;s birth home.

In addition to the Mark Twain Birthplace State Historic Site, the Crigler Mound Group Archeological Site and Merritt Violette House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Florida is located in eastern Monroe County, overlooking Mark Twain Lake, a reservoir on the Salt River. The North and Middle forks of the Salt River join within the lake, just east of the bluff on which Florida stands. The Mark Twain Birthplace State Historic Site lies along what is now the eastern edge of the village, while Mark Twain State Park, a public recreation area associated with Mark Twain Lake, borders the village to the south and west. Missouri Route 107 runs along the western boundary of the village, leading north to U.S. Route 24 and south less than to Missouri Route 154. Paris, the Monroe county seat, is to the west via State Highway U and US 24.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 9 people, 4 households, and 2 families residing in the village. The population density was . There were 21 housing units at an average density of . All residents were White.

<text>New Madrid ( ; ) is a city in New Madrid County, Missouri, United States. The population was 2,787 at the 2020 census. New Madrid is the county seat of New Madrid County. The city is located 42 miles (68 km) southwest of Cairo, Illinois, and north of an exclave of Fulton County, Kentucky, across the Mississippi River.
The town is on the north side of the Kentucky Bend in the Mississippi River, which is also known as &quot;New Madrid Bend&quot; or &quot;Madrid Bend.&quot; The river curves in an oxbow around an exclave of Fulton County, Kentucky. Scientists expect the river eventually to cut across the neck of the peninsula and make a more direct channel, leaving the Kentucky territory as an island.

New Madrid was the epicenter of the very powerful 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes.

==History==
The first more or less permanent settlement at present-day New Madrid was established by bands of Shawnee, Delaware, Creek, and Cherokee who were turned into refugees due to the U.S. War for Independence. These refugee Native American bands accepted Spanish offers to settle on the west bank of the Mississippi River in the early 1780s. These mixed Native American groups established a settlement and informal trading post where a northward, horseshoe bend of the Mississippi met the Chepusa creek, which provided an easy place for landing boats. Native American hunters and European-American merchants made the settlement a location for processing the bounty of hunts, including the valuable but messy fat of bears and buffalo, which was used in preparing skins and furs. The settlement quickly acquired the name L’Anse a la Graise — “Cove of Grease” or “Greasy Cove.”

European Americans renamed the settlement New Madrid around 1780 under the auspices of Spanish Governor Bernardo de Gálvez, who was appointed to rule Spanish Louisiana (the land west of the Mississippi River), and Manuel Pérez, Lieutenant Governor of Upper Louisiana in Saint Louis. They welcomed settlers from the United States, but required them to become subjects of (i.e. swear allegiance to) the Spanish crown. In addition, they had to agree to live under the guidance of his appointed empresario, Colonel George Morgan, an American Revolutionary War veteran from New Jersey. Morgan recruited a number of American families to settle at New Madrid, attracting a few hundred people to the region. Settlement in the 1790s and early 1800s remained relatively low due to the physical geography of New Madrid and its hinterlands. The Mississippi frequently washed away the town&#x27;s river banks, and a Spanish fort was washed away. Surrounded by low, swampy land, New Madrid developed a well-earned reputation for diseases, especially in the summer and fall. Spanish census data from the late 1790s show around 800 residents at the village of New Madrid. New Madrid continued to operate as a site of exchange between Native Americans in the St. Francis River Valley and European American traders operating out of New Madrid.

In 1800, Spain traded the territory back to France in the Third Treaty of San Ildefonso. After trying to regain control of Saint-Domingue (the present Haiti), where a slave rebellion was underway, Napoleon gave up on his North American colonies, agreeing to sell this territory to the United States in 1803 as part of the Louisiana Purchase.

The area is noted as the site of a series of nearly 2,000 earthquakes in 1811 and 1812, ranging up to approximately magnitude 8, the most powerful non-subduction zone earthquake ever recorded in the United States. New Madrid lies far from any plate boundaries, but it is on the New Madrid Seismic Zone. The major earthquake was felt as far away as the East Coast.

Starting in 1838, New Madrid was on the Trail of Tears that saw thousands of Indians forcefully removed from Eastern lands and moving to Oklahoma.

During the Civil War, the Battle of Island Number Ten took place on the Mississippi River near New Madrid.

In the antebellum period, this fertile floodplain area was developed for cotton plantations, based on the labor of enslaved African Americans. They were emancipated after the Civil War and worked to make new lives. As whites struggled to re-establish dominance after the Reconstruction era, they intimidated and attacked blacks under the guise of Jim Crow laws, working to suppress voting and control their activities.

Three African-American men are documented as being lynched by whites in New Madrid, the county seat, near the turn of the century: Unknown Negro, on November 29, 1898; Louis Wright, a musician in a minstrel show accused of altercations with whites, hanged on February 17, 1902; and unknown Negro, May 30, 1910.

By the turn of the 20th century, some industry was being developed in New Madrid, which contained two lumber mills, a grist mill, a stave and heading factory, and a cotton gin. It was considered a rough town. There were four Protestant churches, two with independent African-American congregations, and one Catholic church.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Climate===
New Madrid has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) with hot, humid summers and chilly, though not severe winters.

The hottest has been record on August 4, 1964, whilst an average of 2.9 days exceed .

Rainfall is fairly heavy throughout the year due to moist air from the Gulf being advected on the western side of the Bermuda High, plus occasional remnant depressions from hurricanes passing up the Mississippi Valley.

It became a fourth class city in 1905.

On April 14, 2015, Tyus Byrd was sworn in as the first African-American woman mayor of Parma. Byrd succeeded Randall Ramsey, who had been mayor of Parma for a total of 37 years. Shortly before Byrd was to be sworn in, four of the city&#x27;s six police officers resigned, along with the city&#x27;s clerk and the supervisor of water treatment. 

In January 2019 the Missouri State Auditor opened an investigation into the city&#x27;s finances based on a whistle-blower tip. Her initial report indicated serious mismanagement and loss of funds. Her final report showed that official records had been falsified and more than $115,000 had been misappropriated.

In April 2019, Byrd lost her reelection campaign to Rufus Lee Williamson Jr. Within hours of Williamson&#x27;s swearing in, the city was shocked by arsons burning down Tyus Bird&#x27;s house and setting fire to the records and other departments at city hall. The city&#x27;s main computer and numerous financial documents were destroyed.

On November 23, 2020, Tyus Byrd was arrested in Jonesboro, Arkansas on charges of stealing $25,000 or more and forgery, and subsequently charged with two counts of forgery and two counts of receiving stolen property. Two other former employees of the city had also been arrested the former city clerk, Helen Jean Frye, and former city water supervisor David L. Thatch. Helen Frye received a sentence of seven years, 120 days of incarceration and then probation. while Tyus Byrd received a ten-year suspended sentence. David L. Thatch was to stand trial in 2024.

===Public schools===
Currently, Parma has no local school system. Students attend New Madrid County Central R-I School District in New Madrid.

===History===
After the founding of the community of Parma, rapid growth led to the formation of a school system. From the late 1890s to 1910, various one room structures in the Parma area were utilized for education. The first structure for strictly school purposes was erected in 1910. By 1935, an increasing student population demanded the need for a larger high school building. With 9.9 square feet per pupil, Amendment No. 3 or The School Bond was placed on the ballot. After a summer of strong campaigning from the school district and other community leaders, Amendment No. 3 passed by a vote of 284-29 on October 19, 1935. Construction commenced in the fall of 1936 and the first classes began in the fall of 1937. The original 1933 gymnasium burned in 1944. Once again, the citizens of Parma banded together to fund construction of a new gymnasium which was completed by fall of 1944. The athletic teams, known as the Parma Pirates, were the pride of the school and surrounding community. In 1980, the Parma Consolidated School District No. 5 was consolidated into the New Madrid County Central R-I School District. Over the next several decades, the school complex fell into a state of disrepair. A major fire in the fall of 2010 brought the entire high school complex to the ground.

===2017 Memorial===

In the summer of 2016, several PHS alumni and former community leaders formed the Parma School Memorial Committee. They were successful in their efforts to raise funds to construct a large monument on the grounds of the old high school building. The memorial was dedicated on July 1, 2017.

===Public library===
Parma has a lending library, a branch of the New Madrid County Library.

<doc id="122964" wikidata="Q1000065" url="?curid=122964" title="Neosho, Missouri">
<text>Neosho (; originally or ) is the most populous city in Newton County, Missouri, United States, which it serves as the county seat. With a population of 12,590 as of the 2020 census, the city is a part of the Joplin, Missouri Metropolitan Statistical Area, a region with an estimated 176,849 (2011) residents. Neosho lies on the western edge of the Ozarks, in the far southwest of the state.

The name &quot;Neosho&quot; is of Osage derivation from &quot;Ne-u-zhu&quot;, meaning &quot;clear, cold water&quot;, &quot;many waters&quot;, or &quot;the meeting of waters&quot;, which refers to local freshwater springs. The springs attracted varying cultures of Native American inhabitants for thousands of years. The Osage Nation had long occupied the territory at the time of European contact.

Like the Osage, European-American settlers were also attracted to the springs, and founded the community of Neosho in 1833. It was incorporated as a municipal government in 1878. Nicknamed &quot;City of Springs&quot;, Neosho has long served as an agricultural center. Since 1888, it has been the site of the Neosho National Fish Hatchery, the oldest in the National Fish Hatchery System.

It is known locally as the &quot;Gateway to the Ozarks&quot;. Since 1957, it has also been identified as &quot;the Flower Box City&quot;.

==History==

===Settlement: 1829−1845===
Starting in the late 1820s, European-American settlers of English, Scottish, German, Welsh, and Scots-Irish ancestry began moving into the area. The first of these settlers was Lunsford Oliver, who migrated from Tennessee in 1829 and located near Shoal Creek. He was the namesake for Oliver&#x27;s Prairie. His nearest neighbors were in Springfield, sixty miles to the east. In 1831 he was joined by Nathaniel Turner, John Smith, Joseph Ross, Campbell Pure, Blake Wilson, Levi Lee, Carmac Ratcliffe, and George McInturf. McInturf built a corn mill, the first mill of any kind in the region. Soon afterward came Mathew H. Ritchie, who founded the town of Newtonia near Oliver&#x27;s Prairie, and John W. McCord, who settled near Walbridge Spring with Levie Lee and founded the town Neosho to the west. In these years, the region was called &quot;Six Bulls&quot;, a colloquial reference to &quot;six boils&quot;, referring to the large streams that flowed through the area – Shoal Creek, Center Creek, Indian Creek, Spring River, and North Fork.

By 1835, at least three schools had been established along Shoal Creek, and a teacher named Billingsley taught near Neosho. The earliest known religious effort dates to 1836, when Methodist Circuit riders visited the area and held meetings in settlers&#x27; log cabins.

In 1843, Rev. Anthony Bewley was appointed to the Neosho and Granby circuit, establishing the first permanent churches in Six Bulls. Rev. John W. McCord was involved in organizing Neosho Presbytery, a Cumberland Presbyterian congregation at New Salem Campground, on May 15, 1837. These early settlers were sometimes visited by Native Americans from the Southeast United States, who had been relocated from Georgia to the Indian Territory a few miles west of later Kansas under the Indian Removal Act. They periodically came into the area on hunting expeditions.

Newton County was originally contained in Crawford County and afterward in Barry County. As the population increased, it was separated from Barry County on December 31, 1838, and established as a county under its present name. It was named in honor of American Revolutionary War veteran Sergeant John Newton. He was a comrade of Sergeant William Jasper, who is memorialized at Fort Moultrie. Later the counties of Jasper, McDonald, and Barton, were successively created from some of Newton&#x27;s territory.

The first county court session was held at Reed&#x27;s residence on April 13, 1839, Judge Foster P. Wright presiding. John Reed, Hugh Shannon, and Jacob Testerman sat as judges under appointment by Lilburn Boggs, Governor of Missouri. John Reed was made presiding judge, Thomas Mosely Jr., appointed as clerk; John Haskins, as assessor; and Isaac Gibson as sheriff. Townships were established and roads laid out by this body.

On November 12, the commissioners reported Neosho as the permanent seat of justice, and James Wilson was appointed a special commissioner to lay out the town. The first elected county judges were Edward V. Warren, Larkin Newton, Samuel V. Warren, and Samuel M. Cooley, with Milton Sexton as clerk in 1840. That same year, Milton Sexton, as superintendent, built the first courthouse, a log structure that was occupied in March 1841. In 1841, Charles S. Yancey became circuit judge of the Thirteenth Judicial District, to which Newton County was attached. The first state representative was John Wilson.

In 1840, Lemuel B. Hearrell conducted a school at Hickory Creek, which at times numbered forty pupils. In 1842, Wilson opened the first school in Neosho. He taught classical Latin and higher mathematics. The Methodist Church was active in the area from 1845.

During the 1840s, lead was discovered and entrepreneurs developed mining here. Neosho&#x27;s early commercial development was dominated by lead and zinc mining. Newton County established one of Missouri&#x27;s earliest commercial operations. Lead was transported by wagon from Neosho to Indian Territory, then shipped down the Arkansas River and Mississippi River to New Orleans. French colonists had conducted lead mining further east in Missouri before the United States acquired the territory in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803.

===Realignment: 1846−1861===

In 1846, a strip wide was detached from northern Newton and attached to southern Jasper County. A survey of the community was undertaken in 1846 by F. M. Duncan, who laid out the courthouse square and surrounding blocks. According to the survey, the town covered an area of about and was laid off beginning at the &quot;west edge of the large spring and ... northeast of a large white oak&quot;, which included land originally belonging to John McCord.

Part of McCord&#x27;s relinquished land was returned to him. He subdivided it to take advantage of development related to nearby Neosho. This subdivision, later incorporated into the city limits, is still called &quot;McCord&#x27;s Addition to Neosho&quot;. On August 20, 1847, Neosho was legally incorporated with William C. Jones, Jackson C. McKay, Samuel Rice, William B. Holmes, and William B. Mooney as trustees.

The first Baptist congregation was organized at Neosho in 1847, with the Rev. W.H. Farmer as pastor. He served until 1859.

In 1849, McDonald County was created by an act of the state legislature from the southern portion of Newton County, reducing it to its present dimensions. The same act named John Williams of Taney County, James Williams of Barry County, and Chesley Cannifex of Greene County as commissioners to locate the seat of justice within of the new geographical center of the county. They designated the temporary seat at the home of John Reed, one and one-half miles east of the present site of downtown Neosho. Later the same year, a log jail was built.

The design of the courthouse square followed that of the Shelbyville Square Plan, which has lots arranged to face a central courthouse block. A brick courthouse built in 1850 at a cost of $3,000 replaced the earlier log structure. During the next decade, numerous residential and commercial buildings were constructed in and around the courthouse square. The first newspaper printed in the county was the &quot;Neosho Chief&quot;, founded in 1854 by J. Webb Graves. It was renamed as the &quot;Neosho Herald&quot; and was removed in 1861 to Arkansas after the outbreak of the American Civil War. Its records were captured by the Union Army.

By special act passed on August 3, 1854, Congress laid out a monthly Pony Express mail route from Neosho to Albuquerque, New Mexico, authorizing an annual budget of $17,000. After the Mexican–American War and the acquisition by the US of the southwest territory, this region became of great commercial and military importance. But the Pony Express route was not a commercial success. In March of the following year, the route was changed to run from Independence to Stockton, California, via Albuquerque.

===Civil War: 1861−1865===

During the Civil War, the county was occupied alternately by the opposing forces. Several engagements were fought in and around Neosho, Newtonia, and Granby, at some places more than once. In addition, frequent skirmishes took place between small units and raids by area bandits. The schools were closed during the war, and most of the schoolhouses destroyed. The new courthouse was occupied by troops of both armies during the war and finally destroyed . After the war, the county records were found intact in a cell in the jail. R.W. Ellis, the county clerk, had concealed them there before he left to join the Confederate Army in 1861.

On July 3, 1861 the Union force of Col. Franz Sigel moved from Neosho to find and trap Gov Jackson&#x27;s Missouri State Guard force, reported to be somewhere near Lamar, Missouri. Sigel believed that another Union force should be chasing them from their Union victory at Boonville on June 17. Col. Sigel knew that Sterling Price and another Confederate Army were south of his position, so he garrisoned Neosho. Captain Conrad and his Rifle Company B of the 3rd Missouri Infantry, numbering about 80 men, were selected.

When Brigadier General Benjamin McCulloch agreed to General Price&#x27;s request for assistance with the Missouri State Guard, he moved north. Hearing of the Union force at Neosho, they sent four companies of the 1st Arkansas Mounted Rifles and Cpt. Carroll&#x27;s Company of Arkansas State troops to capture them. On July 5, the garrison sent forces north to Carthage to ascertain the situation, as the Battle of Carthage was ongoing. Col. McIntosh ordered a two-pronged advance to Neosho, but the western force found its route longer than expected. McIntosh ordered the surrender of the company of Union troops as his Mounted Infantry companies came within two hundred yards of the court house, where the Union force was stationed. With no pickets to the south and a force to the west of town, the Confederates accepted unconditional surrender just as the second force arrived on scene. Captain Conrad&#x27;s men were paroled on July 8 and were escorted the first four miles to protect them from numerous threats against their lives made by Neosho locals. The Union troops marched unarmed to Springfield, making 85 miles in 50 hours.

On October 21, Missouri Governor Claiborne Jackson and the pro-Southern members of the Missouri General Assembly, who had been forced to flee from Jefferson City when the Union Army approached, held their next to last legislative session at Neosho. On October 28, 1861, they established a provisional capital in Neosho.

Governor Jackson and the Missouri General Assembly met in the Masonic Hall, numbering thirty-nine members of the House and ten of the Senate. They passed an ordinance of secession and the event was celebrated with cannon firing by General Sterling Price&#x27;s State Guardsmen who were camped in the adjacent hills. The Confederate States government accepted the results of the vote, and Missouri was admitted as the 12th state of the Confederacy. However, the pro-Union members of the General Assembly had already convened, and supported by the occupying Union troops, had declared Jackson removed from office, as well as all who favored the South. The pro-Union members then set up a their own provisional government and appointed Hamilton R. Gamble to be governor. Missouri would have three governors during the course of the Civil War, one elected by the people (Jackson) and two appointed by the pro-Union government (Gamble and William Preble Hall).

General Price made an effort to organize a Confederate defense of Missouri and initially succeeded, but any chance for concerted pro-Southern action ended when he was defeated in March 1862 at Pea Ridge.

During 1862, various engagements between the hostile forces occurred in the vicinity of Neosho. In 1863, Neosho was garrisoned by Union troops, part of the time with American Indian soldiers occupying the courthouse. On October 4, 1863, a portion of the town was burned by Confederate General Joseph Shelby, who appeared with 1,100 men and, after shelling the courthouse, received the surrender of Union Captain McAfee and his 200 men. Confederate casualties in the fight were seven dead and 22 wounded.

No court was held from May 22, 1861 until after the war, when on June 19, 1865, when Tipton O. Wood, Frederick Gallimore, and James R. Pearson sat as a county court with W.I.I. Morrow as clerk and Harvey Conly as sheriff; all were temporarily commissioned by the Governor. In 1866, elections were finally held and order was established. In 1866 a board of education was organized, consisting of Lyman Beebe, J.H. Price Sr., R.V. Keller, E.H. Benham, Hubbard F. Jones and Edwin Ebert. A school site was purchased and the existing building repaired. In 1867, a small two-story building was erected for courthouse purposes and the county officers were provided for there and in private buildings until 1878, when a substantial stone and brick building was completed at a cost of $16,250. In 1887, a jail was built. The first circuit court session was held at the house of Judge John Reed on July 22, 1839, Judge Foster P. Wright presiding.

Debate flourishes to this day regarding the legitimacy of these actions, or for that matter those of the Union men who deposed him from office. Claiborne Jackson continued to serve as governor in the Confederate-held portions of the state. But by the end of 1861, Union forces would occupy almost all of Missouri. Jackson took refuge in Arkansas, dying in Little Rock the following year of cancer. A Union victory at the Battle of Pea Ridge in northwest Arkansas in early 1862 sealed Missouri&#x27;s fate as a Union border state.

===Reconstruction: 1866−1899===
Following the Civil War, Neosho became a prominent commercial center of southwest Missouri during the late 19th century. The population of the small community grew in size from approximately 500 to 2,725 between 1870 and 1900. During these decades dozens of brick commercial buildings were built around the central courthouse square containing a wide variety of private businesses including lumber yards, livery stables, general stores, and hotels. In addition to retail shops and stores the city also boasted numerous manufacturing companies such as wagon factories, mills, and even a cigar factory. A new brick courthouse was constructed in 1878 followed by a county jail in 1888.

The Atlantic and Pacific Railroad reached Neosho in 1870. The A&amp; P eventually became the San Francisco and St Louis railroad. In 1878, Neosho was incorporated and the first permanent courthouse was constructed in the center of the town square. In 1887 the Kansas City-Fort Smith and Southern Railroad entered Neosho. The KCFS&amp; S served the Neosho National Fish Hatchery, the oldest Federal Fish Hatchery still operating today, which was built the following year. This railroad was eventually sold to the Kansas City Southern Railroad which still operates and runs through Neosho today.

In the 1882, after the vineyards of France, Spain, and Portugal were struck by the deadly phylloxera louse, it was determined that grapes bred by Neosho winemaker Hermann Jaeger were resistant to the louse. His work proved to be a savior for the great vineyards of Europe. Working with other scholars and grape growers, Jaeger supplied cuttings from his Monark Springs vineyards to help replant those lost in Europe. For his contribution to the grape and wine industries of France, Jaeger was awarded the coveted French Legion of Honour, the highest award that that nation can bestow on a civilian.

By 1898, there were 101 schools in Newton County with 139 teachers and 7,618 pupils. The permanent school fund was $23,260.28. The population of the county in 1900 was 28,001. By the start of the 20th century the city Neosho was a thriving community connected by three rail lines and exporting a variety of products and agricultural produce. The courthouse square continued as Neosho&#x27;s commercial and governmental center well into the 20th century. Numerous commercial buildings were constructed from 1900 to 1930 including the four-story Haas Building on the north side of the square. The Missouri and North Arkansas Railroad ran from the Arkansas resort town of Eureka Springs to Neosho where it connected with the Frisco and Kansas City Southern tracks in 1908.

===20th century===
On August 5, 1914 there was a head-on collision between motorcar No. 103 of passenger train of the Missouri &amp; North Arkansas Railroad Company and locomotive No. 805, of a regular passenger train of the Kansas City Southern Railway Company, near Tipton Ford, a few miles north of Neosho. Because Motorcar No. 103 was carrying about 105 gallons of gasoline at the time, 43 passengers died, many burned beyond recognition, several others were injured, and the motorcar was entirely demolished. Two days later the city held a funeral on the Newton County courthouse lawn for more than 30 unidentified individuals, who were buried in a mass grave in the Neosho I.O.O.F. cemetery.
During the Great Depression, the federal government assisted financially in the construction of the Neosho City Hall and Municipal Auditorium, as well as the current Newton County Courthouse. Funded by the Works Progress Administration, the original courthouse was razed in December 1935 to make way for the current Carthage stone, Art Deco-style courthouse, which was designed by architect Neal C. Davis, a Newton County native. Construction of the new courthouse began in April 1936. In 1938, another Davis-designed, WPA-funded project, the Auditorium and City Hall, was completed. This building was extensively restored and modernized in a multi-million project completed in September 2008.

Neosho is the home of Fort Crowder. Originally established as Camp Crowder south of town in 1941 at the height of World War II, the post was to serve as an armored training center. By 1943 the army had acquired in Newton and McDonald counties. As the facility was constructed, it was re-designated as a U.S. Army Signal Corps training center. It was named for Enoch Crowder, a Missouri general who was instrumental in developing the draft for World War I and the Selective Service. The post also served as an infantry replacement center; later in the war, it had a small German prisoner-of-war detention facility.
Some of the soldiers stationed at Camp Crowder included Carl Reiner, Dick Van Dyke, Mort Walker, Tillman Franks, and Jean Shepherd. Writers for the 1960s-era &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, made the post the setting where Rob and Laura Petrie, portrayed by actors Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore, met; Rob was a sergeant in Special Services and Laura was a USO dancer. The camp was well known to its residents for being muddy and swampy during the rainy season. The cartoonist Mort Walker, who was stationed there, later used it for his fictional &quot;Camp Swampy&quot; in his long-running newspaper comic strip, &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot;.

Camp Crowder was deactivated in 1951. While the core of the post was retained, many of the temporary barracks were declared surplus and sold. The base&#x27;s movie theatre was disassembled and reassembled on the campus of what is today the University of Missouri – Kansas City. It served as the Kansas City Playhouse until being torn down for a new theatre. A portion of its wall, which contains statues of Comedy and Tragedy, are landmarks on the university campus. Neosho obtained the permanent barracks as surplus and adapted them as the core of the community college campus for Crowder College.

====The Flower Box City====
Since 1957, Neosho has been locally well known as &quot;The Flower Box City&quot;; that year it earned the All-America City Award for its beautification efforts. In 1955 the town had received a $5,000 grant from The New York Community Trust for that purpose. Local companies provided lumber at cost, and the Jaycees formed an assembly line to build more than 200 wooden flower boxes. Pet Milk Company donated 400 used wooden barrels for container gardens, and town nurseries supplied plants at reduced rates. The city dressed up trash cans and parking meters around the courthouse square with flower baskets. In 1957 Neosho earned a coveted All-America City Award from &quot;Look&quot; magazine and the National Municipal League. (The &quot;Life&quot; magazine photojournalist Wallace Kirkland covered the 1957 city for the magazine. A life collection of his photographs from this assignment, many previously unpublished, can be found in the Life photo archive, hosted by Google). Since then, the Flower Box Promotion Committee has supported beautification and awarded &#x27;Beauty Spot&#x27; prizes each spring and summer to homes and businesses with outstanding yards, flower gardens, and flower boxes.

====Fort Crowder====
In the early 1950s, local congressman Dewey Jackson Short, senior member of the House Armed Services Committee, secured authorization and some funding to build two permanent barracks and a disciplinary barracks to reactivate the former Camp Crowder as a permanent installation, Fort Crowder. Its mission was to be the Army&#x27;s military police training school. After Short&#x27;s defeat in the 1956 election, the fort was deactivated.

About of the post was turned over to the U. S. Air Force, which constructed Plant 65. The rocket engine manufacturing facility was operated by contract to North American Aviation, later known as Rocketdyne. This facility became Rocketdyne&#x27;s primary manufacturing and testing complex for the H-1 rocket engine, used by the Saturn I and Saturn IB rockets. These rockets were used in NASA&#x27;s Apollo, Skylab, and Apollo-Soyuz Test Project programs until its contract ended in 1968.

On April 24, 1975, a major tornado caused massive destruction and killed three persons. It destroyed a motel, apartment complex and mobile home park, along with dozens of homes and businesses.

===21st century===
Today, Neosho is enjoying a renaissance, particularly in the historic downtown area.

==Geography and climate==

===Geography===
Neosho is in south central Newton County approximately 15 miles south-southeast of Joplin. It is at the intersection of US routes 60 and 71.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Neosho is noted for numerous springs including:

====Big Spring====
Also known historically as Clark Spring, Big Spring is Neosho&#x27;s largest spring and is located near the historic downtown in the city&#x27;s main park, Big Spring Park. This spring issues at the base of a high bluff of Mississippian limestone from a series of cavernous openings developed along a bedding plane, and flows through the city park.

====Bell&#x27;s Iron Spring====

Also known as historically as Walbridge Spring, located east of the Big Spring and a block east of the courthouse square, Bell&#x27;s Iron Spring played an important role in Neosho&#x27;s development. Originally rising in the valley and capable of supplying a city of 50,000 people, though hidden from view for many years, this spring is currently the focus of an ongoing restoration project, which includes plans to re-expose the spring and redevelop the surrounding property as a public historic park. Due to the recent discovery of the presence of endangered Ozark cave fish in the spring, the city is working closely with Missouri Department of Conservation and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

====Hatchery springs====

Hearrell, McMahon, Bartholic, and Elm Springs supply water to the Neosho National Fish Hatchery. In 1888, Hearrell Spring, named after Lemuel B Hearrell, began supplying water to the newly built hatchery. In 1908, McMahon Spring was added to supply the hatchery&#x27;s fish rearing ponds, after its condemnation under the governmental power of eminent domain. In 1964, after the closing of nearby Fort Crowder, additional water was supplied by Elm Spring and Bartholic Spring. With Hearrell Spring producing nearly the same volume of water as Big Spring, the combined flow of these four springs is about 2,000,000 gallons per day as it arrives at the hatchery. While Hearrell Spring arises at the hatchery, water from the other springs is piped several miles by pipeline from their origins to the hatchery.

====Other springs====
* Bethesda Spring – in the northeast section. Historically notable for its purported healing properties.
* Birch Spring – a strong spring just south of the Bethesda Spring.
* Brock&#x27;s Spring – on the eastern line of Neosho.
* Carter &amp; Clark Springs – in the northern part of town. Considered by early residents to have medicinal qualities.
* Hobo Spring – also known as Williams Spring, west of downtown.
* McElhany Springs – forming a bold stream of freestone water in the western part of the town.
* Mertin Springs – three springs north of the Bethesda spring which rush from beneath a cliff.
* Morse Spring
* Sevier&#x27;s Springs – two soft water springs just south of Brock&#x27;s Spring.

===Climate===
Neosho lies near the geographic center of the contiguous United States, in an area with a high concentration of freshwater streams and lakes. This makes for a humid subtropical (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfa&quot;) with moderate precipitation and extremes of hot and cold. Summers can be very humid, with moist air riding up from the Gulf of Mexico, and during July and August daytime highs can reach into the triple digits. Winters vary from mild days to bitterly cold, with lows reaching into the teens below zero a few times a year.

Neosho is situated in &quot;Tornado Alley&quot;, a broad region where cold air from the Rocky Mountains and Canada collides with warm air from the Gulf of Mexico, leading to the formation of powerful storms. Neosho has had many severe outbreaks of tornadoes, including an EF4 tornado hit the Neosho area on May 10, 2008, and traveled about in two states, as well as a major tornado that caused massive destruction on April 24, 1975, which resulted in three killed and many injured. The region is also prone to ice storms, such as the 2007 ice storm during which hundreds of thousands lost power for days and (in some cases) weeks. The White House declared 34 counties in Missouri disaster areas. Damage in Missouri totaled $352.9 million (2007 USD).

<text>Seneca is a city in western Newton County, Missouri, United States. The population was 2,336 at the 2010 census. Located on the southwestern border of the state, the city is part of the Joplin, Missouri Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Seneca was platted by European Americans in 1869, following the Civil War.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eaton, David Wolfe 1917 https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_RfAuAAAAYAAJ/page/n106 335&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The city was named for the Seneca Nation, one of the Six Nations of the Iroquois League, or &quot;Haudenosaunee&quot;, who had been historically based in New York and south of the Great Lakes. 

In the 1830s, many of the Seneca people still in the East had been pushed west of the Mississippi River into Indian Territory, which included parts of present-day Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma. &quot;This tribe was moved to the Indian Territory not many miles west of town. The word is a corruption of the Dutch word &quot;Sinnekaas,&quot; a term applied to them.&quot; 

A post office called Seneca has been in operation since 1869.

Several houses in the rural northern Seneca area were destroyed by a tornado on May 10, 2008 in the Mid-May 2008 tornado outbreak sequence. An EF4 tornado hit the county, killing 13 people. &quot;The Early Show&quot; broadcast their national weather report from the city on the following Monday morning. 

On the one- year anniversary of the tornado, Bill Lant, owner of Lant&#x27;s Feed and Country Store, unveiled a memorial for the people who had died in the disaster. He had donated the plot of land and memorial, and had the memorial built next to his store.

==Geography==
Seneca is located on Lost Creek, approximately one-quarter mile from the Missouri-Oklahoma state line. Missouri Route 43 passes through the town and U.S. Route 60 passes just south of the location. Neosho is about ten miles east, along Route 60.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Seneca is located in Lost Creek Valley, five miles upstream from the Grand Lake of the Cherokees and five miles downstream from the quaint Old Settlers town of Racine. The Frisco Railroad (now Burlington-Northern) runs through this valley.

Prior to 1959, highway traffic to and from Oklahoma largely followed US 60 through Seneca. US 60 joins the more famous U.S. Route 66, approximately 15 miles west of Seneca.

<text>Stella is a village in southern Newton County, Missouri, United States. The population was 158 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Joplin, Missouri Metropolitan Statistical Area. The village of Stella is located 17 miles southeast of Neosho.

==History==
The first known settlers of this area arrived in the early 1820s. The area of Stella was previously a fishing community called Springs. In October 1880, the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad sold a portion of what became Stella to Moses Eagle for $200. Moses Eagle&#x27;s family arrived in the area in 1844. Stella became an incorporated town in 1930. The village was named after Moses Eagle&#x27;s granddaughter. The water-powered grist mill was built in 1867 by Eagle. The Bank of Stella was established &quot;circa&quot; 1900. The area&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Amicus Curio&quot;, was started in 1901 by a doctor from Kent, Missouri, with the &quot;Stella Enterprise&quot; and the &quot;Stella Weekly Record&quot; established after that. The Horner Institute merged with the Stella Academy in 1911 and was located there until moving to Purdy in 1912. The Stella Baptist Church was established in 1886, with the actual church built &quot;circa&quot; 1911, the Stella Methodist Church &quot;circa&quot; 1896, while the Stella Church of Christ was established after 1950.

The Lentz-Carter Merchandise Store was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.

==Cardwell Hospital==

===Clarence C. Cardwell===
Despite Stella&#x27;s small size, for nearly 60 years the Cardwell Hospital, later the Cardwell Memorial Osteopathic Hospital, attracted people from the largely rural surrounding areas of Newton County, Barry County and McDonald County for their healthcare needs. Cardwell Hospital was opened in 1920 by World War I veteran Clarence C. Cardwell, who had been born only two miles outside of Stella in 1892. At first the hospital was only four rooms, but later expanded to meet the needs of the local community. By 1930 a second doctor had joined the staff at Cardwell and it had 10 beds available for patients. A fire in 1942 damaged the hospital, but Cardwell quickly had the building rebuilt. Cardwell continued running the hospital with his wife, Ida Cardwell, and their daughter, Cleta Cardwell, until his death in November 1956. At the time of his death the Cardwell Hospital was reported to have grown to 100 beds.

Following Cardwell&#x27;s death in November 1956, the Cardwell Hospital was closed for a short time, until it was purchased from Ida and Cleta Cardwell by Silas and Lillian Fountain and reopened on February 11, 1957, as the Cardwell Memorial Osteopathic Hospital. The Fountains, a married couple from Sulphur Springs, Arkansas, had both graduated from the Kansas City College of Osteopathy and Surgery. Their daughter Mary Sue Fountain served as the hospital administrator. Following her husband&#x27;s death on June 29, 1973, Lillian Fountain continued running the hospital until 1977. Lillian Fountain died on October 13, 1996.

===Hospital closure and EPA clean up===
Cardwell Memorial Osteopathic Hospital closed in 1977, but the building was soon reopened as a residential care facility owned by Don and Vera Littlefield. But this venture proved short lived and the building was vacant by the mid-1980s. After sitting empty for nearly 20 years, the residents of Stella, seeking to revive the town&#x27;s business district, proposed a plan to convert the empty hospital building into a multipurpose building complex, which would house a clinic, a library, city hall, retail space and residential units. However, due to considerable asbestos contamination at the site, the decision was made to remove the now derelict structure. Because of the nature of the contamination, the Environmental Protection Agency declared the former Cardwell Hospital building a superfund site and assisted the town in removing it. In the summer of 2006, the former Cardwell Hospital was torn down and the site was decontaminated, making it safe for other uses. Following the removal of the building, the site was redeveloped as the Stella Veterans Memorial Park, which is dedicated to veterans from the Stella area.

===Community of doctors===
During the years of the Cardwell Hospital, especially during Clarence Cardwell&#x27;s ownership, the town of Stella is thought to have produced more than 30 doctors and dentists, most of which are believed to have had experience working in the former Cardwell Hospital during their youth.

<text>The national flag of [[Burkina Faso]] () is formed by two equal horizontal bands of red (top) and green, with a yellow five-pointed star resting in the center. The flag was adopted on 4 August 1984. The flag uses the Pan-African colours of Ethiopia, reflecting both a break with the country&#x27;s colonial past and its unity with other African ex-colonies. The red is also said to symbolize the revolution and the green the abundance of agricultural and natural riches. The yellow star placed over the red and green stripes represents the guiding light of the revolution. The flag was adopted following the coup of 1983 which brought Thomas Sankara to power.

==History==
The original flag of Upper Volta, adopted at independence, contained three horizontal stripes of black, white, and red. These colours represented the three major tributaries of the Volta River, which flows south through the country: the Black Volta, the White Volta and the Red Volta. It is identical to the tricolor flag used by the German Empire from 1871 to 1918. The flag was changed when Upper Volta became Burkina Faso on 4 August 1984.

<text>Arkoe is a village in south central Nodaway County, Missouri, United States. The population was 68 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land. Arkoe lies in the very flat western plain of the One Hundred and Two River. It is six miles north of Barnard, six miles southeast of Maryville, and 7.5 miles west of Conception.

==Etymology==
The United States Board on Geographic Names in its Geographic Names Information System only lists two Arkoes in the United States (the other being in Pike County, Ohio).

One of the earliest uses of the name was in the 18th-century fantasy book &quot;The Life and Adventures of Peter Wilkins&quot; by Robert Paltock which was published in 1751 which said an Arkoe is a &quot;water surrounded with wood.&quot; The story is about a sailor named Peter Wilkins who is shipwrecked on a mysterious island inhabited by flying people called &quot;Glaws&quot; who inhabit the Arkoes. The book is a mix of adventure, romance, and social commentary, and is considered to be an early example of science fiction.

The book was adopted by humorist Gilbert Abbott à Beckett in 1846 into a London play entitled &quot;Peter Wilkins : Or, the loadstone rock and the flying Indians&quot; (although Arkoe is not mentioned in the play)

It was also adapted in 1923 in a book &quot;Peter Wilkins: Or, Harlequin Harlokin and the Flying Islanders&quot; by George Thorne.&quot;

The exact reason the community was named Arkoe is not specifically known. Arkoe adjoins the One Hundred and Two River and that is sometimes considered the reason for the name.

An 1882 history of Nodaway County incorrectly stated that the inspiration was mentioned in the Jules Verne novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas However, the name is not mentioned in the book.

==History==
The first community in the Arkoe immediate area was Bridgewater which was about a mile north of the current Arkoe. Nodaway County&#x27;s first railroad (starting out as the Missouri Valley Railroad before becoming the Kansas City, St. Joseph and Council Bluffs Railroad and ultimately becoming part of the Burlington Northern route) built two bridges across the 102 river within 1,000 feet of each on an elbow bend in the river and the county built a road bridge between the two in the same location. The railroad plotted the community of Bridgewater by the bridges in 1870 and the post office opened there. Dr. Perry H. Talbott who granted the right of way through much of the land in the area insisted that the town site be located on his property and on September 16, 1874, he and S.K. Snively laid out Arkoe. Nelson Wilson who had opened a merchandise store in Bridgewater in 1871 moved the building to Arkoe and became its first business in 1874. Other businesses followed including the railroad which moved its depot from Bridgewater to Arkoe. 
On September 18, 1880, Dr. Talbott was shot and killed at his home. His wife, Belle, and his sons Charles Edward and Albert Perry were initially suspected and arrested for his murder. Eventually, Belle was released and the sons were tried for their father&#x27;s murder. Both were convicted and sentenced to hang. They were executed in the Beal Pasture (today Beal Park), on the east side of Maryville, on July 22, 1881. News accounts estimated the number of people present at the hanging at over 10,000. The Talbott brothers&#x27; hanging is said to have been the first &quot;legal&quot; hanging in Nodaway County.

Arkoe formally incorporated in 1906.

The Arkoe post office closed in 1953.

The Arkoe rail line closed by 1979.

<text>Hopkins is a city in northern Nodaway County, Missouri, United States. The population was 472 at the 2020 Census, the third largest city in the county.

== History ==
Hopkins was laid out in 1870. The community has the name of A.L. Hopkins of the Kansas City, St. Joseph and Council Bluffs Railroad. The railroad later became the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy and finally the Burlington Northern before tracks were remove in 1983. A post office called Hopkins has been in operation since 1871.

Occult writer Grant Wallace was born in Hopkins in 1867.

The Hopkins Tornado of 1881 is believed to have been one of the first recorded F5 tornadoes.

On Sunday afternoon November 16, 1952, Hopkins was struck by a tornado which greatly damaged the downtown business district. Mary Jane Truman, sister of Harry S Truman, had appeared in the community almost to the day a year earlier. She contacted her brother who was on a yacht. Hopkins was the first town in the United States of under 1,000 people to receive federal disaster relief. The government sent the community $10,000 which was put under the administration of Wren Peve, a local businessman. Mr. Peve kept accurate track of the spending and when all the needs were met it was found that there was a surplus. Peve then wrote a check and sent that surplus back to Washington. The cleanup was under the direction of Landon Wallace; the local Ford salesman and also the Hopkins Fire Chief. During the three weeks of cleanup, most of the second floors of the downtown buildings were removed by his order.

In the first half the 20th century Rancho del Rayo which was at least 3,900 acres claimed to be the biggest hereford ranch in the state of Missouri.

In September, 1933, the Missouri Highway Patrol cornered and killed Harold B. Thornbrugh a Kansas outlaw, who at the time was living in New Market, Iowa. Thornbrugh was wanted for bank and postal robbery, the murder of Omaha Police Officer Otto Peterson and the attempted murder of Frankin County, Kansas Sheriff William Wantland. The day Harold Thornbrugh was killed in Hopkins, his brother Cecil stood before Judge Hopkins in Topeka, Kansas on the same charges pending against Harold. One officer was seriously wounded in the head during the brief gun battle.

During World War II Hopkins a town of less than 1,000 at the time lost fourteen men. This included two brothers Charles and George Russell who died in April, 1945 within twenty-four hours of each other. Charles drowned in the Pacific and George was accidentally shot in Germany while guarding prisoners of war. Carl Melvin went down with the , and Charles Pistole was killed at Tarawa while operating a landing craft. In other conflicts, Glenn Ulmer died in World War I, the American Legion Post is named in his honor and Gary Cross died in Vietnam. Hopkins suffered no deaths in Korea.

Hopkins was the final home of jockey Clive Dixon and his wife Betty June, who trained and owned the National Appaloosa Show Champion, Two-Eyed Sioux. 
Each year the town celebrates the Hopkins Picnic the second weekend in July. This has been a yearly celebration since 1888.

The last electromechanical telephone switch in the U.S. was located in nearby North Hopkins, Iowa, served by the CO in Hopkins. This switch converted to digital on September 15, 1999.

<doc id="122983" wikidata="Q957284" url="?curid=122983" title="Maryville, Missouri">
<text>Maryville is a city and county seat of Nodaway County, Missouri, United States. Located in the &quot;Missouri Point&quot; region, As of the 2020 census, the city population was 10,633. Maryville is home to Northwest Missouri State University and Northwest Technical School. Maryville is the second-largest city (behind St. Joseph, Missouri) wholly within the boundaries of the 1836 Platte Purchase which expanded Missouri&#x27;s borders into former Indian Territory in northwest Missouri.

== History ==
Maryville was platted on September 1, 1845.

Maryville&#x27;s name originates from the town&#x27;s first postmaster, Amos Graham. Graham was one of the original settlers of what would later become downtown Maryville, and the city was named after his wife, Mary. In addition to his above historical role, Graham was also one of the original Nodaway County Commissioners and served as the first county clerk when the county was formally organized in 1845. Maryville, which is near the geographic center of Nodaway County, was also named the county seat in the same year.

The first house in Maryville was built by Jack (John) Saunders, who was a large slave owner. The first courthouse was built in 1846. Formerly, county government affairs would be held in the home of an early settler, I.N. Prather. An updated courthouse was constructed in 1853, the second of only three in the city&#x27;s history. The current courthouse was built in 1881 with a design by Edmond Jacques Eckel and George R. Mann. Mann would later go on to design the Arkansas State Capitol. The courthouse is currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is adorned with a sculpture of a pineapple, the sign of welcome. The original court complex included one of the country&#x27;s only rotary jails. The jail was torn down in 1984 and replaced with a new structure on the same site.

The city was incorporated in 1856, annulled in 1857, reincorporated in 1859, annulled during the Civil War, reincorporated in 1869, disincoporated again in 1869 and finally formally incorporated on July 19, 1869, when the Kansas City, St. Joseph, and Council Bluffs Railroad (later acquired by the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad) arrived. The Wabash Railroad arrived in 1879. Both railroads no longer operate in the city and no railroads are operated anywhere in Nodaway County.

=== Missouri governors ===
In 1872 Albert P. Morehouse started the &quot;Nodaway Democrat&quot;, which became the &quot;Maryville Daily Forum&quot;. Morehouse would become governor. He lived in a house on Vine Street. Coincidentally, the house would later be occupied by Forrest C. Donnell before Donnell became a governor and U.S. Senator. The &quot;Forum&quot; was a chain-owned newspaper for nearly 100 years, and in 2013 it reverted to local ownership by the Cobb Group.

In 1889 the Maryville Methodist Seminary opened.

In 1891 Elizabeth Howell (who operated Howell Millinery in Maryville) contributed to the development of the Lazy Susan when she received an American patent for &quot;certain new and useful Improvements in Self-Waiting Tables&quot;. Howell&#x27;s device ran more smoothly and did not permit crumbs to fall into the space between the Lazy Susan and the table.

In 1894 Mary Augustine Giesen moved to Maryville and opened St. Francis Hospital.

=== Kentucky Derby connections ===
In 1901, the horse Elwood was foaled at Faustiana Farms, owned by Mrs. J.B. Prather, on the west side of Maryville. It won the Kentucky Derby in 1904 and was the first Derby winner to be bred by a woman. Faustiana was located where the Maryville Country Club is today. Mrs. Prather also has connections with the second horse to be owned and bred by a woman to win the Derby – Black Gold in 1924, which was the great grandchild of Faustus, the namesake of the Faustiana farm. Elwood and Black Gold are two of 10 Kentucky Derby winners with Nodaway County connections. Trainer Ben A. Jones won the Derby in 1938, 1941, 1944, 1948, 1949 and 1952. His son Jimmy Jones won in 1957 and 1958. They operated a horse farm at Parnell, Missouri until their deaths (although their racing fame is tied to Calumet Farm in Kentucky). Memorabilia from their horse racing days are St. Francis Hospital and at the Nodaway County Historical Society Museum.

=== Northwest Missouri State University founding ===
In 1905, Maryville won a contest to get the Fifth District Normal School, which would become Northwest Missouri State University. It offered $58,672 and , including the Methodist Seminary, to the state. The college was on the northwest corner of the city, nearly adjoining the Wabash train station. The most significant structure on the land transferred to the state was the Thomas Gaunt mansion, which is also on the National Register and is the college President&#x27;s residence. Gaunt owned an extensive nursery on his property, which was on a birch-lined street and is now the Missouri Arboretum. The most recognizable building on the campus today is the Administration Building, designed by John H. Felt. It is on the National Register and resembles Brookings Hall at Washington University in St. Louis, which was the Administration Building of the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair in St. Louis.

=== 1931 lynching ===
In 1931, a notorious lynching occurred in Maryville when a mob of 2,000 to 4,000 people burned alive African American Raymond Gunn, who was awaiting trial, charged with the attempted rape and killing of a 20-year-old white school teacher. One woman held her young girl up so the girl could get a better view of the naked man afire. A Maryville policeman directed traffic as Gunn burned. After the fire was out, hundreds of the mob poked around in his ashes for souvenirs, with the pieces of his charred remains and teeth and bone fragments divided among them. While the Sheriff said he knew who had committed the killing, nobody was ever charged.

The lynching attracted national attention and was frequently invoked in the unsuccessful campaign to pass the Costigan-Wagner Bill, which would have made it a federal crime for law enforcement officials to refuse to try to prevent a lynching.

=== Herbert Hoover connections ===
In 1928 there was speculation that Maryville would become the &quot;Western White House&quot; for Herbert Hoover when it was discovered that he owned a farm 15 miles south of town. The farm was actually only 80 acres and he had acquired it after holding the mortgage for his Stanford University Class of 1895 roommate Samuel Wilson Collins. It was Iowa-native Hoover&#x27;s only farm and Hoover visited it in 1933 after leaving office. He was accompanied by his former Secretary of Agriculture Arthur M. Hyde. Hoover&#x27;s vice president Charles Curtis visited Maryville on October 4, 1932 where spoke at the Administration Building after being rained out of a planned appearance at the Courthouse.

=== Harry Truman connections ===
Harry S. Truman (along with Bess and Margaret Truman) made the last of several visits to Maryville on August 3, 1962, when he dedicated the current post office. Truman had extensive ties to Maryville. During World War I Truman was a member of the 129th Field Artillery Regiment in the Missouri National Guard, which is headquartered in Maryville. Truman commanded Battery D in the war of the 129th. The 129th official motto is &quot;Truman&#x27;s Own&quot; because of the affiliation. During the Meuse-Argonne Offensive during World War I in 1918, Truman prophetically told his troops, &quot;&quot;Right now, I&#x27;m where I want to be – in command of this battery. I&#x27;d rather be here than president of the United States.&quot; Among the original 129th soldiers was Edward V. Condon (1893–1974) who later operated the Condon Corner Drug Store across the street on the Square after the war. Truman dedicated the 129th&#x27;s armory on the northwest side of Bearcat Stadium on the college campus on February 20, 1955.

The 1955 armory was repurposed as the Jon T. Rickman Electronic Campus Support Center in 2003, when a new armory was built further west of the campus near the Maryville Country Club, which is the site of the original Faustiana Farm complex. Many of Maryville&#x27;s most active citizens have ties to the 129th, including Leigh Wilson (1881–1978), who rose to rank of Brigadier General. Wilson, who operated the Wilson Motel in Maryville, as well as the Hitching Post restaurant, was one of the biggest proponents for broadening Maryville&#x27;s economic base away from the college.

Truman&#x27;s sister Mary Jane Truman, who was active in the Order of Eastern Star, visited Maryville and Nodaway County several times for Eastern Star events before, during and after the Truman presidency.

In 1969, Maryville received an All-America City Award.

In 1987, the Palms Bar in town began sponsoring the &quot;World&#x27;s Shortest Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade.&quot; The parades, which are less than a block long, have been getting shorter each year as other towns compete for the title. One of the mainstays of events has been a garbage truck driving down the street at the beginning, pouring out buckets of green water as a Maryville homage to the dyeing of the Chicago River green. In 2015, the parade moved from being a block off the square to actually being on the square after it became sponsored by Burny&#x27;s Sports Bar.

In 1994, Mozingo Lake opened east of Maryville. Its Mozingo Lake Golf Course has courses designed by Donald Sechrest and Tom Watson (which opened in 2016).

In 1996, the Maryville Treatment Center, a minimum security prison, opened in a renovated Franciscan Sisters of Mary Motherhouse which had been built in 1947 and has a landmark yellow steeple on the bluffs above the One Hundred and Two River on the east side of Maryville.

=== American football ===
Maryville became a football powerhouse in 1994 when Mel Tjeerdsma became coach of Northwest Missouri State Bearcats football. The Bearcats played in the 1998, 1999, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2013, 2015 and 2016 NCAA Division II Football Championship games, winning in 1998, 1999, 2009, 2013, 2015 and 2016. The basketball team won national titles in the NCAA Division II Basketball Championship in 2017, 2019 and 2021. In addition, the Maryville High School football team appeared in 1996, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, 2016 and 2017 (winning in 2009, 2012, 2013 and 2017, in addition to an earlier championship in 1982) state championship games. The history of championship victories have earned the town nickname of &quot;Title Town.&quot; The high school has the unique mascot of &quot;Spoofhounds.&quot; Both schools have green and white for their school colors. Adam Dorrel, a Maryville High graduate, succeeded his former boss Tjeerdsma when he retired as coach in 2010 and kept up the tradition winning the national titles in 2013, 2015 and 2016.

===Minor league baseball===

Maryville was home to the Maryville Comets, a minor league baseball team, in 1910 and 1911. The Comets played as members of the Class D level Missouri-Iowa-Nebraska-Kansas League.

=== 2012 sexual assault ===

A controversial case arose in 2012 when a boy, 17 at the time of the incident, was arrested for the rape and sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl. A 15-year-old boy was accused of doing the same to the girl’s 13-year-old friend, and a third boy admitted to recording the first boy&#x27;s alleged assault on a cellphone. A significant controversy arose in 2013 when the county prosecutor dropped felony and misdemeanor charges against the first boy, who was related to an influential former state representative Rex Barnett, despite the Sheriff&#x27;s office reporting absolute confidence that the evidence they had gathered being sufficient for a prosecution, including the boy&#x27;s confession recorded on video. The Nodaway County prosecutor dropped the felony sexual exploitation charge against the third boy.
 Outrage in online communities soon followed when the story surrounding this case was revisited in October 2013. National news media described the situation as &quot;horrifying&quot; and &quot;a nightmare&quot;. Michael Schaffer, reporting on the incident for &quot;The New Republic&quot;, described Maryville as a &quot;lawless hellhole&quot;. In 2014, a special prosecutor was put in charge to reinvestigate the case. The first boy pleaded guilty to misdemeanor second-degree endangerment of the welfare of a child for leaving her outside her house, and was sentenced by Missouri Circuit Judge Glen Dietrich to four months in jail that were suspended in favor of two years probation. The boy was sentenced in juvenile court for the assault. The incident is featured in the 2016 Netflix documentary &quot;Audrie &amp; Daisy&quot;.

The victim, Daisy Coleman, died by suicide on August 4, 2020. Coleman&#x27;s mother, Melinda Coleman, died by suicide about four months later, on December 6.

<text>Parnell is a city in northeast Nodaway County, Missouri, United States, near the Platte River. The population was 191 at the 2010 Census. It was home to the father-son horse trainers Ben and Jimmy Jones, whose horses won eight Kentucky Derbies and two Triple Crowns.

==History==
Parnell was platted on July 5, 1887 as a station stop on the Chicago Great Western Railway and it was formally incorporated in 1888. The Chicago Great Western route passing through the community was called the Diagonal Route. It ran at northeast direction from Kansas City to Waterloo, Iowa including passing through the community of Diagonal, Iowa. Among the first businesses was the Diagonal Hotel.

Ben Jones father Horace Jones organized the founding of the community and an early proposed names was Jonesville until it was discovered there was another Jonesville in Missouri. The name ultimately chosen was in honor or Irish politician Charles Stewart Parnell who was at the peak of influence in creating Irish homerule when Parnell was incorporated.

The elder Horace Jones started a ranch on the northeast side of Parnell where he raised Angus cattle and saddle horses. At the ranch Ben (along with his son Horace &quot;Jimmy&quot;) trained a horse named Seth which was in the top 20 of the national thoroughbred sires list from 1925 to 1928. This in turn got the attention of Herbert M. Woolf, owner of Woolford Farm in Prairie Village, Kansas and Ben trained Lawrin which won the Kentucky Derby in 1938. The two were lured by Warren Wright, Sr. to train horses at Calumet Farm in 1939 where they racked up a record training 7 Kentucky Derby winners (1941, 1944, 1948, 1949, 1952, 1957, 1958) and two Triple Crown winners (Whirlaway and Citation). Ben&#x27;s record of 6 wins remains a Derby record. He was succeeded by Jimmy as trainer and Jimmy was the trainer of record for the 1957 and 1958 wins although Ben stayed on as Calumet manager until 1961. Jimmy stayed at Calumet until 1964 when he became manager of racing at Monmouth Park.

After he retiring in 1976 Jimmy returned to 1,750 acre ranch in Parnell. He sold the ranch in 1986. He had no children and died in Maryville, Missouri in 2001. He left $7.2 million to St. Francis Hospital there.

<text>Skidmore is a city in western Nodaway County, Missouri, United States. The population was 245 at the 2020 Census. Skidmore also has a yearly &quot;Punkin&#x27; Show.&quot;

==History==
The Skidmore area was first settled in 1840 by William Bunton shortly after the Platte Purchase opened the area to settlement. Skidmore itself was platted in 1880 when M. Skidmore donated to the Nodaway Valley Railroad Company (the agent for the Kansas City, St. Joseph and Council Bluffs Railroad which was eventually taken over by the Burlington Northern Railroad). The railroad no longer operates.

The St. Oswald&#x27;s Protestant Episcopal Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.

==Crime==

On July 10, 1981, Ken McElroy was shot to death with at least two different guns while sitting in his truck in front of the D&amp;G Tavern in town. Up to 50 individuals witnessed the event, all of whom denied seeing anything that would help police identify any of the shooters. McElroy&#x27;s wife saw one of the gunmen and identified him. The prosecutor took the case to two grand juries, but neither one thought any crime had been committed so there was no indictment. As of 2021, the murder has not been solved and still is considered an open case. McElroy had a reputation as the &quot;town bully,&quot; and he had fended off over 20 charges for acts of theft, rape, and other violence (often by means of witness intimidation). In the months before his death, he was appealing a light sentence for shooting a 70-year-old grocer, Bo Bowenkamp, in the neck. Town residents had been upset over the inability of the courts to deal with him. Author Harry N. MacLean recounted the incident and its background in a bestselling and award-winning book, &quot;In Broad Daylight&quot;. In 1991 the incident was portrayed in a made-for-TV movie starring Brian Dennehy and Cloris Leachman (although filmed in Texas). The Ken McElroy shooting was also the focus of the A&amp;E Network program &quot;City Confidential&quot;, season 2, episode 22 entitled, &quot;Skidmore: Frontier Justice&quot;.

On October 16, 2000, Greg N. Dragoo beat and dragged his girlfriend, Wendy Gillenwater, down several country roads outside of Skidmore, causing her to die. Gillenwater&#x27;s body was found outside her Skidmore home. Dragoo was charged with murder and given a life sentence by a Nodaway County judge. Dragoo is currently incarcerated in the Jefferson City Correctional Center.

On April 11, 2001, Branson Perry vanished under mysterious circumstances from his residence at 304 West Oak Street in Skidmore. Perry&#x27;s grandmother, Jo Ann, stopped by his home and found the house unlocked and deserted. She found this unusual and called the residence periodically over the next several days, but got no answer. Upon calling Perry&#x27;s mother, Rebecca Klino, she found she had not spoken to him either. Ground search parties were organized by Nodaway County Sheriff&#x27;s Office within a 15-mile (24 km) radius of the Perry residence. Numerous fields, farms, and abandoned buildings were searched, but the efforts proved fruitless. His disappearance received national media coverage. Over the following month and a half, over one hundred people were interviewed in Perry&#x27;s disappearance, but the case remains unsolved. On August 14, 2022, Nodaway County Sheriff Randy Strong announced their department had identified a suspect, but still needed more evidence before making an arrest.

On December 16, 2004, Skidmore was once again the focus of national attention when Bobbie Jo Stinnett, a cousin of Branson Perry, was murdered in her home located at 410 W. Elm Street. She had her unborn baby cut from her womb, which was found alive two days later in Topeka, Kansas, and delivered to the father by police. The killer, Lisa Montgomery, received a federal death sentence, and was executed early in the morning on January 13, 2021.

==Geography==
Skidmore is located at on Missouri Route 113 approximately two miles north of the Nodaway-Holt county line. The Nodaway River flows past the west side and the confluence of Florida Creek with the Nodaway is just north of the community. Maryville is approximately eleven miles to the east-northeast.

<text>Caruthersville is a city in and the county seat of Pemiscot County, Missouri, United States, located along the Mississippi River in the Bootheel region of the state&#x27;s far southeast. The population was 5,562, according to the 2020 census.

==History==
Caruthersville lies in Missouri&#x27;s Bootheel on the Mississippi River. The word &quot;Pemiscot&quot; comes from the word meaning &quot;liquid mud&quot; in the Fox language. Mississippi waters have frequently flooded the flatlands, creating fertile alluvial land valued for farming. Settling the floodplain has resulted in periodic problems for residents, as there are regular floods despite (and because of) elaborate constructed systems of levees and flood controls.

Native Americans inhabited the land of the Caruthersville area for thousands of years before European settlement. The Mississippian culture built huge earthwork mounds throughout the Mississippi Valley. One such earthwork remains in this county, rising 270 feet above sea level about four miles southwest of Caruthersville. It stands in contrast to the surrounding delta-like plain.

In 1857 John Hardeman Walker and G. W. Bushey laid out and platted the town of Caruthersville. The town was named for Samuel Caruthers, who first represented the area in the US Congress.

The City of Caruthersville was incorporated on May 18, 1874. The first few decades of the town&#x27;s growth can be documented through Sanborn maps, which recorded building ownership, materials, and use.

In 1893, Missouri&#x27;s General Assembly created the Saint Francis Levee District to construct protection for that part of the Saint Francis River basin lying within the counties of Dunklin, New Madrid, and Pemiscot. This act authorized taxes for the purpose of building, repairing, protecting, and maintaining levees in the district.

===20th century to present===
White violence against African Americans increased in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as they were pushing them out of the political system and voting across the South. Whites lynched four men in Caruthersville: D. Malone and W.J. Mooneyhon on May 3, 1903; and A.B. Richardson and Benjamin Woods on October 11, 1911.

Steel cages are one of the oldest form of enclosures used in professional wrestling. The earliest known &quot;steel cage matches&quot; of any kind took place on January 9, 1936 in Caruthersville, Missouri, in a card that included two such &quot;chicken wire fence&quot; matches between Lon Chaney and Otto Ludwig, and Joe Dillman vs. Charles Sinkey. These matches took place in a ring surrounded by chicken wire, in order to keep the athletes inside, and prevent any potential interference.

In February 1969, construction began on a bridge across the Mississippi at Caruthersville. Completed in 1976 and connecting with Dyersburg, Tennessee, it is the only bridge to cross the Mississippi River between Cairo, Illinois and Memphis, Tennessee. It is a single-tower cantilever bridge carrying Interstate 155 and U.S. Route 412.

During the night of April 2, 2006, 60% of Caruthersville was severely damaged or destroyed by a string of tornadoes that passed through the Midwestern United States. At least two persons were confirmed killed in Pemiscot County as a result of the tornado. On Monday morning, local police, state troopers, and National Guard had barred entrance into Caruthersville and issued it as a &quot;no fly zone&quot; to anyone who was not a resident, an emergency worker, or a member of the newsmedia. According to the emergency management director from a nearby county, as many as 1,500 people were displaced by the storm, which struck the southwest side of the city.

As reported by Caruthersville&#x27;s then-mayor, Diane Sayre, there were no confirmed fatalities within city limits, but electricity and water services were disabled. Several churches, landmarks, and schools were destroyed or severely damaged, including St. John&#x27;s Episcopal, Jesus Name Tabernacle, Faith Missionary Baptist, Caruthersville Municipal Airport, Caruthersville Cotton Warehouse, the Boy&#x27;s and Girl&#x27;s Club of the Bootheel, Knox&#x27;s Drive In, the Kwik Chek, Caruthersville High School, and Caruthersville Middle School.

==Geography==
The city is located in the state&#x27;s Bootheel, along the western bank of the Mississippi River and within the seismically active New Madrid Seismic Zone. The Caruthersville Bridge is the only bridge crossing the river between Cairo, Illinois and Memphis, Tennessee.

<text>Altenburg is a city in Perry County, Missouri, United States. The population was 341 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Altenburg (German for &quot;Old Castle&quot;) was laid out and platted in 1839 by a colony of Lutherans. It was named after the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg from where many of its settlers came, and not the city of Altenburg which does not seem to have sent a single colonist.

Altenburg is one of seven towns and villages in the area founded by German Lutheran immigrants in 1839. Altenburg and the other communities—Dresden, Frohna, Johannisberg, Paitzdorf, Seelitz, and Wittenberg—were all named by settlers for towns in the Saxony region of their native country. These settlers would form the backbone of what would later become the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod. Trinity Lutheran Church was established in 1839 in a log cabin, and was later replaced by a limestone, and then a frame church. Soon after arriving, the immigrants constructed a school in Altenburg. Made of native timber, this &quot;Log Cabin College&quot; introduced the new idea of a co-educational school, a rarity at the time. Today, Altenburg is home to the Lutheran Heritage Center and Museum, established in 1985. Tourists can explore several mid-19th century buildings that remain in the community as well as the Heritage Center&#x27;s exhibition hall as well as the reading room and research library.

<text>Lithium is a census-designated place and former village located in Perry County, Missouri, United States. The population was 92 at the 2020 census. The 2000 Census found Lithium to have zero residents; an Associated Press article, however, stated that about 50 people in fact resided there, but may have been counted as part of Perry County&#x27;s rural population.

Lithium had a ZIP Code of 63775, but it has since been declared by the USPS to be &quot;Not Acceptable - Use Perryville.&quot;

==Etymology==
Lithium&#x27;s location is due to two natural mineral springs; one of the two springs contained lithium salts, giving the town its name.

==History==
Lithium was first surveyed as a town in 1882. The first settlers were Dr. Henry Clay Fish, Richard P. Dobbs and James G. Christian, who all came to Missouri from Illinois. The town was incorporated in 1883 and the first mayor was Richard C. Lisenby. The location of the town was determined by two mineral springs, which were highly prized on account of their medicinal qualities, which led to the construction of a bath house by Thomas King in 1883. A Baptist church, Lithium Baptist, was organized in 1885 and a Catholic church, St. John the Evangelist, was organized in 1896. By 1912 the town had two general stores, two mills, a brick yard and population of 98.

<doc id="123017" wikidata="Q958819" url="?curid=123017" title="Longtown, Missouri">
<text>Longtown is a village in Union Township in Perry County, Missouri, United States. The population was 90 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Some of the earliest Europeans to put down roots in the area were English and Scotch-Irish Presbyterian settlers from Rowan, Iredell, Cabarrus, and Mecklenburg counties in North Carolina who settled to the south in Brazeau in 1817. Soon after, in 1821, they were followed by English and Scotch-Irish Methodists also hailing from North Carolina, settling in the present area of Longtown. Among the earliest families were the Abernathys, Farrars, and Rutledgers. These settlers were part of a large exodus from the Piedmont region of North Carolina following the War of 1812. In 1826 these settlers built their first log meeting house which was replaced with York Chapel Methodist church in 1836.

The settlement was initially known as the “Abernathy Settlement”, although at this point the settlement could not be considered an organized community, as the population lay scattered on farms in the surrounding area. Emil Urban and Oliver Abernathy were the first merchants in the settlement. By 1860 a core community had formed along the King’s Road (French: Le Chemin du Roi, Spanish: El Camino Real), known today as King’s Highway, but also known then as the Perryville-Jackson Road.

In April 1874 the town had been incorporated as &quot;Longtown&quot;. Two theories abound to the origin of the name. One early explanation gives that the town was named after a German couple that immigrated to the area – Johann and Maria Lang (Lang being German for ‘long’). The other explanation given is that the town was named after John Long, one of the earlier settlers. The first mayor was Velentine Bergmann. A post office was established in 1883 (closing in 1966).

Up until 1881 the Protestant German population had been members of the Frieden (Peace) Lutheran Congregation in nearby Friedenberg. However, due to the dirt roads becoming impassable in wet seasons or freezing temperatures in winter, the need for a local church had grown. In 1882, Rev. A.G. Wetzel organized the Cross Congregation Lutheran Church, Ohio Synod, in the school house in Longtown with former members of the Peace Lutheran Congregation of Friedenberg who followed the distinctive teachings of the Ohio Synod. However, the church faced poor prospects because of limited membership.

Another Lutheran church - Zion Lutheran Church Missouri Synod - was established in 1897 with Rev. G.D. Hamm acting as the first pastor. The original Zion Lutheran church was built of wood, but by 1912 had been replaced by the present brick church.

By 1883, the members of Cross Lutheran church had been asked to leave the schoolhouse as the building belonged to &quot;Longtowners&quot;. 
Rev. Wetzel moved to a different location, more north-east of Longtown and organized and built the Cross Lutheran Church, Ohio Synod. The small church only existed for 15 years from 1883 to 1898. Only the small Cross Cemetery remains along country road #316.
In the early part of the 20th century Longtown had a population of 158, with two churches, a public school, three general stores, a bank, a tavern and a flouring mill, and had largely remained a farming community. On April 20, 1936, the Hacker &amp; Funke General Store and Barbershop had suffered severe fire damage. In 1946 the Friedenberg Parochial School consolidated with the Longtown Parochial School. In 1981 a fire completely destroyed the Wallace Hacker General Store.

<text>Perryville is a city in Perry County, Missouri, United States. The population was 8,555 at the 2020 United States census. Perryville is the county seat of Perry County.

==History==
Perryville was selected the county seat of Perry County by Robert T. Brown, Joseph Tucker, and Thomas Riney, who had been appointed to select the seat of justice. In 1821, Bernard Layton deeded to the commissioners in exchange for one town lot. Fifty-three of the 99 town lots were sold for $1,486.25, which was used to build the first courthouse. The current courthouse is the third such structure. It was built in 1904 at a cost of $30,000. Perryville and Perry County were named for Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry, Naval hero of the War of 1812.

An early store in Perryville was a log structure built by Jean Ferdinand Rozier on the north side of the square. An extant two-story brick building was built in 1830. The upper story serves as the first town hall. Perryville was first incorporated in 1837, but the incorporation was allowed to lapse.

As both merchandisers and consumers grew in sophistication, so did the types of establishments in the county. Built in 1843, the Hoose Hotel, often called the &quot;white house&quot;, was a prominent structure in early commercial days. The Hoose Hotel served as a hotel, a brewery and an auction block.

In 1856, the town was again incorporated and by 1874 it had its first fire engine. Fourth Class City status was attained in 1879 and the following year Charles A. Weber was elected its first mayor. With the building of the Chester, Perryville and Ste. Genevieve Railway, prosperity came.

Largely because of its role as the seat of county government and because of its central location, Perryville began to develop as the major commercial and service center in Perry County. The population increased from 897 in 1890 to 1275 in 1900. Telephone service started in 1893.

<text>Standing on the Verge of Getting It On is the sixth studio album by Funkadelic, released on Westbound Records, released in July 1974. It is notable for featuring the return of guitarist Eddie Hazel.

On this album, the lyrics generally take a backseat to the music and the jamming. It is one of the most popular Funkadelic albums among fans, and highlights the virtuosic guitar of the returning Eddie Hazel, who had departed following 1971&#x27;s Maggot Brain. Hazel co-wrote all of the album&#x27;s songs, although the songwriting credits were mostly in the name of Grace Cook, Hazel&#x27;s mother (a gambit by Hazel to avoid contractual difficulties with the publishing rights).

Ned Raggett writes in AllMusic that &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s Got a Little Bit of Bitch in Him&quot; is a &quot;friendly&quot; song about &quot;a gay friend&quot; and notes that this stands in contrast with later negative attitudes towards homosexuality among hip hop artists who often sampled P-Funk songs.

Note: on songs 2–7, Eddie Hazel&#x27;s songwriting credit was in the name of his mother, Grace Cook.

==Song information==

===“Red Hot Momma”===
This song is a remake of a song by Parliament while the band was signed to Invictus Records. The title of this song has been spelt in three different ways on various Parliaments, Funkadelic, and Parliament releases that have featured a version of the song, with the final word being spelled as &quot;Mama,&quot; &quot;Mamma,&quot; or &quot;Momma.&quot;

The guitar solo and jam that conclude this song were continued in the studio, and ended up as a B-side titled &quot;Vital Juices,&quot; featuring guitar work by Eddie Hazel and Ron Bykowski. That track is found on Westbound compilation CD &quot;Music For Your Mother: Funkadelic 45s&quot; as well as the recent CD reissue of the original album.
