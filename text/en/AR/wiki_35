<text>Presque Isle Township is a civil township of Presque Isle County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 1,698 at the 2020 census.

==Communities==
Presque Isle is a small unincorporated community located within Presque Isle Township along Lake Huron. It is approximately 15 miles north of Alpena, and 15 miles south of Rogers City.

The community and the township are named for Presque Isle (literally, &quot;almost an island&quot;) which is French for &quot;peninsula&quot;. This peninsula, for which the entire county is named, sits in the northern part of the township and is home to two historic lighthouses. Only one narrow strip of land, a tombolo, at the southern end of the peninsula connects it to the mainland. Sunrise and sunset over Lake Huron are both viewable from the sandy beaches along this strip of land. Presque Isle Harbor Marina, a restaurant, and a gift shop are located there as well. The community of Presque Isle is located a few miles south of this peninsula and includes a post office, seasonal gas station, chapel, community center, library, and a historic inn, the Presque Isle Lodge. The community sprung up around the homestead of John Kauffman, which currently serves as the community center. As early as the 1880s Presque Isle was frequented by hunters, fisherman, and summer vacationers and eventually the Fireside Inn, Birch Hill Hotel, and Grand Lake Hotel were built at the turn of the century to meet this demand.

The Old Presque Isle Lighthouse, built in 1840, is located at the north end of Presque Isle Harbor; according to local legend, it is haunted. The New Presque Isle Lighthouse was built in 1870 and is the tallest climbable tower on the Great Lakes. Both lighthouses have museums, open seasonally to the public. The 1870 lighthouse museum houses a beautifully preserved Third Order Fresnel Lens which remained active in the tower until recent years. Both lighthouses guided sailors to Presque Isle Harbor, the only natural harbor between Detroit and Mackinac, and a critically important wooding station on Lake Huron in the days before coal burning steamships. The many reefs and rocky shoals up and down the coast from Presque Isle Harbor are home to dozens of shipwrecks within the protected waters of Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary, which now extends from Alcona County to Cheboygan County.

Presque Isle is also home to Camp Chickagami, a boys&#x27; camp on Lake Esau opened in 1929 and currently owned and operated by the Episcopal Diocese of Eastern Michigan.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 47.2 square miles (122.2 km), of which 35.6 square miles (92.2 km) is land and 11.6 square miles (30.0 km) (24.57%) is water. Because of its irregular shape, the civil township includes land from portions of two survey townships. Lafarge Presque Isle Quarry (formerly Stoneport, an open-pit limestone quarry) lies along Lake Huron between Presque Isle Harbor and False Presque Isle and is the township&#x27;s largest employer.

Presque Isle Township contains two nearly identical seven mile long inland lakes, Grand Lake and Long Lake. Each lake is over 5000 acres. Both lakes have been featured twice on the Outdoor Channel program Major League Fishing for their excellent large and smallmouth bass fishing. Grand Lake has upwards of a dozen islands, and both lakes feature &quot;Sandies&quot; or sandbars where boaters gather on weekends.

<text>Houghton Lake (; ) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Roscommon County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 5,294 during the 2020 census, making it the largest unincorporated community in Northern Michigan. The CDP is located within Denton, Lake, and Roscommon townships.

The community of Houghton Lake is named after and situated upon Houghton Lake, the largest inland lake in Michigan. It includes the unincorporated community of Houghton Lake Heights. The CDP of Prudenville is immediately east of Houghton Lake. M-55 is the primary thoroughfare serving the community, running east–west.

==History==
The area around Houghton Lake has been occupied for thousands of years and is within Odawa and Ojibwe homelands. In the Treaty of Washington of 1836, the Odawa and Ojibwe ceded nearly 16 million acres of their land to the United States in the eastern Upper Peninsula and northwest Lower Peninsula. The following year, Michigan gained statehood, and the area became part of Midland County. The treaty was enacted amid rapid surveying of the Lower Peninsula, including the land around Houghton Lake. The lake was first recorded as Red Lake by surveyor John Brink in 1838. During an 1852 resurvey of the county, the lake was renamed to Houghton Lake, in honor of Michigan&#x27;s first state geologist, Douglass Houghton.

The first settlers of European descent arrived and settled in 1869. This family, the Emerys, traveled the Saginaw Trail, which would continue to be a primary route for settlers. By 1873, the settlement of Houghton Lake was established. The following year, Roscommon County was established and Houghton Lake was chosen as county seat. This would last until 1878, when the courthouse was relocated to Higgins Lake.

Lumbering had shaped the early development of Houghton Lake. In the mid-1800s, lumber camps in the area were abundant, and roads, towns, and railways were established to support the lumber trade. Logs were floated from Houghton Lake down the Muskegon River to sawmills and shipping facilities in Muskegon. It has been estimated that in 1860 alone, mills on the Muskegon River produced 75,000,000 board feet of lumber.

By the late 1800s, lumbering became the primary industry in the area. As lumber camps sprung up around sawmills, more settlers arrived. Around 1883, a community at Houghton Lake was created.

The lumber industry declined in the early 1900s, leading to the repurposing of railways that were previously used for the transportation of lumber. They were now designated as passenger lines, taking outdoorsmen to fish, hunt, and experience the beauty of the &quot;north country.&quot; The Houghton Lake fishery became renowned and attracted visitors.

By the mid-1900s, Houghton Lake had gained a reputation as a desirable resort area. Today, thousands of seasonal cottages, year-round homes, and businesses line the lake. Houghton Lake remains a popular vacation spot in Michigan, attracting thousands of visitors to its shores each year.

In 1927, the &quot;Johnson Dance Hall,&quot; presently known as &quot;The Playhouse,&quot; was erected and served for many years as the entertainment center for the area. The Playhouse and the surrounding property are now home to The Houghton Lake Historical Society, as well as the yearly event &quot;Historic Village Days.&quot;

The town was struck by a windstorm on June 11, 1932, which killed four people. During a snowstorm that caused reduced visibility, two married couples died when they drove their cars into the frozen lake on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1957. The Limberlost Hotel, situated on the shore of Houghton Lake, was destroyed by a fire in 1968 causing one injury but no deaths. Two men drowned in a snowmobile accident during a carnival on the frozen lake in 1980.

<text>Prudenville is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Roscommon County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 1,643 at the 2020 census. Prudenville is located within Denton Township.

==History==

The area received its first post office on September 6, 1875 under the name Prudenville, and it was soon changed to the name Edna on January 10, 1876. The name Edna existed until it was changed back to Prudenville on January 14, 1886. The Prudenville post office was discontinued on August 15, 1911, but reestablished 10 years later on August 30, 1921. The post office remains in operation and is located at 899 West Houghton Lake Drive (M-55).

The Homestead Act of 1862, which granted free land to travelers moving west, prompted settlers to the Prudenville area in 1870 due to its plentiful lumber resources. The growing community was named after early developer Peter Pruden, and the community grew to include a post office, two hotels, many businesses, and a school. In 1882, the Roscommon Lumber Company built a &quot;stand-alone&quot; trestle railroad to assist logging crews in pushing timber into the east bay of Houghton Lake. The logs were floated across the lake into the draining Muskegon River and further down the river to the mills of Muskegon on the shores of Lake Michigan. During its operation from 1882 to 1887, the company employed 700 workers and logged 175 million board feet of white and Norway pine.

In 2004, the Roscommon Lumber Company and the community of Prudenville were dually listed as a Michigan State Historic Site. A historic marker was dedicated in Trestle Park on September 6, 2014.

<text>Chesaning ( ) is a village in Saginaw County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 2,394 at the 2010 census. The village is located within Chesaning Township.

==History==

The first mention of Chesaning in the written pages of history is the Saginaw Treaty, signed in 1819. This treaty was between members of the Saginaw Tribe, Chippewa Indians, and the government of the United States. They established a number of reservations, including along the banks of the Shiawassee River known as &quot;Big Rock Reserve.&quot; Chesaning is a Chippewa word meaning &quot;big rock place&quot;. The treaty continued in effect until 1837 when a second treaty led to the reserve being surveyed and offered for sale in 1841. The first land was sold at $5 per acre to brothers Wellington and George W. Chapman, and Rufus Mason. After making their land purchase, they traveled back to Massachusetts and moved their families to their new wilderness home by late summer of 1842.

During the months they had been away from their land, several settlers had moved into the area, building a dam and a sawmill. A few years later, a grinding mill was added. The new settlers named their community &quot;Northampton&quot; in honor of the home they had left in Massachusetts. In 1853, the legislature changed the name to Chesaning, the traditional name for the village and township. The first township elections, held in 1847, are considered to be the official birthday of the community. The village, first surveyed in 1851, was organized in 1869. The early business community was located on the east side of the river. The forest setting provided an abundance of lumber, which was used to construct many stores. However, the use of coal heating systems often caused major fires, which destroyed entire blocks of stores. The fires and the arrival of the railroad on the west side community influenced the business area to move on the west side of the river.

The Owosso and Saginaw Navigation Company, organized in 1857 to move merchandise by barge up and down the river, began construction of a canal and lock on the east side of the dam for hauling goods on the river. The river continued to be important for commercial use until the railroad arrived in Owosso. The railroad through Chesaning, built in 1867, was first surveyed to be built approximately three miles west of Chesaning, going directly from Oakley to St. Charles. Luckily, Wellington Chapman donated $18,000, a considerable sum at the time, to the railroad to secure a rail line through Chesaning. The rail was very important to the economy of the village.

==Education==
Education in Chesaning had its beginnings during the summer of 1843 when a small board shanty was built on the east side of the river. Eliza Ann Smith was the first teacher. She had 11 pupils, which included her five younger brothers. The first school year was brought to an end when a heavy rainstorm flooded the building and sent the teacher and pupils fleeing to higher ground. The school moved several times over the years, until 1869, when a brick school was built for $14,000. The building was enlarged a few years later. Then a second brick school was constructed on the site of the first brick school and opened in 1918. A gymnasium was added to the school in 1938 and a few years later, a band room. The present high school opened in 1959 and had a capacity of 1,000 students. The building was later enlarged to accommodate 1,200 students. Today, Chesaning Union Schools consists of a high school, a middle school and one elementary school. The district includes a large rural area.

Zion Lutheran School is a grade school (Pre-K-8) of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod in Chesaning.

==Local media==
Chesaning&#x27;s local newspaper is the &quot;Tri-County Citizen&quot;. Founded in 1983, it is a weekly free paper delivered to over 19,000 area homes. Many residents also subscribe to &quot;The Saginaw News&quot;, &quot;The Bay City Times&quot;, the &quot;Flint Journal&quot;, or the &quot;Argus-Press&quot; out of neighboring Owosso.

Chesaning is an important location for broadcasters in Mid-Michigan, with the community being home to three nearly 1,000 foot communications towers. Flint&#x27;s WJRT-TV and WSMH as well as Saginaw&#x27;s WAQP have their antennas and transmitters south of Chesaning. The location gives broadcasters the ability to transmit strong signals to Flint, Saginaw, Bay City, and Lansing.

<doc id="118982" wikidata="Q261711" url="?curid=118982" title="Frankenmuth, Michigan">
<text>Frankenmuth ( ) is a city in Saginaw County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 4,987 at the 2020 census. The city is surrounded by Frankenmuth Township.

The city&#x27;s name is a combination of two German words: for the region of Franconia in Bavaria from which the original settlers came, and (formerly spelled as &quot;Muth&quot;) which means &quot;courage&quot;. Thus, the name Frankenmuth means &quot;courage of the Franconians&quot;.
The most popular nickname is &quot;Little Bavaria&quot;,
in reference to the city&#x27;s German heritage.

==History==
The area was settled and named by conservative Lutheran immigrants from Roßtal area of Franconia in Germany. The group of settlers left Germany aboard the &quot;Caroline&quot; on April 20, 1845, and arrived at Castle Garden in New York seven weeks later. They traveled via canals and the Great Lakes from New York to Detroit and arrived in August 1845. Sailing then on the &quot;Nelson Smith&quot;, the settlers made their way to Saginaw and traveled over land to what is now the city of Frankenmuth.

The purpose of the settlement was primarily religious. The Lutheran group planned to start a mission among the Native Americans. One of the first large buildings was a church. However, their attempts to convert the local groups failed because most of the Native Americans were forced away within a few years.

The settlers selected a hilly area that reminded them of their native Mittelfranken and began building rough shelters there. Frankenmuth was to be an exclusively German Lutheran community. The colonists pledged to remain loyal to Germany, specifically the Kingdom of Bavaria (), and to be faithful to the German language. Germans continued arriving until the start of the Second World War.

The community was originally part of Bridgeport Township and later Frankenmuth Township, Frankenmuth became a village in 1904. In 1938, the village hired its first village manager, Herbert L. Keinath. The village was incorporated as a city on October 1, 1959, with Keinath becoming city manager.

The nearby villages of Frankenlust, Frankentrost, and Frankenhilf (now known as Richville) further illustrate that the area remained a magnet for other Germans emigrating from the same region. The German, and in particular, Franconian culture of the town, has been preserved and passed down through the generations. The German language is still prevalent in signage and speech, and German speakers continue to reside in the town. In addition, the church of St. Lorenz offers monthly services in the German language.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The Cass River passes through the town.

The event was also moved at that time into September to coincide with the opening of the Munich event. Also, for the first time in its history, the world-famous Hofbräuhaus brewery of Munich exported its beer to the United States. Local businessman Fred Schumacher, who later became president of Hofbräuhaus of America, handled the arrangements for getting the beer to Frankenmuth in time for the Oktoberfest. Frankenmuth&#x27;s Oktoberfest is considered one of the most important and popular autumn festivals in the United States.

==Places of interest==

Though completed in 1979, the two-lane structure was constructed using traditional covered-bridge timber framing techniques. The floor joists and three-span Town lattice truss system of the bridge are made of of Douglas Fir, and the decking of of planks. The area receiving the greatest wear is of oak, while the remainder is spruce. Approximately of Douglas Fir make up the rafters, and the roof is shingled with cedar. An additional of pine was required for the bridge side boards. The 230-ton structure was built in place on the east bank of the river, then pulled into position over the river with a capstan and pulleys. It is wide enough to accommodate two pedestrian walkways in addition to auto traffic.

<text>Freeland is a census-designated place in Tittabawassee Township, Saginaw County in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is part of the Saginaw-Midland-Bay Metropolitan Area. As of the 2000 census, the CDP population was 5,147. The CDP covers an area in the central portion of Tittabawassee Township. The Freeland post office, ZIP code 48623, serves nearly the entire township, as well as portions of Midland and Williams townships to the north, Frankenlust and Kochville townships to the east, Thomas and Richland townships to the south, and Ingersoll Township to the west.

It is the location of MBS International Airport, which serves three major nearby cities: Saginaw, Bay City and Midland.

It is also the location of the Saginaw Correctional Facility, which is a level I, II and IV maximum security prison.

==History==
The place was home to Native Americans long before the arrival of European settlers. In the 1819 Treaty of Saginaw, in which the Chippewa, Ottawa, and Pottawatomi ceded a large portion of land including Saginaw County to the United States federal government. In that treaty, within the ceded territory, several tracts were reserved for specific groups of Chippewa. One such tract, Black Bird&#x27;s Village, consisted of on the Tittabawassee (named as the Tetabawasink river in the text of the treaty), very near to the present location of Freeland.

In the 1850s, lumbering outposts developed in the area, one of which was called &quot;Loretta&quot;, which was given a post office named &quot;Jay&quot; in April 1856. The office was named for the first postmaster, Jefferson Jaqruth. This outpost was very nearly at the geographical center of Tittawabasse Township. Another settlement was placed just a little to the north. in 1867, one resident of the second locale, George Truesdale, instigated moving the post office from Loretta to his settlement, which retained the name of Jay for several years afterwards.

The name of Freeland comes from &quot;Mammy Freeland&quot; who operated a popular tavern on the river, frequented by lumbermen and rivermen, who came to refer to the entire settlement as Freeland. The name of the post office was changed to Freeland in January 1879. It was also a station on the Pere Marquette Railroad. By another account (Moore), the Freeland family name was prominent in business and politics of the area.

During World War II, the airport now known as MBS international was used to hold German and Japanese prisoners of war.

In 1985, Freeland&#x27;s Lions Clubs International chapter began the annual Freeland Walleye Festival.

<text>Oakley is a village in Saginaw County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 290 at the 2010 census. The village is within Brady Township, although about half of the village would lie within Chesaning Township on the east, if the boundary line had not been adjusted.

==History==
Originally the area was called Mickleville. Philip Mickle, who owned a tavern there in 1842, became the first postmaster of Mickleville on March 12, 1856. That post office was moved to the hamlet of Havana on April 18, 1860, which was two miles southeast of Oakleys present location. In 1868, Andrew Huggins plotted and recorded the village of Oakley and the post office was moved from Havana. It was named for Judge Oakley of Dutchess County, New York, a relative of one of its citizens. Oakley was incorporated as a village in 1887.

In 1880 Oakley had a population of 350, one school, three dry-goods stores, two grocers, two drug stores and two hardware stores. It had a factory that employed 40 people.

==Police department==
Starting in 2009, the police department began to award donors with credentials as reserve policemen. By 2014, the department had about 100 reserve officers to protect a township with a population about 300. The reserve policemen had badges and identifications that exempted them from pistol-free zones while carrying concealed. Some seem to have also retained bulletproof vests and other equipment bought by the village with their donations.

The village disbanded its police department in September 2014 after the Michigan Township Participating Plan cancelled liability insurance for the department over concerns of its use of untrained police officers.
In October, a village official secured insurance from other sources and briefly tried to reestablish the department. This attempt was ended by a court ruling. The village has resisted requests for the names of donors to the police fund and the names of those who served as reserve officers. Issues related to the police department became important politically in the run-up to the November 2014 elections. In late November, the new town council voted to reinstate the police department.

In February 2015, press reports indicated the village had relented and made available lists of at least some of the reserve officers and donors to the village. News reports said the list were incorrect and incomplete.

<text>Saginaw () is a city in and the seat of Saginaw County, Michigan, United States. It had a population of 44,202 at the 2020 census. Located along the Saginaw River, Saginaw is adjacent to Saginaw Charter Township and considered part of Greater Tri-Cities region of Central Michigan. The Saginaw metropolitan area had a population of 190,124 in 2020, while the Tri-Cities area had 377,474 residents.

Established as a fort following the 1819 Treaty of Saginaw, Saginaw was a thriving lumber town in the 19th century. It was an important industrial city and manufacturing center throughout much of the 20th century due to its automobile and automotive parts production led by General Motors. As part of the Rust Belt, its industry and strong manufacturing presence declined, leading to increased unemployment, crime, and a population decline. Modern economic development is focused on comparative advantages in innovation, clean energy, and continued manufacturing exports. However, the city continues to have a higher proportion of manufacturing jobs than the U.S. average.

==Etymology==
The name Saginaw is widely believed to mean &quot;where the Sauk were&quot; in Ojibwe, from &quot;Sace-nong&quot; or &quot;Sak-e-nong&quot; (Sauk Town), due to the belief that the Sauk once lived there. But it is more likely that the name means &quot;place of the outlet&quot;, from the Ojibwe &quot;sag&quot; (opening) and &quot;ong&quot; (place of).

When Natives told Samuel de Champlain that the Sauk nation was on the western shore of Lake Michigan, Champlain mistakenly placed them on the western shore of Lake Huron. This mistake was copied on subsequent maps, and future references identified this as the place of the Sauks. Champlain himself never visited what is now Michigan.

==History==
===19th century===
====Early history====
The site of what later became the city of Saginaw was originally inhabited by the Anishnabeg. French missionaries and traders first appeared in the area during the late 17th century and encountered the Ojibwe (Chippewa) living in the area. The first permanent settlement by those other than Native Americans was in 1816 when Louis Campau established a trading post on the west bank of the Saginaw River. Shortly thereafter the United States established Fort Saginaw. Campau&#x27;s trading post was also inhabited by Metis.

During Michigan&#x27;s territorial period, a county and township government were organized at Saginaw. Growth of the settlement was fueled rapidly during the 19th century by the lumber industry. Saginaw was the site of numerous sawmills and served as a port for Great Lakes vessels. What is now the city of Saginaw resulted from the consolidation of the cities of East Saginaw and Saginaw City (West Side) in 1889.

====Fort Saginaw====
In 1819, Lewis Cass, in the Treaty of Saginaw, negotiated the prerogative for the United States to own and settle the area with the leaders of the Ojibwe. In 1820, Campau attempted to expand across to the east bank of the river but was rejected by the Chippewas. In 1822, the United States Army established a fort on the west bank of the Saginaw River and named it Fort Saginaw. Two companies were stationed at the fort. A group of investors purchased some land near the fort and had it platted under the name, Town of Sagana. Due to the extremely harsh seasons and illnesses, Fort Saginaw was abandoned by 1824.

By the late 1820s, the American Fur Company was operating a post at Saginaw.

Few plots were sold and after the U.S. Army pulled out, the town languished for most of the following decade. The town was re-platted in December 1830, comprising riverfront from Cass Street, on the south, to Harrison Street, and north to Jefferson. These plots sold slowly. By 1835, only 24 plots had been sold and the remainder were transferred to a new owner, who made another plat in February 1837. However, the financial crisis of the Panic of 1837 dampened interest in purchasing properties. After selling only 58 of the 407 plots, the remainder was sold again in 1841.

====Native Americans====
Saginaw was the location of the annual government payment to the Ojibwe and Ottawa of the area, starting in the 1830s. This also attracted many French-Canadian and Euro-American merchants, primarily involved in selling watered down whiskey.

====Lumber boom====

The main cause for the founding and subsequent development of Saginaw was the large demand for lumber as the United States expanded westward. A virgin growth forest principally consisting of white pine trees covered most of Michigan. The convenient access to transportation provided by the Saginaw River and its numerous tributaries fueled a massive expansion in population and economic activity. As the trees were being cut down in the region, logs were floated down the rivers to sawmills located in Saginaw, destined to be loaded onto ships and later railroad cars.

Multiple settlements comprise present-day Saginaw. On the west side of the river the first settlement around what had been Fort Saginaw developed into Saginaw, which was incorporated as a city in 1857, containing the seat of the Saginaw County government. On the east side of the river a parallel settlement, East Saginaw, developed which was incorporated first as a village in 1855, and then as a city in 1859. Also south of East Saginaw, on the east bank of the river, the village of Salina formed. Salina&#x27;s name relates to the brine that led to a growing industry of salt production in the area. Both Saginaw and East Saginaw quickly became a hub for railroad transportation in addition to ships on the Saginaw River.
Lumber production peaked by the early 1870s, but had virtually disappeared by the end of the 19th century. In addition to salt production, which experienced an eventual decline as well, growing industries, such as those supporting the area&#x27;s agriculture and manufacturing, developed.

====Consolidation====
On June 28, 1889, the Michigan state legislature passed Act 455 to consolidate the cities of Saginaw and East Saginaw into a single city. Prior to this consolidation, the nearby village of Salina had already become part of East Saginaw. The consolidation of Saginaw became effective with the election of officers on March 12, 1890.

The provisions of the city charter were established by the same act of the legislature that provided for the consolidation. Saginaw was to be governed by a city council consisting of two aldermen elected from 21 wards and a mainly ceremonial executive mayor who was to have fairly weak powers. This was to be, as numerous other elected officials, along with elected or appointed boards, controlled much of the administrative and executive functions of government. The efficient and cohesive functioning of the Saginaw city government also was constrained by remaining rivalries between residents, business owners, and politicians from the former two cities. The distinctions and rivalries between Saginaw&#x27;s east side and west side persisted into the 20th century in various forms, and continues to influence Saginaw&#x27;s social, political, economic landscape, even into the 2010s.

===20th century===
====Industrialization====

In the early 20th century, automobile production proliferated throughout Michigan, but most notably in Detroit. Other Michigan cities became suppliers to Detroit factories, sometimes with factories of their own. In Saginaw, the Jackson-Church-Wilcox Company began as a partnership in 1906 for producing steering gear under the &quot;Jacox&quot; brand. Jackson-Church-Wilcox was acquired by Buick in 1909, and as part of General Motors became the Jackson, Church and Wilcox Division, the first GM division devoted to parts production. In 1919 the Jacox division was merged with Saginaw Malleable Iron and Central Foundry into GM&#x27;s Saginaw Products Company. This formed the basis for the Saginaw Steering Gear Division, created in 1928. General Motors and other manufacturers established foundries and other automobile-related manufacturing facilities in Saginaw, for the production of chemicals and plate glass, as well as metal fabrication. This early development of a symbiotic relationship with the auto industry set the course for the future of the city.
Before the United States entered World War II, Saginaw&#x27;s industrial complex became directed towards military production. Turning its efforts to the production of munitions, ordnance and components for military vehicles made Saginaw a significant contributor to the Allies&#x27; victory. Saginaw was home to a production facility that produced .30 caliber machine guns more quickly and at lower cost than the Army thought possible, armor-piercing shells for anti-tank use, and more than half a million M1 carbine rifles for the US military during World War II, the &quot;Gun Plant&quot; that later became Steering Gear Plant 2. Saginaw Steering Gear&#x27;s Plant1 also began wartime production in 1941, concentrating on ball screws that would eventually be used in the wing flaps of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. Malleable Iron converted its production of Armasteel from engine components to gun parts and tank treads, while Grey Iron specialized in the production of magnesium for use in Pratt &amp; Whitney aeroplane engines.

Migration from across the country, particularly from the Southern United States, drastically increased Saginaw&#x27;s population during the war years and through the 1950s. This population growth included the expanded presence of African Americans and Latinos in Saginaw. Even before the end of the war, the needs of Saginaw&#x27;s growth became clear, and were met by significant investment in the city&#x27;s infrastructure. In 1947, Saginaw and the nearby city of Midland constructed a water supply pipeline drawing water from Whitestone Point in Lake Huron to meet the anticipated needs of the communities. In addition, the cities of Midland and Bay City joined with Saginaw to develop and operate an airport on the site of a former POW camp in nearby Tittabawassee Township, which eventually became MBS International Airport.

====Governance====

In 1908, a new Michigan state constitution was adopted. The new Michigan state constitution mandated increased home rule powers for local units of government, and the Michigan state legislature enacted the Home Rule Cities Act in 1909. Under this statute, cities were permitted to frame and adopt their own city charters and were given great flexibility in structuring their local governments. The government, under the 1889 charter, had continued to be inefficient and provided for much political infighting. In 1913, a new city charter was adopted with voter approval and which followed a commission form of city government that had gained in popular interest among various cities across the United States in the early 20th century. The new government consisted of five commissioners, each elected separately at-large, who served both as the city council and as the executive heads of various city government departments. One of the commissioners served as the mayor, which was a mostly ceremonial role.

The 1913 city charter was followed for little more than two decades when the voters of the city again adopted another new city charter in 1935 following the council-manager form of government. The government under the 1913 city charter retained some of the independent boards that were given authority independent of the elected city commissioners. This caused some inefficiency and political friction. The economic consequences of the Great Depression during the 1930s provided the final catalyst for municipal government reform.

In contrast to the previous government structures, the 1935 charter, having taken effect in 1936, provided for all administration of city government to be headed directly by a single officer, the city manager, who was appointed by, and accountable to a city council of nine members elected as a group by the entire city at-large. The system was designed to address two principal issues with Saginaw&#x27;s history of municipal government, the inefficiency and politics associated with having executive and administrative authority spread among many different officers and boards, and political rivalries and friction between various geographic areas of the city, mainly the east side and the west side.

====Post World War II====
In the years following World War II, the Michigan state legislature enacted laws making it increasingly difficult for incorporated cities to expand by annexing territory from neighboring townships. Townships, which had historically served an agrarian, smaller population than that of larger cities, were given the ability to provide nearly all the same services an incorporated city could. Although Midland pursued (and continues to pursue) a policy of &quot;No annexation, no water,&quot; Saginaw chose to sell water to neighboring communities under long-term contracts. This allowed the townships to further develop at the expense of the city, the limits of which changed little after consolidation in 1889–90. The unintended consequence of this choice was that Saginaw&#x27;s population stopped growing, new housing development focused on the suburban townships, and businesses eventually followed.

===21st century===

====Population decline====
Manufacturing in Saginaw declined in the latter half of the 20th century, leading to high unemployment in the city. As a result, the city&#x27;s population diminished dramatically. From 2000 to 2010, the population of Saginaw proper decreased by nearly 10,000. Michigan&#x27;s population during that period decreased by 0.6% percent, the only U.S. state to lose population during the decade of the 2000s. In addition, Saginaw has faced increasing social problems relating to poverty as a result of its high rate of unemployment. The crime rate has been a major area of concern for the community.

====Unemployment and crime====
Saginaw&#x27;s economic conditions, compounded by the Great Recession, are a significant area of concern for the city&#x27;s residents. The decline in manufacturing jobs has resulted in higher than average rates of unemployment. Property values in the city have declined, decreasing the amount the city government collects in property taxes. Unemployment in Saginaw peaked in July 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, standing at 23.5%. The unemployment rate dropped to 9.0% as of April 2015; crime has decreased as unemployment has decreased.

Saginaw consistently ranks as having one of the highest crime rates in both Michigan and the United States at large. In 2020, Saginaw had a homicide rate of 50.2 per 100,000 people, narrowly surpassing Detroit&#x27;s rate (49.7) and dwarfing the State and National Rates (7.6 and 6.5, respectively).

====Combating blight====
Unemployment and population loss in the late 20th and early 21st centuries has led to urban decay, specifically a rise in abandoned homes that provided locations for criminal activity. In recent years, city officials, law enforcement, and neighborhood watch associations have made progress in preventing this activity by heavily patrolling target areas and offering rewards for reporting illegal or suspicious activities.

Efforts to reduce blight in Saginaw increased greatly in 2013, with the United States Department of the Treasury approving a grant to demolish vacant and abandoned properties via the Michigan State Housing Development Authority. The $100 million grant contained $11.2 million set aside for Saginaw, with Detroit receiving $52.3 million, Flint $20.1 million, Pontiac $3.7 million, and the final $2.5 million going to Grand Rapids. After the grant&#x27;s approval, Saginaw city officials announced a program to purchase unwanted, abandoned structures from their owners, which would be then added to a list of homes to tear down. Officials estimate that there were nearly 1,200 homes within the city limits worthy of demolition.

Efforts to revitalize downtown increased in 2013. CBS television executive and Saginaw native David Strouse announced an investment plan in late 2013 that would save nearly an entire block of buildings slated for demolition at the intersection of Washington and Genesee, the core of downtown Saginaw. The plan called for the renovation and redevelopment of four buildings, creating market-rate apartments on the upper floors and retail space at ground level. In 2012 a similar deal was made for the Bancroft and Eddy apartments at the same intersection. Once Section8 housing, these buildings are being transformed into market-rate apartments and retail space.

Economic development in the region is focused on comparative advantages in innovation, clean energy, and continued manufacturing exports. Compared to other mid-sized communities, Saginaw has a high number of patent applications per job, and more than 81 times the average US share of jobs in photovoltaic technology research and production. The city continues to have a higher proportion of manufacturing jobs than the US average.

==Economy==
During much of the 20th century, Saginaw&#x27;s economy was dominated by manufacturing related to the automotive industry; most notably, manual transmission assemblies, steering gear boxes and power steering pumps. At the height of manufacturing in the 1960s and 1970s, the city and neighboring Buena Vista Township hosted 12 General Motors plants, an Eaton Manufacturing plant (demolished 2008) where 5,000 people produced auto parts, and numerous smaller concerns.

The General Motors plants in the county were:
* The original Jackson-Wilcox factory on Saginaw&#x27;s North Hamilton (ca. 1906), later Saginaw Steering Gear Plant 1, closed 1984, sold by GM in 1987 to Thomson Industries, still operating as of 2009.
* Chevrolet Saginaw Parts at Sixth and Washington on Saginaw&#x27;s East Side, built in 1906 as the assembly plant of the Rainier Motor Car Company, acquired by GM in 1907. Closed 1983, demolished 1984.
* Saginaw Malleable Iron on the Southwest Side (1917). Contracted to build gear housings for GM&#x27;s Jacox division (the former Jackson Wilcox company, later Saginaw Steering Gear), sold to GM in 1919, later part of Saginaw Products Division, reorganized into a new Central Foundry Division in 1946. Closed May 2007, razed in 2010 and for sale as of May 2013 by the RACER Trust, charged with disposing of abandoned GM properties.
* Chevrolet Grey Iron, on the North Side of Saginaw, opened as Central Foundry in 1918, operated by Chevrolet Division 1927–1983, thereafter by GM Powertrain Division. Operating today as Saginaw Metal Casting Operations, the only GM manufacturing division still operating in Saginaw County.
* Chevrolet Saginaw Transmission on East Genesee in Saginaw, built 1919–20 for the Michigan Crankshaft Company, acquired by GM in 1921 and placed under Saginaw Products. Transferred to Chevrolet upon the dissolution of the Crankshaft Division (ca. 1927). Home of the Saginaw 3-speed and 4-speed manual transmissions. Transferred to the Delco Moraine Division in 1984, which became Delphi Automotive in 1995. After 2007, leased and later purchased outright by TRW Automotive, operating as TRW Braking and Suspension until closing in February 2014.
* Saginaw Steering Gear Plant 2, the &quot;Gun Plant&quot; (see below) adjacent to Malleable Iron; opened March 1941, closed July 2001, razed 2002. For sale by RACER Trust as of May 2013.
* The 400-acre Saginaw Steering Gear complex in Buena Vista Township. Plant3 opened 1953 next to the then-new US-23 bypass, adding Plants 4, 5 and6 by 1966 and a seventh shortly thereafter.

* Chevrolet Nodular Iron in Buena Vista Township, built 1964–1965, entered production 1967, announced for closure 1986, closed 1988; since demolished. Property for sale by RACER Trust as of May 2013.

The Saginaw metropolitan area&#x27;s main shopping district is located in neighboring Saginaw Township along Bay Road and Tittabawassee Road north of town, where several big box stores and regional restaurant chains can be found. Also in the same area is Fashion Square Mall, a regional shopping mall anchored by JCPenney and Macy&#x27;s. Primary areas within the city of Saginaw for consumer shopping include Old Town and downtown.

==Arts and culture==

Saginaw&#x27;s entertainment hub can be found in the downtown area, where venues such as The Dow Event Center and the restored Temple Theatre offer live entertainment. The Saginaw Bay Symphony Orchestra and Saginaw Choral Society are housed in the Temple and each of these organizations performs a full concert series annually at the Temple venue. The Saginaw Historical Society is also located downtown in an elaborate castle. Nearby, the Saginaw Art Museum boasts an impressive permanent collection and recently underwent a massive renovation. The Celebration Square area of downtown boasts an authentic Japanese Tea House, the only one of its kind in Michigan. The Andersen Enrichment Center and Rose Gardens are another attraction in Celebration Square offering ongoing art exhibits, a summer jazz concert series, and winter and summer art fairs.

Downtown Saginaw has undergone a resurgence with locally-owned restaurants and coffee shops dotting the area. The downtown Saginaw area contains several office buildings from the late 19th century and early 20th century. They are located near the Saginaw Club, a social club founded in 1889. In December 2016 &quot;The Gallery: Art For Saginaw&quot; opened in the newly redeveloped downtown. At roughly 5,000 square feet it is one of the largest public art galleries in Michigan. The Downtown Farmer&#x27;s Market offers Michigan produce, flowers, and baked goods from local bakeries and will be moving to an indoor permanent location in 2017. Downtown is not to be confused with the Old Town/West Side City area located on the other side of the river and about one mile (1.6 km) southwest. Old Town has many popular bars, locally owned restaurants, and businesses. The city&#x27;s roster of local arts organizations includes Pit and Balcony, one of the oldest continuously operating community theaters in the United States, founded in 1932.

==Government==

Saginaw is classified as a Home Rule City under the Michigan Home Rule Cities Act adopting its own City Charter giving its city a council-manager form of government. The present Charter was adopted in 1935 and took effect on January 6, 1936. Pursuant to the City Charter, Saginaw is governed by a nine-member elected at-large Council. The term of office for a member of the City Council is four years commencing with the first meeting following a regular municipal election. The terms are staggered so the entire Council is not subject to re-election at the same time—either four or five members are elected in each odd-numbered year. The city levies an income tax of 1.5 percent on residents and 0.75 percent on nonresidents.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
Historically, ships were able to move along the length of the river inside the city, but fixed bridges built over the river closed access south of the northern docks.

Saginaw was a railroad hub to the Pere Marquette Railway. Freight and passenger routes radiated to Bay City to the north, Port Huron to the east, Toledo to the south, Grand Rapids and Chicago to the southwest and Ludington to the west. Grand Trunk Railroad ran trains from Bay City through Saginaw to Durand, for connections to Chicago, Detroit, Port Huron and Toronto. Most passenger routes were discontinued during the 1950s. The last route to Potter Street Station was in 1950. The station was designated a historic site in 1991. The last New York Central Railroad train (formerly Michigan Central Railroad) departed the Genesee Street Station bound for Detroit in 1964. Today, Saginaw hosts the headquarters of the Lake State Railway who continues to operate trains out of the massive former Pere Marquette Saginaw Yard to destinations that include Midland, Bay City, and Plymouth. The Huron and Eastern Railway operates the former GTW mainline through the city, which intersects with Lake State&#x27;s Midland Line at Mershon Junction. HESR also operates several lines east into the thumb region towards Vassar and Reese. The Mid-Michigan Railroad plays a bit part in the region as well, interchanging with Lake State at Paines, west of the city. The Saginaw Railway Museum, located on the west side of the city, continues to work towards the preservation of the Saginaw Bay area&#x27;s railroading history.

Saginaw is served primarily by two airports: MBS International Airport, located in nearby Freeland, and Bishop International Airport, located in Flint. Saginaw is also served by three smaller airports: Harry W. Browne Airport in adjacent Buena Vista Township, James Clements Municipal Airport in Bay City, and Jack Barstow Municipal Airport in Midland.

Interstate 75 (I-75) serves as the main arterial route for the Saginaw area while I-675 provides direct access to the center of the city from I-75. I-69 is a nearby east–west corridor providing access to the rest of the Midwestern United States and Canada. The Saginaw River runs through the middle of the city and provides access to Saginaw Bay and the rest of the Great Lakes via docks on the northern side of the city.

In the city and surrounding areas, mass transit is provided by bus under the authority of the Saginaw Transit Authority Regional Services (STARS) system. The STARS system connects to Bay City&#x27;s Bus system at Saginaw Valley State University.

Intercity Bus Service is Provided by Indian Trails, which operates a bus station on the east side of the river.

====Major highways====
* passes along the eastern side of the city through Buena Vista Charter Township.
* provides a short freeway loop through downtown Saginaw and back to I-75 through Saginaw Charter Township.
* runs from I-69 through downtown Saginaw and north to Standish.
* is a cross-peninsular road, running across the mitten and the thumb—from Port Sanilac on the Lake Huron shore, through Saginaw, and then on to Muskegon on the Lake Michigan shore. This east–west surface route nearly bisects the Lower Peninsula of Michigan latitudinally.
* passes through the western suburbs and provides a direct connection to MBS International Airport.
* runs from the Ohio border through Adrian and Owosso before ending at M-46, in the western suburbs of Saginaw. M-52 also provides an alternate connection to Lansing, Michigan&#x27;s state capitol.
* runs from M-47 to I-675.
* runs east from M-13 to Caro and Cass City and ends at M-53 in Sanilac County.
* runs from downtown Bay City to M-58 in Saginaw.

===Utilities===

The City of Saginaw gets its electricity and natural gas from Consumers Energy.

In 1929, the city opened its consolidated water works plant which replaced two separate plants that were on each side of the Saginaw river. This plant treated water brought in from the Saginaw river and piped it out to the residents as well as corner pumps for people that did not have direct connections to the system. Currently, the City of Saginaw jointly owns with the City of Midland the Saginaw-Midland Municipal Water Supply Corporation. Incorporated in 1946, this water treatment system has supplied drinking and industrial water to both cities and many surrounding areas within the county. Due to brackish water in the aquifers below both cities, a pipeline was constructed in 1948 to supply water from Lake Huron at White Stone Point, north of Au Gres to water treatment plants in Saginaw and Midland with a second pipe added by 1996. This system has played a role in the decline of the city. The City of Saginaw, in order to obtain new sources of revenue, sold water to areas outside of the city (especially to the Saginaw Charter Township). This caused numerous businesses inside the city to leave for the surrounding areas and development in the city to stagnate. The City of Midland, however, adopted a policy of &quot;No Annexation, No Water&quot; which has led to the growth of the city as well as the surrounding areas.

Saginaw Township predates its parent county. When Saginaw Township was organized as part of Oakland County in 1831, in accordance with an 1830 act of Michigan&#x27;s Territorial Legislature, it covered all of today&#x27;s Saginaw County (organized in 1835) and part of Bay, Genesee and Midland counties. As the boundaries for these counties were set, and new townships within Saginaw County organized, Saginaw Township was reduced to its present boundaries. The territory of the present City of Saginaw west of the Saginaw River was taken from Saginaw Township when the city of Saginaw was incorporated in 1857.

In May 2020, Saginaw County residents (including parts of Saginaw Township, Thomas Township, and Tittabawassee Township), along with various Midland County residents (including parts of the city of Midland, the village of Sanford, Edenville Township, Midland Township, Lincoln Township, Homer Township and Dow Chemical) were forced to evacuate due to high flooding caused by the breach of the Edenville and Sanford dams.

<text>Durand () is a city in Shiawassee County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 3,507 at the 2020 census.

In a 1967 National Educational Radio Network radio series, local seniors discussed the early 20th Century history of the town; there were at one point over 10 bars in town where locals could get alcohol and there were often fights, with men coming from other towns to fight the tough men of Durand. Residents also recalled the Ku Klux Klan burning crosses downtown and organizing rallies against local Catholic residents. The railroad was a fascination with the local children, who often got too close to the tracks and about &quot;once a generation&quot; a child would lose their life playing along the railroad tracks.

<text>Algonac ( ) is a city in St. Clair County of the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 4,196 at the 2020 census.

Incorporated as a village in 1867 and again as a city in 1967, Algonac is located at the southern end of the St. Clair River and contains a long boardwalk and riverfront park. Algonac State Park is located just north of the city. The city is also notable for the founding and headquarters of the now-defunct Chris-Craft Boats company.

==History==
Long occupied by Native American tribes, Algonac was settled in 1805 by European American John Martin, in the newly-organized Michigan Territory. The area had been known by French colonists, the first Europeans to settle here, as &quot;Pointe Du Chêne&quot; (&quot;oak point&quot;, because of local trees). The later British colonists called it Manchester. In 1836, it was the fourth village laid out by Americans along the St. Clair River. Its present name was coined by Henry Schoolcraft and applied to the area in 1843.

Most settlement did not occur until the mid-19th century and later. In 1863, the small community was described as containing &quot;a church, two or three saw-mills, a grist-mill, woollen factory, and about 700 inhabitants&quot;. It served as the center of a farming area. The economy was also based in lumbering, shipping, and trades associated with maritime activities on the Great Lakes.

The village of Algonac was within Clay Township, although the two municipalities are administered autonomously since Algonac incorporated as a city in 1967.

Algonac was the birthplace of Emily Helen Butterfield, an artist and the first woman to be licensed as an architect in Michigan. She was famous for innovations in church architecture. It was the home of Chris-Craft boat company, the maker of the first mass-produced speedboats. It was also the home of Gar Wood, the first great speed boat racer.

Algonac is home to two museums dedicated to its history. The Algonac Clay Community Museum contains many displays of Algonac&#x27;s local history. The Algonac Clay Maritime museum displays the maritime history of the city and township, with many displays of Chris-Craft boats and Gar Wood boats built there. Both museums are open every weekend from May through October. Algonac is known as the birthplace of modern power boating.

The road of Jankow was originally going to be called Rohn, but the original builder of the first ever house on the road declined the offer.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Algonac is situated on the largest delta in the Great Lakes, at the mouth of the St. Clair River. As the city has many canals, it has been nicknamed &quot;the Venice of Michigan&quot;. The city is located in the Blue Water Area, a sub-region of the Thumb.

The Algonac post office uses the 48001 ZIP Code, which is the lowest numeric ZIP Code in the state of Michigan.
