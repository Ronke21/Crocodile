<text>Holton Township is a civil township of Muskegon County in the U.S. state of Michigan. As of the 2020 census, the township population was 2,586.

== History ==
On November 14, 2023, Holton Township declared itself a Second Amendment Sanctuary in the State of Michigan. Concurrently, the township established the Holton Township militia.

==Geography==
The township is in northern Muskegon County, bordered to the north by Oceana County and to the east by Newaygo County. It is northeast of Muskegon, the county seat, and east of Whitehall. State highway M-120 crosses the township, leading southwest to Muskegon and northeast to Fremont.

The southern part of the township is drained by Cedar Creek, a southwest-flowing tributary of the Muskegon River, while the northern part is drained by Skeel Creek, a northwest-flowing tributary within the White River watershed.

===Communities===
*Holton is a small unincorporated community at the corners of sections 22, 23, 26 and 27 of the township at about by road northeast of Muskegon and about east of Lake Michigan. Holton was platted in 1871 and named for Henry H. Holt, a Muskegon County delegate to the State Constitutional Convention of 1867 and later Lieutenant Governor of Michigan, 1873–76. He donated the bell to the local Methodist church. A post office was established in February 1872. The Holton ZIP code, 49425, serves most of the township, as well as portions of surrounding townships.
*Brunswick is a small unincorporated community in section 13 of the township at on M-120 at the eastern boundary with section 18 of Sheridan Township in Newaygo County. It was founded about 1875 as the point where the stage coach road met the Pere Marquette Railway line between Muskegon and White Cloud. Passengers and mail were taken north from here to Hesperia. The settlement was first called &quot;County Line&quot; and later &quot;Marionville&quot;, after the first postmaster, Isaac Marion. However, the post office, established May 1881, was called &quot;Dash.&quot; It was renamed Brunswick, Muskegon County, in September 1897 and transferred to Newaygo County in April 1943. Originally there was a feed store in the community for farmers, and in the rear of that building there was a small post office. Both have since closed, and it is now served by the post office in neighboring Holton. St. Michaels Catholic Church and cemetery are located there. The community is located at the end of Brunswick Road. While the CSX rail line still runs through the town, the train station has closed.

== Education ==
In 2000, Holton was one of only seven school districts in the state of Michigan that would have been eligible for private school vouchers, on which there was a statewide referendum that year. Most residents were opposed to the measure, since they did not want competition for the local public school. The measure was defeated in Holton and across the state by about a 2:1 ratio.

The main festival of the year, Holton Days, is held in the last weekend of July.

The Holton Red Devils have a state title in volleyball in 1994. They were also runner-up in 1993. In baseball they were state runner-up in 2006, losing to #1 state ranked Homer 3–2.

<doc id="118268" wikidata="Q1831100" url="?curid=118268" title="Montague, Michigan">
<text>Montague is a city in Muskegon County, Michigan, United States. The population was 2,417 at the 2020 census. The city is politically independent from Montague Township, which borders it on three sides.

== History==
Noah Ferry founded the city, naming it in honor of his father, William Montague Ferry, who founded the cities of Grand Haven and Ferrysburg in neighboring Ottawa County. Ferry Church, built in 1874, is named in honor of Noah Henry Ferry, who died fighting for the Union at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863.

At one time, Ferry Street, also named for the founder, was the main street through town. It was named for him because the city&#x27;s post office operated on that street following its establishment in 1867, and Ferry was instrumental in getting a post office in the city. Although city hall, the city&#x27;s new post office (constructed in 2005), and a handful of businesses still operate on Ferry, Dowling Street has become the city&#x27;s main route because of its eventual connection to neighboring communities and U.S. Highway 31.

Montague is home to the &quot;World&#x27;s Largest Working Weathervane&quot;, which was constructed in part by local manufacturer Whitehall Metal Studios. The weathervane is topped by the &quot;Ella Ellenwood&quot;, a lumbering schooner that frequented White Lake transporting lumber from Montague to Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The ship became infamous after it sank in a storm in 1901, and the wooden nameplate of the schooner floated back to the shores of Montague, where it was found in 1902. Many people believed that the boat was coming home, and as a result the ship is frequently associated with the city.

==Geography==
Montague is in northwestern Muskegon County, bordered to the west, north, and northeast by Montague Township and to the southeast by the city of Whitehall. The upstream end of White Lake, a water body connected to Lake Michigan, separates the two cities. Montague is north of Muskegon, the county seat.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city of Montague has a total area of , of which are land and , or 16.4%, are water.

The Montague ZIP code 49437 serves all of Montague city, Montague Township and White River Township, as well as small portions of Whitehall Township and Blue Lake Township in Muskegon County and parts of Claybanks Township and Grant Township in Oceana County.

The city is at the southern end of the Hart-Montague Trail, a paved cycling and multiuse trail which attracts visitors during the warm months to Montague, Hart, and the small towns and businesses in between.

===Climate===
This climatic region is typified by large seasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot (and often humid) summers and cold (sometimes severely cold) winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Montague has a humid continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfb&quot; on climate maps.

==Education==
Montague Area Public Schools (MAPS) is the local school district for the city of Montague. Three of the district&#x27;s five schools are located in the city, Montague High School, Nellie B. Chisholm (NBC) Middle School and R.R. Oehrli (RRO) Elementary School. The district&#x27;s other two schools, Oceana High School and Rothbury Elementary are located in the Village of Rothbury. The district serves students of both Muskegon and Oceana counties. This arrangement exists after voters living in the district of Rothbury Public Schools agreed to merge with the district of Montague Public Schools. This merger of the two districts took place in the 1950s to increase efficiency and decrease costs for both communities, led to the formation of &quot;Montague Area Public Schools&quot;.

The district serves students living in the Muskegon County communities of the city of Montague, as well as Montague and White River townships. In addition it serves students living in parts of Whitehall and Blue Lake townships. The district also serves students living in the Oceana County communities of the Village of Rothbury and Otto Township. It also serves students living in parts of New Era. Also, the district is a member of the &quot;Muskegon County School of Choice&quot; program; the district can serve anyone living in Muskegon County. The district has increased enrollment slightly from the program, but has limited growth in the past because the rural district has limited capacity for new enrollees.

The city of Montague is also the home of Saint James Catholic School. The small parochial school serves grades K-5 and has roughly 100 students. It serves students living in the Montague Area Public School District, as well as the Whitehall District Schools. The school shares busing with both districts, and dropped the sixth grade a few years after adding kindergarten. Recently, White Lake Baptist Academy (grades K-12) and Mouth School (grades K-8) closed because of dwindling enrollment.

<text>Muskegon ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Muskegon County, Michigan, United States. Situated around a harbor of Lake Michigan, Muskegon is known for fishing, sailing regattas, and boating. It is the most populous city along Lake Michigan&#x27;s eastern shore. At the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population was 38,318. The city is administratively autonomous from adjacent Muskegon Township, and several locations in Muskegon Township and other surrounding townships have Muskegon addresses.

Muskegon is the center of the Muskegon metropolitan statistical area, which is coextensive with Muskegon County and had a population of 175,824 as of the 2020 census. It is also part of the larger Grand Rapids-Kentwood-Muskegon-combined statistical area.

== History ==
The name &quot;Muskegon&quot; is derived from the Ottawa , meaning &quot;marshy river or swamp&quot;.

The &quot;Masquigon&quot; River (Muskegon River) was identified on French maps dating from the late 17th century, suggesting French explorers had reached Michigan&#x27;s western coast by that time. Father Jacques Marquette traveled northward through the area on his fateful trip to St. Ignace in 1675, and a party of French soldiers under La Salle&#x27;s lieutenant, Henry de Tonty, passed through the area in 1679.

The county&#x27;s earliest known Euro-American resident was Edward Fitzgerald, a fur trader and trapper who came to the Muskegon area in 1748 and who died there, reportedly being buried in the vicinity of White Lake. Between 1790 and 1800, a French-Canadian trader named Joseph La Framboise established a fur-trading post at the mouth of Duck Lake. Between 1810 and 1820, several French-Canadian fur traders, including Lamar Andie, Jean Baptiste Recollect, and Pierre Constant, had established fur-trading posts around Muskegon Lake.

Euro-American settlement of Muskegon began in earnest in 1837, which coincided with the beginning of the exploitation of the area&#x27;s extensive timber resources. The explosion of the lumber industry in 1837 inaugurated what some regard as the most romantic era in the history of the region. Lumbering in the mid-19th century brought many settlers, particularly from Germany, Netherlands, and Sweden.

Some Muskegon neighborhoods began as separate villages. Bluffton was founded as a lumbering village in 1862 in Laketon Township. It had its own post office from 1868 until 1892. Muskegon annexed it in 1889.

==Geography==
Muskegon is in western Muskegon County, on the south side of Muskegon Lake, a harbor of Lake Michigan. The city is bordered to the north, across Muskegon Lake, by the city of North Muskegon and Laketon Township.

It is northwest of Grand Rapids, north of Holland, and south of Ludington.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which , or 22.3%, are covered by water. The Muskegon River empties into Muskegon Lake at the city&#x27;s northeast end.

In May 2022, local environmental groups announced cleanup efforts along Muskegon Lake officially have been completed, leading the Environmental Protection Agency to begin its study to remove Muskegon Lake from the EPA&#x27;s list of &quot;Areas of Concern&quot;, which was expected to be finalized by the end of 2022 and promised additional new economic activity in the downtown and nearby lakefront neighborhoods.

Until 1971, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway (successor to the Pere Marquette Railway) operated day and night trains from Union Station to Holland and Chicago. The Grand Trunk Western and the Pennsylvania Railroad had earlier operated passenger trains out of another Muskegon station to various points in Michigan.

<text>Norton Shores is a city in Muskegon County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 25,030 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The Ojibwe, Bodewadmi and Odawa Native Americans for hundreds of years occupied the wilds of western Michigan. When European immigrants arrived, they found openings in the forest made by the Native Americans, which were used to raise food.

Norton Township was originally organized in 1845 by settlers of the village of Mill Point (now Spring Lake). The township was named in honor of Col. Amos Norton, a Canadian patriot who was implicated in the rebellion of 1837.

Norton Township was part of Ottawa County and also included the townships of Fruitport and Sullivan. In 1855 Spring Lake Township was detached from Norton and organized as a township in Ottawa County. Also in 1855 the village of Black Lake was settled with a railroad station and a sawmill in Norton Township. Norton Township was separated from Ottawa County in 1859 and became a part of Muskegon County. The population of Norton Township in 1860 was 197 and in 1864 was 229.

In 1847 the first sawmill in Norton Township was built. It was known as Robinson&#x27;s Mill and was located at the head of Black Lake (now known as Mona Lake).

In 1850, Ira Porter arrived at Mona Lake. He operated Porter Sawmill and a fruit farm. One of the largest fruit farms in Norton Township was operated by G. N. Cobb, who also operated a box factory for fifteen years beginning in 1869. With the closing of the sawmills and the box factory, residents turned to raising fruit, which became a very profitable industry. Boats would enter Lake Harbor and make a trip around the lake picking up crates of berries at the docks of the growers. They would then return to Lake Michigan with their cargo and transfer it to large steamers bound for Chicago.

In 1894 a summer resort community called Hackley Park was established on Lake Michigan and Mona Lake. It was named for Charles Hackley. The name was shortened to &quot;Hackley&quot; when it got a post office in 1895, although the post office closed in 1897. The township was incorporated as the City of Norton Shores in 1968; the move protected it from annexation by nearby cities.

==Geography==
The city is in southwestern Muskegon County, bordered to the west by Lake Michigan and to the south by Ottawa County. The cities of Muskegon, Roosevelt Park, and Muskegon border Norton Shores to the north.

Hoffmaster State Park is in the western part of the city, occupying forested dune complexes along the Lake Michigan shoreline.

The city offers educational opportunities from the Mona Shores Public Schools to Muskegon Community College, Baker College and Grand Valley State University.

<text>Whitehall is a city in Muskegon County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 2,909 at the 2020 census. The city is located to the west of Whitehall Township. Montague is its neighbor.

==History==
It is located on White Lake (actually the mouth of the White River). Whitehall&#x27;s recorded history &quot;circa&quot; 1859 when Charles Mears, a noted lumber baron to the area, platted the village along with Giles B. Slocum, naming it &quot;Mears&quot;. The population continued to grow due to its strategic location for floating and distributing lumber.

In 1862, it was renamed &quot;Whitehall&quot; and incorporated as a village in 1867. It was incorporated as a city in 1943.

==Geography==
Whitehall is in northwestern Muskegon County, about inland from Lake Michigan. White Lake originally emptied into Lake Michigan through a natural channel (see Logging the White: The White Lake Lumber Industry: 1837-1900 by Daniel J. Yakes, Ph. D. and Steven S. Demos, M.D.[Montague, Michigan: Looking Aft Publications, 2010], p 2). It is now connected to Lake Michigan by a dredged canal. The city is bordered to the west, across White Lake, by the city of Montague. Montague Township is to the north, Whitehall Township is to the east, and Fruitland Township is to the south.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Whitehall has a total area of , of which are land and , or 15.3%, are water. The White River enters White Lake between the cities of Whitehall and Montague. The White River is nearly in length and passes through White Lake before emptying into Lake Michigan. In 1675, Jacques Marquette stopped in the area and learned that the Native Americans called the stream &quot;Wabish-Sippe&quot;, meaning &quot;the river with white clay in the water&quot;, which gave rise to the names of White River and White Lake.

==Major highways==
*, a four-lane freeway, crosses the northeast corner of the city, leading south to Muskegon and north to Ludington.
* is a business loop through the downtowns of both Whitehall and Montague.

==Culture and recreation==

===Music and fine arts===

Whitehall is home to the Playhouse at White Lake. The 400-seat theater was built in 1916 to be a performance venue for the White Lake area. In 1973 the theater was in danger of demolition and was acquired and renovated by nearby Blue Lake Fine Arts Camp with the help of a local fund drive and the participation of Whitehall&#x27;s largest employer at the time, Howmet Castings. Blue Lake had been putting out productions until they built their own on-site facility in 2006. The theater was then transferred to the city, which puts on a season of theater running through the summer. Community fund raising efforts to improve the playhouse and keep it running are ongoing.

The Arts Council of White Lake has a 30-year history of providing high quality artistic support to the White Lake Community. They provide numerous opportunities for members of the community and surrounding areas to view, listen to, create, and learn from the arts. ACWL programs, scholarships and grants reach thousands of people each year, and help build a spirited, giving, and global White Lake culture. ACWL also sponsors a local Summer Concert Series and Artisan Market the first Saturday of every month that the Farmer&#x27;s Market is open.

Whitehall is also home to three Frank Lloyd Wright cottages and a house, built from 1897 to 1905.

The White River Lighthouse was built in 1875 by Captain William Robinson and served the White Lake area until 1960, when it was deactivated by the U.S. Coast Guard. The brick lighthouse is now a museum and features exhibits about the area&#x27;s history related to the shipping and logging industries. On May 17, 1953, Mrs. Frances Johnson, the then-keeper of the lighthouse, was a contestant on the long-running TV panel show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;.

In July 2023, the idea of a public inspirational graffiti art wall was approved by the city council. It was locatedon the White Lake Pathway bike trail under the Colby Street overpass in downtown Whitehall.

Less than a year later, on March 12, 2024, the city council announced that the art wall would no longer be open for artistic expression and would be painted over later that day.

<text>Channel Islands Beach is an unincorporated community in Ventura County, California, United States consisting of three historic neighborhoods: Hollywood Beach, Hollywood by the Sea, and [[Silver Strand Beach]]. This densely populated narrow along the coastal edge of the Oxnard Plain was subdivided using the glamor of Hollywood to sell lots in the mid-1920s since the sand dunes had been used for movies. Adjacent development has left this sandy beachfront neighborhood hemmed in by Channel Islands Harbor and Naval Base Ventura County. The harbor mouth separates them into two communities resulting in a round-about travel route around the harbor between them although the &quot;Channel Islands Beach Community Services District&quot; provides local utilities services to the entire neighborhood. The Special-purpose district has an elected Board of Directors which provides a forum for the unique concerns of the community. Lying immediately adjacent but outside the corporate boundaries of the City of Oxnard and the City of Port Hueneme, they are governed by the county Board of Supervisors.

The population of this residential community was 3,103 at the 2010 census, down from 3,142 at the 2000 census. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Channel Islands Beach as a census-designated place (CDP).

==Geography ==
The census definition of the area may not correspond to local understanding of the area. This unincorporated coastal community overlooks the Santa Barbara Channel. &#x27;olołkoy Beach Park is immediately upcoast of Hollywood Beach and separates the community from the Oxnard neighborhood of Oxnard Shores. Three subdivision maps created the town lots (from north to south and the year recorded): Hollywood Beach (1924), Hollywood by the Sea (1926), and Silver Strand (1925). The mouth of the harbor was constructed over the shoreline portion of the Hollywood-by-the-Sea subdivision. A few of the lots remained on the north side of the harbor mouth with the intact Hollywood Beach subdivision. Although still unincorporated, this neighborhood is adjacent to the harbor and additional housing, both of which are in the City of Oxnard. The portion of the community on the south side of the mouth is more isolated with only one road providing access to the community. A small portion of the Hollywood-by-the-Sea subdivision touches the shore with a much large portion remaining a distinct tract of homes. The Silver Strand Beach subdivision is along most of the shoreline south of the harbor entrance which is near but without access to the Port of Hueneme.

The area is within the Hueneme School District.

<text>Fremont is a city in Newaygo County, Michigan, United States. The population was 4,516 at the time of the 2020 census.

== History ==
The first inhabitants of the Fremont area were Native Americans. A group of settlers led by Daniel Weaver first settled the area in 1855, with the Weaver homestead serving as the first post office and public school. In November 1855, Fremont Township was established and named in honor of John C. Frémont, western explorer and Republican Party candidate for United States President. Weaver and his fellow settlers cleared the dense timber in order to farm. Early in the 1870s, Dutch immigrant families came from Holland and Muskegon, Michigan; and Fremont continues to recognize its early Dutch heritage in local festivals and pageants.

Due to rich stands of virgin timber, lumbering became a major industry, and a railroad spur soon linked Fremont to the national rail network. The lumbering industry declined in the 1860s because of the American Civil War; and in 1871, Fremont experienced a major forest fire that caused extensive damage, especially to the lumber mills. Nevertheless, Fremont rebuilt and was even able to supply some lumber to rebuild Chicago after the Great Fire of 1871.

<text>Merrill Township is a civil township of Newaygo County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 741 at the 2020 census.

==Communities==
Brohman is a small unincorporated community in the eastern part of the township, between sections 13 and 24 at , on M-37, about eight miles north of White Cloud and about 15 miles west of Big Rapids. It was established in 1882 under the name of Otia, after Otia Dingman who operated a hotel here. It was also for a time known as Dingman. The ZIP code for the community (which also serves the surrounding area) is 49312.

Woodland Park (also known as &quot;Woodland Park Resort&quot;) is an unincorporated community in the northern part of the township, situated mostly between sections three and four on the north side of Woodland Lake (also known as Brookings or Crooked Lake), although settlement extends around the south side of the lake into sections nine and ten. It is at , about two miles south of Bitely and about two and a half miles northwest of Brohman. The Bitely ZIP code 49309 also includes the Woodland Park area. The community is approximately four square miles and contains a few hundred small parcels; however many of them are undeveloped.

African-American realtors Marion E. Arthur of Cleveland, Ohio, and Alvin E. Wright of Chicago, Illinois, platted the community as an all black resort town in 1923. Woodland Park began when the Brookings Lumber Company sold the remnants of its old lumbering village in Newaygo County. The site, 15 miles south of Idlewild and 37 miles north of Grand Rapids, was first put up for sale in 1920. Marion and his wife Ella Auther used earnings from commissions on the lots they sold at Idlewild to make a down payment on the village&#x27;s 200 acre lake. By 1921, the Authers purchased most of the Brooking Lumber Company&#x27;s parcels but still lacked enough money to finalize the deal. Wilbur Lemon, a white businessman from Chicago, Illinois and one of the founders of the Idlewild Resort Company, aided them by purchasing the last remaining Brookings parcel. This allowed the Authers to launch their new resort and rename it Woodland Park. The area experienced a relative decline after the Civil Rights Act of 1964 opened previously all-white resort facilities to African-Americans. The area last had its passenger rail access to Grand Rapids and other mid-western cities in 1966 when the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway terminated service through nearby Bitely and other towns on the route from Traverse City to Grand Rapids.

<text>Auburn Hills is a city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. A northern suburb of Detroit, Auburn Hills is located about north of downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 24,360.

Auburn Hills is home to Oakland University and the U.S. headquarters of Stellantis, PHINIA, BorgWarner and Volkswagen. Before incorporating as a city in 1983, the area was part of the now-defunct Pontiac Township.

==History ==
Auburn Hills began as Pontiac Township, including the village of Auburn, in 1821, at what is today the corner of Auburn and Squirrel roads. Situated on the Clinton River, it was named by Aaron Webster, the first settler, for Auburn, New York. His sawmill and grist mill attracted settlers to Auburn. After the streets were laid out in 1826, Auburn rivaled nearby Pontiac until the 1860s, when it lost its own prosperity. The town was renamed Amy in 1880, and it officially became Auburn Heights in 1919. Pontiac Township bordered the city of Pontiac on two sides. 

In 1908, automobile pioneer John Dodge bought a farmhouse northeast of Auburn Heights to use as his country retreat. He and his wife, Matilda Dodge Wilson, continued to buy farmland, eventually totaling 1,400 acres. Dodge died in 1920, and Matilda Dodge later married lumber baron Alfred Gaston Wilson, with whom she built one of America&#x27;s castles, Meadow Brook Hall, on a portion of the estate in present day Rochester Hills at a cost of $4 million (). In 1957, Matilda Dodge Wilson donated her land to Michigan State University, leading to the creation of Oakland University.

John Dodge&#x27;s oldest child, Winifred Dodge, married real estate baron Wesson Seyburn, who built his own country retreat north of Auburn Heights. The estate included hunting land, dog kennels, a swimming pool, horse stables, and a Colonial Revival house. Pontiac Township purchased the estate in 1975, and adapted the buildings for government use. Today, it is known as the Auburn Hills Civic Center. 

The first use of the name &quot;Auburn Hills,&quot; in 1964, was by Oakland Community College. They named their campus (a former Nike missile base) at Featherstone and Squirrel roads for the town and the hilly terrain in the area. Besides Oakland Community College, Oakland University&#x27;s campus is partially within the city limits.

=== Incorporation history ===
The township attempted to incorporate as Pontiac Heights in 1971, but was denied by state officials. Pontiac Township became a charter township in 1978, to protect itself from further annexation. In 1983, Pontiac Township merged with the village of Auburn Heights to become the City of Auburn Hills. It is not to be confused with the similarly named city of Auburn, Michigan, that exists in Bay County, near Saginaw Bay.

<doc id="118319" wikidata="Q820931" url="?curid=118319" title="Berkley, Michigan">
<text>Berkley is a city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. A northern suburb of Detroit on the Woodward Corridor, Berkley is located roughly northwest of downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 15,194.

==History==

Prior to settlement, the land which would become Berkley consisted largely of dense forests and some isolated pockets of swampland. Many in the region deemed the areas north and west of Detroit as uninhabitable or impassible due to the harshness of the swamps beyond Detroit, but as adventurers pushed out through the interminable swamp, they found beautiful scenery beyond the wet prairie of Northern Wayne County. As it became well known that there was &quot;fine farming country&quot; to the north and west of Detroit, great excitement was raised and people began to flock to what was then all known as Royal Oak. Land in what would later become Berkley began being sold to farmers who cut down forests and otherwise prepared the land for farming. By the 1840s, Berkley contained a great number of dairy farms. The 1910s brought significant growth to the area with the completion of the Highland Park Ford Plant. As farms were sold and turned into subdivisions, there was pressure to formally incorporate the land. In 1923, Berkley was incorporated as a village. At the time, Elmer Cromie had named the road that ran through his farm Berkley and the &quot;Berkley School&quot; was then under construction, so the name Berkley was chosen for the village.

The Wall Street Crash of 1929 brought growth in Berkley to a halt. Roughly 90% of the 5,558 residents in Berkley lost their jobs when the market crashed. Within a year, the city&#x27;s population was dropping and in 1932 voters chose to incorporate their Village into a City to gain more oversight over taxes and other issues facing the community. In the 1940s, suburbanization and the post-war boom economy drove significant development in the area. The current Berkley High School was built in 1949. The city reached a population peak of 23,375 in 1960. In 1993, the Berkley Theater, long a symbol of moviegoers in the area, closed down and became a Rite Aid drug store.

===Berkley Center===
In July 1964, an enclosed shopping mall was planned to be built, stretching east to west from Coolidge Highway to Kipling Avenue, and 12 Mile Rd to Wiltshire Rd, North to South. The plan would involve buying and demolishing 114 homes and businesses. The plan eventually collapsed.

==Culture==

Downtown Berkley stretches along 12 Mile Road between Greenfield Road and Coolidge Highway, and along Coolidge Highway between 12 Mile Road and 11 Mile Road. Downtown Berkley is home to many restaurants, boutiques, clothing stores, and retail shops. Berkley&#x27;s municipal offices, public library, and public safety headquarters are located near the intersection of 12 Mile Road and Coolidge Highway. Downtown Berkley hosts an annual Art Bash, which drew roughly 10,000 people to the city&#x27;s commercial sector in 2016. The Art Bash brings local artists from all over Michigan to sell art from photographs, garden art, jewelry and pottery to clothing accessories and paintings. Local stores and shops also participate in the festivities holding sidewalk sales. The city is an active participant in the annual Woodward Dream Cruise, a popular classic car showcase in the Metro Detroit area. Berkley hosts a classic car parade Downtown, called the Berkley CruiseFest. It holds the festivities one day before the official date of the Dream Cruise, and has done so every year since 1995.

In addition to the Downtown festivities, the city holds an annual Summerfest and Winterfest through the city Parks and Recreation department and partnerships with volunteers and community organizations. The City of Berkley is home to many neighborhood parks and a large central community center, which is located on Catalpa Drive, just east of Anderson Middle School. For decades, Berkley Parks and Recreation operated an ice arena at their central facility, but this was closed in 2016 due to a coolant leak in the facility. In 2019, the Berkley Ice Arena was demolished.

The city of Berkley was planned and exists as an inner-ring suburb of Detroit. The majority of its streets connect on a grid pattern and typical lots are small by suburban standards. This is viewed by the residents as fostering a tight-knit community. This has led to the community becoming an increasingly popular suburb, being among the healthiest housing markets in Michigan and the United States, but despite this Berkley is still considered affordable by &quot;Money.com&quot;, which rated Berkley as the 28th-best place to live for the money, in the United States due to its &quot;small-town feel&quot; within Metro Detroit and its &quot;easily walkable downtown&quot;.

The school district includes four elementary schools (Angell, Burton, Pattengill, and Rogers), one Kindergarten-8th grade school (Norup International), one middle school (Anderson), and one high school (Berkley High School). From 2008 to 2016, Berkley High School has been named by Newsweek on its list of 1,000 Best High Schools in the nation. In 2008, it ranked among the top six in Michigan, and in 2017 &quot;The Washington Post&quot; rated it as one of the most challenging high schools in the nation, making it one of three Oakland County high schools to earn the distinction. Norup became an International Baccalaureate Candidate school in 2006 implementing the Primary Years Programme (PYP) and Middle Years Programme (MYP) for all students. Homeowners in the first block west of Woodward and in the first five streets north of Eleven Mile Road are serviced by the Royal Oak Public Schools.

A former elementary school, Avery, was converted into the Berkley School District&#x27;s Building Blocks program for infants through pre-school. The program is nationally accredited, one of among only 8% accredited centers in the country. Building Blocks was also previously housed at Tyndall Center, the building now serves as the district board office.

In 2018, Berkley city council rejected a proposal to convert the building into apartments. This decision was later reversed, and the building reopened as The Ivy in 2023.

Seeking to retain their individual characters and guard against annexation, the settlements in the northern end raced to incorporate as villages. Bingham Farms was incorporated on October 4, 1955, named after a prominent family present in the village since 1880.

<text>Birmingham is a city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is a northern suburb of Detroit located along the Woodward Corridor (M-1). As of the 2010 census, the population was 20,103.

==History==
The area comprising what is now the city of Birmingham was part of land ceded by Native American tribes to the United States government by the 1807 Treaty of Detroit. However, settlement was delayed, first by the War of 1812. Afterward the Surveyor-General of the United States, Edward Tiffin, made an unfavorable report regarding the placement of Military Bounty Lands for veterans of the War of 1812. Tiffin&#x27;s report claimed that, because of marsh, in this area &quot;There would not be an acre out of a hundred, if there would be one out of a thousand that would, in any case, admit cultivation.&quot; In 1818, Territorial Governor Lewis Cass led a group of men along the Indian Trail. The governor&#x27;s party discovered that the swamp was not as extensive as Tiffin had supposed. Not long after Cass issued a more encouraging report about the land, interest quickened as to its suitability for settlement.

The earliest land entry was made on January 28, 1819, by Colonel Benjamin Kendrick Pierce (brother of future U.S. President Franklin Pierce) for the northwest quarter of section 36. Colonel Pierce visited his land several times, but never settled on it. In March 1818, John W. Hunter and his brother Daniel left Auburn, New York, by sleigh and traveled to Michigan by way of Upper Canada. They waited in Detroit for their father and other family members, who arrived by schooner via Lake Erie in July. The family remained in Detroit until spring 1819, when Hunter made an entry for the northeast quarter of section 36, now in the southeast section of current-day Birmingham. Lacking a proper land survey, Hunter mistakenly built his log house on a tract later purchased by Elijah Willits. That house was later occupied by William Hall, a son-in-law of Elisha Hunter, while John W. Hunter built another log house a short distance to the southeast. On September 25, 1821, Elijah Willits made a land entry for the southwest quarter of section 25. Two days later, Major John Hamilton made an entry for the southeast quarter of section 25. Each of these initial land entries met at what is now the intersection of Maple Road and Pierce Street.

For a time, all three men, John W. Hunter, Hamilton, and Willits, operated hotels and taverns from their houses within a short distance from each other. While Hunter did not continue for very long, Hamilton and Willits continued a rivalry for many years, competing with each other for business from travelers on Woodward Avenue between Detroit and Pontiac. The growing settlement was known variously as &quot;Hamilton&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Hunter&#x27;s&quot;, or &quot;Willits&#x27;&quot;; it was later known as &quot;Piety Hill&quot;.

The settlement&#x27;s original plat was surveyed and recorded on August 25, 1836, in the northwest quarter of section 36, then owned by Rosewell T. Merrill, who also ran the town foundry and the thrashing machine factory. Merrill named his plat &quot;Birmingham&quot; after Birmingham, England; he envisioned that it would also become a great industrial center. Elijah Willits recorded a plat on his property on December 20, 1837. John W. Hunter followed suit with two plats on his property on January 31, 1840, and June 21, 1842, while Major Hamilton laid out a plat on October 7, 1846. Several other properties were subsequently platted as additions. The plats made in 1836 and 1837 were in anticipation of completion of the Detroit and Pontiac Railroad.

Now known as &#x27;Birmingham&#x27;, the village first received mail through the &quot;Bloomfield&quot; post office. Birmingham established its own post office on April 5, 1838. The settlement incorporated as a village in 1864, comprising the northern half of section 36 and the southern half of section 25, with a total land area of one square mile. The first village elections were held March 1, 1864. It was soon governed by a seven-man board of trustees, who appointed a marshal and a treasurer. Birmingham re-incorporated as a city in 1933. Prior to this, the area just north of 14 Mile along Woodward was known as &quot;Eco City&quot;.

The names of the city&#x27;s founders appear throughout Birmingham in civic institutions and commercial businesses: Pierce Elementary School, Hunter House Hamburgers (which was located on the road formerly known as Hunter Boulevard, which bypassed downtown to the east and was renamed Woodward, with the original Woodward Avenue section renamed Old Woodward), Hamilton Hotel, Willits Building, and Merrill Street. Hall &amp; Hunter Realtors (Established in 1954, now doing business as The Agency Birmingham) adopted their name in honor of the builder and occupier of Birmingham&#x27;s first home.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Birmingham is bordered by Bloomfield Hills on the northwest, Royal Oak on the southeast, Bloomfield Charter Township on the west and north, Southfield Township on the south, and Troy on the northeast.

==Arts and culture==

Settlers founded the First United Methodist Church in 1821 and conducted services in Elijah Willets&#x27; tavern. Its current structure was built in 1839; it is now the oldest church building in the city. Other houses of worship represent many religions.

George H. Mitchell and Almeron Whitehead were two of a small group of bachelors who had formed a club called The Eccentrics; they published a newspaper of the same name, issuing the first edition on May 2, 1878. At a price of 2 cents, &quot;The Eccentric&quot; provided a &quot;live home paper, replete with all the news of the day&quot;, with considerable emphasis on the &quot;local items of importance occurring in Birmingham and immediate vicinity&quot;. By the turn of the 20th century, &quot;The Eccentric&quot; ran advertisements for Detroit stores and theaters, as well as offers of property and houses suitable for the &quot;commuter&quot;. In the 1920s, the slogan of &quot;The Eccentric&quot; was &quot;For a Bigger and Better Birmingham&quot;. Today, the &quot;Birmingham Eccentric&quot; newspaper continues its role as reporter of the community&#x27;s local news.

In 1923, a group of friends formed The Village Players of Birmingham, a private theatre club. Originally, performances were given in the community house. In 1928 the group commissioned their own theater just outside the downtown area. Today this all-volunteer group is open to everyone and puts on five shows each year.

Birmingham&#x27;s Community House, opened in 1923, is located in downtown Birmingham. It is a non-sectarian, non-partisan venue used for meetings, banquets, weddings and other celebrations.

In 2008, the Birmingham Little League won the nine- to ten-year-old Little League state championship. The team beat Western Little League 12–5 to earn the title.

===Parks and recreation===
The city has more than twenty parks, with many amenities, including tennis and pickleball courts, baseball diamonds, playgrounds, golf courses, sledding hills, nature trails, picnic areas, and deep woods. Shain Park, the city&#x27;s main commons, is the site of the Village Fair, art shows, summer music concerts and numerous community events. At the center stands &quot;Freedom of the Human Spirit&quot; sculpted by Marshall Fredericks.

===Education===
The Birmingham City School District administers several nationally accredited schools, including Seaholm High School and Groves High School. Roeper School has a campus on Adams Road.

The Holy Name School is a co-educational parochial school founded by the Roman Catholic Holy Name Church. It educates children grades pre-K to 8. The private school was established in 1928, along with a convent for IHM nuns. (That has since closed.) The church and school continue to operate in conjunction today. 

Pierce Elementary School in Birmingham provides classes for elementary school students of the French School of Detroit.

The Japanese School of Detroit (JSD), a supplementary school for Japanese citizens, first began holding classes in Birmingham in 1987, when its operation at Seaholm High started. It began holding classes at Covington School in 1989, and it also had classes at West Maple Elementary. At one point its school offices were in Birmingham. In 2010 the school announced it was moving its operations to Novi.

===Public library===

The Baldwin Public Library serves the city of Birmingham and nearby communities of Beverly Hills, Bingham Farms, and Bloomfield Hills. The original building first opened to the public on December 19, 1927. In October 1959, an extension for the Youth Department was added to the east side of the building. In 1983, another addition opened, changing the entrance to Merrill Street. There are over 120,000 books in the library, along with CDs, DVDs, periodicals, educational toys, databases and free Wi-Fi.

The library is named after Martha Baldwin, a civic leader and lifelong resident of Birmingham who was instrumental in establishing the first library. She also helped get improvements such as sidewalks laid for the business section, street lights, seats placed at interurban transit stops, flowers and trees planted, and trash baskets placed at the street corners.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

Birmingham was a stagecoach stop in the 19th century between Detroit and Pontiac. 
In 1839, the railroad tracks were extended to Birmingham with two steam trains a day running to Detroit.

On June 18, 1896, the Oakland Railway, the electric interurban, was constructed to Birmingham; it provided service to Detroit in 40 minutes. This service ended in 1931 as many passengers switched to the commuter rail and automobiles.

Amtrak provides long-distance passenger rail service on the Pontiac–Detroit–Chicago Wolverine. It stops in Birmingham three times per day in each direction at the Birmingham, Michigan Amtrak station. Class one freight rail service is provided by Canadian National Railway (CN).

By 1931, the Grand Trunk Western Railroad (GTW) moved the railroad tracks to their present location. It provided commuter rail service from Pontiac to downtown Detroit with a stop in Birmingham. The Southeastern Michigan Transportation Authority (SEMTA) took control of this service in 1974 but it was ended on October 17, 1983, after subsidies were discontinued. Efforts continue to this day to restore such service.

In the 21st century, the Suburban Mobility Authority for Regional Transportation (SMART) and the Regional Transit Authority (RTA) operate local and regional bus transit.

<text>Bloomfield Hills is a city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. A northern suburb of Detroit on the Woodward Corridor, Bloomfield Hills is located roughly northwest of downtown Detroit, and is surrounded on most sides by Bloomfield Township. As of the 2020 United States Census, the city had a population of 4,460.

==History==

On June 28, 1820, Oakland County was divided into two townships: Pontiac Township and Bloomfield Township, the latter covering the southern part of the county that would include West Bloomfield Township, Royal Oak and Southfield. What is now Bloomfield Hills was a farming area until the turn of the 20th century when wealthy Detroit residents bought up the land. The settlement became a village in 1927, and in 1932 residents voted to become a city to avoid being incorporated into growing Birmingham.

==Culture==

Bloomfield Hills is the location of the National Historic Landmark Cranbrook Educational Community and other historic sites listed on the national register of historic places.

In popular culture, Bloomfield Hills was the setting for the 2005 film &quot;The Upside of Anger&quot;. In the 2002 film &quot;8 Mile&quot;, Eminem mentions Cranbrook Kingswood while making fun of &quot;Doc&quot; because he attended Cranbrook, which is not considered cool or impressive in the atmosphere portrayed in the film. Bloomfield Hills is the hometown of the comic book character, Trance. Some scenes in &quot;Out of Sight&quot; with Jennifer Lopez and George Clooney were filmed at a private residence in Bloomfield Hills. (In the novel by Elmore Leonard on which the film is based, the most prominent street in Bloomfield Hills is described as &quot;Vaughan Road, nothing but money.&quot;) Jimmy Hoffa was last seen at the former Machus Red Fox restaurant in adjacent Bloomfield Township. The novel &quot;Gilda Joyce: The Ladies of the Lake&quot; is set in a private school in Bloomfield.

===Churches===

The area is the home of landmark churches including Kirk in the Hills Presbyterian on Long Lake Rd (Bloomfield Township) and Christ Church Cranbrook Episcopal, consecrated in 1928 as part of George Booth&#x27;s plan for the Cranbrook Educational Community. The Congregational Church of Birmingham United Church of Christ was founded in Birmingham but moved to its present location in at 1000 Cranbrook Road (at Woodward Avenue) in Bloomfield Hills in 1966. St. Hugo of the Hills Roman Catholic Church was funded by Theodore F. MacManus (1872–1940) and his wife in memory of their deceased children, Hugo and Hubert. St. Hugo of the Hills Catholic Church was built from 1931 to 1936, with approval from Bishop Michael J. Gallagher, and was designed by Arthur DesRossiers.

<text>Farmington is a city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. A northwestern suburb of Detroit, Farmington is located roughly from downtown Detroit, and is surrounded on most sides by the larger city of Farmington Hills. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 11,594.

The area is known for its historic downtown, elegant Victorian-style homes, and one of Michigan&#x27;s top rated public school systems, Farmington Public Schools.

==History==
Farmington was the site of three Native American trails - the Orchard Lake Trail, the Grand River Trail, and the Shiawassee Trail.

Farmington was founded in 1824 by Arthur Power. Like many Oakland County pioneers, he hailed from the state of New York. Power was a Quaker, as were the settlers who joined him, and the town was first known as Quakertown. In 1826 the name Farmington was officially chosen because it was the name of Power&#x27;s hometown, Farmington, New York.

The name Farmington, which properly refers to the municipality incorporated in the early 19th century, is sometimes erroneously used to refer to the neighboring city of Farmington Hills (Farmington Township until 1973), which surrounds it.

In 1976 the National Register of Historic Places declared part of the city the Farmington Historic District.

Since 2009, the city&#x27;s downtown has been the center of an extensive renovation and remodeling featuring a refacing or rebuilding of many buildings on Grand River Avenue, as well as brick paver sidewalks, the Farmington Pavilion, new lighting, and landscaping. In 2007 CNNMoney.com listed Farmington as number 55 in its Best Places to Live survey. Farmington was also ranked 27th on the list for Best to Live in 2013, citing nearly US$3 million in additional city renovations and development, bumping its rank up.

<text>Farmington Hills is a city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. A northwestern suburb of Detroit, Farmington Hills is located roughly from downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population was 83,986, making it the second-largest community in Oakland County.

Farmington Hills consistently ranks as one of the safest cities in the United States, as well as in the state of Michigan. The area ranked as the 30th safest city in the U.S. in 2010 and as the 2nd safest city in Michigan in 2020. Farmington Hills also ranks as the 36th highest-income place in the United States with a population of 50,000 or more and ranked as 14th America&#x27;s best cities to live by 24/7 Wall St. in 2016.

Although the two cities have separate services and addresses, Farmington and Farmington Hills are often thought of as the same community. These two cities combined were part of Farmington Township in the time of the Northwest Territory. Features of the community include a recently renovated downtown, boutiques, a vintage cinema, numerous restaurants, exotic car dealerships, art galleries, and public parks including Heritage Park. There are several historical sites including the Longacre House and the Governor Warner Mansion. Both cities are served by Farmington Public Schools and the Farmington Community Library.

Farmington Hills is the home of the Holocaust Memorial Center, the only Holocaust memorial in the State of Michigan. The center&#x27;s mission is to educate the public about the tragedy and evils of the Holocaust. The Holocaust Memorial Center was originally located in neighboring West Bloomfield Township, but has since expanded and moved to its current facility.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Farmington Hills is bordered by West Bloomfield to the north, Franklin and Southfield to the east, Livonia to the south, and Novi to the west.

==History==
The first white settler in what became Farmington Township was a Quaker from Farmington, New York, named Arthur Power. He purchased land in 1823 and returned in 1824 with a group of families and associates to clear the land. The settlement became known as Quakertown. A post office was established in February 1826 with the name of Farmington. The original post office is still standing today, and is a designated historical site. The township of Farmington was organized in 1827, and the settlement was incorporated as the village of Farmington in the winter of 1866–67. A fire on October 9, 1872, destroyed many buildings in the village center. Farmington was incorporated as a city in 1926.

A small settlement was also developed in Clarenceville, in the extreme southeast corner of the township on the boundary with Livonia in Wayne County. Stephen Jennings built a tavern and a general store to accommodate travelers on the plank road between Detroit and Howell. The name remains in the Clarenceville School District. Even though the school buildings for Clarenceville are in Livonia in Wayne County, the school district serves a portion of Farmington Hills.

In 1839, a post office named East Farmington was opened, but it closed in 1842.

In 1847, a post office named North Farmington was established a mile south of the township line as Wolcott&#x27;s Corners. After the death of postmaster Chauncey D. Walcott in 1865, the office moved to the township line in the northeast quarter of section 4 (near the intersection of 14 Mile Road and Farmington Road). The post office functioned until September 1902.

Before the remainder of Farmington Township was incorporated as the city of Farmington Hills, there were two other incorporated entities within its boundaries. The first began as a subdivision named Quaker Valley Farms that was incorporated as the village of Quakertown in 1959. The other was Wood Creek Farms, developed in 1937 as a subdivision by George Wellington of Franklin, who named it after a New England estate. It was incorporated as a village in 1957. The villages, together with the remainder of Farmington Township, were incorporated into the City of Farmington Hills in 1973. The City grew rapidly throughout the mid-20th century.

==Economy==
Farmington Hills is home to the headquarters of numerous major companies, including Gale, Mango Languages, 5-Hour Energy, and The Sharper Image, as well as the United States headquarters of Bosch, Mercedes-Benz Financial Services, and TD Auto Finance. The city was also previously home to the headquarters of Compuware, White Motor Company, A&amp;W Restaurants, and Michigan National Bank.

Nissan&#x27;s North American technical center is located in Farmington Hills. The Nissan technical center handled project engineering of vehicle bodies used in North America and Latin America. It also has a small laboratory, where as of 2012, research is being conducted with hydrogen fuel cells. The company planned to add electrical battery and recharging of electrical vehicle research to the laboratory. As of January 2012 the technical center had 800 full-time employees. At that time Nissan planned to hire 150 more engineers to work in the technical center. The technical center opened in November 1991 at a cost of $80 million. In 2005, Nissan added a $14 million design studio at their Farmington Hills campus, and the Nissan AZEAL was the first car to be designed there.

=== Proposed merger with Farmington ===
In 2006, a public meeting was held in Farmington Hills to discuss the possible merger of the two cities as a money saving venture, and also as a way to keep the two communities vibrant.

<text>Franklin is a village in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. A northern suburb of Detroit, Franklin is located within Southfield Township, roughly northwest of downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the village had a population of 3,139.

The community is known for large, estate-style homes. The downtown was designated as a historic district, the first in Michigan, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969. The Franklin Cider Mill is a visitor attraction.

==History==
The community was founded in 1825 by Elijah Bullock and other European-American settlers; it was named after Benjamin Franklin, a Founding Father of the United States, in 1831. By 1830, a business district formed. The village has a unique collection of historical structures in original condition that is unusual for suburban Detroit. The village was incorporated in 1953.

===Historical markers===
In 1960 a historical marker was erected that reads: 
FRANKLIN VILLAGE Founded in 1824–1825, Franklin received its present name in 1828. First postmaster was Dr. Ebenezer Raynale, state legislator and physician. The William Huston store, opened in 1830, was the forerunner of a business center that later included the famous Broughton Wagon Shop, the Van Every Mills, now Ye Olde Cider Mill; several taverns, two distilleries, and two churches. The village also was a station on the Underground Railroad. Franklin still has the appearance and atmosphere of an early Michigan village.

Another marker was installed in front of Franklin Village School: 
Franklin Village School – Michigan&#x27;s Territorial Council passed a law in 1827 requiring every township with fifty or more inhabitants to establish a school. Thus the following year, the first school in Southfield Township was erected in Franklin Village. Sophie Gotie taught twenty-nine students in a log schoolhouse located near the still extant house of early settler Daniel Broughton. Franklin village built a new school in 1845 at the foot of School Hill on property deeded by Winthrop Worthings. On this site in 1869 a third school was constructed on land given by wealthy postmaster A.A. Rust. After that building burned in 1922, the village erected the present school on this same location. The Franklin School District No. 3, Southfield Township, joined the Birmingham Public Schools in 1945.

This building closed as a public school in 1979. In 1988, members of Metro Detroit&#x27;s Muslim community bought the building and adapted it as Huda School and Montessori, a K-8 Islamic parochial school. On Saturdays the building houses the related Dar-al-Huda Islamic Saturday school.

In 2006, the Muslim community raised $3.6 million (~$ in ) to fund renovation and expansion of the school. In the summer of 2007, the Monahan Construction Company renovated the school. In September 2007, the community raised another $1 million to continue the project&#x27;s second phase, which was completed in 2008. Franklin also the hometown Farmbrook Free Press, a small publication.

===Points of interest===
Franklin is known for the Franklin Cider Mill, just north of the village&#x27;s borders in neighboring Bloomfield Township. The Franklin Cider Mill was established as a gristmill in 1837, the year Michigan became a state. It was converted to a cider mill in 1949.

Franklin&#x27;s current firehouse was built in 1959. The village employs one firefighter and a chief; the rest of the force is volunteer. The station was built on the site of the former community hall, which burned down in 1958.

Because of its many original mid-19th century properties, Franklin was designated as Michigan&#x27;s first historic district on November 11, 1969, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places that year. The boundaries of the district have been expanded to include more contributing properties.

<doc id="118334" wikidata="Q583354" url="?curid=118334" title="Hazel Park, Michigan">
<text>Hazel Park is a city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. An inner-ring suburb of Detroit, Hazel Park borders Detroit to the north, roughly north of downtown Detroit. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 14,983.

Hazel Park was incorporated as a city in 1941 and bills itself as &quot;The Friendly City&quot;. From 1949 to 2018, it was the site of the Hazel Park Raceway, considered a high-quality facility originally used for both Thoroughbred and Standardbred racing. From 1985 on, the track ran only harness races. After 1996, it also provided simulcasts of races year round from across North America, with betting allowed on these races at the track facilities.

==History==
This area was long occupied by indigenous peoples, with such historic and current tribes as the Potawatomi and others known to European fur traders and colonists from the 17th century.

In the later 19th century, as westward migration increased from the eastern United States to the Great Lakes territories, this area was settled by European Americans. They first developed it for agriculture. In October 1882, a group of farmers gathered to organize the community&#x27;s first school. They built a one-room school in 1883 and later expanded it to two rooms. In 1884, John W. Benjamine petitioned the state of Michigan to form a school district from Royal Oak Township. Benjamine, who was School Inspector for Royal Oak Township, named it Hazel Park School District 8, after the abundant hazelnut bushes in the area.

In 1920, the Thomas W. Lacey School, was built on present-day Woodruff Avenue. The first Hazel Park school had been sold to Frank Neusius, who used it as a barber shop and neighborhood grocery.

Given a rapid increase in this period of the number of school-age children as population grew, the school district soon added four grade schools. It built a larger building at the central location, also called the Lacey School. This became the site for high school students. With further postwar population growth, Hazel Park High School was built. The former high school at John R and 9 Mile Roads was used as Lacey Junior High School.

Hazel Park&#x27;s growth was stimulated by the expansion of jobs at the Ford Motor Company, based in nearby Highland Park. Hospitals, offices and shops were developed in the area of 9 Mile Road. The electric Stephenson Line was a convenient way for commuters to travel by trolley to Highland Park and Detroit. In 1924, Hazel Park installed its first traffic light, was granted a post office, and established a Deputy Sheriff&#x27;s office. The city was incorporated in 1941.
During the 1930s and 1940s, rallies and community events helped the city during the Great Depression and the years of World War II. Large parts of the auto industry were converted to production of defense-related goods, and thousands of people migrated into the area for new jobs. After the city&#x27;s incorporation, it improved the infrastructure and provided running water to all areas.

In 1942, the Elias Brothers, John, Fred and Louis Elias, established a diner in Hazel Park. The Dixie Drive-In was one of the first in the Midwest to offer curbside services. In 1952, the diner was franchised as a Big Boy restaurant. Louis Elias was elected as Mayor of Hazel Park, serving two terms from 1953 to 1961. The Elias brothers continued to open Big Boy restaurants throughout the Metro Detroit area and in 1983 purchased the franchiser.

With the return of thousands of soldiers from World War II, housing demand was very high in the area. It stimulated a boom in construction. Many of the current bungalows in the city were built shortly after the war.

Hazel Park Raceway opened for thoroughbred horse racing in 1949. It was considered a state-of-the-art facility. Harness racing was added in 1953. In 1950 the Detroit Race Course opened in Livonia, Michigan, to the north of Detroit, offering competition with both flat and harness racing. In 1996 the state legislature approved onsite betting at racetracks for simulcast events, and the track was opened year round for patrons to view on racing events from across North America. In 2018 the profitable Hazel Park track was closed after being sold. The new owner wanted to use the large property to develop new warehouse space for an Amazon distribution center.

In 1966 the Interstate 75 (I-75) freeway was fully completed through Hazel Park, as part of the postwar highway construction subsidized by the federal government. It superseded Stephenson Highway, now used as a service drive. Similarly, I-696 was constructed through the neighboring city of Madison Heights in 1979; it joins the two freeways and creating a busy junction with I-75, part of which extends into Hazel Park&#x27;s north end.

==Architecture==
Hazel Park is dominated by domestic architecture of the post-World War II era. Many of the city&#x27;s houses were built in the Cape Cod bungalow style, shortly after World War Two, and have a second story encompassed in the home&#x27;s roofing.

Michigan bungalows are also common in the city. These houses were originally built during the 1920s and 1930s and can often be found near the downtown area.

Ranch houses became a popular style, and were builtin the northern neighborhoods during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Older ranch houses were often built with aluminum siding, whereas newer ones, such as the ones built in the Courts, were built in brick or stone.

Front split-level and side split-level houses are not common in the city. However, back split houses - split-levels with the second story built into the back - are common in the southern portion of the city near the 8 Mile border. This style of home is often the result of additions built onto one-story bungalows and ranch houses.

Colonial houses are more rare in the city, but are scattered throughout different neighborhoods. These houses are often built in brick and usually resemble urban Tudor houses. Some are built in stone, often more common north of 9 Mile Road. Others are built in the Traditional Tudor style.

New development homes are extremely common in the city. They can be seen on many blocks of Hazel Park, and often range from two-story snout houses to detached single-family brownstones. Many of these houses are built in the Neo-eclectic style.

===Neighborhoods===

Residential areas make up the majority of the city and are in most cases located in sub-divisions located off main roads. Hazel Park was originally laid out in a grid from 1900 to 1925. East-west streets ran from Dequindre Road to Hilton Road on the western edge of the city (now the independent city of Ferndale); and north-south streets ran from Nine Mile Road to Woodward Heights Boulevard.

While largely retained, the grid has also been modified through the decades. Dead-end streets became increasingly common in the northeast area of the city after the construction of Karam Park and Longfellow Elementary school, which cut off the streets stemming from Vassar Avenue north of Woodward Heights Boulevard. Other dead-end streets occur at the borders of the properties for Webster Elementary, Ford Elementary, and Saint Justin&#x27;s Catholic Church.
==Economy ==
The business districts developed along the city&#x27;s main thoroughfares. Hazel Park&#x27;s central business district (CBD) developed around the intersection of John R. Road and Nine Mile Road. This CBD contains the city&#x27;s municipal buildings, two shopping centers, and a high-rise apartment complex. The first Harmony House music store opened in Hazel Park&#x27;s Central Business District in 1947.

John R. Road serves as the main small business thoroughfare; the majority of the road is zoned for local business use. Small shopping centers, office parks, and sidewalk access stores are characteristic of the John R. corridor through the city. Nine Mile Road has a more suburban assortment of businesses, many of which are restaurants, churches, and slightly larger shopping centers. Eight Mile Road, Dequindre Road, and Ten Mile Road are also well-traveled, industry-related thoroughfares.

==Government==

Hazel Park has a Council-Manager form of government. It is governed by an elected City Council consisting of a mayor and four council members. The city council appoints a City Manager, who manages the day-to-day operations of the city. The current mayor of Hazel Park is Michael Webb, who succeeded Jeffrey Keeton. Jan Parisi, the city&#x27;s first woman mayor, resigned in 2016 due to health-and family-related reasons.

Current city council members are Alissa Sullivan, who also serves as Mayor Pro Tem, Andy LeCureaux, Luke Londo, and Mike McFall. The current city manager is Edward Klobucher. City government is located on the same block as the public library, police station, and post office, at 9 Mile Road and John R Road.

The Hazel Park Police Department has a force of 42 full-time police officers. The department has auxiliary policing and neighborhood watch programs available to citizens ages 21 and over. The police department offers programs such as gun lock giveaways, house watch programs, and programs to put a child up for adoption in case the parent is not capable of raising the child.

The city is served by the Hazel Park School District, which has some establishments in Ferndale, a neighboring city.
There are three elementary schools operating in the city of Hazel Park.

The northern portion of the city is served by Webb Elementary, while the southern portion is served by United Oaks Elementary and Hoover Elementary. Multiple other elementary schools once operated in the city, including Roosevelt, Lee O. Clark, Longfellow, Henry Ford, Webster, and Edison Elementaries. Webster was closed as an elementary school at the end of the 2014 school year, but remains open for the Preschool program. Lee O. Clark has since been demolished, and Henry Ford has been converted into the School District Administration Building. Henry Ford also serves as an alternative education facility for students K-8 called Advantage, and a program called Breakfast Club for high school students. 
There is one high school and one middle school operating in Hazel Park. Hazel Park has followed a recent trend in Metro Detroit suburbs by the consolidation of its middle schools. Formerly, two separate schools, Webb Junior High and Beecher Middle School, operated in the city. Webb was converted to an elementary school in 2004, and Beecher was torn down and re-built, commissioned as Hazel Park Junior High.

High schools in Hazel Park began with the construction of Lacey High School in 1920 and Hazel Park High School in 1929. Lacey High was demolished in the early 1960s, and the Hazel Park High School was re-commissioned as Howard Beecher Junior High. In 1961, a new high school was built in the eastern portion of the city, taking the name of Hazel Park High School.

Jardon Vocational School is also in operation in order to separate special needs students from the mainstream curriculum and serves as a high school. The school operates mainly in the Hazel Park-Ferndale-Pleasant Ridge area, but also serves the rest of Oakland County, especially the south east.

The high school had an average score of 10.3 on the state&#x27;s MEAP test in 2011. This was one of the lowest scores in Oakland County.

<text>Highland Township, officially the Charter Township of Highland, is a charter township of west Oakland County, Michigan. The population was 19,172 at the time of the 2020 census.

Highland Township is a western suburb of Metro Detroit and is located about west of the city of Pontiac and about northwest of the city of Detroit.

Highland Township was founded by pioneer families in 1835. A major factor in the development of Highland was the railroad, which allowed lumber to be transported cheaply, and allowed products from the township&#x27;s early factories to be exported easily. In 2003, in an effort to retain its rural character, as well as preserve its extensive equestrian heritage, Highland declared itself an &quot;equestrian community&quot; and began active support and encouragement of the equestrian presence and related development in the township. In 2006, thanks in large part to the efforts of the Highland Equestrian Conservancy, Highland Township received official recognition by the state government as Michigan&#x27;s first designated equestrian community.

<text>Independence Township is a charter township of Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. The population was 36,686 at the 2020 census.

Independence Township was first organized in 1834. The township surrounds the city of Clarkston, but the two are administered autonomously after Clarkston incorporated as a city in 1992. The township is home to the Pine Knob Music Theatre and the Pine Knob Ski Resort.

== History ==
The first settlers arrived in Independence Township in the mid-1820s and early 1830s, primarily from New Jersey and New York. The first settler to purchase and settle land in the township was John W. Beardslee (b. 1799, d. 1883), from Sussex County, New Jersey.

Independence Township was named by one of its earliest settlers, Joseph Van Sycle, who came to the area in 1834 from Independence Township, New Jersey.

While initially the township was primarily agricultural, the many lakes in the area were beginning to draw vacationers out of Detroit and other cities. In 1851, the railroad came through Clarkston, which prompted hotels to be built in the township to accommodate the resort vacationers coming to the area. 
The invention of the automobile had a tremendous effect on Independence Township. Roads that were once Native American trails were paved and widened for this new mode of transportation. The old Saginaw Trail, now known as Dixie Highway, was paved as early as 1920, and Main Street (M-15) in Clarkston was paved around 1922.

The expanding national highway system brought I-75 through Independence Township in 1962, spurring both business and residential development. Many farms gave way to subdivisions and strip malls as Independence Township continued evolving into part of Metropolitan Detroit.

<text>Keego Harbor is a city in Oakland County in the U.S. state of Michigan. A northern suburb of Detroit, Keego Harbor is located roughly from downtown Detroit, and about southwest of Pontiac. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 2,970. With a land area of , Keego Harbor is the third-smallest city by land area in the state of Michigan, after Petersburg and Clarkston.

==History==
The first non-native settlers to the area arrived between 1825 and 1830. Cass Lake drew many wealthy residents to purchase land along the lake for vacationing. In 1890, a railway line was built through Keego Harbor to connect to Detroit and Pontiac, making the area much more accessible. At the turn of the century, a prominent Pontiac lawyer, Joseph E. Sawyer, purchased and platted land just to the southwest along Orchard Lake. He built a canal to connect the smaller Dollar Lake to Cass Lake and declared the area to be a harbor on the eastern edge of Cass Lake. He named the area Keego, which was a phonetic spelling of the Anishinaabemowin word &quot;giigoonh&quot; meaning &quot;fish.&quot; The spelling Keego comes from the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem, &quot;The Song of Hiawatha&quot;. The community was originally part of West Bloomfield Township before incorporating as an independent city in 1955.

<text>Lake Orion ( ) is a village in the northern outskirts of Metro Detroit in Oakland County, Michigan, United States. The population was 2,973 at the 2010 census. &quot;Lake Orion&quot; can refer to either the village or the much larger Orion Township, of which the village is a part.

Lake Orion began as a resort town and over time has incorporated elements of a bedroom community.

==History==
Judah Church and Moses (or Samuel) Munson were among the first settlers. Munson, who arrived in 1824, built a sawmill in 1825, and planted the first orchard. Jesse Decker arrived from upstate New York with his wife, Mary, in 1825. He was energetic and became &quot;everything to everybody&quot;, so that the place soon became known as &quot;Decker&#x27;s Settlement&quot; and the town &quot;Canandaigua,&quot; after Canandaigua, New York, where the settlers originated. The settlement grew into a bustling commercial center with a sawmill, tavern, post office, general store, blacksmith shop, school and cemetery. In 1828, a power dam was built uniting several small lakes and forming the mile-wide Lake Canandaigua, just west of the village.

In 1830, Decker raised the first frame barn in the area, with local Native Americans&#x27; help. The first post office was opened in 1832, with Decker as postmaster. In 1835, the community&#x27;s name was changed from Canandaigua to Orion, and Lake Canandaigua was renamed Lake Orion. The new name was chosen by the village&#x27;s attorney, reportedly for the Orion Trees in the area. The same year, the Township of Orion was formally approved by the Michigan Territorial government. Decker became the first Supervisor of Orion, with a salary of $2 a year. By 1836, two persons were licensed to keep taverns in the town, one of whom was Decker. He was elected to the first Michigan House of Representatives in 1837 and also served as justice of the peace for the Orion area. By 1840 Decker owned of land.

In 1909 a Marine Postal Center was established, with mail delivered to over 300 cottages on the lake and islands by boat. Lake Orion was the first town in the United States to have this service.

In 1929, Amelia Earhart visited Lake Orion at the invitation of Orion resident and fellow aviator William Edmund Scripps. While visiting Scripps Mansion, she flew an experimental glider. Also in 1929, the village known as &quot;Orion&quot; was officially renamed &quot;Lake Orion.&quot;

===Railroads and trails===
The Village of Lake Orion was served by trains on the Michigan Central Railroad from 1872 to 1976, and the Detroit United Railway interurban system from 1899 to 1931. Each service had its own track and depot, although both were named &quot;Orion&quot; and in the village near the intersection of M-24 and Flint Street. Lake Orion also had a flag stop, Rudds Station, on the MCC line east of the village near Clarkston and Kern Roads. Rudds Station served Rudds Mill, a milling operation on Paint Creek that produced wheat. The MCR line ran from Detroit to Mackinaw City, and the Flint Division of the DUR line ran from Royal Oak to Flint. With the automobile&#x27;s increased popularity and the paving of M-24 in 1929, passenger service on the DUR ended in 1931, and track was scrapped during the 1940s for a World War II metal drive. Little remains of the corridor. The MCR line maintained passenger service until 1950, and freight service continued until the 1970s. The MCC track passed through New York Central and Penn Central and operated until 1976, when it was closed after acquisition by Conrail. The original MCR rails and track east of M-24 were completely removed, and the line from the village south toward Rochester, now serves as the recreational Paint Creek Trail. The line from the village north to Oxford exists now only as a narrow path, but still passes over the historic Indian Lake Road Stone Arch Bridge, a small limestone bridge constructed over Indian Lake Road in 1891.

Lake Orion was also served by trains on the Grand Trunk Western Railroad. The Polly Ann line ran from Pontiac to Caseville, passing through western Orion Township. Two flag stop stations served Lake Orion on the Polly Ann line. Eames Station was near the intersection of Joslyn and Silverbell Roads, and Cole Station was near the intersection of Joslyn and Clarkston Roads. A short section of the track was still in use as of 2014, operated by Canadian National Railway specifically to connect the General Motors Orion Assembly plant with the CN main line in Pontiac, but all track north of Orion Assembly was eliminated and removed by 1985. In 1993, a Rails to Trails federal grant was awarded and matched by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, providing more than $728,000 to purchase the right-of-way from Grand Trunk. The corridor now serves as the recreational Polly Ann Trail, connecting Lake Orion with Oxford, Addison Township, and Leonard.

===Amusement park===
 Lake Orion was an amusement destination for residents of Metro Detroit in the first half of the century. The addition of the Michigan Central Railroad track in 1872 set the stage for Lake Orion as a major summertime resort for those traveling on the line, especially between Detroit and Flint. In 1874, several prominent citizens formed the Orion Park Association to capitalize on the growing number of travelers to the area. They developed a park on the shore of the lake (now Green&#x27;s Park) near the train depot and operated a steam-powered boat for lake excursions and delivery to Park Island. Over time, the Park Island Amusement Park grew to include a penny arcade, carousel, souvenir booths, refreshment booths, lunch stands, dining rooms, dance halls, and a wooden roller coaster named &quot;The Thriller.&quot;

The swimming beach on the north side of Park Island had both a men&#x27;s and ladies&#x27; bathhouse, a waterslide, and numerous diving boards, the highest 42 feet above the water. Lake Orion was stocked annually with bass, pickerel, and pike, and fishing tournaments and contests were held seasonally. Several double-deck boats, including the &quot;City of Orion,&quot; offered lake excursions replete with bands and a dance floor on the upper deck. At night, Park Island was illuminated by strings of thousands of lights.

Once a premier destination among vacationers, the park suffered through the Great Depression and several fires, gradually losing business before closing in 1955. The park was owned by the Detroit Edison Company (via the purchase of a subsidiary, the Orion Power and Light company) from 1912 until closure. The island and park property were later purchased by a private real estate developer who built homes on the island in the 1960s. In many brochures and newspaper advertisements in the 1910s and 1920s, Lake Orion was advertised to potential travelers as the &quot;Venice of the Middle West,&quot; &quot;Paris of Detroit,&quot; and &quot;Lake Orion, the One Best Resort&quot;.

===Folklore===
The story of the Lake Orion Dragon says that sometime in the 1800s, a group of local children played a prank by building a fake dragon and launching it on the lake. A number of people saw it and soon Lake Orion was known for its dragon. There are competing stories about who made it and how it was built, but most agreed that a Levi A. Wild was responsible.

&quot;That same year [1894] the Lake Orion &#x27;dragon&#x27; made its entrance into Orion history. First seen by two ladies near the present Robert&#x27;s Rondevoo cove, the animal grew in length as the story grew in listeners. What had started out as an average-sized lake monster was claimed by some to be at least eighty feet long. Detroit and other newspapers joshingly suggested, upon hearing of the behemoth, that Orion residents should &#x27;drink more well-water in the future.&#x27;&quot; The nickname of Lake Orion High School&#x27;s sports teams (the Dragons) derives from this.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

===Lake Orion===

Lake Orion (less commonly known as &quot;Orion Lake&quot;) is a medium-sized inland lake, with area of 506 acres. It has a maximum depth of 80 feet and an average depth of 16 feet. The lake is located within the Village of Lake Orion and Orion Township. It is the eighth largest lake by area in Oakland County.

The current area of the lake was formed by a collection of smaller lakes over time, beginning with the damming of Paint Creek in the 1830s. Canals have also been dredged to maximize lake frontage.

There is a public access boat launch on the northern side of the lake. It is administered by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources.

====Islands====
There are several islands in Lake Orion, some of which feature seasonal and year-round residences. The largest islands, Bellevue and Park, are connected to the mainland by two-lane bridges and are populated year-round. Most boats can pass under the Bellevue Bridge, which has a clearance of 9.6 feet. The Park Island bridge has a lower clearance that allows only canoes, kayaks and rowboats to pass underneath. The remaining islands are reachable only by watercraft. Victoria Island is the third largest island, and is home to several seasonal and year-round homes. A smaller island, Paint Island, was home to a single residence from the 1850s to the 1950s. Little remains of the island due to erosion save for a solitary tree, and the shallow waters can be a hazard to boaters. Sweet&#x27;s Island is home to the Lake Orion Boat Club, and features a private boathouse and docks for LOBC members. Romance Island is home to a single cottage, Preston Island to two seasonal cottages, Dot Island to one seasonal cottage and Armada Island to four seasonal cottages. The residences on all islands except for Bellevue and Park require the use of watercraft to travel to and from the mainland.

<doc id="118345" wikidata="Q3429342" url="?curid=118345" title="Fuzzy Haskins">
<text>Clarence Eugene &quot;Fuzzy&quot; Haskins (June 8, 1941 – March 16, 2023) was an American singer. He performed with 1950s and 1960s doo-wop group, The Parliaments, and was a founding member of the groundbreaking and influential 1970s funk bands Parliament and Funkadelic, also known as Parliament-Funkadelic. He left Parliament-Funkadelic in 1977 to pursue a solo career. He is a member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, inducted in 1997 with fifteen other members of Parliament-Funkadelic. In 2019, he and Parliament-Funkadelic were given Grammy Lifetime Achievement Awards.

==Early life==
Haskins was born in Elkhorn, West Virginia, and grew up in New Jersey. Starting in the late 1950s, he was a founding member of doo wop vocal group The Parliaments, led by George Clinton. The group originated as a barbershop quintet in the back room of a barber shop on West 3rd Street in Plainfield, New Jersey. Haskins often sang lead in the group. They started traveling to Detroit, Michigan on weekends in order to audition for Motown Records and to participate in the fertile music scene there . The Parliaments released singles on several record labels, but did not have a hit until 1967 when &quot;(I Wanna) Testify,&quot; on the small Detroit imprint Revilot Records, reached #3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B singles chart. The song was actually recorded by George Clinton and a group called The Holidays, as the other Parliaments didn&#x27;t make it to Detroit that week. Revilot went out of business, and in the process, the group lost their name, The Parliaments.

==Career==
By 1970, the five Parliaments singers were touring with five backing musicians known separately as Funkadelic. The highly rehearsed performances and suited look of The Parliaments gave way to the members dressing in their own outrageous styles. Haskins wore long johns on stage. Due to the contractual issues surrounding the group name, Clinton signed the band as Funkadelic to Westbound Records. The ensemble released their first album &quot;Funkadelic&quot; in 1970. Clinton also renamed his group of singers Parliament (but still with the Funkadelic musicians as official members) and signed that act to the Holland-Dozier-Holland-owned record label, Invictus. Parliament released their first album &quot;Osmium&quot; in 1970. Clinton now had two groups that were actually one entity. Under the name Funkadelic, the ensemble was geared towards a rock audience, and as Parliament it was aimed at a soul music audience. Collectively, they became known as Parliament-Funkadelic, or P-Funk. Haskins contributed to P-Funk as a writer through 1972. He toured and appeared on P-Funk albums as a singer, and occasionally as a guitarist, throughout the 1970s. In June 1977 at the height of P-Funk&#x27;s popularity, Haskins (along with other original Parliaments Calvin Simon and Grady Thomas) left the ensemble over financial and management disputes with Clinton.

Haskins released his first solo album, &quot;A Whole Nother Thang&quot;, in 1976. The album featured P-Funk members: Tiki Fulwood and Cordell &quot;Boogie&quot; Mosson on drums, and Bootsy Collins and Mosson on bass. Bernie Worrell makes an appearance on keyboards, contributing horn and string arrangements as well. Haskins served as producer, singer, songwriter, guitarist and even drummer on one song. Haskins released his second album, &quot;Radio Active&quot;, two years later. An Ace compilation from 1994 reissued both albums on one CD.

In 1981, Haskins, Simon, and Thomas formed a new funk band using the name Funkadelic, appeared on &quot;Soul Train&quot; under that name, and released the album, &quot;Connections &amp; Disconnections&quot;. The album was later reissued on CD with the title &quot;Who&#x27;s a Funkadelic?&quot; in 1992. In the 1990s, Haskins toured with Original P, a group made up of four of the original five Parliaments.

==Personal life and death==
Haskins was married twice, to Estelle James and Lorraine Debney, with both marriages ending in divorce. He had five children, two of whom predeceased him. He lived in Southfield, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit.

Haskins suffered a serious stroke in 2022. He died from complications of diabetes in Grosse Pointe Woods, Michigan, on March 16, 2023, at the age of 81.

<text>The province of Málaga ( ) is located in Andalusia, Spain. It is bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the south and by the provinces of Cádiz to the west, Seville to the northwest, Córdoba to the north, and Granada to the east.

The province is subject to extreme water stress in the wake of the proliferation of avocado plantations in the Axarquía region, with the arid local climate being unsuitable to the plant&#x27;s large water demands.

== Overview ==
The province of Málaga has an area of and a population of 1,652,999 (2013), concentrated mainly in the metropolitan area of Málaga, the provincial capital, and throughout the coastal area.

Besides the capital, the main cities are Marbella, Mijas, Fuengirola, Vélez-Málaga, Torremolinos, Estepona, and Benalmádena, all in the coastal zone. The towns of Antequera and Ronda are located in the interior.

The prevailing climate is a warm Mediterranean, with dry and warm long summers with short mild winters. The geographical relief varies greatly from zone to zone. In general, the coastal zone has a subtropical Mediterranean climate. To the north, a continental Mediterranean climate exists with cold, dry winters and warm summers.

<text>John Howard, 1st Duke of Norfolk , also known as Jack of Norfolk, (22 August 1485), was an English nobleman, soldier, politician, and the first Howard Duke of Norfolk. He was a close friend and loyal supporter of King Richard III, with whom he was slain at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485.

==Family==
John Howard, born about 1425, was the son of Sir Robert Howard (1398–1436) of Tendring Hall, Stoke-by-Nayland, Suffolk by his wife Margaret de Mowbray (1391–1459), eldest daughter of Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk (of the first creation) (1366–1399), by wife Elizabeth FitzAlan (1366–1425). His paternal grandparents were Sir John Howard of Wiggenhall, Norfolk, and wife Alice Tendring, daughter of Sir William Tendring.

Howard was a descendant of English royalty through both sides of his family. On his father&#x27;s side, Howard was descended from Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall, the second son of King John, who had an illegitimate son, named Richard (died 1296), whose daughter, Joan of Cornwall, married Sir John Howard (d. shortly before 23 July 1331). On his mother&#x27;s side, Howard was descended from Thomas of Brotherton, 1st Earl of Norfolk, the elder son of Edward I of England by his second wife, Margaret of France, and from Edward I&#x27;s younger brother, Edmund Crouchback.

==Career==
Howard succeeded his father in 1436 and then his grandfather in 1437. In his youth, he was in the household of his cousin John Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk (died 1461), and was drawn into Norfolk&#x27;s conflicts with William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk. In 1453 he was involved in a lawsuit with Suffolk&#x27;s wife, Alice Chaucer. He had been elected to Parliament in 1449 as Shire knight for Suffolk and during the 1450s he held several local offices. According to Crawford, he was at one point during this period described as &quot;wode as a wilde bullok&quot;. He is said to have been with Lord Lisle in his expedition to Guyenne in 1452, which ended in defeat at Castillon on 17 July 1453. He received an official commission from the King on 10 December 1455 and also had been utilised by Henry to promote friendship between Lord Moleyns (his father-in-law) and one John Clopton.

He was a staunch adherent of the House of York during the Wars of the Roses, and was knighted by King Edward IV at the Battle of Towton on 29 March 1461. In the same year he was appointed Constable of Norwich and Colchester castles, and became part of the royal household as one of the King&#x27;s carvers, &quot;the start of a service to the house of York which was to last for the rest of his life.&quot;

In 1461 Howard was High Sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk, and during the years 1462-4, he took part in military campaigns against the Lancastrians. In 1467 he served as deputy for Norfolk as Earl Marshal at &#x27;the most splendid tournament of the age&#x27; when Antoine, count of La Roche, the Bastard of Burgundy, jousted against the Queen&#x27;s brother, Lord Scales. In the same year he was one of three ambassadors sent to Burgundy to arrange the marriage of the King&#x27;s sister, Margaret of York, to Charles, Duke of Burgundy. At about this time he was made a member of the King&#x27;s council, and in 1468 he was among those who escorted Margaret to Burgundy for her wedding. During the 1460s Howard had become involved in the internal politics of St John&#x27;s Abbey in Colchester, of which he was a patron. He interfered with the abbatial elections at the Abbey following the death of Abbot Ardeley in 1464, helping the Yorkist supporter John Canon to win the election. Howard then appears to have interfered again in support of Abbot Stansted&#x27;s election following Canon&#x27;s death in 1464.

Howard&#x27;s advancement in the King&#x27;s household continued. By 1467 he was a Knight of the Body, and in September 1468 was appointed Treasurer of the Royal Household, an office which he held for only two years, until Edward lost the throne in 1470.

According to Crawford, Howard was a wealthy man by 1470, and when Edward IV&#x27;s first reign ended he went into exile on the continent. In the area around Stoke-by-Nayland Howard held some sixteen manors, seven of which the King had granted him in 1462. After 1463, he purchased a number of other manors, including six forfeited by John de Vere, 12th Earl of Oxford, the son of his cousin, Elizabeth Howard.

Howard was summoned to Parliament from 15 October 1470 by writs directed to &quot;Iohanni Howard de Howard Militi&quot; and &quot;Iohanni Howard Chivaler&quot;, whereby he is held to have become Lord Howard. On 24 April 1472, he was admitted to the Order of the Garter. In 1475 he accompanied Edward in his attempt on France. In 1482 he spent time in Harwich, Essex building up the navy, and made a donation to the Dovercourt shrine.

In April 1483 he bore the royal banner at the funeral of King Edward IV. He supported Richard III&#x27;s accession to the throne, and at his behest took the nine year old Richard of Shrewsbury, the younger son of Edward IV, from Westminster Abbey where he was seeking sanctuary with his mother to the Tower of London to join his brother Edward V, both of whom subsequently disappeared in mysterious circumstances. He was appointed Lord High Steward and bore the crown before Richard at his coronation, while his eldest son, the Earl of Surrey, carried the Sword of State. On 28 June 1483 he was created Duke of Norfolk, third creation, the first creation having become extinct on the death of John de Mowbray, 4th Duke of Norfolk, in 1476, and the second creation having been invalidated by Richard&#x27;s illegitimisation, on 25 June 1483, of Edward IV&#x27;s second son Richard of York. This left John Howard as heir to the duchy, and his alliance with Richard ensured his acquisition of the title. He was also created Earl Marshal, and Lord High Admiral of all England, Ireland, and Aquitaine.

The Duke&#x27;s principal home was at Stoke-by-Nayland (and later Framlingham Castle) in Suffolk. However, after his second marriage he frequently resided at Ockwells Manor at Cox Green in Bray as it was conveniently close to the royal residence at Windsor Castle.

==Marriages and issue==
Before 29 September 1442, he married Catherine (died 3 November 1465), the daughter of Sir William Moleyns (7 January 13788 June 1425), of Stoke Poges in Buckinghamshire, and his wife Margery (died 26 March 1439).
With Catherine Moleyns, he had two sons and four daughters: 
*Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk, Earl of Surrey (144321 May 1524), who married firstly, on 30 April 1472, as her second husband, Elizabeth Tilney, by whom he had ten children including Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, and Elizabeth Howard, wife of Sir Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire; he married secondly, in 1497, Agnes Tilney, by whom he had eleven children.
*Nicholas Howard (died c. 1468).
*Isabel or Elizabeth Howard, who married Robert Mortimer (died 1485), esquire, of Landmere in Thorpe-le-Soken, slain at Bosworth, by whom she had a daughter, Elizabeth, who married George Guildford, younger son of Sir Richard Guildford.
*Anne Howard (1446–1474), who married Sir Edmund Gorges (1442-1512) of Wraxall, by whom she had issue including Sir Edward Gorges (1482-1565), knighted at Flodden (1513) by his uncle, Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk.
*Jane Howard (145015 August 1508), who in 1481 married Sir John Timperley of Hintlesham, Suffolk, without issue.
*Margaret Howard (1445–1484/1524), who married Sir John Wyndham of Crownthorpe and Felbrigg, Norfolk (1443-1503), by whom she had issue (see Wyndham).

Howard married secondly, before 22 January 1467, Margaret (1436–1494), the daughter of Sir John Chedworth and his wife, Margaret Bowett, and widow, firstly of Nicholas Wyfold (1420–1456), Lord Mayor of London, and secondly of Sir John Norreys (14001 September 1466), Master of the Wardrobe.

By his second wife, Margaret Chedworth, he had one daughter:
*Katherine Howard (died 17 March 1536), who married John Bourchier, 2nd Baron Berners, by whom she had issue.

==Death==
As part of his duties as Earl Marshal, John Howard ordered the muster of lords, knights and common soldiers to the abbey at Bury St Edmunds to join Richard III to march on Redemoor Plain, better known as Bosworth Field. He was slain at the Battle of Bosworth Field on 22 August 1485 by the knight Sir John Savage in single combat, according to the Ballad of Lady Bessy. Howard was the commander of the vanguard, and his son, the Earl of Surrey, his lieutenant. Howard&#x27;s death had a demoralising effect on his friend and patron King Richard who was slain later in the battle. There is an alternative telling of events which states that Howard was killed when a Lancastrian arrow struck him in the face after the face guard had been torn off his helmet during an earlier altercation with the Earl of Oxford. Shakespeare relates how, the night before, someone had left John Howard a note attached to his tent warning him that King Richard, his &quot;master&quot;, was going to be double-crossed (which he was):

&quot;Jack of Norfolk, be not too bold,&quot;
&quot;For Dickon, thy master, is bought and sold.&quot;

However, this story does not appear earlier than Edward Hall in 1548, so it may well be an apocryphal embellishment of a later era.

He was buried in Thetford Priory, but his body seems to have been moved at the Reformation, possibly to the tomb of the 3rd Duke of Norfolk at Framlingham Church. The monumental brass of his first wife Katherine Moleyns can, however, still be seen in Suffolk.

Howard was the great-grandfather of Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard, the second and fifth Queens consort, respectively, of King Henry VIII. Thus, through Anne Boleyn, he was the great-great-grandfather of Elizabeth I. After his death, his titles were declared forfeit by King Henry VII, but his son, the 1st Earl of Surrey, was later restored as 2nd Duke (the Barony of Howard, however, remains forfeit). His senior descendants, the Dukes of Norfolk, have been Earls Marshal and Premier Peers of England since the 17th century, and male-line descendants hold the Earldoms of Carlisle, Suffolk, Berkshire and Effingham.

<text>Tales of Kidd Funkadelic is the eighth studio album by the band Funkadelic, released in September 1976. It was their final album on the Westbound record label. The tracks were recorded during the same sessions as their first release for Warner Bros. Records, &quot;Hardcore Jollies&quot;; which was released a month later. Two tracks from &quot;Tales of Kidd Funkadelic&quot;, the single “Undisco Kidd” and the party anthem “Take Your Dead Ass Home!” have been staples in the band’s live performances since the album’s 1976 release, and can be heard on the 1977 Parliament concert album . The album opener “Butt-To-Buttresuscitation” and the song “I’m Never Gonna Tell It” were included in the band’s live shows during the early 2000s. 
The song &quot;Let&#x27;s Take It to the People&quot; has been sampled by hip-hop band A Tribe Called Quest for their song &quot;Everything Is Fair&quot;, on their album &quot;The Low End Theory&quot;.

Kidd Funkadelic was/is the nickname for guitarist Michael Hampton.

<text>Open publishing is a term used by Matthew Arnison in March 2001 to describe the online process of creating text, audio and video news by methods that are fully transparent to the readers. In the early 2000s, the term was widely associated with the online Indymedia network. 

==History==
The aim of open publishing described by Matthew Arnison was that anybody could contribute a story and see it instantly appear in the pool of stories publicly available. Those stories are filtered as little as possible to help the readers find the stories they want. Readers can see editorial decisions being made by others. They can see how to get involved and help make editorial decisions. If they can think of a better way for the software to help shape editorial decisions, they can copy the software because it is free and open source to change it and start their own site. If they want to redistribute the news, they can, preferably on an open publishing site.

Internet sites run on open publishing software allow anyone with Internet access to visit the site and upload content directly without having to penetrate the filters of traditional media. Several fundamental principles tend to inform the organizations and sites dedicated to open publishing, though they do so to varying degrees. These principles include non-hierarchy, public participation, minimal editorial control, and transparency.

== Related ideas ==
Arnison&#x27;s idea of open publishing can be compared to Eric S. Raymond&#x27;s point of view in the open source software versus free software debate. Given a large enough audience of peers, readers and/or commentators, supporters of open publishing hope or expect that almost all problematic content will quickly be noticed, highlighted and fixed. Linus&#x27;s law could in this be context be described as Arnison&#x27;s Law, reworded as, &quot;Given enough eyeballs, problematic content is shallow&quot;.

The term &quot;open publishing&quot; is intended to be much more open than the more restricted idea of open access publishing, in which the publishing of material organized in such a way that there is no financial or other barrier to the reader, but there is no claim for transparency in the methods and procedures of publishing. In other words, open publishing is open access, but open access publishing is only sometimes &quot;open publishing&quot;.

== Examples ==
Online historical and existing networks typically associated with open publishing include the Independent Media Center network, Kuro5hin, Slashdot, Wikipedia and Wikinews.

<text>Jerry Chamberlain is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and producer, best known for his work with the rock bands Daniel Amos and the Swirling Eddies (credited as &quot;Spot&quot;).

In late 1974, Chamberlain was asked to join Jubal&#x27;s Last Band, a band that consisted of Terry Scott Taylor, Steve Baxter and bassist Kenny Paxton. Marty Dieckmeyer was soon brought in as a replacement for the departing Paxton. Sometime in the middle of 1975, Jubal&#x27;s Last Band or Jubal (as a shortened form of the name was briefly used) auditioned for Maranatha! Music and Calvary Chapel (without Baxter, who couldn&#x27;t get off work) in hopes of signing a recording and performance contract. At a Maranatha Music meeting, another band led by Darrell Mansfield, was
also using the name, Jubal. The two bands decided to change their names to avoid confusion. Mansfield renamed his band &quot;Gentle Faith&quot;, and Jubal&#x27;s Last Band/Jubal became Daniel Amos.

Daniel Amos succeeded in landing a recording and performance contract, and quickly recorded their first song for the label, Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t Gonna Fight It&quot; for the Maranatha 5 compilation. A full album, produced by Al Perkins, followed. Chamberlain quickly became an important part in the sound of D.A. In the band&#x27;s early days of country/rock, Chamberlain would often launch into a rock and roll guitar solo inappropriately in the middle of &quot;Happily Married Man.&quot; In the later years, his guitar playing drove songs like &quot;Endless Summer&quot; and &quot;I Love You #19&quot;.

Although Chamberlain left DA in late 1983, he did return on a few later albums including &quot;MotorCycle&quot; (1993) (which he co-produced), &quot;BibleLand&quot; (1994) and &quot;Songs of the Heart&quot; (1995).

In 2001, Chamberlain and Sharon McCall recorded a song (&quot;Message from the Country&quot;) with pop rocker Doug Powell, drummer Ken Coomer (Wilco, Uncle Tupelo) and session musician Jonathan Yudkin for the Jeff Lynne tribute &quot;Lynne Me Your Ears&quot; (2002) under the moniker, The Balls of France.

The years 2004–2005 saw Chamberlain and McCall join forces with friends to form an all-British Invasion outfit called The Pickled Beats. The band continues, with slight lineup changes, to play the occasional live performance.

In 2006, Chamberlain once again joined forces with Terry Taylor by lending a hand on the Lost Dogs album &quot;The Lost Cabin and the Mystery Trees&quot;. Chamberlain also returned to his Swirling Eddies pseudonym &quot;Spot,&quot; for the 2007 release &quot;The midget, the speck and the molecule.&quot;

After meeting and doing gigs together over 30 years ago in California, Chamberlain and Pam Mark Hall joined forces as the duo, Pamelita and Parker, in late 2008.

<text>Black comedy, also known as black humor, bleak comedy, dark comedy, dark humor, gallows humor or morbid humor, is a style of comedy that makes light of subject matter that is generally considered taboo, particularly subjects that are normally considered serious or painful to discuss. Writers and comedians often use it as a tool for exploring vulgar issues by provoking discomfort, serious thought, and amusement for their audience. Thus, in fiction, for example, the term &quot;black comedy&quot; can also refer to a genre in which dark humor is a core component. Cartoonist Charles Addams was famous for such humor, e.g. depicting a boy decorating his bedroom with stolen warning signs including
&quot;NO DIVING – POOL EMPTY&quot;, &quot;STOP – BRIDGE OUT&quot; and &quot;SPRING CONDEMNED.&quot;

Black comedy differs from both blue comedy—which focuses more on crude topics such as nudity, sex, and body fluids—and from straightforward obscenity. Whereas the term &quot;black comedy&quot; is a relatively broad term covering humor relating to many serious subjects, &quot;gallows humor&quot; tends to be used more specifically in relation to death, or situations that are reminiscent of dying. Black humor can occasionally be related to the grotesque genre. Literary critics have associated black comedy and black humor with authors as early as the ancient Greeks with Aristophanes.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;black humor&quot; (from the French &quot;humour noir&quot;) was coined by the Surrealist theorist André Breton in 1935 while interpreting the writings of Jonathan Swift. Breton&#x27;s preference was to identify some of Swift&#x27;s writings as a subgenre of comedy and satire in which laughter arises from cynicism and skepticism, often relying on topics such as death.

Breton coined the term for his 1940 book &quot;Anthology of Black Humor&quot; (&quot;Anthologie de l&#x27;humour noir&quot;), in which he credited Jonathan Swift as the originator of black humor and gallows humor (particularly in his pieces &quot;Directions to Servants&quot; (1731), &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot; (1729), &quot;Meditation Upon a Broomstick&quot; (1710), and in a few aphorisms). In his book, Breton also included excerpts from 45 other writers, including both examples in which the wit arises from a victim with which the audience empathizes, as is more typical in the tradition of gallows humor, and examples in which the comedy is used to mock the victim. In the last cases, the victim&#x27;s suffering is trivialized, which leads to sympathizing with the victimizer, as analogously found in the social commentary and social criticism of the writings of (for instance) Sade.

== History ==

Among the first American writers who employed black comedy in their works were Nathanael West and Vladimir Nabokov. The concept of black humor first came to nationwide attention after the publication of a 1965 mass-market paperback titled &quot;Black Humor&quot;, edited by Bruce Jay Friedman. The paperback was one of the first American anthologies devoted to the concept of black humor as a literary genre. With the paperback, Friedman labeled as &quot;black humorists&quot; a variety of authors, such as J. P. Donleavy, Edward Albee, Joseph Heller, Thomas Pynchon, John Barth, Vladimir Nabokov, Bruce Jay Friedman himself, and Louis-Ferdinand Céline. Among the recent writers suggested as black humorists by journalists and literary critics are Roald Dahl, Kurt Vonnegut, Warren Zevon, Christopher Durang, Philip Roth, and Veikko Huovinen. Evelyn Waugh has been called &quot;the first contemporary writer to produce the sustained black comic novel.&quot; The motive for applying the label black humorist to the writers cited above is that they have written novels, poems, stories, plays, and songs in which profound or horrific events were portrayed in a comic manner. Comedians like Lenny Bruce, who since the late 1950s have been labeled as using &quot;sick comedy&quot; by mainstream journalists, have also been labeled with &quot;black comedy&quot;.

== Nature and functions ==

Sigmund Freud, in his 1927 essay &quot;Humor&quot; (&quot;Der Humor&quot;), although not mentioning &#x27;black humor&#x27; specifically, cites a literal instance of gallows humor before going on to write: &quot;The ego refuses to be distressed by the provocations of reality, to let itself be compelled to suffer. It insists that it cannot be affected by the traumas of the external world; it shows, in fact, that such traumas are no more than occasions for it to gain pleasure.&quot; Some other sociologists elaborated this concept further. At the same time, Paul Lewis warns that this &quot;relieving&quot; aspect of gallows jokes depends on the context of the joke: whether the joke is being told by the threatened person themselves or by someone else.

Black comedy has the social effect of strengthening the morale of the oppressed and undermines the morale of the oppressors. According to Wylie Sypher, &quot;to be able to laugh at evil and error means we have surmounted them.&quot;

Black comedy is a natural human instinct and examples of it can be found in stories from antiquity. Its use was widespread in middle Europe, from where it was imported to the United States. It is rendered with the German expression &quot;Galgenhumor&quot; (cynical last words before getting hanged). The concept of gallows humor is comparable to the French expression &quot;rire jaune&quot; (lit. &quot;yellow laughing&quot;), which also has a Germanic equivalent in the Belgian Dutch expression &quot;groen lachen&quot; (lit. &quot;green laughing&quot;).

Italian comedian Daniele Luttazzi discussed gallows humor focusing on the particular type of laughter that it arouses (&quot;risata verde&quot; or &quot;groen lachen&quot;), and said that grotesque satire, as opposed to ironic satire, is the one that most often arouses this kind of laughter. In the Weimar era &quot;Kabaretts&quot;, this genre was particularly common, and according to Luttazzi, Karl Valentin and Karl Kraus were the major masters of it.

Black comedy is common in professions and environments where workers routinely have to deal with dark subject matter. This includes police officers, firefighters, ambulance crews, military personnel, journalists, lawyers, and funeral directors, where it is an acknowledged coping mechanism. It has been encouraged within these professions to make note of the context in which these jokes are told, as outsiders may not react the way that those with mutual knowledge do.

A 2017 study published in the journal &quot;Cognitive Processing&quot; concludes that people who appreciate dark humor &quot;may have higher IQs, show lower aggression, and resist negative feelings more effectively than people who turn up their noses at it.&quot;

== Examples ==

=== Gallows speeches ===
Examples of gallows speeches include:

* In Edo period Japan, condemned criminals were occasionally executed by expert swordsmen, who used living bodies to test the quality of their blade (&quot;Tameshigiri&quot;). There is an apocryphal story of one who, after being told he was to be executed by a sword tester, calmly joked that if he had known that was going to happen, he would have swallowed large stones to damage the blade.
* As Thomas More climbed a rickety scaffold where he would be executed, he said to his executioner: &quot;I pray you, Mr. Lieutenant, see me safe up; and for my coming down, let me shift for myself.&quot;
* Robert-François Damiens, a French man who attempted to assassinate King Louis XV, was sentenced on 26 March 1757, to be executed in a gruesome and painstakingly detailed manner. He would first be led to the gallows, holding a torch with two pounds of burning wax. Pliers would then be used to tear his skin at the breast, arms and legs. Then his right arm, which held the knife he had used for his crime, would be burned with sulfur. The aforementioned areas with ripped skin would then be poured upon with molten lead, boiling oil, burning pitch, wax and sulfur. His body would then be dismembered by four horses, the members and trunk consumed in fire, and the ashes would be spread in the wind. After hearing the sentence, Damiens is reported to have replied: &quot;Well, it&#x27;s going to be a tough day.&quot;
* During the French Revolution, Georges-Jacques Danton, who had facial scars from smallpox, when he was about to be beheaded with a guillotine on 5 April 1794, is reported to have said to the executioner: &quot;Don&#x27;t forget to show my head to the people, it&#x27;s well worth it!&quot;
* At his public execution, the murderer William Palmer is said to have looked at the trapdoor on the gallows and asked the hangman, &quot;Are you sure it&#x27;s safe?&quot;
* Murderer James French, days prior to his death by electric chair, said to reporter Bob Gregory: &quot;If I were covering my execution, do you know what I&#x27;d say in the newspaper headline? ... &#x27;French Fries&#x27;. See ya.&quot;
* John Amery, hanged for treason in 1945, said to the executioner Albert Pierrepoint &quot;I&#x27;ve always wanted to meet you, Mr. Pierrepoint, though not of course under these circumstances!&quot;
* Neville Heath was hanged for murder in 1946. A few minutes prior to his execution, as was the custom, Heath was offered a glass of whisky to steady his nerves by the prison governor. He replied, &quot;While you&#x27;re about it, sir, you might make that a double.&quot;
*Saint Lawrence, after distributing treasures of the Church to the poor rather than turning them over to the prefect of Rome who demanded them as tribute, was martyred in the year 258 by being grilled alive upon a gridiron with hot coals beneath. It is reported that after a long while of enduring this torture, he quipped cheerfully to his executioners: &quot;I&#x27;m well done on this side. Turn me over!&quot;

===Military===

Military life is full of gallows humor, as those in the services continuously live in the danger of being killed, especially in wartime. For example:
* The Imperial Japanese Navy Mitsubishi G4M (code named Betty bomber) bomber aircraft was called , meaning cigar by the Japanese crews not only because its fuselage was cigar-shaped, but because it had a tendency to ignite and burn violently when it was hit.
* When the survivors of , sunk in 1982 in the Falklands War, were awaiting rescue, they were reported to have sung the Monty Python song, &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot;.
* Soviet pilots in World War II joked that the true meaning of the type designation of the LaGG-3 was &quot;Лакированный Гарантированный Гроб&quot; (romanized: &quot;Lakirovannyy Garantirovannyy Grob&quot;), &quot;varnished guaranteed coffin&quot;.
* In World War II, American escort carriers had the hull classification code &quot;CVE&quot;; among their crews, CVE was sarcastically said to stand for &quot;Combustible, Vulnerable, and Expendable&quot;. CVEs were called &quot;Kaiser coffins&quot; in honor of Casablanca-class manufacturer Henry J. Kaiser.
* American tanks of the Second World War, such as the M3 Lee medium tank, which were supplied to the USSR under the Lend-Lease program, got sarcastic name interpretations from Soviet soldiers. Thus, the letter sign &quot;BM-7&quot; (&quot;General Lee&quot; model) was understood as &quot;братская могила на семерых&quot; (romanized: &quot;bratskaya mogila na semerykh&quot;), and similarly, &quot;BM-6&quot; (&quot;General Grant&quot; model) as &quot;братская могила на шестерых&quot; (romanized: &quot;bratskaya mogila na shesterykh&quot;), meaning &quot;mass grave for seven/six crewmen&quot; – as penetrative hits would fragment inside the vehicles, killing the crew. Similar name reinterpretations were created for domestic multi-turreted tanks, chiefly the T-28 medium tank and T-35 heavy tank models, for their cramped internal layouts and poor armor protection.
* In the Battle of Jutland (31 May – 1 June 1916), the destroyer was sunk in an overnight engagement with the heavily armed German dreadnought . Only 13 crewmen survived out of a complement of 197 officers &amp; men. The survivors were identified in the darkness by the crew of because they were heard in the distance, singing, &quot;It&#x27;s a long way to Tipperary&quot;.

===Emergency service workers===
Workers in the emergency services are also known for using black comedy:
*Graham Wettone, a retired English police officer who wrote a book &quot;How To Be A Police Officer&quot;, noted the presence of black comedy in the police force. He described it as &quot;often not the type of humor that can be understood outside policing or the other emergency services.&quot; For example, an officer who had attended four cases of suicide by hanging in six months was nicknamed &quot;Albert&quot; (after the hangman Albert Pierrepoint) and encountered comments like &quot;You hanging around the canteen today?&quot;
*In 2018, a Massachusetts firefighter was reprimanded for a response to a call about a cat stuck in a tree. The firefighter told the caller that the cat would probably make its own way down as he had never seen a cat skeleton in a tree before. An opinion article in &quot;Fire Chief&quot; magazine said that these kinds of jokes were common in the fire service, but would be inappropriate to share with a concerned member of the public.

===Other===

There are several titles such as &quot;It Only Hurts When I Laugh&quot; and &quot;Only When I Laugh&quot;, which allude to the punch line of a joke which exists in numerous versions since at least the 19th century. A typical setup is that someone badly hurt is asked &quot;Does it hurt?&quot; – &quot;I am fine; it only hurts when I laugh.&quot;

<text>In organic chemistry, xylene or xylol (; IUPAC name: dimethylbenzene) are any of three organic compounds with the formula . They are derived from the substitution of two hydrogen atoms with methyl groups in a benzene ring; which hydrogens are substituted determines which of three structural isomers results. It is a colorless, flammable, slightly greasy liquid of great industrial value. 

The mixture is referred to as both xylene and, more precisely, xylenes. Mixed xylenes refers to a mixture of the xylenes plus ethylbenzene. The four compounds have identical molecular formulas . Typically the four compounds are produced together by various catalytic reforming and pyrolysis methods.

==Occurrence and production==
Xylenes are an important petrochemical produced by catalytic reforming and also by coal carbonisation in the manufacture of coke fuel. They also occur in crude oil in concentrations of about 0.5–1%, depending on the source. Small quantities occur in gasoline and aircraft fuels.

Xylenes are produced mainly as part of the BTX aromatics (benzene, toluene, and xylenes) extracted from the product of catalytic reforming known as reformate.

Several million tons are produced annually. In 2011, a global consortium began construction of one of the world&#x27;s largest xylene plants in Singapore.

==History==
Xylene was first isolated and named in 1850 by the French chemist Auguste Cahours (1813–1891), having been discovered as a constituent of wood tar.

==Industrial production==
Xylenes are produced by the methylation of toluene and benzene. Commercial or laboratory-grade xylene produced usually contains about 40–65% of &quot;m&quot;-xylene and up to 20% each of &quot;o&quot;-xylene, &quot;p&quot;-xylene and ethylbenzene. The ratio of isomers can be shifted to favor the highly valued &quot;p&quot;-xylene via the patented UOP-&quot;Isomar&quot; process or by transalkylation of xylene with itself or trimethylbenzene. These conversions are catalyzed by zeolites.

ZSM-5 is used to facilitate some isomerization reactions leading to mass production of modern plastics.

==Properties==
The physical properties of the isomers of xylene differ slightly. The melting point ranges from (&quot;m&quot;-xylene) to (&quot;p&quot;-xylene)—as usual, the para isomer&#x27;s melting point is much higher because it packs more readily in the crystal structure. The boiling point for each isomer is around . The density of each isomer is around and thus is less dense than water. The odor of xylene is detectable at concentrations as low as 0.08 to 3.7 ppm (parts of xylene per million parts of air) and can be tasted in water at 0.53 to 1.8 ppm.


Xylenes form azeotropes with water and a variety of alcohols. The azeotrope with water consists of 60% xylenes and boils at 94.5 °C. As with many alkylbenzene compounds, xylenes form complexes with various halocarbons. The complexes of different isomers often have dramatically different properties from each other.

==Applications==

===Terephthalic acid and related derivatives===
&quot;p&quot;-Xylene is the principal precursor to terephthalic acid and dimethyl terephthalate, both monomers used in the production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottles and polyester clothing. 98% of &quot;p&quot;-xylene production, and half of all xylenes produced is consumed in this manner. &quot;o&quot;-Xylene is an important precursor to phthalic anhydride. The demand for isophthalic acid is relatively modest, so &quot;m&quot;-xylene is rarely sought (and hence the utility of its conversion to the &quot;o&quot;- and &quot;p&quot;-isomers).

===Solvent applications and industrial purposes ===
Xylenes are used as a solvent in printing, rubber, and leather industries. It is a common component of ink, rubber, and adhesives. In thinning paints and varnishes, it can be substituted for toluene where slower drying is desired, and thus is used by conservators of art objects in solubility testing. Similarly it is a cleaning agent, e.g., for steel, silicon wafers, and integrated circuits. In dentistry, xylene can be used to dissolve gutta percha, a material used for endodontics (root-canal treatments). In the petroleum industry, xylene is also a frequent component of paraffin solvents, used when the tubing becomes clogged with paraffin wax.

===Laboratory use===
Xylene is used in the laboratory to make baths with dry ice to cool reaction vessels, and as a solvent to remove synthetic immersion oil from the microscope objective in light microscopy. In histology, xylene is the most widely used clearing agent. Xylene is used to remove paraffin from dried microscope slides prior to staining. After staining, microscope slides are put in xylene prior to mounting with a coverslip.

===Precursor to other compounds===
In one large-scale application, para-xylene is converted to terephthalic acid. The major application of ortho-xylene is as a precursor to phthalate esters, used as plasticizer. Meta-xylene is converted to isophthalic acid derivatives, which are components of alkyd resins.

==Chemical properties==
Generally, two kinds of reactions occur with xylenes: those involving the methyl groups and those involving the ring C–H bonds. Being benzylic and hence weakened, the C–H bonds of the methyl groups are susceptible to free-radical reactions, including halogenation to the corresponding xylene dichlorides (bis(chloromethyl)benzenes), while mono-bromination yields xylyl bromide, a tear gas agent. Oxidation and ammoxidation also target the methyl groups, affording dicarboxylic acids and the dinitriles. Electrophiles attack the aromatic ring, leading to chloro- and nitroxylenes.

==Health and safety==
Xylene is flammable but of modest acute toxicity, with ranges from 200 to 5000 mg/kg for animals. Oral for rats is 4300 mg/kg. The principal mechanism of detoxification is oxidation to methylbenzoic acid and hydroxylation to hydroxylene.

The main effect of inhaling xylene vapor is depression of the central nervous system (CNS), with symptoms such as headache, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. At an exposure of 100 ppm, one may experience nausea or a headache. At an exposure between 200 and 500 ppm, symptoms can include feeling &quot;high&quot;, dizziness, weakness, irritability, vomiting, and slowed reaction time.

The side effects of exposure to low concentrations of xylene () are reversible and do not cause permanent damage. Long-term exposure may lead to headaches, irritability, depression, insomnia, agitation, extreme tiredness, tremors, hearing loss, impaired concentration and short-term memory loss. A condition called chronic solvent-induced encephalopathy, commonly known as &quot;organic-solvent syndrome&quot; has been associated with xylene exposure. There is very little information available that isolates xylene from other solvent exposures in the examination of these effects.

Hearing disorders have been also linked to xylene exposure, both from studies with experimental animals, as well as clinical studies.

Xylene is also a skin irritant and strips the skin of its oils, making it more permeable to other chemicals. The use of impervious gloves and masks, along with respirators where appropriate, is recommended to avoid occupational health issues from xylene exposure.

Xylenes are metabolized to methylhippuric acids. The presence of methylhippuric acid can be used as a biomarker to determine exposure to xylene.

<doc id="118372" wikidata="Q134114" url="?curid=118372" title="Battle of Austerlitz">
<text>The Battle of Austerlitz (2 December 1805/11 Frimaire An XIV FRC), also known as the Battle of the Three Emperors, was one of the most important military engagements of the Napoleonic Wars. The battle occurred near the town of Austerlitz in the Austrian Empire (now Slavkov u Brna in the Czech Republic). Around 158,000 troops were involved, of which around 24,000 were killed or wounded. 

The battle is often cited by military historians as one of Napoleon&#x27;s tactical masterpieces, in the same league as other historic engagements like Cannae or Gaugamela. The military victory of Napoleon&#x27;s at Austerlitz brought the War of the Third Coalition to an end, with the Peace of Pressburg signed by the French and Austrians later in the month. These achievements did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. Austerlitz had driven neither Russia nor Britain, whose armies protected Sicily from a French invasion, to settle. Prussian resistance to France&#x27;s growing military power in Central Europe led to the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806.

After eliminating an Austrian army during the Ulm campaign, French forces seized Vienna in November 1805. The Austrians avoided further conflict until the arrival of the Russians, who helped increase the allied numbers. Napoleon sent his army north in pursuit of the Allies but then ordered his forces to retreat so he could feign a grave weakness to lure the Allies into thinking that they were facing a weak army, while it was in fact formidable. Napoleon gave every indication in the days preceding the engagement that the French army was in a pitiful state, even abandoning the dominant Pratzen Heights near Austerlitz. He deployed the French army below the Pratzen Heights and weakened his right flank, enticing the Allies to launch an assault there to roll up the French line. A forced march from Vienna by Marshal Davout and his III Corps plugged the gap left by Napoleon just in time. The Allied deployment against the French right weakened the Allied centre on the Pratzen Heights, which was attacked by the IV Corps of Marshal Soult. With the Allied center demolished, the French swept through both flanks and routed the Allies, which enabled the French to capture thousands of prisoners.

The Allied disaster significantly shook the will of Emperor Francis to further resist Napoleon. France and Austria agreed to an armistice immediately, and the Treaty of Pressburg followed shortly after, on 26 December. Pressburg took Austria out of both the war and the Coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of Campo Formio and of Lunéville between the two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian loss of lands in Italy and Bavaria to France, and in Germany to Napoleon&#x27;s German allies. It also imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the Habsburgs and allowed the fleeing Russian troops free passage through hostile territories and back to their home soil. Critically, victory at Austerlitz permitted the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine, a collection of German states intended as a buffer zone between France and the eastern powers, Austria, Prussia and Russia. The Confederation rendered the Holy Roman Empire virtually useless, so Francis dissolved the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, but remained as emperor of Austria. These achievements failed to establish a lasting peace on the continent. Prussian worries about the growing French influence in Central Europe led to the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806.

==Background==
Europe had been in turmoil since the start of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1792. In 1797, after five years of war, the French Republic subdued the First Coalition, an alliance of Austria, Prussia, Great Britain, Spain, and various Italian states. A Second Coalition, led by Britain, Austria and Russia, and including the Ottoman Empire, Portugal and the Kingdom of Naples, was formed in 1798, but by 1801, this too had been defeated, leaving the British the only opponent of the new French Consulate. In March 1802, France and Britain agreed to end hostilities under the Treaty of Amiens.

However, many problems persisted between the two sides, making implementation of the treaty increasingly difficult. The British government resented having to return the Cape Colony and most of the Dutch West Indies to the Batavian Republic. Napoleon was angry that the British refused to abandon the island of Malta. The tense situation only worsened when Napoleon sent an expeditionary force to restore French authority and slavery in Saint-Domingue. In May 1803, Britain declared war on France.

===Third Coalition===
In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish agreement led to the creation of the Third Coalition. British Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger spent 1804 and 1805 in a flurry of diplomatic activity geared towards forming a new coalition against France, and by April 1805, Britain and Russia had signed an alliance. Having been defeated twice in recent memory by France and being keen on revenge, Austria joined the Coalition a few months later.

==Forces==
===French Imperial army===
Before the formation of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force called the &quot;Armée d&#x27;Angleterre&quot; (Army of England) around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France. He intended to use this force, amounting to 150,000 men, to strike at England and was so confident of success that he had commemorative medals struck to celebrate the conquest of the English. Although they never invaded, Napoleon&#x27;s troops received careful and invaluable training for any possible military operation. Boredom among the troops occasionally set in, but Napoleon paid many visits and conducted lavish parades to boost morale.

The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon would later call . The army was organized into seven corps, which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 cannons each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to their aid. A single corps (adequately situated in a solid defensive position) could survive at least a day without support. In addition to these forces, Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 organized into two cuirassier divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 artillery pieces. By 1805, the had grown to a force of 350,000 men, who were well equipped, well trained, and led by competent officers.

===Russian Imperial army===
The Russian army in 1805 had many characteristics of Ancien Régime organization. There was no permanent formation above the regimental level, and senior officers mostly belonged to aristocratic circles. The Russian infantry was considered one of the hardiest in Europe, with fine artillery crewed by experienced professional soldiers.

===Austrian Imperial army===
Archduke Charles, brother of the Austrian Emperor, had started to reform the Austrian army in 1801 by taking away power from the , the military-political council responsible for the armed forces. Charles was Austria&#x27;s most able field commander, but he was unpopular at court and lost much influence when, against his advice, Austria decided to go to war with France. Karl Mack became the new main commander in Austria&#x27;s army, instituting reforms on the eve of the war that called for a regiment to be composed of four battalions of four companies, rather than three battalions of six companies.

==Preliminary moves==
In August 1805, Napoleon, Emperor of the French since December of the previous year, turned his sights from the English Channel to the Rhine to deal with the new Austrian and Russian threats. On 25 September after a feverish march in great secrecy, 200,000 French troops began to cross the Rhine on a front of . Mack had gathered the greater part of the Austrian army at the fortress of Ulm in Swabia.

Napoleon swung his forces southward in a wheeling movement that put the French at the Austrian rear while launching cavalry attacks through the Black Forest, which kept the Austrians at bay. The Ulm Maneuver was well-executed, and on 20 October, 23,000 Austrian troops surrendered at Ulm, bringing the number of Austrian prisoners of the campaign to 60,000. Although this spectacular victory was soured by the defeat of a Franco-Spanish fleet at Trafalgar the following day, French success on land continued as Vienna fell in November. The French gained 100,000 muskets, 500 cannons, and intact bridges across the Danube.

Russian delays prevented them from saving the Austrian armies; the Russians withdrew to the northeast to await reinforcements and link up with surviving Austrian units. Tsar Alexander I appointed general Mikhail Illarionovich Kutuzov commander-in-chief of the combined Russo-Austrian force. On 9 September 1805, Kutuzov arrived at the battlefield, quickly contacting Francis I of Austria and his courtiers to discuss strategy and logistics. Under pressure from Kutuzov, the Austrians agreed to supply munitions and weapons promptly. Kutuzov also spotted shortcomings in the Austrian defense plan, which he called &quot;very dogmatic&quot;. He objected to the Austrian annexation of the land recently under Napoleon&#x27;s control because this would make the local people distrust the allied force.

The French followed after Kutuzov but soon found themselves in a difficult position. Prussian intentions were unknown and could be hostile; the Russian and Austrian armies had converged, and French lines of communication were extremely long, requiring strong garrisons to keep them open. Napoleon realized that to capitalize on the success at Ulm, he had to force the Allies to battle and then defeat them.

On the Russian side, Kutuzov also realized Napoleon needed to do battle, so instead of clinging to the &quot;suicidal&quot; Austrian defense plan, Kutuzov decided to retreat. He ordered Pyotr Bagration to contain the French at Vienna with 600 soldiers. He instructed Bagration to accept Murat&#x27;s ceasefire proposal so the Allied Army could have more time to retreat. It was later discovered that the proposal was false and had been used to launch a surprise attack on Vienna. Nonetheless, Bagration held off the French assault for a time by negotiating an armistice with Murat, thereby providing Kutuzov time to position himself with the Russian rearguard near Hollabrunn.

Murat initially refrained from an attack, believing the entire Russian army stood before him. Napoleon soon realized Murat&#x27;s mistakes and ordered him to pursue quickly, but the allied army had already retreated to Olmütz. According to Kutuzov&#x27;s plan, the Allies would retreat further to the Carpathian region and &quot;at Galicia, I will bury the French.&quot;

Napoleon did not stay still. The French Emperor decided to set a psychological trap to lure the Allies out. Days before any fighting, Napoleon had been giving the impression that his army was weak and desired a negotiated peace. About 53,000 French troops—including Soult, Lannes, and Murat&#x27;s forces—were assigned to take Austerlitz and the Olmütz road, occupying the enemy&#x27;s attention. The Allied forces, numbering about 89,000, seemed far superior and would be tempted to attack the outnumbered French army. However, the Allies did not know that Bernadotte, Mortier and Davout were already within supporting distance and could be called in by forced marches -- Bernadotte from Iglau, and Mortier and Davout from Vienna -- which would raise the French number to 75,000 troops.

Napoleon&#x27;s lure did not stop at that. On 25 November, General Savary was sent to the Allied headquarters at Olmütz to deliver Napoleon&#x27;s message, expressing his desire to avoid a battle while secretly examining the Allied forces&#x27; situation. As expected, the overture was seen as a sign of weakness. When Francis I offered an armistice on the 27th, Napoleon accepted enthusiastically. On the same day, Napoleon ordered Soult to abandon both Austerlitz and the Pratzen Heights and, while doing so, to create an impression of chaos during the retreat that would induce the enemy to occupy the Heights.

The next day (28 November), the French Emperor requested a personal interview with Alexander I. He received a visit from the Tsar&#x27;s most impetuous aide, Prince Peter Dolgorukov. The meeting was another part of the trap, as Napoleon intentionally expressed anxiety and hesitation to his opponents. Dolgorukov reported an additional indication of French weakness to the Tsar.

The plan was successful. Many Allied officers, including the Tsar&#x27;s aides and the Austrian Chief of Staff Franz von Weyrother, strongly supported an immediate attack and appeared to sway Tsar Alexander. Kutuzov&#x27;s plan to retreat further to the Carpathian region was rejected, and the Allied forces soon fell into Napoleon&#x27;s trap.

==Battle==
The battle began with the French army outnumbered. Napoleon had some 72,000 men and 157 guns for the impending battle, with about 7,000 troops under Davout still far to the south in the direction of Vienna. The Allies had about 85,000 soldiers, seventy percent of them Russian, and 318 guns.

At first, Napoleon was not confident of victory. In a letter written to Minister of Foreign Affairs Talleyrand, Napoleon requested Talleyrand not tell anyone about the upcoming battle because he did not want to disturb Empress Joséphine. According to Frederick C. Schneid, the French Emperor&#x27;s chief worry was how he could explain to Joséphine a French defeat.

===Battlefield===
The battle took place about six miles (ten kilometres) southeast of the city of Brno, between that city and Austerlitz () in what is now the Czech Republic. The northern part of the battlefield was dominated by the 700-foot (210-metre) Santon Hill and the 880-foot (270-meter) Žuráň Hill, both overlooking the vital Olomouc/Brno road, which was on an east–west axis. To the west of these two hills was the village of Bellowitz (Bedřichovice), and between them, the Bosenitz (Roketnice) stream went south to link up with the Goldbach (Říčka) stream, the latter flowing by the villages of Kobelnitz (Kobylnice), Sokolnitz (Sokolnice), and Telnitz (Telnice).

The centrepiece of the entire area was the Pratzen (Prace) Heights, a gently sloping hill about 35 to 40 feet (10 to 12 metres) in height. An aide noted that Napoleon repeatedly told his marshals, &quot;Gentlemen, examine this ground carefully, it is going to be a battlefield; you will have a part to play upon it.&quot;

===Allied plans and dispositions===
The Allied council met on 1 December to discuss proposals for the battle. Most Allied strategists had two fundamental ideas: contacting the enemy and securing the southern flank that held the communication line to Vienna. Although the Tsar and his immediate entourage pushed hard for a battle, Emperor Francis of Austria was more cautious, and, as mentioned, he was seconded by Kutuzov, the Commander-in-chief of the Russians and the Allied troops. The pressure to fight from the Russian nobles and the Austrian commanders, however, was too strong, and the Allies adopted the plan of the Austrian Chief-of-Staff, Franz von Weyrother. This called for a main drive against the French right flank, which the Allies noticed was lightly guarded, and diversionary attacks against the French left. The Allies deployed most of their troops into four columns that would attack the French right. The Russian Imperial Guard was held in reserve while Russian troops under Bagration guarded the Allied right. The Russian Tsar stripped Kutuzov of his authority as Commander-in-Chief and gave it to Franz von Weyrother. In the battle, Kutuzov could only command the IV Corps of the Allied army, although he was still the nominal commander because the Tsar was afraid to take over if his favoured plan failed.

===French plans and dispositions===
Napoleon hoped that the Allied forces would attack, and to encourage them, he deliberately weakened his right flank. On 28 November, Napoleon met with his marshals at Imperial Headquarters, who informed him of their qualms about the forthcoming battle. He shrugged off their suggestion of retreat.

Napoleon&#x27;s plan envisaged that the Allies would throw many troops to envelop his right flank to cut the French communication line from Vienna. As a result, the Allies&#x27; center and left flank would be exposed and become vulnerable. To encourage them to do so, Napoleon abandoned the strategic position on the Pratzen Heights, faking the weakness of his forces and his caution. Meanwhile, Napoleon&#x27;s main force was to be concealed in a dead ground opposite the Heights. According to the plan, the French troops would attack and recapture the Pratzen Heights, then from the Heights, they would launch a decisive assault to the center of the Allied army, cripple them, and encircle them from the rear.
The massive thrust through the Allied centre was conducted by 16,000 troops of Soult&#x27;s IV Corps. IV Corps&#x27; position was cloaked by dense mist during the early stage of the battle; in fact, how long the mist lasted was vital to Napoleon&#x27;s plan: Soult&#x27;s troops would become uncovered if the mist dissipated too soon, but if it lingered too long, Napoleon would be unable to determine when the Allied troops had evacuated Pratzen Heights, preventing him from timing his attack properly.

Meanwhile, to support his weak right flank, Napoleon ordered Davout&#x27;s III Corps to force march from Vienna and join General Legrand&#x27;s men, who held the extreme southern flank that would bear the heaviest part of the Allied attack. Davout&#x27;s soldiers had 48 hours to march . Their arrival was crucial in determining the success of the French plan. Indeed, the arrangement of Napoleon on the right flank was precarious as the French had only minimal troops garrisoning there. However, Napoleon was able to use such a risky plan because Davout—the commander of III Corps—was one of Napoleon&#x27;s best marshals, because the right flank&#x27;s position was protected by a complicated system of streams and lakes, and because the French had already settled upon a secondary line of retreat through Brunn. The Imperial Guard and Bernadotte&#x27;s I Corps were held in reserve while the V Corps under Lannes guarded the northern sector of the battlefield, where the new communication line was located.

By 1 December 1805, the French troops had been shifted in accordance with the Allied movement southward, as Napoleon expected.

===Battle begins===
The battle began at about 8 a.m., with the first allied lines attacking the village of Telnitz, which the 3rd Line Regiment defended. This battlefield sector witnessed heavy fighting in this early action as several ferocious Allied charges evicted the French from the town and forced them onto the other side of the Goldbach. The first men of Davout&#x27;s corps arrived at this time and threw the Allies out of Telnitz before they, too, were attacked by hussars and re-abandoned the town. Additional Allied attacks out of Telnitz were checked by French artillery.
Allied columns started pouring against the French right, but not at the desired speed, so the French successfully curbed the attacks. The Allied deployments were mistaken and poorly timed: cavalry detachments under Liechtenstein on the Allied left flank had to be placed in the right flank, and in the process, they ran into, and slowed down, part of the second column of infantry that was advancing towards the French right. At the time, the planners thought this slowing was disastrous, but later on, it helped the Allies. Meanwhile, the leading elements of the second column were attacking the village of Sokolnitz, which was defended by the 26th Light Regiment and the Tirailleurs, French skirmishers. Initial Allied assaults proved unsuccessful, and General Langeron ordered the bombardment of the village. This deadly barrage forced the French out, and at about the same time, the third column attacked the castle of Sokolnitz. The French, however, counterattacked and regained the village, only to be thrown out again. Conflict in this area ended temporarily when Friant&#x27;s division (part of III Corps) retook the village. Sokolnitz was perhaps the most contested area on the battlefield and would change hands several times as the day progressed.

While the Allied troops attacked the French right flank, Kutuzov&#x27;s IV Corps stopped at the Pratzen Heights and stayed still. Just like Napoleon, Kutuzov realized the importance of Pratzen and decided to protect the position. But the young Tsar did not, so he ordered the IV Corps to withdraw from the Heights. This act quickly pushed the Allied army into its grave.

===&quot;One sharp blow and the war is over&quot;===
At about 8:45 a.m., satisfied at the weakness in the enemy center, Napoleon asked Soult how long it would take for his men to reach the Pratzen Heights, to which the Marshal replied, &quot;Less than twenty minutes, sire.&quot; About 15 minutes later, Napoleon ordered the attack, adding, &quot;One sharp blow and the war is over.&quot;

A dense fog helped to cloud the advance of St. Hilaire&#x27;s French division, but as they ascended the slope, the legendary &#x27;Sun of Austerlitz&#x27; ripped the mist apart and encouraged them forward. Russian soldiers and commanders on top of the heights were stunned to see so many French troops coming towards them. Allied commanders moved some of the delayed detachments of the fourth column into this bitter struggle. Over an hour of fighting destroyed much of this unit. The other men from the second column, primarily inexperienced Austrians, also participated in the struggle and swung the numbers against one of the best fighting forces in the French army, eventually forcing them to withdraw down the slopes. However, gripped by desperation, St. Hilaire&#x27;s men struck hard again and bayoneted the Allies out of the heights. To the north, General Vandamme&#x27;s division attacked an area called Staré Vinohrady (&quot;Old Vineyards&quot;) and, through talented skirmishing and deadly volleys, broke several Allied battalions.

The battle had firmly turned in France&#x27;s favor, but it was far from over. Napoleon ordered Bernadotte&#x27;s I Corps to support Vandamme&#x27;s left and moved his command center from Žuráň Hill to St. Anthony&#x27;s Chapel on the Pratzen Heights. The problematic position of the Allies was confirmed by the decision to send in the Russian Imperial Guard; Grand Duke Constantine, Tsar Alexander&#x27;s brother, commanded the Guard and counterattacked in Vandamme&#x27;s section of the field, forcing a bloody effort and the only loss of a French standard in the battle (a battalion of the 4th Line Regiment was defeated). Sensing trouble, Napoleon ordered his own heavy Guard cavalry forward. These men pulverized their Russian counterparts, but with both sides pouring in large masses of cavalry, no victory was clear.

The Russians had a numerical advantage; however, the tide soon swung as Drouet&#x27;s Division, the 2nd of Bernadotte&#x27;s I Corps, deployed on the flank of the action and allowed French cavalry to seek refuge behind their lines. The horse artillery of the Guard also inflicted heavy casualties on the Russian cavalry and fusiliers. The Russians broke, and many died as they were pursued by the reinvigorated French cavalry for about a quarter of a mile. Kutuzov was severely wounded, and his son-in-law, Ferdinand von Tiesenhausen, was killed.

===Endgame===

Meanwhile, the northernmost part of the battlefield also witnessed heavy fighting. The Prince of Liechtenstein&#x27;s heavy cavalry began to assault Kellermann&#x27;s lighter cavalry forces after eventually arriving at the correct position in the field. The fighting initially went well for the French, but Kellerman&#x27;s forces took cover behind General Caffarelli&#x27;s infantry division once it became clear that Russian numbers were too great. Caffarelli&#x27;s men halted the Russian assaults and permitted Murat to send two cuirassier divisions (one commanded by d&#x27;Hautpoul and the other one by Nansouty) into the fray to finish off the Russian cavalry for good. The ensuing mêlée was bitter and long, but the French ultimately prevailed. Lannes then led his V Corps against Bagration&#x27;s men and, after hard fighting, drove the skilled Russian commander off the field. He wanted to pursue, but Murat, who was in control of this sector on the battlefield, was against the idea.

Napoleon&#x27;s focus shifted towards the southern end of the battlefield, where the French and the Allies were still fighting over Sokolnitz and Telnitz. In an effective double-pronged assault, St. Hilaire&#x27;s division and part of Davout&#x27;s III Corps smashed through the enemy at Sokolnitz, which persuaded the commanders of the first two columns, Generals Kienmayer and Langeron, to flee as fast as they could. Buxhowden, the commander of the Allied left and the man responsible for leading the attack, was completely drunk and fled as well. Kienmayer covered his withdrawal with the O&#x27;Reilly light cavalry, who managed to defeat five of six French cavalry regiments before they had to retreat.

General panic seized the Allied army, and it abandoned the field in all possible directions. A famous, albeit disputed, episode occurred during this retreat: defeated Russian forces withdrew south towards Vienna via the frozen Satschan ponds. French artillery pounded towards the men, and the ice was broken by the bombardment. The fleeing men drowned in the cold ponds, dozens of Russian artillery pieces going down with them. Estimates of how many guns were captured differ: there may have been as few as 38 or more than 100. Sources also differ about casualties, with figures ranging between 200 and 2,000 dead. Many drowning Russians were saved by their victorious foes. However, local evidence later made public suggests that Napoleon&#x27;s account of the catastrophe may have been exaggerated; on his instructions, the lakes were drained a few days after the battle and the corpses of only two or three men, with some 150 horses, were found. On the other hand, Tsar Alexander I attested to the incident after the wars.

==Military and political results==
Allied casualties stood at about 36,000 out of an army of 89,000, representing about 38% of their effective forces. The French were not unscathed in the battle, losing around 9,000 out of an army of 66,000, or about 13% of their forces. The Allies also lost some 180 guns and about 50 standards. The victory was met by sheer amazement and delirium in Paris, where the nation had been teetering on the brink of financial collapse just days earlier. Napoleon wrote to Josephine, &quot;I have beaten the Austro-Russian army commanded by the two emperors. I am a little weary. ... I embrace you.&quot; Napoleon&#x27;s comments in this letter led to the battle&#x27;s other famous designation, &quot;Battle of the Three Emperors&quot;. However, Napoleon was mistaken as Emperor Francis of Austria was not present on the battlefield. Tsar Alexander perhaps best summed up the harsh times for the Allies by stating, &quot;We are babies in the hands of a giant.&quot; After hearing the news of Austerlitz, Pitt said of a map of Europe, &quot;Roll up that map; it will not be wanted these ten years.&quot;

France and Austria signed a truce on 4 December, and the Treaty of Pressburg 22 days later took the latter out of the war. Austria agreed to recognize French territory captured by the treaties of Campo Formio (1797) and Lunéville (1801), cede land to Bavaria, Württemberg and Baden, which were Napoleon&#x27;s German allies, pay 40 million francs in war indemnities and cede Venice to the Kingdom of Italy. It was a harsh end for Austria but certainly not a catastrophic peace. The Russian army was allowed to withdraw to home territory, and the French ensconced themselves in Southern Germany. The Holy Roman Empire was extinguished, 1806 being seen as its final year. Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, a string of German states meant to serve as a buffer between France and Prussia. Prussia saw these and other moves as an affront to its status as the main power of Central Europe, and it went to war with France in 1806.

==Rewards==
Napoleon&#x27;s words to his troops after the battle were full of praise: &quot;Soldats! Je suis content de vous&quot; ().

Napoleon wrote to his victorious army on the night of Austerlitz with his customary rhetoric:

&quot;Even at this hour, before this great day shall pass and be lost in the ocean of eternity, your emperor just address you, and say how satisfied he is with the conduct of all those who had the good fortune to fight in this memorable battle. Soldiers! You are the finest warriors in the World. The recollection of this day, and of your deeds, will be eternal! Thousands of ages hereafter, as long as the events of the universe continue to be relate, will it be told that a Russian army of 76,000 men, hired by the gold of England, was annihilated by you on the plains of Olmütz.&quot;

The Emperor provided two million golden francs to the higher officers and 200 francs to each soldier, with large pensions for the widows of the fallen, also providing 6,000 Francs for the widows of fallen generals. Orphaned children were adopted by Napoleon personally and were allowed to add &quot;Napoleon&quot; to their baptismal and family names. He could afford this, and much else besides, thanks to the return of financial confidence that swept the country as government bonds leaped from 45% to 66% of their face value on the news of victory.

This battle is one of four for which Napoleon never awarded a victory title, the others being Marengo, Jena, and Friedland.

==In popular culture==
Artists and musicians on the side of France and her conquests expressed their sentiments in the popular and elite art of the time. Prussian music critic E. T. A. Hoffmann, in his famous review of Beethoven&#x27;s 5th Symphony,
singles out for special abuse a certain &quot;Bataille des trois Empereurs&quot;, a French battle symphony by Louis Jadin celebrating Napoleon&#x27;s victory at Austerlitz.

Leo Tolstoy dramatized the battle as the conclusion of Book 3 and Volume 1 of &quot;War and Peace&quot;, making it a crucial moment in the lives of both Andrei Bolkonsky, who is badly wounded, and of Nikolai Rostov.

Archibald Alison in his &quot;History of Europe&quot; (1836) offers the first recorded telling of the apocryphal story that when the Allies descended the Pratzen Heights to attack Napoleon&#x27;s supposedly weak flank,
The marshals who surrounded Napoleon saw the advantage, and eagerly besought him to give the signal for action; but he restrained their ardour ... &quot;when the enemy is making a false movement we must take good care not to interrupt him.&quot; 

In subsequent accounts, this Napoleonic quote would undergo various changes until it became: &quot;Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.&quot;

==Historical views==
Napoleon did not succeed in defeating the Allied army as thoroughly as he wanted, but historians and enthusiasts alike recognize that the original plan provided a significant victory, comparable to other great tactical battles such as Cannae. Some historians suggest that Napoleon was so successful at Austerlitz that he lost touch with reality, and what used to be French foreign policy became a &quot;personal Napoleonic one&quot; after the battle. In French history, Austerlitz is acknowledged as an impressive military victory, and in the 19th century, when fascination with the First French Empire was at its height, the battle was revered by French authors such as Victor Hugo, who wrote of the &quot;sound of heavy cannons rolling towards Austerlitz&quot; echoing in the &quot;depths of [his] thoughts&quot;. In the 2005 bicentennial, however, controversy erupted when neither French President Jacques Chirac nor Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin attended any functions commemorating the battle. On the other hand, some residents of France&#x27;s overseas departments protested against what they viewed as the &quot;official commemoration of Napoleon&quot;, arguing that Austerlitz should not be celebrated since they believed that Napoleon committed genocide against colonial people.

After the battle, Tsar Alexander I blamed Kutuzov, the Commander-in-chief of the Allied Army. However, it is clear that Kutuzov planned to retreat farther to the rear, where the Allied Army had a sharp advantage in logistics. Had the Allied Army retreated further, they might have been reinforced by Archduke Charles&#x27;s troops from Italy, and the Prussians might have joined the Coalition against Napoleon. A French army at the end of its supply lines, in a place that had no food supplies, might have faced a very different ending from the one they achieved at the real battle of Austerlitz.

==Monuments and protection of the area==

In the years following the battle, many memorials were set up around the affected villages to commemorate both the individual episodes of the battle and the thousands of its victims. Since 1992, the area where the Battle of Austerlitz took place has been protected by law as a landscape monument zone. Its value lies in the historical peculiarities of the place, the historical connections of settlements, landscapes and terrain formations, and the overall landscape image. The area extends to 19 of today&#x27;s municipalities:

* Blažovice
* Holubice
* Hostěrádky-Rešov
* Jiříkovice
* Kobylnice
* Křenovice
* Podolí
* Ponětovice
* Prace
* Sivice
* Šlapanice
* Slavkov u Brna
* Sokolnice
* Telnice
* Tvarožná
* Újezd u Brna
* Velatice
* Žatčany
* Zbýšov
Near Prace is the Cairn of Peace Memorial, claimed to be the first peace memorial in Europe. It was designed and built in the Art Nouveau style by Josef Fanta in 1910–1912. World War I postponed the monument&#x27;s dedication until 1923. It is high, square, with four female statues symbolizing France, Austria, Russia and Moravia. Within is a chapel with an ossuary. A nearby small museum commemorates the battle. Every year, the events of the Battle of Austerlitz are commemorated in a ceremony.

Other memorials located in the monument zone include, among others:
* The Staré Vinohrady height near Zbýšov saw the bloody collision of the French and Russian guards. In 2005, the Monument to the Three Emperors has been erected here.
* &quot;Stará Pošta&quot; (&quot;Old Post&quot;) in Kovalovice is an original building from 1785, which now serves as a hotel and restaurant. On 28 November 1805, the French cavalry general Murat set up his headquarters here. On the day of the battle, the Russian general Bagration had his headquarters here. After the battle, Napoleon slept in this house and held preliminary negotiations about an armistice. A small museum commemorates these events.
* On in Tvarožná is a small white chapel. The hill was a mainstay of the French position and allowed the French artillery to dominate the northern portion of the battlefield. Below the hill, the yearly historical reenactments take place.
* On Žuráň Hill, where Napoleon was headquartered, a granite monument depicts the battlefield positions.
* Slavkov Castle, where an armistice was signed between Austria and France after the battle on 6 December 1805. There is a small historical museum and a multimedia presentation about the battle.

Several monuments to the battle can be found far beyond the battle area. A notable monument is the Pyramid of Austerlitz, built by French soldiers stationed there to commemorate the 1805 campaign near Utrecht in the Netherlands. In Paris, the 44-metre-high bronze Colonne Vendôme, a celebration of Napoleon, also stands on the Place Vendôme. The monument was initially called the Column of Austerlitz and, according to propaganda, was cast from the melted-down barrels of Allied guns from the Battle of Austerlitz. Several other sites and public buildings commemorate the encounter in Paris, such as Pont d&#x27;Austerlitz and nearby Gare d&#x27;Austerlitz. A scene from the battle is also depicted on the bas-relief of the eastern pillar of the Arc de Triomphe and Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel.

<text>Roman Tam Pak-sin (; 12 February 1945 – 18 October 2002), known professionally by his stage name Law Man (), was a Hong Kong singer. He is regarded as the &quot;Grand Godfather of Cantopop&quot;.

==Career==
Born in Baise, Guangxi, China, with family roots in Guiping, Guangxi, he moved to Guangzhou (Canton) in 1947 at the age of two. He later emigrated to Hong Kong in 1962 at the age of 17 because his mother fell ill and was only able to get better medical treatment in Hong Kong. He was poor and was only able to sleep with a sleeping bag and a radio on the floor of a banking building. His musical interests started from listening to the radio. After forming a short-lived band known as Roman and the Four Steps to emulate The Beatles and winning a talent contest in Japan, he became a contract singer under studios term at TVB. He briefly switched to Asia Television in the early 1990s. His stage name was actually a transliteration of his English name, Roman. 

During the 1990s, he accepted many budding singers as his students. Some of whom that became famous included Shirley Kwan, Joey Yung and Ekin Cheng. He had sung many well-known solos and duets for various TV series including &quot;Below the Lion Rock&quot;, and the famous 1983 TVB TV series &quot;The Legend of the Condor Heroes&quot; main theme duet with Jenny Tseng.

Tam was also known for bending and breaking gender norms, with a &quot;flamboyant&quot; on-stage persona. He was the first Hong Kong pop star to perform in drag and was featured in a magazine while posing in the nude. Although the latter was controversial at the time, Tam &quot;&#x27;got away with his on-stage flamboyance because of his off-stage discretion&#x27; and was accepted &#x27;in mainstream Chinese culture at a time when homosexuality was outlawed&#x27;&quot;. He never married and maintained a high degree of privacy in his personal life.

Tam officially retired in 1996, but continued to perform occasionally with other artists. 

On 19 October 2002, Tam died in Hong Kong at Queen Mary Hospital from liver cancer at the age of 57. Then-Secretary for Home Affairs Patrick Ho expressed his condolences.

<text>Arthur C. Olivier (born August 24, 1957) is an American politician who was the Libertarian candidate for Vice President of the United States in the 2000 U.S. presidential election as the running mate of presidential candidate Harry Browne.

Olivier later unsuccessfully ran in the 2024 Libertarian Party presidential primaries for the party&#x27;s presidential nomination. Olivier served as a councilman (1994–1997), mayor pro tempore (1997–1998) and mayor (1998–1999) of Bellflower, California, a Los Angeles suburb with 77,000 residents. During his five years on the Bellflower City Council (1994–1999), Olivier privatized the city&#x27;s tree trimming, crossing guards, street sweeping and building department. He eliminated the city&#x27;s lighting tax assessment and did not allow eminent domain to be exercised while on the council.

A graduate of Cerritos College with a degree in Design Technology, Olivier is a realtor with Cogburn Realty.

==Views==
During the campaign for vice president, Olivier advocated smaller government, &quot;We have to reduce the size of the federal government back to the size of its constitutional limits.&quot; Critical of the U.S. foreign policy of interventionism, he said he would like the government to return U.S. troops from abroad and make the Department of Defense get back to defending us, and not be a Department of Offense that bombs little countries.&quot; &quot;I don&#x27;t believe we should be the world&#x27;s policeman.&quot; He believes that U.S. foreign policy should be governed by an avoidance of “entangling alliances.&quot; &quot;The conflicts this country has entered into cause others to look badly upon America.&quot;

Olivier ran uncontested for governor in the 2006 Libertarian primary. He received 114,329 votes (1.3%) in his loss to incumbent Arnold Schwarzenegger in the general election. Olivier criticized Governor Schwarzenegger for passing a budget that was “30% larger than the one that got Governor Gray Davis recalled just three years ago.” Olivier&#x27;s main earned media was talk radio, advertising his opposition to illegal immigration. Olivier favored having the government build a wall on the border and cut off all tax-funded programs to illegal immigrants.

==Campaigns==
===2000 Libertarian vice presidential nominee===
On July 4, 2000, Olivier was chosen as the Libertarian Party&#x27;s vice presidential nominee for the 2000 Presidential Election. He beat Steve Kubby on the second ballot. He ran with Harry Browne. They got 5th place and 384,431 votes.

===2006 California gubernatorial campaign===
In the 2006 California gubernatorial election, Olivier ran against Arnold Schwarzenegger and Phil Angelides. He said he appeared on more talk radio shows than all other candidates combined. Olivier finished in 4th place. He got around 1% of the vote.

===2024 Libertarian presidential campaign===
Olivier ran for president in the 2024 Libertarian Party primaries. He earned 5 votes in the primaries.

In the first round of voting in the 2024 Libertarian National Convention, Olivier got 4 delegate votes. He was eliminated in the first round. The nomination eventually went to Chase Oliver.

==&quot;Operation Terror&quot;==
Olivier is supportive of the 9/11 truth movement. In 2012, he wrote and produced the thriller film &quot;Operation Terror&quot;, which depicted a fictionalized version of the September 11 attacks in New York City, 2001. The movie&#x27;s plot centered on a group of American government insiders that organized and assembled a group of people to attack the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. In writing &quot;Operation Terror&quot;, Olivier used dialogue taken from transcripts of the investigation by the 9/11 Commission and based the film&#x27;s characters on real-life players in the 9/11 attack.

The film premiered on September 11, 2012, in Los Angeles, and received the Honorable Mention Award at the International Film Festival for Peace, Inspiration and Equality and won the Genre Film: Thriller award at the International Movie Awards. The film&#x27;s director, Paul Cross, was also nominated for Best Director at the Fajr International Film Festival.

<doc id="118379" wikidata="Q958983" url="?curid=118379" title="Malaysian Indian Congress">
<text>The Malaysian Indian Congress (abbrev: MIC; )，formerly known as Malayan Indian Congress, is a Malaysian political party. It is one of the founding members of the coalition Barisan Nasional, previously known as the Alliance, which was in power from when the country achieved independence in 1957 until the elections in 2018. The party was among the first to fight for Malayan Independence and is one of the oldest parties in Malaysia.

The MIC was established in August 1946 to advocate for Indian independence from British colonial rule. After India gained its independence, MIC turned its focus to the struggle for the independence of Malaya (now Malaysia), which was achieved in 1957. It positioned itself to represent the Indian community in Malaya in the post-World War II development of the country. The MIC, the United Malays National Organisation and the Malaysian Chinese Association formed the National Alliance in 1954. The National Alliance incorporated additional parties and became the Barisan Nasional in 1973.

The MIC was once the largest party representing the Indian community, but has performed poorly in elections since 2008, losing out to Pakatan Harapan, which also represents majority of the Indian community.

In 2024, MIC expressed its support to a Unity Government led by Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim.

== History ==
=== John Thivy and Indian nationalism ===
John Thivy, the founder of the MIC, met Mahatma Gandhi at London while studying law. He was inspired by Gandhi&#x27;s ideology and Nehru&#x27;s vision and became determined to fight for Indian independence. He became actively involved in the Indian nationalist movement and returned to Malaya. He founded the Malaya Indian Congress (renamed Malaysian Indian Congress after the formation of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963) in August 1946, and was party president until 1947. The word &#x27;Congress&#x27; in the party&#x27;s name refers to the Indian National Congress, the party Mahatma Gandhi led to fight for Indian independence.

=== Baba Budh Singh Ji, Ramanathan, and opposition to the Malayan Union ===
After India gained independence in 1947, the MIC changed its focus and started to fight for the independence of Malaya. Baba Budh Singh Ji became president of MIC in 1947. After World War II, the British had established the Malayan Union, unifying the Malay Peninsula under a single government to simplify administration. Although a majority of the Indian community supported the Malayan Union, the MIC did not. The Malayan Union was dissolved in 1948 after widespread Malay protests and replaced with the Federation of Malaya. The MIC later joined the All-Malaya Council of Joint Action under Tun Tan Cheng Lock in opposition to the Federation of Malaya Agreement.

K. Ramanathan became president in 1950. By this time, the MIC was the leading party representing Indians in Malaya. Ramanathan advocated for the relaxation of the language proficiency test as a prerequisite for citizenship for Indians, and urged Indians to obtain federal citizenship.

=== K.L. Devaser and a focus on Malayan independence ===
The MIC&#x27;s fourth President, Kundan Lal Devaser, served from 1951 to 1955. It was during his period that MIC started to focus on the fight for Malayan independence.

Under Devaser, the MIC contested the 1952 Kuala Lumpur Municipal Elections in alliance with the Independence of Malaya Party, Dato&#x27; Onn bin Jaafar and other non-communal organisations. The election ended with a failure for MIC as their coalition was defeated by the Alliance Party. The defeat showed MIC that it stood a better chance of gaining influence by joining the Alliance. In 1954 the MIC joined the United Malays National Organisation and the Malayan Chinese Association in the Alliance, securing a place for Indians in the administration. The party&#x27;s broader membership was less enthusiastic than the MIC leadership about joining the Alliance but were willing to support the move if the party could secure concessions from the Alliance on inter-communal issues, particularly on education.

Devaser was primarily popular among the urban-based Indian elite, and lacked wider grassroots support. For the first eight years, MIC leaders were either of North Indian or Malayalee origin, a minority among Malayan Indians. The majority of Indians in Malaya at that time were Tamils, most of whom were labourers in plantations. Indian plantation workers experienced enforced segregation because of plantation compound housing. The plantation labour system also worked against the integration of Indian workers into society and perpetuated racial and occupational differentiation. Plantation workers were unable to acquire the skills required to move to better-paying jobs.

Migrant plantation workers were both marginalised and polarised in Malaya. Their wages were tied to rubber prices, falling when the rubber price fell, and were about 50c per day. Devaser came under heavy criticism from the Tamil media for not addressing the pressing issues facing the community. Some in the party felt that there was a need for a leader with a stronger relationship with the party&#x27;s grassroots. In March 1955, the local daily &quot;Tamil Murasu&quot; urged Tamils to boycott the MIC. This was followed by a call for change in MIC&#x27;s leadership, led by Tamil MIC leaders, and Devaser stepped down. The MIC then faced the challenge of reconciling the political aspirations of the middle class with the needs of the working class, who at the time comprised 84% of the plantation workforce.

=== V. T Sambanthan and becoming a Tamil party ===
In May 1955, Tun V. T. Sambanthan was elected as the fifth President of the Malayan Indian Congress. Sambanthan started a recruitment campaign among plantation workers, relying on the patronage of Hinduism in its popular South Indian form, increased use of the Tamil language, and encouraging Tamil cultural activities. He personally toured plantations and encouraged Tamils to join the MIC. This led to a fragmentation of the Indian community, with traditionalists and the lower middle class becoming prominent in the party while upper-class professionals and the intelligentsia moved away from it. Two paths to leadership emerged in the Indian community, via politics or via trade union activism, with very little interaction between them.

Under Sambanthan&#x27;s leadership, the MIC effectively became a Tamil party. Sambanthan served as president of the MIC until 1971 and was largely responsible for the transformation of the party to a conservative and traditionalist party emphasising Indian culture, religion and language. It was the weakest of the three main political parties, with the smallest electorate (7.4% in 1959) and had little support from the Indian community at large.

The Indian community was geographically dispersed and divided and comprised less than 25% of the population in any constituency. The MIC&#x27;s overriding concern was therefore to remain a partner in the Alliance and obtain whatever concessions it could from the dominant UMNO. This led the MIC to compromise on priorities such as the political and economic rights of workers.

Sambanthan sold approximately half of his father&#x27;s 2.4 km2 rubber estate and donated part of the money to the MIC. He was not uniformly popular but was able to gradually unite a party that had significant internal divides. During his presidency, in 1957, Malaysian independence was achieved. Sambanathan was involved in the negotiations with the British government&#x27;s Reid Commission to draw up the new Malayan constitution. In 1963 Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak merged with the Federation of Malaya to form the Federation of Malaysia, and the MIC renamed itself the Malaysian Indian Congress.

Sambanathan was forced to retire in favour of V. Manickavasagam in 1973 after a rebellion by five MIC leaders including Samy Vellu.

=== Manickavasagam and non-political ventures ===
Manickavasagam served as president of MIC from 1973 to 1978. During this period, Malaysia&#x27;s New Economic Policy was being developed, and the MIC convened two economic conferences in an unsuccessful effort to advocate for the interests of Indians.

It was during this period that the MIC, as member of the Alliance, became part of the Barisan Nasional. The party sponsored the Nesa Multipurpose Cooperative and the MIC Unit Trust as part of its programme for economic ventures. It also set up the MIC Education Fund for members&#x27; children and the Malaysian Indian Scholarship Fund for higher education as well as acquiring an Institute for training Indians in technical and trade skills.

Manickavasagam appointed several new representatives to leadership positions, including Subramaniam Sathasivam, Datuk K. Pathmanaban, a Harvard MBA holder, and several others. They were young, well-educated and ambitious but lacked grassroots experience. Subramaniam was hand-picked by Manickavasagam to become deputy president and succeed him, but the party elected Samy Vellu as Deputy President instead, by a narrow margin of 26 votes.

=== Samy Vellu and emphasis on education ===
Samy Vellu became MIC president in 1979 and served until 2010. Under his leadership, in 1984, the MIC founded the Maju Institute of Education Development (MIED) to offer educational opportunities and financial support to Indian students in Malaysia. Since its establishment, more than 10,000 students have obtained loans and scholarships totaling about RM60 million MIED fund as of 2013. In 2001, the MIC and MIED launched an AIMST University with the stated goal of helping Indians acquire professional training. Vellu was the founding chancellor of the university. By 2018, the university had achieved a score of 4 on the Malaysian Higher Education Institution&#x27;s 5-point rating scale. However, AIMST&#x27;s commitment to training Indian students has been questioned.

Vellu was succeeded by G. Palanivel who served from 2010 to 2014. Subramaniam was then elected, initially in an acting role, serving from 2014 to 2018. , the party is led by Vigneswaran Sanasee.

<text>In antiquity, publicans (Greek τελώνης &quot;telōnēs&quot; [singular]; Latin &quot;publicanus&quot; [singular]; &quot;publicani&quot; [plural]) were public contractors, who in their official capacity often supplied the Roman legions and military, managed the collection of port duties, and oversaw public building projects. In addition, they served as tax collectors for the Roman Republic (and later the Roman Empire), farming the taxes of the Roman provinces, and bidding on contracts (from the Senate in Rome) for the collection of various types of taxes. Importantly, this role as tax collectors was not emphasized until late into the history of the Republic (c. 1st century BC). The publicans were usually of the class of equites.

During the republican era, civil service, which was the size of modern middle-sized city governments, dealt with organising public policy for nearly thirty million people. The solution for the day-to-day operation of public administration was the extensive use of private contracting in the implementation of public policies. The earliest accounts of contracting describe contracts for feeding sacred geese, which were honoured for warning the citizens of Rome of approaching enemies, on the hill of Capitolium in Rome in 390 BC.

Private organisations, &quot;societas publicanorum&quot;, and their managers, the &quot;publicani&quot;, took care of most public duties, such as constructing public buildings, supplying equipment for the army, operating mines and, most importantly, collecting taxes. The societies participated in tenders for public duties. Those who offered the lowest price won construction deals, and those who guaranteed the highest amount of collected taxes for the Senate succeeded in tax collection tenders. The management structure of the societies represented a core-periphery structure with a relatively small permanent management structure and a large short-term operative work-force, which could be adjusted according to successes and losses in consecutive competitive tenders.

The &quot;societas publicanorum&quot; were probably the first type of limited liability shareholder-owned companies. A legal structure for limiting liability in purely private business activity did not exist at the time. To limit personal liability, which could lead to slavery and the confiscation of all personal property, early entrepreneurs invented the practice of common slave ownership, in which a jointly owned slave served as chief executive officer of the enterprise. As slaves were &#x27;things&#x27; responsible for only their own cost, they liberated the owners of their personal liabilities.

==History==
At the height of the Roman Republic&#x27;s era of provincial expansion (roughly 146 BC until the end of the Republic in 27 BC) the Roman tax farming system was very profitable for the &quot;publicani&quot;. The right to collect taxes for a particular region would be auctioned every few years for a value that (in theory) approximated the tax available for collection in that region. The payment to Rome was treated as a loan and the &quot;publicani&quot; would receive interest on their payment at the end of the collection period. In addition, any excess (over their bid) tax collected would be pure profit for the &quot;publicani&quot;. The principal risk to the &quot;publicani&quot; was that the tax collected would be less than the sum bid.

In the Roman Republic, the distinction between politics and business was clear-cut. Senators could not take part in the management of the &quot;societas publicanorum&quot; or other business activities, but they could be shareholders of the companies. Likewise, private contractors could not enter seats in the Senate. Consequently, the &quot;publicani&quot;, as the most influential group in the order of the knights, became part of the power-balancing mechanism of ancient Rome.

Tax farming deals in newly acquired eastern provinces in Asia Minor proved to be a highly lucrative source of income for the companies, which placed &quot;publicani&quot; in competitive positions with the appointed local governors of the provinces. Also, the exclusion of the &quot;publicani&quot; from the Senate opened up positions for them in the special courts, allowing them to weigh the limits and practices of government power.

The actions of the &quot;publicani&quot; were fiercely criticised. They were accused of insurance fraud in delivering goods during the Punic wars, of excessive greed when collecting taxes in the provinces, of exceptionally cruel conduct towards slave labour working in the mines, and of fraudulent practices in trying to get rid of unprofitable public contracts. However, surviving literary sources are mainly based on accounts of senators, who were in a competitive position with the &quot;publicani&quot;. Still, the overall operation of the private contractors seems to have supplied satisfactory results for the management of the Republic.

The degradation of the role of private contracting coincided with the beginning of the rule of the emperors, during which the oligarchic power of the Senate had to give way for the autocratic rule of the Caesars, and a more centralised public civil service system replaced private contractors in implementing the most important parts of public policy. However, the equestrian order, to which the &quot;publicani&quot; belonged, formed the backbone of the population from which civil servants were recruited. Throughout history, the &quot;publicani&quot;, or, more precisely, their local henchmen, were probably best known from their minor local tax collecting duties in Roman provinces during the imperial era 

By New Testament times, the provincial people came to see the publicans chiefly as tax collectors. It is in this sense that the term is used in Jesus&#x27; parable of the Pharisee and the Publican. However, their role as public contractors, especially as regards building projects, was still significant.
With the rise of a much larger Imperial bureaucracy, this task of the publicans, as well as their overall importance, declined precipitously. Evidence for the existence of publicans extends as far back as the 3rd century BC, although it is generally assumed that they existed at still earlier times in Roman history. Knowledge of a tentative &quot;terminus post quem&quot; is taken from the histories of the 1st century AD Imperial historian Livy.

<doc id="118385" wikidata="Q173714" url="?curid=118385" title="Max Euwe">
<text>Machgielis &quot;Max&quot; Euwe (; May 20, 1901 – November 26, 1981) was a Dutch chess player, mathematician, author, and chess administrator. He was the fifth player to become World Chess Champion, a title he held from 1935 until 1937. He served as President of FIDE, the World Chess Federation, from 1970 to 1978.

==Early years, education and professional career==
Euwe was born in the Watergraafsmeer, in Amsterdam. He studied mathematics at the University of Amsterdam under the founder of intuitionistic logic, L.E.J. Brouwer (who later became his friend and for whom he held a funeral oration), and earned his doctorate in 1926 under Roland Weitzenböck. He taught mathematics, first in Rotterdam, and later at a girls&#x27; Lyceum in Amsterdam. After World War II, Euwe became interested in computer programming and was appointed professor in this subject at the universities of Rotterdam and Tilburg, retiring from Tilburg University in 1971. He published a mathematical analysis of the game of chess from an intuitionistic point of view, in which he showed, using the Thue–Morse sequence, that the then-official rules (in 1929) did not exclude the possibility of infinite games.

==Early chess career==
Euwe played his first tournament at age 10, winning every game.
He won every Dutch chess championship that he entered from 1921 until 1952, and won the title again in 1955;  his 12 titles are still a record. The only other winners during this period were Salo Landau in 1936, when Euwe, then world champion, did not compete; and Jan Hein Donner in 1954. He became the world amateur chess champion in 1928, at The Hague, with a score of 12/15.

Euwe married in 1926, started a family soon afterwards, and could play competitive chess only during school vacations, so his opportunities for top-level international chess competition were limited. But he performed well in the few tournaments and matches for which he could find time, from the early 1920s to mid-1930s. He lost a training match to Alexander Alekhine in the Netherlands in December 1926 / January 1927, with 4½/10 (+2−3=5). The match was played to help Euwe prepare for a future encounter with José Raúl Capablanca, then world champion. Euwe lost both the first and second FIDE Championship matches to Efim Bogoljubow, held in the Netherlands in 1928 and 1928‒29 respectively, scoring 4½/10 in each match ((+2−3=5) in the first match, (+1−2=7) in the second match). He lost a match to Capablanca in Amsterdam in 1931 with 4/10 (+0−2=8). He won a match against Spielmann in Amsterdam in 1932, 3–1, played to help Euwe prepare for his upcoming match with Salo Flohr.

In 1932, Euwe drew a match with Flohr 8–8, and was equal second with Flohr, behind Alekhine, at a major tournament in Bern. According to Reuben Fine, these results established Euwe and Flohr as Alekhine&#x27;s most credible challengers.

At Zürich 1934, Euwe again finished equal second with Flohr, behind Alekhine, and he defeated Alekhine in their game.

==World Champion==

In 1933, Max Euwe challenged Alekhine to a championship match. Alekhine accepted the challenge for October 1935. Earlier that year, Dutch radio sports journalist Han Hollander asked Capablanca for his views on the forthcoming match. In the rare archival film footage where Capablanca and Euwe both speak, Capablanca replies: &quot;Dr. Alekhine&#x27;s game is 20% bluff. Dr. Euwe&#x27;s game is clear and straightforward. Dr. Euwe&#x27;s game—not so strong as Alekhine&#x27;s in some respects—is more evenly balanced.&quot; Then Euwe gives his assessment in Dutch, explaining that his feelings alternated from optimism to pessimism, but in the previous ten years, their score had been evenly matched at 7–7.

On December 15, 1935, after 30 games played in 13 different cities around the Netherlands over a period of 80 days, Euwe defeated Alekhine by 15½–14½, becoming the fifth World Chess Champion. Alekhine quickly went three games ahead, but Euwe managed to even out and eventually win the match. His title gave a huge boost to chess in the Netherlands. It was also the first world championship where the players had to help them with analysis during adjournments.

Euwe&#x27;s win was regarded as a major upset – he reportedly had believed that beating Alekhine was unlikely – and is sometimes attributed to Alekhine&#x27;s alcoholism. But Salo Flohr, who helped Euwe during the match, thought Alekhine&#x27;s over-confidence was more of a problem than alcohol; Alekhine himself said he would win easily. Former World Champions Vasily Smyslov, Boris Spassky, Anatoly Karpov, and Garry Kasparov later analysed the match and concluded that Euwe deserved to win and that the standard of play was worthy of a world championship. Former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik has said that Euwe won the 1935 match on merit and that the result was not affected by Alekhine&#x27;s drinking before or during the match.

Euwe&#x27;s performance in the great tournament of Nottingham 1936 (equal third, half a point behind Botvinnik and Capablanca, half a point ahead of Alekhine) indicated he was a worthy champion, even if he was not as dominant as the earlier champions. Reuben Fine wrote, &quot;In the two years before the return match, Euwe&#x27;s strength increased. Although he never enjoyed the supremacy over his rivals that his predecessors had, he had no superiors in this period.&quot;

Euwe lost the title to Alekhine in a rematch in 1937, also played in the Netherlands, by the lopsided margin of 15½–9½. Alekhine had given up alcohol and tobacco to prepare for the rematch, although he resumed drinking later. He returned to the sort of form he had shown from 1927 to 1934, when he dominated chess. The match was a real contest initially, but Euwe&#x27;s play collapsed near the end, and he lost four of the last five games. Fine, who was Euwe&#x27;s second, attributed the collapse to nervous tension, possibly aggravated by Euwe&#x27;s attempts to maintain a calm appearance.

The two world title matches against Alekhine represent the heart of Euwe&#x27;s career. Altogether, they played 86 competitive games, and Alekhine had a +28−20=38 lead. Many of Alekhine&#x27;s wins came early in their series; he was nine years older, and had more experience during that time. The rematch was also one-sided in Alekhine&#x27;s favour.

Until American born Bobby Fischer won the title in 1972, Euwe was the last World Chess champion not born in the Soviet Union.

==Later chess career==
Euwe finished equal fourth with Alekhine and Reshevsky in the AVRO tournament of 1938 in the Netherlands, which featured the world&#x27;s top eight players and was an attempt to decide who should challenge Alekhine for the world championship. Euwe also had a major organizational role in the event.

He played a match with Paul Keres in the Netherlands in 1939–40, losing 6½–7½.

After Alekhine&#x27;s death in 1946, Euwe was considered by some to have a moral right to the position of world champion, based at least partially on his clear second-place finish in the great tournament at Groningen in 1946, behind Mikhail Botvinnik. But Euwe consented to participate in a five-player tournament to select the new champion, the World Chess Championship 1948. At 47, Euwe was significantly older than the other players, and well past his best. He finished last. In 1950, FIDE granted Euwe the title of international grandmaster on its inaugural list. He took part in the Gijón international tournament in 1951, winning ahead of Pilnik and Rossolimo with a score of (+7 =2).

Euwe&#x27;s final major tournament was the double round robin Candidates&#x27; Tournament in Zürich, 1953, where he finished next to last. He was in the top half of the field after the first half of the tournament, but tired in the second half.

Euwe played for the Netherlands in seven Chess Olympiads from 1927 to 1962, a 35-year span, always on first board. He scored 10½/15 at London 1927, 9½/13 at Stockholm 1937 for a bronze medal, 8/12 at Dubrovnik 1950, 7½/13 at Amsterdam 1954, 8½/11 at Munich 1958 for a silver medal at age 57, 6½/16 at Leipzig 1960, and finally 4/7 at Varna 1962. His aggregate was 54½/87 for 62.6 percent.

In 1957, Euwe played a short match against 14-year-old future world champion Bobby Fischer, winning one game and drawing the other. His lifetime score against Fischer was one win, one loss, and one draw.

Euwe won a total of 102 first prizes in tournaments during his career, many of them local.

He became a computer science professor at Tilburg University in 1964.

==FIDE President==


From 1970 (at age 69) until 1978, Euwe was president of FIDE. As president, he usually did what he considered morally right rather than what was politically expedient. On several occasions this brought him into conflict with the USSR Chess Federation, which thought it had the right to dominate matters because it contributed a very large share of FIDE&#x27;s budget and Soviet players dominated the world rankings – in effect, they treated chess as an extension of the Cold War. These conflicts included:
* The events leading up to Bobby Fischer&#x27;s participation in the World Chess Championship 1972 match against Boris Spassky, which led to Fischer&#x27;s becoming the first non-Soviet champion since World War II. Euwe thought it important for the game&#x27;s health and reputation that Fischer have the opportunity to challenge for the title as soon as possible, and interpreted the rules very flexibly to enable Fischer to play in the 1970 Interzonal Tournament, which he won by a commanding score.
* The defection of Gennadi Sosonko in 1972. The Soviets demanded that Sosonko should be treated as an &quot;unperson&quot;, excluded from competitive chess, television or any other event that might be evidence of his defection. When Euwe refused, Soviet players boycotted the 1974 Wijk aan Zee tournament in the Netherlands because Sosonko competed.
* In 1976, world championship contender Viktor Korchnoi sought political asylum in the Netherlands. In a discussion a few days earlier, Euwe told Korchnoi: &quot;... of course you will retain all your rights ...&quot; and opposed Soviet efforts to prevent Korchnoi from challenging Anatoly Karpov&#x27;s title in 1978.
* Later in 1976, Euwe supported FIDE&#x27;s decision to hold the 1976 Chess Olympiad in Israel, which the Soviet Union did not recognize as a country, although the Soviets had won the 1964 Olympiad which had also been held in Israel. The Central Committee of Communist Party of the Soviet Union then started plotting to depose Euwe as president of FIDE.

Euwe lost some of his battles with the Soviets. According to Sosonko, in 1973, he accepted the Soviets&#x27; demand that Bent Larsen and Robert Hübner, the two strongest non-Soviet contenders (Fischer was now champion), should play in the Leningrad Interzonal tournament rather than the weaker one in Petrópolis. Larsen and Hübner were eliminated from the competition for the World Championship because Korchnoi and Karpov took the first two places at Leningrad.

Some commentators have also questioned whether Euwe did as much as he could have to prevent Fischer from forfeiting his world title in 1975.

It is also notable that in 1976, Rohini Khadilkar became the first female to compete in the Indian Men&#x27;s Championship. Her involvement in a male competition caused a furore that necessitated a successful appeal to the High Court and caused Euwe to rule that women could not be barred from national or international championships.

Despite the turbulence of the period, most assessments of Euwe&#x27;s performance as president of FIDE are sympathetic:
* Spassky, who had nominated Euwe for the job: &quot;He should certainly not have disqualified Fischer, and he should have been a little tougher with the Soviets ... you get a pile of complicated problems. But Euwe, of course, was the man for the job.&quot;
* Karpov said Euwe was a very good FIDE President, although he did commit one very serious error, rapidly extending the membership of FIDE to many small third-world countries. &quot;But neither he nor I could have foreseen what this would lead to. ... This led not only to the inflation of the grandmaster title, but also to the leadership vacuum at the head of the world of chess.&quot;
* Garry Kasparov was blunter: &quot;... unfortunately, he could not foresee the dangers flowing from a FIDE practically under Soviet dominance.&quot;
* Korchnoi regarded Euwe as the last honorable president of FIDE.
* Yuri Averbakh, who was a Soviet chess official as well as a grandmaster: &quot;... he always sought to understand the opposing point of view ... Such behavior was in sharp contrast to the behavior of the Soviet delegation leaders ... Max Euwe was, without a doubt, the best President FIDE ever had.&quot;

He died in 1981, age 80, of a heart attack. Revered around the chess world for his many contributions, he had travelled extensively while FIDE President, bringing many new members into the organization.

==Assessment of Euwe&#x27;s chess==
Euwe was noted for his logical approach and for his knowledge of openings, in which he made major contributions to chess theory. Paradoxically his two title matches with Alekhine were displays of tactical ferocity from both sides. But the comments by Kmoch and Alekhine (below) may explain this: Euwe &quot;strode confidently into some extraordinarily complex variations&quot; if he thought logic was on his side; and he was extremely good at calculating these variations. On the other hand, he &quot;often lacked the stamina to pull himself out of bad positions&quot;.

Alekhine was allegedly more frank in his Russian-language articles than in those he wrote in English, French or German. In his Russian articles he often described Euwe as lacking in originality and in the mental toughness required of a world champion. Sosonko thought Euwe&#x27;s modesty was a handicap in top-class chess (although Euwe was well aware of how much stronger he was than &quot;ordinary&quot; grandmasters).

Vladimir Kramnik also says Euwe anticipated Botvinnik&#x27;s emphasis on technical preparation, and Euwe was usually in good shape physically because he was a keen sportsman.

==Chess books by Euwe==
Euwe wrote over 70 chess books, far more than any other World Champion; some of the best-known are &quot;The Road to Chess Mastery&quot;, &quot;Judgement and Planning in Chess&quot;, &quot;The Logical Approach to Chess&quot;, and &quot;Strategy and Tactics in Chess.&quot; Former Soviet grandmaster Sosonko used Euwe and den Hertog&#x27;s 1927 &quot;Practische Schaaklessen&quot; as a textbook when teaching in the Leningrad House of Pioneers, and considers it &quot;one of the best chess books ever&quot;. &quot;Fischer World Champion&quot;, an account of the 1972 World Chess Championship match, co-authored by Euwe with Jan Timman, was written in 1972 but not published in English until 2002. Euwe&#x27;s book &quot;From My Games, 1920–1937&quot; was originally published in 1939 by Harcourt, Brace and Company, and was republished by Dover in 1975 (). He also did not forget children in his published writings. The year he won the world championship Chess he wrote a book named: (Dutch) Oom Jan leert zijn neefje schaken. ()

<text>The ¡Alarma! Chronicles is the name of a short story written by Terry Scott Taylor. 

The story was originally included in four albums released by the rock band Daniel Amos. Part one was included in their 1981 release, &quot;¡Alarma!&quot;, part two was included in their 1983 release, &quot;Doppelgänger&quot;, part three was included in their 1984 release, &quot;Vox Humana&quot; and the final part was included in their 1986 release, &quot;Fearful Symmetry&quot;. Each album musically and conceptually followed the themes of each part of the story.

The entire story was then released in its entirety in the 200 page hardcover book &quot;The ¡Alarma! Chronicles&quot; in 1999. That book also included three CDs with all of the music from the four previously mentioned albums, plus interviews with the band members, photos, essays and lyrics.

<text>The Battle of Navarino was a naval battle fought on 20 October (O.S. 8 October) 1827, during the Greek War of Independence (1821–1829), in Navarino Bay (modern Pylos), on the west coast of the Peloponnese peninsula, in the Ionian Sea. Allied forces from Britain, France, and Russia decisively defeated Ottoman and Egyptian forces which were trying to suppress the Greeks, thereby making Greek independence much more likely. An Ottoman armada which, in addition to Imperial warships, included squadrons from the &quot;eyalets&quot; of Egypt and Regency of Algiers and Tunis, was destroyed by an Allied force of British, French and Russian warships. It was the last major naval battle in history to be fought entirely with sailing ships, although most ships fought at anchor. The Allies&#x27; victory was achieved through superior firepower and gunnery.

The context of the three Great Powers&#x27; intervention in the Greek conflict was the Russian Empire&#x27;s long-running expansion at the expense of the decaying Ottoman Empire. Russia&#x27;s ambitions in the region were seen as a major geostrategic threat by the other European powers, which feared the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire and the establishment of Russian hegemony in the Eastern Mediterranean. The precipitating factor was support of elements in Orthodox Russia for Greek coreligionists, despite the opposition of Tsar Alexander in 1821 following the Greek rebellion against their Ottoman overlords. Similarly, despite official British interest in maintaining the Ottoman Empire, British public opinion strongly supported the Greeks. Fearing unilateral Russian action, Britain and France bound Russia, by treaty, to a joint intervention which aimed to secure Greek autonomy, whilst still preserving Ottoman territorial integrity as a check on Russia.

The Powers agreed, by the Treaty of London (1827), to force the Ottoman government to grant the Greeks autonomy within the empire and despatched naval squadrons to the Eastern Mediterranean to enforce their policy. The naval battle happened more by accident than by design as a result of a manoeuvre by the Allied commander-in-chief, Admiral Edward Codrington, aimed at coercing the Ottoman commander to obey Allied instructions. The sinking of the Ottomans&#x27; Mediterranean fleet saved the fledgling Greek Republic from collapse. But it required two more military interventions, by Russia in the form of the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–29 and a French expeditionary force to the Peloponnese to force the withdrawal of Ottoman forces from central and southern Greece, to finally secure Greek independence.
==Background==
The Ottoman Turks had conquered the Greek-controlled Byzantine empire during the 15th century, taking over its territory and its capital, Constantinople, and becoming its effective successor-state. In 1821, Greek nationalists revolted against the Ottomans, aiming to liberate ethnic Greeks from four centuries of Ottoman rule. Fighting raged for several years but by 1825, a stalemate had developed, with the Greeks unable to drive the Ottomans out of most of Greece, but the Ottomans were unable to crush the revolt definitively. However, in 1825, the Sultan succeeded in breaking the stalemate. He persuaded his powerful &quot;wali&quot; (viceroy) of Egypt, Muhammad Ali Pasha, who was technically his vassal but in practice autonomous, to deploy his Western-trained and equipped army and navy against the Greeks. In return, the Sultan promised to grant the rebel heartland, the Peloponnese, as a hereditary fief to Ali&#x27;s eldest son, Ibrahim. In February 1825, Ibrahim led an expeditionary force of 16,000 into the Peloponnese, and soon overran its western part; he failed, however, to take the eastern section, where the rebel government was based (at Nafplion).

The Greek revolutionaries remained defiant, and appointed experienced philhellenic British officers at the head of the army and fleet: Maj Sir Richard Church (land) and Lord Cochrane (sea). By this time however, the Greek provisional government&#x27;s land and sea forces were far inferior to those of the Ottomans and Egyptians: in 1827, Greek regular troops numbered less than 5,000, compared to 25,000 Ottomans in central Greece and 15,000 Egyptians in the Peloponnese. Also, the Greek government was virtually bankrupt. Many of the key fortresses on what little territory it controlled were in Ottoman hands. It seemed only a matter of time before the Greeks were forced to capitulate. At this critical juncture, the Greek cause was rescued by the decision of three Great Powers—Great Britain, France and Russia—to intervene jointly in the conflict.

==Diplomacy of the Great Powers==
From the inception of the Greek revolt until 1826, Anglo-Austrian diplomatic efforts were aimed at ensuring the non-intervention of the other great powers in the conflict. Their objective was to stall Russian military intervention in support of the Greeks, in order to give the Ottomans time to defeat the rebellion. However, the Ottomans proved unable to suppress the revolt during the long period of non-intervention secured by Anglo-Austrian diplomacy. By the time the Ottomans were making serious progress, the situation evolved in ways that would make non-interventionism untenable. In December 1825, the diplomatic landscape changed with the death of Tsar Alexander and the succession of his younger brother Nicholas I to the Russian throne. Nicholas was a more decisive and risk-taking character than his brother, as well as being far more nationalistic. The British government&#x27;s response to the evolving situation was to move towards joint intervention instead to limit Russian expansionism. Britain, France, and Russia signed the Treaty of London on 6 July 1827. The treaty called for an immediate armistice between the belligerents, in effect demanding a cessation of Ottoman military operations in Greece just when the Ottomans had victory in their grasp. It also offered Allied mediation in the negotiations on a final settlement that were to follow the armistice. The treaty called on the Ottomans to grant Greece a degree of autonomy, but envisaged it ultimately remaining under Ottoman suzerainty.

A secret clause in the agreement provided that if the Ottomans failed to accept the armistice within a month, each signatory Power would despatch a consul to Nafplion, the capital of the Hellenic Republic, thereby granting de facto recognition to the rebel government, something no Power had done hitherto. The same clause authorized the signatories in concert to instruct their naval commanders in the Mediterranean to &quot;take all measures that circumstances may suggest&quot; (i.e. including military action) to enforce the Allied demands, if the Ottomans failed to comply within the specified time limit. However, the clause added that Allied commanders should not take sides in the conflict. On 20 August 1827, the British naval commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, Vice-Admiral of the Blue Sir Edward Codrington, a veteran of 44 years at sea and a popular hero for his role in the Battle of Trafalgar, received his government&#x27;s instructions regarding enforcement of the treaty. Codrington could not have been a less suitable person for a task which required great tact. An impetuous fighting sailor, he entirely lacked diplomatic finesse, a quality he despised and derisively ascribed to his French counterpart, Henri de Rigny. He was also a sympathiser with the Greek cause, having subscribed to the London Philhellenic Committee.

==Order of battle==
Exact figures for the Ottoman/Egyptian fleet are difficult to establish. The figures given above are mainly those enclosed by Codrington in his report. These were obtained by one of his officers from the French secretary of the Ottoman fleet, a M. Letellier. However, another report by Letellier to the British ambassador to the Ottomans gives two more frigates and 20 fewer corvettes/brigs for a total of 60 warships. James assesses the Ottomans&#x27; &quot;effective&quot; strength as even lower: three ships of the line, 15 large frigates and 18 corvettes, totaling just 36 ships.

==Battle==
===Preliminary moves===

Vice-Admiral Codrington&#x27;s instructions were to impose and enforce an armistice on both sides and to interdict the flow of reinforcements and supplies from Asia Minor and Egypt to Ottoman forces in Greece. He was to use force only as a last resort.

On 29 August, the Ottomans formally rejected the Treaty of London&#x27;s stipulations, triggering the dispatch of Allied representatives to Nafplion. On 2 September, the Greek provisional government accepted the armistice. This freed Codrington to concentrate on coercing the Ottoman side.

Navarino Bay is a large natural harbour on the west coast of Messinia in the south-west Peloponnese. It is approximately 5 km long (between the headlands) and 3 km wide. The bay is sheltered from the open sea by a long, narrow islet, Sphacteria. This islet leaves two entrances to the bay. Because of a sandbank, the northern one is very narrow and shallow, 100 m wide and just 1 m deep in places, impassable to large boats. The southern one is much wider, 1,500 m, with an effective passage of 1,000 m width because of rocks. The southern entrance was at that time guarded by the Ottoman-held New Navarino fortress (Pylos). During the Greek insurgency, the bay was used by the Ottoman navy as its main operational base in the Peloponnese.

A large Ottoman–Egyptian fleet, which had been warned by the British and French to stay away from Greece, left Alexandria on 5 August 1827 and joined other Ottoman units at Navarino on 8 September. In response, Codrington arrived with his squadron off Navarino on 12 September. In talks on 25 September with Ibrahim Pasha and the Ottoman admiral, he extracted no explicit verbal promises that they would cease offensive operation. However, Codrington did get the pasha to commit a ceasefire until further instructions from the sultan were given. After these talks, Codrington withdrew to the nearby British-controlled Ionian island of Zante (Zakynthos), leaving a frigate off Navarino to keep watch on the Ottoman fleet.

But the Ottomans soon violated these understandings. Ibrahim was outraged that, while he was expected to observe a ceasefire, Codrington seemingly allowed the Greeks to continue military operations onn his vessels unhindered. The Greeks&#x27; British commanders were on the offensive at the entrance of the strategically vital Gulf of Corinth. Church&#x27;s army laid siege to the Ottoman-held port of Patras, while Cochrane organised a revolt behind Ottoman lines in Epirus. By sea, Frank Abney Hastings, a former British naval officer now serving with the Greeks, used a steam-powered warship, the , to launch a daring night raid on 29/30 September at Itea on the northern shore of the gulf, sinking nine Ottoman gunboats. The problem for Codrington was that these officers were acting on their own initiative, largely ignoring the often contradictory directives of their employer, the Greek provisional government. Recognising that appeals to the latter were ineffective, Codrington despatched aides directly to the British commanders to demand that they cease operations, but with little result.

After a vain protest to Codrington, Ibrahim decided to act. On 1 October, he despatched a naval squadron to reinforce the Patras garrison. It was intercepted by Codrington&#x27;s squadron at the entrance to the gulf, and forced to return to Navarino, shadowed by Codrington. Ibrahim tried again on the night of 3/4 October, this time leading the squadron in person. Using the darkness, he succeeded in slipping past the British picket ship unobserved, but was prevented from entering the gulf by a strong headwind. His squadron was obliged to anchor in the lee of Cape Pappas and wait out the storm. This gave Codrington time to catch up, and the British squadron, after a whole day of fighting the wind, arrived off Pappas on the evening of 4 October. Codrington fired a series of warning broadsides, and Ibrahim reluctantly decided to turn back.

In the meantime, Ibrahim&#x27;s scorched-earth policy continued unabated on land. The fires of burning villages and fields were clearly visible from Allied ships standing offshore. A British landing party reported that the population of Messinia was close to mass starvation.

On 13 October, Codrington was joined off Navarino by a French squadron under Rigny and a Russian squadron under L. van Heiden. On 18 October, after futile attempts to contact Ibrahim Pasha, Codrington, in conference with his Allied colleagues, took the fateful decision to enter Navarino Bay and anchor his ships face-to-face with the Ottoman/Egyptian fleet. It was decided that with winter approaching, it was impracticable to maintain an effective blockade of Navarino, and that in any event, the population of the Peloponnese had to be safeguarded. Although this was a highly provocative act, Codrington claimed that there was no intention to engage in battle, but only to make a show of force to induce the Ottomans to respect the armistice and to desist from atrocities against the civilian population.

===Strength of the two fleets===
====Allies====
The Allied navies at this time were still deploying essentially the same technology as during the Napoleonic Wars: sailing ships, unarmoured wooden hulls and muzzle-loading smoothbore cannon. The navies, especially the British one, had ignored the new technologies that were to transform them by the 1850s: steam propulsion, ironclad hulls, rifled guns and explosive shells. All these had been invented by 1827, but their development for naval warfare, let alone introduction, met dogged resistance from senior naval echelons. In the words of one scholar: &quot;The great admirals of the 18th century would have had no difficulty in taking over Codrington&#x27;s command at short notice.&quot;

However, the Royal Navy&#x27;s warships had seen some improvements. Ships with triple gun-decks such as Nelson&#x27;s famous had been phased out. Triple-deckers had been found to be too unstable and difficult to manoeuvre. The standard was a double-deck 74–84 ship of the line, based on the successful &quot;74&quot; French design. In addition, gun-calibres had been upgraded. The Napoleonic-era had been equipped with 32-pounders on the main gun-deck, 18-pounders on the upper deck and 9- and 12-pounders on the super-structures (quarterdeck and forecastle). In contrast, the guns were now all 24- or 32-pounders (plus a couple of massive 68-pounder carronades on the super-structures). Frigates were either double-deckers of 50–60 guns (known as large frigates) or single-deckers with 24–44 guns.

Most of the Allied ships, however, were still veteran Napoleonic-era warhorses (e.g. ). Codrington&#x27;s only &quot;Canopus&quot;-class was his flagship, (launched 1824), although &quot;Genoa&quot; (an impounded French &quot;74&quot;) was also post-Napoleonic (1816). In the French squadron, Rigny was so appalled by the state of the three ships of the line sent to him that he decided to keep his flag on the &quot;Sirène&quot;, a modern frigate.

====Ottomans====
Overall at Navarino, the Allies had 22 ships and 1,258 guns against the Ottomans&#x27; 78 ships with 2,180 guns (figures exclude smaller boats and fireships). But the numbers masked major Allied advantages in ship-types, gun-calibres and crew quality. As a result of these, Allied gun-crews could fire more powerful, more frequent and more accurate cannonades than their Ottoman counterparts.

The Allies had a substantial superiority in front-line combat vessels: 10 ships of the line to the Ottomans&#x27; three. This advantage was only partially offset by the Ottomans&#x27; seven double-deck frigates against one Allied vessel of this kind. The great majority of the Ottoman–Egyptian fleet were smaller vessels – 58 corvettes and brigs – which were of little use against the Allied heavyweights: they had much smaller firepower, and, their decks being lower, could easily be dismasted by raking fire. In addition, the Ottoman–Egyptians mainly deployed smaller-calibre guns than the Allies (often the guns discarded by the Allies when they upgraded their own calibres). Most of the Allied crews had gained extensive combat experience in the Napoleonic Wars, which had only ended 12 years previously, and were service professionals. In contrast, the Ottoman crews only had combat experience against the Greek revolutionary naval forces, which although gallant and effective, bore no resemblance to the navies of the Great Powers. In many cases, Ottoman crews practiced impressment to fill their ships&#x27; complements. Some Ottoman crew were even found, after the battle, to have been shackled at their posts (convicts, Greek prisoners or other involuntary recruits).

The Egyptian contingent, the largest and best-equipped of the Ottoman fleet at Navarino, had been trained by a team of French officers, under the overall direction of Capt J-M. Letellier. These officers acted as &quot;shadow-captains&quot; of the large Egyptian vessels, each advising the nominal Egyptian captain. The day before the battle, Rigny persuaded these officers to withdraw from the Egyptian fleet so as to avoid the possibility of fighting against their own navy (they moved to an Austrian brig that was in the bay, ostensibly neutral but in reality providing logistical support for Ottoman operations). Letellier himself was sick and also took no part. This deprived the Egyptians of experienced command.

For the Allies, probably the Ottomans&#x27; most dangerous weapon were their fireships. These had long been deployed to devastating effect by the Greek revolutionaries against the Ottomans, who had learnt how to use them through hard experience. Fireships were posted on the wings of the Ottoman formation, and could, if effectively deployed, wreak mayhem on Allied boats concentrated in enclosed waters, especially as Allied sailors had no experience of this kind of warfare. The danger was graphically demonstrated in the early phase of the battle, when the French ship of the line &quot;Scipion&quot; narrowly escaped being destroyed by a fireship.

The Ottomans possessed a shore battery on each side of the main entrance to the bay, in Navarino fort and on the southern tip of Sphacteria island. These could have seriously impeded Allied entry into the bay, but Codrington was clearly confident that the Ottomans would not start a shooting war. (Or, in an alternative interpretation, he hoped that they would, to give him an excuse to destroy the Ottoman fleet.)

===Strategies for battle===
Following an elaborate defensive plan proposed by Letellier, the Ottoman-Egyptian fleet was anchored in a horseshoe formation, in three lines, extending from Navarino fort to the southern tip of Sphacteria island, where the Ottoman shore battery lay. The front line consisted of the ships of the line and large frigates; the second line contained the remaining frigates and larger corvettes; the third consisted of the remaining smaller vessels. The idea was that the smaller vessels could fire through the gaps in the frontline, whilst being protected by the larger ships from Allied attack. On the ends of the horseshoe were stationed corvettes and fireships. The latter could be towed by boats into position covered by the smaller corvettes and shore batteries.

The Allied plan was to anchor in the free water inside the crescent. Codrington&#x27;s squadron would take up position facing the centre of the Ottoman line; the French and Russian squadrons would face the Ottoman left and right wings respectively. The French position in the line had been specifically determined so that they would face the Egyptian fleet, which had been trained by the French and might be reluctant to fight against Egypt&#x27;s closest European ally. In conventional naval doctrine, Codrington&#x27;s plan would have been regarded as an unacceptable risk, as it would have invited the enemy to try to surround the Allies. Furthermore, with the prevailing wind blowing from the SW, straight up the entrance, Codrington risked becoming trapped, unable to extricate his squadrons quickly if necessary. The adoption of this high-risk plan shows the total confidence of the Allied commanders in the tactical superiority of their vessels.

===Engagement===

At 1.30 p.m., on 20 October 1827, off the entrance to Navarino Bay, Codrington signalled to the Allied fleet: &quot;PREPARE FOR ACTION&quot; and Allied crews were ordered to stand to their guns. Gun-ports were left half-open, but Allied captains were under strict orders to open fire only if attacked. At 2.00 p.m., Allied warships, with Codrington in the lead in &quot;Asia&quot;, began filing into the bay through the southern entrance, proceeding in two lines, British followed by French to starboard (SE, closest to Navarino) and Russians to port abreast but slightly behind the French. There was no attempt to prevent their entry by the Ottoman shore batteries or their corvettes posted at the entrance, but Codrington received a launch carrying a message from Ibrahim Pasha. This stated that he had not given permission for the Allies to enter the bay, and demanded that they withdraw. Codrington dismissed Ibrahim&#x27;s objection, replying that he had come to give orders, not to take them. He warned that if the Ottomans opened fire, their fleet would be destroyed.

As his flagship dropped anchor in the middle of the Ottoman line, Codrington ordered a brass band to play on deck to emphasize his peaceful intentions. By 2.15 p.m., the three British ships of the line had dropped anchor in their allotted positions. Meanwhile, as the Allied vessels moved into position, along the Ottoman lines trumpets sounded action stations. Ottoman crews scrambled to meet the unexpected intrusion into their base.

At this point, at the entrance, fighting broke out. Codrington claimed that hostilities were started by the Ottomans. The outbreak, according to Allied sources, occurred in the following manner:

At the entrance to the bay, Capt Thomas Fellowes on the frigate &quot;Dartmouth&quot; had been detailed, with six smaller vessels (2 brigs and 4 schooners) to keep watch on the group of Ottoman corvettes and fireships on the left flank of the Ottoman line. As the Allied ships continued moving into the bay, Fellowes noticed that an Ottoman crew was preparing a fireship and sent a boat to instruct them to desist. The Ottomans fired on the boat and lighted the fireship. Fellowes sent a cutter to tow the fireship to a safe distance, but the Ottomans fired on the cutter, inflicting casualties. Fellowes opened musket fire on the fireship crew to cover his men. At this point the French flagship &quot;Sirène&quot;, which was just then entering the bay on the tail of the British-French line, opened fire with muskets to support &quot;Dartmouth&quot;. An Ottoman corvette then attacked &quot;Sirène&quot; with its guns. This chain reaction spread along the line, so that within a short time, there was general engagement.

The battle thus began before the Allies could complete their deployment. In fact, this proved to be a tactical advantage, as it meant some Allied ships were not yet at anchor and could therefore manoeuvre more swiftly. Nevertheless, most ships fought at anchor. There was naturally very little scope for manoeuvre, except to change the orientation of the ship by hauling on the springs on the anchor chains. With ships blasting each other at very close range, the encounter was mostly a matter of attrition, in which superior Allied firepower and gunnery were critical.

Combat action may be summarised as follows:

# The French ship &quot;Scipion&quot; (80 guns), behind Rigny&#x27;s &quot;Sirène&quot; (60), immediately came under intense attack, by a combination of Egyptian frigates on both sides, the shore batteries and a fireship. The latter was nearly fatal. The fireship jammed under &quot;Scipion&quot;″s bowsprit, the fore sails caught fire and the fire spread onto the upper gun-deck. Men flung themselves on the fire to prevent it spreading to the forward powder magazine, with inevitable horrendous burn injuries. Nevertheless, the gunners continued to fire on the attackers. &quot;Scipion&quot; was saved from destruction by her sister ship &quot;Trident&quot; (74), which succeeded in attaching a tow-line to the fireship and, with the assistance of &quot;Dartmouth&quot; and two other British boats, pulling it clear.
# Rigny&#x27;s &quot;Sirène&quot; fought a lengthy duel with the 64-gun frigate &quot;Ihsania&quot;, which finally blew up. &quot;Sirène&quot; suffered significant casualties and damage. &quot;Sirène&quot;, with the support of &quot;Trident&quot; and &quot;Scipion&quot;, then bombarded the fort of Navarino and eventually silenced its shore battery.
# The captain of French &quot;Breslaw&quot; (84), Captain Botherel de La Bretonnière, seeing that Rigny did not need further support, decided on his own initiative to break away from the French formation and move into the centre of the bay, at the junction of the British and Russian lines, to reinforce British &quot;Albion&quot; (74) and Russian &quot;Azov&quot; (80). Both were hard pressed. &quot;Albion&quot;, which had wrecked an Ottoman frigate as she anchored, was under fire from all three Ottoman ships of the line simultaneously. Fortunately for her, the enemy gunnery was inept. Even so, &quot;Breslaw&quot;″s intervention was later acknowledged by the captain of &quot;Albion&quot; as having saved his ship from annihilation. &quot;Breslaw&quot; then proceeded to play a leading role in the destruction of Ottoman admiral Tahir Pasha&#x27;s flagship, the &quot;Ghiuh Rewan&quot; (84), and at least four frigates.
# Codrington&#x27;s &quot;Asia&quot; (84) was anchored between Ottoman admiral Capitan Bey&#x27;s flagship, &quot;Fahti Bahri&quot; (74), and Egyptian Moharram Bey&#x27;s frigate &quot;Guerrière&quot; (60). Capitan Bey opened fire, but Moharram Bey sent word to Codrington that he was not going to attack. This enabled &quot;Asia&quot; to concentrate its fire on &quot;Fahti Bahri&quot;, which was in a poor condition and inadequately manned. &quot;Asia&quot;″s deadly fire shortly disabled her. Codrington then sent an interpreter, a Greek, P. Mikelis, to parley with Moharram Bey; but Mikelis was shot dead as he went aboard. &quot;Guerrière&quot; then opened fire, but was reduced to a burning wreck within 20 minutes by crushing broadsides from &quot;Asia&quot; and &quot;Azov&quot;. However, &quot;Asia&quot; suffered severe casualties and damage due to a concentration of heavy fire from smaller Ottoman boats in the second and third lines of the Ottoman formation: as Letellier had planned, these boats fired through the gaps in the front line. Codrington also believed that &quot;Asia&quot; had taken serious hits by mistake from sister &quot;Genoa&quot;.
# The Russians under Van Heiden were the last to take up station, as was planned. Their position, on the right end of the Ottoman crescent, was the most exposed. The fighting in this sector was even more intense than elsewhere. &quot;Azov&quot; sank or disabled three large frigates and a corvette, but herself took 153 hits, several below the waterline.
# The British frigates &quot;Armide&quot; and &quot;Talbot&quot; initially had to face the frigates on the Ottoman right wing and the island shore battery unsupported, as the other two frigates were away and arrived later. They were saved from annihilation by the arrival of the Russian frigates.
# The smaller British and French vessels (brigs and the schooners &quot;Alcyone&quot; and &quot;Daphné&quot;), under the overall direction of frigate &quot;Dartmouth&quot;, had been allotted the vital task of preventing fireship attacks. Their success was complete: apart from the initial fireship attack on &quot;Scipion&quot;, not a single fireship struck a target during the battle. A number of the smaller vessels greatly distinguished themselves, suffering casualties as great, in proportion, as the ships of the line.
By about 4 p.m., all three Ottoman ships of the line and most of the large frigates of the first line had been despatched. This left the mass of smaller vessels in the second and third lines at the mercy of the Allied ships of the line, all of which were still operational. During the ensuing massacre, Codrington tried twice to order a ceasefire, but his signals were either invisible because of the thick smoke or ignored in the heat of the battle. Within the following two hours, virtually the entire Ottoman fleet was destroyed, despite the signal bravery of the Ottoman crews, which was praised by Codrington himself in his despatches. Three quarters were sunk: many of them, dismasted but still afloat and reparable, were blown up or set on fire by their own crews to prevent them falling into Allied hands.
This contributed to the horrendous Ottoman and Egyptian casualty figures, as many men were trapped in burning or exploding vessels. Some, as mentioned, were shackled to their posts. Ottoman casualties given to Codrington by Letellier were approx. 3,000 killed, 1,109 wounded, although Codrington claimed the reverse was more likely. Of the entire Ottoman-Egyptian armada of 78 vessels, just eight remained seaworthy: one dismasted ship of the line, two frigates, and five corvettes.

Allied casualties were given by Codrington as 181 killed, 480 wounded (including Codrington&#x27;s youngest son, midshipman H. Codrington, serving on &quot;Asia&quot; under his father, who was badly injured but made a full recovery). Several Allied ships were severely damaged: the Russian ships &quot;Azov&quot;, &quot;Gangut&quot; and &quot;Iezekiil&quot; were disabled. The three British ships of the line had to be sent back to the United Kingdom for repairs. According to one source, despite the rough handling all the ships of the line had endured and the danger from exploding Ottoman vessels, not a single Allied vessel was sunk.

As the guns fell silent at dusk in Navarino Bay, news of the outcome raced over the Peloponnese and to the rest of Greece. In village after village, church bells started a continuous peal in the night. People rushed into village squares, to be greeted by the news that the Ottoman Sultan and his hated vassal Ibrahim Pasha no longer possessed a Mediterranean fleet. In a maritime country like Greece, the implication was evident—the fledgling Greek state was saved. Wild rejoicing broke out, and lasted through the night and for days after. Huge bonfires were lit on the mountaintops of the Peloponnese and Mount Parnassos in central Greece. Celebrations swept even the occupied regions, which the demoralised Ottoman garrisons made little effort to prevent.

==Aftermath==

Despite the celebrations, the Sultan still disposed of a total of around 40,000 troops in central and southern Greece, entrenched in powerful fortresses. The final liberation of Greece was still far off, unless the Ottomans could be induced to accept the Treaty of London.

Russia&#x27;s long-expected declaration of war on the Ottomans occurred in April 1828, starting the 11th Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829). A Russian army of 100,000 men swept aside the Ottoman forces in the Romanian Principalities, crossed the Danube, and laid siege to Silistra, Varna and Shumla, the key Ottoman-held fortresses in Rumelia (Bulgaria).

In August 1828, Ali agreed to the withdrawal of his forces from the Peloponnese. Ibrahim initially refused to comply with his father&#x27;s evacuation orders, but gave way shortly after the French troops landed in Navarino Bay at the end of August, to a jubilant reception by the Greeks, to begin their Morea expedition. The Egyptians finally left in October 1828, a year after the naval battle. The French proceeded to clear the remaining Ottoman garrisons in the Peloponnese, which offered only token resistance, by the end of 1828. In the subsequent months, Greek forces regained control of central Greece in a lightning campaign.
In September 1829, with the Russian army camped just 40 miles from his palace, the Ottoman Sultan was forced to capitulate. By the Treaty of Adrianople, he conceded a long list of Russian demands, one of which was acceptance of Greek autonomy as defined in the Treaty of London. However, the Sultan&#x27;s acceptance came too late to save Ottoman sovereignty over Greece. Buoyed by the Ottoman disasters on land and sea, and their own military successes, the Greeks refused to accept anything less than full independence. Finally, at the London Protocol of 1830, the Allies dropped their policy of Ottoman suzerainty and accepted Greek independence. Later that year, the Sultan was forced by the Allied powers to sign the Treaty of Constantinople (1832), formally recognizing the new Kingdom of Greece as an independent state.

==Codrington controversy==
In the aftermath of Navarino, Codrington pressed for an Egyptian withdrawal from the Peloponnese, but it took a year to achieve it. The news of Navarino made Codrington a hero twice over in the eyes of the general British public. But in Whitehall, senior naval and diplomatic echelons were appalled by the outcome of his campaign. It was considered that Codrington had grossly exceeded his instructions by provoking a showdown with the Ottoman fleet, and that his actions had gravely compromised the Ottoman ability to resist Russian encroachment. At a social event, King George IV was reported as referring to the battle as &quot;this untoward [&quot;i.e.&quot;, undesirable] event&quot;. Codrington&#x27;s political situation in London became even more precarious in January 1828, when Wellington became Prime Minister. The coincident launch of Tsar Nicholas&#x27;s war on the Ottomans realised the worst fears of British policy-makers and deepened their anger at Codrington.

Initially, official disapproval of Codrington had to be restrained because of the admiral&#x27;s huge popularity with the public. The Admiralty&#x27;s revenge took petty form, such as its refusal, despite repeated requests by Codrington, to pay his crews their traditional prize money from the sale of captured Ottoman treasure and goods. Meanwhile, Wellington was biding his time until he felt it was politically safe to remove Codrington from the Mediterranean theatre. Finally, in June 1828, the Admiralty announced that Codrington was being relieved of his command (although he remained in acting-command until his replacement arrived in August). Although the King felt obliged by public opinion to grant Codrington the high honour of the Grand Cross of the Bath, the Admiralty&#x27;s failure to give him another operational command in his remaining decade of service was eloquent testimony to his fall from favour.

Codrington spent much time in his later years defending his actions in Greece. His enemies accused him of deliberately plotting the destruction of the Ottoman fleet because of his Hellenophile sympathies, a charge that Codrington vehemently denied. The issue turned on whether he knew that his move into Navarino Bay would result in a battle. The evidence is mixed. On the one hand, there are Codrington&#x27;s clear orders to his captains to engage only if attacked. On the other, is Codrington&#x27;s private correspondence, notably to his sister, which suggests that he regarded a military showdown as inevitable.

==Commemoration of the battle==

There are a number of memorials to the battle around Navarino Bay. The main square of Pylos, Three Admirals&#x27; Square (), has as its centrepiece a three-sided marble monument, with profiles of Codrington, Van Heiden, and Rigny on the three sides.

Memorials to the dead of the three allies are to be found on the islands in the bay: Helonaki islet (British), Pylos islet (French), and Sphacteria island (Russian). The Russian memorial is the most impressive, consisting of a small wooden chapel in the Russian Orthodox style. Additionally, there is a memorial to the philhellene Santarosa, who was killed in an earlier battle, on the shore of Sphacteria.

The battle is commemorated each year on 20 October by all-day celebrations in Three Admirals&#x27; Square in Pylos, hosted by the Mayor of Pylos. The Russian, French and British governments send representatives to the ceremonies, and in the case of the Russians, a warship and its crew. It was the source of the name for the Russian corvette &quot;Navarin&quot;, the Russian battleship &quot;Navarin&quot;, and the French ship of the line &quot;Navarin&quot;.

Some bronze from the sunken Ottoman ships was bought by Anton Samassa in Trieste and was in 1834 used for the main bell of St. Judoc&#x27;s Church in Sveti Jošt near Kranj, Carniola (now Slovenia). It bears an inscription by the Slovene Romantic poet France Prešeren: &quot;My bronze was found at the bottom of the sea, when the kingdom of Turkey was ended in Helade by Navarino. It was bought by a pilgrim; cast into a bell by Samassa, now I announce God&#x27;s honour from St. Jodocus&#x27;s embrasures.&quot;

<doc id="118393" wikidata="Q14946576" url="?curid=118393" title="Vernier scale">
<text>A vernier scale ( ), named after Pierre Vernier, is a visual aid to take an accurate measurement reading between two graduation markings on a linear scale by using mechanical interpolation, thereby increasing resolution and reducing measurement uncertainty by using vernier acuity to reduce human estimation error. It may be found on many types of instrument measuring length or measuring angles, but in particular on a vernier caliper, which measures lengths of human-scale objects (including internal and external diameters). 

The vernier is a subsidiary scale replacing a single measured-value pointer, and has for instance ten divisions equal in distance to nine divisions on the main scale. The interpolated reading is obtained by observing which of the vernier scale graduations is coincident with a graduation on the main scale, which is easier to perceive than visual estimation between two points. Such an arrangement can go to a higher resolution by using a higher scale ratio, known as the vernier constant. A vernier may be used on circular or straight scales where a simple linear mechanism is adequate. Examples are calipers and micrometers to measure to fine tolerances, on sextants for navigation, on theodolites in surveying, and generally on scientific instruments.
The Vernier principle of interpolation is also used for electronic displacement sensors such as absolute encoders to measure linear or rotational movement, as part of an electronic measuring system.

==History==

The first caliper with a secondary scale, which contributed extra precision, was invented in 1631 by French mathematician Pierre Vernier (1580–1637). Its use was described in detail in English in &quot;Navigatio Britannica&quot; (1750) by mathematician and historian John Barrow. While calipers are the most typical use of vernier scales today, they were originally developed for angle-measuring instruments such as astronomical quadrants.

In some languages, the vernier scale is called a &quot;nonius&quot; after Portuguese mathematician and cosmographer Pedro Nunes (Latin &quot;Petrus Nonius&quot;, 1502–1578). In English, this term was used until the end of the 18th century. &quot;Nonius&quot; now refers to an earlier instrument that Nunes developed.

The name &quot;vernier&quot; was popularised by the French astronomer Jérôme Lalande (1732–1807) through his &quot;Traité d&#x27;astronomie&quot; (2 vols) (1764).

==Functioning==

The use of the vernier scale is shown on a vernier caliper which measures the internal and the external diameters of an object.

The vernier scale is constructed so that it is spaced at a constant fraction of the fixed main scale. So for a vernier with a constant of 0.1, each mark on the vernier is spaced 9/10 of those on the main scale. If you put the two scales together with zero points aligned, the first mark on the vernier scale is 1/10 short of the first main scale mark, the second is 2/10 short, and so on up to the ninth mark, which is misaligned by 9/10. Only when a full ten marks are counted, is there alignment, because the tenth mark is 10/10—a whole main scale unit—short, and therefore aligns with the ninth mark on the main scale. (In simple words, each , so each decrement of length 0.1 adds 10 times to make one MSD only in 9 divisions of vernier scale division).

Now if you move the vernier by a small amount, say, 1/10 of its fixed main scale, the only pair of marks that come into alignment are the first pair, since these were the only ones originally misaligned by 1/10. If we move it 2/10, the second pair aligns, since these are the only ones originally misaligned by that amount. If we move it 5/10, the fifth pair aligns—and so on. For any movement, only one pair of marks aligns and that pair shows the value between the marks on the fixed scale.

===Least count or vernier constant===
The difference between the value of one main scale division and the value of one vernier scale division is known as the least count of the vernier, also known as the vernier constant. Let the measure of the smallest main-scale reading, that is the distance between two consecutive graduations (also called its &quot;pitch&quot;) be &quot;S&quot;, and the distance between two consecutive vernier scale graduations be &quot;V&quot;, such that the length of (&quot;n&quot; − 1) main-scale divisions is equal to &quot;n&quot; vernier-scale divisions. Then

: the length of (&quot;n&quot; − 1) main-scale divisions = the length of &quot;n&quot; vernier-scale division, or
: (&quot;n&quot; − 1)&quot;S&quot; = &quot;nV&quot;, or
: &quot;nS&quot; − &quot;S&quot; = &quot;nV&quot;. &quot;Least count&quot; &quot;(S-V) = S/n&quot;

===Vernier acuity===
Vernier scales work so well because most people are especially good at detecting which of the lines is aligned and misaligned, and that ability gets better with practice, in fact far exceeding the optical capability of the eye. This ability to detect alignment is called &quot;vernier acuity&quot;. Historically, none of the alternative technologies exploited this or any other hyperacuity, giving the vernier scale an advantage over its competitors.

===Zero error===
Zero error is defined as the condition where a measuring instrument registers a nonzero value at the zero position. In case of vernier calipers it occurs when a zero on main scale does not coincide with a zero on vernier scale. The zero error may be of two types: when the scale is towards numbers greater than zero, it is positive; otherwise it is negative. The method to use a vernier scale or caliper with zero error is to use the formula
: actual reading = main scale + vernier scale − (zero error).

Zero error may arise due to knocks or other damage which causes the 0.00 mm marks to be misaligned when the jaws are perfectly closed or just touching each other.


Positive zero error refers to the case when the jaws of the vernier caliper are just closed and the reading is a positive reading away from the actual reading of 0.00mm. If the reading is 0.10mm, the zero error is referred to as +0.10 mm.

Negative zero error refers to the case when the jaws of the vernier caliper are just closed and the reading is a negative reading away from the actual reading of 0.00mm. If the reading is 0.08mm, the zero error is referred to as −0.08mm.

If positive, the error is subtracted from the mean reading the instrument reads. Thus if the instrument reads 4.39 cm and the error is +0.05, the actual length will be 4.39 − 0.05 = 4.34.
If negative, the error is added to the mean reading the instrument reads. Thus if the instrument reads 4.39 cm and as above the error is −0.05 cm, the actual length will be 4.39 + 0.05 = 4.44.
(Considering that, the quantity is called zero correction which should always be added algebraically to the observed reading to the correct value.)

: Zero error (ZE) = ±n × least count (LC)

===Direct and retrograde verniers===
&quot;Direct verniers&quot; are the most common. The indicating scale is constructed so that when its zero point coincides with the start of the data scale, its graduations are at a slightly smaller spacing than those on the data scale and so none but the last graduation coincide with any graduations on the data scale. &quot;N&quot; graduations of the indicating scale cover &quot;N&quot; − 1 graduations of the data scale.

&quot;Retrograde verniers&quot; are found on some devices, including surveying instruments. A retrograde vernier is similar to the direct vernier, except its graduations are at a slightly larger spacing than on the main scale. &quot;N&quot; graduations of the indicating scale cover &quot;N&quot; + 1 graduations of the data scale. The retrograde vernier also extends backwards along the data scale.

Direct and retrograde verniers are read in the same manner.

==Recent uses==
This section includes references to techniques which use the Vernier principle to make fine-resolution measurements.

Vernier spectroscopy is a type of cavity-enhanced laser absorption spectroscopy that is especially sensitive to trace gases. The method uses a frequency-comb laser combined with a high-finesse optical cavity to produce an absorption spectrum in a highly parallel manner. The method is also capable of detecting trace gases in very low concentration due to the enhancement effect of the optical resonator on the effective optical path length.
