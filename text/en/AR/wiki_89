<text>Highland Park is a borough in Middlesex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, in the New York City metropolitan area. The borough is located on the northern banks of the Raritan River, in the Raritan Valley region. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 15,072, an increase of 1,090 (+7.8%) from the 2010 census count of 13,982, which in turn reflected a decline of 17 (−0.1%) from the 13,999 counted in the 2000 census.

Highland Park was formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 15, 1905, when it broke away from what was then known as Raritan Township (present-day Edison). The borough was named for its location above the Raritan River.

==History==
The earliest settlers of the land that would become Highland Park were the Lenape Native Americans, who hunted in the hills along the Raritan River and had trails that crisscrossed the area, providing a link between the Delaware River and Hudson River areas. In 1685, John Inian bought land on both shores of the Raritan River and built two new landings downstream from the Assunpink Trail&#x27;s fording place, which was later developed as Raritan Landing. He established a ferry service and the main road then was redirected to lead straight to the ferry landing. This river crossing was run by generations of different owners and a ferry house tavern operated for many years in the 18th century. A toll bridge replaced the ferry in 1795. The wood plank Albany Street Bridge was dismantled in 1848 and reconstructed in 1853. The present day seven-span stone arch road bridge was built in 1892 and stretches across the Raritan River to New Brunswick. It became the Lincoln Highway Bridge in 1914 and was widened in 1925.

In the late 17th century, Henry Greenland became one of the area&#x27;s first European settlers; he owned nearly of land on the Mill Brook section of the Assunpink Trail, where he operated an inn for travelers. Others early settlers included Captain Francis Drake and other members of the Drake family, relatives of the famous explorer. In the early 18th century, a few wealthy Europeans including the Van Horns and Merrills settled on large tracts of land establishing an isolated farmstead pattern of development that would continue for the next 150 years.

The Reverend John Henry Livingston of the famous Livingston family, newly chosen head of Queen&#x27;s College (now Rutgers University), purchased a plot of land in 1809, which would hereafter be known as the Livingston Manor. A gracious Greek Revival house built around 1843 by Robert and Louisa Livingston stands on this property, which remains Highland Park&#x27;s most prominent historic house. The Livingston Homestead, which is listed in the National Register of Historic Places, was owned by the Waldron family throughout most of the 20th century.

In the early 19th century, both the Delaware &amp; Raritan Canal and a railroad were constructed largely to serve the commercial center of New Brunswick across the river. In 1836, the New Jersey Railroad and Transportation Company built a rail line that terminated on the Highland Park side of the Raritan River and established a station named &quot;East New Brunswick.&quot; The Camden and Amboy Railroad built a wood, double-deck bridge which eliminated the station stop in 1838. It was destroyed by a suspicious fire in 1878. A replacement iron truss bridge was constructed on the existing enlarged stone piers, which in turn was replaced in 1902 by the current twelve-span stone arch bridge encased in concrete in the 1940s.

Despite the canal and the railroad, Highland Park&#x27;s land continued to be used for agriculture. Residential development slowly began 30 years later, with several stately houses constructed on Adelaide Avenue and more modest houses constructed on Cedar, First, and Second Avenues and Magnolia, Benner, and Johnson Streets. In the 1870s, the small hamlet became better known as &quot;Highland Park&quot;, a name derived from the suburban housing development although the area adjacent to the railroad tracks continued to be called &quot;East New Brunswick.&quot;
1870 was also the year in which Highland Park was annexed to the newly formed township now called Edison, but at the time called Raritan Township.

Highland Park had its own school district and on March 15, 1905, the Borough of Highland Park was formed. Highland Park&#x27;s drive for independence from Raritan Township arose over the issue of public schooling. Residents wanted an independent school system and there was a related dispute over school taxes. The fire department, which had formed in 1899, also wanted more local control over their affairs. The 1905 New Jersey census counted 147 dwellings in the new borough. In 1918, Robert Wood Johnson II was appointed to the Highland Park Council and became mayor in 1920. His summer house and estate was located on River Road, just north of the railroad tracks.

Since its establishment as a borough, Highland Park&#x27;s lands have been parceled into ever-smaller suburban residential plots. Planned developments included Watson Whittlesey&#x27;s Livingston Manor development begun in 1906; the Viehmann Tract, also on the north side; Riverview Terrace on the south side; Raritan Park Terrace in the triangle between Raritan and Woodbridge Avenues; and East New Brunswick Heights in the Orchard Heights neighborhood. It has taken years of continuously constructing houses and apartment buildings to create the largely residential borough.

Highland Park&#x27;s industrial development in the 19th and 20th centuries included such businesses as a brewery, Johnson &amp; Johnson, The John Waldron Machine Company, Turner Tubes, and the Janeway &amp; Carpender Wallpaper factory. The borough is the birthplace of the Band-Aid. and Flako Products packaged mixes for baked goods. However, the industrial nature of the borough completely declined by the 1960s. The commercial zones along both Raritan and Woodbridge Avenues continue to thrive with &quot;mom &amp; pop&quot; shops, many that have lasted for generations.

Throughout the 20th century, Highland Park&#x27;s religious institutions, educational facilities, and municipal governance have kept pace with the growth of the borough. The trends of local autonomy and control that shaped Highland Park in the past continue to this day.

In 2012, Highland Park became the first municipality in the state to contract a home performance company to help residents consume less energy. The program is a one-of-a-kind program that can offer up to a 30% energy savings for homeowners.

In 2016, Highland Park became the state&#x27;s first registered HeartSafe community.

===Livingston Manor Historic District===


Livingston Manor was a subdivision built upon the lands surrounding the Livingston Homestead. This subdivision was the brainchild of Watson Whittlesey (1863–1914), a real estate developer born in Rochester, New York. Whittlesey was more than a typical land speculator; he was a community builder, which was noted by his residency in various Livingston Manor houses from 1906 to 1914, and by his active involvement in the municipal affairs of Highland Park. Instead of auctioning lots like his 19th century predecessors, Whittlesey sold subdivided lots with either a house completely built by his company or with the promise of providing a company-constructed house similar to those previously constructed.

The suburban development grew between 1906 and 1925, when Whittlesey&#x27;s company, the Livingston Manor Corporation and its successor, the Highland Park Building Company, constructed single-family houses from plans produced by a select group of architects. While a variety of building types and styles are present on each block, the buildings in the district are distinguished by the use of specific building plans found nowhere else in Highland Park and by the embellishments that are typical of the Craftsman philosophy, which emphasized the value of the labor of skilled artisans who showed pride in their abilities.

In the first years of this development, the houses were constructed one entire block at a time beginning with the southeast side of Grant Avenue between Lawrence Avenue and North Second Avenue. The next block to be developed was the northwest side of Lincoln Avenue between Lawrence Avenue and North Second Avenue. Six stucco bungalows were then constructed on the southern side of Lawrence east of Lincoln Avenue. As the housing development grew in popularity, houses were constructed less systematically by block, and more often on lots that individual homeowners selected from the remaining available properties. Whittlesey used plans from architects George Edward Krug and Francis George Hasselman, as well as plans generated by several local architects including John Arthur Blish and William Boylan. Several of Livingston Manor&#x27;s Tudor Revival houses were designed by Highland Park&#x27;s eminent architect Alexander Merchant. Merchant created numerous buildings in New Brunswick and Highland Park (see list below). Like other early-20th century architects, he was active during the period of early American modernism, but, having trained at the firm of Carrère and Hastings, Merchant developed and maintained a classical design vocabulary.

Many workers in the building trades, such as Harvey E. Dodge, the carpenter Frederick Nietscke and the contractor Harold Richard Segoine, have also been identified as Livingston Manor Corporation employees as well as Livingston Manor residents. Whittlesey, with his wife Anna, also lived in several Livingston Manor houses, including the Spanish Colonial style house at 35 Harrison Avenue designed specifically for them.

On December 1, 1906, the first deeds were transferred to two individual homeowners. Many prominent New Brunswick and Highland Park residents bought houses in this new neighborhood. They included Rutgers College professors, school teachers, bank employees, factory owners, and store owners. Census data show that most of the women were housewives and mothers. There were many extended families. Some families took in boarders and several households included live-in servants. Sixty-two houses had been constructed in Livingston Manor by 1910.

In 1912, Watson Whittlesey hired a sales agent, John F. Green, and began selling bungalow lots. These properties were smaller and less expensive, and a set of plans for a bungalow was given to any purchaser. By 1913, 120 houses had been constructed in Livingston Manor.

Dubbed &quot;Lord of the Manor&quot;, Whittlesey created a neighborhood spirit by giving receptions for the residents, by providing playgrounds for the children, and by encouraging the men to take a more active part in public affairs. After his death on April 8, 1914, Manor residents turned out in the hundreds to attend a memorial service at his house.

The Highland Park Building Company was incorporated in 1914 by long-standing members of his company including builder Robert Lufburrow and engineer Harold Richard Segoine. In 1916, Mrs. Whittlesey, who was president of the Livingston Manor Corporation, turned over the privately owned streets, sidewalks, and curbs to the borough. Remarkably, there were no provisions for the borough to accept public ownership of the sewers. That required an act of legislation at the statehouse in Trenton, which was accomplished by Senator Florance and Assemblyman Edgar and signed by Governor Walter Evans Edge the following year. Anna Wilcox Whittlesey, &quot;Lady of the Manor&quot;, died on August 16, 1918. She was remembered as &quot;a woman of rare refinement and culture, and the soul of hospitality.&quot;

Highland Park&#x27;s identity as a streetcar suburb was transformed to that of an automobile suburb during the 1920s. By 1922, there had been 210 dwellings constructed in Livingston Manor. The Livingston Manor Corporation continued to have transactions into the 1960s, but the area&#x27;s significant development had taken place by 1925.

The Livingston Manor is an important neighborhood in Highland Park. The Livingston Manor Historic District was listed in the New Jersey Register of Historic Places on April 1, 2004, and in the National Register of Historic Places on July 7, 2004.

==Community==
Highland Park has at times been a bedroom community for nearby Rutgers University and Johnson &amp; Johnson in New Brunswick, with a resulting academic flair to the community. Nobel laureate Selman Waksman (Medicine, 1952) lived in the borough until he moved to Piscataway in 1954, and laureate Arno Penzias (Physics, 1978) lived in the borough until the 1990s.

There is a new state-of-the-art environmental center on River Road, just a few hundred feet upstream from the Albany Street Bridge. The borough&#x27;s Environmental Commission envisions this center as a stop along a riverbank walking trail that would link Johnson Park with Donaldson Park and beyond, to the Meadows environmental area on the Edison border.

In 1978, Highland Park became the first municipality in New Jersey to have an eruv, a symbolic enclosure that allows Orthodox Jews to perform certain activities outdoors on the Sabbath that would be otherwise prohibited. Through an arrangement with New Jersey Bell (now Verizon), a continuous wire was strung from pole to pole around portions of the borough. Eventually this expanded and includes portions of Edison and connects with New Brunswick. The wires are inspected every Friday to ensure that the connections are complete. When intact, this eruv satisfies most Orthodox Jewish religious requirements allowing residents to carry objects during the Sabbath.

==Government==

===Local government===

Highland Park is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 (of the 564) municipalities statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Highland Park is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

The borough operates through Committees of the Council: Administration, Finance, Public Works, Public Safety, Community Affairs, Public Utilities, and Health, Welfare and Recreation. The various departments, boards and commissions report to the council through these committees. All elected positions are part-time; the mayor and council members typically hold outside jobs, and receive small salaries from their elected offices.

, the mayor of Highland Park is Democrat Elsie Foster, whose term of office ending on December 31, 2027. Members of the Borough Council are Council President Matthew Hersh (D, 2026), Tara Canavera (D, 2024), Philip George (D, 2025), Matthew Hale (D, 2025), Stephany Kim-Choban (D, 2024) and Jason Postelnik (D, 2026).

In January 2023, the borough council appointed Elsie Foster to fill the vacant seat expiring in December 2023 that had been held by Gayle Brill Mittler until she resigned from office the previous month citing a desire for more time with her family. The next month, Jason Postelnik was appointed to the council seat expiring in December 2023 that was vacated by Elsie Foster when she took office as mayor.

In January 2017, the borough council selected Matthew Hersh to fill the seat expiring in December 2019 that became vacant following the death of Jon Erickson the previous October before Election Day; Erickson&#x27;s name remained on the ballot and he was elected to serve the three-year term. Hersh had earlier been chosen to serve the balance of Erickson&#x27;s previous term that expired in December 2016. In July 2018, Hersh resigned to accept a position with a state agency and was replaced by Matthew Hale.

White-tailed deer are common enough in and around Highland Park to be seen as a problem. A deer population survey which includes Highland Park was conducted by Raritan Valley Community College in December 2019; the borough&#x27;s government was using this survey in 2020 as it made plans for deer management.

<text>Iselin () is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located within Woodbridge Township, in Middlesex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, Iselin&#x27;s population was 20,088, up from 18,695 in 2010.

Previously known as &quot;Perrytown&quot; and &quot;Unionville&quot;, Iselin received its current name after New York City investment banker and philanthropist Adrian Iselin, who established a finishing school in the 1870s for girls from wealthy New York families there. Iselin additionally subsidized the erection of a new train station, which was later replaced by a newer station to the south known as Metropark.

==Geography==
Iselin is in northeastern Middlesex County, in the northwest part of Woodbridge Township. It is bordered by the Woodbridge communities of Colonia to the north, Avenel to the northeast, Woodbridge to the southeast, and Menlo Park Terrace to the south, while to the west it is bordered by Edison Township. It is northeast of New Brunswick, the Middlesex county seat, and southwest of Newark.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Iselin has a total area of , including of water (0.03%). It is drained to the northeast by the South Branch of the Rahway River

=== Downtown area ===
Iselin&#x27;s downtown is centered on Little India (also known as &quot;Oak Tree Road&quot;), bound by the Garden State Parkway to the west and Route 27 (Lincoln Highway) to the southeast. Once home to a wide array of shops, eateries, services, and complemented by a single-screen 1920s movie palace, the area was in obvious decline in the 1980s. An influx of Asian Indian immigration beginning in the early 1990s led to the area&#x27;s revitalization. Formerly vacant stores were tenanted, and additional retail spaces built as the area became known for its high quality Indian food, sweets, clothing (particularly saris), jewelry, music, and other goods.

=== Metropark ===

An area known as Metropark, consisting primarily of office parks and large office buildings, lies in the southwestern corner of Iselin and spills over into neighboring Edison. NJ Transit and Amtrak&#x27;s Metropark station is named for this area.

In addition to a Hilton Hotel (now known as &quot;Hotel Woodbridge at Metropark&quot;) and the train station, Metropark features the headquarters of Ansell Limited, Engelhard (acquired by BASF in 2006) and Eaton Corporation&#x27;s Filtration Division. Other corporate residents in the area include Siemens, Tata Consultancy Services, Mott MacDonald, Ernst &amp; Young, Mizuho, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase, Accenture, Level 3 Communications, BT Group, UBS, Elevance Health, and TIAA.

===Scandal===
In 1993-1994 there was a major state investigation into allegations of corruption by borough officials conducted by the New Jersey State Commission of Investigation: &quot;The Commission launched an investigation into the governmental operations of the Borough of Jamesburg, Middlesex County, in February 1993 after receiving numerous citizen complaints of corruption at the hands of key municipal officials. In a November 1994 report, the Commission revealed a systemic pattern of official misconduct, nepotism and abuse of the public trust so pervasive as to cause local budgetary hardships and jeopardize the local police department. The probe prompted the departure of longtime Borough Tax Assessor Carmen Pirre, spurred a Treasury Department audit and paved the way for wholesale municipal reforms. Richard Gardiner, director of the state Division of Taxation, stated in a February 27, 1995 letter: &quot;This case is a prime example of governmental agencies working in a cooperative and efficient manner to accomplish common goals and to achieve worthwhile objectives.&quot;

==Education==

As of the 2020–21 school year, the district, comprised of two schools, had an enrollment of 664 students and 64.8 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 10.2:1. Schools in the district (with 2020–21 enrollment data from the National Center for Education Statistics) are 
John F. Kennedy Elementary School with 463 students in grades Pre-K–5 and 
Grace M. Breckwedel Middle School with 193 students in grades 6–8.

Jamesburg High School, founded in 1905, graduated its last class in June 1979. Since 1980, Jamesburg&#x27;s high school students attend Monroe Township High School in Monroe Township, as part of a sending/receiving relationship with the Monroe Township School District. As of the 2020–21 school year, the high school had an enrollment of 2,474 students and 184.1 classroom teachers (on an FTE basis), for a student–teacher ratio of 13.4:1.

With annual tuition costs per student at Monroe Township High School rising past $16,000 as the Monroe district has added debt service costs into their tuition charges, the Jamesburg Public Schools looked for an alternate high school in the area to send students at lower cost, which would have started with the freshman class in 2012–2013, though students already enrolled at Monroe Township High School would continue their attendance there until they graduate. The Jamesburg district contacted 18 districts and received interest from high schools in the Freehold Regional High School District, Matawan-Aberdeen Regional School District, Old Bridge Township Public Schools, South Amboy Public Schools and the West Windsor-Plainsboro Regional School District, which had been sent demographic information in July 2011 about the Jamesburg high school population as part of their review process. By October 2011, the district decided to maintain sending students to Monroe Township, as had been done since 1979.

Eighth grade students from all of Middlesex County are eligible to apply to attend the high school programs offered by the Middlesex County Magnet Schools, a county-wide vocational school district that offers full-time career and technical education at its schools in East Brunswick, Edison, Perth Amboy, Piscataway and Woodbridge Township, with no tuition charged to students for attendance.

<text>Kendall Park is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in South Brunswick Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2020 census, the CDP&#x27;s population was 9,989, up from 9,339 in 2010. Kendall Park has a post office with its own ZIP Code (08824) that encompasses the majority of the CDP, as well as some surrounding areas.

==History==
Kendall Park gets its name from its builder, Herbert Kendall, who developed a planned community of 1,500 houses between 1956 and 1961. Kendall&#x27;s development was built in three stages: the initial development in 1956-7 (between New Road and Sand Hill Road), the Constable development in 1959 (south of New Road), followed by the Greenbrook development (north of Sand Hill Road) in 1961. The initial development offered two styles of three-bedroom, 1½ bath ranch-style homes, mostly built on 1/3 acre lots, typically selling for around $16,000 in 1957. The subsequent sections offered a wider selection of styles, including four-bedroom ranches and four-bedroom colonial-style homes. The development of Kendall Park doubled the population of South Brunswick Township and marked the beginning of its transformation from a rural farming area to a suburban bedroom community. Several other nearby tracts developed after Kendall&#x27;s original development are also part of the CDP.

The Hoagland-Clark House, which dates back to the late 18th century, is a remnant of the earlier era, and was identified by Preservation New Jersey as one of the most vulnerable landmarks in New Jersey.

==Geography==
Kendall Park is in southwestern Middlesex County, in the northwest part of South Brunswick Township. It is bordered to the south by Heathcote, also within South Brunswick Township, and to the west and northwest by the communities of Ten Mile Run and Franklin Park in Franklin Township, Somerset County.

New Jersey Route 27 (Lincoln Highway) runs along the northwest border of Kendall Park, following the county line, while U.S. Route 1 runs along the community&#x27;s southeast border. Both highways lead northeast to New Brunswick, the Middlesex county seat. Route 27 leads southwest from Kendall Park to Princeton, while Route 1 leads southwest to Trenton, the state capital.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Kendall Park CDP has a total area of , of which , or 0.05%, are water.

<doc id="125423" wikidata="Q371824" url="?curid=125423" title="Kingston, New Jersey">
<text>Kingston is an unincorporated community and census designated place (CDP) along the border of South Brunswick Township in Middlesex County and Franklin Township in Somerset County, and also located relatively near Princeton in Mercer County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The historic settlement is in the Raritan Valley region, located along the course of the Millstone River. As of the 2020 census, the CDP&#x27;s population was 1,581, of which 1,272 were in South Brunswick Township and 309 in Franklin Township.

The New Jersey State Planning Commission created the Kingston Village Advisory Committee in 2001 to address issues related to this distinct area. Both South Brunswick and Franklin appoint members to the committee, which holds an annual meeting to discuss issues pertinent to the Kingston area. Kingston is (so far) unique as the only village center that has been officially designated by the New Jersey State Planning Commission.

Kingston is located in five historic districts and is part of the Millstone River Valley Scenic Byway. The Delaware and Raritan Canal and Rockingham State Historic Site are a short distance away.

==History==
Jediah Higgins purchased from the Native Americans in the early 18th century and the town of Kingston was established. Kingston&#x27;s location on the Lenape Assunpink Trail where it crossed the Millstone River and later becoming part of the King&#x27;s Highway was the prime factor in its early prominence. Kingston was by far the most active and important village, being situated on both the heavily traveled King&#x27;s Road and Millstone River, combining commercial activities of both mills and taverns.

==Geography==
Kingston is in southwestern Middlesex County, in the western end of South Brunswick Township, and in southern Somerset County, occupying the southern tip of Franklin Township. It is bordered to the east by Heathcote in Middlesex County and to the north by East Rocky Hill in Somerset County. It is bordered to the west by the Millstone River, which forms the Mercer County line. The borough of Princeton borders Kingston across the Millstone River.

New Jersey Route 27 is Kingston&#x27;s Main Street; Route 27 leads southwest to its terminus in the center of Princeton, and northeast to New Brunswick, the Middlesex county seat.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Kingston CDP has an area of , of which are land and , or 3.55%, are water. The Millstone River, which runs along the western edge of Kingston, is a north-flowing tributary of the Raritan River and thus part of the watershed of Lower New York Bay.

==Religion==

===Kingston Presbyterian Church===
The Kingston Presbyterian Church was organized in 1723 and was initially located in a log building adjacent to the Millstone River. The old tombstones surround the site where the church once stood in the Kingston Cemetery. The Reverend Eleazer Wales was the first recorded minister of the church. The original church building in the cemetery burned down in 1791, and new building was erected in 1792 on the original foundation. The congregation used this building until 1852, when the larger building on Main Street in Kingston was constructed on land purchased from Elijah Stout. In 1853, the church building in the cemetery was sold and was later dismantled. Two additions were constructed on the 1852 site. Sunday school rooms were added to the back of the structure in the late 1940s. In the late 1980s another addition was added which added a new kitchen facility, additional space in the assembly room, pastors study and office.

The church suffered through some difficult times during the remainder of the 1700s. During this period, Princeton University was built and the village of Princeton expanded, while the population of Kingston declined. (At that time, Kingston extended as far as Snowden Lane.) Consequently, the church lost many members to the &quot;new&quot; Presbyterian Church down the road in Princeton.

It was also during this time that the Revolutionary War was fought in the area, and British officers were quartered in local homes. Gen. Washington became a recognizable figure in the Kingston area at the time. Not only did he lead his troops past the church to escape Cornwallis, but he also had his headquarters hardly a mile from the church while the Continental Congress sat in Nassau Hall.

In 1800, the Kingston Presbyterian Church began a period of prosperity and growth, which continues to this day. The church sent its first foreign missionaries to China in the early 1800s.

===Kingston United Methodist Church===
During the month of February 1878, the people of the Methodist Episcopal Church at Rocky Hill brought an evangelist, Miss Lizzie Sharp, to conduct revival meetings in their church. There were some twenty or more of Kingston people who attended these meetings, and who decided to form a Methodist church in Kingston. A site was purchased for $250 on what is now Church Street, across from the Kingston Cemetery. Building began September 20, 1878, and was completed and dedicated on January 30, 1879. A nursery was later added.

<doc id="125424" wikidata="Q1086199" url="?curid=125424" title="Laurence Harbor, New Jersey">
<text>Laurence Harbor is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located along Raritan Bay within Old Bridge Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2020 United States census, the CDP&#x27;s population was 6,635, an increase of 99 (+1.5%) from the 6,536 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn reflected an increase of 309 (+5.0%) from the 6,227 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==

The lands known today as Laurence Harbor were part of the southernmost region inhabited by the Lenni Lenape tribe (also known as the Delaware) in the 17th century. In 1664, they became part of greater East Jersey, and in 1684 became part of South Amboy, which was much larger than it is today. In 1869, Madison Township split off from South Amboy; it was renamed Old Bridge Township in 1975.

European settlement of the area was linked to commerce passing through the Amboys along the Raritan River. From a military perspective, the area was useful for its high bayside cliffs, which allowed strategic observation of ships traveling between New York Harbor and the Atlantic Ocean.

Laurence Harbor is named after land developer Laurence Lamb, who bought property in what was then known as Madison Township at the turn of the 20th century and subdivided it into bungalow-sized lots. Lamb established a shorefront golf and country club on the site. Among those who frequented Mr. Lamb&#x27;s establishment were Clark Gable, Guy Lombardo, the Prince of Wales and the Vanderbilts, who came to party and eat chingarora oysters, for which Raritan Bay was then famous. In 1928, the golf club was sold to developers for the above-mentioned construction of bungalows. A boardwalk, complete with a dance hall, casino, band shell, concession stands and a merry-go-round that played only one song, &quot;Let&#x27;s Remember Pearl Harbor&quot;, provided entertainment, hot dogs and ice cream during the 1940s.

For those traveling south from North Jersey or New York, it was the first stretch of Jersey Shore beachfront before reaching Keansburg or Asbury Park.

According to a local historian who grew up in Old Bridge Township, the area was used during Prohibition by rum runners who would lower their cargo of bootleg liquor overboard into the bay to be hauled ashore by local fishermen.

The Ochwald Brickworks, a brickyard, operated in the area where the Bridgepointe townhouses now stand. The brick plant began operation in the early 1900s and continued to the early 1960s. Its 60 workers produced more than 84,000 bricks per day. Nothing remains of the plant as all was demolished for residential dwellings.

==Geography==
Laurence Harbor is the easternmost community in Middlesex County and occupies the northeast corner of Old Bridge Township. It is bordered to the north by Raritan Bay; to the northwest by Cheesequake Creek, across which is the neighborhood of Morgan within the borough of Sayreville; to the southwest by the Garden State Parkway; and to the southeast by the communities of Cliffwood and Cliffwood Beach in Monmouth County.

The CDP is located off Exit 120 of the Garden State Parkway. The main routes are Laurence Parkway and New Jersey Route 35. The railroad, which no longer has a station in Laurence Harbor (it had a Morgan station during most of the first half of the 20th century, located right across Cheesequake Creek from Laurence Harbor), divides the community into eastern and western sections, the former being locally referred to as &quot;The Front&quot;.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Laurence Harbor CDP has a total area of , including of land and of water (1.83%).

The community&#x27;s shoreline looks directly north upon Staten Island&#x27;s southern shore; the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, Lower Manhattan (including the Empire State Building, on a clear night) and Brooklyn can also be seen.

==Housing==
As this area was considered a beach resort back in the 1920s to 1950s, some houses along the waterfront and off Route 35 are bungalow style. Many have been updated to year-round use, and some lots have been combined to build much larger houses or additions. Built along the high waterfront cliffs, many of the houses have a waterfront view overlooking Raritan Bay, the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, Outerbridge Crossing and New York City (Lower Manhattan, Staten Island and Brooklyn) in the distance. The higher elevation protects most of the homes from flooding and provides the benefit of a shore view without flood insurance.

Bridgepointe, an upscale condo/townhouse development, was completed in 2005 and is located off Matawan Road very close to the Garden State Parkway Exit 120. This development, along with the Parkview at Madison Apartment complex, also nearby, serves the needs of many commuters who make the daily work trek to New York and North Jersey. A large cleared area of land located behind Bridgepointe and Parkview at Madison was slated for a high-end hotel, convention center, business complex, a New Jersey Transit train station and housing. Construction never began; however, the plans still remain on hold and are occasionally brought up within the township.

==Parks and recreation==
Laurence Harbor is home to Old Bridge Waterfront Park, which consists of a new boardwalk (the old boardwalk was destroyed in the 1940–1950s) that was completed in 2002. The beachfront was redone through a joint venture by Old Bridge Township, New Jersey and Middlesex County Parks Department. It extends approximately one mile from the Old Bridge Police substation south, to the Aberdeen Township neighborhood of Cliffwood Beach, and runs parallel with New Jersey Route 35. This area is very popular for fishing as three jetties extend into Raritan Bay and are in excellent condition, also recently redone in the past ten years. The park&#x27;s boardwalk is also popular for jogging and dog walking. At the northern parking lot of the park, there is bay beach swimming access along with a bathroom and showers.

On October 29, 2012, Hurricane Sandy slammed the greater Raritan Bayshore region. Its resulting storm surge, estimated to be in excess of above sea level, destroyed portions of the Old Bridge Waterfront Park.

Following Sandy, improvements to the boardwalk jetty and parks were performed in 2014 when the resources became available. There are now new parks and a new boardwalk and jetty railing, and improved erosion protection along the bay&#x27;s edge.


==Environment==
Laurence Harbor is surrounded by diverse wetlands and bay front. The shallow bay front provides habitat for migratory birds to stop and feed. Except for a few cold winter months, great egrets can be seen frequently in the area. In late September and October before freezing temperatures, the egrets can be found in large numbers. Large Atlantic horseshoe crabs can be seen in the hundreds spawning along the shoreline in April. During fall and early spring, sea gulls can be seen foraging for food by picking mussels and clams out of the bay, flying up, and dropping them on the local jetties to break them open and feed.

A diverse range of fish frequent and spawn in the local waters. Striped bass feed along the coastline in the early spring when the water temperature reaches approximately 45 degrees, begin to leave when the water gets warm enough for the bluefish, and return when the water cools in the fall. With birds at times following their feeding frenzies, bluefish feed heavily when they first arrive in spring. Various size bluefish remain in the water throughout the summer and into fall. Other fish that are known to be along the bay are black drum, fluke, winter flounder, eels, cow nose rays, skate, and weakfish.

Along the boardwalk amongst the sand dunes, there are honeysuckle trees that blossom in the spring. There have been sightings of wildlife such as the common box turtle along the boardwalk.

==Pollution and lead contamination==
Pollution issues are being addressed on the southern half of the Old Bridge Waterfront Park. The main beach has been contaminated with toxic levels of lead. The Environmental Protection Agency has closed the beach to the public. There is information on the site at their web site under the National Priorities List for the Raritan Bay Slag Superfund Site. It is believed that slag from the National Lead factory in Sayreville was placed along the retaining wall in the 1960s and the 1970s to prevent erosion. Additionally, the same slag was used to build an entire jetty on the northern end of Morgan Bridge in Morgan. The slag comes in the form of about 20&quot; diameter discs similar in shape to tire hubs and some are disc halves. The slag was a byproduct from the lead refining process that contains mostly steel with small percentages of lead and other heavy metals. The slag does not significantly affect the water quality due to dilution from ocean water that continuously comes in and out of the bay. Testing showed that the sand under the slag has lead particulates that have separated over time and there are traces of lead particulates in the sand below the tidal line. Once the slag is removed or contained the beach will be reopened.

<doc id="125426" wikidata="Q1021527" url="?curid=125426" title="Metuchen, New Jersey">
<text>Metuchen ( ) is a suburban borough in Middlesex County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The borough is a commuter town of New York City, located in the heart of the Raritan Valley region within the New York Metropolitan area. The borough, along with Edison (which completely surrounds Metuchen), is a regional commercial hub for Central New Jersey. The borough is northeast of New Brunswick, southwest of Newark, southwest of Jersey City, and southwest of Manhattan. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 15,049, an increase of 1,475 (+10.9%) from the 2010 census count of 13,574, which in turn reflected an increase of 734 (+5.7%) from the 12,840 counted in the 2000 census.

Metuchen was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 20, 1900, from portions of Raritan Township (now known as Edison). Metuchen&#x27;s Main Street won &quot;Great American Main Street of the Year&quot; in 2023.

==History==

The earliest residents of the area were the Raritan people of the Lenape Native Americans, who lived in the area and travelled through it to the shore. In 1646, Chief Matouchin was part of a group that included 1,200 warriors.

Until 1870, what is now Metuchen was part of Woodbridge Township. The settlers in the western part of the township developed their own separate identity, because they were so far removed from the main settlement of Woodbridge. The name &quot;Metuchen&quot; first appeared in 1688/1689, and its name was derived from the name of a Native American chief, whose name was variously spelled as Matouchin or Matochshegan. In 1701, an overseer of roads was appointed for &quot;Metuchen district&quot;. In 1705, Main Street was laid out at the same time as the road from Metuchen to Woodbridge, which one source calls a &quot;reworking of the original road&quot;.

Sometime between 1717 and 1730, a meeting house was constructed for weekday meetings conducted by the pastor of the Woodbridge Presbyterian Church. In 1756, Metuchen Presbyterians succeeded in forming their own congregation, attesting to their growing numbers. In 1770, the congregations merged, with Metuchen getting 2/5 of the pastor&#x27;s services and Woodbridge 3/5; by 1772, Metuchen had grown sufficiently to warrant half of his time. In 1793, the two churches again separated.

Metuchen was little changed from the late 18th to the early 19th century. A map from 1799 shows ten buildings in the center of the community along Main Street. By 1834, a Presbyterian church, a store, two taverns and about a dozen dwellings could be found. The opening of the Middlesex and Essex Turnpike (now Middlesex Avenue, portions in concurrency with Route 27) in 1806, and the Perth Amboy and Bound Brook Turnpike in 1808 did not spur growth. Not until the beginning of the railroad era did commercial and residential development surge.

In 1836, the New Jersey Railroad was completed to New Brunswick. The construction of a station at Main Street made it inevitable that this would develop as the principal street. A business section soon began to appear between Middlesex Avenue and the railroad tracks, and commercial and service establishments gradually began to assume a more modern aspect (the typical 18th century tavern, for example, was replaced by the equally typical 19th century hotel).

The second half of the 19th century was a period of social, cultural and religious diversification in Metuchen. Between 1859 and 1866 the Reformed Church was organized, the first Catholic mass was celebrated and St. Luke&#x27;s Episcopal Church was founded. In 1870 both the Building and Loan Association and the library opened, the same year that Raritan Township was incorporated. As the largest village in the new township, Metuchen naturally became its commercial and cultural center and acquired substantial political control. In 1873, the town hosted Howard Newton Fuller and the Rutgers College Glee Club in the first-ever performance of their alma mater. In 1879, the literary and debating society was formed, and in 1883 the Village Improvement Society. By 1882, Metuchen School #15 had an enrollment of 256 pupils, and by 1885 the New Jersey Gazette listed 37 businesses.

The decade of the 1890s was a period of expansion for public utilities. In 1894, telegraph service was begun and in 1897 telephone service begun by the N.Y. and N.J. Telephone Company. In the same year the Midland Water Company began operation and supplied hydrants for &quot;newly formed&quot; volunteer fire companies. In 1899, a new street lighting system was installed. At about the same time a bicycling organization was formed, the Metuchen Wheelmen, which lobbied for improved roads. Trolley service began in 1900. In addition, commerce had grown to such an extent that the New Brunswick Directory listed 91 businesses in 1899.

Metuchen attracted an influx of artists, literary figures and noted intellectuals during this time, acquiring the nickname &quot;the Brainy Boro&quot;. One of the Borough&#x27;s two post offices is named Brainy Boro Station.

The new century began with the borough&#x27;s incorporation, in 1900.

On November 19, 1981, Metuchen became the Seat of the newly established Roman Catholic Diocese of Metuchen. The diocese includes Hunterdon, Middlesex, Somerset and Warren counties and more than 500,000 Catholics.

Metuchen Borough Hall, dedicated in 2005, replaced a structure built in 1924 during the City Beautiful movement.

From 1948 until 2004, the Ford Motor Company manufactured seven million Ford and Mercury vehicles, including the Ford Mustang, at Edison Assembly, which was named for Metuchen until 1980.

In 2022, Metuchen was nominated as one of the eight semifinalists for the &quot;2023 Great American Main Street Award&quot; . They later won the award.

American Girl&#x27;s 2023 &quot;Girl of the Year&quot; character, Kavi Sharma, is described as being from Metuchen. She is the first &quot;Girl of the Year&quot; doll of South Asian ancestry.

In April 2024, Metuchen was named by &quot;Money Magazine&quot; as the best place to live in New Jersey and one of the best to live in the country.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Jefferson Park and Robinvale.

Metuchen has been a state-designated &quot;town center&quot; since 1996 and &quot;transit village&quot; since 2001. The borough has been recognized for its smart growth development. Plans to build a residential and commercial center with 700 parking spaces on a parking lot adjacent to the train station were announced in July 2014.

<text>Middlesex is a borough in Middlesex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is located within the Raritan Valley region. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 14,636, its highest decennial count and an increase of 1,001 (+7.3%) from the 2010 census count of 13,635, which in turn reflected a decline of 82 (−0.6%) from the 13,717 counted in the 2000 census.

Middlesex was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 9, 1913, from portions of Piscataway, based on the results of a referendum held on May 6, 1913. The borough was named after Middlesex, England.

==History==
The Harris Lane School was a one-room schoolhouse that was the oldest school in Middlesex County, dating back to its construction in the 1790s. The original Pierce School was known as the East Bound Brook School House and The Parker House was also used for education until it was converted into a two-family house. As the Borough grew new schools were constructed to accommodate many more students. Our Lady of Mt. Virgin School was the first parochial school built in 1954.

In 1905, the Lincoln section of Middlesex organized a volunteer fire company and that set the organization of four other fire companies in the borough.

Middlesex was a portion of Piscataway Township, until May 6, 1913, when it was incorporated as a separate entity through the action of the state legislature and local referendum. George Harris was elected as the first mayor and the first borough council was elected at the same time. Two constables were the law enforcement officers and were soon assisted by five appointed marshals.

==Government==

===Local government===

Middlesex is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Middlesex is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

The seven-member governing body is empowered to enact local ordinances, to levy municipal taxes and conduct the affairs of the community. In almost all cases, it can review and approve the actions of other Middlesex Borough committees and agencies. The mayor and Borough Council conduct all of their business during monthly meetings open to the public. All legislative powers of the borough are exercised by the mayor and council. These powers can take the form of a resolution, ordinance or proclamation.

, the mayor of Middlesex is Republican John &quot;Jack&quot; Mikolajczyk, whose term of office ends December 31, 2023. Members of the Middlesex Borough Council are Council President Michael Conahan (R, 2026), Jeremiah A. Carnes (R, 2025), Robert Dessino (R, 2025), Kevin Dotey (R, 2026), Martin Quinn (R, 2024) and Douglas Rex (R, 2024).

In July 2022, the borough council appointed Michael Conahan to fill the seat expiring in December 2023 that had been held by Amy Flood. Conahan served on an interim basis until the November 2022 election when he was elected to serve the balance of the term.

In January 2020, the borough council appointed Amy Flood to fill the seat expiring in December 2020 that was vacated by John L. Madden when he took office as mayor.

Until his selection in early 2006 to serve as borough administrator, Ron Dobies had been one of the longest-tenured mayors in New Jersey, with 26 years of service to Middlesex. Dobies left his position as mayor in 2006 and took a position as the borough&#x27;s administrator. After being fired in 2008, he was successful in his suit against the borough and was restored to his position. In 2011 he ran for mayor again and won a four-year term that ended in 2015.

<text>Milltown is a borough in Middlesex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The borough is nestled within the heart of the Raritan Valley region, with Lawrence Brook (a Raritan river tributary) flowing through the center of the community. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 7,037, an increase of 144 (+2.1%) from the 2010 census count of 6,893, which in turn reflected a decrease of 107 (−1.5%) from the 7,000 counted in the 2000 census.

Milltown was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on January 29, 1889, from portions of North Brunswick, based on the results of a referendum held three days earlier. The borough was reincorporated by resolution of the borough council on May 2, 1896. A portion of East Brunswick Township was annexed in 1902. Originally known as Bergen&#x27;s Mill, named for Jacob I. Bergen who owned the grist mill, the name is believed to have become &quot;Milltown&quot; from residents &quot;going to the mill in town&quot;.

As of the 2000 Census, the center of population for New Jersey was located in Milltown, at Milltown Road, just east of the New Jersey Turnpike (see map of location). Based on the results of the 2010 census, the center of population had shifted to East Brunswick.

==History==
Long before the arrival of the first Europeans, the Lenape Native Americans had established settlements along the Lawrence Brook. The discovery of many artifacts in the area above today&#x27;s municipal building (now a small county park) suggests the presence of a Native American settlement. In 1678, Thomas Lawrence, a New York baker, acquired a large area around the Lawrence Brook, which likely included today&#x27;s Milltown. The Lawrence Brook was then called Piscopeek (and on later maps, Lawrence&#x27;s Brook). The names and marks of several Native Americans (Quemareck, Quesiacs, Isarick, Metapis, Peckawan and Turantaca) appear on the bill of sale. In 1769, Fulcard Van Nordstrand advertised the sale of a large gristmill on the bank of Lawrence Brook. It would soon be called Lawrence Brook Mill. The 1903 classic western film &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; was shot in Milltown.

After the end of World War I, the &quot;Michelin Illustrated Guides to the Battlefields (1914-1918)&quot; of the Western Front were published in Milltown.

In March 2010, the Milltown City Council voted against changing the name of Petain Avenue, citing the difficulties that the street&#x27;s residents would endure if the name changed. Petain Avenue is named for Philippe Pétain, a French World War I general who became the leader of the Vichy France government during World War II. The Vichy Regime willfully collaborated with Nazi Germany, taking state action against &quot;undesirables&quot;, including Jews, Protestants, gays, gypsies, and left-wing activists. In total, the Vichy government participated in the deportation of 76,000 Jews to German extermination camps, although this number varies depending on the account; only 2,500 survived the war. After the war, Petain was charged with perjury and sentenced to death, though this was commuted to life imprisonment due to his advanced age. By contrast, in France itself, the French government has since changed the name of every street formerly named after Petain.

The groundbreaking anxiolytic and sedative drug Miltown (meprobamate) developed by Carter Products, which became available to the public in the mid-1950s, was named for the borough.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 1.60 square miles (4.13 km2), including 1.55 square miles (4.02 km2) of land and 0.04 square miles (0.11 km2) of water (2.56%).

The borough borders North Brunswick to the west and East Brunswick to the east.

The Lawrence Brook, a tributary of the Raritan River, flows through the borough after exiting the Farrington Lake; a dam, under Main Street, creates a reservoir, the Mill Pond. The brook&#x27;s watershed covers that includes Milltown and East Brunswick, New Brunswick, North Brunswick and South Brunswick.

<text>Alun Lewis (1 July 1915 – 5 March 1944) was a Welsh poet. He is one of the best-known English-language war poets of the Second World War. His poetry centres around a &quot;recurring obsession with the themes of isolation and death.&quot;

== Life and work ==
Alun Lewis, was born on 1 July 1915 at Cwmaman, near Aberdare in the Cynon Valley of the South Wales Coalfields. His parents, Thomas John and Gwladys Lewis, were school teachers at Llanwern; and he had a younger sister, Mair and two brothers. By the time he won a scholarship to attend Cowbridge Grammar School, he was already interested in writing. He went on to study at Aberystwyth University and the University of Manchester. Although he was born in South Wales, he wrote in English only.

Lewis was unsuccessful as a journalist and instead earned his living as a supply teacher. He met the poet Lynette Roberts (whose poem &quot;Llanybri&quot; is an invitation to him to visit her home), even though she was married to another poet, Keidrych Rhys. In 1939, Lewis met Gweno Meverid Ellis, a teacher, whom he married on 5 July 1941.

After the outbreak of the Second World War Lewis first joined the British Army&#x27;s Royal Engineers as a Private because he was a pacifist, but still wanted to fight fascism. However, he then inexplicably sought and gained a commission in an infantry battalion. In 1941 he collaborated with artists John Petts and Brenda Chamberlain on the &quot;Caseg broadsheets&quot;. His first published book was the poetry collection &quot;Raider&#x27;s Dawn and other poems&quot; (1942), which was followed by a volume of short stories, &quot;The Last Inspection&quot; (1942). In 1942 he was sent to India with the 6th battalion South Wales Borderers.

Lewis&#x27;s poems about his war experiences have been described as showing &quot;his brooding over his army experiences and trying to catch and hold some vision that would illuminate its desolation with meaning&quot; (see Ian Hamilton &quot;Alun Lewis Selected Poetry and Prose) Scholars have noted the thematic and formal influence of Edward Thomas on his work—Lewis&#x27;s poem &quot;To Edward Thomas&quot; is dedicated to the poet.

Lewis died on 5 March 1944 during the Burma campaign against the Imperial Japanese Army. He was found shot in the head, after shaving and washing, near the officers&#x27; latrines, with his revolver in his hand, and died from his wound six hours later. Despite it being a case of suicide, a court of inquiry charitably concluded that he had tripped and that the shooting was an accident. He is buried at Taukkyan War Cemetery.

His second book of poems, &quot;Ha! Ha! Among the Trumpets. Poems in Transit&quot;, was published in 1945, and his &quot;Letters from India&quot; in 1946. Several collections of his poems, letters and stories have been published subsequently.

<text>Cowbridge () is a market town in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, approximately west of the centre of Cardiff.

The Cowbridge with Llanblethian community and civil parish elect a town council.
A Cowbridge electoral ward exists for elections to the Vale of Glamorgan Council. This ward includes Cowbridge, Llanblethian and Llanfair.

The total population of the ward taken at the 2011 census was 6,180.

==Etymology==
The town is first recorded as &quot;Pontyfon&quot;, (with &quot;mon&quot; or &quot;fon&quot; meaning cow in Old Welsh), and as &quot;Pontyfuwch&quot; (bridge of the cow in modern Welsh) by 1645. The modern Welsh name, &quot;Y Bont-faen&quot;, translates as &#x27;the stone bridge&#x27;. The English name is a direct translation of the older Welsh name of the town.

==History==
===Roman times===

The town lies on the site of a Roman settlement identified by some scholars as the fort of &quot;Bovium&quot; (cow-place). Recent excavations have revealed extensive Roman settlement; the town lies alongside a Roman road.

===Middle Ages===

The town centre is arranged on its medieval plan, with one long street divided into &quot;burgage plots&quot;. It is one of very few medieval walled towns in Wales, and substantial portions of the walls, together with the south gate, are still standing. On 13 March 1254, Cowbridge received its first borough charter from Richard de Clare, the Lord of Glamorgan. Richard de Clare was one of the most powerful Barons of the day, having huge estates stretching across much of south Wales and also lands in southeast England.

The town walls were built sometime in the latter half of the 13th century. From 1243, de Clare was actively extending his authority in Glamorgan. In 1245, he seized the manors of Llanblethian, Ruthin and Talyfan from Richard Siward, and the lordships of Miskin and Glynrhondda from Hywel ap Maredudd. In Llanblethian he founded the town of Cowbridge and in Miskin he founded the castle and town of Llantrisant. The largely medieval church of the Holy Cross was initially a chapel of ease to the parish church at Llanblethian. In 1307 Earl Gilbert de Clare, grandson of Richard de Clare, began work on the stone fortifications of St Quintins Castle in Llanblethian.

The Battle of Stalling Down was fought near Cowbridge between an English army, serving Henry IV of England and a combined force of French and Welsh soldiers under Owain Glyndŵr in 1403. Details of the battle, its exact site and its outcome are scant, but the site has been recognised by Cadw for possible inclusion in a Register of Historic Battlefields in Wales.

===Georgian times===

The 18th century antiquary, Iolo Morganwg, inventor of the present-day rituals of the National Eisteddfod of Wales, kept a bookshop in the High Street, the location of which is now marked with a plaque inscribed with the words &quot;Y Gwir yn erbyn y Byd&quot; (&quot;Truth against the world&quot;) in Roman and Coelbren y Beirdd script. It was just outside the town that he held the first meeting of the Gorsedd, an assembly of bards, in 1795. Cowbridge Grammar School was founded in 1608 and had close links with Jesus College, Oxford through its later benefactor, Dr Leoline Jenkins. Its famous pupils included the poet Alun Lewis and the actor Sir Anthony Hopkins. The old grammar school eventually merged with Cowbridge High School for Girls to become a comprehensive school, and the original buildings, having for some time lain derelict, have been converted into private accommodation.

===Notable buildings===
The present Cowbridge Town Hall, a building whose foundations date back perhaps as far as the Elizabethan era, served as a prison until 1830, when it was converted into a town hall to replace the former guildhall, demolished at that date. The conversion was completed in 1830 by Isaiah Verity of Ash Hall who in gratitude was made a Freeman of Cowbridge.

Eight of the original prison cells are still intact, six of which house the exhibits of Cowbridge Museum. The remainder of the building is used by the town council and for public events. The museum holds archaeological finds from Cowbridge and district, as well as displays on the later history of the town, including industrial and domestic artefacts, a photographic collection, and a small historical costume collection.

The main street contains a number of Georgian houses, including the former town houses of important local families such as the Edmondes and Carnes. The Carnes&#x27; town house is known as Great House, a Grade 2* listed property of Medieval origin.

===Modern times===
Cowbridge contains the following inns: the Bear Hotel, the Horse and Groom, the Edmondes Arms, the Duke of Wellington and the Vale of Glamorgan. The latter is located at the premises of the former Vale of Glamorgan Brewery.

Closely attached to the town of Cowbridge is the village of Aberthin. Aberthin contains two inns; The Hare and Hounds and The Farmers Arms.

Cowbridge once had a railway station, which opened in 1865 and closed in 1951.

On the 21 March 1950 a Bristol Freighter (Registration: G-AHJJ) on a test flight took off from Bristol Filton Airport. The aircraft crashed near Cowbridge after a structural failure of the fuselage. It caused the aircraft to enter spin and crash. The accident killed all four passengers and crew on board.

Cowbridge was named one of the best places to live in Wales in 2017.

==Schools==
Cowbridge Grammar School (founded 1608, closed 1974) was merged with other local schools to form Cowbridge Comprehensive School in 1973–4. The disused main building on Town Mill Road was converted to residences in 2006-8 and its associated prefabricated classrooms replaced by housing in 2013.

Cowbridge Girls School, (previously known as Cowbridge Intermediate School for Girls) was built in 1896 and was the first school for girls built in Wales after the Welsh Intermediate Education Act (1889) provided for state-funding of education for all children. It included a hostel for boarders (funded by philanthropist John Bevan, a Cowbridge solicitor) so that girls could attend from a wider area. The school building was designed by Robert Williams. It was built from dressed limestone in a baronial style. It was extended in 1909, designed by Rhys S. Griffiths to match with the original building and this included a science laboratory, gym and more hostel accommodation as well as additional classrooms. At the formation of Cowbridge Comprehensive School in 1973-4 its building was used for the sixth form. When new buildings meant the whole school could be brought together on one site, it was unused after 2010. Proposals to demolish the building, or alternatively convert it and surrounding space to new housing, were made between 2018 and 2020. A request for it to be listed by Cadw was rejected because of lack of distinctiveness in the building and some modern alterations.

=== Secondary Schools ===
Cowbridge Comprehensive School is an English-medium secondary school. As of 2021, the school had approximately 1528 pupils. It is one of the best performing secondary schools in Wales. It achieved 94% A*-C at GCSE in 2010. The school was located on three sites, with the Lower School in the south-west of the town and Middle School and Sixth Form in the north-east. Cowbridge Comprehensive School completed a major redevelopment in September 2010 to bring the entire school to one site (the former Middle School/Sixth Form site) using Welsh Assembly Government funding.

In September 2010, the new school was officially opened to students. All students can now be found on the one site, instead of the three separate buildings that were all situated in different locations in Cowbridge. The former sixth form site on Aberthin Road is now derelict and awaiting redevelopment.

=== Primary Schools ===
Y Bontfaen Primary School is an English-medium school situated in Borough Close. As of 2021, it has a roll of 279 pupils.

Ysgol Iolo Morganwg is a Welsh-medium school situated in Broadway. As of June 2022, there were 203 pupils on roll, with 73.4% coming from Welsh-speaking homes.

==Sport==
Cowbridge is home to Welsh Rugby Union team Cowbridge RFC which fields two senior teams, a youth team and a ladies team.
Cowbridge Cricket Club, part of the Cowbridge and District Athletic Club, first played in 1840. The club now has six teams and is affiliated to the South Wales Cricket Association, Cricket Wales and the South Wales Premier Cricket League. Notable cricketers who have played for the club include former test players Hugh Morris, John Clay, Tony Lewis, C F Walters and on one famous occasion Douglas Jardine. Among the many county cricketers produced by the club are the Glamorgan players Ben Wright and Alex Jones. Glamorgan CCC played county fixtures at Cowbridge in the 1930s. The club&#x27;s 1st XI won the Dan Radcliffe Cup in 2019 as Champions of the South Wales Cricket Association with Christopher Willey as the captain. Ben Wright scored a club record 1,395 runs in the season.

Cowbridge has a leisure centre with tennis, football and badminton clubs. Behind Cowbridge Leisure Centre is Cowbridge Bowling Club and tennis courts.

September 2009 also saw the reintroduction of senior football to Cowbridge Town FC after a ten-year absence. Starting in the third tier of the Vale of Glamorgan Amateur Football League the team achieved great success in their first season back, achieving an unlikely cup-promotion double. The 2011–12 season saw the club gain their second promotion in three years to reach the premier division.

==Cultural activities==
Cowbridge is home to the Cowbridge Amateur Dramatic Society (CADS), based at the Market Theatre. CADS was formed in 1947 and aims to stage three main productions each year. The Society also publishes a newsletter, &quot;The Thespian&quot;, three or four times each year.

Until 1997, when it &#x27;outgrew&#x27; the Town Hall stage, Cowbridge was home to the Cowbridge Amateur Operatic Society (CAOS). Founded by a small group of enthusiasts, its first production was &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; in 1969. CAOS continued its Gilbert and Sullivan theme until 1974, when the show of the year was &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;. Still going strong, CAOS is now based at Llantwit Major.

Since 2004, the town has hosted the annual Cowbridge Food and Drink Festival. Currently, the festival takes place in late spring having originally taken place every October. The festival incorporates various food and drink exhibitors, food court and fringe festival. Many of the town&#x27;s inns hold beer, ale and cider events.

In 2010 the Cowbridge Music Festival was founded which takes place every autumn in various venues throughout the town. The festival is made up of classical music, jazz and folk music and boasts an excellent outreach programme. In 2014 the acclaimed violinist Nicola Benedetti became the festival&#x27;s patron.

Cowbridge History Society was created in 2013 out of a merger between the former Cowbridge &amp; District Local History Society (founded in the 1970s) and Cowbridge Record Society, publishers of several books on the topics relating to the history of the town. It holds monthly meetings at the Town Hall throughout the winter and funds a Local History Studies Room (the &quot;Jeff Alden Room&quot;) containing archival material.

<text>Monroe Township is a township located in southern Middlesex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The township is centrally located within the Raritan Valley region and is an outer-ring suburb of New York City within the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 48,594, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 9,462 (+24.2%) from the 39,132 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn reflected an increase of 11,133 (+39.8%) from the 27,999 counted in the 2000 census. Monroe Township also comprises the largest land area of any municipality in Middlesex County, at approximately .

Monroe Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 9, 1838, from portions of South Amboy Township, based on the results of a referendum held that same day. Portions of the township were taken to form East Brunswick (February 28, 1860), Cranbury (March 7, 1872), and Jamesburg (March 19, 1887).

There are several age-restricted communities in Monroe Township. Despite significant senior citizen population growth, the median age in Monroe has changed from 52.5 in 1990, increasing to 58.9 in 2000, before decreasing to 53.2 in 2010, as more growth recently has resulted from single-family detached homes than from senior citizen developments. Based upon analysis of data from the FBI&#x27;s Uniform Crime Reports for 2022 and 2023, Monroe Township was ranked as the safest small city in the United States.

==History==

The earliest settlers in what would become Monroe Township were the Lenape Native Americans. Monroe Township was founded in April 1838 and named in honor of the fifth President of the United States, James Monroe.

For many decades, the township area was largely a farming community. After parts of the township grew into the more densely populated neighborhoods of Helmetta, Jamesburg, and Spotswood in the late 19th century, they seceded. Railroads came into Monroe from just about the very beginning, starting with the Camden and Amboy Rail Road in the 1830s and 1840s.

In 1905, Bernarr Macfadden, the proponent of physical culture, came to the part of Monroe near Helmetta and Spotswood, and attempted to set up a camp called &quot;Physical Culture City&quot;, where he could teach his beliefs in relative peace. However, in 1907, Macfadden was arrested for distribution of pornography and the camp dissolved. The area of this camp became the Outcalt neighborhood.

The New Jersey State Home for Boys, later known as the Training School for Boys, and now the New Jersey Training School for Boys was established near Jamesburg. It was opened in 1867 as a home for troubled youth; however, by the mid-20th century, its purpose was to incarcerate juvenile delinquents. One of the better known residents of the State Home was Rubin &quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter. Clarence Clemons of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band was a counselor there for many years during the 1960s before he found fame as a saxophone player with Springsteen.

The township became more suburban between 1960 and 1968, when the New Jersey Turnpike opened up Exit 8A in the western part of Monroe, in conjunction with the effort to develop the Leisure World age-restricted community of Rossmoor. Since then, at least five more communities for senior citizens have joined Rossmoor: Concordia, Clearbrook, Greenbriar at Whittingham, The Ponds, Encore, Stonebridge, and the Regency at Monroe, with more under development. At the same time, and over the next few decades, suburban communities for people of all ages spread into the northern parts of Monroe Township, prompting the expansion of several schools and the construction of new ones. Since 1980, in addition to the age restricted communities, Monroe has added shopping centers, synagogues, a recreation center, and a new library.

Circa 1980, it was found that a landfill which was located at the corner of what is now Spotswood Gravel Hill Road and Carnegie Street, contaminated the ground water which forced Outcalt residents to get municipal-supplied water. The site had been run as a landfill for municipal waste since 1955, first by the township and later by an independent operator.

On March 22, 2006, ten residents of Monroe Township, from The Ponds retirement community, were killed in a tour bus accident in the Andes mountains in northern Chile. The tour had been arranged by Jewish organization B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith.
Since the early 2000s, Monroe has experienced a surge in residential development. New communities are being erected, usually around Route 33 and the New Jersey Turnpike. Portions of Monroe&#x27;s farmland are receiving commercial zoning. Roads have been widened to allow for the extra vehicular volume. Warehouses are being/have been constructed in the last few years along CR 535, located near the 8A toll gate. The northern section of the township is already developed, with developers heading further south in Monroe to start new communities. New adult communities have set ground in central Monroe, along Route 33 and on CR 615. While these new senior citizen housing units are being built, luxury homes are also being constructed.
There is an ongoing expansion of the Monroe Township High School that is relocating it onto portions of Thompson Park. This project slowly received approval after an archaeological study concluded that the land was not historically significant, except about of land. The controversy that led to the study involved a Lenape settlement, Bethel Indian Town, which protesters contended existed on the site, whereas supporters of the move of the high school claimed that Bethel Indian Town was a half-mile away. In late April 2008, construction started on the new high school, which then opened in September 2011. The old high school building is now being reused as the middle school.

By early 2008, the State Preservation Office and New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection gave full sanction to the de-accession of the land as a protected park. Ground breaking began immediately, only to be halted in June 2008 when additional remains were found. The consultant identified these stone foundation remains as a 19th-century farmstead, with no earlier association.

The township&#x27;s Route 33 Land Development Task Force is considering options for developing the area of land along Route 33 from the township&#x27;s border with East Windsor to Millstone Township.

This proposal would include the construction of new luxury houses, a new grocery store, a baseball park, a performing arts center, a bus stop, new restaurants, and new businesses.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
====Roads and highways====
, the township had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality, by Middlesex County and by the New Jersey Department of Transportation and by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority.

Major highways serving Monroe Township include the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95), Route 32 and Route 33. Exit 8A of the Turnpike is located on the western edge of Monroe Township, with a nine-lane toll gate featuring a &quot;modified&quot; double trumpet interchange (with a few ramps continuing into South Brunswick Township). A number of county routes pass through Monroe Township, including County Route 535, County Route 527, County Route 522, County Route 625, County Route 619, County Route 615, County Route 614, County Route 613 and County Route 612.

Other limited-access roads that are accessible outside the municipality include Interstate 195 in neighboring Millstone Township and the Garden State Parkway in bordering Old Bridge Township.

The New Jersey Turnpike Authority had proposed to build two roads that were to pass through Monroe. The first was the Driscoll Expressway which was to start from the Garden State Parkway at exit 80 in South Toms River and end north of exit 8A along the turnpike in South Brunswick. This project was terminated in the 1980s. The other was a west–east spur, Route 92. It would have started at U.S. Route 1 just north of the intersection with Ridge Road in the township of South Brunswick and ended at the Exit 8A toll gate in Monroe Township. However, this was cancelled on December 1, 2006, and the Authority instead focused on the Turnpike widening between Exit 6 and Exit 8A.

====Public transportation====
=====Rail=====
In the 19th &amp; 20th centuries, Jamesburg Borough and Monroe Township had a major railway in the area, which was the Freehold and Jamesburg Agricultural Railroad. This railway was owned and operated by the Camden &amp; Amboy Railroad Company (C&amp;A), in which surveying for the line began on September 8, 1851, grading began on October 19, 1852, and the first track was laid on April 4, 1853. The first section of line was opened on July 18, 1853. The establishment of the Freehold &amp; Jamesburg Agricultural Railroad caused this region to become a transportation hub. The Freehold and Jamesburg Railroad was abandoned by the early 1930s. A portion of the former railroad&#x27;s right-of-way was later approved to be sold by the New Jersey Board of Public Utility Commissioners (PUC) to Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Company in 1966, with occasional freight service still being utilized through the Freehold Industrial Track.

The Monmouth Ocean Middlesex Line is a proposal by New Jersey Transit to restore passenger railway service to the region, by utilizing the same tracks as the Freehold Industrial Track. Jamesburg would be a potential railway stop on the proposed &#x27;MOM&#x27; Line.

The nearest train stations to the Monroe area are located at Metuchen, New Brunswick, and Princeton Junction, all along on the Northeast Corridor Line.

=====Bus=====
NJ Transit currently provides bus service to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan on the 138 and 139 routes. Coach USA Suburban Transit and Academy Bus Lines provide weekday commuter service to PABT and to Wall Street.

Middlesex County Area Transit (MCAT) shuttles provide weekday service to and from Monroe on routes operating across the county.

<text>New Brunswick is a city in and the county seat of Middlesex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. A regional commercial hub for central New Jersey, the city is both a college town (the main campus of Rutgers University, the state&#x27;s largest university) and a commuter town for residents commuting to New York City within the New York metropolitan area. New Brunswick is on the Northeast Corridor rail line, southwest of Manhattan. The city is located on the southern banks of the Raritan River in the heart of the Raritan Valley region.

As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 55,266, an increase of 85 (+0.2%) from the 2010 census count of 55,181, which in turn reflected an increase of 6,608 (+13.6%) from the 48,573 counted in the 2000 census. The Census Bureau&#x27;s Population Estimates Program calculated a population of 55,846 for 2023, making it the 719th-most populous municipality in the nation. Due to the concentration of medical facilities in the area, including Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and medical school, and Saint Peter&#x27;s University Hospital, New Brunswick is known as both the &quot;Hub City&quot; and the &quot;Healthcare City&quot;. The corporate headquarters and production facilities of several global pharmaceutical companies are situated in the city, including Johnson &amp; Johnson and Bristol Myers Squibb. New Brunswick has evolved into a major center for the sciences, arts, and cultural activities. Downtown New Brunswick is developing a growing skyline, filling in with new high-rise towers.

New Brunswick is noted for its ethnic diversity. At one time, one-quarter of the Hungarian population of New Jersey resided in the city, and in the 1930s one out of three city residents was Hungarian. The Hungarian community continues as a cohesive community, with the 3,200 Hungarian residents accounting for 8% of the population of New Brunswick in 1992. Growing Asian and Hispanic communities have developed around French Street near Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital.

==History==

===Etymology===
The area around present-day New Brunswick was first inhabited by the Lenape Native Americans, whose Minisink Trail intersected the Raritan River and followed a route that would be taken by later colonial roads. The first European settlement at the site of New Brunswick was made in 1681. The settlement here was called &quot;Prigmore&#x27;s Swamp&quot; (1681–1697), then known as &quot;Inian&#x27;s Ferry&quot; (1691–1714). In 1714, the settlement was given the name New Brunswick, after the city of Braunschweig (&quot;Brunswick&quot; in Low German), in the state of Lower Saxony, now located in Germany. Braunschweig was an influential and powerful city in the Hanseatic League and was an administrative seat for the Duchy of Hanover. Shortly after the first settlement of New Brunswick in colonial New Jersey, George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and Elector of Hanover, became King George I of Great Britain. Alternatively, the city gets its name from King George II of Great Britain, the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg.

===Colonial and Early American periods===
Centrally located between New York City and Philadelphia along an early thoroughfare known as the &quot;King&#x27;s Highway&quot; and situated along the Raritan River, New Brunswick became an important hub for Colonial travelers and traders. New Brunswick was incorporated as a town in 1736 and chartered as a city in 1784. It was incorporated into a town in 1798 as part of the Township Act of 1798. It was occupied by the British in the winter of 1776–1777 during the Revolutionary War.

The &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot; received one of its first public readings, by Colonel John Neilson in New Brunswick on July 9, 1776, in the days following its promulgation by the Continental Congress. A bronze statue marking the event was dedicated on July 9, 2017, in Monument Square, in front of the Heldrich Hotel.

The Trustees of Queen&#x27;s College (now Rutgers University), founded in 1766, voted by a margin of ten to seven in 1771 to locate the young college in New Brunswick, selecting the city over Hackensack, in Bergen County, New Jersey. Classes began in 1771 with one instructor, one sophomore, Matthew Leydt, and several freshmen at a tavern called the &#x27;Sign of the Red Lion&#x27; on the corner of Albany and Neilson Streets (now the grounds of the Johnson &amp; Johnson corporate headquarters); Leydt would become the university&#x27;s first graduate in 1774 when he was the only member of the graduating class. The Sign of the Red Lion was purchased on behalf of Queens College in 1771, and later sold to the estate of Jacob Rutsen Hardenbergh in 1791. Classes were held through the American Revolution in various taverns and boarding houses, and at a building known as &quot;College Hall&quot; on George Street, until Old Queens was completed and opened in 1811. It remains the oldest building on the Rutgers University campus. The Queen&#x27;s College Grammar School (now Rutgers Preparatory School) was established also in 1766, and shared facilities with the college until 1830, when it located in a building (now known as Alexander Johnston Hall) across College Avenue from Old Queens. After Rutgers University became the state university of New Jersey in 1945, the Trustees of Rutgers divested itself of Rutgers Preparatory School, which relocated in 1957 to an estate purchased from Colgate-Palmolive in Franklin Township in neighboring Somerset County.

The New Brunswick Theological Seminary, founded in 1784 in New York, moved to New Brunswick in 1810, sharing its quarters with the fledgling Queen&#x27;s College. (Queen&#x27;s closed from 1810 to 1825 due to financial problems, and reopened in 1825 as Rutgers College.) The Seminary, due to overcrowding and differences over the mission of Rutgers College as a secular institution, moved to a tract of land covering located less than to the west, which it still occupies, although the land is now in the middle of Rutgers University&#x27;s College Avenue Campus.

New Brunswick was formed by royal charter on December 30, 1730, within other townships in Middlesex and Somerset counties and was reformed by royal charter with the same boundaries on February 12, 1763, at which time it was divided into north and south wards. New Brunswick was incorporated as a city by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on September 1, 1784.

===African-American community===

==== Slavery in New Brunswick ====
The existence of an African American community in New Brunswick dates back to the 18th century, when racial slavery was a part of life in the city and the surrounding area. Local slaveholders routinely bought and sold African American children, women, and men in New Brunswick in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century. In this period, the Market-House was the center of commercial life in the city. It was located at the corner of Hiram Street and Queen Street (now Neilson Street) adjacent to the Raritan Wharf. The site was a place where residents of New Brunswick sold and traded their goods which made it an integral part of the city&#x27;s economy. The Market-House also served as a site for regular slave auctions and sales.

By the late-eighteenth century, New Brunswick became a hub for newspaper production and distribution. &quot;The Fredonian&quot;, a popular newspaper, was located less than a block away from the aforementioned Market-House and helped facilitate commercial transactions. A prominent part of the local newspapers were sections dedicated to private owners who would advertise their slaves for sale. The trend of advertising slave sales in newspapers shows that the New Brunswick residents typically preferred selling and buying slaves privately and individually rather than in large groups. The majority of individual advertisements were for female slaves, and their average age at the time of the sale was 20 years old, which was considered the prime age for childbearing. Slave owners would get the most profit from the women who fit into this category because these women had the potential to reproduce another generation of enslaved workers. Additionally, in the urban environment of New Brunswick, there was a high demand for domestic labor, and female workers were preferred for cooking and housework tasks.

The New Jersey Legislature passed An Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery in 1804. Under the provisions of this law, children born to enslaved women after July 4, 1804, would serve their master for a term of 21 years (for girls) or a term of 25 years (for boys), and after this term, they would gain their freedom. However, all individuals who were enslaved before July 4, 1804, would continue to be slaves for life and would never attain freedom under this law. New Brunswick continued to be home to enslaved African Americans alongside a growing community of free people of color. The 1810 United States census listed 53 free Blacks and 164 slaves in New Brunswick.

==== African American spaces and institutions in the early 19th century ====
By the 1810s, some free African Americans lived in a section of the city called Halfpenny Town, which was located along the Raritan River by the east side of the city, near Queen (now Neilson) Street. Halfpenny Town was a place populated by free blacks as well as poorer whites who did not own slaves. This place was known as a social gathering for free blacks that was not completely influenced by white scrutiny and allowed free blacks to socialize among themselves. This does not mean that it was free from white eyes and was still under the negative effects of the slavery era. In the early decades of the nineteenth century, White and either free or enslaved African Americans shared many of the same spaces in New Brunswick, particularly places of worship. The First Presbyterian Church, Christ Church, and First Reformed Church were popular among both Whites and Blacks, and New Brunswick was notable for its lack of spaces where African Americans could congregate exclusively. Most of the time Black congregants of these churches were under the surveillance of Whites. That was the case until the creation of the African Association of New Brunswick in 1817.

Both free and enslaved African Americans were active in the establishment of the African Association of New Brunswick, whose meetings were first held in 1817. The African Association of New Brunswick held a meeting every month, mostly in the homes of free blacks. Sometimes these meetings were held at the First Presbyterian Church. Originally intended to provide financial support for the African School of New Brunswick, the African Association grew into a space where blacks could congregate and share ideas on a variety of topics such as religion, abolition and colonization. Slaves were required to obtain a pass from their owner in order to attend these meetings. The African Association worked closely with Whites and was generally favored amongst White residents who believed it would bring more racial peace and harmony to New Brunswick.

The African Association of New Brunswick established the African School in 1822. The African School was first hosted in the home of Caesar Rappleyea in 1823. The school was located on the upper end of Church Street in the downtown area of New Brunswick about two blocks away from the jail that held escaped slaves. Both free and enslaved Blacks were welcome to be members of the School. Reverend Huntington (pastor of the First Presbyterian Church) and several other prominent Whites were trustees of the African Association of New Brunswick. These trustees supported the Association which made some slave owners feel safe sending their slaves there by using a permission slip process. The main belief of these White supporters was that Blacks were still unfit for American citizenship and residence, and some trustees were connected with the American Colonization Society that advocated for the migration of free African Americans to Africa. The White trustees only attended some of the meetings of the African Association, and the Association was still unprecedented as a space for both enslaved and free Blacks to get together while under minimal supervision by Whites.

The African Association appears to have disbanded after 1824. By 1827, free and enslaved Black people in the city, including Joseph and Jane Hoagland, came together to establish the Mount Zion African Methodist Episcopal Church and purchased a plot of land on Division Street for the purpose of erecting a church building. This was the first African American church in Middlesex County. The church had approximately 30 members in its early years. The church is still in operation and is currently located at 39 Hildebrand Way. The street Hildebrand Way is named after the late Rev. Henry Alphonso Hildebrand, who was pastor of Mount Zion AME for 37 years, which is the longest appointment received by a pastor at Mount Zion AME.

Records from the April 1828 census, conducted by the New Brunswick Common Council, state that New Brunswick was populated with 4,435 white residents and 374 free African Americans. The enslaved population of New Brunswick in 1828 consisted of 57 slaves who must serve for life and 127 slaves eligible for emancipation at age 21 or 25 due to the 1804 Act for the Gradual Abolition of Slavery. Free and enslaved African Americans accounted for 11% of New Brunswick&#x27;s population in 1828, a relatively high percentage for New Jersey. By comparison, as of the 1830 United States census, African Americans made up approximately 6.4% of the total population of New Jersey.

==== Jail and curfew in the 19th century ====
In 1824, the New Brunswick Common Council adopted a curfew for free people of color. Free African Americans were not allowed to be out after 10 pm on Saturday night. The Common Council also appointed a committee of white residents who were charged with rounding up and detaining free African Americans who appeared to be out of place according to white authorities.

New Brunswick became a notorious city for slave hunters, who sought to enforce the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. Strategically located on the Raritan River, the city was also a vital hub for New Jersey&#x27;s Underground Railroad. For runaway slaves in New Jersey, it served as a favorable route for those heading to New York and Canada. When African Americans tried to escape either to or from New Brunswick, they had a high likelihood of getting discovered and captured and sent to New Brunswick&#x27;s jail, which was located on Prince Street, which by now is renamed Bayard Street.

===Hungarian community===
New Brunswick has been described as the nation&#x27;s &quot;most Hungarian city&quot;, with Hungarian immigrants arriving in the city as early as 1888 and accounting for almost 20% of the city&#x27;s population in 1915. Hungarians were primarily attracted to the city by employment at Johnson &amp; Johnson factories located in the city. Hungarians settled mainly in what today is the Fifth Ward and businesses were established to serve the needs of the Hungarian community that weren&#x27;t being met by mainstream businesses. The immigrant population grew until the end of the immigration boom in the early 20th century.

During the Cold War, the community was revitalized by the decision to process the tens of thousands refugees who came to the United States from the failed 1956 Hungarian Revolution at Camp Kilmer, in nearby Edison. Even though the Hungarian population has been largely supplanted by newer immigrants, there continues to be a Hungarian Festival in the city held on Somerset Street on the first Saturday of June each year; the 44th annual event was held in 2019. Many Hungarian institutions set up by the community remain and are active in the neighborhood, including: Magyar Reformed Church, Ascension Lutheran Church, St. Ladislaus Roman Catholic Church, St. Joseph Byzantine Catholic Church, Hungarian American Athletic Club, Aprokfalva Montessori Preschool, Széchenyi Hungarian Community School &amp; Kindergarten, Teleki Pál Scout Home, Hungarian American Foundation, Vers Hangja, Hungarian Poetry Group, Bolyai Lecture Series on Arts and Sciences, Hungarian Alumni Association, Hungarian Radio Program, Hungarian Civic Association, Committee of Hungarian Churches and Organizations of New Brunswick, and Csűrdöngölő Folk Dance Ensemble.

Several landmarks in the city also testify to its Hungarian heritage. There is a street and a park named after Lajos Kossuth, one of the leaders of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. The corner of Somerset Street and Plum Street is named Mindszenty Square where the first ever statue of Cardinal József Mindszenty was erected. A stone memorial to the victims of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution stands nearby.

===Latino community===
In the 2010 Census, about 50% of New Brunswick&#x27;s population is self-identified as Hispanic, the 14th highest percentage among municipalities in New Jersey. Since the 1960s, many of the new residents of New Brunswick have come from Latin America. Many citizens moved from Puerto Rico in the 1970s. In the 1980s, many immigrated from the Dominican Republic, and still later from Guatemala, Honduras, Ecuador and Mexico.

===Demolition, revitalization, and redevelopment===
New Brunswick is one of nine cities in New Jersey designated as eligible for Urban Transit Hub Tax Credits by the state&#x27;s Economic Development Authority. Developers who invest a minimum of $50 million within a half-mile of a train station are eligible for pro-rated tax credit.

New Brunswick contains a number of examples of urban renewal in the United States. In the 1960s–1970s, the downtown area experienced urban decay as middle class residents moved to newer suburbs surrounding the city, an example of the phenomenon known as &quot;white flight.&quot; Beginning in 1975, Rutgers University, Johnson &amp; Johnson and the city&#x27;s government collaborated through the New Jersey Economic Development Authority to form the New Brunswick Development Company (DevCo), with the goal of revitalizing the city center and redeveloping neighborhoods considered to be blighted and dangerous (via demolition of existing buildings and construction of new ones). Johnson &amp; Johnson announced in 1978 that they would remain in New Brunswick and invest $50 million to build a new world headquarters building in the area between Albany Street, Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor, Route 18, and George Street, requiring many old buildings and historic roads to be removed. The Hiram Market area, a historic district that by the 1970s had become a mostly Puerto Rican and Dominican-American neighborhood, was demolished to build a Hyatt hotel and conference center, and upscale housing. Johnson &amp; Johnson guaranteed the investment made by Hyatt Hotels, as they were wary of building an upscale hotel in a run-down area.

Devco, the hospitals, and the city government have drawn ire from both historic preservationists, those opposing gentrification and those concerned with eminent domain abuses and tax abatements for developers.

New Brunswick is home to the main campus of Rutgers University and Johnson &amp; Johnson, which in 1983 constructed its new headquarters in the city. Both work with Devco in a public–private partnership to redevelop downtown, particularly regarding transit-oriented development. Boraie Development, a real estate development firm based in New Brunswick, has developed projects using the incentives provided by Devco and the state.


====Tallest buildings====

Christ Church, originally built in 1742, was the tallest building at the time of construction. A steeple was added in 1773 and replaced in 1803. The six-story First Reformed Church, built in 1812, was long the city&#x27;s tallest structure.

<text>Old Bridge Township is a township in Middlesex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, located in the Raritan Valley region and within the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the township was the state&#x27;s 21st-most-populous municipality, with a population of 66,876, an increase of 1,501 (+2.3%) from the 2010 census count of 65,375, which in turn reflected an increase of 4,919 (+8.1%) from the 60,456 counted in the 2000 census. As of the 2010 Census, the township was ranked 18th in the state by population, after being the state&#x27;s 21st most-populous municipality in 2000. The township is a bedroom suburb of New York City located across the Raritan Bay from Staten Island. It is about from Manhattan and about south of Newark.

What is now Old Bridge Township was originally incorporated as Madison Township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 2, 1869, from portions of South Amboy Township (now City of South Amboy). In a referendum held on November 5, 1975, voters approved changing the township&#x27;s name to Old Bridge Township by a margin of 7,150 votes to 4,888. The township&#x27;s name was changed to avoid confusion with the borough of Madison in Morris County. When the township was established, the area was made up primarily of farms and the population grew slowly. In 1880, the population was 1,662 and by 1950 it had reached 7,365. Over the next decade, a building boom started; as farms gave way to developments, the population tripled to 22,772 by 1960. The 1980 census cited 51,406 people. The township saw major changes with the extension of Route 18 to the shore.

The township was named as a contender for the title of one of the best places to live in the United States by &quot;Money&quot; magazine in both 2005 and 2007.

In 2016, SafeWise named Old Bridge Township as the sixth-safest city in America to raise a child; the township was the second-highest ranked of the 12 communities in New Jersey included on the list.

== History ==
The first inhabitants of the area known as Old Bridge were the Lenni Lenape Native Americans. Those who settled in Old Bridge and other parts of Central Jersey were known as the Unami, or &quot;people down the river.&quot; They migrated to the shore along the Raritan each summer from their hunting grounds in the north. When the English gained control from the Dutch in 1664, the state was divided into two provinces, East Jersey and West Jersey. In 1683, the general assembly of East Jersey defined the boundaries of Middlesex County and the three other original counties (Bergen, Essex and Monmouth) as containing all plantations on both sides of the Raritan River, as far as Cheesequake Harbor to the east, then southwest to the Provincial line, with the southwest line being the border of Monmouth and Middlesex counties and the Township&#x27;s southern border.

Thomas Warne, one of the original 24 proprietors of East Jersey, was listed as a landowner of this area, and his son is said to have been the earliest European resident residing in the Cheesequake area in 1683. John and Susannah Brown were granted a land grant from the King of England in 1737. They called the area Brownville, and this part of township is still known as Browntown.

In 1684, South Amboy Township was formed. At that time, it covered an area that now consists of the Townships of Monroe and Old Bridge, the Borough of Sayreville and the City of South Amboy. The Township covers that separated from South Amboy on March 2, 1869, and was originally called Madison Township. In 1975, the name was changed by referendum to the Township of Old Bridge. The purpose was to establish a single postal designation and ZIP code for the township and to differentiate the township from the Borough of Madison in Morris County. The community of Old Bridge in East Brunswick derives its name from the fact that the first bridge spanning the South River was built there, and as other bridges were built across the river the first one became known as &quot;the Old Bridge.&quot;

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 40.93 square miles (106.00 km2), including 38.18 square miles (98.89 km2) of land and 2.75 square miles (7.11 km2) of water (6.71%).

Other unincorporated communities, localities and place names within Old Bridge Township include Browntown, Brunswick Gardens, Cheesequake, Cottrell Corners, Matchaponix, Moerls Corner, Morristown, Parlin, Redshaw Corner, Runyon, Sayre Woods South, South Old Bridge and Texas.

==Economy==

===Old mill streams===
Madison Township had many mill streams that were used to generate water power. The Warne family owned fulling mills in the area. Fulling was used as a finishing process used on woolen cloth that would remove the dirt and grease and to compact the wool fibers. The mill is said to have been run behind Old Bridge High School and flows east into the Matawan Creek. The area of Old Bridge was also known for its many mills that manufactured snuff, a scented tobacco product that was used by men and women during that time. The Washington Snuff mill (later renamed the Dill Snuff Mill) was established in 1801 and was located on Mount Pleasant and Old Bridge Turnpike (now Route 516).

===Clay industry===
The clay soil in the area surrounding Old Bridge was used for pottery and bricks way before the first European settlers. &quot;Fine clay had surrounded Cheesequake Creek when the Lenni Lenape Native Americans lived there. The early discoveries of clay along the banks opened the clay industry to Middlesex County as well as the state of New Jersey. By the 1800s clay was a major industry. The clay deposits found along Cheesequake Creek are reported to be some of the finest stoneware clays in the United States.&quot; The clay supplied local potters as well as those in Hudson Valley, Norwalk, Connecticut, other New England states, and parts of Canada. The earliest use of clay from this area was used by Captain James Morgan before the Revolution. The Perrine clay pit was located near U.S. Route 9 and Ernston Road.

===Apple farms===
The Cottrell homestead is a landmark in Old Bridge. It was built in 1831 and still stands today on the northeast corner of County Route 516 and Cottrell Road. The Cottrells owned a apple orchard that was located across the street from their home. Apples that could not be used because of their size or quality did not go to waste. Across from the cold-storage building on the southwest corner of Cottrell Road and Route 516, the family built the New Jersey Apple Growers Inc. distillery. It was at this distillery that they pressed the apples into cider and distilled the brandy in large vats. The brandy would age in barrels in a government warehouse that was located on the Cottrells&#x27; property. The Cottrells produced apple brandy for twenty years on the farm and sold it wholesale to distributors under the name Browntown.

== Government ==

=== Local government ===
Old Bridge Township is governed within the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under the Mayor-Council system of municipal government. The township is one of 71 municipalities (of the 564) statewide governed under this form. The Township Council is comprised of nine members, with six elected to represent wards and three elected at-large from the township as a whole in partisan elections held as part of the November general election in odd-numbered years. All elected officials serve four-year terms of office on a staggered basis, with the six ward seats up for election together and the three at-large seats and the mayoral seat up for vote together two years later.

, the Mayor of Old Bridge Township is Republican Eleanor &quot;Debbie&quot; Walker, whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. The members of the Township Council are Council President Mary Rita Sohor (R, 2027; At Large), Council Vice-President Anita Greenberg-Belli (R, 2027; At-Large), Darin Accettulli (R, 2025; Ward 2 - appointed to serve an unexpired term), Jill DeCaro (D, 2025; Ward 4), Erik DePalma (R, 2027; At Large), Kiran Desai (D, 2025; Ward 3), Kevin J. Garcia (R, 2025; Ward 1), John E. Murphy III (R, 2025; Ward 6), Anthony Paskitti (R, 2025; Ward 5).

Darin Accettulli was appointed to fill the Wars 2 seat expiring in December 2025 that had been held by Erik DePalma, until he took office as an at-large councilmember. Accettulli will serve on an interim basis until the November 2024 general election, when voters will choose a candidate to serve the balance of the term of office.

Republican Mark Razzoli had been behind Democrat Jill DeCaro by 11 votes at the November 2021 general election for the seat in Ward 4. In December 2021, the results were invalidated after it was confirmed that dozens of residents had received incorrect ballots that had voters casting ballots in the incorrect ward. In a March 2022 special election, DeCaro was elected over Razzoli by an 838 to 693 margin.

In January 2020, the Township Council selected Erik DePalma from a list of three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the Second Ward seat expiring in December 2021 that became vacant when Mary Sohor resigned to take office after taking office to an at-large seat.

In June 2016, the Township Council appointed June Dungee to fill the vacant Third Ward seat expiring in December 2017 that had been held by Reginald Butler until his death earlier that month; Dungee served until the November 2016 general election, when voters choose a candidate to serve the balance of the term of office.

<doc id="125436" wikidata="Q985592" url="?curid=125436" title="Perth Amboy, New Jersey">
<text>Perth Amboy is a city in northeastern Middlesex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, within the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 55,436. Perth Amboy is known as the &quot;City by the Bay&quot;, referring to its location adjoining Raritan Bay.

The earliest residents of the area were the Lenape Native Americans, who called the point on which the city lies &quot;Ompoge&quot;. Perth Amboy was settled in 1683 by Scottish colonists and was called &quot;New Perth&quot; after James Drummond, 4th Earl of Perth; the native name was eventually corrupted and the two names were merged. Perth Amboy was formed by Royal charter in 1718, and the New Jersey Legislature reaffirmed its status in 1784, after independence. The city was a capital of the Province of New Jersey from 1686 to 1776. During the mid-1800s, the Industrial Revolution and immigration grew the city, developing a variety of neighborhoods which residents from a diverse range of ethnicities lived in. The city developed into a resort town for the Raritan Bayshore near it, but the city has grown in other industries since its redevelopment starting in the 1990s. Its residents are mostly Hispanic.

Perth Amboy borders the Arthur Kill and features a historic waterfront. The Perth Amboy Ferry Slip was once an important ferry slip on the route south from New York City; it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The Raritan Yacht Club, one of the oldest yacht clubs in the United States, is located in the city. Perth Amboy is connected to the Staten Island borough of New York City via the Outerbridge Crossing.

==History==
===Name===
The Lenape Native Americans called the point on which the city is built &quot;Ompoge&quot;, meaning &quot;level ground&quot; or &quot;standing or upright&quot;. When settled in 1683, the new city was dubbed &quot;New Perth&quot; in honor of James Drummond, Earl of Perth, one of the 12 associates of a company of Scottish proprietors; Drummond has been honored with a statue located outside of city hall. The Algonquian language name persisted, corrupted to Ambo, or Point Amboy, and eventually a combination of the native and colonial names emerged, also appearing in South Amboy.

===Scottish colony===
Perth Amboy was settled by Scottish colonists around 1683 who had been recruited to inhabit the share of the East Jersey colony owned by Robert Barclay, a Quaker who would later become the absentee governor of the province.

===Charter and incorporation===
Perth Amboy was formed by Royal charter on August 4, 1718, within various townships and again by the New Jersey Legislature on December 21, 1784, within Perth Amboy Township and from part of Woodbridge Township. Perth Amboy Township was formed on October 31, 1693, and was enlarged during the 1720s to encompass Perth Amboy city. Perth Amboy Township was incorporated as one of New Jersey&#x27;s initial 104 townships through the Township Act of 1798 on February 21, 1798. The township was replaced by Perth Amboy city on April 8, 1844.

===Provincial capital===

Elizabeth (then known as Elizabethtown) was designated in 1668 as the first capital of New Jersey. In 1686, Perth Amboy was designated as the capital of East Jersey, while Burlington was the capital of West Jersey. After the two were united as a royal colony in 1702, the two cities alternated as the capital of the Province of New Jersey until November 1790, when Trenton was designated as the unified state capital, chosen based on its location midway between New York City and Philadelphia.

A few of the buildings from this early period can still be seen today. Most notably, the Proprietary House, the home of William Franklin, the last Royal Governor of New Jersey and estranged son of Benjamin Franklin, still stands in the waterfront area of the city. Architect John Edward Pryor was hired in 1761 to design and construct the building, which was completed in September 1764, years late and over budget. Franklin preferred his alternate home in Burlington. Franklin finally moved in 1774 into the Proprietary House. Franklin&#x27;s father, Ben, tried unsuccessfully to convince his son to support the Colonial cause. William Franklin was arrested and detained at Proprietary House in 1776 until he was tried and convicted of treason.

Perth Amboy City Hall was first built as a court house for Middlesex County in 1714, having been designated as the county seat the previous year. The building was later used as the home of the East Jersey Provincial Assembly. The building was destroyed by a major fire in 1731 and rebuilt in 1745. Another fire was deliberately set in 1764, forcing a rebuilding that was completed in 1767. It is the oldest city hall in continuous use in the United States. On November 20, 1789, City Hall was the site where the New Jersey General Assembly met to ratify the Bill of Rights, becoming the first state in the nation to do so.
Market Square, located across from City Hall, is a park that had been an outdoor marketplace during the Colonial era. Market Square includes a replica of the Liberty Bell, a statue of George Washington, and the Bill of Rights Arch, which commemorates the fact that New Jersey was the first state to ratify the Bill of Rights.

St. Peter&#x27;s Church, which held its first service in 1685 and received a royal charter in 1718, has been recognized as the first Episcopal congregation in the state. Its current building, dating from the 1850s, is surrounded by a graveyard of early inhabitants and displays a collection of stained-glass windows with religious scenes as well as early depictions of New Jersey receiving her charter and a meeting between William Franklin and his father, Ben.

Perth Amboy was New Jersey&#x27;s primary inbound port for African slaves.

The Kearny Cottage is a remaining example of 18th-century vernacular architecture. Operated as a historic house museum and operated by the Kearny Cottage Historical Society. Built in 1781 on High Street, the house was moved to Sadowski Parkway in the 1920s, and was later relocated to its current site at 63 Catalpa Avenue, just inland from the mouth of the Raritan River.

During the colonial period and for a significant time thereafter, Perth Amboy was an important way-station for travelers between New York City and Philadelphia, as it was the site of a ferry that crossed the Arthur Kill to Tottenville, Staten Island. The first ferry operated in 1684 and regular service began operating in 1709. This ferry became less important when the Outerbridge Crossing opened in 1928, but continued to operate until 1963. In 1998, the Perth Amboy Ferry Slip was restored to its 1904 appearance. A replica of the ticket office has been constructed and is used as a small museum.

On March 31, 1870, Thomas Mundy Peterson became the first African-American in the United States to vote in an election under the recently enacted provisions of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Peterson voted in an election to update the Perth Amboy city charter.

===Industrialization and immigration===

By the middle of the 19th century, immigration and industrialization transformed Perth Amboy. Factories such as A. Hall and Sons Terra Cotta, Guggenheim and Sons and the Copper Works Smelting Company fueled a thriving downtown and employed many area residents. Growth was further stimulated by becoming the tidewater terminal for the Lehigh Valley Railroad and a coal shipping point. Perth Amboy developed tightly-knit and insular ethnic neighborhoods such as Budapest, Dublin, and Chickentown. Immigrants from Denmark, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Russia, and Austria quickly dominated the factory jobs.

In 1903, the Perth Amboy Public Library, one of the first Carnegie libraries in the state, made possible through grants from Andrew Carnegie and donations by local philanthropists, opened to the public.

In 1914, Perth Amboy hosted a minor league baseball team called the Perth Amboy Pacers, who played as members of the Class D level Atlantic League. The Atlantic League folded after one season.

In late August 1923, an estimated 6,000 persons rioted, breaking through police lines after the Ku Klux Klan attempted to organize a meeting in the city.

The city was a resort town in the 19th century and early 20th century, located on the northern edge of the Raritan Bayshore. Since the early 1990s Perth Amboy has seen redevelopment. Small businesses have started to open up, helped by the city&#x27;s designation as an Urban Enterprise Zone. The waterfront has also seen a rebirth. The marina has been extended, and there are new promenades, parks, and housing overlooking the bay.

The chapter &quot;More Alarms at Night&quot; in humorist James Thurber&#x27;s biography &quot;My Life and Hard Times&quot; involves Perth Amboy. One night during his adolescence in Ohio, young Thurber is unable to go to sleep because he cannot remember the name of this New Jersey community. He wakens his father, demanding that he start naming towns in New Jersey. When the startled father names several towns with single-word names, Thurber replies that the name he is seeking is &quot;two words, like helter skelter&quot;. This convinces his father that Thurber has become dangerously insane. Thurber also wrote the story later made into the film &quot;The Secret Life of Walter Mitty&quot;, about an &quot;inconsequential guy from Perth Amboy, New Jersey&quot;. Perth Amboy&#x27;s water pumping station is located in Old Bridge Township.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 5.93 square miles (15.36 km2), including 4.66 square miles (12.07 km2) of land and 1.27 square miles (3.28 km2) of water (21.37%).

Perth Amboy, and South Amboy across the Raritan River, are collectively referred to as The Amboys. Signage for Exit 11 on the New Jersey Turnpike refers to &quot;The Amboys&quot; as a destination. The Amboys are the northern limit of the area informally referred to as the Bayshore.

Perth Amboy borders Woodbridge (adjacent by land to the north and west), Sayreville (to the southwest, across the Raritan River), South Amboy (south across the upper reaches of Raritan Bay, directly connected only by rail), and the New York City borough of Staten Island (east across the Arthur Kill).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the city include Barber, Eagleswood and Florida Grove.

Perth Amboy sits on a geological layer of clay several hundred feet thick. Consequently, clay mining and factories such as A. Hall and Sons Terra Cotta located in Perth Amboy in the late 19th century.

In its September 2005 issue, &quot;Golf Magazine&quot; named Perth Amboy the unofficial &quot;Golf Capital of the U.S.&quot;, despite the fact that there are no golf courses within the city limits, citing the city&#x27;s access to 25 of the magazine&#x27;s Top 100 Golf Courses in the U.S., which can be found within of Perth Amboy.


===Waterfront===
Perth Amboy features a historic waterfront, which has gone through significant revitalization. Local attractions include the Perth Amboy Ferry Slip, two small museums, an art gallery, a yacht club, and a marina. Near the marina lies a park with a small bandshell. On Sunday afternoons in the summertime, Perth Amboy hosts the Concerts by the Bay in the park&#x27;s bandshell. Every Thursday evening in the summer, Perth Amboy hosts the Mayor&#x27;s Concert Series in Bayview Park. Perth Amboy also hosts an annual Waterfront Arts Festival. The waterfront is also characterized by a redbrick promenade near the water and many stately Victorian homes, some on hills overlooking the bay and tree lined streets with well-manicured lawns. The land rises steeply after two blocks. This hides the rest of the town, making the waterfront look like a quiet fishing village. Points of interest on the waterfront include St. Peter&#x27;s Episcopal Church, and the Proprietary House, which is now the former governor&#x27;s mansion and houses a museum and some offices. Kearny Cottage, which also has a museum, is here. This section of Perth Amboy once had a thriving Jewish community with yeshivas, synagogues, kosher butchers and bakers. Today, however, there are only two synagogues left, each with only a few older members.

A project called &#x27;The Landings at Harborside&#x27; was to have featured 2,100 residential units along with indoor parking, of retail space, a community center, and recreation amenities for the public as well. However, after meeting with Charles Kushner, the developer who spent two years in prison after being convicted of witness tampering, tax evasion and making illegal campaign contributions, Mayor Wilda Diaz endorsed a scaled-back design concept for the development, allowing Section 8 housing rentals instead of owner-occupied units as originally promised.

The Raritan Yacht Club is the state&#x27;s second-oldest and one of the oldest yacht clubs in the United States, founded in 1882 from the merger of two older clubs, one founded in 1865 and the other in 1874. Also located on the waterfront and founded in 1917, St. Demetrios was one of the first Greek Orthodox churches in central New Jersey. Established by the Greek immigrants who came to the United States at the turn of the 19th century, this community has stood as a beacon of the Orthodox Faith and Hellenism in Middlesex County.

===Downtown Perth Amboy===

Perth Amboy was settled by Europeans in 1683 and incorporated as a city in 1718. It was founded by English merchants, Scots seeking religious freedom, and French Protestants, who sought to make use of Perth Amboy&#x27;s harbor to its full potential. Downtown is the main commercial district, and is centered on Smith Street. It is an Urban Enterprise Zone, and the reduced sales tax rate (half of the statewide rate) funds revitalization of Smith Street with newly planted trees, Victorian streetlights, benches, garbage cans, and redbrick sidewalks. Smith Street is a shopping center seven blocks wide, with stores catering to working-class customers. The street is flanked by mainly two- to three-story buildings of varied architecture. It also has a lone bank skyscraper called &#x27;Amboy Towers&#x27;, 10 stories tall, located at Five Corners, the intersection of Smith Street, New Brunswick Avenue and State Street. Once home to several department stores downtown, the largest storefront today is a discount retailer.

===Harbortown===
Harbortown is a townhouse development on the waterfront which continues to be expanded since construction started in 1987. &quot;Section 8&quot; housing along with more affluent homes can be found in Harbortown, an economically and ethnically diverse townhouse development in the city.

This area was the Lehigh Valley Railroad marshaling yards where coal was loaded onto barges for shipment to New York City and elsewhere until the LVRR went bankrupt in 1976.

===Hall Avenue===
Hall Avenue is a neighborhood centered on Hall Avenue east of the NJ Transit train tracks. The street itself, Hall Avenue, is no longer the commercial strip it once was. However, there is a recently built strip mall on the corner of Hall Avenue and State Street called the &quot;Firehouse Plaza&quot;. There is also a &quot;Banco Popular&quot; branch of the bank headquartered in Puerto Rico. However, Hall Avenue is now primarily residential. Most of the homes are aging apartments, but there are also some newly constructed homes. Hall Avenue remains a traditional Puerto Rican neighborhood, and it hosts the city&#x27;s annual Puerto Rican Day Festival, which is held on the same day of the historic Puerto Rican Day Parade in New York City. Rudyk Park is north of Route 440 and features the Roberto Clemente Baseball Field and an industrial park.

===Southwestern section===
The southwestern section is a mainly working-class residential neighborhood with some light industry, once the site of Eagleswood Military Academy. The city&#x27;s largest strip mall is located here. This neighborhood has a large and diversified Hispanic neighborhood with many Dominicans, Puerto Ricans, and recently, South Americans. Much of the city&#x27;s Mexican population also lives in this section. Previously, this section of Perth Amboy had a large Irish population and was once named &quot;Dublin&quot;. Following the Irish came the Eastern Europeans, primarily Polish and Hungarian. Most of the housing consists of small one- or two-family houses. The main commercial strip is Smith Street, west of the NJ Transit train tracks.

===Western section===
The western section of the waterfront is west of Kearny Avenue. It is an overwhelmingly blue-collar Hispanic neighborhood. Most of the homes are over 100 years old; many are modest row houses. Sadowski Parkway Park lines through the southern end of the neighborhood and has a walkway with a beach. The park also hosts the Dominican festival and other festivals during the summer.

===State Street===

State Street is a neighborhood east of the NJ Transit train tracks, north of Fayette Street, and south of Harbortown. Like the southwestern section of Perth Amboy, it is predominantly working-class Hispanic. In addition, this neighborhood had many industries and factories before they moved overseas. The neighborhood is mainly Caribbean Hispanic. This section once had a large Cuban community. The State and Fayette Gardens, an apartment complex in the neighborhood, were called &quot;The Cuban Buildings&quot; at one time. The Landings at Harborside redevelopment project is being constructed in this neighborhood.

===Amboy Avenue===
Amboy Avenue is a quasi-suburban, working to middle-class neighborhood. It is also referred to as the &quot;Hospital section&quot; or the &quot;High School section&quot; due to the fact that these places are located in the neighborhood. Today most residents are Hispanic; Amboy Avenue once had a strong Italian population.

===Maurer===
Maurer is a chiefly working to middle-class neighborhood that lies in the northern part of Route 440. It is heavily industrial with many oil refineries and brownfields. Like Amboy Avenue, it is quasi-suburban.

===Chickentown===
Chickentown is a neighborhood in the western part of Route 35 south of Spa Springs, just south of Route 440. It shares many of the same characteristics of Spa Springs but to a lesser extent. The city&#x27;s largest park, Washington Park, is located here. It received its name from all the chicken farms (hens and eggs) that were located here before World War II.

==Climate==
Perth Amboy has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) typical of New Jersey with hot, humid summers and cold, wet winters.

==Demographics==

The city is one of many U.S. communities with a majority Hispanic population.

As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 60,804, an increase of 4,760 (+8.5%) from the 2010 census count of 56,044, which in turn reflected an increase of 5,562 (+11.0%) from 50,482 at the 2000 census.

The name may be derived from the area&#x27;s earliest European settlers who came from near the Piscataqua River, a landmark defining the coastal border between New Hampshire and Maine, whose name derives from (branch) and (tidal river), or alternatively from (meaning &quot;dark night&quot;) and (&quot;place of&quot;) or from a Lenape language word meaning &quot;great deer&quot;. The area was appropriated in 1666 by Quakers and Baptists who had left the Puritan colony in New Hampshire.

Piscataway Township was formed on December 17, 1666, and officially incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798, as part of the state&#x27;s initial group of 104 townships. The community, the fifth-oldest municipality in New Jersey, has grown from Native American territory, through a colonial period and is one of the links in the earliest settlement of the Atlantic Ocean seacoast that ultimately led to the formation of the United States. Over the years, portions of Piscataway were taken to form Raritan Township (March 17, 1870, now Edison), Dunellen (October 28, 1887), Middlesex (April 9, 1913) and South Plainfield (March 10, 1926).

Rutgers University&#x27;s main campus spills into the township. SHI Stadium, home field for the Rutgers Scarlet Knights football team, is in Piscataway as well as part of the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.

==History==

The earliest settlers of the area were the Lenape Native Americans; a group of four European settlers coming from New Hampshire acquired of land in 1666 that had been occupied by Native Americans.
In 1666, the first proprietary Governor of the Province of New Jersey, Philip Carteret, granted 12 new settlers from Massachusetts a 100 square mile allotment of land that was later founded as the townships of Piscataway and Woodbridge. Similar types of settlements established by religious dissenters fleeing Puritan colonies in New England were being formed in other parts of New Jersey, notably the Elizabethtown Tract in Northern New Jersey near the mouth of the Raritan River and extending upwards into modern day Essex County, and the Monmouth Tract in Central New Jersey near the Raritan Bay and extending southward along the Jersey Shore to the Barnegat Inlet.

Additional settlers from the Piscataqua River area of New Hampshire moved to Piscataway, bringing the name. Coming from a lumbering, shipbuilding and fishing background, these settlers, consisting of mostly Baptists and Quakers, were comfortable with their new surroundings, and looking forward to starting a new life away from political and religious persecution in the north. They were also enterprising and pioneering families who were already experienced in wilderness settlement. Before the original settlers, there were pioneer scouts who surveyed these new lands and waterways. The town name of Piscataway came from these early pioneers who originally came from the town of Piscataqua. During the original land purchase, the pioneers had signed 12 Articles of Agreement with Governor Carteret, which served as the legal basis for the government of Piscataway and Woodbridge and which shaped the democratic development of self-government. In short, these articles were mainly designed to provide liberty and land ownership for new families and to allow them to establish their own government representatives and religious freedoms.

After a few line and boundary changes, Piscataway and its outer plantations were reported to total 40,000 acres, with 66 square miles of land in 1685. The Lenape Native Americans occupied the entire Piscataway area, but were dispelled as the encroachment of European settlers increased. Across multiple generations, the Lenape established defined trails that European settlers appropriated in order to traverse through the wilderness area and partition new lands. Over time, many of these primitive trails became the main routes of travel between communities and became the basis of roads that still exist today. The trails along the Raritan River were named after a local population of Native Americans called the Raritangs. Piscataway Township is the fifth-oldest municipality in New Jersey and among the fifty oldest municipalities in the United States.

On February 8, 1777, the Battle of Quibbletown, a running battle took place between approximately 2,000 British and Hessian troops under the command of British General Charles Lord Cornwallis and the local patriot militia led by Colonel Charles Scott and a separate militia commanded by Brigadier General Nathaniel Warner.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 18.96 square miles (49.11 km2), including 18.79 square miles (48.68 km2) of land and 0.17 square miles (0.43 km2) of water (0.88%).

The township lies on the south side of the Raritan Valley, a line of cities in Central Jersey, along with New Brunswick, Highland Park and South Plainfield. Piscataway is 45 minutes southwest of New York City and 53 minutes northeast of Philadelphia.

Piscataway is bordered by nine municipalities: Dunellen, Edison, Highland Park, Middlesex, New Brunswick and South Plainfield in Middlesex County; Franklin Township and South Bound Brook in Somerset County; and Plainfield in Union County.

Society Hill (with a 2010 Census population of 3,829) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located within Piscataway Township.

Piscataway is often segmented by local residents into unincorporated communities, localities and place names which include Arbor, Bound Brook Heights (&quot;the Heights&quot;), Fellowship Farm, Fieldville, Johnson Park, Lake Nelson, New Brunswick Highlands, New Market (known as Quibbletown in the 18th Century), Newtown, North Stelton, Possumtown, Randolphville, Raritan Landing and Riverview Manor. The original settlement of Piscatawaytown is located in present-day Edison.

Camp Kilmer, constructed starting in 1941 on of Piscataway and Edison, was activated in June 1942 by the United States Army as a staging area and part of an installation of the New York Port of Embarkation. Troops were quartered at Camp Kilmer in preparation for transport to the European Theater of Operations in World War II, ultimately becoming the largest processing center for troops heading overseas and returning from World War II, processing over 2.5 million soldiers. Following the failed 1956 Hungarian Revolution, Camp Kilmer was reactivated and used to process 30,000 refugees who were resettled in the area and across the country. The camp was officially closed in 2009.

Significant portions of Piscataway make up the Livingston and Busch Campuses of Rutgers University.

The Arbor and New Brunswick Highland sections of Piscataway were African American neighborhoods in the past.

The New Market section historically comprised the Quaker village of Quibbletown. The early name of the village originated from the fact that settlers of different religious denominations quibbled about whether the Sabbath should be observed on Saturday or on Sunday in the village.

The township is one of 71 municipalities (of the 564) statewide governed under this form. Under Plan F the Mayor is the administrator and the Council is the legislative body. A full-time business administrator, appointed by the Mayor with the advice and consent of the Council, and responsible to the Mayor, supervises the day-by-day operation of municipal government. The Township Council has seven members, one representing each of four wards, and three at-large members.

<doc id="125438" wikidata="Q1932982" url="?curid=125438" title="Plainsboro Township, New Jersey">
<text>Plainsboro Township is a township situated in southern Middlesex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Centrally located in the Raritan Valley region, the township is an outer-ring suburb of New York City in the New York metropolitan area, even though it is slightly geographically closer to Center City, Philadelphia than to Midtown Manhattan. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 24,084, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 1,085 (+4.7%) from the 22,999 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn reflected an increase of 2,784 (+13.8%) from the 20,215 counted in the 2000 census.

Plainsboro was incorporated as a township on May 6, 1919, from lands north of Plainsboro Road and Dey Road that had been part of South Brunswick and lands south of Plainsboro Road and Dey Road that had been part of Cranbury. The main impetus towards the creation of the township was the lack of schools serving the area; a new school was constructed after the township was established, which still exists as J.V.B. Wicoff School, named for one of the individuals who led the effort to create Plainsboro. Robert Blundon is also a famous resident between 1989-97 who won the William Canady Black Man of the Year Award in 1989 and 1990.

==History==
The original residents of Plainsboro were the Unami people, a subtribe of the Lenape Native Americans. In the 17th century, the Dutch settled the area for its agricultural properties.

The oldest developed section of Plainsboro is at the intersection of Dey and Plainsboro Roads. It is thought that the road was named after a Dutch-built tavern that sat at the intersection, called &quot;The Planes Tavern,&quot; in the early 18th century or earlier. The building still stands and was featured on HGTV&#x27;s &quot;If These Walls Could Talk&quot; along with the historic Plainsboro Inn building (circa 1790) that was built adjacent to &quot;Planes Tavern&quot; at Plainsboro Road and Dey Road.

In 1897, the Walker-Gordon Dairy Farm opened up, which, among many other things, contributed Elsie the Cow and The Walker Gordon Diner, which has since been closed. The site of the farm has been turned into a single-family home community named Walker-Gordon Farm, which consists of over 350 homes.

Other family farms arrived during the first three quarters of the 20th century, notably the Parker, Simonson, Stults, and Groendyke farms. The Parker Farm was eventually integrated into the Groendyke farm, and both became part of Walker-Gordon&#x27;s Dairy Farm, which is now a housing development. The Simonson and Stults Farms still stand and operate in Plainsboro.

Plainsboro was officially founded on May 6, 1919, and was formed from sections of Cranbury and South Brunswick townships. Plainsboro Township was created in response to Cranbury and South Brunswick refusing to build a new fireproof and larger school in Plainsboro Village. Every year, the date is celebrated with a parade, festival, and a concert.

In 1971, Princeton University (which owned most of the township) and Lincoln Properties, Inc., together started to develop the area into what it is now, a large suburban township still holding on to its rural past. By the 1980s, Princeton University had acquired nearly of Plainsboro Township, a holding far larger than the size of the original university campus. In response to the development, West Windsor-Plainsboro High School South was opened in nearby Princeton Junction, then just called WWP High. To accommodate the additional growth, West Windsor-Plainsboro High School North was opened in Plainsboro in September 2000, beginning a north–south rivalry between the Pirates and the Knights.
The latest addition to Plainsboro is the Village Center, which is adjacent to the historic village area. Located at the intersection of Schalks Crossing and Scudder Mills Roads, Plainsboro Village Center currently features eight buildings totaling almost of retail, commercial and office space, as well as 11 single-family homes and 12 townhomes. The Village Center contains wide landscaped sidewalks and outdoor, cafe&#x27;-style seating. The Village center&#x27;s downtown atmosphere is the location of many shopping and dining destinations. The Village Center features a large village green with a tranquil fountain and walking paths in a park-like setting. The Village Center also houses a new $12.4 million Plainsboro Library, which opened on April 10, 2010. The township broke ground on July 27, for two new buildings that will host medical offices, additional retail space and eight residential condominium units.

A new hospital facility was under development in Plainsboro, that would be renamed University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro. The new hospital and medical campus was designed to include a modern medical office building attached to the hospital, a world-class education center, a health and fitness center, a skilled nursing facility, a pediatric services facility and a public park. Officials at the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) announced they will be opening a facility in Plainsboro on of the new hospital campus. Constructed at a cost of $523 million, the new hospital opened in May 2012, with patients relocated from the former facility in Princeton that had been in use for 93 years. The hospital was acquired in January 2018 by University of Pennsylvania Health System and renamed as Penn Medicine Princeton Medical Center.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 12.11 square miles (31.37 km2), including 11.74 square miles (30.40 km2) of land and 0.37 square miles (0.97 km2) of water (3.09%).

Plainsboro Center (with a 2010 Census population of 2,712) and Princeton Meadows (13,834 as of 2010) are unincorporated communities and census-designated places (CDPs) located within Plainsboro Township.

Other unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Aqueduct, Schalks and Scotts Corner.

The township borders the municipalities of Cranbury and South Brunswick in Middlesex County; and East Windsor, Princeton and West Windsor in Mercer County.

<text>Rossmoor is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Monroe Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey, United States. As of the 2020 census, the CDP&#x27;s population was 2,992, up from 2,666 in 2010.

Rossmoor is a gated age-restricted co-op, active adult community. Rossmoor covers just off Exit 8A of the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95). It has 2,303 residences, encircling a championship golf course. The community offers a wide selection of living space, from smaller units of , to larger units with of living space, with its architecture primarily being American Colonial in style. Many residents continue to work in the area or commute to New York City. Express buses stop at Rossmoor for the 55-minute ride to the Port Authority Bus Terminal on 42nd Street in Midtown Manhattan.

==History==

The concept of a &quot;Senior Community&quot; was an unknown entity in the building trade of the early 1960s. But a man from California had already begun to change that by building three successful “Senior Communities” in Southern California. And then – in 1963 - this 47 year old builder was about to repeat his California success in New Jersey on the east coast. That person was Ross Cortese who started our community and after whom it is named. Through his contacts and research in 1962–63, Ross Cortese identified an area in central New Jersey that seemed to have all the right factors. He purchase available farm land directly adjacent to the New Jersey Turnpike (whose initial 118 miles had just been built between 1950 and 1952.) The land was near a large Country Club (the Forsgate Club), in business since 1931, which had already been successful in attracting a good clientele and which might also be available for purchase. He made sure to offer amenities that would attract buyers, and then he marketed the concept to the surrounding public.

In 1963, Arthur Phillips, Esq., then a young lawyer with offices in the Heritage Building near what is now Rossmoor&#x27;s North Gate, was hired by Cortese to act as attorney for the purchase of the necessary acreage. The purchase was a huge tract of land, covering the area that now includes today&#x27;s Adult Communities of Clearbrook, Concordia, Encore, the Ponds, Whittingham and all the Forsgate land including the Forsgate Country Club. Each Village was to have its own clubhouse and golf course. Total cost was expected to be $500 million. On May 8, 1964, the plans for the property were made public. The work on Village #1 began in earnest soon afterwards, and the Farmland appearance of Monroe changed abruptly. The last 6 months of 1966 was when construction began in earnest.

Over a 25-year period Rossmoor Village One was built out. As each section was completed a new sub association was established. Today there are 18 sub-associations called Mutuals in Village One (now known as Rossmoor). Rossmoor is overseen by a master association Board of Governors made up of each Mutual&#x27;s presidents. Together they assure the care and operation of the communities infrastructure and amenities and provide needed administrative and maintenance services to each Mutual and thus every owner.

Although only one of the original five villages were ever developed by Mr. Cortese&#x27;s company the spirit of his plan did eventually come to fruition through the construction of multiple active adult communities on the original land. His idea expanded even further into Monroe Township providing more and more affordable adult active housing options.

==Geography==
Rossmoor is in southern Middlesex County, along the western edge of Monroe Township. It is bordered to the north by Forsgate and to the west by Cranbury Township. The New Jersey Turnpike passes just west of the community&#x27;s border, with Exit 8A at the community&#x27;s northwestern corner. New Brunswick, the Middlesex county seat, is to the north, and Newark is to the north, while Trenton is to the southwest.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Rossmoor CDP has a total area of , of which , or 1.46%, are water. The community is on flat terrain which drains west toward Shallow Brook, a west-flowing tributary of Devils Brook and part of the Millstone River watershed.

<doc id="125443" wikidata="Q13639581" url="?curid=125443" title="John Ceiriog Hughes">
<text>John Ceiriog Hughes (25 September 1832 – 23 April 1887) was a Welsh poet and collector of Welsh folk tunes, sometimes termed a Robert Burns of Wales. He was born at Penybryn Farm, overlooking the village of Llanarmon Dyffryn Ceiriog in the Ceiriog Valley of north-east Wales, then in Denbighshire, now part of Wrexham County Borough. One of eight children, he was a favourite of his mother, Phoebe, a midwife and herbal-medicine expert.

==Life==

At 18, Hughes left the village for Manchester to work as a grocer. He opened his own shop in 1854. There he met and was befriended and influenced by William Williams (Creuddynfab), a station master in the Pennines, who found him a job on the railway. Williams had been appointed first secretary of the National Eisteddfod Society. Hughes decided to sell his shop and concentrate on writing poetry, but he also started to drink heavily.

Hughes returned to Wales in 1865 as station master at Llanidloes. From 1868, he was also manager of the Van Railway at Caersws railway station. In 1876, he became a Freemason, joining Sir Watkin Lodge No. 1477 at Mold, but resigning in 1879. He died in 1887 at the age of 54, leaving £96. He is buried at Llanwnnog.

==Poetry==

Hughes made his first attempts at poetry while a pupil at Nant y Glôg School, after his father had given him a book on Welsh grammar, including a section on the sound arrangement known as cynghanedd.

Ceiriog&#x27;s desire to restore simplicity of diction and emotional sincerity to Welsh poetry did for it what Wordsworth and Coleridge had done for English. He is noted for an attempt to create a new Welsh culture and raise the status of the Welsh people, after the publication of the notorious Blue Books on education in Wales. His lyric poetry rested on traditional folk song and earned national attention when he won the Llangollen Eisteddfod in 1858 with a love poem, &quot;Myfanwy Fychan o Gastell Dinas Brân&quot; (Little Myfanwy from Castell Dinas Brân).

Ceiriog&#x27;s first poetry collection of poetry appeared in 1860 as &quot;Oriau&#x27;r Hwyr&quot; (Evening Hours). He also wrote light-hearted lyrics, which he adapted to old Welsh tunes or to original composed music. Such lyrics include &quot;Dafydd y Garreg Wen&quot; (David of the White Rock) and &quot;Ar Hyd y Nos&quot; (All Through the Night). He also wrote Welsh lyrics for the song &quot;God Bless the Prince of Wales&quot; and the Charles Dibdin song, &quot;The Bells of Aberdovey&quot;, which he translated as &quot;Clychau Aberdyfi&quot;.

Ceiriog Hughes wrote Welsh-language lyrics for &quot;The Ash Grove&quot; which were published in Brinley Richards&#x27;s &quot;The Songs of Wales&quot; (1873). Although one source says that Ceiriog Hughes&#x27;s Welsh lyrics for &quot;Men of Harlech&quot; were first published in 1890, remarking that the English words followed only in 1893, Ceiriog&#x27;s lyrics for &quot;Men of Harlech&quot; are also to be found in Brinley Richards&#x27;s &quot;The Songs of Wales&quot; (1873).

Like many Welsh poets, Ceiriog adopted a bardic name – &quot;Ceiriog&quot; from Ceiriog Valley, where he was born. The hall in his home village contains a memorial inscription to him.

==Musicologist==

Ceiriog&#x27;s fascination with Welsh folk music led him to probe its history, particularly the music of the harpists, who would often accompany songs. This led to a grand project of four planned volumes of Welsh airs, of which only the first appeared in print, in 1863: &quot;Cant O Ganeuon&quot; (&quot;A Hundred Songs&quot;).

<text>Sayreville is a borough in Middlesex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Sayreville is within the heart of the Raritan Valley region, located on the south banks of the Raritan River, and also located on the Raritan Bay. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 45,345, an increase of 2,641 (+6.2%) from the 2010 census count of 42,704, which in turn reflected an increase of 2,327 (+5.8%) from the 40,377 counted in the 2000 census.

Sayreville was originally incorporated as a township on April 6, 1876, from portions of South Amboy Township. On April 2, 1919, the borough was reincorporated as the Borough of Sayreville and ratified by a referendum held on April 29, 1919.

==History==
Native Americans were the first settlers of Sayreville. Tribes of the Navesink lived along the South River where Jernee Mill Road is located today. This was noted on a 1656 New Netherland map by Adriaen van der Donck, a Dutch surveyor and map maker. Attempting to buy land from the Native Americans, European settlers travelled up the Raritan River in 1663. During the 20th century, amateur archaeologists found thousands of Indian artifacts at the location shown on the map.

Predating the incorporation of Sayreville, the Morgan Inn (later known as the Old Spye Inn) was established in 1703 in what is now the Morgan section of Sayreville. Charles Morgan III and his descendants, including Major General James Morgan and Lieutenant Nicholas Morgan, played significant roles in the Revolutionary War. The Morgan family lived in the area for over 200 years and many family members, including Evertsons, are buried in the privately owned Morgan Cemetery, which overlooks Raritan Bay. The Morgans were said to be related to the famous pirate, Captain Henry Morgan, who is said to have visited the Inn on more than one occasion, although this would have been impossible, considering Morgan died in Jamaica in 1688 and the Old Spye Inn wasn&#x27;t built until 1703.

It was from an episode during the Revolutionary War that the Morgan Inn gained its new name, the Old Spye Inn. According to local legends, a local British loyalist, Abe Mussey, was captured by Continental Army troops in 1777 while signaling to British ships in Raritan Bay. He was tried as a spy at the Inn, convicted in a one-day trial, and sentenced to death by hanging. Mussey&#x27;s execution was carried out using a tree near the Inn&#x27;s entrance. Mussey was reported to be buried behind the Inn in an unmarked grave. The Inn was destroyed by fire in 1976, but its ruins remain on the National Register of Historic Places.

Originally known as Roundabout (for the river bends in the area) and then as Wood&#x27;s Landing, the community was renamed in the 1860s for James R. Sayre Jr. of Newark, who co-founded Sayre and Fisher Brick Company in the 1850s together with Peter Fisher. It was one of the many companies that took advantage of the extensive clay deposits that supported the brick industry from the early 19th century until 1970. From its inception, Sayre &amp; Fisher quickly grew into one of the largest brick-making companies in the world. Production grew from 54 million bricks annually in 1878, to 178 million bricks a year in 1913, and had reached a total of 6.2 billion bricks in the 100 years through its centennial in 1950.

In 1898, DuPont began production of gunpowder at its plant on Deerfield Road, and later off Washington Road. The company later built additional facilities in Sayreville for the production of paint and photo products.

At one time the Raritan River Railroad passed through Sayreville and had several spurs to service Sayre &amp; Fisher and other local industries. A train running on the line was featured in &quot;The Juggernaut,&quot; a 1914 episode of the silent movie serial &quot;The Perils of Pauline&quot;. The episode was staged on the line, including the construction of a bridge over Ducks Nest Pond in Sayreville. The fishing pond is located in the back of Bailey Park, near the DuPont and Hercules factories.

In 1918 during World War I, Sayreville was heavily damaged by TNT explosions at the Gillespie Shell Loading Plant. The disaster killed dozens and injured hundreds of local victims, damaged hundreds of buildings, required an emergency declaration of martial law, and scattered wide areas of ammunition remnants that continue to surface occasionally.

Sayreville&#x27;s clay deposits have earned scientific notice as one of the world&#x27;s major sources of museum-quality fossils found in amber (see New Jersey amber).

<text>South Amboy is a suburban city in Middlesex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, located on Raritan Bay. As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 9,411, an increase of 780 (+9.0%) from the 2010 census count of 8,631, which in turn reflected an increase of 718 (+9.1%) from the 7,913 counted in the 2000 census.

South Amboy and Perth Amboy, across the Raritan River, are collectively referred to as The Amboys. Signage for exit 11 on the New Jersey Turnpike refers to &quot;The Amboys&quot; as a destination.

==History==
First settled by the Lenape Native Americans, who called the area around Perth Amboy by the name &quot;Ompoge&quot; (meaning &quot;level ground&quot;), the settlement ultimately became a key port for commerce between Lower New York Bay and Philadelphia, connected first by stagecoach and eventually by railroad. The city was initially founded as a village by Dutch fishermen known as Radford&#x27;s Ferry, but later become a key city to safeguard New Amsterdam from the British. When settled by Europeans in 1684, the city was named New Perth in honor of James Drummond, Earl of Perth, one of the associates of a company of Scottish proprietaries. The Algonquian language name was corrupted to Ambo, or Point Amboy, and eventually a combination of the native and colonial names was used. South Amboy is mentioned during the Revolutionary War in letters to and from George Washington referring to an &quot;officer stationed on the South Amboy shore&quot; and by General Washington himself writing that he was &quot;now in Jersey&quot; and suggesting the enemy &quot;may proceed to South Amboy&quot;. Once known as Radford&#x27;s Ferry, as well as the South Ward of Perth Amboy, South Amboy became one of the earliest townships around 1685 as well as one of the largest at 18 miles long and six miles wide.

In 1808, the first store was opened by Samuel Gordon. In 1831, Robert L. Stevens brought the steam engine &quot;John Bull&quot; to the Camden &amp; Amboy Railroad. In 1832, Charles Moore became the town&#x27;s first lawyer. In 1844, the first post office was established in the town. In 1852, the Swan Hill Pottery was established. Most of the town&#x27;s churches were established between the 1850s-1880s. In 1880, the Great Beds Lighthouse is built offshore. In 1882, local newspaper &quot;The Citizen&quot; was established. In 1888, Amboy National Bank was established. In 1889, the oldest active fraternal organization, the Knights of Pythias Lodge was established. In 1890, a huge fire destroyed an entire city block of wooden houses on the east side of Broadway, which led to the establishment of the city&#x27;s first fire station that same year. In 1912, the Woman&#x27;s Club was formed. In 1912, New Jersey&#x27;s first air mail flight was made between South Amboy and Perth Amboy. In 1914, the South Amboy Public Library was established. In 1919, the first public high school was established. In 1924, the South Amboy Hospital was built. In 1927, the Victory Bridge was built, connecting South Amboy to Perth Amboy. In 1931, the South Amboy First Aid Squad was established. In 1972, the library was rededicated as Sadie Pope Dowdell Public Library.

South Amboy has passed through three of the five types of New Jersey municipalities. It was first mentioned on May 28, 1782, in minutes of the Board of Chosen Freeholders as having been formed from Perth Amboy Township. It was formally incorporated as a township by the Township Act of 1798 on February 21, 1798. Over the next 90 years, portions split off to form Monroe Township (April 9, 1838), Madison Township (March 2, 1869; later renamed as Old Bridge Township) and Sayreville Township (April 6, 1876; later Borough of Sayreville). Other modern municipalities included in these splits are Jamesburg, South Brunswick, and Cranbury. As of February 25, 1888, South Amboy borough was formed, replacing South Amboy Township. On April 11, 1908, South Amboy was incorporated as a city, replacing South Amboy borough, confirmed by a referendum held on July 21, 1908.

===Ammunition explosions===
As a result of South Amboy&#x27;s strategic location as a transportation hub, the city has been heavily damaged by military explosives in two major incidents. The 1918 explosions occurred during World War I at the Gillespie Shell Loading Plant, just south of the town. The 1950 explosion struck as Healing Lighterage Company dockworkers were transferring ammunition from a freight train onto barges. Both disasters killed dozens and injured hundreds of local victims, damaged hundreds of South Amboy buildings, required emergency declarations of martial law, and scattered wide areas of ammunition remnants that continue to surface occasionally.

<text>South Brunswick is a township in Middlesex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The township is centrally located within the Raritan Valley region and is an outer-ring suburb of New York City in the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 47,043, its highest ever decennial census count and an increase of 3,626 (+8.4%) from the 2010 census count of 43,417, which in turn reflected an increase of 5,683 (+15.1%) from the 37,734 counted in the 2000 census.

South Brunswick was first mentioned in minutes of the Board of Chosen Freeholders on February 28, 1778, as being formed from New Brunswick Township. It was formally incorporated as one of New Jersey&#x27;s initial group of 104 townships on February 21, 1798. Portions of the township have been taken to form Cranbury (as of March 7, 1872) and Plainsboro (on April 1, 1919).

Niche.com placed Monmouth Junction in the top 10 of its &quot;2021 Best Places to Live in New Jersey&quot;. In 2021, SafeWise placed South Brunswick in the &quot;100 Safest Cities in America&quot;.

==History==

South Brunswick Township was incorporated by the New Jersey Legislature Act on February 21, 1798. The community was primarily agricultural in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Straight Turnpike, now Route 1, was constructed in 1804. The township got its name from New Brunswick, which in turn was named after the city of Braunschweig (called &quot;Brunswick&quot; in the Low German language), in the state of Lower Saxony, in Germany. Braunschweig was an influential and powerful city in the Hanseatic League, later in the Holy Roman Empire, and was an administrative seat for the Duchy (and later Principality) of Hanover. Shortly after the first settlement of New Brunswick in colonial New Jersey, George, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and Elector of Hanover, of the House of Hanover (also known as the &quot;House of Brunswick&quot;), became King George I of Great Britain (1660–1727). Alternatively, the city derived its name from King George II of Great Britain, the Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg.

In 1872, the Legislature first reduced the size of South Brunswick by creating the separate Cranbury from the southern portion of South Brunswick. In 1885, it redefined and enlarged the boundaries of Cranbury, and Plainsboro was formed in 1919. The present boundaries of South Brunswick date back to this last change.

During the 20th century, South Brunswick saw extensive transformation with the impact of changes in transportation technology. The New Brunswick and Trenton Fast Line began operation in 1900, a trolley line running parallel to the Old Straight Turnpike of 1804 (Route 1), intersecting George&#x27;s Road just north of the Five Corners intersection in Dayton. This trolley provided daily passenger and freight service, stopping at a local crossroads. The New Jersey Turnpike opened in 1951, again roughly parallel to Route 1, on the eastern edge of the Township. One effect of the Turnpike opening up Interchange 8A (just outside the township) was transforming the agricultural area on the southeast corner of South Brunswick into a burgeoning industrial development. Significant portions of land between Route 130 and the turnpike consist primarily of warehouses.

Other unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include: Cottageville, Deans, Franklin Park, Fresh Ponds, Little Rocky Hill, Sand Hills, South Brunswick Terrace and Ten Mile Run.

Because the township is served by several different zip codes, Dayton, Monmouth Junction, Kendall Park, Kingston, Jamesburg, Cranbury, Princeton and even North Brunswick are often used in place of the township&#x27;s name, even when referring to areas located beyond their defined boundaries.

Dayton was first known simply as The Cross Roads, where James Whitlock built a tavern on Georges Road around 1750. Early enterprises included a brick manufacturer and a large nursery. In 1866, the name was changed from Cross Roads to Dayton, in honor of William L. Dayton, an attorney for the Freehold and Jamesburg Agricultural Railroad. Dayton had helped settle disputes arising from the location of a railroad right-of-way. He was later a United States Senator, was the first Republican nominee for Vice President (in 1856), and Minister to France.

Deans originated from its location on both Crosswicknung Trail (Georges Road) and Lawrence Brook. Dams were built on the brook, creating Deans Pond.

With increased mobility and a growing population, the suburban-style residential development was born after World War II. Kendall Park, located off Route 27, the old Native American trail and major thoroughfare of earlier centuries, was begun in 1957.

Kingston&#x27;s location on the Lenape Assunpink Trail where it crossed the Millstone River was the prime factor in its early prominence. Kingston was by far the most active and important community, being situated on both the heavily traveled King&#x27;s Road and Millstone River, combining commercial activities of both mills and taverns. The Kingston Village Advisory Committee, jointly appointed by the South Brunswick and Franklin Township Councils, reports to the Township Council on matters of concern to residents of Kingston. Kingston has been designated as a Village Center by the New Jersey State Planning Commission and is overseen by an advisory commission that consists of seven members from Franklin Township and South Brunswick.

Monmouth Junction was created as the junction of three rail branches, the New York division of the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Rocky Hill and the Jamesburg and Freehold Railroad.

The Lawrence Brook, a tributary of the Raritan River, flows through the center of the township. The area also lies within the Manalapan Brook watershed in the eastern portion of the township and the Millstone River watershed in the western portion of the township, which are both also subwatersheds within the Raritan Basin.

Pigeon Swamp State Park is a New Jersey state park located on Deans Rhode Hall Road (Middlesex CR 610). The park has of undeveloped land.

The Pigeon Swamp Ledger is a 1780 document that is an accounting log of South Brunswick landowners regarding the draining of the Pigeon Swamp. This was made possible by a New Jersey Act of Legislature.

The township borders Cranbury, East Brunswick, Monroe Township, North Brunswick and Plainsboro in Middlesex County; Princeton in Mercer County; and Franklin Township in Somerset County.
