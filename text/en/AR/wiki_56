<text>Zalma, once known as &quot;Bollinger&#x27;s Mill&quot;, is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) on the banks of the winding Castor River at a point where the river makes a horseshoe bend in southern Bollinger County in southeast Missouri, United States. When the railroad moved to town, the name Bollinger&#x27;s Mill was changed to Zalma, after railroad worker Zalma Block. Zalma is also said to come from a Native American word meaning &quot;the end.&quot; As of the 2020 U.S. Census, Zalma had a population of 73.

Zalma is part of the Cape Girardeau−Jackson, MO-IL Metropolitan Statistical Area. Zalma is home to a number of state parks that feature a number of activities such as deer hunting, fishing, bird watching, horseback riding, and hiking. Blue Pond, the deepest natural pond in the state of Missouri, is located outside of Zalma.

==History==
In 1800, an Urban Asherbranner (or Asherbramer or Asherbrauner) settled on the upper portion of the Castor River, just where the river empties its waters into Mingo Bottom, and where the village of Zalma is now situated, built a log and brush dam and erected a water mill to grind corn. Philip Bollinger settled nearby.

In &quot;A History of Missouri&quot; (1908), Louis Houck states that the head rights to this mill were owned by Asherbranner himself, but were held instead by Philip Bollinger, a relative of Asherbranner&#x27;s wife, Barbara. Philip Bollinger was a relative of Major George Frederick Bollinger, who settled on Whitewater and founded Burfordville in Cape Girardeau County.

The mill was later transferred to the Davault Bollinger line. Davault&#x27;s third son, Daniel, succeeded his father as miller. Daniel is thought to have come to Zalma about mid-century (1850) to assume operation of the mill. His sister, Catherine (Kate), came with him. They repaired the log and brush dam and operated the mill until the Civil War. Daniel died about this time and his wife, Eleanora, operated the mill with hired help. This mill burned sometime between 1863 and 1873 perhaps by Southern sympathizers, but actual cause of the fire cannot be authenticated.

Zalma received its first post office in November 1876.

W.A. acquired the property and built a new mill house and a new dam. He put in machinery to grind wheat and corn, as well as a carding mill to card and wash wool. 

According to the &quot;Marble Hill Press&quot; (Oct. 28, 1897), the McMinn Mill burned in 1897. The dam remained intact for several years after the mill burned, before it suffered the same fate.

On Dec. 21, 1880, Louis Houck completed a railroad between Cape Girardeau and Delta. A spur line eventually connected Zalma to the railroad. Sometime in the early 1930s the railroad was abandoned and removed.

The town&#x27;s economy remained sluggish until the timber industry moved in. The Brown Cooperage Company bought thousands of acres of timber, mostly white oak, for $1 per acre. In 1884, the Bell Messler Company placed a factory at Zalma to cut veneer and box laths. The Zalma factory was located just upstream from the mill dam. This factory provided work for women who stacked the box laths in long rows in the sun for drying. A second box factory was located on the north side of Green Street near the Railroad Street intersection, a short distance west of the present Highway 51.

<text>Hallsville is a city in Boone County, Missouri. It is part of the Columbia metropolitan area. The population was 1,614 at the time of the 2020 census. Southeast of the town is Mount Zion Church and Cemetery, the site of the Battle of Mount Zion Church during the Civil War.

==History==

Hallsville was laid out in 1866. It was named for its first postmaster, Judge John W. Hall. The town was not platted originally, having grown naturally at a crossroads around a store and blacksmith. The Columbia Terminal Railroad platted the town of Hickman and installed a depot a half mile south, but Hallsville grew and Hickman did not.

Colonel William F. Switzler reported that in 1882, Hallsville contained five stores, one harness shop and one blacksmith shop, but no church or school house yet. The population was 65. During the Civil War, on 22 September 1863, the Mount Zion Church east of Hallsville was burned by northern troops. According to one claim by William Franklin Switzler, this was because Iowa Lieutenant Hartman found the church to be a &quot;bushwhacker&#x27;s nest.&quot; The church was rebuilt in 1867, torn down and rebuilt in 1903, and still stands. Hallsville is also the hometown to the famous painter in the 20th century Charles Morgenthaler. Charles Morgenthaler received his art education at the University of Missouri and the Art Institute of Chicago. He later moved to St. Louis, where he became a successful illustrator and mural painter.

<text>Harrisburg is a village in western Boone County, Missouri, United States. It is part of the Columbia, Missouri Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 266 at the 2010 census. It was founded to be an important railroad depot, but the railroad never came and the town remained small. Harrisburg is situated on a high point between Moniteau Creek and Perche Creek, at the headwaters of Callahan Creek. It is named in honor of John Woods Harris, an early county leader and owner of the nearby “Model Farm” on Thrall’s Prairie.

==History==
Harrisburg was named for John W. Harris, who inherited the Model Farm on what was Thrall&#x27;s Prairie, the first permanent settlement in the county. The town was laid out on the survey line of the prospective Louisiana and Missouri River Railroad which was later leased to Chicago and Alton Railroad. The line was graded and prepared, but was abandoned for a line farther north. The proposed line can be seen on the 1969 USGS topographic map of Harrisburg. According to Colonel W. F. Switzler, in 1882, there were a post office, three stores, a confectionary shop, a church, a mill, a blacksmith shop, and a public school building with the Masonic lodge above. That [Harrisburg School]] [building, constructed by the Freemasons, served as Harrisburg’s school and community center from 1878 to 1963. In 2013 it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, but was shortly afterward demolished due to dilapidation. The small Prewitt Family Cemetery is located behind Harrisburg Elementary School. The much larger Harrisburg Cemetery is located at the East end of town. The earliest burial was in 1863, and burials continue today, with an estimated 750 interments as of 2024.The post office was located in the saddle shop. Reverend Green Carey preached at the Bethlehem Baptist church a few miles south of Harrisburg for fifty years and claimed to have joined more than five hundred couples in marriage.

The first church building in town belonged to the Harrisburg Christian congregation. It was built in 1872 of local stone and donated wood. In 1880, the official record counted sixty seven members. In 1980, the hundred-year-old building was demolished and a new building took its place. The Baptist church is a part of the Southern Baptist Convention. The old church building, built in 1887, is still in use. In 1961, the two congregations were regularly trading Sundays.

==Geography==

Harrisburg is located on Missouri Route 124 about one mile from the Boone-Howard county line. Fayette is about eleven miles to the west and U.S. Route 63 is about seven miles to the east along route 124. Perche Creek flows past two miles east of the community.

<text>Sturgeon is a city in Boone County, Missouri, United States. It is part of the Columbia, Missouri Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 872 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Sturgeon was laid out in 1856 very near to and eventually including the town of Prairie City. The town was incorporated in 1859 with Housen Canada as the first mayor and rechartered in 1875. It was named for Isaac H. Sturgeon, superintendent of the North Missouri Railroad. Colonel W. F. Switzler speculated that the depot was considered in Sturgeon because it bore the name of the railroad magnate, but six citizens who paid six thousand dollars finalized the deal. The first school-house was built in 1857, and in 1882 the white and colored schools had 301 students with an average daily attendance of 187. The first church, built in 1859, was the Methodist Episcopal Church South, with the Masonic lodge located above. The first early industry in Sturgeon was the broom factory, established in 1878, of S. A. Fretwell. The brooms were made of broom corn grown in the area, and brushes made of imported jute. In 1882, the factory turned out about 360 brooms daily

In the spring of 1857, a tornado passed over the town and blew down several houses, including a new building of and three stories tall, purposed for a hotel. The first large fire took place on July 19, 1882. That evening, a fire was discovered in Wood&#x27;s Saloon, already bursting through the roof. The butcher&#x27;s shop, three saloons, three large livery stable buildings and sheds, and three other buildings were burned. The Sturgeon Savings Bank was saved from fire &quot;by covering the roof with carpet and sprinkling heavily with salt.&quot;

In the fall of 1953, the first Amish family moved to the land just north of Sturgeon. Now the community has expanded to over sixty families. Most of the Sturgeon Amish adhere closely to their beliefs and are classified as Old Order Amish, meaning they follow a very conservative Ordnung: self-sufficiency, charity, and individualism are very important. The community in Sturgeon and Clark operate many successful home businesses, selling sorghum, eggs, chicken, peanut brittle and produce in season.

In May 2024, Sturgeon police officer Myron Woodson shot and killed a blind and deaf Shih Tzu dog, Teddy, aged 5 and weighing 13 pounds. Teddy had wandered into another Sturgeon resident&#x27;s yard, leading to the resident feeding him water and contacting the authorities in an attempt to find his owner, with the authorities sending officer Woodson. Body camera footage showed Woodson shooting the dog twice after three minutes of Woodson repeatedly failing to capture the dog, which ran or walked away from the officer, without growling or trying to bite the officer. When the dog&#x27;s owner questioned Woodson about the killing, Woodson replied: &quot;What am I supposed to do? We don&#x27;t have freaking animal control.&quot; After the incident, the Sturgeon resident (who had contacted authorities) declared that the dog was not aggressive and &quot;was in no way a threat to others&quot;. One day after the shooting, the city of Sturgeon first commented that the dog was &quot;behaving strangely and displaying signs of possible injuries&quot; and seemingly &quot;rabid behavior&quot;; four days after the shooting, the city commented that after having &quot;reviewed the dispatch report and body camera footage&quot;, the city &quot;believes that the officer acted within his authority&quot;. After the incident was reported internationally and widespread public backlash ensued, Sturgeon mayor Kevin Abrahamson resigned six days after the shooting, while stand-in mayor Seth Truesdell denounced Woodson&#x27;s actions.

<text>Hamilton is a city in northern Caldwell County, Missouri, and is within the United States. The population was 1,690 at the 2020 census. It is known as the hometown of James Cash Penney, who built a large apparel-related business, J. C. Penney, and the hometown of Jenny Doan, who has built a large quilting-related business, Missouri Star Quilt Co.

==History==
Hamilton owes its existence largely to the Hannibal &amp; St. Joseph Railroad.
Prior to 1854 the area around Hamilton was unsettled prairie land belonging to the U.S. Government. With the coming of the railroad, the Hamilton Town Company was formed to develop a tract of land along the rails.

At first, the name Prairie City was intended for the new community. However, Albert Gallatin Davis, a key member of the Town Company, chose Hamilton instead, in honor of two early Americans, Founding Father and first Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, and Joseph Hamilton, an early American lawyer and military leader killed at the Battle of the Thames during the War of 1812.

The first house in Hamilton, fittingly, was built by Davis in the summer of 1855, as well as the first business, a general store, in 1857. The store would serve as Hamilton&#x27;s first post office and Davis as the first postmaster in 1858. The Hannibal &amp; St. Joseph Railroad was finally completed on February 14, 1859, and the first train arrived that day. A railroad depot was constructed by the fall of 1859, with Albert Gallatin Davis appointed the first railroad and express agent.

By the outbreak of the American Civil War, Hamilton consisted of about 25 homes and businesses. The town saw little involvement in the war, despite northwest and north-central Missouri being a hotbed of guerrilla warfare. The majority of the towns residents held strong pro-Union sympathies, with the few pro-Confederates among the populace forced to take an oath of allegiance. Being on the rail line made Hamilton a tempting target for Confederate &quot;bushwhackers&quot;, so beginning in the fall of 1861, a company of the 50th Illinois Infantry arrived to help the local Home Guard unit defend the town.

Once the Civil War ended, Hamilton experienced a period of rapid growth, and was incorporated in 1868. At that time several new sections of land had been annexed into the original town plat and the population grew to several hundred. After a brief slowdown caused by the Panic of 1873, growth resumed. By the mid-1880s, Hamilton had two newspapers, the &quot;Hamiltonian&quot; and the &quot;News-Graphic&quot;, as well as two banks, two hotels, flour mills, grain elevators, and other businesses supported by a population of around 1,800. Coal mining became of some importance to the town&#x27;s economy in the early 1880s. The Hamilton Coal Company was organized in the spring of 1882 and began mining operations the following year about two miles outside of the town. A railroad spur line was constructed to connect the coal field to the Hannibal &amp; St. Joseph main line.

<text>Auxvasse ( ) is a city in northern Callaway County, Missouri, United States. It is part of the Jefferson City, Missouri Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 983 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Auxvasse was originally called Clinton City, and under the latter name was platted in 1873 named after the nearby Auxvasse Creek. A post office called Auxvasse has been in operation since 1874.
Auxvasse has been claimed by at least 3 Callaway County townships since they were first delineated in 1821, when Auxvasse was located at the far northeast corner of the original boundaries of the then far-larger Cote Sans Dessein township for a period of only a few months. New townships (Fulton, Round Prairie, Nine Mile Prairie) were formed 1821–1838 in northern Callaway County, and a study of historical references should clarify which township Auxvasse was claimed by during that period. In February 1838, the newly formed Liberty Township included Auxvasse as a key town in its eastern sector for nearly 40 years; but when the newer Jackson Township was created in December 1875, Auxvasse was included instead in its western half, where it remains to this day as its largest population center.

==Geography==
Auxvasse is located in the northern part of the county on US Route 54 between Mexico to the north and Kingdom City to the south.

<text>Fulton is the largest city in and the county seat of Callaway County, Missouri, United States. Located about northeast of Jefferson City and the Missouri River and east of Columbia, the city is part of the Jefferson City, Missouri, Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 12,600 at the 2020 census. The city is home to two universities, Westminster College and William Woods University; the Missouri School for the Deaf; the Fulton State Hospital; and the Fulton Reception and Diagnostic Center state prison. Missouri&#x27;s only nuclear power plant, the Callaway Plant is located 13 miles southeast of Fulton.

==History==
The first settlement in the county was in 1809 at Cote Sans Dessein along the Missouri River. Early leaders considered siting the first Missouri state capital in the territory between Wainwright and Tebbetts. Callaway County was organized in 1820 and was named after Captain James Callaway, who was killed by Native Americans. Elizabeth became the first county seat. Many of the villages and towns in the county today represent places where railroad stations existed in early years.

In 1861, word arrived that Union troops had advanced to a nearby county. Colonel Jefferson F. Jones, from eastern Callaway County, assembled troops to protect the county. Forces were limited as many were already defending the country, but Jones marched the troops eastward to meet the approaching companies.

The successful defense was merely an illusion. Tree logs, erected by the troops, resembled artillery in the shadows of campfires and deterred Union troops. Talks continued several days and secured a mutual ceasefire agreement between the United States of America and Callaway County. Elated from the successful defense, citizens proclaimed their county The Kingdom of Callaway, a reference that remains today.

Fulton, the largest city in Callaway County, was founded and became the county seat in 1825 but was not incorporated until March 14, 1859. The city was originally named Volney after Constantin François de Chassebœuf, comte de Volney, but was changed to honor Robert Fulton, the engineer and inventor, two months after the initial Volney name in 1825. Volney, New York is a town in Oswego County, New York which is also named for Volney. A village within the town of Volney is Fulton, New York which is also named for Robert Fulton.

The early residents of Fulton were from predominantly southern culture. The coastal and upland southerners that settled the land brought with them slaves and established an agricultural economy.

When the first history of Callaway County was compiled in 1884, the die had already been cast as far as the type of community Fulton was to be. The Missouri General Assembly had voted to establish an asylum for the insane in Fulton (February 26, 1847), the first mental health facility west of the Mississippi; the General Assembly agreed (February 28, 1851) to establish a school for the education of the deaf in Fulton; in 1842 the Presbyterian Church had opened a female seminary later known as Synodical College; in the fall of 1851 the Presbyterian Church established the all-male Fulton College, now known as Westminster College; and Fulton was the seat of county government. Winston Churchill gave his famous &quot;&quot; (Iron Curtain) speech at Westminster on March 5, 1946, in the presence of President Harry S. Truman.

The Christian Church moved its Orphan School to Fulton in 1890. Whether or not they were influenced by the already-existing colleges is not known, but Fulton&#x27;s bid of $40,000 and the offer of of land was surely a factor. The school, which had previously been located at Camden Point, Missouri, later became William Woods College for Women, which later became a coed university.

Novelist Henry Bellamann was born in Fulton in 1882, and grew up and attended college there. Fulton is said to have been Bellamann&#x27;s model for the fictional town of the novel &quot;Kings Row&quot;, which generated questions about the resemblance it had to individuals and situations around the area. In 1940, producers made a movie based on the book. The cast included Ann Sheridan, Robert Cummings, Ronald Reagan and Betty Field. The suit worn by Ronald Reagan in the film is on display at the Show Me Innovation Center offices of the Callaway Chamber of Commerce.

The M. Fred Bell Rental Cottage, M. Fred Bell Speculative Cottage, Brandon-Bell-Collier House, George Washington Carver School, Court Street Historic Residential District, Fulton&#x27;s Downtown Brick District, John Augustus Hockaday House, Pitcher Store, Robnett-Payne House, Westminster College Gymnasium, Westminster College Historic District, and White Cloud Presbyterian Church and Cemetery are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Kingdom City is a village in Callaway County, Missouri, United States. It is part of the Jefferson City Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 128 at the 2010 census. The village lies north of the intersection of Interstate 70 and U.S. Route 54.

==History==
Kingdom City has its origins in the building of US Route 40 in 1925, at the same time US Route 54 was being planned with the intention of intersecting US 40 somewhere along the route. The city of Fulton had hoped for US 40 to go from Columbia through Fulton and intersect US 54 in their city, but the final decision had the highways intersect in what would become Kingdom City, which was then just a rural farm and forested area south of McCredie. McCredie residents fought so hard for the highway that they staged a parade through the heart of Fulton with banners that read &quot;54-40 or Fight&quot;. When the road was being built and huge numbers of workers were brought in to do the work, McCredie became a boom town, with future Kingdom City receiving its first gas station and a two-story hotel, which (however) burned down in 1930.

Since the area had no name at the time the intersection was referred to only as the &quot;Y&quot;, with people in Fulton wanting to name it &quot;North Fulton&quot; and the people in McCredie naming it &quot;South McCredie&quot;. The Kingdom Oil Company, owned by B.P. (Bernard Parker) Beamer, suggested Kingdom City, in reflection of the nickname for Callaway County. Through the 1920s and 30s numerous dance halls, restaurants, cafés, and hotels would come and go in Kingdom City. In 1965, Gasper&#x27;s (which became a local landmark) opened for business. In 1970, the McCredie Post Office moved to Kingdom City and took the community&#x27;s name. This was the same year Kingdom City incorporated as a village and included the former unincorporated community of McCredie.

The Richland Christian Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.

==Geography==
Kingdom City is located along U.S. Route 54 approximately one half mile north of I-70. McKinney Creek flows past the south edge of the community and Auxvasse Creek passes two miles to the north. The town of Auxvasse lies about five miles north along Route 54. The junction is planned to be upgraded to a roundabout configuration. Construction is planned in 2024 moved from 2026. The move is from the wider project to improve I-70 across Missouri.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which of it is land and is water.

<text>Mokane (founded as Smith&#x27;s Landing and later known as Saint Aubert) is a small city in southern Callaway County, Missouri, United States. The population was 185 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Jefferson City Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The settlement was first named Smith&#x27;s Landing, after Thomas Smith, who settled there around 1818, and is said to be the second- or third-oldest town in Callaway County. 

The settlement took on the name Saint Aubert around the time a post office was built there in 1849. Official Callaway County maps of 1876 show St. Aubert, which was also the name of its township area. The town was still referred to as Saint Aubert when Livingston&#x27;s &quot;History of Northeast Missouri&quot; went to press in 1883 or 1884.

On July 1, 1893, the Missouri, Kansas and Eastern Railway, a subsidiary of the MKT Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, took possession of the rail line that passed through the town to Saint Louis. The line included a station stop. Within a few years, the town received a new name based on the name of the railroad: Mo., Kan. &amp; E. In 1897, Callaway County&#x27;s official map shows the town named &quot;Mokane&quot;. Compared to the 1876 map, it also moves the town one land section northward, due to the inundation of old Saint Aubert.

==Geography==
Mokane is located on the north side of the Missouri River valley along Missouri Route 94 between Tebbetts to the southwest and Steedman to the northeast. Fulton lies about twelve miles to the north along Missouri Route C. The Katy Trail, a rails-to-trails hiking/biking path, runs through the town, which stands at mile 125.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<text>New Bloomfield is a city in Cedar Township, Callaway County, Missouri, United States. The population was 669 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Jefferson City Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
In 1827, a &#x27;Round Prairie Post Office&#x27; was opened northwest of New Bloomfield, near what became Guthrie almost 50 years later, and near the southern border of a much larger historic Round Prairie Township (subdivided around 1890 to create what then became the northern portion of Guthrie Township).

In 1836, a historic town of &#x27;Bloomfield&#x27;, next to or containing the Round Prairie Post Office, was first surveyed.

In 1841, the Round Prairie Post Office was shut down and moved about 1/2 mile southward, clearly into Cedar Township, and was renamed &#x27;New Bloomfield Post Office&#x27;, around which today&#x27;s town of New Bloomfield formed. The official establishment of the town of Guthrie as &#x27;Bigbee&#x27; and a new Guthrie Post Office (closed in 1954) followed in 1872 and 1874. The Chicago &amp; Alton Railroad went from the Missouri riverport at Cedar City, through Holts Summit, then New Bloomfield and Guthrie, then veered northeast toward Carrington, then Fulton, then McCredie, Auxvasse, and into Audrain County and the city of Mexico, and thereafter toward Illinois and Chicago to the east, or to Kansas City to the west. Connection to St Louis was made via locations across the Mississippi River in Illinois until the MKT railroad was built in the 1890s. A ferry boat connected the Cedar City railway station to Jefferson City until a bridge was built in 1896. The New Bloomfield railroad station was located in what is now the New Bloomfield City Park. Details of relevant township boundary changes are given in the articles on both Round Prairie Township and Cedar Township.

<text>Linn Creek is a city in Camden County, Missouri, United States. The population was 216 at the 2020 census.

The original Linn Creek, which was the former county seat of Camden County, Missouri, is now under water, in the Lake of the Ozarks. Construction of the Bagnell Dam that created the lake was begun August 8, 1929. The county seat was moved to the new town of Camdenton which had its beginnings in 1931.

==History==

=== Old Linn Creek ===
Linn Creek was settled in 1841 at the junction of the Niangua and Osage Rivers. It was named from the creek on which it is situated, and which was named for the many linn trees lining its banks. The city was considered a head of navigation on the Osage and became a major hub for transportation in southwest Missouri. 

Linn Creek became the county seat in 1855 after a cholera epidemic killed most of the population of the former county seat of Erie.

A skirmish took place on October 14, 1861 between Union soldiers of the 13th Illinois, Fremont Battalion (Missouri) Cavalry and Confederates of Captain William Roberts.

The local newspaper, The Linn Creek Reveille, was created and published by J. W. Vincent from 1879 until his death in 1933. According to J. W. Vincent, the Moulder family was the most numerous and prominent family in the county

=== Modern Linn Creek ===
In 1929, it was announced that the Bagnell Dam would be constructed and the town would be flooded, causing controversy among the city&#x27;s citizens. Almost all of the buildings were demolished, and the city was moved to a higher elevation, losing its designation as the county seat. The location where Linn Creek now resides was formerly the location of a small settlement called Easterville.

&quot;New Linn Creek&quot; became a common name for the new town. The Linn Creek Chamber of Commerce promoted the town as &quot;The Miracle City.&quot;

<text>Macks Creek is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in southwest Camden County, Missouri, United States. The population was 244 at the 2010 census.

==History==

A post office called Macks Creek has been in operation since 1872. The community takes its name from a nearby creek of the same name, which most likely was named after the local Mack or Hack family.

In 1997, a state audit of Macks Creek&#x27;s treasury uncovered major financial woes. Shortly afterward, virtually every town official resigned from office and the city itself declared bankruptcy.

On August 7, 2012, voters approved dissolving the town with 69% in favor of the motion (above the required amount of 60%). The disincorporation turned out to be a slow and challenging process.

===Speed trap designation===
For years, Macks Creek had one of the most infamous speed traps in the nation, with a strictly enforced speed limit along US 54, which had a speed limit on either side of town. 
In 1995, this practice ended when the state of Missouri passed a law prohibiting cities and towns from collecting more than 45% of their total revenue from speeding tickets. Macks Creek reportedly had been collecting approximately 85% of its revenue from speeding tickets. The police department later resigned as well as the mayor. In May 2022, Reason magazine reported that, &quot;If a small town has a law named after it, it&#x27;s probably not for a good reason. Such was the case with Macks Creek, an obnoxious speed trap that inspired the Missouri legislature to pass the Macks Creek Law in 1995. This bill capped the percentage of annual revenue that towns could generate from ticket fines at 45 percent.&quot;

==Geography==

Macks Creek is located on Macks Creek and U.S. Route 54, west of Camdenton and east of Preston.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

<text>Dutchtown is a census-designated place (CDP) and former village in Cape Girardeau County, Missouri, United States, located at the intersection of Routes 25 and 74. The population was 163 at the 2020 census. It was part of the Cape Girardeau–Jackson, MO-IL Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Dutchtown had a long history of habitation. Martin Rodner, a Hessian soldier who came to America in 1776 to fight for the British during America&#x27;s Revolutionary War, moved his family to the Dutchtown area in 1801, where he owned a water mill on Hubble Creek. Because his American neighbors had trouble pronouncing his name, it became &quot;Rodney&quot;, and his mill was known as Rodney&#x27;s Mill. He died in 1827. 
In the mid-1830s, the area near Rodney&#x27;s Mill began being settled by Swiss and German families; they called their settlement Spencer. That later became Dutchtown, a variation of the word &quot;Deutsch,&quot; which means German.
The small village grew. A blacksmith and a bricklayer settled there. Bloomfield Road ran through the town, as did railroad tracks.

In 1799, the first Protestant sermon and baptism immersion west of the Mississippi River was performed in Randol Creek near modern-day Dutchtown.
In 1836 the German Evangelical Church was founded and remained an active congregation until about 1900. The original church was log, but a brick edifice was built in 1887. The church remains, as does its cemetery with about 150 markers.
The church was also referred to as the &quot;Swamp Church,&quot; since the village was built on the edge of a swamp.

Dutchtown was incorporated in February 1998 following a petition created by residents, and was disincorporated on 15 March 2018, following continuous flooding problems. The constant flooding (which occurred in 1973, 1993, 1995, 1998, 2002, 2011, 2013, 2016 and 2017) caused several people to already seek federal buyouts, and all of Dutchtown&#x27;s assets will be handed over to the county.

==Geography==
Dutchtown is located at (37.252300, -89.658064).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all land.

<text>Jackson is a city in and the county seat of Cape Girardeau County, Missouri, United States. It is a principal city of the Cape Girardeau–Jackson, MO-IL Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population of Jackson was 15,481 at the 2020 census.

==History==

In 1813, Cape Girardeau County succeeded Cape Girardeau District, and the Court of Common Pleas and the Court of General Quarter-Sessions of the Peace in Cape Girardeau were superseded by the Court of Common Pleas, leading to a new seat of justice. The seat of the county and the courts were at first held on the plantation of Thomas Bull about one and one-half mile south of present-day Jackson. Land was then purchased along Hubble Creek for the county seat in 1814.

The first post office was established in 1814 when the area was called Birdstown. The name was changed to Jackson on August 31, 1819, named for Andrew Jackson, a general popular for his role in the War of 1812. It was the first town to be named after Andrew Jackson. The town was platted in 1815. The &quot;Missouri Herald&quot;, the third newspaper in state, was established here on June 25, 1819. In 1818, the town already had a population of 300. The first county courthouse was built in 1818 on Jackson&#x27;s public square.

Although its initial growth was rapid, the economy of the City of Jackson developed conservatively. The town suffered a setback in June, 1833, when Cholera spread killing 128. Cholera struck again on June 10, 1852, causing all abled bodies to flee the town until the epidemic had run its course. In 1841, a bank was established. A flour mill was constructed in 1855 and another in 1873. But the community could not escape the impact of the American Civil War; on June 24, 1861, a military skirmish took place near Jackson between units of the Union Army and the Confederate Army.

In 1877, Jackson was linked to Cape Girardeau by the first long-distance railway service line in Missouri. By 1884, the population of the City of Jackson had grown to 2,105, and the town supported 50 businesses. In 1884, by popular vote, it was decided to incorporate Jackson as a city of the fourth class. The courthouse built in 1818 burned down in 1870. The current courthouse was built in 1908 and is “on the square” in the center of Uptown Jackson where Jones Drug Store still runs and serves the community since 1871.

The Big Hill Farmstead Historic District, Abraham Byrd House, Frizel-Welling House, Jackson Uptown Commercial Historic District, and McKendree Chapel are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Jackson is located on US Route 61 approximately seven miles northwest of Cape Girardeau. Hubble Creek and its tributary Goose Creek flow through the city.

<text>Pocahontas is a village in Cape Girardeau County, Missouri, United States. The population was 97 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Cape Girardeau–Jackson, MO-IL Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Name==
Tradition has that Samuel Green opened a post office and started the town, and therefore was required by the government to provide a name for the town. Samuel Green had fallen in love with a princess of the Shawnee and Delaware tribes living along Apple Creek, but she had left the region along with the tribes when they moved west. Green intended to name the town after this woman whom he longed for. Unfortunately, the name of this princess was difficult to pronounce and nearly as impossible to spell, so when registering the town’s name, Green decided to substitute his love’s name for the name of the historic Indian princess Pocahontas, of colonial Virginia fame.

&quot;Joseph Abernathy who looked like an Indian and according to tradition was a descendant of Pocahontas, was the head of another branch of the Abernathy family. He too was born in NC and moved to MO at a very early date. The town of Pocahontas was named in honor of him and in recognition of this tradition.&quot;

==History==
The early inhabitants of the area were the Mississippian Mound Builders, who were part of the Mississippian culture. The Mound Builders went into decline in the 12th and 13th centuries, resulting in a depopulation of the area. In the latter part of the 18th century, French and Spanish officials allowed the immigration of Shawnee and Delaware Indians from Ohio. In the 1820s, these Indians were moved further west, with only a few remaining behind. The last of the Indians to stay were removed from the area in 1857.

Early American settlers to the area were the Abernathy and Little families, who farmed the land around present-day Pocahontas. Samuel Green, an Englishman, purchased land from Joseph Abernathy and operated the Green Station general store and post office. The Applecreek Presbyterian Church was established in 1821 and celebrates its 200 year anniversary in 2021, German and Austrian immigrants began to settle around Pocahontas. St. John Iowa Synod Lutheran Church was founded in 1870, and in 1889 Zion Lutheran Church Missouri Synod was built. It was incorporated as a town in 1893. A flour mill was constructed by John Hatcher, and today the mill is still operated as the Bowman Milling Company. A public school and two Lutheran parochial schools were also established. As of 2015, the town had four stores, several shops, a planing mill and a lumber yard.

==Geography==
Pocahontas is located in north-central Cape Girardeau County, approximately thirteen miles north-northeast of Cape Girardeau and seven miles due west of Neelys Landing on the Mississippi River.

<doc id="122578" wikidata="Q956795" url="?curid=122578" title="Ellsinore, Missouri">
<text>Ellsinore is a town in Carter County, Missouri, United States. The 2020 U.S. Census showed Ellsinore with a population of 416.

==History==
The site of the town of Ellsinore was originally patented on April 15, 1857, by Robert Patterson just two years before Carter County was organized. The land was later sold to a Mr. Cook, who in October 1876, sold the land to Charles Hearin. Charles Hearin cleared the land and raised corn and pumpkins on it. In 1888 Charles Hearin gave the Houck Railroad a right of way across his land, laid out the town, and built a railroad depot on the south side of the creek.

On March 2, 1889, the Current Local printed the following: “Over in the kingdom of Carter, on the land of the Cape Girardeau and Southwestern Railroad (Houck Railroad), at a point eleven miles distant from Williamsville, there is in process of evolution a little town bearing the name of Ellsinore …”

It is not exactly certain how the town came to be called Ellsinore, but the most widely accepted story is that Mr. Brooks, the chief engineer of the Houck Railroad, named the town after Elsinore Castle in Denmark, the setting of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The post office however added an extra “l” making the spelling “Ellsinore.”

In 1888 John Carr opened the first store in Ellsinore which catered largely to the men who were building the railroad.

In early 1889 the Ellsinore Post Office was established, Silace Pace being its first postmaster.

In 1889 William Crommer and Bob Evans began operating a sawmill at Ellsinore, buying up most of the timber in the area that had not already been bought up by the Missouri Lumber and Mining Company. After passing through a number of hands it finally closed down in 1903 and the equipment moved to Kelley Fork in Wayne County.

In 1891 the first school was organized in Ellsinore. It consisted of a one-room school building and a two-room L-shaped building. Almost all the equipment was home made and the entire library consisted of a single very old copy of Webster&#x27;s dictionary. The school was located near where the old water tower is located.

In 1895 the Ellsinore Hotel, run by Mamie Seats, was built and began operations.

In 1904 E. P. Queen and S. F. Jackson started up a new sawmill at Ellsinore. It was sold to the Store and Timber Company in 1908, which soon after went bankrupt.

In 1904 W. E. Condray and Clarence Crites began the Carter County Canning Company (4C Brand) in Ellsinore, but the business folded in 1907 largely due to a lack of interest.

In 1907 the Bank of Ellsinore was established. The bank was robbed on August 14, 1918, but no arrests were ever made. The Bank of Ellsinore closed its doors in 1930.

In 1912 the Ellsinore, Crommer Town, Lower Ten Mile, Upper Ten Mile, Hogan Hollow, White&#x27;s Mill and Freeland school districts consolidated for the purpose of creating a high school.

In 1912 after passing through a number of owners the Ellsinore Hotel burned, and a new structure, the Seats Hotel, was built on the lot in 1913.

In 1913/14 the Ellsinore High School was accredited by the State Department of Education.

In 1918 “The Ellsinore News” began publication. Its name was later changed to “The Carter County News.” The newspaper folded in 1926.

In 1919 a new school building, a two-story brick structure, was built on the south side of town on the site where the school currently stands.

In 1920 the Farmers State Bank was established. Financial difficulty forced it to close its doors in 1924.

In 1937 the Ellsinore School was rebuilt with WPA labor.

In 1938 the Ellsinore Post Office became the first office for Ozark Border Electric Cooperative and its postmaster, P.G. Wingo became the cooperative&#x27;s first board president.

On April 13, 1939, a ceremonial first pole for Ozark Border Electric Cooperative was raised behind the Ellsinore Post Office.

Van Buren was founded in 1833 as the county seat of Ripley County and was named after then Vice President of the United States, Martin Van Buren. In 1859, Van Buren became a part of the newly created Carter County and was subsequently selected to be the county seat. The 2020 U.S. Census showed Van Buren with a population of 747.

==History==
In 1833, a commission appointed to choose a site for the county seat of Ripley County selected a site west and across Current River from the present location of Van Buren. They named the new county seat Van Buren after the then Vice President of the United States, Martin Van Buren. A courthouse was built and a small city grew up around it. The city had one small general merchandise store run by a man named Shaw and a water powered grist mill owned by John George.

Van Buren remained the county seat of Ripley County until 1847, when the county seat was moved south to the town of Doniphan. After removing the county seat to Doniphan, the town declined until only three or four families remained.

On March 10, 1859, Van Buren became part of the newly created Carter County, and on April 4 of that year, Van Buren was selected to be the county seat of Carter County.

In 1867 the present site of Van Buren, located about east and across the river from the original site, was purchased from Zimri A. Carter. of land were purchased from Zimri A. Carter for $475 and the deed was given to Carter County commissioner James Snider. Even before the new city site was fully laid out, the first building to be built was a log courthouse located somewhat west of the current courthouse.

In 1874, the &quot;Vidette&quot;, a newspaper published by Dr. McDonald, began a brief run of only a few months before it folded. In 1876, another newspaper, the &quot;Times&quot;, published by Tom Brown and James Moseley, was published until 1884, at which time it was merged with the &quot;Current Local&quot;, which was established by Clay Moseley that same year, and which is now Carter County&#x27;s only locally published newspaper.

In 1893–94, the first bridge to cross the Current River was built at Van Buren at a total cost of $4,500. It was a suspension bridge and a toll of 5 cents per person and 15 cents for a team and wagon was charged for crossing it.

In 1901 the Carter County Bank, later known as the Carter County State Bank, was instituted in Van Buren.

In 1907, the company of Pitman and Henry began a motorboat passenger service up and down the Current River between Van Buren and Doniphan.

Sometime after 1907 the lines of the Willow Springs Local Long Distance Phone Company reached Van Buren bringing phone service to Van Buren.

In 1909, a structural steel bridge was built across the Current River at a total cost of approximately $9,000. This bridge was destroyed by a flood in 1915. The bridge was rebuilt at a cost of $15,000 and served the community until 1926, when a new $200,000 bridge was completed. Route 16, later to become U.S. Highway 60, crossed this bridge.

In 1927, electricity first came to Van Buren. The electricity was produced by a generator plant at Van Buren until 1934, at which time electricity generated by plants at Joplin and Lebanon was brought into the city.

<text>Harrisonville is a city in Cass County, Missouri, United States. The population was 10,121 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Cass 
County. It is part of the Kansas City metropolitan area.

==History==
Harrisonville was founded in 1837 upon land donated to Cass County by Congress for county purposes, and was named for Congressman Albert G. Harrison, who was instrumental in obtaining the land grant. The area suffered greatly during the American Civil War, though Harrisonville was one of the few places exempted in Union General Thomas Ewing&#x27;s General Order No. 11 (1863), which ordered the depopulation of three entire Missouri counties and part of a fourth.

In 1972, Harrisonville was the site of escalating tensions between a handful of mostly Vietnam veterans and town elders, which culminated in a brief rampage by 25-year-old Charlie &quot;Ootney&quot; Simpson. In the town square, in plain view of onlookers, he killed two police officers and a bystander before shooting himself. The victims were officers Donald Marler and Francis Wirt and local businessman Orville Allen. His motivation turned out to be personal, not political; he had saved money to buy a farm, but the seller had recently backed out of the deal, and Simpson had used the money to bail his friends out of jail.

The Robert A. Brown House, Harrisonville Courthouse Square Historic District, and St. Peter&#x27;s Episcopal Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

A May 2017 report from Missouri State Auditor Nicole Galloway gave the city the lowest possible rating of &quot;poor,&quot; citing complex, often overlapping tax districts, contracts awarded without appropriate bidding processes and overuse of money pulled from restricted funds.

==Geography==

<text>Peculiar is a city in Cass County, Missouri and is part of the Kansas City metropolitan area within the United States. The population was 4,608 at the 2010 census. The town motto is &quot;Where the &#x27;odds&#x27; are with you.&quot;

==History==
Early settlers of the town came to Western Missouri by riverboat from Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. Peculiar also had families coming from Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia. On July 29, 1868, the county surveyor, Robert Cass, platted Peculiar and was filed as &quot;The Town of Peculiar&quot;.

There are at least two versions of the story on how Peculiar received its name. The first involves the community&#x27;s first postmaster, Edgar Thomson. His first choice for a town name, &quot;Excelsior,&quot; was rejected because it already existed in Atchison County, Missouri. Several other choices were also rejected. The story goes that the annoyed Thomson wrote to the Postmaster General himself to complain saying, among other things, &quot;We don&#x27;t care what name you give us so long as it is sort of &#x27;peculiar&#x27;.&quot; Thomson submitted the name &quot;Peculiar&quot; and the name was approved. The post office was established on June 22, 1868.

In an alternate version, according to Missouri folklorist Margot Ford McMillen, early settlers were searching for a location to farm. As they cleared a small rise and looked below, one remarked &quot;Well that&#x27;s peculiar! It&#x27;s the very place I saw in a vision back in Connecticut.&quot; The land was purchased and eventually a village sprang up on it, which was named &quot;Peculiar&quot;.

Peculiar incorporated as a village in the 1890s and became a fourth class city of the state of Missouri in 1953.

The city celebrated its centenary in July 1968. The celebrations continued for nine days and included an antique show and sale, a Lions Club championship rodeo, and an open class Western horse show.

==Government==
Peculiar is governed by a Mayor–council government system. The mayor is elected to a two-year term. The town council, called the Board of Aldermen, is composed of six members. Two members are elected from each of the three wards in the city. One alderman is elected each year for each ward to serve a two-year term.

==Geography==

<text>Pleasant Hill is a city in Cass and Jackson counties, Missouri, United States. The population was 8,777 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Kansas City metropolitan area.

Pleasant Hill is home for the National Weather Service Kansas City/Pleasant Hill, Missouri office, which serves 37 counties in northern and western Missouri and seven counties in extreme east-central Kansas.

== History ==
Pleasant Hill was platted in 1844 by William Wright and was recorded as the &quot;Original Town of Pleasant Hill.&quot; Wright and Methodist circuit rider William Ferrell operated a mercantile store. The original location was on a ridge near Pleasant Hill Cemetery. The community was named after its &quot;pleasant situation on an elevated prairie&quot;. Wright also operated a 3-story tavern that was marked by a 12-foot high beacon atop a pole. It was an overnight stop for stagecoaches between Lexington, Missouri and Fort Scott, Kansas.

During the American Civil War and the run-up to it in the 1860s, Pleasant Hill was bitterly divided between the factions and was subject to numerous bushwhacking incidents. The most notable incidents involved the congregations of the Christian and Presbyterian churches which were built side by side on High Street. The Presbyterian Church was burnt in the process. In 1863 all residents in the area were forced to move from the community in General Order No. 11 (1863).

In 1865 after residents were able to return the city center moved one mile southwest down the hill to the railhead of the Pacific Railroad (the original town site is still within the city limits, however the area is now called &quot;Old Town&quot;). The new city center was lower than the original and adjoins Big Creek.

The Pleasant Hill Downtown Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.

The Pleasant Hill Historical Society Museum, outside that district, but in a building that incorporates elements of other historic buildings, is a museum covering the town&#x27;s history.

In 2016 the former Pacific Railroad line (which was later owned by the Rock Island Railroad) was converted to the western terminus of the 47-mile-long Rock Island Trail State Park (Missouri) and connects the Rails to Trails to the 240-mile-long Katy Trail State Park.

== Geography ==
Pleasant Hill is located in northeastern Cass County at the intersection of Missouri routes 7 and 58 approximately ten miles north-northeast of Harrisonville. Lee&#x27;s Summit is ten miles to the northwest in adjacent Jackson County. Big Creek flows past the west margin of the city.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

<text>Brunswick is a city in Chariton County, Missouri, United States. Its population was 801 at the 2020 census. Brunswick, by official state proclamation, is the Pecan Capital of Missouri. The Missouri Farmers Association (MFA Incorporated) was founded in Brunswick in 1914.

==History==

For thousands of years varying cultures of indigenous peoples settled by the Missouri River. At the time of European contact, historical tribes in the area included the Missouri, Osage, Kaw, Otoe and others. In 1723 Etienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont built Fort Orleans near here, established on the Missouri River near the mouth of the Grand River. It was occupied 1723-1726 as the first multi-year European fort and settlement in present-day Missouri. It was to be a trading centerpiece of &quot;La Louisiane,&quot; the new territory claimed by the French.

Following the Louisiana Purchase and the end of the French colonial period the area saw a large influx of immigrants from the U.S., especially Kentucky and Tennessee. They brought African-American slaves and slaveholding traditions with them. The new land owners planted and cultivate crops similar to those in the Upper South: hemp and tobacco. Chariton was one of several counties along the Missouri River to become known as Little Dixie.

The original town of Brunswick was laid out in 1836 by James Keyte. Keyte, an English immigrant and Methodist minister, was also the founder of Keytesville, Missouri, the county seat of Chariton County. It was named after Brunswick, in England. The original town plat was about 500 yards (457 meters) south of its current location, but due to changes in the Missouri and Grand rivers, the location is now underwater. A Mr. Keyte established the first store in the town, and its first industry, a sawmill. Early growth was slow for the community, with the population estimated at around 125 citizens by 1840. However, in the early 1840s a large influx of new residents increased the size of the town and scope of business offerings. They included a hotel, a wagon maker, brick factory, and a pork packing facility. Doctor Edwin Price, brother of famed Confederate general Sterling Price, was an early settler. In the decades leading up to the American Civil War surrounding counties had no railroad over which to ship or receive goods and crops, thus Brunswick with its steamboat access, became a regional trading center. In 1849 Brunswick recorded 534 arrivals and departures by steamboats. The first school was established at Brunswick in June 1840 with approximately thirty-five students and a one-room log schoolhouse. It was also in 1840 that the first wave of German immigrants arrived in the Brunswick area. Another influx of Germans took place in 1842. &quot;The Brunswicker&quot;, the town&#x27;s first newspaper, began publication in October 1847 and continues today, making it one of the state&#x27;s oldest. Brunswick&#x27;s first bank, a branch of the Merchants Bank of St. Louis, opened.

After the Civil War and the loss of their slaves, farmers shifted to other less labor-intensive, crops. However, in 1880 Chariton County still led the state of Missouri in tobacco production, with 14 million pounds harvested. After nearly ten years of delay due to the war, the railroad finally reached Brunswick in 1867, reducing the reliance on steamboats to transport goods and people.

Dr. W.W. Bowen established the Brunswick Institute of Pharmacy in 1910. The school would train more than 5,000 pharmacists and druggists before closing in 1937. In 1914, farmers organized the Missouri Farmers Association (MFA), a cooperative, based in Brunswick. It has since moved to Columbia, Missouri. Brunswick saw a growth of industry through the mid-20th century, with the construction of an alfalfa-drying plant constructed in 1939, the Chariton Electric Company in 1958, in 1965 the opening of the Tuloma Fertilizer blending plant, and in 1970 a glove factory. Also in 1965 the U.S. Coast Guard built a small base near Brunswick to service increased river traffic; however, the facility was relatively short-lived, closing in March 1973.

Following World War II, Brunswick became the center of an area of pecan groves. In 1972 State Representative Creason secured a state resolution naming Brunswick the Pecan Capital of Missouri. The Brunswick Pecan Festival was first held in 1980, celebrating the large number of pecans being harvested in the area. It would become an annual tradition that is held each October. The world&#x27;s largest 20th-century pecan—a concrete replica—is located along Highway 24 in downtown Brunswick. It measures seven by twelve feet and weighs twelve thousand pounds. It was constructed in 1982 by George James in honor of the Starking Hardy Giant pecan, which he discovered on his property in 1947.

Locust Hill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

==Education==
Schools in the Brunswick area date back to 1840, when a small one-room log &quot;subscription&quot; or private school was constructed. Following the Civil War, attention turned more toward public education, with the first public school opening in the town &quot;circa&quot; 1868. A large three-story brick school was constructed in 1871 and served the community well into the early 20th century, being replaced by a new school in 1930–31. The present junior high / high school building used by Brunswick R-II school district was constructed in 1956–57. The most recent addition to the facilities is a new grade school constructed in 1991–1992.
In 1949 Missouri reorganized public education, with the state board of education consolidating or reorganizing many small rural schools into larger districts, this gave birth to the aforementioned Brunswick R-II district. The district, in student count, is the second largest in Chariton County, trailing Salisbury schools. Enrollment in all grades from 2006 to 2010 averaged 250 students. The school colors are red and black. Their mascot is the Wildcat. Brunswick R-II participates in sports and other activities as a Class 1A school under guidelines from the Missouri State High School Activities Association.

The town has a lending library, the Brunswick Area Public Library.

<text>Dalton is a village in Chariton County, Missouri, United States. The population was 7 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
Dalton is located at (39.397130, -92.991248).

==History of Dalton==
Lewis and Clark made camp at what would later be known as the Cut-Off on June 12, 1804, and it was here that the expedition met with Pierre Dorion, a man who had reportedly been with the Sioux for 20 years and was thought to have some influence upon them. The Lewis and Clark journal entry describes the Dalton Cut-Off as connected to the Missouri River by a creek.

More than sixty years after the Lewis and Clark Expedition passed through the area—after the end of the Civil War—the village of Dalton was born when the railroad created a need for it. The village was named for William Dalton, who had donated the and a railroad depot was built for the St. Louis &amp; Pacific line. [note: William Dalton was believed to be the grandfather of Missouri&#x27;s sitting governor at the time the village was named, but the contributor has not yet found sources to support that claim.]
===Dalton Vocational School===

Dalton is best known as the site of the Dalton Vocational School, originally the Barlett Agricultural and Industrial School, also referred to as the &quot;Tuskegee of the Midwest&quot; or &quot;Missouri Tuskegee&quot;. It was founded in 1907 by Nathaniel Bruce, a student and disciple of Booker T. Washington. The first permanent building was erected in 1909 after flooding forced a move to higher ground. In 1923, the school received funds from the state legislature to construct a model farm home, trade shop, and hog and poultry houses. Eventually the campus would expand to . Bruce shared Washington&#x27;s view that a practical education for African American youth was best. The emphasis was on vocational and agricultural training. African American students from a relatively wide geographical area were bussed to Dalton where they studied agriculture, industrial arts, and home economics.

The demonstration farm and school came under the supervision of the University of Missouri College of Agriculture in 1924. Eventually Lincoln University, a then all-Black college in Jefferson City, took control of the school. The Supreme Court&#x27;s 1954 ruling that schools were to be integrated forced the closing of Dalton Vocational School; the last school year was 1955–1956. Buildings and property were later sold at auction. The campus has sat empty since that time and all but two of the buildings are gone.
===Recent===
Large portions of the 1973 Tom Sawyer film were filmed at the Dalton Cut-Off, especially footage that featured shots of Tom and Huck&#x27;s adventures on the Mississippi River.

In 1979, Dalton resident Rod Skillman was a walk-on for the Missouri football team at defensive tackle and later played professionally for the New Jersey Generals (&#x27;83–&#x27;84) and Hamilton Tiger-Cats (&#x27;84–&#x27;92).

As for the village of Dalton today, the decline of the rural economy and flooding have taken their toll. The 1993 flood reduced Dalton to a grain elevator, a post office, two churches, a community center and a few houses. But the small community still celebrates its heritage with the annual Dalton Days festival.

Today, the Dalton Cut-Off is part of what waterfowl enthusiasts call the &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; because it winters an exceptionally large number of birds.

Dalton Vocational School Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002.

<text>Keytesville is a city in and the county seat of Chariton County, Missouri, United States. The population was 440 as of the 2020 census. Keytesville is the hometown of U.S. Army General Maxwell D. Taylor, who commanded the &quot;Screaming Eagles&quot; 101st Airborne division during the Normandy invasion of World War II. Confederate General Sterling Price, who attacked Keytesville during an unsuccessful cavalry raid across his home state, had previously operated a hotel there.

==History==

The town is named for James Keyte, an Englishman and Methodist preacher who purchased a large parcel of land in 1830 and, two years later, donated fifty acres of it to Chariton County to establish a seat of county government. Until then, county business had been conducted from &quot;Old Chariton,&quot; a village near the confluence of the Chariton and Missouri Rivers that was plagued by disease-spreading mosquitoes and subject to repeated flooding.

James Keyte constructed the first home in Keytesville, and the first business as well. Both were log structures, with the second doubling as a post office. Keyte also created the town&#x27;s first industry when he constructed a mill near his home on Mussel Fork Creek.

The first courthouse was constructed in Keytesville between 1833 and 1834. As a two-story, four-room brick building, it survived until September 20, 1864, when it was burned down by Confederate raiders during the American Civil War.

Isaac Redding added Keytesville&#x27;s first hotel in August 1842.

Keytesville was incorporated on February 3, 1868, by the state of Missouri, and incorporated as a Missouri 4th-class city in March 1883.

===Confederate raid===
On September 20, 1864, Confederate General Sterling Price arrived on the outskirts of Keytesville with a force of 250 men, among them George Todd and other members of Quantrill&#x27;s Raiders under the command of Major John Thrailkill. This action was part of Price&#x27;s 1864 campaign that extended across the state from eastern Missouri to the Kansas City area. When Thrailkill&#x27;s force arrived, Keytesville was defended by a small Union detachment of 35 men from the Missouri militia, commanded by Lieutenant Anthony Pleyer. Many local residents were sympathetic to the Confederate cause. Early on the morning of September 20, under a flag of truce, Thrailkill demanded the surrender of the Union troops, promising fair treatment. Unable to persuade his men to fight, Pleyer surrendered. Price paroled the Union garrison, and six men promptly joined his force. Confederate forces then briefly occupied the town, commandeering supplies from various merchants, burning down the courthouse, and executing Chariton County sheriff Robert Carmon and William Young, a Union scout and alleged spy.

===Late 19th century===
In February 1866, a contract was awarded for construction of a replacement courthouse, a two-story brick building with cupola. Built at a cost of $40,000, it would serve the county until it was destroyed by fire on August 27, 1973. By the mid-1890s, Keytesville had an estimated population of about 1,100 citizens and two newspapers, the &quot;Chariton Courier&quot; and &quot;Keytesville Signal&quot;. Businesses included the Keytesville Roller Mill, a large water-powered grist mill on Mussel Fork Creek; two banks; a building and loan association; two hotels; a distillery; general mercantiles; and restaurants. Because of the town&#x27;s location north of the Wabash Railroad line, Keytesville merchants encouraged the construction, in 1889, of a streetcar line. Hugo Bartz and J. J. Moore, secured land and financing for the project, which when completed consisted of two miles of track and a large barn for horses and rolling stock, constructed for a cost of $10,000. Two horse-drawn passenger coaches and a large flatcar for freight delivered new arrivals at the Wabash depot to the town.

===Keytesville today===
The town has a business district, a public library, and chamber of commerce, swimming pool, insurance sales, bank, convenience store, law offices, chiropractor, restaurant, auto repair, agricultural services and medical clinic. The town has various service clubs and organizations, including the Lions Club. There are three sites in Keytesville listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the First Presbyterian Church, the Chariton County Jail and Sheriff&#x27;s Residence, and the Redding-Hill House. Price Park has a statue of Sterling Price sculpted by Allen George Newman. A new Chariton County Courthouse was constructed in Keytesville in the summer of 1974 and occupied the following July.

==Government==
Keytesville, a Missouri 4th-class city, governs by a mayor-council system. Voters elect two aldermen from two wards, each serving a two-year term, and a mayor at-large, also for a two-year term. The Keytesville Fire District, a volunteer force, provides fire protection for the town and surrounding rural area. law enforcement duties are handled by the Chariton County Sheriff&#x27;s Department. The department headquarters and county jail are located in Keytesville. The city of Keytesville operates two parks. One of the parks provides camping with full hookup available.

==Education==

Keytesville R-III School district serves the town of Keytesville and surrounding rural area. Education in the community dates to before the Civil War, but records indicating the exact date were lost in an 1861 fire at the county clerk&#x27;s office. In 1889, what might be considered the first modern-style school, a large 2-story building, was erected at a cost of $13,000. By 1909, Keytesville school was rated a first-class school by the state of Missouri. In 1949, a large number of the rural schools were combined with Keytesville to form the current district. The current high school was constructed in 1959, with the current elementary school added in 1967. In 2010, the district had a total of 153 students K-12, and a graduation rate of 90-percent. The school mascot is the Tiger and school colors are black and gold. Keytesville competes athletically in the Carroll-Livingston Activities Association. Its enrollment places the Tigers in Class 1 under Missouri State High School Activities Association guidelines.

<text>Mendon is a city in western Chariton County, Missouri, United States. The population was 163 at the 2020 census. It is 21 miles northwest of the county seat Keytesville and 13 miles north of Brunswick, Missouri, on Missouri Route 11.

==History==

Mendon was laid out a mile and a quarter from its current location in 1871 by Christopher Shupe. Shupe named it for his previous home place, Mendon, Illinois. The area had been known as Salt Creek and businesses were in operation several years prior to the town plat actually being filed. Among the earliest was a general store built around 1865 by Mr. Bostich and Mr. Eastman. A Methodist Church was erected in 1866. A sawmill was located five miles east of the town.

In 1867, Jeremiah Andrews Felt, of Quincy, in Adams County, Illinois, not far from Mendon Township, sent his twin sons, William Winsor Felt and Winslow Leach Felt, aged 22, with their 16-year-old brother George Washington Felt, to establish farms on 80 acres to the northwest of where the original Mendon would be laid out four years later in 1871. The Felt twins later acquired 320 acres from the Hannibal &amp; St. Joseph Railroad, and were named as &quot;farmers and stock-raisers being among the first settlers of the area.” Their brother George went to Iowa. Then, Winslow Leach, his wife Annetta Brown, and son Arthur Stanley all died. After their deaths, Charles Davis Felt (1858-1949), the youngest of the Felt brothers, arrived by 1880 to take over the farm.
With the coming of the Chicago, Santa Fe and California Railway, a subsidiary of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, in the late 1880s, the citizens of Mendon were faced with a monumental choice. The rail line was projected to pass by over a mile away. Thus when the railroad tracks were laid in 1887 and 1888, the citizens could remain where they were and miss the direct connection to the railroad, or they could move. On January 13, 1888, the Mendon Land &amp; Trust purchased land from the Felt brothers and a new Mendon was created at the current site; the former location was mostly abandoned. The Felts donated a parcel upon which the high school was built for the blossoming community. &quot;The new town was laid out consisting of 20 square blocks. The town sits parallel to the railroad tracks and thus isn’t square north and south. Businesses started to move from Old Mendon and the town began to prosper. In 1890, the Articles of Corporation were filed and accepted by the County Court. Mendon Cemetery is still where it was in 1860, a part of Old Mendon. The post office began operation in 1872 and continued today.&quot; Sebastian Joseph bought Lot No. 16 in Block 3 for $145.00 on the following conditions: &quot;That intoxicating liquors shall never be bargained, sold, bartered, traded or otherwise disposed of as a beverage in any place of public resort in or on said premises.&quot; If these conditions should be violated, the property would revert back to the Land Company. Frank Newcomer and a Mr. Holworthy put up the first buildings. Newcomer started a lumber yard and hardware store. Later Eli Ward started an implement business and businesses from &quot;Old Mendon&quot; began to move to the new town.

The year following the city&#x27;s move, in 1889, Emil Loew, a harness maker from Tramelan, Switzerland, and wife German-British Mary Groetecke arrived in Mendon from Brookfield to set up a shop and home. Their daughter Bernah married Chester Arthur Felt in 1909, both resided in Mendon until their deaths. Their sons were Arthur Emil Felt and Charles Woodrow Felt. &quot;The town site originally belonged to William and Charles Felt...Later Eli Ward embarked in the implement business, and the business interests of Old Mendon began to move to the new town…. It had a church, public school, a bank, two hotels, a newspaper, The Citizen, and about twenty other businesses, both large and small, including shops and stores. Population 1899: 350.&quot; A newspaper, the &quot;Mendon Citizen&quot;, was first published in 1886. By 1899, the community contained over 20 stores, a school, a bank, and two hotels. The estimated population in the late 1890s was 350 residents. Its population in 1910 was 408 residents.

===Today===
On June 27, 2022, Amtrak&#x27;s Southwest Chief derailed nearly a mile southwest of Mendon, after hitting a dump truck. The city and surrounding community were applauded for their assistance to the injured. &quot;There were farmers, off-duty nurses, truck drivers, soccer moms, Little League coaches and grade-schoolers. They were doling out food, first aid, bottled water and, most importantly, phone chargers.&quot;

A full year before the tragedy, a Mendon resident met with Chariton County engineers and stakeholders to warn them of the dangerous &quot;steep incline leading up to the crossing.&quot; The crossing remains closed as of June 2023.Although freight trains on the Santa Fe railroad still pass through regularly, little remains of Mendon&#x27;s business community.

Education for the town and surrounding rural area is provided by Northwestern High School. The school&#x27;s athletic and academic teams compete in Missouri Class 1, the smallest of all classifications.

Mendon&#x27;s proximity to the Swan Lake National Wildlife Refuge has proven a source of income for the community, with business catering to waterfowl hunters who come to the region.

==Geography==
Mendon is located in western Chariton County on Missouri Route 11. Yellow Creek flows past the northwest side of the town and the Swan Lake National Wildlife Refuge is two miles west. The Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad line passes the northwest side of the community. This line is now owned by the BNSF Railway as the Southern Transcon. The Amtrak Southwest Chief passes through without stopping.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<text>Salisbury is a city in Chariton County, Missouri, United States. The population was 1,563 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The land where Salisbury is now located was first owned by Prier Bibo, a veteran of the War of 1812. In 1819, a tract of 360 acres was granted to Bibo by the U.S. government as a bonus for his military service. Following two intermediate owners, the land was sold for $400 to Judge Lucius Salisbury in 1856. He had surveyors lay out the town plat in 1857, and the town was founded on April 1, 1867.

Salisbury has had a post office since 1863, when Judge Salisbury opened it in his home. He also ran the stagecoach stop from his business, known as &quot;Stop-A-While.&quot;

By the 1870 U.S. Census, Salisbury&#x27;s population was 626. Just two years later, the town was struck by a large tornado. Major fires damaged much of the business district in 1877 and again in 1882. On April 4, 1882, Salisbury was organized and chartered as a fourth-class city under Missouri laws.

Early businesses included two hotels, a flour mill, three tobacco factories, three manufacturers of agricultural equipment and some forty other assorted merchants in the latter 19th century. Residents could visit the Salisbury Opera House, where the town&#x27;s location on the Wabash rail line came into play, conveniently bringing in notable performers of the time. A published 1896 history of Chariton County lists among the community&#x27;s businesses and amenities two newspapers, six physicians, a soda-pop factory, cigar factory, and a city-owned power plant for electricity.

The Salisbury Square Historic District and Frabrishous and Sarah A. Thomas House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Government==
Salisbury is governed by a mayor-council form of government and is a 4th class city under Missouri classification. City council meetings are held the second Thursday of each month. In 2008 Salisbury&#x27;s downtown area underwent major sidewalk and road work, with replica early 20th-century-style streetlights installed. Fire protection is provided by the Salisbury Fire Department, a volunteer-based organization. A paid police department provides law enforcement services.

==Education==

The Salisbury R-IV school district provides K-12 education to the town of Salisbury and a portion of surrounding Chariton County. A major renovation and expansion project in 2010 and 2011 added more class space to the facility. Along with classrooms, construction of a tornado-safe multipurpose area including a new gymnasium is ongoing. Athletic teams from Salisbury High School have won multiple Missouri state championships: 1997 Class 1A football, 2001 and 2002 Class 2A softball, 2004 Class 1A boys&#x27; golf, 2012 Class 1A girls&#x27; cross county, and 2012–2013 Class 2A boys&#x27; basketball.

The first school in Salisbury opened in April 1867, with 108 students. A fire in 1888 destroyed the first school building and it was replaced by a much larger two-story brick structure. In addition to the public school, Salisbury Academy, opened in 1888, provided for higher education at what today would be considered a junior college level. North Missouri Institute, another college-preparatory school, opened in 1891.

Salisbury has a public library, the Dulany Memorial Library.

==Geography==
Salisbury is located at the intersection of US Route 24 and Missouri Route 129. Keytesville is approximately seven miles to the west and Clifton Hill is about seven miles to the east in adjacent Randolph County along Route 24. The Middle Fork of the Little Chariton River flows past the southeast side of the city.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<text>Sumner is a city in Chariton County, Missouri, United States. The population was 78 at the 2020 census. It was named in honor of U.S. Senator Charles Sumner.

==History==
The area along the Grand River in the northwest corner of present-day Chariton County was first explored by two sons of Daniel Boone and Thomas Stanley prior to Missouri statehood in 1821. Stanley established a trading post some time later near what would eventually become Sumner. Other than the trading post not much existed in the area for several years, partly due to marshlands and flooding on the Grand River. The area around Sumner was originally known as Crossland, and about one mile away was the much larger village of Cunningham. However the coming of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad to the community combined with the Wabash railroad&#x27;s decision to move their depot from Cunningham to Sumner gave the latter the upper hand in growth. Sumner was laid out by Joel H. Wilkerson in June, 1882. That fall the first home was constructed in the new village by J.M. Vanes, soon followed by the Commercial Hotel. A newspaper, the &quot;Sumner Star&quot;, was established in 1890 and operated for several years. Once teeming with wildlife such as prairie chicken, turkey, duck, and deer in the 1800s, the population of such was drastically reduced by over hunting and draining of the native wetlands, notably Hog Lake in 1911. In 1937 concerned over wetland preservation in the wake of the Dust Bowl, the U.S. Congress established the Swan Lake National Wildlife Refuge just to the south of Sumner. Roads, buildings and man-made wetlands were soon created by the Civilian Conservation Corps and by 1941 eight hundred geese wintered in the area.
Located on a migratory flyway, Swan Lake and the Sumner area began to attract ever larger numbers of geese in the mid and late 20th century, reaching 100,000 or more by the 1980s and 1990s. This also led to a yearly influx of hunters, benefiting the few Sumner businesses and Chariton County as a whole. With these numbers in mind Sumner was proclaimed the &quot;Wild Goose Capital of the World&quot;. Sumner also began to hold a yearly Goose Festival in 1955 and it continues each October, with a variety of activities held including live music, a queen contest, food and a parade. Sumner residents commissioned a Kansas City sculptor in 1976 to create a large statue to honor the community&#x27;s status and reputation for waterfowl hunting. What resulted was the &quot;Worlds Largest Goose&quot;. Named &quot;Maxie&quot;, the fiberglass and metal structure stands over forty feet tall with a wingspan of sixty-five feet and a total weight of over 5,000 pounds.

==Geography==
Sumner is located at (39.656342, -93.243426).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<doc id="122609" wikidata="Q952547" url="?curid=122609" title="Clever, Missouri">
<text>Clever is a city in Christian County, Missouri, United States. The population was 2,139 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Springfield, Missouri Metropolitan Statistical Area. Clever, like the rest of Christian County, saw a significant increase in population between 2000 and 2010.

==Geography==
Clever is located on the Springfield Plateau of the Missouri Ozarks, southwest of Springfield at an elevation of . The town lies in the western panhandle of Christian County, just south of Missouri Highway 14 between Nixa and Billings. The town of Republic and the Wilson&#x27;s Creek National Battlefield are approximately six miles to the north and northeast.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==History==
Lincoln Township and the land that would eventually become the town of Clever remained largely unsettled for many years after Missouri became a state in 1821. A U.S. Government land survey wasn&#x27;t conducted until 1834, and the first land transaction wasn&#x27;t registered until 1845. The coming of more settlement to southwest Missouri also came with the Old Wire Road. Following a portion of the Great Osage Trail, the road extended from St. Louis, Missouri southwest to Fort Smith, Arkansas passing through Springfield, Missouri and on through Christian county. Along with supply trains and settlers headed for Fort Smith. The Butterfield Overland Mail Route 1858-1861 period passed through after a change of horses at Ashmore Station. Butterfield Overland Mail A telegraph line ran along the same route as well, giving rise to its name.

 Prior to Clever&#x27;s existence as a town, a Civil War battle took place nearby. On August 2, 1861, the Battle of Dug Springs pitted the Union forces of General Nathaniel Lyon against the numerically superior combined Confederate forces of General Benjamin McCulloch, Arkansas State Troops under General Nicholas Bartlett Pearce, and Missouri State Guard under General (and Missouri Governor) Sterling Price. The battle, along present-day Old Wire Road, was the first time during the Missouri Campaign of 1861 that the Union &quot;Army of the West&quot; and Confederate forces met in conflict. Despite being outnumbered more than two to one, Lyon&#x27;s Union forces prevailed in the battle. The clash is seen as a precursor to the much larger and strategically important Battle of Wilson&#x27;s Creek eight days later.

Following the end of the Civil War, a road from Springfield to Billings, Missouri crossed Old Wire Road, and it was this crossroads that gave rise to Clever. Farmer Ike Teague constructed a two-story home at the crossroads around 1890. A short time later a physician, Doctor Bishop, purchased the home and constructed a building across the road with the intent of opening a drug store and mercantile. However he died unexpectedly before completion. It would sit vacant until a year later, around 1894, William Wilson purchased the building and opened the first store in the future Clever. The first post office was established in the store in 1896 with Frank Netzer—now the store&#x27;s proprietor—as postmaster.

When the first choice for a post office name was rejected by the Federal government, Mr. Netzer surveyed customers and one, Tom Lentz, suggested &quot;Clever&quot; because the young community&#x27;s residents were friendly and wise. Growth of the small crossroads village was slow at first. A blacksmith shop, second store building, and meeting hall had been constructed by 1902 and a tomato-canning factory established in 1904.

The next year, surveyors for the Missouri Pacific Railroad laid out a route from Springfield to Crane, Missouri that passed through Clever. It was at this same time the plat for Clever was officially surveyed and laid out. A 300-foot-deep well was drilled for community use and operated by a small gasoline engine until electricity came to Clever in 1928. By 1908 the growing town featured many new business spurred by the railroad, including a hotel, lumber yard, photography studio, a bank, movie theater, flour mill, and several mercantile and hardware establishments. With this rapid growth residents felt it time to officially organize as a municipality and petitioned the Christian County court, which granted the request and appointed Clever&#x27;s first board of trustees in February, 1909.

In 1910, Clever&#x27;s first documented population in the United States Census was 248. Its location on the railroad meant an opportunity for entertainment not normal for a typical small town of the era. A series of Chautauqua events over the course of several summers entertained the residents, as did famed showman and Wild West figure William &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody in 1913. Famed ragtime composer and pianist Blind Boone also performed in concert at the Clever school gym. Through the first half of the 20th century the population remained relatively stable around or slightly below 500 residents. However between 1990 and 2000 the population nearly doubled from 580 to 1,010., and then more than doubled between 2000 and 2010 rising from 1,010 to 2,139. On May 4, 2003, a series of tornadoes passed by the outer reaches of the town. The tornado outbreak resulted in major property damage, numerous livestock deaths, and one human fatality.

A two-room, two-story brick building, it served to educate students from a number of previous small rural one-room school houses, including the Pleasant Hope school previously one half mile north of Clever. Additions were made in 1912 and 1916 that allowed the education to go up to tenth grade. In 1919 Blooming Grove and Taylor schools merged with Clever to form the Consolidated District Number 5. In 1920 it became a four-year high school.

A fire in the spring of 1931 destroyed the building; however, a larger two-story brick building was built in time for the following school year. Merges with several small rural districts in the mid-20th century led to the creation of the current Clever R-V (5) school district. The district now provides pre-Kindergarten through 12th grade education to the community and rural portions of Christian County. In 2010–11 school year, there were 1,119 students enrolled in the Clever R-V school district.

== History ==

The area was first settled by farmers who located their farms along the wooded streams near present-day Nixa. The area became a crossroads, as it was a half-day ride with a team of horses from Springfield. Teamsters found it a convenient stopover site when hauling freight between Springfield and Arkansas. The village became known as Faughts. An early resident, Nicholas A. Inman, was a blacksmith from Tennessee, who set up a shop in 1852. When a post office was opened, a town meeting was held to decide on a name for the new community. Because of his years of service to the community, the town was suggested to be named for him. Another suggestion was &quot;nix&quot; because the community was &quot;nothing but a crossroads&quot;. The name Nix was finally decided upon, and Inman&#x27;s middle initial &quot;a&quot; was added to get the unique name of Nixa. The village incorporated on June 10, 1902.

==History==
Ozark was named after the Ozark Mountains, in which it is situated. The Ozark Courthouse Square Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.

The name Ozarks is believed to have begun sometime in the late 1700s or early 1800s from those living in the Arkansas area who were heading north and said they were going to the Ozarks.

The first settler to visit the area is believed to be Henry Schoolcraft, who arrived in 1818. During that time he extensively studied the geological makeup of the area and noted the high concentration of lead and zinc. Notably, in the Elk Valley area. Schoolcraft noted on the abundance of elk, bear and other wildlife in the area. This later became the area&#x27;s hunting grounds, until the elk were hunted to extinction in the 1880s.

Most of the lead and zinc mines functioned until the early 1900&#x27;s. The majority of the mining done in Ozark, Missouri was done in the Elk Valley area.

==History==
Founded on October 22, 1887, by the Santa Fe Railroad, Revere was &quot;probably named in honor of Paul Revere.&quot; During the period prior to 1900, Revere flourished as an intermediate stop for the railroad. In 1898, Revere was incorporated as a city in the 4th class of Missouri.

In 1898, J. H. Talbott of Luray started the &quot;Revere Weekly Current&quot;, a weekly newspaper that consisted of five pages of world and local news including advertisements, train schedules and local markets. Circulation closed on July 18, 1901, when Talbott left for law school.

Located at the former site of the Revere Methodist Church, Ar-Del Park was dedicated on May 30, 1946, as a memorial to Revere natives John Arnold Wallace and Delmar Brown, who died serving their country during World War II. A large boulder with a plaque dedicated to all Clark County veterans is located in the park.

On July 26, 2011, the United States Postal Service announced plans to consider closing the Revere post office as part of a nationwide restructuring plan. On May 9, 2012, it was announced that a new strategy would preserve the nation&#x27;s smallest post offices, reversing the earlier plan.

==Education==
 Revere High School was started in 1923 with a single student, Lula Riley. In 1925, a new building was dedicated for grades K–12. In 1988, the graduating class had two students. After several years of declining enrollment the final high school class graduated in 2002 with five students. The building was then used for K–8 students, with grades 9–12 attending Clark County R-1 high school in Kahoka. Continued declining enrollment led to a vote in April 2012 that resulted in the decision to close the school and annex it to the Clark County R-1 school district effective July 1, 2012.

Despite having one of the smallest high school enrollments in the state of Missouri, the purple and white Bulldogs fielded four Missouri State High School Athletic Association state-qualifying teams. Baseball teams from 1977, 1981 and 1982 and the 1997 girls&#x27; basketball team reached the state playoffs.

<text>Gladstone is a city in Clay County, Missouri, United States and a suburb of Kansas City. The City of Gladstone is located about 10–20 minutes from downtown Kansas City, and about 10–20 minutes from Kansas City International Airport. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 27,063. It is part of the Kansas City metropolitan area.

==History==
Settled as the area of Linden, Gladstone formally incorporated under the Missouri Constitution by popular vote in November 1952. The purpose of formation was to avoid being annexed by Kansas City.

A remnant of the mesic forested land on which Gladstone is built is preserved as the Maple Woods Natural Area, a park within Gladstone that is a National Natural Landmark. The Atkins-Johnson Farmhouse Property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.

==Government==
Under state statute, Gladstone is a city of the third class. It has a council-manager form of government. The City Council consists of five members popularly elected every three years, with staggered terms in office. The mayor presides over council meetings, appoints members to resident boards and commissions, meets with constituents, and signs ordinances, resolutions, contracts, and agreements authorized by the council. The City Manager administers city operations and implements policies set by the City Council.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The city is connected to nearby North Kansas City and Kansas City proper by Routes 1 and 283 as well as nearby U.S. Route 169, which sits less than 1.5 miles from the city&#x27;s western border. I-29 runs near the city&#x27;s southernmost tip shortly after its initial break from I-35. A handful of small subdivisions maintain independent municipalities along North Oak Trafficway, a road which is host to much of the area&#x27;s shopping. The city is rectangular in shape, with the city limits generally extending from NE Englewood Road or NE 55th to NE 77th south to north, and N. Jackson Ave. to N. Broadway east to west. The city boundaries include a panhandle that goes south to NW 44th St. and from NW Briarcliff Ln. to Gladstone Waterworks Rd. from east to west. A portion of the panhandle was de-annexed by Kansas City and annexed by Gladstone in 2005 to bring the Gladstone Water Plant property within the Gladstone city limits.

There are four small enclaves in the southwest of the city. From the north they are Oakview, Oakwood Park, Oakwood, and Oaks.

<text>Kearney is a city in Clay County, Missouri, United States. The population per the 2020 U.S. census was 10,404. The city was the birthplace of Jesse James, and there is an annual festival in the third weekend of September to recognize the outlaw. It is part of the Kansas City metropolitan area.

==History==
Kearney was unofficially founded in the spring of 1856 by David T. Duncan and W. R. Cave, and was originally called Centerville. Centerville was composed of what is now the southeastern portion of the town. In 1867, John Lawrence began laying out plans for another small settlement around the newly established Kansas City and Cameron Railroad subsidiary of the Hannibal and Saint Joseph Railroad which was to build the Hannibal Bridge establishing Kansas City, Missouri as the dominant city in the region. The president of the railroad was Charles E. Kearney (although there is speculation that it was named after Kearney, Nebraska). The railroad still operates as the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway. As they grew, the two settlements of Centerville and Kearney were effectively merged, and the town of Kearney, Missouri was officially incorporated in 1869.

The Claybrook House (since destroyed in a fire) and James Brothers&#x27; House and Farm are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Geography and climate ==
Kearney is located in north central Clay County northeast of the Kansas City metropolitan area. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

=== Climate ===

The city lies in Tornado Alley, a region of the United States that is extremely prone to tornadoes and severe thunderstorms. Generally, most of this severe weather activity occurs in the spring and summer, although severe weather can and has occurred even in the winter months.

== Demographics ==

== History ==

Liberty was settled in 1822, and shortly later became the county seat of Clay County. The city was named for the American concept of liberty.

In 1830, David Rice Atchison established a law office in Liberty. He was joined three years later by colleague Alexander William Doniphan. The two argued cases defending the rights of Mormon settlers in Jackson County, served Northwest Missouri in Missouri&#x27;s General Assembly, and labored for the addition of the Platte Purchase to Missouri&#x27;s boundaries.

In October 1838, the two were ordered by Governor Lilburn Boggs to arrest Mormon founder Joseph Smith Jr. at the Far West settlement in Caldwell County. Immediately after the conclusion of the Mormon War, Smith and other Mormon leaders were incarcerated at the Liberty Jail for the winter as Doniphan labored for a quicker trial date. Although Doniphan led a force of Missouri volunteers ordered to capture the leaders, he defended Joseph Smith in trial and won him a change in venue. While en route to their new venue, Smith and his followers escaped and left Missouri for the new Mormon settlement in Nauvoo, Illinois.

<text>North Kansas City is a city in Clay County, Missouri, United States. It is also enclaved in Kansas City. Even though the name is similar to its larger counterpart, Kansas City, it is an independent municipality and part of the Kansas City metropolitan area. The population was 4,467 at the 2020 census. Originally a northern suburb across the Missouri River from Kansas City, it is now almost completely surrounded by Kansas City, which has annexed far to the north of North Kansas City&#x27;s northern city limits. North Kansas City also adjoins the small municipality of Avondale.

==History==
A post office called North Kansas City was established in 1891. The town lies north of Kansas City, hence the name.
Large scale development of the area was not possible before the construction of levees protecting North Kansas City from flooding from the Missouri River. The levee on the north bank of the Missouri River was constructed between 1909 and 1912 and is owned and maintained by the North Kansas City Levee District. The city is also protected by a hillside levee.

The city was incorporated on November 4, 1912. A five-member board of trustees was elected in 1914 to oversee municipal affairs. One of the original trustees was William E. Macken, who was elected as the first mayor of North Kansas City in 1924. The city&#x27;s largest park, Macken Park, is named for him.

The Armour Theatre Building, Sears, Roebuck and Company Warehouse Building, and Wheeling Corrugating Company Building are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 2012 North Kansas City celebrated it Centennial with a citywide celebration. Since 2010, the city has seen the openings of two micro breweries, a distillery and a pickleball facility. The new businesses were fueled by the repopulation of downtown Kansas City, just across the Missouri River.

<text>Plattsburg is a city in and the county seat of Clinton County, Missouri and is part of the Kansas City metropolitan area in the western part of the state, within the United States. It developed along the Little Platte River. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 2,222.

== History ==
The area along the rivers has been inhabited for thousands of years by indigenous peoples. Historic Native American tribes in the area included the Ioway, Meskwaki and Sac tribes, who ceded land to the United States in the Platte Purchase. This area became part of northwest Missouri.

The European-American settlers first called their settlement Concord. (This has been used for a contemporary man-made lake and surrounding housing development in the city.) Later the city was renamed Springfield. After the discovery that there was an earlier Springfield, Missouri, settlers named it &quot;Plattsburg,&quot; after Plattsburgh, New York. This is the seat of Clinton County, New York. Both it and Clinton County, Missouri were named for George Clinton, one of the Founding Fathers, the first governor of New York, and vice president of the United States from 1805 to 1812.

The area was settled chiefly by migrants from the Upper South, especially central Kentucky and western Virginia. It was near a region called &quot;Little Dixie&quot; in Missouri because of the strong Southern presence. These migrants brought their slaves and culture with them. For a brief period of time during the 1830s, Plattsburg was home to a Federal land office for areas of northern Missouri that were newly opened to settlement by European Americans after the Platte Purchase in 1836. Until then, Plattsburg was one of the farthest western non-military settlements.

The area became a leading producer of both hemp and tobacco, both major commodity products of the Bluegrass Region of central Kentucky. They were labor-intensive and dependent on labor of enslaved African Americans labor. David Rice Atchison, the US senator from here, was pro-slavery. As the county seat, Plattsburg was a center of trade and politics, with a variety of retail stores and professions. At one point, when Kansas City was a major beef processing and export center, Plattsburg was known as &quot;the Beef Capital of the World&quot;.

By 1860, the county had a total population of 7,848. The 1,144 enslaved African Americans comprised 17% of the total. During the American Civil War, two minor battles took place nearby. The town was occupied by both Confederate and Federal forces. In 1863, elements of William Quantrill&#x27;s guerrilla band captured a unit of Federal troops encamped in the county courthouse located in Plattsburg.

<text>Blackwater is a city in northwest Cooper County, Missouri, United States located along the Blackwater River, from which it takes its name. The population was 162 at the 2010 census.

Founded by the Missouri Pacific Railroad, Blackwater&#x27;s economy was largely defined by freight until the mid-twentieth century. With the railroad&#x27;s decline, Blackwater&#x27;s status as a boom town came to an end, and the population thinned considerably. The city has preserved a number of historic, rail-related structures that have been repurposed as museums, hotels, or antique shops. 

Many parts of Blackwater&#x27;s commercial and residential districts are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
Blackwater was platted in 1887, although it had long functioned as a trading point. A post office called Blackwater has been in operation since 1873.

In the late nineteenth century, the Missouri Pacific Railroad sought to construct a &quot;River Route&quot; to link important sites like Kansas City, Boonville, and Jefferson City. A number of smaller towns and villages sprang up among the route, which provided a vital economic lifeline to otherwise isolated areas. 

As one of these smaller towns, Blackwater retained a small but economically stable population. First consisting of railroad workers, the discovery of a rock quarry several miles outside the town provided a new set of economic opportunities, drawing miners to the area. In subsequent decades, the town would develop drugstores, banks, hardware stores, millinery shops, cafes, a hotel, lumber yard, livery stables, a creamery, meat market, blacksmiths, and saloons.

At the coming of the Second World War, Blackwater had a population of about 650 people, but the economic and social changes of the postwar era presented a new series of challenges. The Missouri Pacific Railroad, which declared bankruptcy during the Great Depression, did not provide the same labor opportunities it had previously. As for many other small towns, Blackwater found itself losing its young people to larger metropolitan areas with available jobs, and the population dwindled.

In 1950 the Blackwater Stone Company, the town&#x27;s largest employer, accidentally hit water while detonating within the quarry, which flooded. This incident forced the permanent closure of the mines, dealing the town another heavy blow. 

By the twenty-first century, Blackwater&#x27;s population and economy had significantly shrunk from their former peaks. To boost the town&#x27;s fortunes, a group of residents formed the Blackwater Preservation Society and began applying to grants to restore or repurpose the town&#x27;s historic buildings. These activities have attracted some tourism to the area, particularly among rail or local history enthusiasts, and support a small number of local businesses. 

The video games &quot;Red Dead Redemption&quot; (2010) and &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot; (2018) include a version of the city.

Blackwater Commercial Historic District, Blackwater Residential Historic District, and Imhoff Archeological Site are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==
Blackwater is located along Missouri Route K two miles north of I-70. The site is on the south bank of the Blackwater River, and the community of Nelson in adjacent Saline County lies two miles to the west-northwest. Lamine is six miles to the southeast on Missouri Route 41.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<text>Boonville is a city and the county seat of Cooper County, Missouri, United States. The population was 7,964 at the 2020 census. The city was the site of a skirmish early in the Civil War, on July 17, 1861. Union forces defeated the Missouri State Guard in the first Battle of Boonville. It is part of the Columbia, Missouri metropolitan area.

==History==
The community derives its name from Nathan and Daniel Morgan Boone, who were the sons of Daniel Boone and established their salt business near the community in the early 1800s, delivering their product from salt licks to St. Louis. The area has been called &quot;Boone&#x27;s Lick&quot; and the route from the lick to St. Charles/St. Louis, Missouri is called the Boone&#x27;s Lick Trail. The eastern terminus near Boonville at Franklin, Missouri is considered the original start of the Santa Fe Trail.

The first pioneers were Hannah and Stephen Cole, who settled in 1810. During skirmishes with Native Americans in the War of 1812 they moved to a fort on the north side of the Missouri River (called on markers as &quot;Hannah Cole Fort&quot;). That fort subsequently became the first county seat of Howard County, Missouri.

After the war, the town was formally laid out in 1817 by Asa Morgan and Charles Lucas. Boonville was named the county seat in 1818.

The community&#x27;s position on the Santa Fe Trail and Missouri River led to many historically important residents during the era of westward expansion, including politicians William Ash (a former slave turned Virginia General Assemblyman), David Barton, George Graham Vest (famous for his &quot;man’s best friend&quot; closing argument in an 1869 trial), and self-taught artist George Caleb Bingham.

The Cooper County Jail was built in 1848 and remained in place until 1979 with a claim that it was the longest-serving jail in Missouri history.

In 1855, Thespian Hall opened, and today claims to be the oldest continuously running theatre west of the Allegheny Mountains.

More than 400 buildings (most in 14 separate historical districts) are listed on National Register of Historic Places listings in Cooper County, Missouri.

During the American Civil War, the community was fought over and held by both Union and Confederate forces, beginning with the Battle of Boonville on June 17, 1861 (a month before the First Battle of Bull Run) which gave the Union control of the Missouri River. The Second Battle of Boonville occurred on September 13, 1861. The community would be captured by Sterling Price in 1864 in Price&#x27;s Raid.

The city was a strategic target because of its location on the Missouri Pacific Railroad. The track was subsequently taken over by the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad. In the 1980s, the track section that traversed the town was converted into parkland, as part of Katy Trail State Park. Today, the &quot;Katy Trail&quot; is the longest rails to trails system in the United States.

In 2008, Anheuser-Busch InBev opened the Warm Springs Ranch east of Boonville as the primary breeding farm for the Budweiser Clydesdales.

== Recreation ==
Boonville is near the middle of the Katy Trail, a 225-mile state park enjoyed by cyclists and hikers. Missouri-Kansas-Texas Bridge in Boonville, which crosses the Missouri near the Isle of Capri Casino and Historic Selwyn Shoe Factory (which has been refurnished as apartments), has been subject of controversy. The Union Pacific Railroad had planned to remove sections of the bridge and reinstall them at Jefferson City, which would sever the route and possibly eliminate the railbank protections and allow the right of way to revert to adjacent property owners. However, Friends of Historic Boonville and others across the state oppose the idea. Governor Jay Nixon announced in 2010 that Union Pacific would transfer ownership of the bridge to the City of Boonville.

Annually, Boonville celebrates Boonville Heritage Days. This is a summer weekend event that focuses on heritage. Activities include a parade, craft booths, a carnival and much fun for people of all ages. On the last evening there is a fireworks show.

Other annual events include the Festival of the Leaves, which is held on the last Saturday in September, and The Festival of The Lights, which is held every Thursday night in September. Shops stay open late, and there are booths with food, free stuff, and games. The historic Thespian Hall, located downtown, is used for concerts, art shows, and plays.

The annual Halloween parade features the award-winning Boonville Silver Pirate Band dressed up in a variety of fanciful maritime costumes.

Twillman Field in Harley Park is also a source of local pride, as it hosts several baseball tournaments every year, including state and regional championships, with ages ranging from 13 to 18. At one time in the late 1980s through 1990s, it was considered by some to be the third best baseball field in the state, trailing only the Major League parks in St. Louis and Kansas City.

==Correctional facility==
The Missouri Training School for Boys, a juvenile correctional facility of the Missouri Division of Youth Services, opened in 1889. By 1948 violent prisoners had killed two boys. As a result, Governor Phil M. Donnelly removed 71 prisoners from the training school and relocated them to an adult prison. He dismissed the board of the State Board for Training Schools, the juvenile correctional authority. It closed in 1983. The facility is now the Boonville Correctional Center, a minimum security, adult institution for men in the Missouri Department of Corrections.

==Education==
The Boonville R-1 School District has four schools. Hannah Cole Elementary, David Barton Elementary, Laura Speed Elliott (LSE) Middle School, and Boonville High School are all located in Boonville. The superintendent of schools is Mark Harvey and the school mascot is the Pirates.

There is also a parochial PreK-8th school Sts. Peter and Paul, which was established in the 1850s and has the Warriors as their mascot.

Boonville has a public library, a branch of the Boonslick Regional Library.

==Media==
Boonville is served by one newspaper, the &quot;Boonville Daily News&quot;. Boonville also has a radio station, KWRT, which airs at 1370 kHz A.M. and 98.7 kHz F.M.
