<text>Lindström (also spelled Lindstrom) is a city in Chisago County, Minnesota, United States, located 35 miles northeast of the Twin Cities. The population was 4,888 at the 2020 census. Lindström&#x27;s motto is &quot;America&#x27;s Little [Sweden]&quot;. U.S. Highway 8 serves as a main route for the community.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Lindström is located from the Wisconsin state line, and less than two hours from cities including Duluth, St. Cloud, and the Twin Cities area. When looking at the town from above, it looks like it could be an island due to the surrounding lakes. The landmass of Lindstrom consists mainly of lakes (including South Lindstrom Lake, North Lindstrom Lake, South Center Lake, North Center Lake and Kroon Lake). With so many lakes, Lindstrom is a destination for fishers from all over the world.

==History==

Lindström was settled predominantly by Swedish (and a few Norwegian) immigrants and their families. In 1853, Daniel Lindstrom left Sweden in search of a nice piece of land to settle in the United States. Lindström was platted in 1880. The town of Lindström was incorporated in 1894. Many other Swedish emigrants traveled with Daniel Lindstrom. Joris Per Anderson, half brother to Daniel Lindstrom came in 1850 leading a party from Hassela, Sweden. In the party was Eric Norelius, whose personal journals in part formed the basis of Vilhelm Moberg&#x27;s novels of the Swedish emigration to the United States, &quot;The Emigrants&quot;. Moberg&#x27;s novels have two main characters, Karl Oskar and Kristina Nilsson. The novels depict the hardships Swedish emigrants endured en route to the United States and their first ten years in their new home country. A bronze statue of the author, holding his bicycle as if ready to ride away, stands on a stepped platform in Chisago City&#x27;s town park. An image of Karl Oskar and Kristina remains Lindström’s logo today. Since 1990, anyone who has taken U.S. Highway 8 from north of Forest Lake to Lindström has driven on the &quot;Moberg Trail&quot;.

Lindström celebrates Karl Oskar and Kristina annually with &quot;Karl Oskar Days&quot;. This event takes place mid-July and includes such activities as the coronation of a &quot;Karl Oskar Ambassadors, parades, a street dance, and fireworks. There are still statues of Karl Oskar and Kristina in Lindström as a tribute to the early Swedish immigrants whose descendants continue to populate the area. These statues are the main attraction for tourists from all over the world who come to Lindström because of its Swedish heritage.

In 1852 or 1853, William Holmes, whose birthplace is unknown, established a farm on the Sunrise Prairie, located on the Sunrise River about a mile south of its mouth at the St. Croix River. John A. Brown from Pennsylvania and Patten W. Davis from Virginia started farming in the vicinity in 1853. That same year, Brown and Patten built a road to St. Paul with the help of Henry L. Ingalls and his wife, Lavina. The couple were natives of Connecticut who had migrated to Illinois and then California before arriving in Sunrise. Mrs. Ingalls was likely the first white woman in Sunrise. Also in 1853, a circuit-riding preacher began holding services in the new settlement. His efforts resulted in the establishment of a congregation that remains to the present day as Sunrise Bible Church.

They included the Collins, Deming, Gwynne, Smith, Starkweather, Wilcox, Wilkes, and Wolleat families. On October 26, 1858, Sunrise was organized as a township. The unincorporated community of Sunrise is still located on the plat of Sunrise City. However, it was never incorporated into a city but remains under township jurisdiction.

Until 1906 Dilworth was a small station with a siding serving two grain elevators and had no depot building or agent. The crowding of the Northern Pacific sites in Fargo necessitated the selection of a new site for divisional terminal facilities and Dilworth was chosen. By July 1906, the Northern Pacific had purchased nearly 500 acres of land around the Dilworth siding for the new headquarters. A main feature of the facility was the roundhouse, a huge building shaped like a donut with a bite out of it. In the center of the donut’s hole was a turntable, like a big Lazy Susan. A locomotive was driven onto the turntable which rotated the engine toward one of 45 stalls. In the stall the locomotive was repaired and refitted. Then the engine backed out onto the turntable and spun about to pull another train back the other direction.

The village grew from practically zero population in mid-1907 to nearly 500 by spring 1910. Establishment of a railroad hotel was necessary to house railroad workers until the town could build up and the workers could move into homes of their own or obtain other places of residence.

In 1911, the village was formally incorporated and established its own government and law enforcement. The first Mayor of Dilworth was F. C. Alsop, with Christian Haugsted the Clerk. In 1918, J. M. Manning was elected Mayor, O. Wirud, Clerk, with M. J. Peirsol appointed Street Commissioner and L. G. Hanson as Treasurer.

The Dilworth Fire Department was established in 1911. The evaluation on October 25, 1928 estimated value of equipment was $1,000. It consisted of 2 extensions, two hose carts and an 18 member volunteer group.

Dilworth’s rapid growth challenged its school system as well. The Clay County Commission approved of School District 81 on March 3, 1896. This encompassed the northeastern quarter of Moorhead Township, home to eight school age children. In 1905, District 81 built a new one-room school a half mile south of today’s Dilworth Community Center. By 1908, the school’s population had ballooned to 93. The District built a new, much larger school just south of the present Dilworth Elementary.

One of the earliest institutions in the new village was the Dilworth Presbyterian Church. Through the efforts of Moorhead Presbyterian minister Dugald McIntyre, the church broke ground May 15, 1907. Their very active ladies aid society raised money through a series of bake sales and socials. When the church was dedicated August 11, the congregation was free of debt. The church still stands. It’s likely the oldest building in Dilworth.

St. Elizabeth’s Catholic Church was slower in coming. According to a typescript history from the church, in 1907, Father Charles Cannon of Moorhead’s St. Joseph’s parish visited the townsite to take a survey of Dilworth’s Catholics and &quot;to determine local interest in forming a mission church.&quot; The effort had limited success, but over the next few years Father Gerard Speilman of St. Joseph’s celebrated mass in private homes. In July 1910, new efforts to form a church began. Less than two months later, the community dedicated a new 35 by 51 foot concrete block church. It served the congregation until the present church was built in 1964.

Businesses quickly sprang up during summer 1907. In late July, Moorhead’s Ballord-Trimble Lumber Company opened a yard at the rapidly growing village. A few days later Olaus Anderson opened a general store on the corner of today’s Center Avenue and Main Street. Two weeks after that, Rasmus Haugsted opened another general store half a block north. In mid-August Haugsted became Dilworth’s first Post Master and ran the Post Office from his store. By 1910, Dilworth was also home to a bank, two hotels, a grocery, a dairy, a meat market, a bakery, at least two restaurants and a barbershop. Some 498 people lived in Dilworth and nearly 70% of them worked for the railroad.

Dilworth, a city in Moorhead Township, incorporated as a village on August 17, 1911; the community began in 1883 as a railroad siding, called Richardson for a few months, then renamed to honor coffee importer Joseph Dilworth, one of the original stockholders and a director of the Northern Pacific Railroad, residing in Pittsburgh, Pa., who purchased 4,000 acres in the vicinity and became one of the largest landholders along the railroad. It was the largest railroad village in western Minnesota when the Northern Pacific Railroad built its depot in section 11 in 1906. The townsite was platted in 1906, and the post office began in 1907. The village was often called Little Italy for the large Italian immigrant group who settled here.

<doc id="119776" wikidata="Q1012341" url="?curid=119776" title="Ulen, Minnesota">
<text>Ulen ( ) is a city in Clay County, Minnesota, United States, along the South Branch of the Wild Rice River. The population was 476 at the 2020 census.

Near this small community, what may be an authentic Viking sword known as the Ulen sword was found in a field by Hans O. Hansen in 1911. The sword is currently on display in the Ulen Museum. Ulen and the area surrounding is mostly inhabited by later generation Norwegian-Americans.

Ulen is the southern terminus of the Agassiz Recreational Trail, a 53-mile multi-use trail built on an abandoned railroad grade which has its northern terminus at Crookston, Minnesota.
As of 2022, the mayor of Ulen is Mary A. Knopfler.

==History==
Ulen Township was named after an early European to settle in the region, Ole Ulen. Ulen was incorporated as a village on November 12, 1896. A meeting was held on June 7, 1881, at the home of Nels Wiger for the purpose of organizing Ulen Township. Robert Hanson, Elias Rost and Ole Mellum were the election judges and Nels Wiger served as the clerk. One of the concerns of the early township officials was the building of roads. There were no tax funds for this purpose so each able-bodied man was required to work for two days a year building roads. The first road was laid out and built in 1883.

The post office was established in 1884, its name changing to Odneland in 1885 for Ole Odneland (Tallak Aaneland), postmaster and general store owner, although it was sometimes spelled Oneland and Onland. When the railroad came in 1886, Odneland&#x27;s (Aaneland&#x27;s) store was in the path of the rails, so it was moved to the east side of the tracks on the northwest corner of Regelstad&#x27;s farm. In 1866, the same year Ulen was incorporated, the Duluth and Manitoba Railway company, a subsidiary of the Northern Pacific Railway, built the railroad between what is now known as Manitoba Junction and Red Lake Falls, taking the railroad directly through Ulen. Ole Asleson platted a townsite, and the name was changed to Ulen with Odneland remaining as postmaster until the post office was reorganized in 1887 and Ole Christian Melbye became postmaster in his grocery store; Melbye moved into the first house built in village limits in 1887. Ulen came to be mostly inhabited by Norwegian immigrants and the town continues to hold on to its Nordic identity.

The Ulen Historical Society was founded in September 1963. In 2004 a new Ulen Historical Society was organized.

The Ulen Historical Society runs the Ulen Museum, home to the Ulen Sword. The Ulen Sword is 19th century sword, once believed to be a Viking sword, which the town takes great pride in. The sword was found by Hans O. Hansen on his farm while plowing in 1911. The former name of the Ulen Museum was the Viking Sword Museum.

The town has been able to grow slowly over the years in part thanks to Northwestern Bank. In 1941, the bank moved to Ulen and changed its name to Northwestern Bank. One of the historic events of the bank occurred in 1958 when the bank reached 1 million dollar figure in deposits. This first branch in Ulen is still economically important.

In 2005 Ulen needed to get the arsenic out of its water. Wells supplying the city&#x27;s water had high concentrations of the chemical-more than twice the treatment standard of less than 10 parts per billion. Also the city was experiencing too many water main breaks, and its aging infrastructure needed replacing. As a result, Moore Engineering planned and designed a gravity filter system to remove arsenic from the water supply and made plans to replace aging water mains. The city&#x27;s new water treatment plant removed arsenic to a level of less than 5 parts per billion, 50 percent more treatment than required. Grants and loans, including a $600,000 grant from the Small Cities Community Development program, helped pay for the improvements, ensuring water safety.

Historically known as an agricultural community, Ulen continues to flourish with the growth of agricultural and small family-owned businesses. West Central Ag Service operates the grain elevator in Ulen

<text>Grand Marais ( ) is a city and the county seat of Cook County, Minnesota, United States, of which it is the only municipality. It is on Lake Superior&#x27;s North Shore. Grand Marais had a population of 1,337 at the 2020 census. Before it was settled by French Canadians and before Minnesota&#x27;s statehood, it was inhabited by the Ojibwe.

The Gunflint Trail, a National Scenic Byway, begins in Grand Marais and ends near the border with Ontario.

==History==
The Ojibwe name for the area is &quot;Gichi-biitoobiig&quot;, which means &quot;great duplicate water,&quot; &quot;parallel body of water&quot; or &quot;double body of water&quot; (like a bayou), a reference to the two bays that form this large harbor of Lake Superior.

The area was a bustling fur trading station in the 1700s, and the French Canadian Voyageurs termed the settled village &quot;Grand Marais&quot; (&quot;Great Marsh&quot;), referring to a marsh that, in early fur-trading times, was 20 acres (8.1 ha) or less in area, nearly at the level of Lake Superior, and at the head of the little bay and harbor that led to the settlement of the village there. Another small bay on the east, less protected from storms, is separated from the harbor by a slight projecting point and a short beach. &quot;Grand Marais&quot; also may mean &quot;sheltered water area&quot;, as the harbor has natural breakwall rock outcroppings, providing a natural safe harbor for early Lake Superior explorers.

The area is home to several nonprofit educational institutions, such as the Grand Marais Art Colony and the North House Folk School, and art galleries featuring the work of local and regional artists.

On April 13, 2020, a large fire swept through downtown Grand Marais, destroying three buildings: The Crooked Spoon Cafe, White Pine North, and Picnic and Pine. The fire burned for over three hours in intense winds.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , all land. Grand Marais is on the northwestern shore of Lake Superior. It is an entry point for the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, at the beginning of the Gunflint Trail. The Superior Hiking Trail passes near Grand Marais, and Judge C. R. Magney State Park is nearby.

The land surrounding Grand Marais slopes up to form the Sawtooth Bluff, a dramatic rock face visible from nearly any vantage point in the city. Adjacent to the bluff is Pincushion Mountain, a large bald monolith with views of Lake Superior and the inland wilderness.

Grand Marais Harbor is protected by Artist&#x27;s Point, a barrier island formed by lava that was connected to the mainland by gravel deposited by lake currents, forming a tombolo. An Arctic–alpine disjunct community survives there.

Road access to Grand Marais is by Minnesota Highway 61, which follows the shore of Lake Superior, and is known as the North Shore Scenic Drive. The Gunflint Trail (Cook County Road 12) begins in Grand Marais and heads northwest, away from the lake and into the Boundary Waters region.

Grand Marais is northeast of Duluth and southwest of the Canada–US border.

Grand Marais hosts numerous festivals. They celebrate the history and culture of the North Shore and the city itself.
* Fisherman&#x27;s Picnic is held in Grand Marais during the first weekend in August.

The tradition continues with the Lions Club&#x27;s Famous Fishburger Stand. Herring, still provided by local commercial fishermen, is dipped in coating, fried golden brown and served piping hot on a hot dog bun. Each year, Fisherman&#x27;s Picnic features fireworks over the harbor, contests, and a parade.
* Moose Madness is held the third weekend in October. It celebrates the area&#x27;s moose population, and is a family-themed event with games, prizes, and activities.

<doc id="119828" wikidata="Q2228498" url="?curid=119828" title="Mountain Lake, Minnesota">
<text>Mountain Lake is a city in Cottonwood County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 2,104 at the 2010 census.

Mountain Lake was initially composed mostly of the 1,800 Low German (or more specifically, Plautdietsch) speaking Mennonites from Russia who settled there between 1873 and 1880. Although the city has gradually become more diverse, with the more recent addition of immigrant groups including Lao, Hmong, and Hispanic people, a significant percentage of its inhabitants still have Mennonite surnames.

==History==
The city of Mountain Lake was formally platted on May 25, 1872. It has had a post office in operation since 1871.

===Original settlement===
The name &quot;Mountain Lake&quot; is usually attributed to early settler William Mason. The city&#x27;s official website recalls, &quot;the first white settler to the area, William Mason, found a shallow 900-acre lake with three islands. The two smaller islands just broke the water&#x27;s surface. The third much larger, higher island looked to Mason like a mountain rising from the lake. He named the lake Mountain Lake and the island Mountain Island.&quot; The top of the island was covered with trees, and could be seen for miles around, thus serving as a landmark to early settlers. The story continues that in 1871 the St. Paul &amp; Sioux City Railway had selected &quot;Midway&quot; as the name of the village, since it was located midway between Saint Paul, Minnesota and Sioux City, Iowa. However, Mason insisted that the village being platted be named &quot;Mountain Lake&quot;.

Demand for more tillable farmland and construction advances led to the draining of the original lake in 1905–1906, which was located in Mountain Lake township, southeast of town. However, in 1937–1938 a dam, bridge, and outlet were constructed by the Works Progress Administration at a new site in Midway township to create a new Mountain Lake. This lake, located on the north edge of town, also has an island.

The large island of the original lake – now just a hill amidst the surrounding cornfields – became a county park which has since 1973 been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Archeological evidence suggests that early settler William Mason was not the first to appreciate the unique qualities of the original lake&#x27;s island. Artifacts unearthed in a 1976 dig indicated evidence of habitation as early as 500 BC, thus making the location the oldest human habitation yet to be discovered in the state of Minnesota.

===Mennonite immigration and influence===
The coming of the railroad in 1873 played a big role in the expansion of the village. By the time Mountain Lake was formally incorporated in 1886, it had a population of three hundred people, primarily composed of Mennonites immigrating from southern Russia (present-day Ukraine).

In 1873, Mennonite immigrants from Ukraine (at that time, Ukraine was part of the Russian Empire) began to arrive in Mountain Lake, having been recruited by William Seeger, a member of the Minnesota State Board of Immigration. Seeger had specifically targeted Mennonites, “because they were believed to be hard workers of good character.” The majority of these Mennonite families came from the Molotschna Colony, located near the present-day city of Melitopol, Ukraine. However, a number of Manitoba Mennonites originally from the Chortitza Colony, near the present-day Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia, also settled in the Mountain Lake area. By 1880, it is estimated that some 295 Mennonite families had settled there.

Because Mountain Lake was already an established community and its surrounding farmland largely surveyed, the Mennonites could not arrange themselves in the traditional communal villages they had been accustomed to in their Ukrainian colonies. This forced them to adapt to American-style, single family farms and to live amongst their non-Mennonite neighbors. As settlement continued, the Mennonites of Mountain Lake had soon established a successful and cohesive community, “based primarily on agriculture and local commerce.” For many decades thereafter, they retained the speaking of Plautdietsch, the Mennonite variation of Low German.

On October 14, 1889, the &quot;Konference der Vereinigten Mennoniten-Brueder von Nord America&quot; was founded in Mountain Lake. Elder Aaron Wall, founder of the Bruderthaler Church of Mountain Lake and Elder Isaac Peters of the Ebenezer Church of Henderson, Nebraska were instrumental in the establishment of this new Mennonite denomination. Known today as the &quot;Fellowship of Evangelical Bible Churches&quot; (FEBC), for many years the conference was popularly called the Bruderthaler Conference, because of the influential nature of the Mountain Lake founding church. In 1914 the name was officially changed to &quot;The Defenceless Mennonite Brethren in Christ of North America&quot;. The name was changed once again, in 1937, to &quot;Evangelical Mennonite Brethren&quot; (EMB). The denominational headquarters was located in Mountain Lake until 1956.

Around the year 1905, several local men founded the Mennonite hospital of Mountain Lake. The institution struggled until 1912, when it was sold and reorganized as the Bethel Deaconess Hospital. The physicians in charge were Dr. Piper of Mountain Lake and Dr. Sogge of Windom, who were assisted by three deaconess sisters. The hospital was managed by a local board of directors consisting of one member from each of the town&#x27;s five Mennonite churches.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Minnesota State Highway 60 serves as a main route around the city, running generally east to west. Secondarily, County Road 1 runs north and south through town.

<text>Mountain Lake Township is a township located in Cottonwood County, Minnesota, United States. According to the 2010 census, the population was 384. The township was organized in 1871.

==Geography==
Mountain Lake Township has a total area of , of which is land and , or 0.17%, is water.

It derives its name from the (now drained) lake of the same name which existed within its borders. Otherwise, there are several small creeks flowing in the township. Except for the extreme southern portion of the town of Mountain Lake, which is primarily located in Midway Township, there are no incorporated towns within the township. An early historical source describes the land within its borders thus, &quot;It is excellent land and produces immense crops of all grains and grasses common to this latitude.&quot;

==History==
Mountain Lake Township was formally organized on May 6, 1871, at a meeting in the home of A. A. Soule (the village of the same name, which encompasses a small part of its northern boundary, was platted on May 25, 1872). It is a full thirty-six section township, located directly south of Midway Township, west of the Watonwan County line, north of Jackson County, and directly east of Lakeview township.

=== Early history ===
The name &quot;Mountain Lake&quot; itself is attributed to the township&#x27;s earliest non-native inhabitant, William Mason. As told on the city&#x27;s (of the same name) website, “the first white settler to the area, William Mason, found a shallow 900-acre lake with three islands. The two smaller islands just broke the water&#x27;s surface. The third much larger, higher island looked to Mason like a mountain rising from the lake. He named the lake Mountain Lake and the island Mountain Island.” The almost circular island, located in the center of the lake, was flat on top and rose about forty feet out of the water. The top of the island was covered with trees which could be seen for many miles, thus serving as a land-mark and a guide for early settlers. The township was named from the lake which contained the prominent island.

Demand for tillable farmland and construction advances led to the lake&#x27;s draining in the 1905–06 timeframe. The original lake&#x27;s largest island – now a tree-covered hill amidst the surrounding farmland – has become a county park, which since 1973 been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Archeological evidence unearthed in a 1976 dig revealed remnants of a Meskwaki inhabitation from what could be as early as 500 B.C., making the former island&#x27;s location within the township the oldest human habitation yet to be discovered in the state of Minnesota.

=== Formation ===
On May 6, 1871, Daniel D. Bates and others presented a petition at the organizational board meeting held in the home of A. A. Soule, requesting that &quot;township 105, range 34 be set off and called Mountain Lake township.&quot; At the organizational meeting, the aforementioned Daniel D. Bates and A. A. Soule, plus M. Jacobson were appointed election judges and S. H. Soule was appointed clerk. The legal description of the newly formed townships was: &quot;Commencing at the northeast corner of township 105, range 34, thence south to the southeast corner of said township and range; thence west to the southwest corner of said township, thence east to the northeast corner of said township and to the northeast corner of said township, thence to the place of beginning.&quot;

=== Mennonite settlement ===
Mennonite immigrants from Ukraine (at the time, Ukraine was part of Russia) began to arrive in the Mountain Lake area in 1873, having been recruited by William Seeger, a member of the Minnesota State Board of Immigration. Seeger had intentionally targeted these Mennonite farmers, “because they were believed to be hard workers of good character.” 

Because the township&#x27;s farmland was already surveyed, the Mennonites could not arrange themselves in the traditional communal villages they had been accustomed to in their Ukrainian colonies. This forced them to adapt to American-style, single family farms and to live amongst their non-Mennonite neighbors. As settlement continued, however, they soon established a successful and cohesive farming community, “based primarily on agriculture and local commerce.” Many of the township&#x27;s current residents are descendants of these immigrants.

The township contains a historic cemetery dating to circa 1880, located in section 22 of the township, where some of the pioneer Mennonite residents are buried. The population of the township in 1895 was 612 and the 1900 census counted 512 inhabitants.

=== Hutterite settlement ===
In 1994, the Neuhof Hutterite Colony in Mountain Lake township was founded as a division of the Spring Lake Hutterite Colony of Oldham, South Dakota. The Neuhof Colony reports 64 residents. Neuhof is associated with the Hutterite branch known as Schmiedeleut.

In 2005, a second Hutterite colony was formed as a branch of the Upland Hutterite Colony of Letcher, South Dakota, called Elmendorf Christian Community. This community is an independent colony, with a Hutterite tradition. Elmendorf reports 135 residents. Elmendorf is affiliated with a group of independent Hutterites known as the Hutterite Christian Communities.

==Demographics==
According to the U.S. Census, as of 2010 the township&#x27;s population was 384, down from 442 in the 2000 census, making the population density 10.73 persons per square mile (4.8/km).

Hispanic or Latino of any race were reported as 5.5% of the population.

Of the 100 households in the township, 19% were non-family households and 81% were families. There were 40 households which had children under the age of 18. 77% of the family households were husband-wife/married families, 2% were male householders with no wife present, and 2% were female householders with no husband present. Of the non-family households, 17 were householders living alone. The average household size was 3.84 and the average family size was 4.21.

<text>Baxter is a city in Crow Wing County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 8,612 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Brainerd Micropolitan Statistical Area.

Minnesota State Highways 210 and 371 are two of the main routes in the city.

==Geography==
Baxter is just north of Minnesota&#x27;s geographical center, in a terminal moraine area created by the Superior Lobe of the Labradorian ice sheet. The city is home to numerous lakes and ponds.

Baxter is bordered on the west by Cass County and on the east by Brainerd. The Mississippi River marks the southern border but expansion both north and south is possible.

Along with the rest of Crow Wing County and parts of the adjoining counties, Baxter is part of the Brainerd Lakes Area.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water.

==History==
Baxter owes its existence partly to the 1920s operation of a (since closed) large tie-treating plant, owned by Northern Pacific Railroad. Farming was also an important early industry.

Baxter was incorporated on May 25, 1939. The town is named after Luther Baxter, an attorney for the railroad who served in the Minnesota Legislature and as a colonel in the Civil War.

Tourism and various service industries have become Baxter&#x27;s biggest employers, and numerous housing subdivisions have been developed in the wooded area west of Minnesota Highway 371, which passes through the town. Owing to the amount of unused land in the area, commercial development along the highway itself has also increased in recent years, though it has tended to conform to the pattern of urban sprawl.

==Superfund site and environmental damage==
The Burlington Northern (Brainerd/Baxter) United States Environmental Protection Agency Superfund site is on the boundary between Brainerd and Baxter. The site served as a Burlington Northern Railroad tie treatment plant 1907 and 1985. During that time, wastewater generated from the wood-treating process was sent to two shallow, unlined ponds. This created a sludge that contaminated both the underlying soils and the groundwater with creosote and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).

Brainerd was first seen by European settlers on Christmas Day in 1805, when Zebulon Pike stopped there while searching for the headwaters of the Mississippi River. Crow Wing Village, a fur and logging community near Fort Ripley, brought settlers to the area in the mid-19th century.

In those early years, the relationship between the settlers and the Native Americans was fraught. The most famous example of this tenuous relationship was the &quot;Blueberry War&quot; of 1872. Two Ojibwe were hanged for allegedly murdering a missing girl. When a group of Ojibwe approached the town, troops from Fort Ripley were called to prevent a potential reprisal. As it turned out, the Ojibwe only wanted to sell blueberries and the settlers avoided a bloody misunderstanding. The guilt of the two Ojibwe was never proven.

Brainerd was the idea of Northern Pacific railroad president John Gregory Smith, who in 1870 named the township after his wife, Anne Eliza Brainerd Smith, and father-in-law, Lawrence Brainerd. The company built a bridge over the Mississippi seven miles north of Crow Wing Village and used the Brainerd station as a machine and car shop, prompting many to move north and abandon Crow Wing. Brainerd was organized as a city on March 6, 1873.

On January 11, 1876, the state legislature revoked Brainerd&#x27;s charter for six years, in reaction to the election of local handyman Thomas Lanihan as mayor instead of Judge C.B. Sleeper. Brainerd functioned as a township in the interim.

In 1881, the railroad, and with it the town, expanded. Lumber and paper, as well as agriculture in general, were important early industries, but for many decades Brainerd remained a railroad town: in the 1920s roughly 90% of Brainerd residents were dependent on the railroad. Participation in the nationwide railroad strike on July 1, 1922, left most Brainerd residents unemployed and embittered many of those involved.

On October 27, 1933, the First National Bank of Brainerd became briefly famous when it was held up by Baby Face Nelson and his gang.

Over the years, increased efficiency and the better positioning of the more centralized Livingston, Montana, shops led to a decline in the importance of a railroad station that once employed over 1,000 and serviced locomotives for the whole Northern Pacific line. The BNSF Railway (successor to the Northern Pacific) continues to employ approximately 70 people in Brainerd at a maintenance-of-way equipment shop that repairs and maintains track and equipment. The former Northern Pacific railway station has been converted to breweries, coffee shops, and event centers available to rent for special occasions.

The Northwest Paper Company built Brainerd&#x27;s first paper mill in 1903 and with the steady increase in tourism since the early 20th century the paper and service industries have become Brainerd&#x27;s primary employers. The town&#x27;s coating mill was sold by Potlatch to Missota Paper in 2003 and then by Missota Paper to Wausau Paper in 2004. It is now used as a small industrial center called Brainerd Industrial Center (BIC).

Due to the many lakes in the area, Brainerd is a popular summertime destination for those owning cabins in the area, better known as the Brainerd Lakes. Brainerd itself is now heavily developed into commercial and residential areas and has seen an uptick in development in recent years.

==Geography==
Brainerd is just north of Minnesota&#x27;s geographical center, in a relatively hilly terminal moraine area created by the Superior Lobe of the Labradorian ice sheet. The town occupies land on both sides of the Mississippi River, though its older parts are almost all to the east.

Though the city itself has relatively few lakes, there are over 460 lakes within of Brainerd, mostly to the north. For this reason, Crow Wing County and parts of the adjoining counties are often collectively called the Brainerd Lakes Area despite most of the lakes existing closer to Nisswa.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water.

Brainerd has been assigned ZIP code 56401 by the USPS.

===Climate===
Brainerd has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) with vast seasonal differences. Summers are warm, and occasionally hot, with high humidity, whereas winters are often severely cold.

===Superfund site and environmental damage===
The Burlington Northern (Brainerd/Baxter) United States Environmental Protection Agency Superfund site is on the boundary between Brainerd and Baxter. The site served as a Burlington Northern Railroad tie treatment plant from 1907 to 1985. During that time, wastewater generated from the wood-treating process was sent to two shallow, unlined ponds. This created a toxic sludge that contaminated both the underlying soils and the groundwater with creosote and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).

Crosby was built for the sole purpose of mining. It was named for George H. Crosby, a businessman in the mining industry.

Crosby was the location of Minnesota&#x27;s worst mining disaster, the Milford Mine disaster. On February 5, 1924, a new tunnel was blasted too close to nearby Foley Lake, and water rushed in, killing 41 miners.

In the 1932 local elections, Karl Emil Nygard was elected president of Crosby&#x27;s Village Council, making it the first city in the United States to have a Communist mayor.

In August 1957, David G. Simons, a 35-year-old Air Force major, climbed to nearly above the earth as part of Project Manhigh. The flight, which was launched from Crosby&#x27;s Portsmouth Mine Pit Lake, helped the United States take its fledgling steps into space exploration. Simons returned to Crosby in 2007 to mark the 50th anniversary of the project.

<doc id="119874" wikidata="Q602904" url="?curid=119874" title="Pequot Lakes, Minnesota">
<text>Pequot Lakes ( ) is a city in Crow Wing County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 2,395 at the 2020 Census . It is part of the Brainerd micropolitan area.

==History==

Pequot Lakes was platted in March 1900. It was named by a postal official for the first Indian-sounding name he thought of, which is the name of a former tribe of Algonquian Indians in eastern Connecticut. A post office was established at Pequot Lakes in 1896.

According to the Pequot Lakes Heritage Preservation Commission, the city once called Sibley and Frogtown was renamed as Pequot. In 1900, Walter and Flora Brown filed their plat for the E 1/2 of the SW 1/4 section 10 in T136N-R29W under the title Pequot. The Pequot Indians are a tribe that used to dominate southeastern New England before the English colonists arrived. While no Pequot tribe members lived in Minnesota, they spoke an Algonquian language related to that of the local Chippewa (Ojibwe) tribes. Author Herman Melville named his lead ship in his novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; as the &quot;Pequod&quot;.

Two possible explanations for the town&#x27;s name arise:

1. The local historian Carl Zapffe suggests that a variation of the Chippewa word for arrow (&quot;bikwas&quot;), as listed by Father Barroga in his Chippewa dictionary, gave rise to the word Pequot.

2. In a 1936 interview, Laurence Anderson, who moved to the town in the mid-1890s, gave the following explanation. &quot;A daughter of &#x27;Waubanaquot,&#x27; Chief of the White Earth tribe, was named &#x27;O-Pequot&#x27; and lived north of the town on the north end of Sibley Lake. She graciously allowed her dugout home to be used as a school and a church for the early settlers of the town. When she died, she was buried in the town cemetery.&quot;

Because there was already a town named Sibley in southwest Minnesota, the U.S. Post Office said the second Sibley had to take a new name. In any event, the town officially became Pequot Lakes in 1902. 

On June 4, 2002, the former Sibley Township was absorbed into the City of Pequot Lakes.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Pequot Lakes is part of the Brainerd Lakes Area.

Most of the current area of Pequot Lakes was gained through an annexation of the entirety of the surrounding former Sibley Township on June 4, 2002.

<text>Apple Valley is a city in northwestern Dakota County in the State of Minnesota, and a suburb of the Twin Cities. The population was 56,374 at the 2020 census, making it the 17th most populous city in Minnesota.

==History==
The area that became Apple Valley was first established in 1859 as Lebanon Township, and remained a farming community for nearly a century. In the mid-1950s, residential developments started replacing farmland. Orrin Thompson, a real estate developer, was responsible for the city&#x27;s early development. He contracted a company to determine where the next growth in the Twin Cities would be. It was from County Road 42 and Cedar Avenue. Thompson bought the first houses and streets from the Brobacks, who built the city&#x27;s first four houses. The firm that selected this area was in Apple Valley, California, so Thompson took that name for the development. An alternate explanation for the name change exists, however. According to local developer Henry Broback, Lebanon Township was renamed Apple Valley because &quot;...when you drive east on (County Road) 42 and turn to enter Lebanon, it reminded them of Apple Valley, California, which was a nice community.&quot;

Voters in the township voted to incorporate in the 1968 general election. They also selected the name Apple Valley over the name Lebanon Valley by a vote of 1376 to 757.

There were 16,344 households, out of which 42.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 63.7% were married couples living together, 9.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 24.1% were non-families. Of all households, 19.3% were made up of individuals, and 4.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.77 and the average family size was 3.21.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 29.7% under the age of 18, 7.2% from 18 to 24, 33.1% from 25 to 44, 24.4% from 45 to 64, and 5.5% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 95.6 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 92.4 males. For several years, the city&#x27;s population was among the fastest growing in Minnesota, but it has virtually exhausted the amount of additional buildable land within city limits, and so its growth has slowed considerably since 1990.

The median income for a household in the city was $69,752, and the median income for a family was $79,335 (these figures had risen to $76,789 and $86,874 respectively as of a 2007 estimate). Males had a median income of $50,636 versus $33,315 for females. The per capita income for the city was $29,477. About 1.1% of families and 2.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 2.0% of those under age 18 and 3.8% of those age 65 or over.
