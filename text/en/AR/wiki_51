==History==

European Americans settled in the Owatonna area in 1853 around the Straight River. The community was named after the Straight River, which in the Dakota language is &quot;Wakpá Owóthaŋna&quot;. A popular, but apocryphal, story is that the town is named after &quot;Princess Owatonna&quot;, the daughter of local Native American Chief Wabena who was supposedly healed by a nearby spring&#x27;s magic waters, which were said to be rich in iron and sulfur. The earliest the Owatonna area was settled was in 1854. It was platted in September 1855, incorporated as a town on August 9, 1858, and as a city on February 23, 1865.

In 1856, Josef Karel Kaplan emigrated from the village of Dlouhá Třebová, southeast of Prague, Bohemia (now the Czech Republic), and selected a quarter section [] of land near the town of Owatonna. Kaplan described Owatonna as having just 50 small homes, but predicted 100 within a year, along with a railroad. With just four stores and a pharmacy, Owatonna quickly prospered and grew to 1,500 inhabitants in five years. Kaplan wrote about the Owatonna area in letters donated to the Minnesota Historical Society. In them, he described often seeing the indigenous people with &quot;tough constitutions...brown skin and good dispositions&quot;, adding: &quot;When you read about battles between whites and Indians, it is the whites who are to blame.&quot; In 1866, Kaplan helped organize the Catholic cemetery, and a year later, the Bohemian National Cemetery of Owatonna.

Kaplan&#x27;s Woods is part of the land originally owned by Josef Kaplan, and later Victor and Anna Kaplan. The State of Minnesota created Kaplan&#x27;s Wood State Park, which was later transferred to the City of Owatonna. The Kaplan&#x27;s Woods Parkway contains over of hiking and cross country skiing trails, and nearly of hard-surfaced, handicapped-accessible trail. The parkway includes Lake Kohlmier, a lake.

The Minnesota State Public School for Dependent and Neglected Children was built in 1886. The school took in orphans from around the state and taught them &quot;the value of drill, discipline, and labor.&quot; The children who died in the institution were interred in the Children&#x27;s Cemetery behind the school. In 1945, the orphanage closed and in 1947 the State Public School was officially abolished and all its lands, buildings, property, and funds were transferred to the newly established Owatonna State School, which provided academic and vocational training for the developmentally disabled. The Owatonna State School was closed June 30, 1970. In 1974, the City purchased the compound for its office space. Renamed &quot;West Hills,&quot; it continues to serve as the City&#x27;s administration complex and home to many nonprofit civic organizations including a senior activity center, the Owatonna Arts Center, two nonprofit daycare centers, a chemical dependency halfway house, and Big Brothers/Big Sisters, among others.

In July 2008, a Raytheon Hawker 800 corporate jet crashed near Owatonna, resulting in eight deaths.

On November 3, 2015, the Owatonna Public School District passed a bond referendum to fund school facilities improvements focusing on deferred maintenance, safety, and Elementary school crowding. As a result, the school district received $77.9 million to repair all buildings, replace out-of-date equipment, update security in all seven public school buildings, switch the use for two school buildings, and reconfigure grades from K-5, 6, 7-8, 9-12 to K-5, 6-8, 9-12. All facility changes and projects were completed by September 2018.

On November 5, 2019, Owatonna voters approved a referendum, allowing the school district 104 million dollars in bond authority to build a new Owatonna High School. A smaller bond was also approved for the redevelopment of the old OHS site. The new high school, a 317,000 square foot building, located in south eastern Owatonna, broke ground on May 6, 2021, and opened to students on September 5, 2023. A public grand opening ceremony was held on September 23, 2023.

The Steele County Historical Society &quot;preserves Steele County&#x27;s past, shares the county&#x27;s stories, and connects people with history in meaningful ways, for today and for tomorrow.&quot; Established in 1949 to preserve the history of Steele County, it has become one of the largest and most prestigious historical societies in the state. In 1962, the Society permanently leased part of the southeast section of the fairgrounds to begin a pioneer village, the Village of Yesteryear, which has grown in the years since through the additional move of historic structures, as well as museum buildings built on site.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of ; is land and is water. The oldest part of the city (including the downtown area) is on a low-lying area on the eastern bank of the Straight River, extending towards the south from Maple Creek. The city has grown in all directions, and now lies on both sides of the river, as well as above the ridge north of Maple Creek. Significant growth in recent years has occurred to the northeast, where homes have been built along the ravine of Maple Creek as well as alongside Brooktree Golf Course, to the north, and to the southeast. Geographical landmarks of note include Kaplan&#x27;s Woods, a hardwood nature preserve on the southern border of the city; Cinder Hill, a steep 60-foot hill on Linn Avenue overlooking downtown that local athletes use for training; the Straight River dam, originally used to power a mill and now reconstructed to include a fish ladder; and the Forest Hill Cemetery, an old wooded cemetery on the ridge north of Maple Creek that marks the boundary between the oldest parts of the city and more recent developments.

Record rainfall events from September 22 to 24, 2010, caused flooding of the Straight River and Maple Creek in and near Owatonna, with developments in the floodplains of both streams completely inundated.

<doc id="121885" wikidata="Q1924160" url="?curid=121885" title="Morris, Minnesota">
<text>Morris is a city and the county seat of Stevens County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 5,105 at the 2020 census.

Morris is surrounded by some of the nation&#x27;s richest agricultural land, and agribusiness is important to the local economy. Headquartered in Morris, Riverview LLP is Minnesota&#x27;s largest dairy milking operation and one of the largest in the nation. Other large economic contributors are beef feedlots and swine producers, manufacturing, education, and healthcare industries.

The town is home to the University of Minnesota Morris (UMM), part of the University of Minnesota system. It was established as a public college in 1960 on the grounds of a former industrial school for Native Americans. Today the campus has a population of approximately 1,900 and is ranked as a &quot;Top 10 Public Liberal Arts College&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; and one of &quot;America&#x27;s Top Colleges&quot; by &quot;Forbes.&quot;

==History==
Morris was platted in 1869 and named for Charles F. Morris (1827–1903), a railroad engineer. A post office has been in operation at Morris since 1871, when Morris township was organized. It was incorporated as a village in 1878 and as a city in 1902.

The federal government and state in the 19th century had programs to assimilate Native Americans to the majority culture. The Sisters of Mercy Roman Catholic order, led by Mary Joseph Lynch, established a boarding school for Indians in Morris, operating it from 1887 to 1896 under contract to the federal government. Initially, most students came from the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians, which had many Catholic converts. The Morris Industrial School for Indians was to prepare students for jobs in the industrializing culture.

The federal government then appointed staff to manage the school into the early 20th century, before transferring it to the state. After the state took over the school in the early 20th century for general education, it taught agricultural topics. Agriculture has continued to be a major part of the economy. In 1909 the University of Minnesota established the West Central School of Agriculture (WCSA), and Morris closed.

When the state announced a phase-out plan for Morris and similar agricultural schools, a grassroots citizens&#x27; movement convinced the state to establish a public college on the Morris campus. In the fall of 1960, the University of Minnesota Morris opened to students seeking a liberal arts education. It has been ranked a &quot;Top 10 Public Liberal Arts College&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; and one of &quot;America&#x27;s Top Colleges&quot; by &quot;Forbes.&quot;

The city contains five properties listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the 1881 Lewis H. Stanton House, the 1899 Morris Industrial School for Indians Dormitory, the 1905 Morris Carnegie Library, and the early-20th-century West Central School of Agriculture and Experiment Station Historic District. Morris High School, begun in 1914, is also listed, even though it was demolished in 2013.

The 1975 Morris earthquake occurred on July 9, and was the state&#x27;s largest 20th-century earthquake, rated at 4.6 Mn. On June 4, 1993, another quake slightly shook the community. This one measured 4.1 in magnitude and was the third-largest earthquake in Minnesota in the 20th century.

Manufacturer Superior Industries employs about 800 people at its two plants in town. A majority of Superior&#x27;s workforce is skilled in engineering or fabrication. The company manufactures steel conveyors and storage tanks for industries handling dry bulk, fuels and gases. In 2008, &quot;Inc.&quot; magazine ranked Superior Industries as one of the fastest-growing private companies in the United States.

==Higher education==
The University of Minnesota Morris (UMM) is one of five campuses in the University of Minnesota system. It was established as a public college in 1960, on the grounds of the Morris Industrial School for Indians, which had also operated as an agricultural school. UMM has an enrollment of about 1,900 students and 145 teaching faculty. Some 61 students made up the first graduating class in 1961. Since then, Morris has conferred more than 10,000 degrees.

Morris is home to the West Central Research and Outreach Center, a division of the greater University of Minnesota&#x27;s College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences. WCROC&#x27;s faculty and staff study agronomy, soil science, livestock, horticulture, renewable energy and swine production.

WCROC is home to the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Horticulture Gardens. During the last decade, the privately funded research gardens have gained increasing popularity. Their design has increased in aesthetic appeal while maintaining a research base. Each summer, the gardens are host to thousands of visitors.

==Prairie Pioneer Days==
Prairie Pioneer Days is a family festival hosted by the Morris Area Chamber of Commerce every July, which celebrates European-American settlement in the area. It includes many activities around town, including a parade, fireworks, and food and craft vendors. Since the late 20th century, festival organizers have also worked to include Native American participants and acknowledge contributions by their cultures.

==Stevens County Fair==
The Stevens County Fair takes place in Morris on the second full weekend in August. It is known for entertainment, 4-H events and family time. Each year people from miles around come to see the exhibits, take in some entertainment in the grandstand and see old friends while sitting on one of many benches in the shade.

In June 2020, a neo-pagan religion known as the Asatru Folk Assembly (AFA) purchased the Calvary Lutheran Church, a former Lutheran church in Murdock for use as a gathering place for AFA members of the Northern Great Plains.
On December 9, 2020, the Murdock City Council voted to allow the AFA conditional approval to use the former church. This caused uproar as the AFA has a policy of only allowing whites to become members of the religion, leading to accusations of racism against the AFA and against Murdock.

<text>Browerville is a city in Todd County, Minnesota. The population was 790 at the time of the 2010 census. By the 2020 Decennial Census the population had increased to 839.

==History==
Browerville was platted in 1882, and named after Jacob V. Brower (1844–1905), a noted conservationist, father of both Itasca State Park and the Minnesota State Park system, and former Todd County official. Browerville was incorporated in 1884. Two properties in town are on the National Register of Historic Places: the Kahlert Mercantile Store, built in 1883, and the Church of St. Joseph, completed in 1909.

Despite being a largely Irish-, German- and Polish-American area of the State, a Rusyn farming community was also formed during the early 20th century in Browerville, by recent immigrants who had migrated West from the industrial cities in Pennsylvania. The building of a Byzantine Catholic parish church was preceded by the founding of a chapter of the Greek Catholic Union of the USA.

In a 21 August 1912 open letter to the &quot;Amerikansky Russky Viestnik&quot;, the parishioners of Holy Trinity Greek Catholic Church in Browerville, known locally as &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Church&quot; and which was being served by visiting priests from St John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Church in Minneapolis, announced that they had recently refused to surrender the parish and cemetery deeds to Pope Pius X&#x27;s newly appointed Greek Catholic Bishop of the United States, Kyr Soter Ortynsky. This was because the Byzantine Rite farmers of Browerville were Rusyns from Transcarpathia and members of the Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church, and they accordingly viewed Bishop Soter, a member of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church from the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, as a foreigner. They intended instead to wait for a Rusyn Bishop to also be assigned in North America before surrendering the deed.

A regular pastor was never assigned, however. Tensions rose further in 1926, when the family of Michael Dorosh, inspired by Russophilia, converted to the Russian Orthodox Church and joined St. Mary&#x27;s Russian Orthodox Church in Holdingford, Minnesota. For a time, the Russian Orthodox priest from Holdingford would visit Browerville, which led to both Orthodox and Greek Catholics using Holy Trinity Church at different times. Most parishioners of Holy Trinity Church, however, eventually switched to the Roman Rite and mainly joined St. Peter&#x27;s Church, locally known as &quot;the German church&quot;, instead of converting to Orthodoxy.

The last attempted use of the Church was for a Greek Catholic Funeral Liturgy, or Panikhida. The Greek Catholic priest from Northeast Minneapolis drove only as far as St. Cloud, Minnesota before further progress was stopped by the infamous 1940 Armistice Day Blizzard. To the outrage of the remaining Greek Catholics of Browerville, they were still required to pay the priest&#x27;s bill. The Holy Trinity Church building then fell into disuse and has since been demolished.

In 1990, the Traditional Catholic Sisters of the Society of Saint Pius X purchased the former Browerville hospital, which has been in use ever since as their Novitiate.

<text>Eagle Bend is a city in Todd County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 535 at the 2010 census. By the 2020 Census the population had increased slightly to 546.

==History==
Eagle Bend was first settled in the early 1880s. The first pioneers were Charles O&#x27;Dell, a merchant, and Marion Crider, a homesteader from eastern Kentucky. When O&#x27;Dell opened his general store, his first customer was Crider, who bought a pound of coffee. The townsite was purchased by a railroad executive, Benjamin F. Abbott, who wished to change the name of the town to Abbottsville; however, sensibility prevailed and the evocative name of Eagle Bend was retained. The post office was established in O&#x27;Dell&#x27;s store in 1882, and the village was incorporated on January 21, 1890.

In June 1933, Clarence Olson, alias Tuffy, a Prohibition era bootlegger and gangster based in Eagle Bend who, according to &quot;The Long Prairie Leader&quot;, &quot;has long had a reputation as a liquor runner and hijacker and who has been claimed by many to be the toughest man between Minneapolis and Duluth&quot;, met his destiny in a Holdingford area gunfight. After arriving with two associates at the farmhouse of Holdingford bootleggers Joseph and Anthony Dzierweczynski to buy 85 gallons of Minnesota 13 moonshine, Tuffy Olson first announced that the Dzierweczynskis would now be paid in cash. Then, however, Tuffy Olson and his enforcer Harley Buchan drew their sidearms and announced that they intended to take to 85 gallons of moonshine for free. Joseph Dzierweczynski, however, managed to flee the room and returned with a loaded shotgun. As he and Buchan fled back to their escape vehicle, Tuffy Olson received two fatal shotgun blasts in the back. Following an investigation by the Stearns and Todd County Sheriff&#x27;s Departments, Tuffy&#x27;s two surviving enforcers and the Dzierweczynski brothers were both arrested pending criminal charges.

According to the &quot;Long Prairie Leader&quot;, &quot;Tuffy Olson has for years had a reputation of being a booze runner who has had many conflicts with the law. At the time of his death, a Federal charge of illegal possession of liquor was hanging over his head, the trial being scheduled for later in the year. It is alleged that he peddled liquor at dance halls over a wide area and other rumors credit him with having hijacked many liquor runners in this section of the State.&quot;

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The village is located at a bend of Eagle Creek. Eagle Creek drains Harris Creek, and in turn flows into Long Prairie River.

==History==

Long Prairie&#x27;s history dates back to the time when the land was inhabited first by the Sioux/Dakota and then Anishinaabe/ Ojibwe Native American tribes. In an 1846 treaty, the U.S. government gave a vast area in what is now central Minnesota to the Winnebago Indians (Ho-Chunk), known as the Long Prairie Reservation. A site at Long Prairie was chosen as headquarters for the tribe. In 1848, the tribe was resettled from the Neutral Ground in northeast Iowa to the Long Prairie Reservation. The journey North was a difficult and long trip, but once at the Long Prairie Reservation, the tribe built a functioning village with homes, a school, and a church. A subsequent treaty in 1855 again resettled the tribe in southern Minnesota.

Long Prairie was platted in 1867, and named after the Long Prairie River. The river was originally given its name by the Ojibwe/Anishinaabe people. There is a United States Geological Survey stream flow monitoring gauge in the river in Long Prairie.

=== Marshal George Williams ===
In July 1922 Long Prairie Village Marshal George Williams was shot and killed by men fleeing a botched bank robbery in Hewitt. The killing took place at a late night road block near the current municipal liquor store.

The text on William&#x27;s memorial reads as follows: &quot;This monument honors George H. Williams who was village Marshal of Long Prairie. He was awakened by a ringing telephone in the early hours of July 29, 1922. The call was a summons from Todd County Deputy Sheriff Seely Adams. An attempt had been made to rob the Hewitt bank and a roadblock was needed at the bridge over the Long Prairie River. George kissed his wife Kathryn, goodbye. Minutes later, he was shot dead on the railroad tracks near the bridge, just north of this monument.

George Williams was a leader in the community. In addition to being village marshal he served as fire chief and was active in a number of community service organizations.

<text>Mazeppa ( ) is a city in Wabasha County, Minnesota, United States, along the North Fork of the Zumbro River. The population was 874 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Mazeppa was platted in 1855, and named in honor of Hetman Ivan Mazepa via a poem by Lord Byron. The first census was taken in 1860, it showed 534 residents. The town was incorporated in 1877. Mazeppa in its early years was a flour milling center and boasted 7 trains a day at its peak. The line was nicknamed the &quot;Bug Line&quot; due to the crooked nature of the line east of town. The mill during its best years produced 600 barrels of flour a day and had 80 employees. The mill was powered by a turbine from water held back by 26 foot tall wooden dam on the Zumbro River and formed the &quot;Mill Pond&quot; as seen in historical pictures. The mill had its ups and downs until it burned down on Feb 2, 1891, foul play was suspected. The last train left Mazeppa in 1952. Despite valiant efforts at growth and industry, Mazeppa has since moved into the 21st Century as a quiet, well kept farm &amp; bedroom community.

The Mazeppa Public School was built in 1858 and further expanded on many times including a new High School completed in 1958. A fire on December 26, 1975, destroyed the historic elementary school. The newer adjoining high school and 1940s gymnasium were saved from the blaze by the heroic efforts of Mazeppa residents Keith Ramthun &amp; Joseph Liffrig who managed to close the fire doors leading to the high school and gymnasium before the fire department arrived. The Mazeppa Public School system merged with the Zumbrota Public School system in fall of 1987 to create the Zumbrota-Mazeppa Public Schools represented by the mascot the &quot;Cougars&quot;.

==History==

Waseca was platted in July 1867 where the railroad system established a stop. Within a year it was a major shipping hub for wheat, and the city had 129 buildings and 700 people.

In 1912 the University of Minnesota purchased 246 acres of swampland and established an experimental farm called Southeast Station. Studies included corn, swine and cattle-breeding. In 1953 the university opened the Southern School of Agriculture for farming students. It operated as a boarding school, with a six-month term scheduled around farming activities. In 1971 it became the University of Minnesota Waseca, a two-year technical college, and served nearly 20,000 students before closing in 1992.

The city took its name from Waseca County, Minnesota. &quot;Waseca&quot; is a Dakota language word meaning &quot;rich in provisions&quot;. It was founded as a hub of agricultural activity. In the mid-1900s, three companies were founded in Waseca with national markets: Brown Printing, EF Johnson Technologies Inc., and Herter&#x27;s Outgoor Gear. The result was a strong, diverse economy. In the mid-1970s, Waseca&#x27;s post office was the third busiest in the state for postal receipts.

In 1923, Edgar F. Johnson and his wife, Ethel Johnson, founded E.F. Johnson Co. It shared space with a downtown Waseca woodworking shop, and sold radio transmission parts by mail order. It built its first factory in 1936, and was a major supplier of defense production during World War II. Johnson merged with Western Union in 1982. In 1997, it was sold and its headquarters moved to Texas. The Johnsons played a major role in establishing Waseca County Historical Society.

George Herter launched Herter&#x27;s in 1937 from his father&#x27;s dry goods store and became an original model of successful mail-order retailers. Herter&#x27;s merchandise is now sold by Cabela&#x27;s and Bass Pro Shops. Herter&#x27;s successful catalog business, including its print runs of 400,000 to 500,000 copies, were a major factor in Brown Printing&#x27;s success. Brown Printing was started in 1949 and grew to include facilities in Illinois and Pennsylvania. It was sold to Quad Printing in 2015.

A post office has been in operation at Waseca since 1867. Waseca was incorporated as a city in 1881.

During the Second World War, the E.F. Johnson Company plant was on war footing, with production 24 hours a day and heavy surveillance. Waseca was one of the first cities to use municipal funds to buy war bonds.
On April 30, 1967, Waseca was severely damaged by the 1967 Iowa–Minnesota tornado outbreak.
Waseca has six properties on the National Register of Historic Places: the 1868 Philo C. Bailey House, the circa-1895 William R. Wolf House, the 1896 Roscoe P. Ward House, the 1897 John W.

<text>Bayport is a city in Washington County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 4,024 at the 2020 census.

Bayport is located along the St. Croix River, one mile south of Stillwater.

==History==
The City of Bayport began as three small settlements along the St. Croix River. In 1873, the St. Croix Railway Improvement Company combined the three settlements into South Stillwater, which was incorporated as a village in 1881. Because many people confused South Stillwater with the city of Stillwater, the city changed its name to Bayport in 1922.

Like its northern neighbor Stillwater, the early economy of Bayport centered around the lumber industry. From 1852 to 1916, several sawmills operated within the City. The Andersen Corporation is the successor to Bayport&#x27;s early lumbering firms. The Andersen Corporation (then the Andersen Lumber Company) moved to Bayport in 1913, among other reasons, to take advantage of the city&#x27;s rail lines first built in 1872. The Andersen Corporation prospered in Bayport, becoming the largest window and patio door manufacturer in the world.

In 1914, the Minnesota Correctional Facility - Stillwater moved from Stillwater to Bayport. Experts at the time considered the prison to be one of the most modern penal institutions in the world. As of 2010, the prison housed about 1600 inmates, who are counted as Bayport residents for census purposes. The maximum security Minnesota Correctional Facility - Oak Park Heights opened just beyond Bayport&#x27;s western boundary in 1982.

Due to its location on the St. Croix River, Bayport has long been associated with boating. The Bayport Boat Yard, located just south of the Andersen Corporation, built several well-known steamboats. Barge construction and repairs continued at the boatyard through World War Two. Today, the city is home to the Bayport Marina, and many boaters gain access to the St. Croix River at one of Bayport&#x27;s public boat launches.

<text>Birchwood Village is a city in Washington County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 863 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Cedar Street / Hall Avenue serves as a main route. The village is on the south and east shore of White Bear Lake.

==History==

Birchwood first developed as a community of summer recreation cottages built by residents of the Saint Paul area in early 20th-century. Initial subdivisions were along the lakeshore, and this area is now characterized by a potpourri of old homes that have been extensively remodeled, and new homes where the original structure has been demolished. The newer subdivisions away from the lake have larger lots and are more homogeneous in appearance but have retained the flavor of the village by preserving the natural features of the area.

The community was at one time served by the Twin City Lines street car which passed through the village on its way from Saint Paul to White Bear Lake and Mahtomedi. The significant difference in lot sizes between the older and newer areas of the community reflect the influence of changes in transportation modes.

First incorporated as a village in the year 1921, a subsequent act of the State Legislature converted the &quot;village&quot; to a &quot;City of the Fourth Class.&quot; Residents felt, however, that the term &quot;village&quot; was so much a part of the community that it was amended to &quot;Birchwood Village, a City of the Fourth Class.&quot;

<doc id="122048" wikidata="Q1913788" url="?curid=122048" title="Hugo, Minnesota">
<text>Hugo ( ) is a city north of downtown Saint Paul in Washington County in the U.S. state of Minnesota. The population was 14,767 at the 2020 census. The city lies north of White Bear Lake on the border of the metropolitan boundary. Hugo and nearby suburbs comprise the northeast portion of Minneapolis-St. Paul, the sixteenth largest metropolitan area in the United States.

The city&#x27;s largest lake, Oneka Lake, is named for the Dakota word &quot;onakan,&quot; which means &quot;to strike or knock off,&quot; rice into a canoe. Just south is Rice Lake where Mdewakanton Dakota from Mendota gathered wild rice.

==History==
Originally settled by French Canadians, Hugo early on established itself as a refueling station for the Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad (later the Northern Pacific Railway). Located in Oneka township, the community was first named Centerville Station and finally Hugo. The naming of Hugo is still uncertain. Local histories point to the French novelist, Victor Hugo, as its namesake due to the abundance of French-Canadian settlers in the area and the writer&#x27;s tremendous popularity at the time. Duluth mayor, Trevanion William Hugo, is also said to have given Hugo its name; however, the name &quot;Hugo&quot; was already being used by the village post office before Trevanion Hugo emigrated from Canada. The Oneka Township surrounding the area was also named by the French-Canadians settling the area. Oneka was derived from the Dakota word &quot;onakan&quot; meaning to strike or knock off rice into a canoe. The village incorporated in 1906 and was officially incorporated as a city in 1972. After 2000, Hugo had absorbed significant suburban growth and development to become the thriving city it is today.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of ; is land and is water.

The city is bound by Elmcrest Avenue North on its west, Keystone Avenue North on its east, 180th Street North on its north, and 120th Street North on its south.

==History==

Marine on St. Croix was founded in 1839 as Marine Mills. The city was the site of the first commercial sawmill on the St. Croix River. The sawmill was built by Illinois lumbermen David Hone and Lewis Judd, who saw the opportunity to cut the St. Croix River valley&#x27;s abundant white pine. They named the mill after their hometown of Marine, Illinois. The mill began operation in August 1839, making it the first commercial sawmill within Minnesota. It was first powered by water and then by steam, and it operated through 1895. Over of lumber was milled through this sawmill. Although the frame buildings were demolished and the sawmill equipment was sold, footings of the buildings are still visible. The Marine Mill site is now a historic site operated by the Minnesota Historical Society.

The Village of Marine Mills incorporated in 1950 as the City of Marine on St. Croix. The city retains several historic sites in addition to the Marine Mill, such as the General Store, built in 1870; the Stone House Museum, built in 1872; the Village Hall, built in 1888; the Lutheran Church; and the Fire Hall.

===Marine on St. Croix Historic District===
A historic district in Marine on St. Croix was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 for having state-level significance in the themes of architecture, commerce, exploration/settlement, and industry. It was nominated as the birthplace of Minnesota&#x27;s lumber industry and for its representation of two separate but interdependent waves of immigration that created the town.

The district encompasses three distinct areas: the original business district bounded by Oak, 5th, and Mill Streets; the residential area of the Yankee business owners on the bluffs to the north, now bisected by Highway 95; and the residential areas of the Swedish working class, initially on the low areas to the north and south of the village center, and later on the bluff to the west. 60 buildings and three sites of ruins were identified as the contributing properties to the historic district in 1974.

<text>Scandia is a city in Washington County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 3,984 at the 2020 census. Scandia is 25 miles northeast of Saint Paul, Minnesota.

==History==
As evidenced by the town&#x27;s name, Scandia has a rich Scandinavian heritage. It is the site of what is believed to have been Minnesota&#x27;s first Swedish immigrant settlement. In 1850, the first log cabin was built on the shores of Hay Lake. The first sanctuary of Elim Lutheran Church was built in 1856 on a site near Hay Lake.

After many years as New Scandia Township, Scandia became a city on January 1, 2007, to allay concerns that the community could be annexed by the nearby city of Forest Lake. The city is served by a weekly newspaper, the &quot;Country Messenger&quot;.

==Points of interest==
* Gammelgården of Scandia has preserved, presented, and promoted Swedish immigrant heritage and history since 1972, with events such as &quot;Spelmansstämma&quot;, &quot;Midsommarafton&quot;, and Dalapalooza. The latter is a reference to the Dalecarlian horses the city has erected to welcome visitors.
* Hay Lake School was constructed in 1896. This was rural school district #2, organized in Washington County in 1855. After several years of holding school in local homes, the school was moved into the old Elim Lutheran Church building. The school used that structure, now a part of the Gammelgarden complex, until this brick building was built. The school was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 1, 1970.
* The Erickson Log House Museum centers on the log house constructed in 1868 by Johannes Erickson and his 13-year-old son, Alfred. In 1904, Alfred Erickson constructed a new home and the old log home became at various times a granary, a garage, and a playhouse. In 1974, the Washington County Historical Society purchased the old log house and moved it one and a half miles to its present site. The Erickson Log House was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 17, 1976.
* The Washington County Barn Quilt Trail is a 16.4-mile (26.39-km) route that winds through Scandia, Marine on St. Croix, and the Town of May. Along the way are 18 barn quilts based on patterns in the book &quot;The Quiltmaker&#x27;s Gift&quot;.
