From 1852 to 1857, Olmsted was sent to the southern United States by his employer, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, to study and write about slavery. It was published as &quot;Journeys and Explorations in the Cotton Kingdom&quot;.

Each fall season Sebastopol has Sebastopolooza–a fairly large fall festival. In 2010 Sebastopolooza had over a thousand people.

Sebastopol is centrally located between four larger towns, the towns of Forest, Carthage, Union and Philadelphia. Although the town has a local grocery store, most people drive to one of the larger towns to purchase basic household goods. The nearest theatre is a small local operation located in Philadelphia, Mississippi.

The town got access to cable TV in the late 1990s, which has yet to be offered to areas located just outside the city limits. Most local people wishing to have television must subscribe to satellite programming. This makes accessibility to high-speed internet almost impossible. On October 11, 2010, all cable services from Sky Cablevision, the only cable provider for Sebastopol, were disconnected.

<doc id="122423" wikidata="Q772856" url="?curid=122423" title="Rolling Fork, Mississippi">
<text>Rolling Fork is a city and county seat of Sharkey County, Mississippi, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population of the town was 1,883.

==History==

Thomas Y. Chaney settled here in 1828, and was the first European-American settler in the area. The Choctaw, longtime indigenous occupants, had been forced out by new settler pressure and government treaties to gain their land.

Deer Creek flows through the settlement. Chaney called the place &quot;Rolling Fork&quot; because of the swiftness of the water at a fork in the creek there. A post office was established in 1848.

When Sharkey County was established in 1876, during the Reconstruction era, Rolling Fork was made the county seat. A newspaper, &quot;The Deer Creek Pilot&quot;, was established in 1884.

The Louisville, New Orleans and Texas Railway was built through Rolling Fork in 1883. It was later acquired by the Illinois Central Railroad. In 1908, the Bank of Rolling Fork was established.

Since 2002, the town has hosted an annual October festival called the Great Delta Bear Affair, originally commemorating President Theodore Roosevelt’s bear hunt in 1902 in Sharkey County. During each festival, an artist carves a new wooden statue of a bear which is then added to the town&#x27;s streets.

=== 2023 tornado ===
On March 24, 2023, shortly after 8:00 p.m. CDT, Rolling Fork was struck by a destructive and deadly high–end EF4 tornado with winds of 195 mph. The tornado formed from a supercell thunderstorm in northern Issaquena County, whereupon it moved northeast towards and into Rolling Fork. The National Weather Service issued a tornado emergency for the community shortly before the storm entered the town and dealt catastrophic damage to many structures. The town&#x27;s post office, city hall, and police department lost parts of or the entirety of their roofs. Multiple businesses—some of metal or brick construction—were completely destroyed, in addition to dozens of houses and mobile homes. One of the town&#x27;s water towers was blown over, two grain trucks were thrown into each other, power lines were knocked down, and trees were uprooted, some even debarked. The tornado killed 17 people in Rolling Fork and nearby Midnight and Silver City, while injuring 165 more. Following the tornado, Rolling Fork&#x27;s existing tornado siren was repaired and a new siren was donated and installed on the opposite side of the town.

<doc id="122425" wikidata="Q2425212" url="?curid=122425" title="D'Lo, Mississippi">
<text>D&#x27;Lo is a town in Simpson County, Mississippi, United States, along the Strong River. The population was 373 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Jackson, Mississippi metropolitan area.

The town was featured in &quot;Life&quot; magazine for sending more men per capita to serve in World War II than any other town of its size; 38 percent of the men who lived in D&#x27;Lo served.

In 2016, the town was featured on the UP reality TV series, &quot;Small Town, Big Mayor&quot;.

==History==
The town of D&#x27;Lo was founded by R. W. May on March 1, 1900, when a town plat was registered with the Simpson County Board of Supervisors, March 1, 1900. On August 16, 1901, a village by the name &quot;D&#x27;Lo&quot; was incorporated and boundaries identified by Governor of Mississippi. The village of &quot;D&#x27;Lo&quot; was raised to the rank of &quot;town&quot; on October 27, 1905, by proclamation and signed by the Governor Mississippi.

The name D&#x27;Lo is a modification of the name of the local U.S. Post Office, which was named &quot;Dlo&quot; from 1881 to January 1, 1950. The Post Office was established and approved June 17, 1881, under the name &quot;Dlo&quot;. The first postmaster was May&#x27;s wife, Mary Frances May, and the post office was run from May&#x27;s home until it moved with the establishment of the town. The name &quot;Dlo&quot; was chosen by the contract postal rider on the Brandon-Westville mail route after the initial choice, &quot;Millhaven&quot;, was rejected by the Post Office Department. Just as the Strong River got its name from a translation of a Choctaw word describing the strong taste of the river water – which has a large amount of tannic acid dissolved in it – &quot;Dlo&quot; derives from a French phrase meaning &quot;Bitter Undrinkable Water&quot;, which appears on an early map of the area. The phrase beginning &quot;De l&#x27;eau non potable...&quot; was shortened to &quot;Dlo&quot;, and then &quot;D&#x27;Lo.&quot;

The town expanded in 1916 when the Finkbine Lumber Company chose it as the location for a $1,000,000 sawmill plant. Finkbine constructed many houses in the community for their workers, as well as a combination dry goods, hardware, grocery store, farm supply, feed and seed, and general store known as Kew Mercantile Company. During the peak of the Finkbine&#x27;s sawmill plant operation, between 1916 and 1930, Millhaven was recognized as the largest town between Jackson and Hattiesburg. It had two large YMCA buildings, a movie theater, ten grocery stores, a furniture store, three appliance dealers, ten gas stations, seven butcher&#x27;s markets, a dry cleaner, five cafes, three auto shops, a boat building and cabinet shop, a machine shop, three pharmacies, a bank, lighted basketball courts, professional basketball and baseball teams, and a newspaper called &quot;The D&#x27;Lo Herald&quot;.

The town also had Baptist and Methodist churches, and a three-story brick school with 550 students and 17 teachers. Its three-story Pine View Hospital was considered the best hospital between Jackson and the Mississippi Gulf Coast, as far as equipment and doctors were concerned. During this time the population of Millhaven was estimated to be around 5,000, which made it the second largest milling town in the United States. However, by the 1930s the Finkbine Mill had consumed almost all the timber in the surrounding counties, and the plant was shut down.

With the Finkbine sawmill closed, D&#x27;Lo lost jobs and suffered a major decline in population. It took several years for the town&#x27;s economy to begin to recover. With the construction of U.S. Route 49 through the town, Lumber companies could reach second-growth of timber in the surrounding areas. A new hardwood sawmill reportedly supplied timber to firms that built weapons and equipment for World War II. Although the mill was effective at keeping the town going for many years, it was never a large enough operation to recoup the huge loss of population. Once with a population of 5,000, during the 1940s, the town had around 400 residents. This is the estimated population in the 21st century.

Of the town&#x27;s population of about 400, around 150 males served in the Armed Forces during World War II. About 46 volunteers also served prior to the bombing of Pearl Harbor. So many citizens served in the war that the town&#x27;s story was featured in the July 6, 1942, edition of &quot;Life&quot; magazine. The story featured a picture of two young boys standing in the deserted streets of D&#x27;Lo with the headline, &quot;D&#x27;Lo Men Have Gone Off to War&quot;, with a caption that stated, &quot;There is a war and a country is in danger. When that happens the men drop what they are doing and go off from the deep southern hamlet of D&#x27;Lo, Miss.&quot; A monument located at the town&#x27;s community center lists the D&#x27;Lo citizens who served during the war.

The name was changed to D&#x27;Lo effective January 1, 1950.

==In popular culture==
* A portion of the 2000 film &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?,&quot; known as the &quot;Siren Scene&quot;, was filmed on the banks of the Strong River at the D&#x27;Lo Water Park.

==Etymology==
Three different stories explain how the odd name originated. The oldest and probably the most common story claims that an early settler referred to this area along the Strong River, where it commonly floods, as being &quot;too damn low&quot;. When it came time for the village to get a post office, he suggested that the village be named &quot;too damn low&quot;, but the postal authorities would not approve of the name because of the profanity. Someone supposedly suggested the name &quot;D-Low&quot;, which over the years was shortened to &quot;D&#x27;Lo&quot;.

Another account said that Millhaven was rejected by the postal authorities as a town name. Purportedly the US Postal Service provided the village with a list of alternative four-letter names for the residents to choose from. Among these names was one spelled &quot;Delo&quot;. After the citizens chose this name, a penman prepared a letter to be sent back to the authorities informing them of the name they had chosen. The letter was written in a script that may have put the lower case &quot;e&quot; in Delo above the &quot;lo&quot;. The story concludes that the little &quot;e&quot; was probably misinterpreted as an apostrophe and therefore the post office documented the village name as being D&#x27;Lo.

The last version involves the adaptation of a French phrase: See .

<text>Mendenhall is a city and the county seat of Simpson County, Mississippi, United States. The population was 2,504 at the 2010 census. Mendenhall is part of the Jackson Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Mendenhall was originally called Edna, to honor the wife of developer Phillip Didlake. After learning that a town with that name already existed in Mississippi, the city had its name changed to Mendenhall to honor Thomas Mendenhall, a citizen and lawyer from Westville, Mississippi (which has become a ghost town).

Mendenhall is the county seat of Simpson County. The county courthouse was built in 1907 by architect Andrew J. Byron.

Weathersby, named for one of its founding families, was an unincorporated census-designated community southeast of Mendenhall, and northeast of Magee. According to Charles Baldwin, Simpson County Tax Collector, Mendenhall annexed Weathersby in the 1980s.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.37%) is water.

==Demographics==

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 2,199 people, 1,024 households, and 641 families residing in the city.

==Entertainment attractions==
Mendenhall had a movie theatre called the Star Theatre, built by Edgar French, Ben Slay and Lonnie Burnham. Located on Main Street, the building boasted a one-screen auditorium with a balcony. It also featured a pool hall and three offices upstairs, one of which housed the city&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce. The theatre opened for business on November 9, 1938 with the western &quot;Born to the West&quot;. The price of admission was 11 cents and a box of popcorn was a dime. A man from Prentiss was initially hired to run the theatre, but he was soon &quot;sent packing&quot; and Edgar French told his son, George Lewis French, &quot;You&#x27;re taking over that picture show&quot;.

Lewis French, who had worked in his father&#x27;s ice plant growing up and was trained as a bookkeeper at Clarks Commercial College in Jackson, had no experience in running a movie theatre. He went to New Orleans to learn how to book movies and run the projection equipment. Aside from time spent serving in Europe as a radio man during World War II, French continued to operate the Star Theatre until he decided to close it in 1971.

During the late 1960s, the Star Theatre had problems with vandalism and growing racial tensions among its young patrons who objected to maintaining segregation. Under Jim Crow customs, black customers were required to sit in the segregated balcony and this only changed after new U.S. legislation was enacted and ended such practices.

In October 1979, a newly remodeled and fully integrated Star Theatre reopened under the ownership of Danny Collins, a young local entrepreneur. Its first movie was the Chuck Norris film &quot;A Force of One&quot;. The theatre enjoyed revived popularity until competition from video arcades and cable TV forced Collins to close some three years later.

The theatre was repainted when used as a location for the film &quot;My Dog Skip&quot;. Heavy rains caused the roof to collapse in April 2008. The theatre burned down in 2016.

<doc id="122430" wikidata="Q2273139" url="?curid=122430" title="Wiggins, Stone County, Mississippi">
<text>Wiggins is a city in and the county seat of Stone County, Mississippi, United States. It is part of the Gulfport–Biloxi, Mississippi Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 4,272 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Wiggins is named after Wiggins Hatten, the father of Madison Hatten, one of the area&#x27;s original homesteaders. It was incorporated in 1904, and the 1910 census reported 980 residents. In the early 1900s, Wiggins prospered along with the booming timber industry. Wiggins was once headquarters of the Finkbine Lumber Company.
On January 21, 1910, between the hours of 11 am and 1 pm, more than half of the Wiggins business district was destroyed by fire. The fire started from unknown origin in the Hammock Building, a lodging house, and spread rapidly because of strong winds from the northwest. With no city fire department or waterworks, the residents of Wiggins resorted to bucket brigades and dynamite to stop the fire, which was confined to the east side of the Gulf and Ship Island Railroad. The fire consumed 41 business establishments, including the Gulf and Ship Island Railroad depot. Only two or three residential dwellings were destroyed, because most homes were built away from the business district.
Wiggins has long been known for its pickle production, and at one time boasted of being home to the world&#x27;s largest pickle processing facility. However, the pickle processing facility is now closed, and although the timber industry has declined since the boom years, it still sustains many businesses in Wiggins.

On June 22, 1935, a mob of 200 white people lynched a black man, R. D. McGee. A white girl had been attacked, and McGee was suspected as the culprit. He was roused from his bed, and taken before the girl. She identified him, a day later, based on the clothing her attacker had been wearing. The same day it was reported that Dewitt Armstrong, another African-American was flogged for making insulting remarks to white women. On November 21, 1938, another black man, Wilder McGowan, was lynched by a mob of 200 white men for allegedly assaulting a 74-year-old woman. An investigator found there was no merit to the charge against McGowan, but rather that he was lynched because he &quot;Did not know his place,&quot; and in addition had rebuffed a group of white men who had invaded a negro dance hall &quot;looking for some good-looking nigger women&quot;. His death certificate indicated strangulation by &quot;rope party&quot;. Although seventeen men were identified as participating in the lynching, the justice department decided no action was merited. In 2016, a group of white students at Stone High School put a noose around a black student&#x27;s neck. The student&#x27;s parent alleged that local law enforcement discouraged their family from filing a report.

In June 2021, Wiggins voters elected their first African-American mayor, Darrell Berry, who had served as mayor pro temp since November 2020 and then interim mayor since January 2021, following the death of the city&#x27;s incumbent mayor. Berry had been an elected Wiggins alderman during three mayoral terms (12 years) prior to his election as mayor. As of June 2021, the city had three African-Americans simultaneously serving on the city council.

===Pine Hill===
After the 1910 fire and until the 1960s, the center of commerce for Wiggins developed on both sides of Pine Avenue, that sloped downhill and eastward, perpendicular to U.S. Route 49 and Railroad Street (First Street), over a distance of one city block. Small shops were built mainly of brick and were mostly contiguous to each other. Over the years, the shops were occupied by numerous businesses that included drug stores, law offices, a grocery store, a shoe store, a dry cleaners, 5 &amp; dime stores, auto supply store, barber shops, cafes, a movie theater, dry goods outlet, feed &amp; seed outlet, an army surplus store, beauty salons, clothing stores, gift shops, County Library, and U.S. Post Office. In more recent years, the shops have served as real estate offices, CPA &amp; tax preparer outlets, an antique store, newspaper office, ice cream shop, art &amp; frame shop, food outlets, and stationery shop.

In the late 1960s, U.S. Route 49 bypassed the downtown area, and many businesses moved from Pine Hill to other locations within Wiggins. The old Wiggins High School and Elementary School buildings occupied a city block, situated at the base of Pine Hill. When the school buildings were demolished in the 1970s, the school land was dedicated to City use as Blaylock Park. In the 1980s, city and county business leaders saw a need for developing a sense of community and tourism by initiating an annual Pine Hill Day, which later became Pine Hill Festival. During Pine Hill Day, area residents offered items for sale as arts &amp; crafts, in farmers&#x27; markets, and as local cuisine. To attract more visitors, other venues such as live music entertainment, competitive foot races, antique vehicle displays, commercial food vendors, and games for kids were added through the years, and the festival became a Spring event. In 2014, an estimated 15,000 people attended the 2-day festival.

<text>Doddsville is a town in Sunflower County, Mississippi. The population was 98 at the 2010 census. It was established by Daniel Doddsman Sr. in 1889.

==History==
Daniel Doddsman Sr. and his eldest son, Daniel Jr. were early settlers who hauled logs in the area in 1888, and purchased of land where the town now stands in 1891. Oliver Eastland, grandfather of U.S. Senator James Eastland, bought a large tract of land near Doddsville in the 1880s, and his son Woods Eastland used black labor to clear the land to create a plantation.

A landing called &quot;Standing Stump&quot; existed west of Doddsville on the bank of the Sunflower River. When river levels rose in the spring, boats from Vicksburg would follow the Yazoo River and then Sunflower River as far as Standing Stump, where a post office was located.

When the Yazoo Delta Railroad was completed in 1897, a depot was located in the town and named &quot;Doddsville&quot;, after the Dodds brothers. By 1898, Doddsville had five stores, and the Sunflower Lumber Company was founded.

Doddsville was incorporated in 1920, and by 1922 the population was estimated at between 400 and 500. There was a hotel and rooming house, two drug stores with licensed pharmacists, two Chinese groceries, a Café, a dress shop, a school, two churches, a woman’s club, four doctors, and five passenger trains a day. The city hall was located inside the Doddsville Land and Mercantile Company store.

A jail was built in 1952, and a town water system installed in 1963.

==The Holbert lynching incident==

In 1904, Luther Holbert, an African-American, allegedly shot and killed white plantation owner James Eastland (uncle of future senator James Eastland), after Eastland confronted Holbert in his cabin. Eastland&#x27;s death gained national attention. Within days, a white mob had captured Holbert and his wife, after which the couple were tortured with oversized corkscrews, had their fingers and ears cut off to distribute to onlookers, and were burned to death while tied to a tree. The Holberts&#x27; gruesome murder inspired Bo Carter&#x27;s 1936 blues hit &quot;All Around Man&quot;, with its references to &quot;the butcher-man&quot;, &quot;screwin&quot;, &quot;grindin&quot;, and &quot;bore your hole till the auger-man comes&quot;.

<text>Drew is a city in Sunflower County, Mississippi, United States. The population was 1,927 at the 2010 census. Drew is in the vicinity of several plantations and the Mississippi State Penitentiary, a Mississippi Department of Corrections prison for men. It is noted for being the site of several racist murders, including the lynching of Joe Pullen in 1923 and of Emmett Till in 1955.

==History==
When the Yellow Dog Railroad was extended through what is now Drew, the post office was moved from the Promised Land Plantation to the Drew location. The settlement and the post office were named for Miss Drew Daniel, daughter of Andrew Jackson Daniel.

A school called the Little Red Schoolhouse was built by matching funds from the Rosenwald Fund in 1928. In the 21st century it received a grant for renovation of the large school.

In the 1920s, a man named Joe Pullen was lynched near Drew after killing at least three members and wounding other members of a posse seeking him after he shot and killed another man.

One historian wrote that the white residents of Drew had &quot;traditionally been regarded as the most recalcitrant in the county on racial matters.&quot; The author wrote that whites in Drew were &quot;considered the most recalcitrant of Sunflower County, and perhaps the state.&quot; He also claimed that Drew&#x27;s proximity to the Mississippi State Penitentiary made Drew &quot;a dangerous place to be black&quot;, and claimed that during the 1930s and 1940s many police officers arbitrarily shot blacks, saying that they appeared to look like escaped prisoners. That historian also claimed that during the Civil Rights Movement, when attempts were made to move Fannie Lou Hamer&#x27;s movement for poor people from Ruleville to Drew, the organizers &quot;faced stiff resistance&quot;. Mae Bertha Carter, an activist during the Civil Rights Movement, was from Drew.

In 1955, 14-year-old African-American teenager Emmett Louis Till was abducted, tortured, and shot to death in a barn near Drew. The killing attracted national attention. Some locals have raised money to purchase the barn for a memorial.

==Geography==

Drew, in northern Sunflower County, is located on U.S. Route 49W, on the route between Jackson and Clarksdale. Drew is south of the Mississippi State Penitentiary, and it is north of Ruleville. Cleveland, Mississippi is from Drew. Drew is north of Yazoo City.

A historic plaque in Moorhead is located where the Southern Railroad once crossed the Yazoo Delta Railroad (known as the &quot;Yellow Dog&quot;). The Southern travelled east-west, and later became the Columbus and Greenville Railway, while the Yellow Dog travelled north-south, and later became the Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad. The level junction (diamond) is still preserved as an historic site, though the north-south line has since been abandoned through Moorhead. This railroad crossing is very significant in the history of blues music. It is widely believed that W. C. Handy, after hearing an old man singing about &quot;where the Southern cross the Yellow Dog&quot;, was moved by the sound and began what came to be known as the &quot;blues&quot;.

==History==
The original county seat, Old Tillatoba, was discovered to have a defective land title, so the seat was removed to Charleston in 1837.

The Charleston Female school, established in 1852, flourished for several years. The &quot;Tallahatchie Herald&quot;, a Democratic weekly newspaper, was established in 1892. In 1901, the Charleston Bank was established. By the early 1900s, Charleston had a brick courthouse and jail, three churches, schools, a Masonic hall, an Odd Fellows lodge, and two cotton gins. Its leading agricultural staple was cotton. The population in 1906 was 800.

In 1931, a magnitude 4.6 earthquake occurred in Charleston, the most powerful earthquake recorded in Mississippi.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and 0.73% is water. It is also situated on the northern end of the concurrency of Mississippi Highways 32 and 35.

The city&#x27;s official nickname is &quot;Gateway to the Delta&quot;.

==Education==
The City of Charleston is served by the East Tallahatchie School District. Before 1970, a dual system of schools, one for black students and another for whites was maintained. In 1970, the federal courts mandated in &quot;Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education&quot; that the schools be integrated, and the school district adopted a plan by which classrooms remained segregated, but during the course of the school day entire classes of children and teachers were bused between East Tallahatchie High School and Allen Carver High School. The black students of Allen Carver protested, and the sheriff arrested 125 of them and sent them to the state penitentiary at Parchman. After intervention by the federal Community Relations Service, the students were allowed to reenter school and makeup missed exams. The classrooms were integrated, new elections were held for student government, and some black cheerleaders were added.

Charleston High School held its first racially integrated prom in April 2008. This event was the subject of the 2008 HBO documentary &quot;Prom Night in Mississippi&quot;. The documentary focused on Charleston High School and the efforts to have a mixed prom instead of the traditional racially segregated proms.

Strider Academy, near the city, closed in 2018.

Coahoma Community College is the designated community college.

<text>Glendora is a village in Tallahatchie County, Mississippi. The population was 285 at the 2000 census.

==History==
Glendora was developed by White Americans as a small sawmill site. Logs were floated down the river from around the vicinity of Webb to be processed here.

The first settlement developed two miles south of Glendora at Black Bayou. When the railroad was built through the territory in 1883, a station was located there and called Glendora. The town immediately grew. A post office was established in 1900 and a voting precinct was established.

Cane Lake Lumber Company built a large sawmill here which operated until 1909. It was moved to another site.

In December 1955, Elmer Kimbrell, a white man, shot and killed Clinton Melton, an African-American resident, in front of three witnesses after an argument about how much gas Melton had pumped into Kimbrell&#x27;s car. Kimbrell was acquitted by an all-white jury after a short trial. Shortly before this murder, he was involved in the Emmett Till murder in Money, Mississippi. At this time, most blacks in Mississippi were still disenfranchised due to state barriers; they were not part of the jury pool because they were not registered voters and they were excluded from the political system.

<doc id="122438" wikidata="Q2301122" url="?curid=122438" title="Sumner, Mississippi">
<text>Sumner is a town in Tallahatchie County, Mississippi. The population was 407 at the 2000 census. Sumner is one of the two county seats of Tallahatchie County. It is located on the west side of the county and the Tallahatchie River, which runs through the county north–south. The other county seat is Charleston, located east of the river. Charleston was the first county seat, as settlement came from the east, and it is the larger of the two towns.

The courthouse has been restored. It also houses the Emmett Till Interpretive Center, which opened in 2012 in his honor. They were designated part of Emmett Till and Mamie Till-Mobley National Monument in 2023.

==Geography==
Sumner is located at (33.969867, -90.369636).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==History==
The heavily wooded swamp along the Tallahatchie River was historically part of the Choctaw Nation, one of the Five Civilized Tribes of the Southeast. Ceding large amounts of territory to the United States, they were forced to remove to Indian Territory in the 1830s under the Indian Removal Act.

Afterward the US government sold the lands to European-American families. Among the early settlers were the Sumner family. The bottomland was covered by trees, vines, and underbrush when the pioneers started clearing the land for agriculture. The wealthiest men developed their property through the labor of enslaved African Americans. Their work on cotton plantations produced the commodity crop that was the basis of the economy for decades.

Sumner was not incorporated until 1900; it was named after its founder and first mayor, Joseph Burton Sumner. In 1902 the county was divided into two districts, on either side of the Tallahatchie River, which was a barrier to cross-county transportation. Charleston was the original county seat, located east of the river in the first area of European-American settlement. Sumner was designated as the seat of the western district.

The Tallahatchie County Courthouse in Sumner was built in 1902 on a lot donated by Joseph B. Sumner, who also donated the lot for the jail. The courthouse burned in 1908 and was rebuilt in 1909. Cotton continued to be the major commodity crop of the area well into the 20th century. The county seat also served as the market town for that district.

This courthouse was the site of the September 1955 murder trial of two white men, J.W. Milam and Roy Bryant, charged in the lynching and murder of Emmett Till that year in adjoining Leflore County. (His beaten and mutilated body was found on the bank of the river in Tallahatchie County, so the trial was held here.) The two men were acquitted by an all-male, all-white jury of the murder of Till, a teenage African-American boy from Chicago. The brutality of his murder and the acquittal of the men generated outrage and activism in the nation. He became an icon of the Civil Rights Movement and a symbol of the violent persecution suffered by blacks in the South.

In 1990, the courthouse was designated as a state landmark by the Mississippi Department of Archives and History. In 2007 the Tallahatchie Board of Supervisors appointed the Emmett Till Memorial Commission to explore commemoration of Till and reconciliation in the area. It made a formal apology to the Till family for their son&#x27;s lynching. In addition, it undertook to restore the Sumner County Courthouse and adapt it as the site of an interpretive center to commemorate Emmett Till. The center opened in 2012 and is sponsoring a variety of art and historical workshops and events.

==Demographics==
The city reached its peak of population in 1940. After that numerous African-American residents left the city and county. Many moved to California and the West Coast during World War II and after, attracted by jobs in the buildup of the defense industries and seeking to escape southern oppression and violence. In addition, mechanization of agriculture had made much farm labor unneeded. African Americans moving from Sumner were part of the Great Migration, by which some 5 million blacks moved out of the Deep South from 1940 to 1970.

<text>Tutwiler is a town in Tallahatchie County, Mississippi, United States. The population at the 2020 census was 2,476.

==History==

In 1899, Tom Tutwiler, a civil engineer for a local railroad, made his headquarters seven miles northwest of Sumner. The town of Tutwiler was founded and named for him. When the railroad was built, the first depot erected was a two-story building. The railroad gave the town use of the top floor as a public school. Captain H.B. Fitch built and operated the first store in town. His wife took charge of the school, which began with five pupils.

In 1900, a Black mob murdered a Black man remembered as &quot;Dago Pete.&quot; He was suspected of attacking local women.

In 1905, the town was incorporated, and W.E. Fite elected Mayor. J.O. Clay was the station depot agent. In 1900, the Illinois Central Railroad, running from Yazoo City to Lambert, crossed at Tutwiler, where the company built a railroad yard.

In 1928, a high school was built at a cost of $40,000. The town grew rapidly until 1929 when the railroad yard was moved to Clarksdale. At that time businesses and finally the population began to decline. The population in 1929 before the railroad yard was moved was 1,010 people.

Like many other towns in the Mississippi Delta, Tutwiler stakes a claim to being the &quot;birthplace of the blues&quot;. This is the site where W. C. Handy reportedly &quot;discovered&quot; the blues in 1903, on a train platform in the town. Handy had heard something akin to the blues as early as 1892, but it was while waiting for an overdue train to Memphis that he heard an itinerant bluesman (legend says it was a local field hand named Henry Sloan). The man was playing slide guitar and singing about &quot;goin&#x27; where the Southern cross the Dog&quot;, referring to the junction of the Southern Railway and Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad farther south. (The Y&amp;D railroad was locally called the &quot;Yellow Dog&quot;). Handy called it &quot;the weirdest music I had ever heard&quot;. A Mississippi Blues Trail marker honoring Handy was erected at the site on November 25, 2009. The historic marker was paid for by Robert Plant and Robert attended the dedication and gave a speech about the Blues and how he was influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson II. Robert Plant said &quot;The first record my mom bought me was by Sonny Boy, I played it until there were no more groves on the record&quot;. Sonny Boy&#x27;s resting place is just at the edge of the Tutwiler City limits. Robert and Jimmy Page visit Tutwiler often, it is a wonderful place to connect to the music that changed my life and musical direction, a magic place. Tutwiler was also the childhood home of bluesmen John Lee Hooker and Frank Stokes.

Handy and his family lived there for six years. In 1903, while waiting for a train in Tutwiler, in the Mississippi Delta, Handy had the following experience: 
A lean loose-jointed Negro had commenced plunking a guitar beside me while I slept ... As he played, he pressed a knife on the strings of the guitar in a manner popularized by Hawaiian guitarists who used steel bars. ... The singer repeated the line three times, accompanying himself on the guitar with the weirdest music I had ever heard.

==Economy==

Peter T. Kilborn of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said in 2001 that, &quot;Except for cotton, there has never been much to Tutwiler&#x27;s economy.&quot; As of 2001, Tutwiler residents work in prisons located throughout the Mississippi Delta, casinos in Tunica Resorts, and poultry and chicken processing plants in the surrounding area.

The town&#x27;s sole bank and grain elevator closed in 2000. As of 2001 Tutwiler did not have any clothing stores, drugstores, or restaurants.

Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility, a private prison operated by CoreCivic, Inc for the Mississippi Department of Corrections, is located near Tutwiler in an unincorporated area in the county. Due to the town&#x27;s poor economic status, around 1998 the leaders of Tutwiler decided to agree to construction of a prison nearby, which would provide hundreds of jobs.

To help facilitate the prison, the Town of Tutwiler constructed a sewage lagoon and a water tower. The State of Mississippi and Tallahatchie County paid half of the cost of training of the correctional officers at the new prison. Kilborn said that when the $35 million facility opened in 2000 with 351 prisoners, including 322 from Wisconsin, it &quot;seemed the salvation of&quot; Tutwiler. Some area residents quit their jobs and began working as prison guards at the facility. After the prison&#x27;s opening, its monthly payroll was $467,000.

In March and April 2001 Wisconsin moved its prisoners out of the prison, leaving about 20 to 125 prisoners per period. Before this change, the prison had 208 employees. The prison&#x27;s employees were reduced to 40. Hundreds of people who had worked at the prison were laid off. As of 2001, the prison had paid $600,000 to the county in property taxes annually and $5,350 per month to the town for water. By the end of 2001 the total monthly payroll decreased to $80,000.

Kilborn said that by November 2001 the prison &quot;left the town little better off than it ever was.&quot; In June 2003 the prison received 1,423 inmates from Alabama, and the prison hired 250 employees during that year to care for them. By 2010 the prison was also incarcerating sentenced prisoners from California.

==Government and infrastructure==
Robert Grayson made history in 1993 by being elected as the first African-American mayor of Tutwiler. He was a former corrections officer at the Mississippi State Penitentiary (Parchman) in Sunflower County. Grayson was succeeded in 2009 by Genether Miller Spurlock, a former schoolteacher, and first black woman to be elected as mayor. The current mayor of Tutwiler is Nichole Harris-Rosebud. The town maintains a police force of about ten police officers. 
The United States Postal Service operates the Tutwiler Post Office.

Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility, a private prison operated by the Corrections Corporation of America on behalf of the Mississippi Department of Corrections, is located in an unincorporated area in Tallahatchie County, near Tutwiler. As of 2010 the prison serves as the Tallahatchie County&#x27;s jail facility, in addition to housing primarily prison inmates sentenced by California courts.

There was one saloon at that time called &quot;The Razzle Dazzle&quot;. The town was incorporated in 1905.

In those days most of the groceries and necessities were brought to Hood by flat bottom boat from Sharkey, Mississippi, being hauled down the river from Friars Point. Cassidy Bayou was navigable then and was maintained by the government from Sharkey to Hood. The town was later renamed in honor of Judge Webb.

== History ==

Iuka is built on the site of a Chickasaw village that is thought to have been subordinate to the settlement at Underwood Village. The name &quot;Iuka&quot; comes from the name of one of the chiefs of the village. Iuka was founded by David Hubbard, a wagon train scout.

Euro-American settlers arrived with the Memphis and Charleston Railroad in 1857. Before the American Civil War, the town boasted an all-female college, a boys&#x27; military academy, and a fine hotel. The Civil War brought widespread devastation when a major engagement here occurred on September 19, 1862. The Battle of Iuka resulted in 1200 to 1500 killed or wounded. The dead Confederate soldiers were buried in a long trench that eventually became Shady Grove Cemetery.
The first normal school built in the former Confederacy after the Civil War, Iuka Normal Institute, was built here. However, the town did not return to prosperity for many years. The building of Pickwick Landing Dam and Pickwick Lake by the Tennessee Valley Authority brought activity back to the town.

In 1904, water from Iuka&#x27;s mineral springs won first prize for the purest and best mineral water at the World&#x27;s Fair in St. Louis.

<text>Tunica is a town in and the county seat of Tunica County, Mississippi, United States, near the Mississippi River. Until the early 1990s when casino gambling was introduced in the area, Tunica had been one of the most impoverished places in the United States. Despite this economic improvement, Tunica&#x27;s population continues to decline from its peak in 1970.

==History==
The community derives its name from the Tunica Indians which once were numerous in the area. Tunica is the fourth community to serve as county seat of Tunica County, succeeding earlier county seats at Commerce (1839–1842, 1842–1847), Peyton (1842, temporary) and Austin (1847–1888).

Tunica gained national attention for its deprived neighborhood known as &quot;Sugar Ditch Alley&quot;, named for the open sewer located there. Its fortunes have improved since development of a gambling resort area nearby during the early 1990s. While population growth has taken place mostly outside Tunica, the major casinos employ numerous locals. They attract visitors from nearby Memphis, Tennessee, West Memphis, Arkansas and all over the Southeastern United States.

==Geography==
Tunica is located approximately south of Downtown Memphis, Tennessee.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , all land.

==Demographics==

===2020 census===

As of the 2020 United States Census, there were 1,026 people, 501 households, and 293 families residing in the town.

===2000 census===

About 17.1% of families and 25.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 33.3% of those under age 18 and 21.3% of those age 65 or over.

== Casino economy ==
Casino gambling&#x27;s effect on the local economy has spurred population growth in unincorporated parts of the county outside Tunica proper. Since 1990, the town&#x27;s name has been popularly associated with several casinos located near the Mississippi River. However, the current group of casinos is located in the community of Tunica Resorts, 10 miles north of the town of Tunica, and extending to the DeSoto County line.

Tunica Resorts was originally named &quot;Robinsonville&quot;, but the name was changed in 2005 to eliminate confusion over the location of the casinos, which have always used the name &quot;Tunica&quot; as an identifier. The success of these gaming houses in northern Tunica County came at the expense of the area&#x27;s first group of casinos in the early 1990s, located just northwest of Tunica proper, in an area known as Mhoon Landing. This now comprises the current census-designated place of North Tunica. These casinos were closed or moved as larger resorts opened closer to Memphis to attract its larger residential base.

Unlike the area including casinos along Mississippi&#x27;s Gulf Coast region, Tunica was not in the path of Hurricane Katrina. As a result, some of the regular Gulf Coast customer traffic from casinos drifted northward to Tunica County while repairs and reconstruction were underway in the Gulf Coast locations.

Though the casinos lie outside the town limits, the benefits of tax revenue generated have also aided the town. Major improvements to the public school system and downtown district are among the most visible aspects. Long-term effects include major highway improvements on U.S. Route 61 and a much-discussed potential expansion of Tunica Municipal Airport.

As of 2007, some Tunica Resorts residents are trying to incorporate their community as a separate town government, rather than operate under the jurisdiction of Tunica County or be annexed into the town of Tunica. If Tunica Resorts incorporates, the new town government would directly benefit from casino tax revenue, enabling construction of municipal government offices. Depending on population and revenue growth, fire and police stations, libraries and other public infrastructure could be other likely additions.

==Education==
The Town of Tunica is served by the Tunica County School District. Zoned schools include Tunica Elementary School, Tunica Middle School, and Rosa Fort High School.

Tunica Academy is located in an unincorporated area in Tunica County, near Tunica.

== In popular culture ==
Tunica is mentioned in Elmore Leonard&#x27;s 2002 novel &quot;Tishomingo Blues&quot;.

==Notable people==
* Brandon Bryant, NFL Player
* James Cotton, blues harmonica player
* Parker Hall, 1939 Most Valuable Player of the National Football League
* Charlaine Harris, New York Times bestselling author
* Donald Hawkins, NFL Player
* Benardrick McKinney, NFL linebacker

== Transportation ==
Tunica Municipal Airport has had airline service intermittently with aircraft such as Boeing 727 jets of Pan Am Clipper Connection and Boeing 737 jets of Air Tran offering commercial services. The closest airport with continuous airline service is Memphis International Airport in Memphis, Tennessee, which is about 30 minutes away by car.

<text>New Albany is a city in and the county seat of Union County, Mississippi, United States. According to the 2020 United States Census, the population was 7,626.

==History==
New Albany was founded in 1840 at the site of a grist mill and sawmill on the Tallahatchie River near the intersection of two Chickasaw trade trails. The town developed as a river port and as a regional center for agriculture and commerce. 

During the Civil War, the United States Cavalry under Benjamin Grierson passed through New Albany on their way to raid Vicksburg, when they encountered Confederate troops attempting to destroy the bridge over the Tallahatchie. The Confederate troops fled and the bridge was preserved.

Union County was formed from parts of neighboring Pontotoc, and Tippah Counties in 1870, with New Albany designated as county seat. In the late 1880s, two railroads (the Kansas City, Memphis and Birmingham Railroad and the Gulf and Ship Island Railroad) came to New Albany, about the time its population of 600 were rebuilding after a severe fire. In 2013, a section of railroad was paved to become the Tanglefoot Trail, following the path of a rail that was once operated by author William Faulkner&#x27;s grandfather.

In 1925, L. Q. Ivy, a 17-year-old African American boy, was accused of beating and raping a 21-year old White woman.
A crowd of 4,000 gathered in New Albany and despite efforts from the victim&#x27;s father and US senator Hubert D. Stephens to prevent a lynching, the crowd gained control, torturing and killing Ivy.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (0.35%) is water.

The average household size was 2.42 and the average family size was 3.02.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 26.3% under the age of 18, 8.8% from 18 to 24, 27.1% from 25 to 44, 20.5% from 45 to 64, and 17.4% who were 65 years of age or older.

==Education==
From its inception until 1964, a segregated school system was maintained, with one set of schools for White students and another for Black students. In 1901, the first school building dedicated entirely to public education was built with 18 classrooms. The only high school in Union County for Black students was Union County Training School in New Albany, which was founded in 1812. Like other schools for African-American students, the Training School was not government funded. In 1964, the school system began a slow process of integrating the races. Elementary schools were integrated first, then higher grades were added. Integration was completed in 1970, and at that time African American students made up 29 percent of the district&#x27;s students and 20 percent of faculty.

Almost all of the city of New Albany is served by the New Albany School District while small portions are in the Union County School District.

The city is the location of a satellite campus of Northeast Mississippi Community College located at 301 North Street.

The New Albany High School Bulldogs boys basketball team won consecutive state Class 3A titles in 1985, 1986, and 1987. Former NBA player John Stroud coached the 1987 team.

==Infrastructure==
=== Transportation ===
New Albany is bisected by Interstate 22 (US Highway 78).

New Albany is connected to Ripley in the North and Pontotoc to the South by State Highway 15. Highway 30 connects New Albany and Oxford to the West and Booneville to the Northeast, although when traveling from Oxford towards Booneville an alternate route must be taken within the city limits.

New Albany is served by BNSF Railway (formerly St. Louis – San Francisco Railway) and the Ripley and New Albany Railroad (formerly Gulf, Mobile and Ohio). The two railroads cross downtown. A portion of rail has been paved to become the Tanglefoot Trail, the longest rail-trail in Mississippi.

New Albany was once a stop for Gulf, Mobile and Ohio&#x27;s famous &quot;Rebel&quot; streamlined passenger train.

The town serves as the northern terminus of the Tanglefoot Trail, a major rail-trail within the state.

<doc id="122459" wikidata="Q493787" url="?curid=122459" title="Vicksburg, Mississippi">
<text>Vicksburg is a historic city in Warren County, Mississippi, United States. It is the county seat. The population was 21,573 at the 2020 census. Located on a high bluff on the east bank of the Mississippi River across from Louisiana, Vicksburg was built by French colonists in 1719. The outpost withstood an attack from the native Natchez people. It was incorporated as Vicksburg in 1825 after Methodist missionary Newitt Vick. The area that is now Vicksburg was long occupied by the Natchez Native Americans as part of their historical territory along the Mississippi. The first Europeans who settled the area were French colonists who built Fort Saint Pierre in 1719 on the high bluffs overlooking the Yazoo River at present-day Redwood. They conducted fur trading with the Natchez and others, and started plantations. During the American Civil War, it was a key Confederate river-port, and its July 1863 surrender to Ulysses S. Grant, along with the concurrent Battle of Gettysburg, marked the turning-point of the war.

After the war came the Reconstruction era and then a violent return to power by white supremacists and the Democratic Party in 1874 and 1875, including the Vicksburg massacre. Today, Vicksburg&#x27;s population is majority African American. The city is home to three large installations of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which has often been involved in local flood control.

==History==
===First people===
The area that is now Vicksburg was long occupied by the Natchez Native Americans as part of their historical territory along the Mississippi. The Natchez spoke a language isolate not related to the Muskogean languages of the other major tribes in the area. Before the Natchez, other indigenous cultures had occupied this strategic area for thousands of years.

===European settlement===
The first Europeans who settled the area were French colonists who built Fort Saint Pierre in 1719 on the high bluffs overlooking the Yazoo River at present-day Redwood. They conducted fur trading with the Natchez and others, and started plantations. On 29 November 1729, the Natchez attacked the fort and plantations in and around the present-day city of Natchez. They murdered several hundred settlers, including Jesuit missionary Paul Du Poisson. As was the custom, they violently took a number of women and children as captives, adopting them into their families.

The Natchez War was a disaster for French Louisiana, and the colonial population of the Natchez District never recovered. Aided by the Choctaw, traditional enemies of the Natchez, though, the French defeated and scattered the Natchez and their allies, the Yazoo.

The Choctaw Nation took over the area by right of conquest and inhabited it for several decades. Under pressure from the US government, the Choctaw agreed to cede nearly of land to the US under the terms of the Treaty of Fort Adams in 1801. The treaty was the first of a series that eventually led to the removal of most of the Choctaw to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River in 1830. Some Choctaw remained in Mississippi, citing article XIV of the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek; they became citizens of the state and the United States. They struggled to maintain their culture against the pressure of the binary slave society, which classified people as only white or black.

In 1790, the Spanish founded a military outpost on the site, which they called Fort Nogales (&quot;nogales&quot; meaning &quot;walnut trees&quot;). When the Americans took possession in 1798 following the American Revolutionary War and a treaty with Spain, they changed the name to Walnut Hills. The small village was incorporated in 1825 as Vicksburg, named after Newitt Vick, a Methodist minister who had established a Protestant mission on the site.

The town of Vicksburg was incorporated in 1825, with a population of 3,000 people; of which approximately twenty people were Jewish and had immigrated from Bavaria, Prussia, and Alsace–Lorraine.

In 1835, during the Murrell Excitement, a mob from Vicksburg attempted to expel the gamblers from the city, because the citizens were tired of the rougher element treating the city residents with contempt. They captured and hanged five gamblers who had shot and killed a local doctor. Historian Joshua D. Rothman calls this event &quot;the deadliest outbreak of extralegal violence in the slave states between the Southampton Insurrection and the Civil War.&quot;

In 1862, fifty Jewish families formed the Hebrew Benevolent Congregation Anshe Chesed in Vicksburg, and received a charter from the state. Two years later in 1864, the Anshe Chesed Cemetery was formed, and it was the second Jewish cemetery in the city; not much is known about the first Jewish cemetery.

The Confederate president, Jefferson Davis, was based at his family plantation at Brierfield, just south of the city.

===Civil War===
During the American Civil War (1861–1865), the city finally surrendered during the Siege of Vicksburg, after which the Union Army gained control of the entire Mississippi River. The 47-day siege was intended to starve the city into submission. Its location atop a high bluff overlooking the Mississippi River proved otherwise impregnable to assault by federal troops. The surrender of Vicksburg by Confederate General John C. Pemberton on July 4, 1863, together with the defeat of General Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg the day before, has historically marked the turning point of the Civil War in the Union&#x27;s favor.

From the surrender of Vicksburg until the end of the war in 1865, the area was under Union military occupation.

Celebrations of the 4th of July, the day of surrender, were irregular until 1947. The &quot;Vicksburg Evening Post&quot; of July 4, 1883, called July 4 &quot;the day we don&#x27;t celebrate&quot;, and another Vicksburg newspaper, the &quot;Daily Commercial Appeal&quot;, in 1888 hoped that a political victory would bring an enthusiastic celebration the following year. In 1902, the 4th of July saw only &quot;a parade of colored draymen&quot;. In 1947, the Jackson &quot;Clarion-Ledger&quot; stated that the city of Vicksburg did not celebrate the 4th of July again until 1945, and then it was celebrated as Confederate Carnival Day. A recent scholar disagrees, stating that large Fourth of July celebrations were being held by 1907, and informal celebrations before that. A large parade was held in 1890.

===Loss of Mississippi access and commercial status===

Because of Vicksburg&#x27;s location on the Mississippi River, it built extensive trade from the prodigious steamboat traffic in the 19th century. It shipped out cotton coming to it from surrounding counties and was a major trading city in West Central Mississippi.

However, in 1876, a Mississippi River flood cut off the large meander next to Vicksburg through the De Soto Point, which changed the Mississippi River&#x27;s course away from the city. Vicksburg only retained access to an oxbow lake formed from the old channel of the river, which effectively isolated the city from accessing the Mississippi riverfront. The city&#x27;s economy suffered greatly due to the lack of a functional river port; Vicksburg would not be a river town again until the completion of the Yazoo Diversion Canal in 1903 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

===Political and racial unrest after Civil War===

In the first few years after the Civil War, white Confederate veterans developed the Ku Klux Klan, beginning in Tennessee; it had chapters throughout the South and attacked freedmen and their supporters. It was suppressed about 1870. By the mid-1870s, new white paramilitary groups had arisen in the Deep South, including the Red Shirts in Mississippi, as whites struggled to regain political and social power over the black majority. Elections were marked by violence and fraud as white Democrats worked to suppress black Republican voting.

In August 1874, a black sheriff, Peter Crosby, was elected in Vicksburg. Letters by a white planter, Batchelor, detail the preparations of whites for what he described as a &quot;race war,&quot; including acquisition of the newest Winchester guns. On December 7, 1874, white men disrupted a black Republican meeting celebrating Crosby&#x27;s victory and held him in custody before running him out of town. He advised blacks from rural areas to return home; along the way, some were attacked by armed whites. During the next several days, armed white mobs swept through black areas, killing other men at home or out in the fields, in what would come to be known as the Vicksburg massacre. Sources differ as to total fatalities, with 29–50 blacks and 2 whites reported dead at the time. Twenty-first-century historian Emilye Crosby estimates that 300 blacks were killed in the city and the surrounding area of Claiborne County, Mississippi. The Red Shirts were active in Vicksburg and other Mississippi areas, and black pleas to the federal government for protection were not met.

At the request of Republican Governor Adelbert Ames, who had left the state during the violence, President Ulysses S. Grant sent federal troops to Vicksburg in January 1875. In addition, a congressional committee investigated what was called the &quot;Vicksburg Riot&quot; at the time (and reported as the &quot;Vicksburg massacre&quot; by northern newspapers.) Testimony from both black and white residents was given, as reported by the &quot;New York Times&quot;, but no one was ever prosecuted for the deaths. The Red Shirts and other white insurgents suppressed Republican voting by both whites and blacks; smaller-scale riots were staged in the state up to the 1875 elections, at which time white Democrats regained control of a majority of seats in the state legislature.

Under new constitutions, amendments and laws passed between 1890 in Mississippi and 1908 in the remaining southern states, white Democrats disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites by creating barriers to voter registration, such as poll taxes, literacy tests, and grandfather clauses. They passed Jim Crow laws through which they imposed racial segregation of public facilities. In 1908, a publication documented some of Vicksburg&#x27;s leading African Americans including lawyer and banker W. E. Mollison.

On March 12, 1894, the popular soft drink Coca-Cola was bottled for the first time in Vicksburg by Joseph A. Biedenharn, a local confectioner. Today, surviving 19th-century Biedenharn soda bottles are prized by collectors of Coca-Cola memorabilia. The original candy store has been renovated and is used as the Biedenharn Coca-Cola Museum.

===20th century===
The exclusion of most blacks from the political system lasted for decades until after Congressional passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s. Lynchings of blacks and other forms of white racial terrorism against them continued to occur in Vicksburg after the start of the 20th century. In May 1903, for instance, two black men charged with murdering a planter were taken from jail by a mob of 200 farmers and lynched before they could go to trial. In May 1919, as many as a thousand white men broke down three sets of steel doors to abduct, hang, burn and shoot a black prisoner, Lloyd Clay, who was falsely accused of raping a white woman. From 1877 to 1950 in Warren County, 14 African Americans were lynched by whites, most in the decades near the turn of the century.

The United States Army Corps of Engineers diverted the Yazoo River in 1903 into the old, shallowing channel to revive the waterfront of Vicksburg. The port city was able to receive steamboats again, but much freight and passenger traffic had moved to railroads, which had become more competitive.

Railroad access to the west across the river continued to be by transfer steamers and ferry barges until a combination railroad-highway bridge was built in 1929. After 1973, Interstate 20 bridged the river. Freight rail traffic still crosses by the old bridge. North-south transportation links are by the Mississippi River and U.S. Highway 61. Vicksburg has the only crossing over the Mississippi River between Greenville and Natchez, and the only interstate highway crossing of the river between Baton Rouge and Memphis.

During the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, in which hundreds of thousands of acres were inundated, Vicksburg served as the primary gathering point for refugees. Relief parties put up temporary housing, as the flood submerged a large percentage of the Mississippi Delta.

Because of the overwhelming damage from the flood, the US Army Corps of Engineers established the Waterways Experiment Station as the primary hydraulics laboratory, to develop protection of important croplands and cities. Now known as the Engineer Research and Development Center, it applies military engineering, information technology, environmental engineering, hydraulic engineering, and geotechnical engineering to problems of flood control and river navigation.

In December 1953, a severe tornado swept across Vicksburg, causing 38 deaths and destroying nearly 1,000 buildings.During World War II, cadets from the Royal Air Force, flying from their training base at Terrell, Texas, routinely flew to Vicksburg on training flights. The town served as a stand-in for the British for Cologne, Germany, which is the same distance from London, England as Vicksburg is from Terrell.

Particularly after World War II, in which many blacks served, returning veterans began to be active in the civil rights movement, wanting to have full citizenship after fighting in the war. In Mississippi, activists in the Vicksburg Movement became prominent during the 1960s.

===Early 21st century===
In 2001, a group of Vicksburg residents visited the Paducah, Kentucky, mural project, looking for ideas for their own community development. In 2002, the Vicksburg Riverfront murals program was begun by Louisiana mural artist Robert Dafford and his team on the floodwall located on the waterfront in downtown. Subjects for the murals were drawn from the history of Vicksburg and the surrounding area. They include President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s bear hunt, the &quot;Sultana&quot;, the &quot;Sprague&quot;, the Siege of Vicksburg, the Kings Crossing site, Willie Dixon, the Flood of 1927, the 1953 Vicksburg, Mississippi tornado, Rosa A. Temple High School (known for integration activism) and the Vicksburg National Military Park. The project was finished in 2009 with the completion of the Jitney Jungle/Glass Kitchen mural.

In the fall of 2010, a new 55-foot mural was painted on a section of wall on Grove Hill across the street from the original project by former Dafford muralists Benny Graeff and Herb Roe. The mural&#x27;s subject is the annual &quot;Run thru History&quot; held in the Vicksburg National Military Park.

On December 6–7, 2014, a symposium was held on the 140th anniversary of the 1874 riots. A variety of scholars gave papers and an open panel discussion was held on the second day at the Vicksburg National Military Park, in collaboration with the Jacqueline House African American Museum.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

Vicksburg is located at the confluence of the Mississippi and Yazoo Rivers. Much of the city is on top of a high bluff on the east bank of the Mississippi River. Vicksburg is also served by Interstate 20. The interstate opens Vicksburg with a cloverleaf interchange that heads out to U.S. Route 61 North towards Rolling Fork, Mississippi, Clarksdale, Mississippi, and stretches out for another 77 miles towards Memphis, Tennessee. On the south part of the exit, it heads on Mississippi Highway 27 towards Utica, Mississippi. As the interstate goes on it makes interchanges with Clay Street, Indiana Avenue, and Halls Ferry Road. After the downtown interchanges are over, before finally crossing in Louisiana with a cloverleaf interchange, I-20 makes a directional T interchange with US-61, and US-61 heads south toward Port Gibson, Mississippi, Natchez, Mississippi, and then continues for another 92 miles into Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Louisiana&#x27;s capital city. Interstate 20 then continues to head west towards Monroe, Louisiana, Shreveport, Louisiana, Dallas, and lastly after 445 miles, making a trumpet interchange with Interstate 10 in Toyah, Texas.

The Yazoo and Mississippi Valley Railroad and then the Illinois Central Railroad for several decades had passenger service through the city, at two different stations, one on Levee Street, and the other on Cherry Street. The IC&#x27;s &quot;Planter&quot; went north to Memphis, Tennessee and south to New Orleans. The Chery Street station hosted the &quot;Northeastern Limited&quot; and an unnamed train east to Jackson and Meridian (sleeping car passengers could continue to New York; coach passengers could transfer at Meridian&#x27;s Union Station to an Atlanta and New York bound train there), and the &quot;Southwestern Limited&quot; and another train west to Monroe and Shreveport&#x27;s Union Station. The final train serving Vicksburg was the &quot;Southwestern Limited/Northeastern Limited&quot; in 1967.

<doc id="122461" wikidata="Q988112" url="?curid=122461" title="Greenville, Mississippi">
<text>Greenville is the ninth-most populous city in the U.S. state of Mississippi, and the largest city by population in the Mississippi Delta region. It is the county seat of Washington County. The population was 29,670 at the 2020 Census.

==History==
===Early history===
This area was occupied by indigenous peoples for thousands of years. When the French explored here, they encountered the historic Natchez people. As part of their colony known as &quot;La Louisiane&quot;, the French established a settlement at what became Natchez, Mississippi. Other Native American tribes also lived in what is now known as Mississippi.

The current city of Greenville is the third in the State to bear the name. The first, (known as Old Greenville) located to the south near Natchez, was the Jefferson County seat from 1803-1825 but became defunct soon after the American Revolution, as European-American settlement was then still concentrated in the eastern states. This ghost town was in no way related to the second Greenville except that they eventually shared a name.

Many migrants came to the area of the future, second Greenville, located approximately 150 miles north of the first Greenville, from the eastern and Upper South states, seeking land for developing cotton plantations, and this area became a trading center for the region&#x27;s plantations. In 1830 the United States Congress passed the Indian Removal Act, which authorized the government to make treaties to extinguish Native American land claims in exchange for lands west of the Mississippi River. They forced most of the Southeastern tribes to Indian Territory during the following decade.

After it became necessary to move the county seat of Washington County in 1844 due to loss of land to the newly formed Issaquena County, the not-yet established second Greenville was designated to be the future county seat and finally became so upon its founding in 1847. American William W. Blanton filed for land from the United States government and was granted section four, township eighteen, range eight west; this plot now constitutes most of current downtown Greenville (the third). It was named by its founders for General Nathanael Greene, friend of President George Washington, for whom the county was named. This Greenville was thriving hamlet in the antebellum years, as cotton plantations developed in the area generated high profits for major planters. They used indentured Whites, captured Indians and African slaves as farmhands on the plantations.

Washington County&#x27;s two previous county seats, New Mexico and Princeton, were located along the Mississippi River and had been eroded by the waters, to the point that they were destroyed. As county seat, Greenville was the trading, business, and cultural center for the large cotton plantations that surrounded it. Most plantations were located directly on the Mississippi and other major navigable tributaries. The interior bottomlands were not developed until after the Civil War. 
===The destruction of Greenville and the Civil War===
The town (the second Greenville, eventually also referred to as Old Greenville by its residents who may not have been familiar with Mississippi&#x27;s first Greenville, which by then had disappeared) was destroyed during the Union Army&#x27;s actions related to the siege of Vicksburg. Troops from a Union gunboat landed at Greenville. In retaliation for being fired upon, they burned every building. The inhabitants took refuge in plantation homes of the area. When the war ended, veterans of Mississippi regiments returned to find Greenville in a state of ruin.

The former residents soon decided to build again. They chose a new site (the third, current Greenville) three miles away, at the highest point on the Mississippi River between the towns of Vicksburg and Memphis. Much of the land belonged to the Roach and Blanton families; the major part of the area selected was within property owned by Mrs. Harriet Blanton Theobald. She welcomed the idea of a new Greenville, and donated land for schools, churches and public buildings. She was called the &quot;Mother of Greenville&quot;. Major Richard O’Hea, who had planned the wartime defense fortifications at Vicksburg, was hired to lay out the new town.

Greenville recovered prosperity, still based on cotton, despite the decline in world markets for this commodity. In the early 20th century, its elite families had considerable political influence in the state, and US Senator Leroy Percy was from here. Several residences and other buildings from the late 19th and early 20th centuries have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was a center of Delta culture in the early 20th century. This city adapted the former site to serve as industrial fill.

===Nelson Street===

African Americans in the Delta developed rich varieties of innovative music. Nelson Street is a historic strip of blues clubs that drew crowds in the 1940s and 1950s to the flourishing club scene to hear Delta blues, big band, jump blues and jazz. Record companies came to Greenville to recruit talent. It was similar to Beale Street in mid-20th century Memphis.

In the early 21st century, the Mississippi Blues Commission was established to commemorate this music in the state&#x27;s history and culture. It has identified sites throughout the Delta as part of the Mississippi Blues Trail.

Southern Whispers Restaurant on Nelson Street in Greenville was the second site identified on this trail; this was a stop on the Chitlin&#x27; Circuit in the early days of the blues. The historic marker in front of the restaurant commemorates its importance in the history of the blues in Mississippi.

===21st century===
In 2020 the city ordered churches to shut down to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and issued citations and fines to those attending a drive-in church gathering. The U.S. Justice Department intervened on behalf of the church.

==Geography==

Greenville is located on the eastern bank of Lake Ferguson, an oxbow lake left from an old channel of the Mississippi River.

One floating casino is located on the lake near the downtown area known as the Trop Casino Greenville, with a second just west of the city near the Greenville Bridge known as Harlow&#x27;s Casino Resort. Chicago Mill and Lumber Co. operated a lumber mill on the lake two-tenths of a mile south of the casino levee parking lot; the mill specialized in making hardwood boxes until it closed.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (2.82%) is water.

U.S. Highway 82 is a major part of the Mississippi Delta&#x27;s transportation network, as it connects to Interstate 55 and other major four-lane highways. In addition, the U.S. Highway 82 bypass is being constructed to provide a transportation route at the southern end of the Delta, connecting at the new Mississippi River Bridge and ending near Leland. The four-lane Greenville Bridge, a $206 million cable-stayed span crossing the Mississippi River into Arkansas, opened in 2010, replacing the two-lane Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge, which opened in 1940.

=== Rail ===
The Columbus and Greenville Railway operates the Greenwood–Greenville rail line for freight traffic. North of Greenville, the Great River Railroad&#x27;s line to Rosedale branches off.

Circa 2008 there were ten grocery stores operated by ethnic Chinese people. There were 42 such stores in the city in 1951, but since then there had been a flight of ethnic Chinese from the Delta.

==Education==
Most of Greenville is served by the Greenville Public School District, while a small portion of the city lies in the Western Line School District. Greenville High School is the public high school of the Greenville district, while O&#x27;Bannon High School serves Western Line residents.

The private schools, Washington School and Greenville Christian School, also serve the city, as well as St. Joseph Catholic School (K-12), a parochial school which is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Jackson. The diocese formerly operated Our Lady of Lourdes Elementary School, which merged into St. Joseph in 2016.

The Greenville Higher Education Center offers non-credit community courses and credit courses from Delta State University, Mississippi Delta Community College (MDCC), and Mississippi Valley State University. All of Washington County is in the service area of MDCC.

==Sites==

The Winterville Mounds Historic Site, with more than twelve earthwork mounds constructed by people of the Plaquemine Mississippian culture, is a survival north of the county seat of the deep indigenous history along the Mississippi River. This culture was particularly prominent from 13th to the 15th centuries, long before European exploration. Earthwork mounds were built by peoples in this area from the 9th century. The people in this region were influenced by the larger Mississippian culture, which built similar ceremonial sites throughout the Mississippi Valley and its tributaries. The historic Natchez people are considered the only contemporary surviving group of the Mississippian culture at the time of European exploration.

The Winterville Mounds has been designated as a state park and National Historic Landmark. A museum on the grounds displays artifacts recovered in professional excavations and adds to the interpretation of this complex, and the park has walking trails. It is located about 3 miles north of the city. It can be reached at 2415 Highway 1 N.

==In popular culture==
The movies &quot;Crossroads&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Reivers&quot; (1969) were filmed in Greenville.

<text>Hollandale is a city in Washington County, Mississippi, United States. The population was 2,323 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Hollandale was named for Dr. Holland, the original owner of the town site.
Hollandale was incorporated in 1890, and almost completely destroyed by fire in 1904.

A one-room school house in Hollandale was founded by Emory Peter &quot;E.P.&quot; Simmons in 1891. One of the first schools for African-American children in the area, it was used until 1923, when financial support from the Rosenwald Fund enabled the construction of a larger brick school. Simmons worked as an educator and administrator for 52 years, and Simmons High School in Hollandale is named in his honor.

Thomas Roosevelt &quot;T.R.&quot; Sanders was a noted community leader. Sanders was principal of Simmons High School for 33 years, and the first superintendent of the Hollandale Colored School District. Sanders developed &#x27;Sanders Estates&#x27;, the town&#x27;s first subdivision, and organized an association which provided running water to neighboring Sharkey County. Sanders was the first African-American in Mississippi to receive a master&#x27;s degree in educational administration.

During the Civil Rights Movement, Hollandale was noted for having passed an ordinance forbidding white civil rights workers from living with black citizens.

A marker on the Mississippi Blues Trail dedicated to musician Sam Chatmon is located in Hollandale, as is a marker on the Mississippi Country Music Trail dedicated to Ben Peters.

Hollandale resident Capt. Kermit O. Evans was recognized by the U.S. Congress in 2007 after losing his life in Operation Iraqi Freedom.

The Farm Fresh Catfish processing plant was located in Hollandale until it closed in 2004, laying off 240 workers. The Delta &amp; Pine Land Company of Mississippi, a cotton and soybean producer owned by Monsanto, continues to be a major employer.

A 2008 study by the University of North Carolina described Hollandale as &quot;a small community that has been mired in poverty for decades.&quot;

<text>Leland is a city in Washington County, Mississippi, United States. It is located within the Mississippi Delta, on the banks of Deer Creek. The population was 4,481 at the 2010 census. It was once a railway town and had long been a center of cotton culture, which is still an important commodity crop in the rural area. It was once considered the second-largest city in Washington County in 1920 due to its rapid growth of residents, businesses, and schools.

Since before the Civil War, farming has been the basis of the local economy. There are several privately owned farms within and around the boundaries of the town. Mississippi State University and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) maintain an agriculture research station at Stoneville on Leland&#x27;s outskirts. Other agricultural companies in the area are Lauren Farms BASF Stoneville Cotton, Bayer Crops Science, GreenPoint Ag, Azlin Seed Service, Corteva Agriscience, Pettiet Agricultural Services, Inc., Nutrien Ag Solutions, K-I Chemical U.S.A., Greenland Planting Company, Ayers-Delta Implement, Edward&#x27;s Flying Service, Essie Patterson Farm Trucking, and Southern Seed Association. Cotton, soybeans, rice and corn are the leading commodity crops along with catfish.

A number of national and regionally noted blues musicians are from Leland. There are five Mississippi Blues Trail markers in Leland commemorating the small town&#x27;s significant contribution to blues history. Highway 61, mentioned in numerous blues recordings, runs through the town and gives its name to the community&#x27;s blues museum. Leland is the burial place of the folk artist and blues musician James &quot;Son&quot; Thomas, who lived for many years near the railroad tracks. Thomas is buried beneath a gravestone donated by Mt. Zion Memorial Fund, to which musician John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival was a yearly contributor.

Blues musician Johnny Winter spent part of his childhood in Leland. Winter&#x27;s grandfather and father, a former mayor of Leland, operated J.D. Winter &amp; Sons, a cotton business. One of the Blues Trail markers in Leland is dedicated to Winter.

The community is the childhood home of puppeteer Jim Henson, who was born in nearby Greenville, but raised in Leland. Here he created the character of Kermit the Frog, a Muppet. The city has a museum along the banks of Deer Creek celebrating Henson&#x27;s accomplishments called the Jim Henson Exhibit.

Leland was selected as the site for the Mississippi Wildlife Heritage Museum, opened in 2016.

==History==
=== 1800–1900: Founding ===
The area in which Leland sits was once part of the Choctaw territory in the early 1800s. After the Second Choctaw Cession, which came from the Treaty of Doak&#x27;s Stand of 1820, the land was fought over by the United States government and the Choctaw Indians during the American Civil War in which the Choctaw Indians sided with the Confederacy in order to fight the Union for the return of their land.

The territory that the town was built on was first settled on in 1834 by Samuel and Susan Jones, Mary Neely, and Malinda Breeland. A few years later, they deeded the land to the families of Connerly and Buckner. They made their home on the bank of Deer Creek on the Three Oaks Plantation. Soon other settlers came to live in Leland and the Stoneville area. To travel between both places at the time, people used boats to navigate on Deer Creek. There was even a drawbridge that wad built by Leland settlers to be more closely connected with the people of Stoneville.

Years later, the Buckner and Connerly families moved away and sold their land to Judge James Ruckus and William Yerger. The new owners maintained the land until the American Civil War. In 1869, their heirs quit claimed the land for release mortgages which passed to the hands of the Bank of Kentucky. After seven years, Mississippi native Captain James Alexander Ventress Feltus (1840–1908) bought the 900 acres of land for $12,000.

Captain James A. V. Feltus built his home at the “Three Oaks” and deeded a 100-foot right-of-way on the land to the Memphis and Vicksburg Railroad Company; however, no railway was built until 1885, when the right of way was given to the Louisville, New Orleans and Texas Railroad Company. Leland was one of two cities considered for a terminus of several railroad lines, most notably, the Louisville, New Orleans &amp; Texas Railway. Captain John C. Calhoun, an enterprising and liberal owner of the Leland Plantation, pushed efforts to make Leland a primary candidate for the terminus.

Captain Feltus dedicated the original town of Leland by signing deeds that created streets from First to Eighth Streets, which included Main and Broad Streets as the east and west boundaries of the town. Accounts state that Captain Feltus named the town after Miss Leland McCutcheon, the mother of Feltus’ friend, Ruben Armstrong and fiancé of young traveling railroad auditor C. E. Armstrong. It would seem that both accounts state that both men asked Captain Feltus to name the town in her honor. The first store built in the town of Leland was the Greenley&#x27;s Mens Store, owned by J. C. Greenley.
In January 1886, the citizens of the town drafted a charter to incorporate the town of Leland and sent it by mail to the representatives at Jackson, Mississippi. By February of that year, the charter was amended in bills H.B. 642 and H.B. 643 and was well on its way to making the town officially recognized as a city; it was approved on February 20, 1886.
As the town continued to progress, it established its first newspaper publication, &quot;The Leland Record&quot;, and businesses were established, including retail, banks, law firms, other railway companies, grocers, innkeepers, landlords and more.

==History==
Like Winston County, Louisville is named for Louis Winston (1784–1824), a colonel in the militia, a prominent lawyer, and a judge of the Mississippi Supreme Court. In 1863 Union Colonel Benjamin Grierson marched 900 troops through Louisville during his raid through Mississippi. There was no fighting in Winston County.

In 1927, a mob of 1,000 white men from Louisville, lynched two African-Americans, Jim and Mark Fox by wrapping them in barbed wire and setting them on fire. The Foxes were accused of killing Clarence Nichols, a white man who started a fight with them because they would not let him pass their Ford touring car in his Chevrolet.

On April 28, 2014, Louisville was hit by an EF4 tornado, resulting in ten fatalities.

==Geography==
Louisville is located at (33.122931, -89.056182). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (1.44%) is water. It is known by many as the &quot;Front porch of the South&quot;.

There were 2,641 households, out of which 34.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 40.4% were married couples living together, 25.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 31.2% were non-families. 28.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.55 and the average family size was 3.12.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 28.9% under the age of 18, 9.3% from 18 to 24, 24.7% from 25 to 44, 19.8% from 45 to 64, and 17.3% who were 65 years of age or older.

==Education==
Prior to 1970, Louisville maintained a dual system of schools for White and Black students. Black students were educated at the Louisville Colored School, also known as Camile Street School, whereas White students had their own schools, including Louisville High School. Several federal laws and U.S. Supreme Court decisions forced this to change. In 1967, due to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the school adopted a desegregation plan that in theory allowed students to choose which schools to attend. When the courts mandated that the schools be integrated, students from Louisville Colored School were allowed to attend Louisville High School. In order to preserve a segregated education for White students only, a segregation academy, Winston Academy was created. The City of Louisville is now served by the Louisville Municipal School District and Louisville High School. Private schools in Louisville include Winston Academy, which as of 2020 was still over 99% white, and Grace Christian School.

==Culture==

The American Heritage &quot;Big Red&quot; Fire Museum is located in Louisville. This museum features a collection of restored antique fire equipment and fire engines. The Strand Theatre, in downtown Louisville, is an historic movie theater which now serves as an art and music venue. Louisville native Carl Jackson plays an annual Christmas concert at the theater to raise money for the building&#x27;s restoration.

==Transportation==
Mississippi Highway 14 enters east from the Alabama state line through Macon and when it enters in Louisville it is also known as Main Street. It leaves westbound eventually traveling to the Mississippi River where it ends.

Mississippi Highway 15 enters from the north from Ackerman, MS, then meets up with Mississippi Highway 25 just north of Louisville. M.S. 25 enters from the north from Starkville. M.S. 15 and 25 travel together along the western side of town. At the southern edge of town they separate: M.S. 15 traveling to Philadelphia &amp; Interstate 20; and M.S. 25 to Jackson.

<doc id="122474" wikidata="Q1807149" url="?curid=122474" title="Satartia, Mississippi">
<text>Satartia is a village in Yazoo County, Mississippi. Per the 2020 Census, the population was 41, Mississippi&#x27;s smallest incorporated municipality by population.

Located on the east bank of the Yazoo River, Satartia was once a thriving river port, and is one of the oldest non-Native settlements in Yazoo County.

==History==
Satartia is a Choctaw word meaning &quot;pumpkin place&quot;, likely due to the small gourds that grow in the area. In the early 1800s, Satartia was a busy shipping point from which cotton was transported by steamboat to New Orleans along the Yazoo River.

During the Civil War, General Grant sailed a gunboat from Vicksburg and captured the village; the Wilson House on Plum Street was used as his headquarters during the occupation. The war also produced the &quot;Satartia Rifles&quot;, of the 12th Mississippi Infantry Regiment, a well-regarded Confederate company and recruitment group.

In February 2020, a pressurized pipeline owned by Denbury Resources carrying liquid carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide ruptured &quot;less than half a mile&quot; from Satartia. First responders evacuated Satartia&#x27;s 42 residents, and approximately 250 others living near Satartia. In 2022, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration recommended a civil penalty of $3,866,734 against Denbury Resources.

<text>Yazoo City is the county seat of Yazoo County, Mississippi, United States. It was named after the Yazoo River, which, in turn was named by the French explorer Robert La Salle in 1682 as &quot;Rivière des Yazous&quot; in reference to the Yazoo tribe living near the river&#x27;s mouth. Yazoo City is the principal city of the Yazoo City Micropolitan Statistical Area, which is part of the larger Jackson–Yazoo City Combined Statistical Area. According to the 2010 census, the population was 11,403.

==History==

The community now known as Yazoo City was founded in 1824 with the name Hannan&#x27;s Bluff. It was later renamed Manchester, then changed to Yazoo City in 1841. Yazoo City became the county seat in 1849. A yellow fever epidemic struck Yazoo City in 1853.

During the American Civil War, the Confederate ironclad CSS &quot;Arkansas&quot; was completed at a makeshift shipyard in Yazoo City after the Confederate loss of New Orleans and Memphis. During her short career, the &quot;Arkansas&quot; challenged the Union navy&#x27;s control of the Mississippi River and helped avert the early fall of Vicksburg. On May 21, 1863, as a Union fleet steamed up the Yazoo River, the Confederate forces burned down the shipyard to keep their foes from capturing the vessels being built there. The Federal forces then burned down the sawmill and lumberyard before withdrawing. After their capture of Vicksburg in July 1863, another Union raid briefly occupied Yazoo City, but this time the Union ironclad USS &quot;Baron DeKalb&quot; was sunk by a mine. Federal troops occupied the town in September and again in October 1863. Another occupation resulted in the Battle of Yazoo City on March 5, 1864 between the Union troops and Confederates led by Robert V. Richardson and Lawrence Sullivan Ross. The Union troops held their ground but departed the following day. The Federal forces returned again on May 19, 1864, doing more damage to the town.

Yazoo City was rebuilt, but yellow fever struck and took more victims in 1878. On May 25, 1904, a fire destroyed much of central Yazoo City. According to a local legend, the fire was caused by a witch avenging her death. In reality, a boy playing with matches accidentally set a house ablaze. The fire quickly spread, and three-fourths of the town was destroyed, including most of the homes. It was stopped by a canal, which saved the new courthouse (built in 1872 to replace the one burned by the Union forces) and 10 antebellum homes nearby. The town took almost two years to recover.

In 1915, the Orr Modern Motor Car Company was founded in Yazoo City by G.A. Wilson and C.D. Orr, with capital of $2,000,000 (). Despite its name, the company was focused just on making Orr&#x27;s innovative worm drive and assembled only one automobile as a prototype. Not long after, Orr shut its doors.

The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 did much damage to the entire Delta, but Yazoo City was restored and is now protected by an effective flood-prevention system.

===Tornado History===

A strong tornado, rated EF4 on the Enhanced Fujita scale and with a path width of , hit Yazoo County on April 24, 2010. Four people were killed in the Yazoo City area, and a number were seriously injured; four of the victims were airlifted to the University of Mississippi Medical Center in the capital city of Jackson, away. The Governor of Mississippi, Haley Barbour, toured the area in a National Guard helicopter and held a news conference on the disaster at 3:30 pm. The tornado and the aftermath were shown in an episode of the Discovery Channel series &quot;Storm Chasers&quot;, and several YouTube videos show considerable detail and descriptions.

On November 29, 2010 around 8:05 pm local time, Yazoo City was struck by two EF2 tornadoes: the first one tracked southwest of town. The second went right through downtown causing significant damage to several buildings.

A high-end EF1 tornado passed through the southeast side of the city on May 2, 2021. Multiple mobile homes were destroyed and trees, power lines, and homes were damaged.

==Geography==

Yazoo City is located northwest of Jackson at the junctions of U.S. Routes 49, 49E, and 49W, and MS Highways 3, 16, and 149, on the banks of the Yazoo River, near the Panther Swamp National Wildlife Refuge.

U.S. Route 49W provides a fairly direct link between Yazoo City and Belzoni. The old highway segment, renamed Mississippi Highway 149, passes through Panther Swamp National Wildlife Refuge and the communities of Louise and Midnight before reconnecting with the new US 49W at Silver City, south of Belzoni. The new highway makes the town of Carter so near, it might be considered for annexation by Yazoo City. Two bridges now cross the Yazoo River at Yazoo City.

The section of MS 3 in Yazoo City is called Haley Barbour Parkway. Barbour, the former governor of Mississippi, grew up in Yazoo City and has a home on Wolf Lake, a lake north of Yazoo City. U.S. Route 49 (part of which was formerly U.S. 49E) through Yazoo City is named Jerry Clower Boulevard, after the famous comedian, a former resident of Yazoo City.

Yazoo City is also known as the &quot;Gateway to the Delta&quot; due to its location on the transition between the two great landforms that characterize the geography of Mississippi (the western part of the city lies in the Mississippi Delta and the eastern part lies in the loess bluffs that characterize most of eastern Mississippi).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (1.19%) is covered by water.

<text>Brashear is a city in Salt River Township, Adair County, Missouri, United States. The population was 273 at the 2010 census.

==History==

The town of Brashear was laid out in 1872. It was named after Richard Matson Brashear (1846-1933), who was a prominent farmer and businessman in the area. Richard Matson Brashear was the son of William Gowan Brashear (1807-1862), who is said to have been one of the first white settlers in the area in 1842. However, the Brashear community dates back prior to 1872 by several years. Approximately one mile north of the current location, there once stood a prosperous small village named Paulville, also known as Paultown, which was established around 1855 by a man named Walker Paul (1816-1888). Paulville served as a trading hub for the farms of eastern Adair County, along with several other businesses, one of which was a grist mill. Sometime during the Civil War, the grist mill was put to the torch to prevent Confederate recruits from being resupplied. The coming of the Quincy, Missouri &amp; Pacific Railroad in 1872 saw a wholesale population shift. The building of a rail depot at the newly platted town of Brashear caused a very large portion of Paulville&#x27;s population and business to migrate the short distance south. Through the latter half of the 19th century and first few decades of the 20th, Brashear&#x27;s business district ebbed and flowed. Similarly, the Great Depression and post-World War Two mobility of the American public led to many changes. In 1950 Brashear had a population of only 152, however that number has been on a slight rise ever since. A few business concerns remain today, but most residents travel west to Kirksville or east to Edina for their shopping and employment.

==Geography==
Brashear is located on Missouri Route 6 3.5 miles west of Hurdland and 13 miles east-southeast of Kirksville. The community lies on Hog Branch one mile east of the North Fork of the Salt River.

By 1917 three years of high school credit could be obtained, and by 1922 Brashear was an accredited four-year high school. In 1925 the first Brashear High School was destroyed by fire, but quickly rebuilt. By January 1965 all surrounding rural schools had been consolidated into the current R-2 District. 
Not long after the destruction of the first high school, a northern Missouri legend was born: the annual Brashear Basketball Tournament. The year 1918 saw the birth of organized school basketball at Brashear, and by 1927 the first tournament was held. Through good times and bad the tournament has persevered to become one of the oldest in Missouri. The Brashear Lady Tigers won back-to-back Missouri Class 1A state basketball titles in 2003 and 2004. On June 3, 2010 the Brashear Tigers baseball team competed in the Missouri Class 1A baseball championship game, taking second place. Brashear is a charter member of the Tri-County Conference in athletics, academics, and music.

<text>Gibbs is a village in Wilson Township, Adair County, Missouri, United States. The population was 107 at the 2010 census.

== History ==

The town of Gibbs was an outgrowth of the Santa Fe Railroad, laid out in 1887 when the rail lines passed through southeastern Adair County. The name Gibbs was chosen in honor of Frank W. Gibbs, who donated land to the Santa Fe Railroad for the construction of a rail depot and stockyard. At the time of Gibbs&#x27; incorporation in 1894, it was anticipated that the town might become Adair County&#x27;s main rail shipping point for the Santa Fe. This hope was bolstered by the fact that the road leading to Gibbs was the first all-weather road in the county. In the late 1800s a considerable amount of cattle and hogs were shipped from the Gibbs depot to packing houses in Chicago, along with seasonal carloads of fresh apples, strawberries, and eggs to points across America. Perrin &amp; Company of Chicago also constructed a grain elevator trackside for the storage and shipping of corn, with lesser amounts of barley, oats, and wheat. The addition of a second Santa Fe trackline next to the existing one in 1908 added to Gibbs residents hopes for a bright future.
However, the majority of merchants and businesses of Kirksville, the county&#x27;s major trading hub, instead chose to use La Plata, on the Macon-Adair County border, as their major shipping and passenger service outlet on the Santa Fe. A US Post Office was established in 1887, and several businesses could be found including a barber shop, several general merchants, and two blacksmiths. The Gibbs business district also had of two hotels, an opera house, a bank, lumberyard, undertaker service, a cement factory, and the aforementioned grain elevator. The Bank Of Gibbs was founded in 1898 and served the citizens of Gibbs, Adair County, and northern Macon county well. It closed in 1933. For a time at the turn-of-the-century Gibbs had its own newspaper, &quot;Gibbs Telegraph&quot;. Gibbs featured four churches, but a falling population led to the closing of the last one in the early 1980s. The last Gibbs business, a grocery store, closed in 1970. It was also in that year that a rural health clinic, established by a Kirksville hospital in 1949, closed. The Santa Fe rail depot was closed in the 1960s and the two-room school was consolidated into the Brashear (Adair County R-2) school system in 1966.
It is now primarily a &#x27;bedroom community&#x27; with most residents traveling to cities like Kirksville and Macon for employment. A 2007 rental dispute between the US Postal Service and the buildings owners has led to the closing, at least temporarily, of the Gibbs post office.

<text>Kirksville is the county seat of and most populous city in Adair County, Missouri, United States. Located in Benton Township, its population was 17,530 at the 2020 census. Kirksville is home to three colleges: Truman State University, Moberly Area Community College, and A.T. Still University.

== History ==

Kirksville was laid out in 1841 on a site, and was first incorporated in 1857.

===Origin of name===
According to tradition Jesse Kirk, Kirksville&#x27;s first postmaster, shared a dinner of turkey and whiskey with surveyors working in the area on the condition that they would name the town after him. Not only the first postmaster, Kirk was also the first to own a hotel and a tavern in Kirksville.

Contrary to popular belief, the name of the city has no connection to John Kirk, onetime president of Truman State University from 1899 to 1925. However, the grandson of Jesse Kirk reported that the town was named for Kirk&#x27;s son John, a figure of local legend credited with killing two deer with a single bullet. &quot;Hopkinsville&quot; was explained as a joking reference to the peculiar gait of John Kirk&#x27;s lame father-in-law, David Sloan; the jocular name was discarded when the village was selected for the seat of justice in Adair County.

===Battle of Kirksville===
The Battle of Kirksville was fought August 6–9, 1862, during the American Civil War. Union troops led by John McNeil forced Confederate volunteers under Joseph Porter to vacate the city. Casualty estimates (almost entirely Confederate) range from 150-200 dead and up to 400 wounded. According to the August 12, 1862, &quot;Quincy Herald&quot; there were 8 Federal dead and 25 wounded. The victorious Union commander, Colonel McNeil, gained brief national attention for his post-battle execution of a small number of Confederate prisoners. These prisoners had been previously captured in battle and then paroled with the understanding they would no longer take up arms against the Union, upon penalty of death if recaptured. Nonetheless, Confederate government officials were outraged, and it is said that Confederate president Jefferson Davis even called for the execution of Colonel (later Brigadier General) McNeil if he were to be captured.

===Tornadoes===
On the evening of April 27, 1899, an F4 tornado passing through Adair County cut a path of destruction three blocks wide, killed 34 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings. The popular song &quot;Just as the Storm Passed O&#x27;er&quot; was based on the event, and the Kimball Piano Company exploited the incident for its advertising, when one of their instruments was carried a long distance by the tornado but still found in working condition.

On May 13, 2009, Kirksville was again the victim of a large tornado. An EF2 tornado struck the northern edge of Kirksville destroying or severely damaging many homes, several businesses, a car dealership, and at least one factory. Two residents living just outside the city limits were killed by the tornado, and as many as a dozen other area residents were injured. The story and extensive video of the 2009 twister was featured in season 3, episode 4 of &quot;Storm Chasers&quot; on the Discovery Channel as well as a 2010 episode of &quot;Storm Stories&quot; on The Weather Channel.

===National Register of Historic Places===

Harris House, Journal Printing Company Building, Kirksville Courthouse Square Historic District, Drs. George and Blanche Laughlin House, Masonic Temple, Dr. E. Sanborn Smith House, Orie J.

===Congolese population===
By 2015 a number of persons originating from the Democratic Republic of the Congo settled in Kirksville; they first came to the U.S. through diversity visas. Many found work at a Farmland Foods facility in nearby Milan, Missouri. In 2014 five Congolese families lived in Kirksville. By February 2016 almost 40 Congolese families resided in Kirksville, totaling around 100 people.

Prior to 2015 about half of the 20-25 English as a second language program students in the Kirksville R-III School District were of Hispanic origin, but the wave of Congolese students appeared by 2015, doubling the number of ESOL students and giving it a French-speaking population not previously present. Therefore, the district began expanding its ESOL program.

Students and faculty from Truman State University took steps to help the Congolese residents acclimate to life in Kirksville.

According to Sana Camara of Truman State, many of the immigrants were well-educated, and that the main barrier to success was specifically a lack of English knowledge.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

====Transit====
Kirksville is served by Kirk-Tran, which provides residents with a deviated fixed-route transit system and demand response service. The deviated fixed-route bus service is a single loop route operating hourly from 7:00am to 6:00pm Monday-Thursday, 7:00am to 9:00pm on Fridays and 9:00am to 9:00pm on Saturdays. There is no service on Sundays.

====Railroads====

Kirksville, by way of La Plata, is serviced by Amtrak&#x27;s Southwest Chief which runs along the BNSF Railway. The distance from Truman State University to La Plata (Amtrak station) is approximately .

Kirksville once had two operational railroads that ran through town. The east-west rail line was originally incorporated as the Quincy, Missouri &amp; Pacific Railroad, which was renamed several times during financial restructuring and changing hands numerous times, until in 1897 it became the Quincy, Omaha &amp; Kansas City Railroad. Financial problems continued, and it was operated by the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad after 1903 and later absorbed by that company, which in turn became Burlington Northern in 1970. The portion of the line that ran west of Kirksville towards Green City was abandoned and eventually torn down in the early 1950s. The portion of the line that ran east of town towards Edina, Labelle, and West Quincy was scrapped in 1982–1983, after the Staggers Rail Act deregulated the rail industry. The depot which serviced along the Burlington Northern in Kirksville still stands along Elson Street just north of Cottonwood Street and plans are that it will be renovated.

Kirksville&#x27;s other railroad, the Wabash Railroad, became the Norfolk and Western Railway in October, 1964. This north-south line later became the Norfolk Southern Railway in 1982 after N&amp;W merged with Southern Railway. In April 1992, the last official NS train ran the line between Albia, IA and Moberly, MO as the railroad announced it would abandon the line due to a loss in profit. During the summer of 1993, the railroad reopened to train traffic as the floods of the midwest affected lines around the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Trains continued to run the line until 1995. After failed attempts from buyers wanting to purchase the line and turn it into a shortline railroad, work began on tearing down the railroad from Moberly, MO northward toward La Plata, MO where it has a connection with the BNSF Railway and from Moulton, IA southward toward La Plata, MO. The portion of the line from Moulton, IA northward towards Albia was purchased by the Appanoose County Community Railroad. In late September 1997, the tracks through Kirksville were finally torn out, leaving the city without a rail line. The project to tear out the abandoned line was completed by the end of 1997.

====Aviation====

The City of Kirksville operates the Kirksville Regional Airport (formerly Clarence Cannon Airport), four miles (6 km) south of the city by the village of Millard.

In 1952, the United States Air Force opened a radar base that was home to the 790th Radar Squadron, an Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron, in Sublette, about north of Kirksville. The Air Force inactivated the 790th Radar Squadron in 1968. The Federal Aviation Administration took over running the radar and most of the surrounding were given to Northeast Missouri State University. The current radar, an Air Route Surveillance Radar - Model 3, is a long-range radar that feeds data to air traffic control centers that control aircraft flying over the region.

Four fatal airplane accidents have occurred near Kirksville:
#On May 6, 1935, TWA Flight 6, carrying Senator Bronson Cutting of New Mexico, crashed south of Kirksville, killing him and four others. As a result, Congress created the Civil Aeronautics Administration.
#On May 22, 1962, Continental Airlines Flight 11, heading to Kansas City from Chicago under heavy weather, was brought down by a dynamite explosion northwest of Kirksville. Some aviation historians consider this the first act of aviation terrorism in history.
#On October 20, 2004, Corporate Airlines Flight 5966 (now RegionsAir) crashed just south of Kirksville Regional Airport, killing 13 of 15 passengers and crew.
#On November 5, 2013, a Piper PA-32 crashed 3 miles southeast of Kirksville Regional Airport on its final approach, killing both passengers aboard.

===Utilities===
Kirksville is served by two watersheds. Hazel Creek Lake (530 acres), formed in 1982, was first used as a water source the next year. The larger water source, Forrest Lake (640 acres), was formed by the city in the 1950s when a dam was constructed across Big Creek. Forrest Lake anchors the Thousand Hills State Park, located just west of the city and is named in honor of former Missouri Governor Forrest Smith.

Kirksville trash pick-up is currently conducted through the Advanced Disposal of Macon, MO. The company also picks up recycling and yard waste for the city. Most residents receive electrical service from AmerenUE, although a portion of the city receives it from Tri-County Electric, an R.E.C. co-op. Liberty Utilities is the natural gas supplier for the Kirksville area.

<text>Novinger is a town in Nineveh Township, Adair County, Missouri, United States. The population was 456 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Key events in Novinger history include the arrival of the Quincy, Missouri &amp; Pacific railroad and filing of the town plat by founder John C. Novinger in 1878, the establishment of a U.S. Post Office the next year, and the first shaft coal mine in 1883. A turn-of-the-century coal mining boom saw Welsh, Germans, Scots-Irish, Italians, natives of the Balkan countries and many others and their families immigrate from all over the world. It was this boom that finally saw Novinger incorporated as a city in 1901 as the population swelled into the thousands. However, the Great Depression, a post-World War II switch to mostly natural gas and electric heat in American homes, and heavy industry&#x27;s lessening coal use doomed the area coal fields. The railroads had pulled out by 1950, and the last mine, Billy Creek Coal Mine southwest of Novinger, closed in January 1966. At the time of its closing Billy Creek was the last operating deep shaft mine in Missouri.
Novinger versus Nature: Being a river town, Novinger was no stranger to frequent flooding of the Chariton River during the community&#x27;s early years. However a channelization of the Chariton by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the 1950s alleviated much of the threat. But in June 2008 a series of heavy rains led to flooding of the Chariton, and more significantly, let flash flood waters of Spring Creek and Davis Creek to back up from the river into Novinger. Several homes in the low-lying southwestern part of town were heavily damaged, as was the historic 1800s log homestead and Novinger Community Center. On May 13, 2009 a large tornado, estimated as a strong EF2 on the Enhanced Fujita scale, struck the southern edge of Novinger. At least six homes were destroyed, along with two brick buildings in the business district. The tornado caused moderate-to-severe damage to over fifty homes and businesses. Fortunately only minor injuries to residents were reported. Additionally, other homes and barns were also badly damaged or destroyed in rural Adair County southwest of Novinger. Adding insult to injury two days later on May 15 heavy rains once again caused severe flash flooding to Novinger&#x27;s low-lying areas, including once again the Novinger Community Center and log homestead -— both of which had only recently been repaired from damage suffered in the June 2008 flood. The combination of tornado and flood forced the first-ever cancellation of Novingers annual Coal Miner Days celebration as well as postponement of graduation ceremonies at Novinger R-1 High School.

Late on the night of September 11, 2010 a major fire swept through the Novinger business district. Five buildings, including the former city hall and senior citizen center were destroyed, as well as two businesses.

===Novinger today===
The Novinger business community is but a fraction of its size during the coal boom days. The town proper and surrounding area offer two beauty salons, two construction companies, two convenience stores, a catering business, farm supply store, heating and cooling repair, and auction service. Most Novinger residents however must travel to the larger city of Kirksville to the east or Milan to the west for employment, thus making Novinger largely a bedroom community.

Education for the town, and much of western Adair County, is provided by the Adair County R-1 school district. The school facility is located on Missouri Highway 149 in Novinger. Recent improvements to the town include storm warning capability, upgraded water system, and upgrades to the community center and community fairgrounds. In 2011 an outdoor basketball court was constructed with the assistance of Toolbox Ministries, a traveling Christian-based community betterment organization. Fire protection for the community is provided by a well-equipped volunteer fire department. At various times Novinger has employed a town marshal, but the majority of law enforcement protection comes from the county sheriff&#x27;s department and state patrol.

Recreation activities include deer and turkey hunting, along with fishing in the nearby lakes, ponds and the Chariton River, boating and waterskiing at Thousand Hills State Park, four miles east of Novinger.

<text>Rock Port is a city in, and the county seat of, Atchison County, Missouri, United States. The population was 1,278 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Rock Port was laid out in 1851. The city, which is eight miles east of the Missouri River in the Loess Hills bluffs above the river, derives its name from Rock Creek, which flows through it. Following the Honey War border dispute with Iowa when Missouri&#x27;s northern border was shifted farther south, the original county seat was moved from Linden to Rock Port.

The original city is located just east of I-29, but there is an additional travel hub closer to the interstate; truck stops, motels, fast food restaurants and fireworks stands host a large number of daytime visitors, despite the city&#x27;s small size.

The city of Rock Port has become largely energy self-sufficient. In April 2008, Rock Port claimed to be the first community in the United States to have its electricity 100 percent generated by wind power. Rock Port, which uses about 13 million kWh a year, has its power generated by the Loess Hills Wind Farm. The farm has four Suzlon 1.25-megawatt wind turbines. Excess power is sold to the Missouri Public Utility Alliance in Columbia, Missouri. The idea for the wind turbines came from the town&#x27;s former mortuary worker, Eric Chamberlain. The farm was built by Wind Capital Group and is by far the company&#x27;s smallest wind farm developed through January 2009. Wind Capital in 2008 built the bigger 50.4MW Cow Branch Wind Farm between Rock Port and Tarkio.

The Atchison County Memorial Building and John Dickinson Dopf Mansion are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Geography==

Rock Port is located along Rock Creek approximately 2.5 miles east of the Missouri River Valley.

Starting with a single ox and plow, Rankin enlarged his farm to over of land, 12,000 head of cattle, and 25,000 hogs in Northwest Missouri. By using the latest tools and technology, Rankin was able to raise a crop of 1,000,000 bushels of corn in a single year. Rankin Hall, a building on the former Tarkio College campus, was named for the Rankin family.

<text>Mexico, formerly known as New Mexico, is a city in and the county seat of Audrain County, Missouri, United States. It is home to the Missouri Military Academy and annually hosts the Miss Missouri Pageant. The city&#x27;s population was 11,469 at the 2020 census. The micropolitan statistical area consists of Audrain County. It is a part of the Columbia, Missouri metropolitan area.

==History==
Mexico was laid out as &quot;New Mexico&quot; in 1836 and was a major stop for settlers heading to the Republic of Texas (thus the name &quot;New Mexico&quot;), and it became the county seat under its present name in 1837. The word &quot;New&quot; was dropped after the Mexican War that saw Texas become a part of the United States.

There is an apocryphal story about the name. When a University of Missouri student, who was questioned on radio, was unable to give an account of her hometown&#x27;s name, the question was put to L. Mitchell White, then editor and publisher of the Mexico Ledger: &quot;&#x27;The first settlers found a wooden sign along the trail. It pointed southwest, and on it had been painted &quot;Mexico&quot;.&#x27;&quot; To avoid unnecessary labor, the sign was left in place. &quot;It was easier to call their town &#x27;Mexico&#x27; than to take down the old sign.&quot;

Mexico was incorporated as a town in 1855, was served by the Wabash Railroad in 1858 and by the Alton Railroad in 1872, and was first chartered as a city in 1874. The city is in the bluegrass region of Missouri, and was a shipping point for horses and mules. Mexico was a onetime major source for the nation&#x27;s fire brick production, so much so that it adopted the moniker &quot;Fire Brick Capital of the World&quot;. Bricks produced in Mexico were used in the construction of the NASA rocket launch site in Cape Canaveral. The industry fell on hard times and both major refractory plants in the area closed in 2002. There is no active quarrying for clay used in fire brick or refractories production in the area.

Mexico is located in the central region of Missouri known as &quot;Little Dixie,&quot; so named because of the settlement of the region by whites from border south states, intent on reproducing the ways and means of the Deep South. Over half of the enslaved population of Missouri was concentrated in Little Dixie counties, and was the epicenter to much of Missouri&#x27;s racist violence in the 19th and 20th centuries. Mexico competed with other MO cities for the title, &quot;Capital of Little Dixie.&quot;

The historic downtown square, with the typical courthouse as the focal point, is surrounded by dozens of multi-story brick buildings—some dating to the founding of the community. There are, of course, other historic spots including Simmons Stables and Graceland. In the late 1970s, Mexico began ripping up crumbling sidewalks of the downtown square and installing red paver bricks accented with turn-of-the-century lamp posts and park benches. In the 1980s, Mexico was one of six nationwide finalists for Saturn&#x27;s new U.S. auto plant. It lost to Spring Hill, Tennessee because Mexico was not served by a four-lane freeway. So as not to lose future development, Mexico officials quickly lobbied state and federal officials to secure funding for a new four-lane divided highway (U.S. Route 54) which now serves the community from Interstate 70. Formerly known as the &quot;Saddle Horse Capital of the World,&quot; Mexico still hosts Hollywood celebrities and other visitors from around the world who come to purchase riding horses. The Simmons Stables, currently being revitalized, are now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Audrain County Courthouse, Ross House, and Arthur Simmons Stables Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Mexico was the location of Hardin College and Conservatory of Music, a Baptist college established in 1873 for young women, an institution founded and endowed by Charles H. Hardin, governor of the state from 1872 to 1874. It closed during the Great Depression and never reopened. Its 1,200-seat auditorium has been painstakingly restored and is now used for community theater and concerts. The remainder of the college houses the Mexico Public Schools administrative offices on South Jefferson Street. Its mascot is a bulldog.

== History ==
Exeter was platted in 1880. The city was named after Exeter in Devon, England.

The Frisco rail line ran through much of the Ozarks, including Exeter, bringing in tourists on their way to resorts, such as Mineral Springs. In 1896, the shortest railway in the country was built to connect Exeter and Cassville. It served as the main way into Cassville during the harsh winters that made many roads impassable. The rail-line was named &quot;The Cassville and Western Railroad.&quot; Because the railway ran only 4.8 miles one-way, the railway had to rely on steam power to travel uphill back to Exeter. Since Exeter is the highest point in the county, it was able to use gravity to coast back downhill to Cassville During its economic height, a hotel called The Palace was also built in Exeter as well as a flour mill. A massive fire broke out and burned the downtown on Oct. 21st, 1927. The railroad went bankrupt in 1956. In the 1950s, there was an Exeter&#x27;s Farmer Exchange, a market, and a post office. The post office has been in operation at Exeter since 1880.

Notable people born in Exeter include Major League baseball player Ed Hawk and professional bull rider Mason Lowe. The Exeter High School Boys Basketball team won the state championship in 1963. The Exeter High School Girls Basketball team won the state championship in 2009 and finished second in 2011. The Exeter High school won District first time in program in 23-24 spring season for Baseball

<doc id="122506" wikidata="Q967852" url="?curid=122506" title="Seligman, Missouri">
<text>Seligman is a city in Sugar Creek Township, Barry County, Missouri, United States. The population was 851 at the 2010 census. The town is named after Joseph Seligman, a prominent 19th-century businessman. The name Seligman (זעליגמאן, זעליקמאן) is of Yiddish derivation and means &quot;a jolly, cheerful person&quot;.

==Geography==
Seligman is located in the Ozarks and is, bordered by the Mark Twain National Forest to the east. The town is located on a ridge along Missouri Route 37. Rainfall west of the railroad flows into the Grand Lake o&#x27; the Cherokees by way of Big Sugar Creek and Cowskin River. Rainfall to the east of Seligman flows to Table Rock Lake by way of Dry Hollow, Blockade Hollow, and Butler Hollow. The region also hosts Karst topography, characterized by high limestone content and the formation of sinkholes and caves.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==History==
===Before the Louisiana Purchase===
During French exploration, what was to become Seligman was in the heart of the Osage Nation. The French claimed it as part of the Illinois Country, selling it to the United States as part of the Louisiana Purchase. Osage claims were ceded by the Treaty of Fort Clark, which was ratified in 1810.

===Early settlers===
Seligman originally developed from a small trading post that built up around or near the homestead of Andrew, George, John, Joshua and Jacob Roller from Scott County, Virginia, some of the first permanent European settlers to arrive in the area in the 1830s. At that time the region was a rough-hewn wilderness covered with large timber.

In May 1841, the county court approved construction of the first road through the territory, known today as Old Wire Road. This road originally was a trace cut by hundreds of Cherokee in 1838 as they wound their way across Missouri to Tahlequah, Oklahoma as part of the federal government&#x27;s Indian Removal Act of 1830 or &quot;Trail of Tears&quot;, which passed about five miles west of the Roller homestead. Shortly thereafter, a telegraph line was built which followed this trail, and Old Wire Road was built following the telegraph line.

By 1848 the Butterfield Stage Coach had established a route through the area from St. Louis, Missouri to Fayetteville, Arkansas, and brought even more settlers into the area. By the 1860s, the site had developed into a trading post called &quot;Roller&#x27;s Ridge&quot;, though the earliest original name of the community may have been &quot;Herdsville,&quot; named after Adam Herd or Hurd, who was also an early pioneer.

Education and religion were avidly important to the early settlers. Two schools were built in the area for local children, one north of town about which little is known, and one south of town called &quot;Red Chink&quot;, named for the red clay that was used to finish the log construction. These were both subscription schools, a common practice in which each child paid the teacher a dollar a month. School terms were only six months long, but sometimes semesters were extended if enough students enrolled. A Baptist church was also constructed on the outskirts of town, but few records remain.

===Civil War===
During the Civil War development mostly ceased as the region was thrown into turmoil and became increasingly lawless. Bushwhackers attacked townspeople in their homes, robbing them of gold, silver, food and supplies. Some bushwhackers were supported by the Union Army and encouraged to commit acts of terror and sabotage to undermine morale. Local government was apparently in disarray—county officials did not hold session from April 1861 to July 1864. During the war, General McCulloch, General Pearce, and General Price met at a private home in &quot;Roller&#x27;s Ridge&quot; to discuss the proposed site to wage battle at Cross Hollows in Benton County, Arkansas, before the Battle of Pea Ridge.

===Reconstruction===
After the war, development in &quot;Roller&#x27;s Ridge&quot; resumed and settlers continued to arrive. In 1866, Christian E. Fawver and his family came to the area from Illinois in a covered wagon and reopened Victory Mills, a gristmill on the upper arm of Big Sugar Creek north of town, and converted it to steam power. This became an important site for local residents. Before the mill opened, locals had to haul their grain to the site of the nearest railroad in Pierce City, Missouri —- a two-day trip. The population continued to grow, and on April 1, 1872, the U.S. Postal Department authorized the establishment of a post office to serve the community, designating it &quot;Herdsville&quot;. In 1876, another subscription school was built for the town&#x27;s children, a two-story building with a regular attendance of 40 students. A deep well was dug in the center of Main Street to supply the town&#x27;s needs, which was named the &quot;Exhaustable Fountain&quot; [sic], but because of the growing population, this well later went dry. Commerce increased, and in 1880 a dray service began operation in town, hauling and delivering freight by wagon with up to three teams of horses or mules. It also operated occasionally as a taxi service.

===Arrival of the railroad===
In 1880, the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad built a line from Pierce City to &quot;Herdsville&quot;. Arriving trains were loaded on a turntable and rotated manually to return to Pierce City. The company also gave of land for the purpose of building a town, and also designed its streets, complete with names. At this time, the town consisted of only one whiskey and drug store, and the population consisted mostly of railroad workers, but this store was later joined by a general store operated by Woodridge Anabel, and a hardware store operated by Drew Wilkerson.


In 1880 the town was platted, and on September 27 renamed Seligman in honor of Joseph Seligman, a wealthy railroad financier who had died the previous April. On March 8, 1881, the town was incorporated. In choosing the name Seligman, the residents recognized that the arrival of the railroad had been a great boon to the small settlement. Apparently as an act of gratitude, Mr. Seligman&#x27;s widow, Babet Seligman, gave the community $500 and one acre of land towards the building of a church. Together with $300 raised locally, Benjamin McCann constructed the Union Church in 1884. The church still stands and was in continuous use by various Protestant denominations from the time it was built until 1959.

Arriving trains soon brought a greater number and variety of visitors, traders and salesmen, and one of the first hotels, the Inmon House, was opened in 1881. By this time, the town had also grown to include a number of general merchandise stores, as well as a store for agricultural implements, a druggist, two hotels, a meat market, a livery stable, a granary, a lumber yard, a billiard hall, a barber shop, a blacksmith, a photographer, a physician, the Cross &amp; Diver of Eureka Stage Line, and seven saloons. In that year a town newspaper was established, the &quot;Seligman Sunbeam&quot;, whose motto was &quot;The Union, The Constitution, and The Enforcement of The Law&quot;. It was the first newspaper in the United States to endorse Grover Cleveland for the presidency.

In 1882, work began on what became in 1906 the Missouri and North Arkansas Railroad. This track went south and east of Seligman to, first, Eureka Springs and, ultimately, Helena, Arkansas. It poised Seligman toward greater growth and development, though the fare was $1.85 for eighteen miles —- a steep price at the time.

As many as six passenger trains passed through Seligman every day, and two of the hotels operating at the time, the Gladden and the Linden, had difficulty serving the large numbers of people who stopped to stay in town. Many of the travelers were salesmen, or &quot;drummers&quot; who would arrive with large trunks full of sample shoes, hardware, hats or costume jewelry and rent a buggy or dray wagon at the livery stable to transport their goods to outlying towns not connected to the railroad. Eventually six hotels opened in town at one point, which employed many local young people, especially women for cleaning, washing, filling water pitchers in each room, and cooking for boarders.

By this time, local industries included poultry farming as well as timbering and milling for production of railroad ties and whiskey kegs. Principal agricultural products included wheat, oats, corn, cattle and hogs, but residents also harvested peaches, apples, cantaloupe, strawberries, and spring water from Radium Springs. A 30-40 acre vineyard was also cultivated just east of Seligman, and the grapes were shipped to Springdale, Arkansas, to be processed into grape juice and wine.

===Setbacks===
A series of major fires had a disastrous impact on Seligman, beginning on January 22, 1883, when a fire broke out at the Exchange Hotel which destroyed it completely along with a large part of the town; W. J. Piper&#x27;s Witchita [sic] House Hotel, four saloons, a grocery, a meat market, a barber shop, a general store, the Seligman Hotel, a drug store, a bakery, a hardware and a shoe store, as well as the office of the &quot;Seligman Sunbeam&quot; went up in flames. Exactly two months later, the stables of the Seligman and Eureka Springs Stage Coach Company also burned down. Then, on January 13, 1884, another fire destroyed part of the remaining town.

Residents began rebuilding immediately, and in the process constructed Seligman&#x27;s first public school, a two-story frame building completed in circa 1892, replacing the subscription school.

===20th century===
In the early 1900s rebuilding continued, with many modern improvements. Southwestern Bell Telephone Company established an office in Seligman, in 1904 postal rural routes were established, in 1905 the Bank of Seligman was opened by C.C. Fawver, and in 1910 George Finn established the Farmers and Merchants Bank. Also in 1910, the North Arkansas line was extended from Seligman through Eureka Springs to Harrison, Arkansas. Two physicians set up practice in town, and one of them opened a four-room hospital. In 1912, the Sure Pop Oil Company attracted investors from Seligman and built an oil rig just across the border in nearby Gateway, Arkansas. In 1914, a tomato cannery was opened and operated by W.F. Turner, a vinegar factory was opened, and there was a brief attempt to mine silver in the town. Before Prohibition, some five saloons operated in Seligman, and it had a reputation as the &quot;wildest town in the west&quot;. Nevertheless, around this time Seligman was still just half as large as it had once been.

By the 1920s Seligman had been mostly rebuilt when another fire, the Christmas Fire of December 25, 1922, decimated the heart of the downtown. The Nesbitt Bros. Meat Market was destroyed along with a restaurant, the livery barn, the Gladden Hotel and Annex, the Frost Restaurant, the Northcutt Store, a drug store, a general store, and the Illinois Cafe.

After the Christmas Fire, the town struggled through most of the 20th century to recapture its former prosperity. This was made particularly difficult by the economic pressures of the Great Depression and the steady decline of passenger rail service through the area after World War II, which inevitably led to a contraction in the population of the town. The Missouri and Northern Arkansas Railroad ceased operation in 1958 after heavy rains washed out several bridges and a large section of track between Seligman and Beaver, Arkansas. Frisco&#x27;s passenger trains ceased their daily runs shortly thereafter. On March 9, 1966 the Frisco Station was demolished, a loss which saddened the community.

Seligman High School enrollment also began to decline after the war, and new state regulations required the formation of the Southwest R-5 School District to include outlying country districts. In 1954, the high school was relocated to Washburn, Missouri. When a heavy snow storm collapsed the roof of the Seligman Elementary School gymnasium on March 10, 1964, all Seligman students were relocated to a new building constructed in Washburn. What remained of the Seligman school was consumed by a fire in the late 1960s.

In the 1990s, Seligman began a series of civic development projects to improve infrastructure, which included the construction of a new city water tower and two city parks.

===21st century===
More recently, Seligman has continued civic development by establishing a community center, playground, public library, and the James L. Bottorff Memorial Museum, constructed as part of the Duane Corn Municipal Complex. A new fiber optic cable also now serves the area. In December 2014, Wal-Mart opened a neighborhood store in Seligman. Wal-Mart closed the store in August 2015 and remained vacant until August 2016 when Harp&#x27;s acquired the property.

==Notable visitors==
One story maintains that William Jennings Bryan, famous politician and devout prohibitionist, stopped in Seligman on a layover on his way to give a speech in Eureka Springs and spent some time in a Seligman saloon.

Around 1904, prohibitionist and reformer Carrie Nation visited Seligman on a tour, staying at the Linden Hotel. Although there was some concern about how far she would carry her campaign in a town full of saloons, she did not damage any property, but merely presented a female supporter with a tall-necked bottle with an inscription that read &quot;Oh Drink as Adam and Vote for Prohibition: Carry A Nation, Your Loving Home Defender.&quot;

In 1921, noted outlaw Henry Starr came into Seligman, took rooms at the Gladden Hotel, and charmed the proprietor into endorsing a check for $100. The next day, Starr entered the Seligman Bank and approached the teller with the check, which was immediately declined. Mr. Gladden himself stepped forward and informed the teller that the check was good, and even endorsed it. The next day, Starr and his cohorts robbed the bank of $1,200 at gunpoint. They then proceeded to rob a bank at Harrison, Arkansas, where Starr was shot and killed.

==Climate==
Seligman lies in the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), and experiences all four seasons, generally with hot, humid summers and cold winters, occasionally receiving cold air masses from the north. Seligman lies just east of the area known colloquially as &quot;Tornado Alley.&quot;

==Education==
Seligman is part of the Southwest R-5 School District. Primary and secondary students attend classes in nearby Washburn. The school team is known as &quot;The Trojans.&quot;

<text>Washburn is a city in Washburn Township, Barry County, Missouri, United States. The current town encompasses the sites of two communities formerly known as Keetsville and O&#x27;Day and is named for local pioneer Samuel C. Washburn. The population was 435 at the 2010 census.

==History==
===Keetsville 1850?–1868===
Located along the historic Trail of Tears and on the Old Wire Road, and was a Butterfield Overland Mail Route Flag Stop. Keetsville traced its official settlement to Georgia native John Cureton (1795-1853), who had served as a judge in Washington County, Arkansas before settling on the Washburn Prairie about two miles north of current day Washburn in 1840 and then procured the location of the town. In 1853, Cureton died and ownership of the land transferred to the Englishman James T. Keet (1818-1863), who then laid out the town of Keetsville. The 1850s saw the first real establishment of the town with Keet establishing a store at the site. The growth of the town would be interrupted by the Civil War, as a February 1862 skirmish, a predecessor to the much larger Battle of Pea Ridge the next month in Pea Ridge, Arkansas, would result in the destruction of the fledgling town. Following the war, the town was rebuilt between 1867 and 1869 and in 1868 it was renamed Washburn in honor of an early pioneer to the area Samuel Washburn, who had lived in the area about ten years, before moving to Texas where he was killed in 1838.

=== O’Day 1880–1892 ===
 In the winter of 1879 and 1880, the Atlantic and Pacific Railway — at that time a franchise of the St. Louis and San Francisco Railway — built a railroad line between Pierce City and Seligman, Missouri. This line ran about a half mile west of what was then Keetsville, but soon to be renamed Washburn. Instead of incorporating the Keetsville or Washburn name into the railroad stop at this location, the stop and the community that blossomed next to it was instead named O’Day, after the Irish-born John O’Day (1843-1901), a Springfield-based attorney for the railroad. In the years that followed O’Day grew, adding two hotels, shops, a newspaper, dwellings and in either 1887 or 1888 a post office, while also remaining codependent of neighboring Washburn concerning educational, religious and social life.

=== Washburn 1868–Present ===
The community of Washburn, formerly Keetsville, was officially incorporated as a town on August 4, 1880, though it is unclear if O’Day ever incorporated as a separate town. The two communities continued as separate entities through the 1880s and into the 1890s, when in 1892 the O’Day post office was disestablished and the Washburn post office took over for a newly consolidated community, a consolidation that was likely prompted by the building of a public school between the two communities.

===Commerce history===

Following the establishment of the railroad and the growth of the former O’Day community, many businesses were established in what is now Washburn. Among these were the O’Day House Hotel, Felker &amp; Johnson&#x27;s mercantile, the Pratt or Cunningham grocery store, J. M. Holton&#x27;s mercantile, Denbo&#x27;s grocery, the Brookshire &amp; Chandler drug store, and W. B. Adcock&#x27;s drug store. Many of these businesses had previously been located in the old Keetsville site, but moved to take advantage of the railroad. The &quot;O’Day Globe&quot; newspaper was founded in 1887. That same year, Irishman Timothy Patrick Mooney (1833-1912) moved his store and warehouse there from Washburn. In 1887 Reece Brothers built a large store and Postmaster James Buchanan Hurst (1859-1934) a post-office building.

In the original Keetsville location, Postmaster John O. Burton (1798-1852), John Cureton and Garrett Moore (1804-1870) had all established businesses before the war. J. W. Elliott was a silversmith in the 1870s and Blennerhassett &amp; Co. was a hardware store. By 1872, Washburn had 200 to 300 inhabitants, six general stores, three drug stores, a stove and tin store, three hotels, a boot shop, a jewelry store, and a school. In 1880, the same year as the establishment of O’Day, the population was 575. Among the businesses at that time were a nursery, multiple general stores and drug stores. Hotels operated by Mrs. A. Foster and T. P. Mooney. Flour and saw mills and multiple saloons were also in operation at this time. J. C. Thomas was the constable, William Keene Bayless (1850-1930) was the justice of the peace, William Rhoda Felker (1855-1929) was a real estate agent and J. W. Eggleston (1821-?), James Henry McDonald (1831-1917) and James T. Means (1824-1884) were physicians.

In addition to the &quot;O’Day Globe&quot;, several other newspapers were published in the Washburn area through the years, including &quot;Winger’s Journal&quot; in 1869, Professor White&#x27;s &quot;Gazette&quot; was published briefly and in 1911 &quot;The Washburn Review&quot; was printed for a short time.

==Public school system==
 Like most early communities in the Ozark Mountains, public education in Washburn likely started in private homes and churches. By 1888, the idea of a permanent public school district was largely settled and a vote on a bond issue that year resulted in the construction of a new brick school building on land between the town of Washburn and the community of O’Day. The site of that school building continues in use today as the campus of that school&#x27;s modern predecessor, the Southwest R-V School District. The building that the 1888 bond provided for would provide instruction for Washburn area students up until the eighth grade, though by 1920 it had expanded to offering high school classes.

In the early years of the school district there was no bus service, so children too far from the school to make it on foot on a daily basis attended various rural schools in the area, including Trents Creek, Maple Grove, Seven Star, Rock Springs, OK, Jacket and others. A tornado in the early 1920s destroyed the earlier building, so in 1924 a brick, single-story building was built to replace it. In the 1930s the Washburn School District instituted bus service, bringing high school students from the outlying communities into town for instruction beyond the eighth grade. This necessitated the addition of a second story to the 1924 structure as well as a gymnasium attached to the back of it. By 1954 the decision was made to close the Seligman School District in neighboring Seligman and bus those students to the larger Washburn campus. This consolidation resulted in the current Southwest R-V School District. Around this time the decision was also made to close the rural schools, most of them being antiquated in resources and limited in size, and use the bus service to bring the younger students to the former high school building in Seligman, while the Washburn building was then used exclusively as a high school. The Washburn building served as the high school and the Seligman building as the elementary for the next 10 years. Then on March 10, 1964, a heavy snowstorm cause the collapse of the Seligman elementary&#x27;s gymnasium roof. The residents of the school district then voted to build a new elementary school building in Washburn, alongside the 1924 high school building. The 12 classroom elementary building cost $260,000 and was dedicated on August 22, 1965. The new building included classrooms, a multipurpose room, a theater and a cafeteria. The decision to build the new elementary school in Washburn also spurred a short lived revolt against the school district by residents in Seligman, who were upset at losing the school. The residents formed their own unofficial Seligman common school district and sought a legal order to dissolve the Southwest R-V School District and divide the assets. This action was later dismissed.

On the morning of March 23, 1975, the 1924 high school building caught fire and burned to the ground. The school board quickly set up an election for April 17, 1975 to replace the building on a bond in excess of $200,000. The bond passed with more than the two-thirds majority needed and a new high school building was built and in service the following school year. By 1980 a separate middle school building had also been added to campus and in 1983 a new gymnasium was constructed; in 1982 the gymnasium that had been attached to the 1924 high school building was destroyed by fire. By the end of the 1990s increased enrollment, especially from the rural areas of the district, necessitated the need of a larger and more modern high school. With the construction and opening of this new high school building in the early 2000s, the 1975 high school building became the district&#x27;s new middle school building and elementary school students occupied both the 1981 middle school building and the 1965 elementary school building, which is currently the oldest building on a campus that dates its original educational origins to the 1888 bond issue.

==Washburn today==

Through much of the early 20th century Washburn prospered, but the increase in automobile ownership and the elimination of passenger rail service to the town in the 1950s eventually led to a major decrease in businesses and residents. The commercial district along Main Street, which was the heart of the former O’Day community, decayed through the second half of the 20th century, resulting in the destruction of much of the town&#x27;s historic core, including the razing of the original Atlantic and Pacific Railway train station in the 1960s.

Today the local school district is the town&#x27;s main employer. There is a bank, a farming supply business, a couple convenient/ gas stations and some smaller businesses that continue to operate in the town. These businesses are largely concentrated in the area of the original Keetsville plat and away from the area that had anchored the town for most of the last century. A handful of historic buildings do remain in downtown Washburn, including the lodge building and the W.B. Adcock&#x27;s drug store building, which at one time was used as the town&#x27;s community center and currently and now houses the town&#x27;s post office.

==Geography==

Another rumor for its naming stems from the Indian dig sites, early settlers thought the flint mines were Spanish gold mines. It was re-platted in 1870. The Golden City Herald served the community from 1881 until Dec. 28, 1972. Dellard Surbrugg published the newspaper and ran a commercial printing business from 1940 until he sold the paper to Gene Wotkiewicz, editor and publisher of the Lockwood Luminary.

<text>Liberal is a city in Barton County, Missouri, United States. The population was 629 at the 2020 census.

Liberal was founded as an atheist utopia in 1880 by lawyer George Walser, who named it after the Liberal League in nearby Lamar. The city had restrictions on both religious buildings and saloons, instead offering intellectual pursuits. A contingent of Christian residents moved to the town and began holding religious services against Walser&#x27;s wishes, and eventually took hold of the settlement.

==History==
Liberal was founded in 1880 by George Walser, an anti-religionist, agnostic lawyer and former state legislator who wished to create an atheist, &quot;freethinker&quot; utopia. It was named after the Liberal League in Lamar, Missouri, which Walser was a member of at the time. Walser purchased of land and advertised across the country for atheists to join his town, which would &quot;have neither God, Hell, Church, nor Saloon&quot;.

Walser organized a reformed school system that sought to promote liberal education free from the bias of Christian theology, and had instructional classes on Sundays to replace religious services. The Free Thought University was founded in 1886 with a staff of seven teachers providing regular lectures and hosting intellectual debates. The arrival of the railroad triggered a population boom, bringing the town to 546 residents by 1890.

Christian practitioners began arriving in Liberal soon after it was founded, but were initially met with resistance by Walser. They quietly bought homes within the town and began holding religious services, which were interrupted by Walser, and the Christian group later moved to nearby plots of land after being evicted. A new town, named Pedro, was established in 1884 by the Christians after Walser erected a barbed wire fence around Liberal. Walser eventually relaxed restrictions on saloons in 1887 and churches in 1889.

The local population peaked in the 1910s and declined for much of the 20th century. A major drought in 1980 triggered an exodus of businesses and residents. Today, Liberal is part of a solidly conservative electorate that encompasses all of Barton County.

<text>Butler is a city in Bates County, Missouri, United States and is part of the Kansas City metropolitan area. The population was 4,219 at the 2010 census. The county seat of Bates County, the city is named for William Orlando Butler, an American military and political figure of the early and mid-19th century. It is located approximately south of Kansas City, Missouri on U.S. Route 71-Interstate 49.

==History==
When laid out in April 1852, Butler was a short distance from its modern location, with John C. Kennett being recognized as the first settler to build a home. The plat for Butler was filed in August, 1853 and consisted of five lots on fifty-five acres of donated land. The first county seat for Bates County was Papinville.

After a large portion of the county was split off to form Vernon County in 1855, Papinville was no longer near the geographic center, and Butler was selected in 1856 as the county seat. County officials shortly thereafter selected the contracting firm of Fitzpatrick &amp; Hurt to construct a fifty-by-fifty foot brick courthouse at a cost of $5,000. This building served the county until being gutted by fire in 1861. The year 1856 also saw the establishment of Butler&#x27;s first general mercantile store was established in 1856, with several others following in the years prior to the Civil War&#x27;s outbreak in 1861.

===Civil War===
During the Civil War western Missouri was engulfed in insurgent Confederate actions and raids by Union forces. Personal conflicts were also played out in the war&#x27;s violence. Early in the conflict a major fire destroyed not only the Bates County courthouse but nearly all of the surrounding square of businesses and the town&#x27;s first church. The arson fire was the handiwork of a squad of volunteer Kansas cavalry acting on orders of Jayhawker Colonel James Montgomery. A company of pro-Confederate Missouri State Guard cavalry under Sidney D. Jackman arrived too late to stop the arson, but they pursued the Kansans back across the border, killing and wounding several. During much of the spring and summer of 1862, the town was occupied by Union Colonel Fitz Henry Warren and elements of the 1st Regiment Iowa Volunteer Cavalry. Arriving in April, they stayed until mid-August when they left for Clinton, Missouri, followed closely by Confederate troops under Colonel Jackman and General Vard Cockrell. The opposing groups would finally meet a few days later at the Battle of Lone Jack in Jackson county.
Two months later a Civil War milestone took place in Bates County at a site approximately eight miles southwest of Butler. This was the first combat against Confederates by African Americans fighting for the Union. During the Battle of Island Mound (aka &quot;Battle of Fort Toothman&quot;) on October 28–29, 1862, the Union 1st Kansas Colored Volunteers—composed of former slaves who had escaped from Arkansas and Missouri—and a scouting element from the 5th Kansas Volunteer Cavalry engaged a numerically superior force of Confederate guerrillas and recent Missouri State Guard recruits led by Vard Cockrell and Bill Truman (a relative of future President Harry S. Truman). The Union forces crossed into Missouri on a mission to clear Confederate guerrillas from an area known as &quot;Hog Island&quot;. The Union troops commandeered and fortified the homestead of Confederate guerrilla Enoch John Toothman. The next day a detachment engaged with mounted Confederate cavalry, but stood their ground. The Confederates withdrew from the area on October 29. Eight Union men and an estimated 30 to 40 Confederates were killed.

On August 25, 1863 Union Army General Thomas Ewing issued his controversial Order No. 11, requiring evacuation of all rural residents from the county. Ostensibly it was a response to the raid on Lawrence, Kansas by Confederate guerrillas under William Quantrill and a means to cut off materiel support for further bushwhacker activity. Opponents believed it was a personal vendetta by Ewing, an abolitionist from Kansas who lost several friends in the raid. Order No. 11 called for the forced evacuation of the rural residents of Bates and three other border counties (Cass, Jackson, and Vernon) within 15 days of issuance. All rural residents of the affected counties, regardless of their allegiance, were forced to leave their farms and homes.

Those who could prove their loyalty to the Union were allowed to remain in the counties but required to move to communities near Union military outposts. Those unwilling or unable to prove loyalty were ordered to move from the counties altogether or face imprisonment. Among the forced evacuees were Solomon and Hattie (Gregg) Young and their daughter Martha, the maternal grandparents and mother of future President Harry Truman. Butler was left a virtual ghost town. When residents returned later near war&#x27;s end, the town and much of the county as a whole had been burned, looted, and otherwise destroyed by regular Union forces, pro-Union Jayhawkers, and Kansas &quot;Red Legs&quot;.

===Post-Bellum=== 
A temporary structure for county business and court activities was constructed in late 1865 but proved inadequate. In 1869 a much larger two-story brick courthouse was constructed at a cost of $23,000. While slowly continuing its recovery, Butler was finally incorporated as a village on June 19, 1872. Seven years later, on April 7, 1879 Butler was reincorporated as a fourth-class city, with William Page serving as the first mayor. Numerous mills and grain elevators became part of the growing Butler business community through the 1870s, providing opportunities for surrounding farms to process wool and various grains.

Butler gained electric power in 1881, being one of the first communities west of the Mississippi River to offer that convenience. Four large lights were mounted atop the Bates County courthouse, providing illumination for the downtown area. Butler became known as &quot;The Electric City.&quot; The 1869 courthouse survived until 1899 when it was found to be structurally unsound; it was closed and demolished.

After passage of a bond issue, construction of the new Bates County Courthouse began in 1901. The eighty-by-one hundred five foot Romanesque-style structure was built of &quot;Carthage stone&quot; from southern Missouri at a total project cost of $50,000 and was occupied in July, 1902. By the early 20th century Butler&#x27;s business listings included three banks, an opera house, four hotels, and a large number of general and specialty stores.

In 2008 Bates county residents erected a statue and plaque honoring the 1st Kansas Colored Volunteers and the Battle of Island Mound on the grounds of the Bates County courthouse in Butler. The State of Missouri purchased a 40-acre property including part of the former Toothman homestead and established the &quot;Battle of Island Mound State Historic Site&quot; in October 2012.

The Bates County Courthouse and Palace Hotel are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==

===Hume area history prior to founding===
The Hume area prior to the founding of the town was an area bathed in the beauty of nature and heinous Border Wars. Native Americans are thought to have buried their dead in a mound structure approximately one mile north of Hume, although there is no evidence to support this claim. The first known Euro-American settler in the Hume area was Peter Duncan in 1835. The Bleeding Kansas affair and the upcoming Civil War brought John Brown to this area with an attack on the Lawrence farm, five miles south of Hume, in which slaves were freed. Border warfare fighting began soon after, which cost many lives. The Civil War began in 1861, and within a 40-mile radius of Hume, two battles took place: the Battle of Mine Creek and the Battle of Dry Wood Creek. The war came to a head when Order No. 11 was signed by Gen. Thomas Ewing and led to a burning of settlements in the Hume area.

===Hume&#x27;s early period 1880-1930===
It took many years after Order 11 for the Hume area to recover. A plat was drawn up by Leroy Taylor in 1880 for the town of Howard. Howard was not meant to be, due to the Post Office which had a town of Howard Mills, MO registered, and fearful of confusion, Howard had to change its name. The name, even today, is still debated upon. Tradition is that Hume got its name from a whiskey bottle falling off a train; however on Taylor&#x27;s original plat, he had a Hume Street drawn on it. The population was about 1,000 at the beginning. Noah Little had to redraw Taylor&#x27;s Plat and designed the town of Hume. Hume has many catalpa trees, due to a nurseryman in trouble for public intoxication who had to plant the trees as part of his punishment. Two railroads lines used to run through, now only one of these exists to this day. As for celebrations, the Hume Stock Show began in 1905, eventually the Hume Stock Show morphs into the Hume Fair, which exists today. Hume was known for being the White City on the Border due to local journalist Lewis Moore who advocated painting fences white in Hume. Many people did paint their fences white after this campaign.
===Hume peak coal mining period 1930-1950===
Hume grew immensely due to the coal mining industry and the population peaked at nearly two thousand or more during at the height of coal production. The most prominent coal company in the area was the Hume Sinclair Coal Company. The first public water system was developed in the 1950s. Coal mining did not last past the 1950s and with the closing of coal mines, businesses vanished and people left.

===Hume after coal, hume bank scandal===
The population of Hume reduced to under 200 by the early 1990s. The old Hume high school was demolished in May 1989 and a new high school wing added to the elementary was completed in 1991.

In 2008 nearly one hundred FBI agents and agents of other US departments seized control of the Hume Bank following several reports of embezzlement. Over the course of three days the agents seized banking documents and closed operations of the Hume bank. Soon afterwards Security Bank of neighboring town Rich Hill, Missouri assumed the insured deposits and re-opened the bank as a branch of Security Bank.

The bank scandal in 2008 was completely caused by fiscal mismanagement and embezzlement. In 2009, previous Hume Bank president, Jeffrey W. Thompson, 40, of Hume, Mo., pleaded guilty before U.S. Magistrate Judge Sarah W. Hays to the charges of making false statements to the FDIC as part of a bank fraud scheme that caused such significant losses that the bank was pushed into insolvency. FDIC losses totalled $5,168,580 and total losses were over 6.6 million US dollars.

In 2011 Jeff Thompson was sentenced to six years, six months in Federal prison without the possibility of parole.

<text>Marble Hill is a fourth-class city in central Bollinger County in Southeast Missouri, United States. Located at the intersection of State Highways 34 and 51, it is the largest city in Bollinger and serves as the county seat. The population was 1,388 at the 2020 census. The city was officially organized in July 1851 and is named after a marble-like rock.

Marble Hill is part of the Cape Girardeau−Jackson, MO-IL Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

The area that would eventually become known as Marble Hill was established in 1842 as New California. Nine years later, it was renamed Dallas in 1851. As the area grew over the years, the First Baptist Church was built in 1856 near the oldest cemetery in Marble Hill. In 1862, the courthouse and town of Dallas was raided by Colonel S.D. Kitchen, along with 120 Confederate soldiers. Finally, in 1868, the name of the town was changed again, this time to Marble Hill, to prevent confusion with the already existing Dallas County.

A year after the name change, a man by the name of Eli Lutes laid out what would become known as Lutesville. Lutes offered to the railroad for a depot location which would be used as a shipping and trading point. Disputes with leaders of Marble Hill persuaded the railroad to relocate their route through Lutesville instead.

In 1880, Will Mayfield College moved to Marble Hill from Smithville. It remained in operation there until its closing in 1934. In 1893, Wicecarver&#x27;s Store was built across from the courthouse where the steps in front were formerly used for mounting horses and carriages. Between 1904 and 1905, the Mineral Well was dug on the courthouse square and was used until 1947–1948. The year 1932 marked the last passenger line on the Belmont Branch of the St. Louis &amp; Iron Mountain Railroad. The railroad company ceased operations through Lutesville in 1973. In August 1953, an artesian well was discovered approximately deep while drilling for oil in the area. In 1973, voters approved a measure to build what would become known as Twin City Airport.

It was suggested in 1985 that the towns of Marble Hill and Lutesville should merge. Lutesville, which had been founded in 1869 and later became the main business and shipping center for the area, merged with Marble Hill and maintained the name of Marble Hill because it was the current county seat. The portion of Marble Hill that was the former city of Lutesville is the portion southwest of Crooked Creek. Crooked Creek has flooded the town on many occasions.
