<text>Lonaconing is a town in Allegany County, Maryland, United States, located along the Georges Creek Valley. It is part of the Cumberland, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,214 at the 2010 census.

== History ==
The first non-Native American settlers in the late 18th century were explorers, hunters and farmers. Surnames of some of the first settlers were Dye, Duckworth, Green, Grindle, Fazenbaker, Grove, VanBuskirk, Knapp, and Miller. The first stone house, built in 1790, in Knapps Meadow, just north of Lonaconing, was owned by Samuel VanBuskirk. The house still stands and is a private residence as of 2016. The Lonaconing Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

Lonaconing is the birthplace of Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher Robert Moses (&quot;Lefty&quot;) Grove, (1900-1975), who played notably for the old Baltimore Orioles, 1920–1925, during their famous string of six straight championships in the &quot;Triple A&quot; (AAA) minor league level of the International League, and later for Connie Mack&#x27;s Philadelphia Athletics, (1925-1933) and the Boston Red Sox, 1934–1941, of the American League. Grove&#x27;s &quot;Most Valuable Player&quot; Award is the only one not on display at the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, as it is displayed at the George&#x27;s Creek Library of the Western Maryland Regional Library system.

On January 20, 2021, the fourth largest Powerball and sixth largest lottery jackpot ticket in U.S. history was sold at Coney Market, a convenience store in Lonaconing, to an anonymous winner.

<doc id="116301" wikidata="Q755097" url="?curid=116301" title="Luke, Maryland">
<text>Luke is a town in Allegany County, Maryland, United States, located along the Potomac River just upstream of Westernport. Known originally as West Piedmont, the town is part of the Cumberland, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 85 as of the 2020 census.

==History==
The town of Luke was settled in the early 1770s after the organization of Hampshire County, West Virginia (at that time part of Virginia) in 1757. Among the first settlers to arrive were the Davis brothers (Henry and Thomas), who established a saw mill where the town of Luke now stands. The mill provided cross-ties to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad as it pushed its rails westward through the Piedmont area of what is now West Virginia.

When the railroad suspended building in the 1880s, the Davis brothers disbanded and sold their property to William Luke, who founded the Piedmont Pulp and Paper Company there with his sons in 1888. With this and other paper mills they had built in West Virginia and Maryland, they formed the West Virginia Pulp and Paper Company in 1897. When the railroad needed a name for the stop it established near the site, it used the name &quot;Luke&quot;.

The land on which Luke was built was originally an island formed by a split in the Potomac River. It was known as West Piedmont and claimed by Piedmont, West Virginia until the river&#x27;s path changed and the land reverted to Maryland.

Over the next several decades, Luke prospered with the operation of the paper mill, the influx of other &quot;heavy&quot; industrial concerns, and the establishment of the usual supporting mom-and-pop businesses. Nearby, along the Savage River, there was a gun factory that provided muskets with bayonets for the United States Army at Harpers Ferry. Luke was also home of an automobile manufacturing plant where the Maryland Steamer was produced, as well as a post card factory.

With Luke&#x27;s growth came citizens&#x27; concerns about educational and social issues. Schooling in private homes and business buildings was relocated to a two-room schoolhouse. Growing enrollment in the first through eighth grades brought about construction of a new school that opened in September 1913. It served the town for forty-six years, sending its students off to Bruce High School in Westernport. When the school closed in 1959, the building was converted for use as the town&#x27;s administrative offices.

==Paper company==

Located along the Potomac River basin at the foot of Backbone Mountain, Luke was home to a paper mill that was the largest private employer in Allegany County. The mill&#x27;s owner changed names from the West Virginia Pulp and Paper Company to Westvaco in 1969. Westvaco became Meadwestvaco in January 2002 and its paper business was sold in 2005 to become NewPage. The mill had over a $200 million economic impact on the local economy and supported the coal and rail industry as well as the trucking industry.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency listed the paper plant as one of the largest polluters of mercury in Maryland. In 2007, the paper plant voluntarily installed $30 million worth of pollution control equipment to reduce mercury releases. Mercury is a potent neurotoxin. For burning &quot;black liquor&quot;, a mix of chemicals and wood waste from the paper-making process, the plant received renewable energy subsidies totalling about $4 million through 2015, thanks to amendments the paper mill owner convinced Maryland lawmakers to adopt in 2004.

In January 2015, Verso Corporation completed acquisition of NewPage, which had owned the Luke paper mill for about ten years. As of December 2017, the Luke mill had about 700 employees.

On April 30, 2019, Verso announced the closing of the Luke paper mill by June 30, 2019, due to various economic factors. One of the reasons cited, a rise in importation, had been fought since at least 2007. Maryland&#x27;s governor directed the state&#x27;s labor and commerce departments to do everything possible to help the employees and community. The company said the mill closure would not affect employee pensions, and that their direct employees would receive a severance package. Mayor Clemons, also a local Methodist pastor, organized a nondenominational prayer meeting in mid-May for those affected by the closure, attended by more than 100.

Production at the mill ended on May 31, while employees were paid through June 30, 2019. The Tri-Towns community – consisting of Piedmont in West Virginia, with Luke and Westernport in Maryland – was projected to become devastated by the closure, also to affect suppliers of coal, chemicals, and timber. The mill had supplied Luke with drinking water and paid for most of its wastewater treatment upgrades, both of which had to be reworked. Verso agreed to continue providing water for Luke until a line was extended from Westernport, for which the Maryland Board of Public Works approved more than half a million dollars in August 2020.

In 2019, water analysis by the Upper Potomac Riverkeeper group found toxic substances consistent with black liquor, including arsenic, boron and methyl mercury, originating from the mill; as of October 2019, Maryland environmental officials said they were investigating the leak and taking steps to post advisories nearby. In November 2019, the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection ordered Verso to empty pulping tanks on West Virginia&#x27;s side of the river. Saying the company then put the content into tanks in Maryland, and that a black substance continues to seep into the river, Maryland&#x27;s Department of the Environment filed in February 2020 a notice of intent to sue Verso. The Attorney General of Maryland filed a lawsuit in Allegany County in December 2019 claiming multiple environmental law violations. Maryland had the lead in a federal lawsuit filed in May 2020 against Verso, in which the Potomac Riverkeeper Network participated. Verso settled these lawsuits in April 2021, agreeing to identify the sources and extent of the contamination and create a comprehensive plan to clean it, as well as pay $650,000 to the state of Maryland.

In August 2023, Port River West LLC and JR Vinagro Corporation began to clear up to 55 acres at the former site of the paper mill. As of March 2024, the project is still ongoing with an estimated completion date of summer 2024. No concrete plans have been made regarding the future use of the 55 acres.

<text>Westernport is a town in Allegany County, Maryland, United States, along the Georges Creek Valley. It is part of the Cumberland, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,888 at the 2010 census.

==History==

Westernport&#x27;s first settlement is identified on a French military map dating from 1758. The map is currently on display at École Militaire in Paris. The settlement at that time had no name. By 1774, it was known as Hardscrabble because the rocky soil made planting difficult. Some time in the mid-1790s, the name was changed to Westernport, with the town being the westernmost navigable port on the Potomac River. In the late 18th century and early to mid part of the 19th century, coal and timber was loaded onto flatboats where George&#x27;s Creek empties into the Potomac, then floated down to near Great Falls, Virginia, where the goods were unloaded, the boats broken up to sell as lumber, with the operators walking back to Westernport. The town was incorporated in 1859.

In 1886–87 the Piedmont and Cumberland Railway was built through Westernport, connecting the town to Cumberland.

==Notable people==
*Stephen Wheeler Downey, the &quot;Father of the University of Wyoming&quot;, was born in Westernport.
* Leo Mazzone, former pitching coach of the Baltimore Orioles and Atlanta Braves

==Geography==

== History ==
The area that was to become Cape St. Claire was mostly farmland until the 1940s. In the late 18th century, much of the land was operated as farmland by a couple of families. Two houses from this era remain—the &quot;Stinchcomb House&quot; located near the Cape St. Claire clubhouse, and Goshen Farm, located on a hill near the Cape St. Claire Elementary School.

In the early part of the 20th century, Hugh H. Young, a prominent doctor on the staff of Johns Hopkins University, began buying up the farmland with the intention of building a community. Dr. Young&#x27;s first attempt, a community called Persimmon Point, was less than successful, with only a few lots being sold. This failure was brought on by the Great Depression, and the project was put on hold. Upon Dr. Young&#x27;s death, his children created the River Bay Company to manage the property for development.

The River Bay Company platted the community of Cape St. Claire (incorporating the Persimmon Point property as part of the new community) on June 14, 1949. The community was envisioned and sold as a summer retreat for residents of Washington, D.C., and Baltimore. To manage the affairs of the new community, the River Bay Company created and incorporated the Cape St. Claire Club, governed by a Board of Governors. The first meeting of the Board of Governors of the Cape St. Claire Club (renamed the Cape St. Claire Improvement Association on May 12, 1959) was held on June 30, 1949. The Board consisted of three representatives of the River Bay Company named in the Cape St. Claire Club certificate of incorporation: John G. Rouse, Jr.; James C. Morton, Jr.; and George W. Baker, Jr. James C. Morton was elected Chairman.

In April 1989, the Anne Arundel County Council approved the formation of the Cape St. Claire Special Community Benefits District. The SCBD allows the community to establish a taxing district. The taxes are collected by the county government (as part of the property tax), which are then turned over to the Improvement Association to administer as voted on by the property owners in the community. This special benefits district has allowed the community to purchase additional common property, build a specially-designated fishing/crabbing pier, make improvements to community assets, and hire off-duty county police for additional security.

<doc id="116308" wikidata="Q755950" url="?curid=116308" title="Crofton, Maryland">
<text>Crofton is a census-designated place and planned community in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, United States, located west of the state capital Annapolis, south of Baltimore, and east-northeast of Washington, D.C. The community was established in 1964 and as of the 2020 census, it had a population of 29,136.

==History==

===Development===

In 1963, after the Crawford Corporation accumulated over of land, it announced that it would build a new community called Crofton. This new town and planned community was founded at the same time as Reston, Virginia (April 17, 1964) and Columbia, Maryland (1967). Crofton would be anchored by a community golf course, which later became the Crofton Country Club. Crofton was officially founded in the fall of 1964. The company considered picking an English name for the new town that &quot;sounds well and implies that this is a pleasant place to live.&quot; It ended up picking the name &quot;Crofton&quot;, named after a small township in Cumberland County, England. (Crofton, England was originally called &quot;Croft-town&quot;, derived from the word &quot;Croft&quot;, as the town standing upon the Crofts.) Crofton, Maryland was founded as a community for racial exclusion.

=== Crofton pond snakehead fish incident ===

Crofton was in the national news in late June and early July 2002 after a fish called the northern snakehead was discovered in a local pond. The infestation was found in water behind the Crofton post office and the adjacent shopping center, across Route 3 from local landmark Lake Louise.

The snakehead species is highly aggressive and voracious. In order to ensure that the fish were eliminated, in September 2002 the main pond and two nearby ponds were dosed heavily with rotenone and subsequently with potassium permanganate. Six adult snakeheads and more than one thousand juvenile fish were found and destroyed.

Ultimately, the incident initiated a national discussion on invasive species. One comparison case was the mute swan, also an invasive and destructive species of the Chesapeake Bay watershed but, in comparison, quite beautiful, and which garnered support from some environmental and animal rights groups.

Several movies were inspired by this incident. Syfy aired two movies in relation to the snakehead outbreak: in March 2004, a movie called &quot;Snakehead Terror&quot; was featured, and the movie &quot;Frankenfish&quot; was aired in June 2004. Ten Pound Films also produced a feature film titled &quot;Swarm of the Snakehead&quot; which related to this incident. In 2007, a documentary titled &quot;Fishzilla: Snakehead Invasion&quot; aired on the National Geographic Channel, discussing the ecological damage that the snakeheads found in Crofton have done to surrounding areas.

== Geography ==
The original community of Crofton was built on the Duvall family farm located within a triangle formed by three major roads: Crain Highway (Maryland Route 3) to the northwest, Davidsonville Road (Maryland Route 424) to the northeast, and Defense Highway (Maryland Route 450) to the south. Within the triangle, Crofton Parkway, a loop road long, encircles the center of the community.

The Crofton CDP now extends north and east from the triangle, including Crofton Park and reaching northeast as far as St. Stephens Church Road.

The Little Patuxent River borders Crofton on its southwest corner at the intersection of Route 3 and Route 450, providing a buffer between Anne Arundel and Prince Georges counties.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Crofton CDP has a total area of , all land.

==Education==

<text>Deale is a census-designated place (CDP) in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, United States. The population was 4,945 at the 2010 census. It has a scenic view of Chesapeake Bay and is popular with boaters. Sudley was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.

== History ==

Archaeologists have found evidence of nomadic Paleo-Indian tribes in the area dating as far back as 8,000 B.C., with a larger, more permanent campsite in nearby West River dating to 2,000 B.C. Deale was situated in the heart of the hunting territories claimed by the Susquehannock people and within the bounds of the land claimed by the Piscataway people.

European settlers first arrived in Anne Arundel County around 1649 from southeast Virginia during the English Civil War to escape religious persecution. In 1655, they settled Herring Creek, an area that encompasses present-day Deale. They had converted to Quakerism from Puritanism and other Protestant faiths, due to the influence of missionaries that had arrived in the area.

The land was mainly used for farming until around 1870, when watermen from Long Island and Maryland&#x27;s Eastern Shore settled near Herring Bay&#x27;s oyster beds. By 1920, some of the farms transitioned into summer communities, and businesses in Deale began building, repairing and renting boats to summer tourists. They also built restaurants and shops to accommodate the visitors. By 1960, some watermen became charter fishing captains offering fishing trips on the Chesapeake to visitors from Baltimore and Washington D.C.

<text>Glen Burnie is an unincorporated town and census-designated place (CDP) in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, United States. It is a suburb of Baltimore. The population was 72,891 at the 2020 census.

==History==
In 1812, Elias Glenn, a district attorney, established a county seat near what is currently known as Brooklyn Park. He named his property &quot;Glennsburne&quot;. The name was changed to &quot;Glennsbourne Farm&quot;, and eventually &quot;Glenburnie&quot;, as the property was passed through Glenn&#x27;s descendants. Records also show the name as &quot;Tracey&#x27;s Station&quot; and &quot;Myrtle&quot;, after local postmaster Samuel Sewell Tracey and one of Tracey&#x27;s boarders, before the final decision was made.

In 1854, William Wilkins Glenn, Elias Glenn&#x27;s grandson, incorporated the Curtis Creek Mining, Furnace and Manufacturing Company into his family&#x27;s property. The business flourished during the 19th century, and with it came several thousand acres of land in northern Anne Arundel County.

Upon the death of William Wilkins Glenn, his son, brother and nephew began to manage the family&#x27;s business affairs, and Glenburnie became an official state subdivision in 1888. The Glenn family contracted George T. Melvin and Henry S. Mancha to lay out and promote the town. It would not be until 1930 that postmaster Louis J. DeAlba decided two words were better than one, and gave the town a final name change to the current Glen Burnie.
Among the earliest Glen Burnie schools was First Avenue Elementary, built in 1899. The oldest area church is St. Alban&#x27;s Episcopal, which was built in 1904, with many of its bricks dating back to Marley Chapel, an early Maryland parish from the 1730s. Crain Highway, one of Glen Burnie&#x27;s main thoroughfares (named after Robert Crain), opened in 1927 and Ritchie Highway (Maryland Route 2, named for ex-Governor Albert C. Ritchie) followed in 1939. Ritchie Highway carried nearly all Baltimore-area traffic headed for Annapolis and the Chesapeake Bay Bridge until an alternate bypass road, Interstate 97, opened in the 1980s.

Until 1950 the Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad provided passenger and freight service through Glen Burnie from Annapolis to Baltimore; passenger service ended in February 1950 due to increased competition from buses and private automobiles, but freight service continued until Hurricane Agnes did so much damage to a trestle crossing the Severn River in Annapolis that the trestle was condemned for use by trains by the Army Corps of Engineers in the late 1960s. (The trestle remained as a haven for fishermen and crabbers until it was dismantled.) North Glen Burnie is now served by the Baltimore Light Rail system&#x27;s Cromwell/Glen Burnie station.

Schools and churches were built in the ensuing decades, and construction was completed on Harundale Mall, the first enclosed shopping center east of the Mississippi River, in 1958. It was one of the first shopping centers to be called a &quot;mall&quot; and was developed by James W. Rouse of the Rouse Company (which also developed nearby Columbia, Maryland). The mall was developed in a joint effort with a local real estate developer, Charles Steffey. The originally planned location was not on Ritchie Highway but on Crain Highway (the main arterial for Glen Burnie). Charlie Steffey and Jim Rouse negotiated unsuccessfully with the &quot;city fathers&quot; of Glen Burnie, offering to regenerate the (then failing) center of town with their revolutionary concept. The &quot;sticking point&quot; was that the intersection of Crain Highway and Quarterfield Road (the proposed location) habitually flooded in even nominal rainstorms, to the point of cars being up to their doors in the river that ensued.

The &quot;city fathers&quot; decided that the advantage of having the &quot;mall&quot; there was overshadowed by the cost of fixing the storm water situation and declined. As a result, Glen Burnie Mall followed in 1962. Marley Station, another large shopping center, opened in February 1987. The Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration office building employs many people in town. In the 1970s, developers tried to make Glen Burnie more urban by building and funding new projects, projects like Empire Towers in 1974, or Crain Towers in 1990, then with the addition of an Anne Arundel Community College branch in the town center. In 1965, North Arundel Hospital opened as a community hospital, but as it was constantly overflowed with patients, the University of Maryland Medical System bought the hospital in 2000 and renovated it to accommodate more patients and equipment.

Green Haven developed into a small community in the early 20th century, with a district town center. With the rise of suburbs, Green Haven became increasingly residential in nature, with local shops closing under pressure from nearby plazas and strip malls.

Today, Green Haven has lost much of its unique character because of the loss of its old style &quot;summer home&quot; charm, and the loss of its fire department that was complemented by green and white fire equipment, however, it is still the largest single neighborhood within Pasadena. Green Haven is home to one of Pasadena&#x27;s two high schools, Northeast High.

<doc id="116316" wikidata="Q2661909" url="?curid=116316" title="Highland Beach, Maryland">
<text>Highland Beach is a town in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 118. The town was founded late in the 19th century by affluent African Americans from Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, looking for a summer retreat on the Chesapeake Bay. The town&#x27;s incorporated status gave it a unique standing in empowering it to maintain its own police force. Celebrities with homes there have included historian and author Alex Haley, actor and comedian Bill Cosby, and tennis champion Arthur Ashe. Street names in the town include Crummell, Dunbar, Henson, Augusta, Douglass, Langston, and Washington, which were chosen to honor leading African Americans.

==History==
Highland Beach was founded in summer 1893 by Maj. Charles Remond Douglass, (Frederick Douglass&#x27;s son) and his wife, Laura, after they had been turned away from a restaurant at the nearby Bay Ridge resort because of their race. Charles Douglass was a retired military officer who served with the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment of the United States Colored Troops during the American Civil War. After being turned away, Maj. Douglass decided to buy beachfront property directly south of Bay Ridge and sell lots to family and friends.
Maj. Douglass bought a tract with of beachfront on the Chesapeake Bay from Daniel Brashears, a Black farmer and waterman of Anne Arundel County, and turned it into a summer enclave. He had two homes built - one for himself, his wife, and their children, and one as a retirement home for his father, Frederick Douglass, which was known as &quot;Twin Oaks.&quot; Frederick Douglass&#x27;s house, now called the Douglass Summer House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. It became a regular gathering place for upper-class African-Americans. Robert Terrell, the first Black municipal court judge in Washington, DC, and his wife, activist and civic leader, Dr. Mary Church Terrell, built a home, &quot;Villa Aloha,&quot; in 1915 on the property they purchased in 1893, which was next door to the Douglass Summer House. Their grandson, Raymond L. Langston, former Highland Beach mayor, owns this home. 

Among the residents and guests of the town were Paul Robeson, Robert Weaver, Harriet Tubman, W. E. B. Du Bois, and poets Langston Hughes and Paul Laurence Dunbar. Frederick Douglass visited and would have become a resident but he died in 1895, before the house that his son was building for him was completed.

In the early 1900s, a horse stable, a guest house, a hotel, and tennis courts were all built in the community to accommodate the growing number of residents and their guests. The guest house, which was built by George Bowen in 1902, was a very popular site for lectures, discussions, and informal gatherings. The hotel, which was built by Richard Francis Ware in the 1920s, was a popular spot for Saturday night dances and a meeting place for church groups. It was converted to a private home in the 1970s. 

After the death of Charles R. Douglass in 1920, his son, Haley G. Douglass, took over the development of the area. Haley Douglass became a member of the Board of Commissioners for the town of Highland Beach, and incorporated the town on May 12, 1922, making it the first African-American municipality in Maryland. He and his friends controlled the community for the next thirty years, keeping it small and exclusive. He served as Mayor of Highland Beach from the time of its incorporation through his death on January 20, 1954. In 1922, Osborne T. Taylor, a Highland Beach resident, bought 13 acres south of Highland Beach and created Venice Beach, which still exists. 

In the June 29, 1950, edition of the &quot;Cumberland Evening Times&quot; (of Cumberland, Maryland), Census District Supervisor Everard Briscoe mentioned that Highland Beach had 45 homes and five year-round residents, with all of the 45 homes being occupied during vacation season. In the September 18, 1968, edition of The Evening Sun (of Baltimore, Maryland), Highland Beach is described as a &quot;44-acre retreat of 52 clapboard, shingle, and stucco cottages that date back to 1894 - plus 1,000 feet of waterfront where no pets or picnicking are allowed.&quot; A Dr. E. B. Henderson, 85 years old at that time, is named as the only surviving member of the 1922 incorporating committee. He is mentioned as the former head of Physical Education in DC Public Schools, with about 40 years of service there. According to Dr. Henderson, poet Paul Laurence Dunbar wrote &quot;Ships that Pass in the Night,&quot; one of his most famous poems, while visiting Highland Beach. Mrs. Fannie Howard Douglass, widow of Joseph H. Douglass (grandson of Frederick Douglass), was in her 80s and living in the Twin Oaks home at the time of this article. Joseph and Fannie&#x27;s son, Frederick Douglass, III, married Nettie Hancock Washington, the granddaughter of Booker T. Washington, joining two of the most esteemed Black families of the 19th and 20th centuries. 

Although founded as a summer resort, it is now a town of year-round residents who choose not to permit commercial establishments. There are some sixty homes, many of them still owned and occupied by descendants of the original settlers. The residents are proud and protective of their town&#x27;s heritage, established over a century ago by people determined to overcome the prejudices of their post-Reconstruction times. However, as of the 2000 census, less than 40 percent of the town&#x27;s residents were African American. A 2018 report however, indicated that 53.5% of the population of 114 people identified as Black.

The history of Highland Beach is recounted in the book &quot;The Land Was Ours: African American Beaches from Jim Crow to the Sunbelt South&quot; by Andrew W. Kahrl. The author described the development of Highland Beach as part of the emergence of a niche market in African American planned vacation communities. &quot;Highland Beach on the Chesapeake Bay: Maryland&#x27;s First African American Incorporated Town&quot; is another book about the town which was written by longtime residents &quot;–&quot; Jack E. Nelson, Margo Dean Pinson, and former mayor, Raymond L. Langston. 

Highland Beach is located at (38.931880, -76.466455).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

==Transportation==

The main method of transportation to and from Highland Beach is by road. However, no state highways serve the town, and the only road providing access is Bay Highlands Drive.

<text>Linthicum is a census-designated place (CDP) and unincorporated community in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, United States. The population was 10,324 at the 2010 census. It is located directly north of Baltimore–Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI).

Designated as &quot;Linthicum Heights&quot; and zip code 21090 by the U.S. Postal Service, Linthicum has been traditionally divided into two distinct communities each with its own community association and identity. These two communities, split by the Baltimore Beltway in 1957, are Linthicum and North Linthicum (or, alternatively, Linthicum-Shipley and North Linthicum.) Both communities developed as a result of their locations adjacent to the Baltimore and Annapolis Short Line railroad which brought commuters to the original truck farming community.

As a developed community, Linthicum began with the 1908 founding of the &quot;Linthicum Heights Company&quot;, though a &quot;Linthicum&quot; or &quot;Linthicum&#x27;s&quot; station on the 1887 Annapolis and Baltimore Short Line railroad existed at least as early as 1889. The community&#x27;s name was from the area&#x27;s primary land-owning family since an 1801 purchase by Abner Linthicum.

<text>Londontowne is an unincorporated area and former census-designated place (CDP) in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, United States, and the site of a former colonial seaport founded on the South River in 1683. The population was 7,595 at the 2000 census. At the 2010 census, the area was delineated as the Edgewater CDP.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP had a total area of 3.8 square miles (9.8 km), of which 3.0 square miles (7.8 km) was land and 0.8 square mile (2.0 km) (20.11%) was water.

==History==
London Town was a colonial seaport settlement founded in 1683 near Annapolis. The original wharf was built by Colonel William Burgess, one of the area&#x27;s original settlers. He parceled his land and sold it and it was established as a town by an act of 1683. It was once considered as the site for the Province of Maryland and was for a time as prominent in trade as Annapolis and Williamsburg, Virginia. It declined and disappeared by the 19th century for reasons including its non-selection as a tobacco inspection station, economic depression, and the Revolutionary War.

Speculation exists that the South River Club&#x27;s first clubhouse was built here.

==Historic London Town and Gardens==

Today, the area of the old town comprises the Historic London Town and Gardens, owned by Anne Arundel County and operated by the London Town Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit. The park includes the London Town Publik House, listed on the National Register of Historic Places and designated a National Historic Landmark, as well as reconstructed period buildings, a public museum, an archaeology lab, and extensive gardens. The park offers guided tours, musket fire demonstrations, and various other educational events, and its facilities may be rented as an event venue.

London Town&#x27;s woodland gardens began in the late 1960s as naturalized shade gardens. Today they include an azalea glade with both deciduous and evergreen plantings; a camellia walk with winter blooming camellias; a holly collection; and a winter garden featuring plants of winter interest, with evergreens such as mountain laurel (&quot;Kalmia latifolia&quot;).

<doc id="116324" wikidata="Q753584" url="?curid=116324" title="Odenton, Maryland">
<text>Odenton ( ) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, United States, located approximately 10–20 minutes from the state capital, Annapolis. The population was 37,132 at the 2010 census, up from 20,534 at the 2000 census. The town&#x27;s population growth rate of 80.8% between 2000 and 2010 was the greatest of any town in western Anne Arundel County. Odenton is located west of Annapolis, south of Baltimore, and northeast of Washington, D.C..

In recent years, Odenton has become the fastest-growing city in the county with 2010 census numbers reporting 42% growth. This is because of its proximity to Fort George G. Meade, which contains NSA headquarters, U.S. Cyber Command (established 2009), and the Defense Information Systems Agency (moved to Fort Meade in 2011). Odenton&#x27;s growth can also be attributed to it being centrally located between Annapolis, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. The development has been fueled by the construction of the massive Piney Orchard development, progress in the ongoing development of Odenton Town Center, and construction of the NSA East Campus Integration Program scheduled for completion in 2028.

==Etymology==
The town is named after former Governor of Maryland Oden Bowie. It is bordered by Gambrills to the east, Severn to the north, Fort Meade to the west, and Crofton to the south. It is located at the intersection of Maryland routes 170 and 175 and is bordered by Route 32 to the north. The zipcode is 21113.

==History==

In 1840, the steam-powered Annapolis and Elk Ridge Railroad (A&amp;ER) was built across a sparsely settled farming community that would later become Odenton. At the beginning of the Civil War, Union soldiers guarded this railroad line because it was the only link between the North and the nation&#x27;s capital. Rail traffic through Baltimore had been disrupted by southern sympathizers, so supplies, mail and soldiers flowed through Annapolis and west Anne Arundel County to Washington.

The town of Odenton, nicknamed &quot;The Town a Railroad Built&quot; by Catherine L. O&#x27;Malley, was formed in 1868 with the construction of the Baltimore Potomac (B&amp;P) Railroad connecting Baltimore and Washington, D.C. Where the B&amp;P crossed the A&amp;ER, a train station and telegraph office were constructed and named for Oden Bowie, president of the B&amp;P and former governor of Maryland. Train service to the station began on July 2, 1872. The rail junction (today&#x27;s MARC station) at Odenton Road, already a busy thoroughfare from Annapolis to Frederick, became the site of Odenton&#x27;s first commercial center. The Watts and Murray general stores served railroad workers and farmers, and in 1871 a post office was established. A town grew near the junction, houses were built for railroad workers, a Methodist church was dedicated in 1891 and a grade school opened in 1892.

Small villages developed around these various railroad lines, but none amounted to more than a cluster of shops and homes around a train station and post office. The 1878&quot; Maryland Directory&quot; listed the following towns: Conaway, Odenton, Patuxent, Sappington, and Woodwardville. Odenton was the largest, with a population of 100, a church, a school and two stores. In nearby Woodwardville, where the B&amp;P crossed the Little Patuxent River, A. G. Woodward was the postmaster and operated a general merchandise store in a village of 50 people. Two churches and a school served that community. Land was worth from $5 and $30 per acre, producing wheat, corn and tobacco.

Canneries, primarily for tomatoes, were built in many locations in Anne Arundel County, including Odenton and Woodwardville. The George M. Murray Canning House, built in the late 19th century on Odenton Road (behind present day 1380 and 1382 Odenton Road) was a successful operation into the early 1900s.

Shortly after 1900, another company built an electric interurban railroad parallel to the B&amp;P and also electrified the former A&amp;ER. Train service on these lines began in 1908. The Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railroad provided public transportation to central Maryland.

In 1914, the United States Naval Academy purchased the Hammond Manor Farm in neighboring Gambrills for the construction of a dairy following the 1910 typhoid fever outbreak at the academy. The academy operated the dairy until 1998. Until 2005 it was the home of Dean Foods&#x27; Horizon Organic dairy. The farm is currently the home of Maryland Sunrise Farm.

In 1917, at the advent of World War I, Odenton&#x27;s growth was spurred by the establishment of Fort Meade. The United States Department of War acquired of land west of Odenton to develop a training camp, displacing numerous farmers, merchants and public and private enterprises, many of whom moved east to nearby Odenton. The Epiphany Chapel and Church House at Fort Meade was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. This growth accelerated in the 1950s with the establishment of the National Security Agency on the fort and Friendship International Airport (now the Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport) a few miles to the north. Odenton still maintains its railroad history through the Dennis F. Sullivan Maintenance Facility, operated by Amtrak, which maintains track, bridges and other structures on the Amtrak/MARC line between Baltimore and Washington. All of this, as well as the suburban expansion of Baltimore and Washington, D.C., have transformed Odenton from a farmland region to a business, residential and industrial center in Anne Arundel County.

==Geography==
Odenton is located at (39.071276, −76.699756).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land.

Tickets for the games are available online and at the box office. The team sells merchandise such as jerseys, hats, cloths and other items. Piney Orchard was also the practice facility for the Baltimore Skipjacks in the early 1990s.

<text>Severna Park is a census-designated place (CDP) in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, United States. Severna Park is part of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area, and is located approximately north of Annapolis, south of Baltimore and east of Washington, D.C. Severna Park&#x27;s population was 39,933 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The name Severna Park is rumored to originate from a 1906 contest held by Oscar Hatton while the modern community was first becoming established. The winner would receive a portion of land but controversy arose because the winner was an African-American woman, who was instead rewarded $500. However, extensive research by local historian Nelson Molter found no corroborative evidence for this story, suggesting the naming contest is merely a local myth.

Robinson House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Severna Park was originally named &quot;Boone,&quot; and was a stop along the Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad, which was converted to the B&amp;A Rail Trail in 1990. Severna Park is also home to Severn School, a private high school established in 1914 by Rolland Teel as a feeder school to the United States Naval Academy, as well as several other old homes and buildings.

==Geography and transportation==
Severna Park is located at (39.082109, −76.565656), between the eastern shore of the Severn River and northwestern shore of the Magothy River, approximately south of Baltimore and east of Washington, D.C. It is bordered to the north by Pasadena, to the east (across the Magothy River) by Lake Shore, to the southeast by Arnold, to the southwest (across the Severn River) by Herald Harbor and Arden on the Severn, and to the west by Gambrills and Millersville.

Severna Park is split by Ritchie Highway (Maryland Route 2), which runs between Baltimore and Annapolis and directly through Severna Park, serving as one of the main thoroughfares in the area. Other main roads include Benfield Road and Baltimore-Annapolis Boulevard (Maryland Route 648). Interstate 97 runs from Annapolis to Baltimore directly west of Severna Park, passing through Millersville. Severna Park is accessible from I-97 via exit 10 to Benfield Boulevard/Veterans Highway.

Severna Park is served by the Maryland Transit Administration&#x27;s Route 70. A large portion of the Baltimore &amp; Annapolis Trail also runs through Severna Park. The trail, which is now a bike trail, was originally a rail trail before being converted as part of the East Coast Greenway in 1996. The trail&#x27;s headquarters are located on Earleigh Heights Road in Severna Park.

<text>Bowleys Quarters is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Baltimore County, Maryland, United States, with a population of 6,755 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Bowleys Quarters was named for Daniel Bowley, a merchant and sea captain who owned some around Baltimore in the mid-18th century. Bowleys Quarters was used to house his slaves. The area later became a game preserve for waterfowl and a place where presidents and others, including Babe Ruth, came to hunt ducks. The area eventually became known as a vacation spot, and many summer homes were built along the water. Many blue-collar workers were attracted during the industrial boom of the 1920s through the 1950s. Many worked at the nearby Glenn L. Martin company (now Lockheed Martin) and Bethlehem Steel. The community experienced an economic downturn with downsizing of the Martin facility and other area businesses, and Bowleys Quarters became a mix of middle-class homes juxtaposed with modern waterfront homes. Increased interest in waterfront property in the 1990s, combined with the devastation of Hurricane Isabel, has led to revitalization, with some new homes selling for more than $1 million. Once predominantly populated by low-income to middle-class families, the community is now highly desirable for waterfront living.

In September 2003, Bowleys Quarters was substantially damaged by Hurricane Isabel and the resulting flood. According to &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, Isabel destroyed 210 houses in Bowleys Quarters and caused major damage to 632 others.

In 1880, Thomas Carney immigrated to the United States from Ireland and settled in Texas, Maryland. Soon after his arrival, he married the former Mary McDermot and bought forty and one-half acres on the southeast side of the Baltimore and Harford Turnpike.

Several years later (&quot;circa&quot; 1885), the Carney family moved to what is now Harford and Joppa roads, where Thomas Carney opened a general store which is believed to have served as the Eight Mile House on the turnpike. The store was located on the site presently occupied by the Das Bierhalle Restaurant. In the 1880s and 1890s, the store also served as the Carney family home.

When the family grew too large for the store, Mr. Carney built a new house on the hill behind the store. The house was completed in approximately 1898 and stood in the vicinity of what is now Thornewood Court. Thirty-five years later, the Carney house was moved to its present location at the corner of Joppa and Avondale roads and is now a real estate office.

With the passage of time and the suburban growth of Baltimore County, the land once owned by the Carney family has been sold to individuals and developers. However, the Carney family name is now carried by area businesses and clubs. Two institutions, the Carney Library and the Carney Elementary School, also carry the name. Little did Thomas Carney, an industrious Irish immigrant, realize that his memory would live on by a community which bears his name.

The Great Carney Fire of 1911 was started by two boys playing with matches in a weed patch behind Carney’s Hotel (now Das Bierhalle) on Harford Road. When it was finally extinguished 700 acres had burned. The burned over area was located between Harford, Joppa, Belair, and Putty Hill Roads. Fire Companies from Gardenville, Parkville, Hamilton, Towson, and Roland Park responded. The Carney and Snyder homes narrowly survived and are still standing today. Given that this conflagration occurred in 1911, it’s safe to assume at least some of the firefighters were veterans of the Great Baltimore Fire of 1904. Thankfully, no one was killed, and the only injury reported was a firefighter who sustained a sprained ankle.

<text>Catonsville () is a census-designated place (CDP) in Baltimore County, Maryland. The population was 44,701 at the 2020 US Census. The community is a streetcar suburb of Baltimore along the city&#x27;s western border. The town is known for its proximity to the Patapsco River and Patapsco Valley State Park, making it a regional mountain biking hub. The town is also notable as a local hotbed of music, earning it the official nickname of &quot;Music City, Maryland.&quot; Catonsville contains the majority of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), a major public research university with close to 14,000 students.

==History==
===Pre-colonial===
The area of present-day Catonsville was not inhabited by large numbers of Native Americans, rather serving as a hunting ground or a means of transit. However, Native American arrowheads found in the area signal a presence in small numbers. The Patapsco River itself, forming the southern boundary, bears a Native American name. They would have disappeared long before the first settlers encroached on the area, however.

The Native Americans had left behind a number of trails, some of which the earliest settlers adopted them for their own purposes. Rolling Road, for example, originated as a Native American trail, beginning from Elkridge Landing, and traveling north through present-day Catonsville—the road was repurposed as a &quot;rolling road&quot; used to roll hogsheads of tobacco, hence its current name. Another trail was the Old Frederick Road, now known regionally as Johnnycake Road, which began at a point along Gwynns Falls, and traveling northwest, forming what is now Catonsville&#x27;s northern boundary. Another potential Native American trail is Old Frederick Road, branching off from the aforementioned road southwest toward Frederick Road near Ellicott City.

===Hunting Ridge===
The Catonsville region and the surrounding Patapsco River valley remained unsettled for much of Maryland&#x27;s early history, as early communication depended on major bodies of water, and not by land. The region of present-day Catonsville served as hunting grounds for early explorers, and was known in the 17th century and early 18th century as Hunting Ridge, as early hunters and trappers subsisted off game such as deer to feed and clothe themselves. However, it would be decades before the region underwent the settlement process.

===Early settlement===
The earliest formal settlement of present-day Catonsville began in the second half of the 17th century. Incoming settlers at first followed streams by boat or trail, until embarking further uphill for uncultivated land, often using the aforementioned Native trails, as existing settlers took up most of the desirable land around major waterways. It is uncertain if Catonsville&#x27;s earliest settlers came primarily via the Patapsco or Patuxent rivers. Settlers from the latter would have traversed Anne Arundel County, before fording the Patapsco River at Elkridge Landing. As the southern shore of the Patapsco River began to fill with settlers, others began to look northward, a movement which soon increased in rapidity through the latter decades of the century. By the year 1695, much of Hunting Ridge had been settled through land grants, and most of present-day Catonsville land comes from these original land grants.

===Catonsville===
The history of present-day Catonsville follows its main artery, Frederick Road, which the town eventually developed around. In 1787, the Ellicott family built the Frederick Turnpike to transport goods from their flour mill, Ellicott Mills, to the Baltimore harbor. Charles Carroll, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, owned the land around the then newly built road. He instructed his son-in-law, Richard Caton, to develop the area along the road. Caton and his wife, Mary Carroll Caton, lived in Castle Thunder, constructed on the Frederick Turnpike in 1787.

Caton gave his name to the community and called it &quot;Catonville,&quot; although the name was changed to &quot;Catonsville&quot; in the 1830s. Businesses were built along the Frederick Turnpike for travelers traveling from Ellicott City to Baltimore. Catonsville served as a layover stop for travelers and the town increasingly grew and developed. The pleasant surroundings attracted wealthy Baltimore merchants who built large Victorian and colonial summer homes to escape Baltimore&#x27;s summer heat.
Starting in 1862, horsecar services connected Catonsville to Baltimore. In 1884, the Catonsville Short Line railroad was built, providing 8 roundtrip trains to Baltimore daily. This allowed residents to commute to work in Baltimore. Commuter traffic exploded in the 1890s with the construction of electric streetcar lines and fancy housing developments. Catonsville had become one of the first commuter suburbs in the United States. Baltimore has tried to annex Catonsville, although their attempts have all been failures. The last attempt was in 1918.

Homes of all sizes were constructed rapidly through the 1970s, when much of land around the Frederick Turnpike had been converted into housing. A new and modern business district opened along the newly built Baltimore National Pike, north from the Frederick Turnpike.

Catonsville was briefly made famous during the 1968 protest by the &quot;Catonsville Nine&quot;, during which draft records were burned by Catholic anti-war activists.

In 2002, the Maryland legislature issued a proclamation declaring Catonsville to be &quot;Music City, Maryland&quot;, because of the concentration of musical retail stores, venues and educational facilities in the area. Life Sounds Great is a series of compilation albums highlighting Catonsville musicians.

In 2007, &quot;Money&quot; magazine ranked Catonsville the 49th best place to live in the United States and the third best in Maryland and Virginia.

<text>Cockeysville is a census-designated place (CDP) in Baltimore County, Maryland, United States. The population was 20,776 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Cockeysville was named after the Cockey family who helped establish the town. Thomas Cockey (1676–1737) settled in Limestone Valley in 1725 at Taylor&#x27;s Hall (an area now just north of Padonia Road and east of Interstate 83). Joshua Frederick Cockey (1765–1821) built one of the first homes in the area in 1798 and built the first commercial structure, a hotel, in 1810 in what would become the village of Cockeysville. His son, Judge Joshua F. Cockey (1800–1891), was a lifelong resident in the village. As a businessman before being appointed as judge, in the 1830s he built the train station (which would be a stop on the Pennsylvania Railroad) and accompanying commercial buildings.

Cockeysville was the scene of some Civil War activity. Confederate soldiers pushed into the Baltimore area, intending to cut off the city and Washington from the north. On July 10, 1864, Confederate cavalry under General Bradley T. Johnson entered Cockeysville, destroying telegraph lines and track along the Northern Central Railway. They also burned the first bridge over the Gunpowder Falls, just beyond nearby Ashland.

 After the war, Joshua F. Cockey III (1837–1920) founded the National Bank of Cockeysville (1891) and other commercial ventures in the community, as well as developing dwellings along the York Turnpike (now York Road) that made up the village of Cockeysville.

Stone Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Baltimore County School No. 7 was listed in 2000.

==Local institutions==
Cockeysville is home to the Cockeysville Branch of the Baltimore County Public Library and the Historical Society of Baltimore County.

===Schools in Cockeysville===
Public schools:
* Padonia International Elementary
* Warren Elementary School
* Cockeysville Middle School
* Dulaney High School
Private schools:
* St. Joseph School (Pre-K - 8)

===Grand Lodge===

The Grand Lodge of Maryland, Ancient, Free, and Accepted Masons, is located in Cockeysville on a campus. It includes a castle-like structure known as Bonnie Blink (&quot;Beautiful View&quot; in Scots), which is the retirement home for Master Masons, Eastern Star ladies and eligible family members. Located throughout the Grand Lodge are detailed, hand-laid tile storyboards depicting Masonic themes.

Adjacent to the Grand Lodge building is the Freemason&#x27;s Hall, containing the Maryland Grand Lodge Museum. The museum has the desk that George Washington resigned his commission on, prior to becoming president, a rare Latin Bible from 1482, and some jewels and regalia of Maryland&#x27;s past Grand Masters.

==Commerce and industry==
The Texas Quarry, near of the intersection of I-83 and Warren Road, dating back to the 19th century, produces limestone and marble, including the marble used in the first phase of construction (1848–54) of the Washington Monument, the whiter portion towards the bottom half of the monument. During the second phase of construction (1880–84) the monument had to be finished using a slightly different-colored stone, most of which came from the Beaver Dam Quarry (now Beaverdam Pond) near the intersection of Beaver Dam Road and McCormick Road.

Blocks of local marble were also used in 1836 as rail supports in the track bed for the Padonia Road section of the Baltimore and Susquehanna Railroad (which later became part of the Northern Central Railway); the use of marble instead of wood was an experiment that was soon after abandoned.

==Geography==
Cockeysville is located at (39.473273, −76.626703), north of the Baltimore Beltway (Interstate 695) along Interstate 83 and York Road. It is bordered on the east by Loch Raven Reservoir, on the south by Timonium, and on the west by rural Baltimore County. Most commercial activity is concentrated along York Road.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and of it (1.21%) is water.

==Geology==

The Precambrian, Cambrian, or Ordovician Cockeysville Marble underlies much of Cockeysville and has been quarried there.

==Transportation==

===Roads===
*Baltimore-Harrisburg Expressway (I-83)
*Beaver Dam Road
*Cranbrook Road
*McCormick Road
*Padonia Road
*Paper Mill Road/Ashland Road (MD-145)
*Shawan Road

===Public transportation===
The Maryland Transit Administration&#x27;s Light RailLink line runs through Cockeysville. The Warren Road stop is the stop in the area.

Bus Route 93 operates along York and some other roads in the area.

===Northern Central Railway===
The area used to be served by the Northern Central Railway, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). Located on the PRR&#x27;s Baltimore-Harrisburg mainline, Cockeysville saw the passage of many named interstate passenger trains as late as the 1960s, such as the &quot;Liberty Limited&quot; and the &quot;General&quot; to Chicago.

President Abraham Lincoln traveled through Cockeysville on the Northern Central Railway en route to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, to deliver the Gettysburg Address in 1863. Less than two years later, on April 21, 1865, Lincoln&#x27;s funeral train also passed through Cockeysville on its way from Washington, D.C., to his final resting place at Springfield, Illinois.

South of Cockeysville, the Baltimore Light RailLink uses the corridor established by the predecessors of the Northern Central; the corridor north is now the Torrey C. Brown Rail Trail.

<text>Dundalk ( or ) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Baltimore County, Maryland, United States. The population was 67,796 at the 2020 census. In 1960 and 1970, Dundalk was the largest unincorporated community in Maryland. It was named after the town of Dundalk (Irish: &quot;Dún Dealgan&quot;) in County Louth, Ireland. Dundalk is considered one of the first inner-ring suburbs of Baltimore.

==History==

The area now known as Dundalk was explored by John Smith in 1608. Up until this time, the area was home to the tribes of the Susquehanna.

In 1856, Henry McShane, an immigrant from Ireland, established the McShane Bell Foundry on the banks of the Patapsco River in the then far southeastern outskirts of Baltimore. The foundry later relocated to the Patterson Park area of Baltimore until a fire during the 1940s caused it to move to 201 East Federal Street. In addition to bronze bells, the foundry once manufactured cast iron pipes and furnace fittings. When asked by the Baltimore and Sparrows Point Railroad for the name of a depot for the foundry on their rail line, McShane wrote Dundalk, after the town of his birth, Dundalk (Irish: &quot;Dún Dealgan&quot;), in County Louth in Ireland. In 1977, the foundry moved to Glen Burnie and relocated to its current headquarters in St Louis, Missouri in 2019.
In 1916, the Bethlehem Steel purchased of farmland near the McShane foundry to develop housing for its shipyard workers. The Dundalk Company was formed to plan a town in the new style, similar to that of the Roland Park area of Baltimore, excluding businesses except at specific spots and leaving land for future development of schools, playing fields, and parks. By 1917, Dundalk proper was founded, at which point it had 62 houses, two stores, a post office, and a telephone exchange. Streets were laid out in a pedestrian-friendly open grid, with monikers like &quot;Shipway&quot;, &quot;Northship&quot;, &quot;Flagship&quot;, and &quot;Admiral&quot;. The two-story houses had steeply pitched roofs and stucco exteriors. As steel demand increased rapidly during World War I, white workers streamed into Dundalk, pushing black workers into a small community nearby named Turner Station. Turner Station expanded even more during World War II as steel demand increased.

Dundalk was once known as a &quot;Little Appalachia&quot; or a &quot;hillbilly ghetto.&quot; Before, during, and after World War II, many Appalachian migrants settled in the Baltimore area, including Dundalk. Appalachian people who migrated to Dundalk were largely economic migrants who came looking for work.

Prior to the passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, racial covenants were used in Maryland to exclude African-Americans and other minorities. A 1920 advertisement in the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; advertised houses in Dundalk as racially &quot;restricted&quot;.

The Dundalk Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.

<text>Essex is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Baltimore County, Maryland, United States. Essex history dates back to 1909. The population was 40,505 in the 2020 census, up from 39,262 in the 2010 census.

==History==

Essex is located on a peninsula bodied by the middle river to the east and the back river to the west. Essex was originally ten blocks, running from Mace Avenue to Marlyn Avenue. It began in 1909 by the Taylor Land Company for the residents in Baltimore who wanted a place outside the city limits to perhaps grow a garden or to pursue some other rural activity. Land was cheap, and sales were enhanced by a promotional pamphlet.

Henry Guttenberger built the first general store in Essex in 1910 on the corner of Eastern Boulevard and Mace Avenue. Between 1911 and 1912, the Taylor Land Company donated the lots for Essex Methodist and St. John&#x27;s Lutheran churches. They also donated the land where the volunteer fire department built their station. The permanent fire station opened in 1921.

With the ever-growing population came the need to build schools. The elementary school opened in 1925 with 400 students. Essex Community College, now CCBC-Essex, was founded in 1957. Classes were first held at Kenwood High School, with fifty part-time and nine full-time students. In 1961, the college moved to Dorsey Avenue, and in 1968 moved to its present location, in Rossville. This site was owned by the Mace family, and the family burial plot is maintained and protected by the college.

A fire in August 1957 destroyed an entire block of businesses on Eastern Boulevard, and the town&#x27;s business district never fully recovered from that catastrophe. The ten-alarm blaze caused a half million dollars in damages, in the time it took to repair the buildings new shopping centers were built changing the buying habits of consumers.

The Glenn L. Martin Company was the single biggest reason for the rapid growth of the area. Employment at the company peaked at more than 53,000 workers during World War II. In the years following, industry in the area dwindled, and much of the original Glenn L. Martin facility became the property of the State, including Martin State Airport. The remaining aerospace business followed a progression of corporate mergers and today is owned and operated by Lockheed Martin.

Another important company was Eastern Rolling Mill, which opened in 1919. The plant, at the head of the Back River, produced carbon sheet steel. In 1944, Eastern merged with Industrial Stainless Steel, Inc. to form Easco. The plant then merged with the British company Avesta-Sheffield in the early 1990s, finally shutting down operations in the late 1990s.

Today, there is interest in revitalizing Essex by including it in government-sponsored empowerment zones. Many neighborhoods have begun a &quot;clean-up&quot; of their areas, hoping to transform Essex into a place that will be ready to move into the twenty-first century. Improvements include removal of run-down, low-income housing, including the Tall Trees Community, Edgewater apartments, and the Riverdale Community; new medians and pavement on Eastern boulevard; a new Essex monolith replaced the old Essex cube, and new developments being built around the town.

Ballestone Mansion (Ballestone-Stansbury House) built in 1800 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975.

The town has a strip of shops known as the business district on Eastern boulevard starting from Virginia avenue to Marlyn avenue. The business district originally started from Mace Avenue to Marlyn Avenue. Its largest shopping center, Middlesex, was built in 1955 which once had a department store Montgomery Ward and grocery store Food Fair as anchors of the shopping center.

On August 2, 2009, the community of Essex celebrated its 100th birthday with a party at Cox&#x27;s Point Park on Riverside Drive.

==Geography==
Essex is located at (39.307737, −76.451710).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 22.16%, is water.

The town is on mostly flat to gently rolling terrain, transitioning to marshland at the tip of the peninsula close to the Chesapeake Bay. Essex has a small island on the Chesapeake Bay named Hart Miller Island. The island is only accessible by boat, and the closest boat launch is located in Rocky Point. The island boasts an observation tower, beaches, and hiking trails. A made made landfill linking two Chesapeake islands consisting of Hart and Miller island.

<text>Hampton is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Baltimore County, Maryland, United States. The population was 5,052 at the 2010 census. Hampton is often considered a subdivision of the nearby community of Towson and is located just north of Baltimore, about twenty minutes from downtown. Hampton contains residences situated on lots up to several acres in a park-like setting (current zoning limits density to not more than two residential units per acre). The community is anchored by its principal landmark, the Hampton National Historic Site. The Towson United Methodist Church is located in Hampton, flanked on the south by I-695 and Goucher College.

==History==
In ancient times, the land was frequented by Susquehannock Indians, who used what became nearby Joppa Road as a trail. The area now known as Hampton was originally part of a land grant given to a relative of Lord Baltimore in 1695. His heirs sold the land on April 2, 1745, to Col. Charles Ridgely (1702–72), a tobacco farmer and trader. In the latter half of the 18th century, the Hampton Mansion was built by the Ridgely family, who used the surrounding land for farming, including apple orchards and the breeding of thoroughbred race horses, along with slave quarters.

Succeeding generations of Ridgelys continued to own the land until 1929, when the Hampton Development Company was formed and the land around the Hampton Mansion was subdivided, creating the modern Hampton community. The Hampton Mansion continued to be owned by the Ridgely family until 1948, when the house and the remaining of the Ridgely estate were designated a National Historic Site and sold to a preservation trust, eventually to be acquired and now operated by the National Park Service.

In 1958, the Towson United Methodist Church completed construction of its large Georgian-style sanctuary with a 235-foot (72 m) spire on of land in Hampton. In 2008, the church announced plans to sell a outparcel of undeveloped, wooded property to a developer for construction of a senior housing complex. A zoning change application was submitted to Baltimore County to increase density to 16 residential units per acre. However, the Hampton Improvement Association, representing neighborhood residents, objected, saying they &quot;oppose zoning changes that would allow higher density residential development and require trees to be knocked down&quot;. The church subsequently dropped plans for the development, saying it wished to remain a good neighbor. The church now has a walking path in the forested area for meditation, open to the public during daylight hours.

<text>Kingsville is a semi-rural, unincorporated community and census-designated place in Baltimore County, Maryland, United States. It is a close-knit and rustic community bounded by the Little Gunpowder Falls river (to the northeast) and the Big Gunpowder Falls river (to the southwest) which join to form the Gunpowder River. The population of Kingsville was 4,318 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Kingsville takes its name from Abraham King (1760–1836), who died there on December 15 at the age of 76. King, a native of Willistown Township, Chester County, Pennsylvania, acquired some of land from Thomas Kell (a county judge) in and about the site of Kingsville from parts of the original grants of Leaf&#x27;s Chance, William the Conqueror, Selby&#x27;s Hope, John&#x27;s Delight and Onion&#x27;s Prospect Hill, according to a deed executed May 13, 1816. King lived in the old Hugh Deane-John Paul mansion (later known as the Kingsville Inn and presently as the Lassahn Funeral home on Belair Road) with his wife Elizabeth Taylor, a sister of the Hon. John Taylor of Willistown, who settled in the West and was the Chief Judge of the Superior Court of Mississippi for a number of years. An 1823 assessment of Old District 2 showed &quot;Abraham King with 290 acres of &#x27;William the Conqueror&#x27; and $350 worth of improvements, no slaves.&quot;

The King family operated a tavern according to an 1847 advertisement in &quot;American Farmer&quot; (a pioneer agricultural journal) at the forks of Bel Air and Joppa (presumably present day Jerusalem) roads. U.S. postal records indicate that a post office was established at King&#x27;s Tavern on January 29, 1829, with a George King noted as the postmaster; the office was named &quot;Kingsville&quot; on January 8, 1830. In 1840, State Geologist John Henry Alexander was the first to put Kingsville on a map.

Kingsville is bordered by the restored Jerusalem Mill Village museum, Jericho Farm, and the renovated Jericho Covered Bridge on the banks of the Little Gunpowder Falls. They are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Mays Chapel is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Baltimore County, Maryland, United States. The population was 11,420 at the 2010 census.

==History==
Mays Chapel Village was developed in the 1970s. The property was originally a large farm known as Mayfair, whose 1812 stone house remains overlooking Greenpoint Road near its intersection with Avebury Road. The land originally belonged to Thomas Cockey Deye, and it was the home of Frederick Price and Penelope Deye Owings Price. Penelope Price was later remarried, taking the surname Goodwin. The 1850 Baltimore County Atlas confirms Mrs. Goodwin&#x27;s residency in the dwelling. Upon her death in 1875, the property passed to her heirs, first to Eliza Goodwin and then Charles E.R. Goodwin. In 1904, the property finally passed out of the family upon its conveyance to Fairfax S. Landstreet from then-owner Edward G. Cherbonnier. The original road leading from York Road was called Landstreet Road, and while this is now cut off by Interstate 83, the lot on which the 1812 house stands is still listed as being on Landstreet Road. The farmland was sold for development in the 1970s, and Mays Chapel Village was named for a nearby mid-19th century church.

<text>Overlea is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Baltimore County, Maryland, United States. The population was 12,275 at the 2010 census. Students attend Overlea High School. Area roads include Belair Road (U.S. Route 1) and Kenwood Avenue (Maryland Route 588).

Overlea includes the neighborhood of Fullerton.

==Geography==
Overlea is located at (39.361107, −76.519535).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all land.

==History==
Overlea first started out as a 43-acre tract, owned by Margaret Fuller (Fullerton, Maryland, is named for her most likely). This tract started in 1858, just three years before the start of the American Civil War. She was a widow and brought her six children with her. Margaret Fuller originally hailed from Ohio. The 43-acre tract was referred to as &quot;Sophie’s Garden Regulated&quot;. This original tract is located around the intersection of Belair Road and Taylor Avenue, along with the original house still standing there today. In 1885, the first Post office and general store were established. Later in 1886, Fullerton School was established as a one roomed log house, and was rebuilt as a frame house. Overlea began to truly develop in 1895 when the Kennard Land Company bought Lange&#x27;s Farm (either Fuller&#x27;s original tract, or a different tract, or possibly both). Kennard Land company mapped out the streets as: Spruce, Ash, Cedar, Maple, Hickory, Chestnut, Walnut, Willow, Beech, Poplar, Elm and Linden. Streets were named after trees. In 1910, a &quot;town hall&quot; was built on the Corner of Overlea Avenue and Belair Road, and still stands there today as the Natural History Society of Maryland. The town hall served as a grocery store as well. On February 23, 1913, a group of suffragists called &quot;The Army of the Hudson&quot; stopped at the town hall on their way from New York City to the march organized in Washington, D.C., by the National American Woman Suffrage Association. They held a meeting in the town hall, and although many were not sympathetic, a few showed support. In the same year, St. Michael&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church held its first mass in the town hall. In 1919, The City of Baltimore annexed a portion of Overlea to what is now Overlea, Baltimore.

There is also public bus service available on Maryland Transit Administration bus route nos. 87 and 89. Both routes operate on Painters Mill Road, to the mall and the Metro, and on different portions of Reisterstown Road.

==Attractions and facilities==
Owings Mills is home to approximately a dozen major shopping centers and numerous office buildings. In the center of Owings Mills was Owings Mills Mall, an enclosed shopping mall. The mall, which opened in 1986, once featured more than 150 stores. The mall closed in 2015, and was completely demolished in March 2017. The former mall has since been redeveloped into Mill Station, which is a 620,000 sq ft retail development. The first retailer to open its doors in the new Mill Station was Costco, who hosted their ribbon cutting ceremony in October 2018. It is also within walking distance to the Metro Centre, which holds the northern most stop on the Baltimore Metro, along with restaurants and shopping.

Many nationally known organizations and businesses call Owings Mills home, including CareFirst, T. Rowe Price, Lion Brothers, The Baltimore Life Companies, Talbot Settlement &amp; Escrow, Black &amp; Decker, the Baltimore Ravens headquarters facility, and Maryland Public Television studios (formerly the Maryland Center for Public Broadcasting). A large manufacturing complex dates to 1926 as the site of Maryland Baking Company, and then starting in 1957 housed Maryland Cup (see Sweetheart Cup Company), the Fort Howard Paper Corporation (see Georgia-Pacific), and finally the Solo Cup Company, which closed the plant in 2011. In 2015, the property started redevelopment into a shopping complex, Foundry Row. The first store to open in Foundry Row was Wegmans, which launched in September 2016.

The Irvine Nature Center moved to a property here, in the Caves Valley Historic District, in 2008.

The abandoned Rosewood Center, a former asylum for people with mental disabilities, is in Owings Mills. It was shut down in 2010 due to numerous issues, including lead and asbestos contamination, and lack of equipment inventory. It was used as a training location for the Maryland state police until 2013, when a police officer in training was shot and killed on the location during training. Stevenson University acquired Rosewood in 2017 and finalized an agreement with the State of Maryland in September 2020 for the redevelopment of the site for their addition to the campus, to be known as Owings Mills East. The development is expected to take 18 months, and as of December 2020 has been continuing as scheduled despite the COVID-19 pandemic.

==In media and popular culture==
* The TV program &quot;Wall $treet Week with Louis Rukeyser&quot; was produced by Maryland Public Television at its studios in Owings Mills during its original run from 1972 to 2005; many viewers became familiar with the town as the program&#x27;s mailing address. Others became familiar with it as the mailing address of the still-running weekly automotive series &quot;MotorWeek&quot; since 1981. Local roads can often be seen on the program.
* Rosewood Center is the location for the film &quot;The Institute&quot;.

==Perry Hall Improvement Association==

The Perry Hall Improvement Association (PHIA) is the oldest and largest civic organization in northeastern Baltimore County, Maryland. Since Perry Hall is not incorporated, the PHIA is the dominant communitywide coalition in the area. 
An early version of the PHIA operated during the Second World War when Perry Hall residents organized a Health Committee to help veterans purchase wheelchairs, crutches, and other equipment. After the war ended, many of these leaders decided to create a permanent organization. The first meeting of the Perry Hall Improvement Association was held on July 31, 1945.

After World War II, there was a wave of growth in northeastern Baltimore County. The PHIA defeated plans for a cemetery on the South Farm, a racetrack on Forge Road, and a drive-in movie theater near St. Joseph&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church. The PHIA also lobbied for lights along Joppa, Forge, and Cross Roads and Schroeder and Bauer Avenues. The PHIA pressured Baltimore County officials to fund road improvements and build new schools. Its most significant accomplishment came on September 8, 1963, when Baltimore County Executive Spiro Agnew and other officials dedicated the new Perry Hall library on Belair Road.

The PHIA worked on civic activities as well, starting a Community Christmas Party in 1946 and a Halloween Parade in 1949. In 1976, the PHIA helped form a Bicentennial Committee that hosted events at the old Perry Hall School. By the 1970s and 1980s, however, leaders spent much of their time dealing with development. The most symbolic loss for the community was the development of Lassahn Field, long used for soccer games, carnivals, and Easter egg hunts.

By the early 1990s, the community celebrated the opening of the Seven Oaks Senior Center and two new elementary schools, Seven Oaks and Joppa View. In 1994, the PHIA provided critical local support for the Honeygo Plan, a blueprint for developing Perry Hall&#x27;s rural northeast.

With the Honeygo Plan adopted and much of the community now built-out, the PHIA focused in the late 1990s on some of the civic activities that had been abandoned years earlier. In 2000, Perry Hall celebrated its 225th birthday. The PHIA worked with other groups to restart the Halloween Parade and begin a summer concert series, the centerpiece of which was a performance by the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. Also, that year, the PHIA worked with other groups and elected officials to preserve the Perry Hall Mansion. The mansion was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. In November 2001, Baltimore County leaders announced plans to purchase the property.

Between 1996 and 2009, the PHIA membership grew from 200 members to more than 2,000. Recently, the PHIA has focused on construction of a new Perry Hall Schools, completion of several new parks, stopping overdevelopment, and strategies to reduce school overcrowding.

The PHIA is governed by an executive board that includes Jack Amrhein, president; Kevin Leary, vice-president; Tom Benisch, treasurer; Renee Papavasiliou, secretary; and several members-at-large members.

===Jewish community===

In the 19th and early 20th centuries Jewish immigrants to the Baltimore area first formed enclaves in East Baltimore not far from Johns Hopkins Hospital in neighborhoods such as Broadway East, Jonestown, Middle East and Oliver. After World War II, the Jewish community moved outside of Baltimore City into Pikesville, a sleepy outpost on a major road that led to Western Maryland. During the Vietnam War, and exacerbated by riots in 1968, many Jewish businesses left northwestern Baltimore following this exodus.

Pikesville (and more recently its neighboring communities to the north, Owings Mills and Reisterstown) have been considered the center of the Baltimore area&#x27;s Jewish community since the mid-1950s. Many of the region&#x27;s largest and most established synagogues, Jewish schools, and kosher dining establishments are located in or near Pikesville.

==History==
Pikesville, Maryland, was named for the American soldier and explorer Zebulon Pike (1779–1813). While there are places named for Pike in many other states, Pikesville, Maryland, is the only contemporary place named &quot;Pikesville&quot; (compare, for example, Pike County and Pikeville, Kentucky).

The (historical) town of Pikesville, incorporated August, 1818, in Barren County, Kentucky, in Monroe County after 1820, was apparently named for Zebulon Pike, also. In 1858, the community adopted a new postal name, “Flippin, Kentucky,” to avoid confusion with Pikeville, Kentucky. “Pike[s]ville Branch” of Indian Creek is the only remaining physical landmark of historical Pikesville, in Kentucky, along with a colorful story of an almost forgotten past.

Vernon Lee Evans was a key figure in the battle against lethal injection in Maryland and other states. Prior to Maryland&#x27;s outlawing of capital punishment in 2013, he and Anthony Grandison were on death row for the murders of two clerks at the Warren House Motel (currently a Howard Johnson) in Pikesville in 1983. Governor Martin O&#x27;Malley commuted both men&#x27;s sentences in 2014, along with those of the other two men who were, at the time, on Maryland&#x27;s death row.

Ziad Jarrah, a suspected terrorist involved in the 9/11 attacks, was pulled over two days earlier for speeding in Pikesville.

On April 25th, 2024, Dazhon Darien, the Athletic Director at Pikesville High School, was arrested on terms of falsifying an audio recording of the Principal making racist and antisemitic remarks using artificial intelligence.

<text>Reisterstown is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Baltimore and Carroll counties, Maryland, United States. As of the 2010 census, it had a population of 25,968.

Founded by German immigrant John Reister in 1758, Reisterstown is located to the northwest of Baltimore. Though it is older than the surrounding areas, it now serves primarily as a residential suburb of Baltimore. The center is designated the Reisterstown Historic District and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Also listed are the Montrose Mansion and Chapel and St. Michael&#x27;s Church.

Just outside the community, to its north, is the small military reservation of Camp Fretterd, which serves as a training site for the Maryland Army National Guard and Air Guard. The Maryland Defense Force is also headquartered at Camp Fretterd.

== Geography ==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Reisterstown CDP occupies , all land.

The community stretches along Reisterstown Road (Maryland Route 140) and the Northwestern Expressway (Interstate 795) just north of Owings Mills. Its northern boundary lies near the junction of MD-140 and Hanover Pike (MD-30), which heads north towards Hampstead. MD-140 passes the northern end of I-795 and continues northwest as Westminster Pike, heading towards Finksburg and Westminster. The community of Glyndon is located adjacent to the northern portion of Reisterstown along Butler Road (MD-128), which connects Reisterstown with the Baltimore-Harrisburg Expressway (Interstate 83). To the east of Reisterstown is the community of Worthington, located around Greenspring Avenue and Park Heights Avenue (MD-129). To the west of Reisterstown is Liberty Reservoir.

== History ==

===Reister&#x27;s Town===
John Reister purchased a tract of land, which he called &quot;Reister&#x27;s Desire&quot;, along the Conewago Road on March 2, 1758. He built a tavern on the site, providing food, drink and lodging for travelers. Other businesses serving travelers soon followed, creating the settlement known as Reister&#x27;s Town, and eventually Reisterstown. With the purchase in 1763 of another adjoining the original property, Reister began developing both sides of Conewago Road, later renamed Reisterstown Road.

===Franklin Academy===
In 1764, John Reister purchased a three-quarter acre lot, which he named Church Hill, as a site for the community&#x27;s first church, a small building constructed of logs. Funded and built by the Lutheran community, the church was free to all denominations. The building also served as a school house, a secondary function typical of churches at that time.

The town raised money with a public subscription and replaced the log building with a brick school building in 1824, named Franklin Academy in honor of Benjamin Franklin. A cupola was added to the school in 1826. Franklin Academy became the first public high school in the county in 1874 and one of the earliest schools to join the Baltimore County school system.

The former Franklin Academy was converted into a public library in the early 1900s. It still stands beside the Reisterstown Community Cemetery, across the street from the present-day Franklin Middle School. Franklin Academy&#x27;s cupola, known as the Franklin Bell, is in front of Franklin High School.

<text>Rosedale is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Baltimore County, Maryland, United States. The population was 19,257 at the 2010 United States Census.

== History ==
The etymology of Rosedale remains uncertain and lacks definitive documentation. However, according to anecdotal evidence, a fourth-grade class in 1950 was instructed to conduct interviews with local residents regarding the history of the Rosedale community. From their interviews, a possible explanation emerged: A young Englishman had a farm on Hamilton Avenue just above Philadelphia Road. His farm had numerous roses. Since his name was Dale and the roses were so lovely, the townspeople settled on the name of Rosedale.

Rosedale, a community northeast of the city of Baltimore, was a plantation and later farming community, from the time of the first settlers and their slaves, until suburban development began after World War II. Maryland Route 7, which runs through the community, was originally the Philadelphia Road. George Washington traveled it to New York in 1789 where he was inaugurated as the first American president.

In the latter part of the nineteenth century, this area was settled by new waves of immigrants, mostly from Germany and Poland. A 1940 article was written about the 59th wedding anniversary of Charles Schatzschneider and his wife; they had been immigrants who settled in this area. Charles Schatzschneider was born in Germany in 1859 and came at the age of 13 to the United States as a farm laborer. He settled in Rosedale, where he later married. He and his wife raised 15 children. During their lives they saw the area develop from a rather primitive rural community to one with gas and electric lighting, water and sewerage systems and paved streets. New electric trains passed rapidly through the community. When this couple had first come to the area, great three-masted schooners could sail all the way up Back River to the heading.

On 8 March 1909, an African American man named William Ramsey was lynched in the town. The first school, a wooden building with two rooms, was built on the corner of Hamilton Avenue and Philadelphia Road. By 1950 it was used as a fire house and hall.

Beginning in the 1950s, aided by federal subsidies of new highways, new residential development was built in the suburbs of Baltimore and other major cities. Rosedale grew steadily as a residential suburb. Three quarters of the housing units existing in 1990 were built between 1854 and 1979.

<text>Towson () is an unincorporated community and a census-designated place in Baltimore County, Maryland, United States. The population was 59,533 in the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Baltimore County and the second-most populous unincorporated county seat in the United States (after Ellicott City, the seat of nearby Howard County, southwest of Baltimore).

==History==
===1600s===
The first inhabitants of the future Towson and central Baltimore County region were the Susquehannock people, who hunted in the area. Their region included all of Baltimore County, though their primary settlement was farther northeast along the Susquehanna River.

===1700s===
Towson was settled in 1752 when Pennsylvania brothers, William and Thomas Towson, began farming an area of Sater&#x27;s Hill, northeast of the present-day York and Joppa roads. William&#x27;s son, Ezekiel, opened the Towson Hotel to serve the growing number of farmers bringing their produce and livestock to the port of Baltimore. He built the hotel at current-day Shealy Avenue and York Road, near the area&#x27;s main crossroads. The village became known as &quot;Towsontown&quot;.
The property in West Towson came from two land grants: 400-acre Gott&#x27;s Hope in 1719, and Gunner&#x27;s Range in 1706.

In 1790, businessman Capt. Charles Ridgely completed the Hampton Mansion just north of Towsontown, the largest private house in America at the time. The Ridgelys lived there for six generations, until 1948. It is now preserved as the Hampton National Historic Site and open to the public.

===1800s===
Grafton Marsh, a surgeon during the War of 1812, and his brother Josiah Marsh settled their families in a collection of early houses known as Gott&#x27;s Hope that was part of a group along Joppa Road. They consolidated four of the structures into a larger dwelling that they called &quot;Marshmont&quot;. The brothers went into business together as medical practitioners. Neither had any heirs but were joined in practice later by their nephew, Dr. Grafton Marsh Bosley, who eventually inherited the medical practice, the Marshmont compound, and a 140-acre farm. The farm extended west of York Road, south of Joppa Road, north of the Sheppard Pratt Hospital, and east of Woodbine Avenue. In 1869, Bosley and his wife Margaret Nicholson then built a new home in an area of the property known as &quot;Highlands&quot; or &quot;Highland Park&quot;, which they named &quot;Uplands&quot;.

The ratification of the second Maryland Constitution of 1851 provided for the jurisdictional separation of the former Baltimore Town, founded in 1729. Baltimore Town had served as the county seat since 1767, now the City of Baltimore, since its incorporation in 1796–97 by the General Assembly of Maryland. Several tortured sets of negotiations occurred to divide the various assets of the city and the county, such as the downtown courthouse of 1805, the city/county jail of 1801 along the Jones Falls (at East Madison Street) and the almshouse, which was also jointly owned. After a series of elections and referendums, on February 13, 1854, Towson became, by popular vote, the choice of the remaining, now mostly rural, eastern, northern and western portions of the county as the new county seat of Baltimore County.

The Baltimore County Courthouse, still in use by 2015, with its various annexes (and the separate county courts and administrative building), was originally designed by the local city architectural firm of Dixon, Balbirnie and Dixon. It was completed within a year, constructed of limestone and marble donated by the well-known Ridgely family of nearby Hampton Mansion, on land donated by Towson doctor Grafton Marsh Bosley. The courthouse was subsequently enlarged in 1910 through additional designs for north and south wings by well-known and regarded city architects, Baldwin &amp; Pennington. Additional expansions later in 1926 and 1958 eventually created an H-shaped plan for the courthouse. An additional modernistic Baltimore County Courts Building, with room for the new charter government since 1956 and administration of a county executive and county council, plus administrative and executive departments, was erected in 1970–71 across a plaza to the west of the older historic courthouse.

The old Baltimore County Jail was built in 1855, and was later replaced in the 1980s by a new modern Baltimore County Detention Center, north of the town on Kenilworth Drive, with an addition constructed in the 2010s.

From 1850 to 1874, another notable land owner, Amos Matthews, had a farm of that—with the exception of the largely natural parcel where the Kelso Home for Girls (currently Towson YMCA), was later erected —was wholly developed into the neighborhoods of West Towson, Southland Hills and other subdivisions, beginning in the middle 1920s.
During the Civil War, Towson was the scene of two minor engagements. Many local citizens were sympathetic to the Southern Confederate cause, so much so that Ady&#x27;s Hotel (later named the Towson Hotel) and the current site of the 1920s-era Towson Theatre (later the Recher Theatre), flew the Southern flag. The Union Army found it necessary to overtake the town by force on June 2, 1861. During the raid, the Union Army seized weapons from citizens at Ady&#x27;s Hotel. A local paper, in jest, refers to the &quot;strongly fortified and almost impregnable city of Towsontown&quot; and downplays the need for the attack, stating, &quot;the distinguished Straw, with only two hundred and fifty men, has taken a whole city and nearly frightened two old women out of their wits.&quot;

The second engagement took place around July 12, 1864, between Union and Confederate forces. On July 10, 1864, a 135-man Confederate cavalry detachment attacked the Northern Central Railway to the north in nearby Cockeysville, under orders from Gen. Bradley T. Johnson, of Frederick, Maryland. The First and Second Maryland Cavalry, led by Baltimore County native and pre-war member of the Towson Horse Guards, Maj. Harry W. Gilmor, of Glen Ellen, attacked strategic targets throughout Baltimore and Harford counties, including cutting telegraph wires along Harford Road, capturing two trains and a Union general, and destroying a railroad bridge in Joppa, Maryland. Following what became known as Gilmor&#x27;s Raid, the cavalry encamped in Towson overnight at Ady&#x27;s Hotel, where his men rested and Gilmor met with friends.

The next day, a large federal cavalry unit was dispatched from Baltimore to overtake Gilmor&#x27;s forces. Though outnumbered by more than two to one, the Confederate cavalry attacked the federal unit, breaking the federal unit and chasing them down York Road to around current-day Woodbourne Avenue, within Baltimore city limits. Gilmor&#x27;s forces traveled south along York Road as far south as Govans, before heading west to rejoin Gen. Johnson&#x27;s main force.

Following the war, Gilmor served as the Baltimore City Police Commissioner in the 1870s.

The Towson fire of 1878 destroyed most of the 500 block along the York Turnpike, causing an estimated $38,000 in damage.

During the summer of 1894, the Towson Water Company laid wooden pipes and installed fire hydrants connected to an artesian well near Aigburth Vale. On November 2, 1894, Towson was supplied with electric service through connection with the Mount Washington Electric Light and Power Company.

===1900s===

At the beginning of the century, Towson remained largely a rural community. Land continued to be sold by the acre, rather than as home parcels. Most residences lay within Towson proper: no houses existed west of Central Avenue along Allegheny or Pennsylvania Avenues, and there were only three homes along the West Chesapeake Avenue corridor.

In the 1910s, the Maryland State Normal School (MSNS) (now known as Towson University) was relocated to Towson. The Maryland Legislature had established the MSNS in 1865 as Maryland&#x27;s first teacher-training school, or normal school. The institution officially opened its doors on January 15, 1866, however as time passed enrollment in the school grew exponentially, which rendered the facilities inadequate. In 1910, the General Assembly formed a committee to oversee site selection, budget, and design plans for a new campus. It settled on an site in Towson. The General Assembly financed the $600,000 move in 1912. Construction then began in 1913 on the Administration Building, now known as Stephens Hall. In September 1915, the new campus, comprising Stephens Hall, Newell Hall, and the power plant, began classes. The college underwent numerous name changes, settling on Towson University in 1997.

As the growth of Baltimore&#x27;s suburbs became more pronounced after World War II, considerable office development took place in Towson&#x27;s central core area. Many of the large Victorian and colonial-style residences in the vicinity of the Court House were demolished in the 1980s and 1990s to make way for offices and parking.
In 1839, Epsom Chapel became the first Christian house of worship in Towson, used by various denominations. Due to population growth in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, several churches were built to serve the community, such as Calvary Baptist Church, Immaculate Conception Catholic Church, Trinity Episcopal Church, First Methodist Church, and Towson Presbyterian Church. Epsom Chapel was demolished in 1950 when Goucher College sold a portion of its property for development of the Towson Plaza shopping center, now Towson Town Center. First Methodist Church moved in 1958 to land also acquired from Goucher College, and is now Towson United Methodist Church.

Author Robert Coston, who grew up in the area of Towson now called &quot;Historic East Towson&quot;, recalled in an interview the unique African-American history of that area during the mid-century:
I think that the Towson, Maryland area that I am familiar with differs from other parts of Maryland because of the proximity to one of the largest slave plantations in the country. The Ridgely Plantation which owned all of the property from Baltimore County to Baltimore City and other surrounding areas. ... This was a very unique place of which I have never heard of any equal to it. Every African American school age child in Baltimore County had to attend school at some point at Carver in East Towson. ... I realize now that as a youngster the older African Americans avoided talking about slavery or the nearby Ridgely Plantation because they themselves were not too far removed from slavery itself.

Prior to the passage of the Fair Housing Act of 1968, racially restrictive covenants were used in Towson to exclude African-Americans and other minorities.

===&quot;Ma and Pa&quot; Railroad===

Railroad service began to Towson on April 17, 1882, with construction of the Baltimore &amp; Delta Railway Company, soon renamed the Baltimore &amp; Lehigh Railroad, and later reorganized as the Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad. The &quot;Ma and Pa&quot;, as it was affectionately known locally, formerly operated between Baltimore and York, Pennsylvania, through Towson. Its passenger station was located just west of York Road on Susquehanna Avenue. Passenger service was discontinued on August 31, 1954, and the railroad line through Towson was finally abandoned altogether on June 11, 1958, leaving only the stone abutments where the tracks crossed York Road on a steel girder bridge. One passenger on the last passenger train recalled that many riders came from as far away as Boston and Washington, D.C., to participate in the historic event, along with members of the National Railway Historical Society. Historic Towson, a local group of history buffs, installed a bronze plaque on the west abutment in 1999, commemorating the defunct railroad&#x27;s place in Towson&#x27;s history.

==Shopping and other attractions==
Towson features some of Baltimore County&#x27;s largest shopping centers as well as other popular venues of interest. These include:

Towson Place is a major shopping area near Joppa Road, Goucher Boulevard, and Putty Hill Avenue. Built on the site of the Eudowood Sanatarium, the original Eudowood Plaza shopping center was an open mall anchored by Montgomery Ward. Renovated in the early 1980s to an indoor mall and renamed Towson Marketplace, the location was then redeveloped in 1998 as an open-air collection of big box stores and other stores and restaurants. Towson Place is next to Calvert Hall College High School, a Roman Catholic Lasallian Christian Brothers secondary school which moved in 1960 to its suburban location from its original site, founded 1845 in the city&#x27;s Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood on Cathedral Street at West Mulberry Street.

==Education==
===Colleges and universities===
Towson University is a public school in southern Towson. Its student population is greater than 20,000, making it the second largest institution in the University System of Maryland. TU is home to the largest business school in the state, with 2,500 students. It was founded in 1866 as the Maryland State Normal School for the training of teachers. Originally the school was located at several sites in the city. It underwent several name changes before moving in 1915 to an expansive campus just south of Towson on the west side of York Road. The administration and classroom structure, later named Stephens Hall, has a cupola in red brick with limestone trim in English Tudor/Elizabethan/Jacobethan architecture style, and was by several other similar campus buildings to the northeast in similar style.

Also located in Towson is Goucher College, a small private liberal arts school that was founded in 1885. Goucher was a women&#x27;s college until it went coeducational in 1986. It was established as the Women&#x27;s College of Baltimore, and its founders, pastors John Goucher, who would later become its namesake, and John B. Van Meter were closely affiliated with Methodist Episcopal Church. The school was originally based in Baltimore city and moved to its current campus in Towson in 1953. The old campus in Baltimore, which the school no longer owns or occupies, is now known as Old Goucher and is a registered historic district. The current 287-acre campus of the school in Towson was also notably registered as a historic district and in 2007 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places for its unique and innovative architecture.

===Public schools===

Towson is served by the Baltimore County Public Schools district, and the Baltimore County Board of Education headquarters is also located there. There are three high schools. Towson High School, founded in 1873, was the first secondary school provided. It is the second oldest in the school system, and Towson&#x27;s largest, with its most recent stone structure constructed in 1949. Loch Raven High School dates from 1972. The Carver Center for Arts and Technology is a local magnet school and vocational-technical secondary school in a newly constructed building. It was established in 1984 and known as the Central Technical High School. It was renamed for the African-American scientist George Washington Carver (1864–1943), and to remember the previous Carver High School in Towson. That school had served black residents of the county for several decades in the previously racially segregated public school system before the early 1960s, when the suburban county lagged behind fully integrating after the 1954 landmark &quot;Brown vs. Board of Education&quot; decision by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Towson is served by nine public elementary schools in the school district: Rodgers Forge, Stoneleigh, Riderwood, Hampton, Lutherville Lab, West Towson, Halstead Academy, Pleasant Plains and Cromwell Valley Regional Magnet School of Technology, which serves students from all over Baltimore County. 

Towson is served by two public middle schools, Dumbarton Middle School and Loch Raven Technical Academy. Some students are also zoned to attend Ridgely Middle School in Lutherville further north.

Also located in Towson is Ridge Ruxton School, a special education school serving the central area of Baltimore County, including Reisterstown, Owings Mills, Parkville, Cockeysville, and Hunt Valley.

<text>White Marsh is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Baltimore County, Maryland, United States. The population was 9,513 at the 2010 census. White Marsh is a northeast suburb of Baltimore.

== History ==
In 1965, the largely undeveloped northeast corridor was identified by Baltimore County as the preferred site for intensive development. A town center was proposed to be located west of Belair Road at the planned intersection of White Marsh and Walther Boulevards.

The Harry T. Campbell Sons Corporation owned thousands of acres of land to the east of the planned town center, on both sides of Interstate 95. The land was bought in the 1930s and was being mined of its natural sand and gravel deposits. The Campbell family merged its sand and gravel business with an international building supply company. A new family-owned entity was charged with rejuvenating the family&#x27;s property in northeast Baltimore County, which was covered with deep craters and pits.

In January 1943, the Cowenton Volunteer Fire Company was founded to counter the threat of incendiary bombings from the Axis Powers during the ongoing Second World War. The volunteer fire department, which was renamed the White Marsh Volunteer Fire Company in 2003, currently maintains a fire department and five vehicles, including two fire engines and an ambulance.
In the late 1960s, Nottingham Properties began analyzing the feasibility of a new town in White Marsh. From the first, the intent was to incorporate a variety of land uses and community services, including residential, retail, business, and industrial.

In 1969, a planning analysis of regional growth found development potential in the northeast brought about by the construction of I-95. The county was planning a series of arterial roads traveling in a northeasterly direction from Baltimore County that would pass through the Campbell land. The County agreed to move the planned town center east, to be developed on of the Campbell land.

The plan was for a town center in an area created by a triangle of arterial roads. A mall would be at the center. The density of residential and business development would decline as it moved away from the mall. A residential sector was designated to the north, between Silver Spring Road and the planned White Marsh Boulevard. It would include all residential densities except high-rise. The area east of the town center to I-95 would be for office and research facilities. The Campbell land east of I-95 was slated for future industrial development.

Rezoning of the area was completed in 1970 and 1971. In 1979 the area was formally designated as a town center in the Baltimore County Master Plan.

From 1972 to 1981, the planning and development of the White Marsh Mall occurred, with the Rouse Company as owner and developer on land rented from Nottingham. In July 1973, Sears committed as an anchor store. In 1981, most stores opened. In 1992, Hecht&#x27;s replaced Hutzler&#x27;s. The White Marsh Mall is one of the largest regional malls in the Baltimore area, with five anchor stores and 190 specialty shops in about . Next to the mall&#x27;s property is the third IKEA store built in the United States, the oldest still remaining.

In addition to the Mall, 2,400 residential units have been built in the town center, and of office and research and development space has been built. The General Motors Baltimore Transmission facility was built in White Marsh and operated from 2000 to 2019.

The White Marsh Library opened on January 25, 1988. It is part of the White Marsh Town Center, which includes the White Marsh Mall; the White Marsh Police Station, which opened in November 1987; the Nottingham Post Office, which opened in November 1990; and thousands of square feet of retail, industrial, and office space, which are still being developed.

<text>Chesapeake Beach is a town in Calvert County, Maryland, United States. Its major attractions include the Chesapeake Beach Railway Station, the Chesapeake Beach Rail Trail, a water park, marinas, piers, and charter boat fishing. The town&#x27;s population was recorded as 5,753 in the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Chesapeake Beach is located at (38.695070, -76.536125).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and is water.

The city has grown out from the intersection of Fishing Creek and the Chesapeake Bay. The creek has been dredged to allow pleasure craft, commercial fisherman and a few small US Navy vessels to dock in the city. Fishing Creek is a breeding sanctuary for Crassostrea virginica, as well as Chrysaora chesapeakei.

The southern end of the city remains heavily wooded and is distinguished by the large sandstone cliffs called the Randle Cliffs. These cliffs tower as high as 110 feet above the water and are constantly eroding due to freeze/thaw and wave action. The debris from these cliffs has formed a number of shallow sand bars which makes navigation by boat near the cliffs very difficult and the water very shallow for hundreds of yards into the bay.

Located at the center of town is the Chesapeake Beach Veterans&#x27; Memorial Park. It features a very large American flag and a waterfall fountain.

A boardwalk along the Bay spans from 17th Street, down to the southern terminus of B Street and the northern entrance to Brownies Beach/Bayfront Park.

==Transportation==

The primary method of travel to and from Chesapeake Beach is presently by road, and two state highways currently serve the town. Maryland Route 260 follows Chesapeake Beach Road into the town, providing a direct connection between the town and both Maryland Route 2 and Maryland Route 4. MD 2 leads north to Annapolis and Baltimore, while MD 4 heads northwest to Washington, D.C. Maryland Route 261 is the other highway directly serving the town, following Bayside Road from south to north through Chesapeake Beach and providing connections to other communities along the Chesapeake Bay. Cox Road is unsigned Maryland Route 775, and is a former alignment of MD 260.

==History==

Chesapeake Beach was established as a resort community at the end of the Chesapeake Beach Railway, a short line railroad from Washington, DC. It was the site of many slot machines in the early twentieth century (despite efforts to prohibit them) as part of the &quot;Little Nevada&quot; area of southern Maryland. Between steamer ships from Baltimore and trains from Washington, the weekend population of Chesapeake Beach reached into the 10,000s during the 1920s, until economic depression, and a bad hotel fire, brought an end to the railroad. The construction of the Bay Bridge to the Eastern Shore of Maryland in the 1950s enabled many of the visitors who used to spend their summers in Chesapeake Beach to now spend their time in Ocean City, Maryland instead. A museum at the old railroad station still exists today in Chesapeake Beach with many historic photos and an old passenger car from the railroad. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. In the new millennium a boardwalk and pier, and a new condominium development have risen in Chesapeake Beach. There is also a recreational water park with water slides, a newly opened resort spa hotel, and a seafood restaurant right on the bay. The Herrington Harbour (Rose Haven) marina resort, which was voted by Marina Dock Age magazine as the best marina in the United States, is a few miles north.

Until the 1950s and early 1960s, Chesapeake Beach was segregated by race, as were many other beaches along the Chesapeake Bay at the time. The resort&#x27;s amenities and amusement parks remained segregated until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited racial segregation in public spaces. African-Americans frequented the nearby beaches of Carr&#x27;s Beach and Sparrow&#x27;s Beach. While discriminated against as visitors, African-Americans were essential to the construction and maintenance of the tourist infrastructure, working jobs in rail and retail.

Chesapeake Beach is also host to the United States Naval Research Laboratory Chesapeake Bay Detachment that experiments with various military radar systems and fire suppression technology. Perched atop the sandstone cliffs along the Western Shore of the Chesapeake Bay the lab is able to use their radars against a variety of surface and air targets in the Bay. Nearby Naval Air Station Patuxent River has several aircraft that assist in the Research lab&#x27;s mission.

Hurricane Isabel struck Chesapeake Beach and the adjacent city of North Beach, Maryland in 2003. The storm surge pushed flood waters into both towns, damaging residences and businesses in North Beach, and knocking out electrical services for nearly a week.

On June 4, 2008, a tornado struck Chesapeake Beach, damaging many homes in Richfield Station and Bayview Hills.

On April 3, 2019, a large townhouse fire in the Courtyards at Fishing Creek neighborhood resulted in the destruction of 2 rows of townhouses, and the deaths of a woman and her 13-year-old granddaughter.

==Neighborhoods/subdivisions==

==History==
Before the arrival of the railroad, Calvert County was a rural county with few roads and no railroads. It had no factories, and the primary industry was tobacco farming, like most of Southern Maryland before the Civil War.

The Owings family had been present in Maryland since the 18th century in various roles, such as real-estate brokers, merchants, and tradesmen. The family was instrumental in the development of the North Beach/Chesapeake Beach area as a summer resort. It was also instrumental in planning the Chesapeake Beach Railway and utilizing it to ship canned goods out of the county.

Owings was named after Harry P. Owings. The railway station located at the line&#x27;s intersection with Solomons Island Road was originally known as &quot;Friendship&quot;. To avoid confusion with the town of Friendship, located northeast of Owings in Anne Arundel County, the president of the railway, David Moffatt, renamed the station &quot;Owings&quot;. It was also a tribute to Harry P. Owings. Mr. Owings had been a one-time member of the Maryland House of Delegates as a Democrat from 1888 to 1889. He was a local farmer and was interested in the real estate business. The town of Owings was a result of that interest as many residents purchased land in the area which he had subdivided through his real estate business. He also served as a sales agent in the county for lime, fertilizer, coal, and corrugated metal roofs. In August 1900, Harry P. Owings requested the position of station manager in a letter sent from Owings Station and now in the archives of the Chesapeake Bay Railway Museum archives and was granted the position.

Harry P. Owings also owned the &quot;Owings House&quot; located at 9740 Old Solomons Road, which is currently recorded with the Maryland Historical Trust. The house was built in 1850 and later served as a boarding house for county residents visiting Owings. The residents would board their horses in the stables and sleep at the Owings House before boarding the train the following morning. The Owings railway stop was the only one in Calvert County in the early days of the line.

A sawmill that operated in Owings in the early 20th century near Old Solomonds Road has disappeared.

The Maidstone Plantation was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

== Community resources ==
=== Businesses ===
Owings has a single convenience store–filling station, two childcare centers, at least one church, and a handful of other small businesses clustered around its center. A medical office building with a now-closed pharmacy is at the southeast corner of the Route 2 and Route 260 intersection. A small industrial site has a concrete provider and an automotive shop. There is a funeral home near the southern edge of the CDP.

=== Public services ===
The Owings Post Office is located at 9440 Old Solomon&#x27;s Island Road approximately south of the town center. Windy Hill Elementary and Windy Hill Middle School are located at the eastern edge of the CDP on a contiguous campus.

Hutchins Pond is a public pond located within the boundaries of the CDP off of Mount Harmony Lane. It was donated by the Hutchins family. It is managed by the Calvert Nature Society and stocked with trouts by the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.

Owings has a Boys &amp; Girls Club affiliate, the Owings Outlaws, with teams participating in football and basketball.

Housing subdivisions include Cabin Branch, Cross Point, Grover&#x27;s Summit (1998), Sycamore Ridge (1989), the three Quince Views, Arbor Greene, Fairview and Amber Woods.

==History==

Prince Frederick has served as the county seat of Calvert County since 1722, when officials chose a plot of land known as &quot;Williams&#x27; Old Field&quot; as the spot for the new county courthouse. (Contemporary references to the piece of land include an upscale dining restaurant named Old Field Inn, and a street in Prince Frederick named &quot;Old Field Lane.&quot;) The original courthouse was finally completed in 1732. The town was most likely named for George II&#x27;s son Frederick, who was Prince of Wales during the time of the town&#x27;s original conception.

In the War of 1812, Commodore Joshua Barney&#x27;s Chesapeake Bay Flotilla found refuge from the advancing British in St. Leonard&#x27;s Creek, several miles south of Prince Frederick, in June 1814. While laying siege to Barney&#x27;s force, the British under the command of Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane plundered and destroyed the area nearby, including burning the town of Prince Frederick.

In 1882, Prince Frederick burned a second time, when a massive fire destroyed virtually the entire town and its courthouse. A new courthouse was erected on the same spot, and remains the center of Calvert County&#x27;s government to this day.

In the 1960s, Albert Irvin Cassell, a prominent mid-twentieth-century African-American architect in Washington, D.C., sought to develop Chesapeake Heights on the Bay, a summer resort community for African-Americans. The project was to feature houses, a motel, shopping centers, a pier, a marina, beaches, and a clubhouse fronting the Chesapeake Bay. Roads and a few homes were built by 1969, but the project ended with Cassell&#x27;s death in that same year.

In 1984, Prince Frederick was named one of seven &quot;town centers&quot; by Calvert County&#x27;s government. The town center designation meant that while Prince Frederick was still not formally incorporated, special zoning regulations would be enacted and boundaries would be established so new growth would be centered around the existing commercial and residential districts. This was done in order to take advantage of existing infrastructure and discourage poorly planned urban sprawl. Prince Frederick&#x27;s town center status also meant the creation of special architectural review boards who would encourage theme and unity of new buildings built within the town center.

Linden was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

On April 28, 2002, an F4 tornado passed just south of Prince Frederick, killing one person. The same tornado had also devastated the downtown business district of La Plata in neighboring Charles County.

==Transportation==
Solomons Island Road is the major north–south artery through Prince Frederick and carries two Maryland Route designations: Maryland Route 2, which runs from Baltimore to Solomons, and Maryland Route 4, an extension of Pennsylvania Avenue from Washington, D.C., which continues past Solomons over the
Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge across the Patuxent River to St. Mary&#x27;s County. Route 4 was dualized in the mid-1970s, and commuter buses run on it to Washington. Routes 2 and 4 join north of Prince Frederick near Sunderland. Route 2 from there north is only a two-lane road to Annapolis.

In 2009, a portion of Route 2–4 in Prince Frederick was widened to three lanes in each direction.

Maryland Route 231 (Hallowing Point Road) intersects Solomons Island Road and runs west, ultimately crossing the Patuxent River and continuing into Charles County. Maryland Route 402 (Dares Beach Road) leads east to Dares Beach on Chesapeake Bay. Maryland Route 765 serves as Prince Frederick&#x27;s Main Street and provides access to the courthouse and government center.

In the mid-1990s, a series of new loop roads and side streets were approved in Prince Frederick in order to divert local traffic off Route 2-4 and alleviate thru-traffic congestion. The first of these roads, Prince Frederick Boulevard, has been completed between Maryland Route 231 and Stoakley Road. A second portion of the road, Chesapeake Boulevard, opened in 2010 on the eastern side of Route 2-4 and provides access to the new Calvert Middle School. Additional roads are planned around the southern portions of town.

==Institutions and organizations==

Prince Frederick has its own volunteer fire department and rescue squad. Prince Frederick is served by one hospital, Calvert Memorial Hospital, which moved into its current facility in 1978.

There is one public high school in Prince Frederick, Calvert High School, with the mascot being the Cavaliers. In 2000, the Cavaliers won the Maryland Division 3A high school football championship. Prince Frederick also has a public middle school and public elementary school.

In 2005, the Calvert County branch of the College of Southern Maryland opened its new Prince Frederick campus, replacing the earlier campus at Port Republic.

Several churches and other religious institutions call Prince Frederick home. These include St. John Vianney Catholic Church, St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Trinity United Methodist Church, First Baptist Church of Calvert County, Full Gospel Assembly of God, and the Southern Maryland Islamic Center.

Prince Frederick is Calvert County&#x27;s main commercial and retail hub, as it contains at least five major shopping centers, numerous chain and independent restaurants, three hotels, and Calvert County&#x27;s only movie theater.

While many in the Prince Frederick area commute to jobs all over the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area, there are several small companies based in Prince Frederick itself. On the western side of Prince Frederick, there is a large industrial park which attracted numerous businesses and places of commerce after offering free land sites. One such business is Recorded Books, L.L.C., the largest independent publisher of unabridged audio books in the world.

There are two newspapers circulated in Calvert County - &quot;The Calvert Recorder&quot;, published every Wednesday and Friday, and &quot;The Calvert Gazette&quot;, published every Thursday. A third newspaper, &quot;The Calvert Independent&quot;, went out of business in 2010.

In 2006, the main branch of the Calvert Library moved from its original downtown Prince Frederick location to a new larger facility on Costley Way, named after Russell Costley, a prominent man who was a longtime advocate and trustee of the library.

In June 2010, the Edward T. Hall Aquatics Center opened its doors to the public. The center features an indoor ten-lane, 50-meter pool with a diving well as therapy and leisure pools. Hallowing Point Park is a county-owned recreational area west of Prince Frederick which features tennis courts, athletic fields for baseball, softball, and soccer, and hiking and jogging trails.

Notable places in the Prince Frederick area include Battle Creek Cypress Swamp—a local nature preserve—and the Arthur Storer Planetarium, which is located on the grounds of Calvert High School.

The Calvert County Fair is held every fall at the Calvert County Fairgrounds just outside Prince Frederick. The fair moved from its original location in downtown Prince Frederick in 1994.

Located on the southeastern side of town, there is a very large, triangular retention pond at the site of the Prince Frederick wastewater treatment plant. Final approval for the plant was obtained in December 2000. The plant&#x27;s strange UFO-like appearance—approximately long per side and location in a secluded and heavily wooded area—in satellite imagery on Google Earth has evoked the curiosity of many locals, who have nicknamed the site the &quot;Giant Triangle&quot; and speculated on its purpose.

<text>Solomons, also known as Solomons Island, is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Calvert County, Maryland, United States. The population was 2,368 at the 2010 census, up from 1,536 in 2000. Solomons is a popular weekend destination spot in the Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area.

==Geography==
Solomons is located at the southern tip of Calvert County at (38.336431, −76.464102). It includes Solomons Island and mainland on the north side of the mouth of Patuxent River, where it meets the Chesapeake Bay. It is just across from the U.S. Naval Air Station Patuxent River (on the south side of the mouth of the Patuxent River). The city also included the west and south part of the Dowell Peninsula.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Solomons CDP has a total area of , of which is land and , or 14.76%, is water, consisting mainly of Back Creek, a tidal inlet that extends north from the Patuxent River.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Solomons has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps. Monthly average temperatures on Solomons Island range from 36.7 °F in January to 78.7 °F in July. 

== History ==

=== Early settlers ===
Originally called Bourne&#x27;s Island (1680), then Somervell&#x27;s Island (1740), Solomons takes its name from 19th century Baltimore businessman Isaac Solomon, who established a cannery there shortly after the Civil War. Solomon&#x27;s home still stands on the front of the island.

The area has been inhabited since colonial times.

=== Shipbuilding and maritime activity ===
In the 19th century, shipyards developed to support the island&#x27;s fishing fleet. The Marsh Shipyard built schooners and sloops but became famous for its bugeyes, the forerunner of the skipjack. In the War of 1812, Commodore Joshua Barney&#x27;s flotilla sailed from here to attack British vessels on Chesapeake Bay. The deep, protected harbor has been a busy marine center ever since. &quot;Kronprinzessin Cecilie&quot;, a 1906-built German ocean liner which during World War I was commandeered (and renamed &quot;Mount Vernon&quot; (ID-4508) by the US, was laid up at Solomons in 1920.

=== Supporting the U.S. Navy during World War II ===
During World War II, the island was chosen by the Allied command as the site for Naval Amphibious Training Base Solomons. The lessons learned at Solomons proved invaluable on D-Day, at Tarawa, at Guadalcanal, and in numerous other military operations. Three naval bases were established at the mouth of the Patuxent River. These three facilities made a major contribution to the war effort and brought new jobs to local residents. Between 1942 and 1945, the population of Solomons increased from 263 to more than 2,600. Over 60,000 troops trained at Solomons during the war.

Coincidentally, many of the servicemen who trained at the Solomons base in Maryland were sent to fight in the Solomon Islands in the Pacific Ocean.

Solomons was the site of the following U.S. Navy activities during the war:
* Naval Mine Warfare Test Station, now the Solomons Annex Naval Recreation Center 
* Naval Amphibious Training Base, now Calvert Marine and Harbours Point Park
* Mine Warfare Experimental Station
* Naval Dispensary, at Naval Amphibious Training Base

=== Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge ===
Solomons was a rather isolated boat-building town housing the University of Maryland Chesapeake Biological Laboratory, until 1977 when the Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge was built. The bridge leads from just off Solomons Island proper to St. Mary&#x27;s County and the Patuxent Naval Air Station.

== Tourism ==
The town now welcomes tourists with numerous marinas, seafood restaurants, gift shops, a boardwalk, a sculpture garden, the Calvert Marine Museum where visitors can climb atop a former lighthouse, board harbor cruises, and hear occasional outdoor concerts by famous performers. Solomons also has three major hotels, a U.S. Navy family recreation center, and a church retirement home. St. Peter&#x27;s Chapel is an historic 1889 Carpenter Gothic-style church that is still in use.

The Annmarie Sculpture Garden &amp; Arts Center in Solomons is a Smithsonian-affiliated forested sculpture park where creations of Kenneth Snelson, George Rickey, Arnaldo Pomodoro and other major sculptors are on exhibit. Most sculptures are on loan from the National Gallery of Art or the Hirshhorn Museum. The site is both a family-friendly place with educational activities for children and a host of world-class professional artwork, including pieces by Picasso, Matisse, and Miró; the three were highlights of the 2008 opening exhibit of the new gallery space, the Arts Building. In a traffic circle outside the Arts Building stands a landmark bronze fountain-sculpture made for Annmarie Garden which depicts a Chesapeake Bay waterman standing in a boat while holding oyster-harvesting tongs. During the warm season, water pumped through concealed ductwork emerges and cascades out of the tongs&#x27; jaws and also over a shellfish-sorting riprap on the &quot;Tonger&quot;&#x27;s boat. The fallen water pools around the boat in a map-shaped decorative basin where sometimes visiting children splash their feet. Since 1993, Annmarie Garden has hosted an outdoor national juried arts festival at which typically around 100 traveling artists encamp in display tents for a weekend to sell their wares.

Denton was established in 1781. It was first called Eden Town, for Sir Robert Eden, the last royal governor of Maryland, and over time, Eden Town was shortened to Denton. The town was incorporated in 1802.

The town benefited from trade shipped along the adjacent Choptank River. Shipyards along the river serviced smaller sail and steamships plying their trade on the river, with most traffic flowing down to the larger town of Cambridge. The Choptank was deep enough to pose a formidable barrier to enslaved people fleeing north to freedom. Irish-American abolitionist Hugh Hazlett and a group of escaped slaves were detained near the town in 1858, with a plaque commemorating the event.

The steamship trade began in 1840s and ended in the 1920s. Steamships carried passengers and goods from Denton to Cambridge and other communities on the Chesapeake.

<doc id="116384" wikidata="Q754945" url="?curid=116384" title="Ridgely, Maryland">
<text>Ridgely is a town in Caroline County, Maryland, United States. The population was 1,639 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The town was established on May 13, 1867, by the Maryland and Baltimore Land Association. The land around present day Ridgely was purchased by the Maryland and Baltimore Land Association from Thomas Bell and the Reverend Greenbury W. Ridgely (2 May 1798-16 Aug 1883) . The town was named after the Rev. Greenbury W. Ridgely.

A railroad boom in the 1860s on the Delmarva Peninsula was fueling land speculation. Civil engineer J.J. Sickler from Philadelphia was commissioned to design the town&#x27;s layout. The Land Association began construction and built four buildings, including a railroad station, hotel, and two private residences during the first year. James K. Saulsbury constructed a combined store and residence, now known as the Ridgely House.

During the Land&#x27;s Association&#x27;s first year, it went bankrupt; Ridgely was left unfinished and sparsely populated. Most properties were sold at public auction, and Ridgely began to grow gradually as a result of its location on the railroad line now called the Maryland and Delaware.

Ridgely&#x27;s economy flourished as a result of its local crop production, including strawberries, huckleberries, vegetables, eggs, and poultry. Most crops were processed in Ridgely or sent to various locations on the railroad. As the nation began to rely on highways instead of railroads for transportation and industry began to concentrate in larger urban areas, Ridgely&#x27;s economy declined.

Ridgely became known as the &quot;Strawberry Capital of the World&quot; as a result of its prosperous agricultural business. Every May, Ridgely hosts the Strawberry Festival to celebrate its past. A Ridgely Historical Society was created in 2005 for the same purpose.

In March 2024, the town suspended with pay its entire police force of six officers for an as yet unknown reason. Shortly thereafter, the town signed an interim agreement with Caroline County Sheriff&#x27;s department for policing services. The Maryland State Police also assisted. In May 2024, the town signed a one-year agreement with the county starting July 01, 2024 for police services. There is still no word on what caused the suspensions. In August 2024, the entire police department was exonerated and no criminal charges were being filed. Many citizens want the entire force reinstated.

==Geography==
Ridgely is located at (38.944896, -75.883489).

<text>Manchester is a small incorporated town in northeastern Carroll County, Maryland, United States, located just south of the Pennsylvania state line and north of Baltimore. The population was 4,808 at the 2010 census.

Manchester was incorporated in 1833 and is the second oldest incorporated area in Carroll County after Westminster, which was incorporated in 1818. The town was originally formed as a part of Baltimore County, before the creation of Carroll County in 1837. It is governed by an elected mayor and an elected five-person town council.

Manchester lies in the humid continental climate region, marked by cold and snowy winters but humid and hot summers. This climate is ideal for growing farmed crops in the summer such as tomatoes, sweet corn and squash, leaving much of the outlying area marked with large tracts of farmland. Manchester is a rural commuting town where residents travel to work in the greater Baltimore Metropolitan Area and the greater Washington Metropolitan Area.

==History==

The Town of Manchester, officially incorporated in 1833, was originally known as &quot;Manchester Germantown&quot;. However, the name Germantown referred to a community west of Manchester that was later incorporated with the town. The town was originally laid out in Baltimore County and remained a part of that county until the creation of Carroll County on January 19, 1837.

Prior to European colonization, the Susquehannock people occupied the territory now within the borders of Manchester. At the center of town stands an intersection of what were once two important Native American trails. One part of the trail connected the Potomac and Susquehanna rivers, and the other ran from the Conewago River to the Patapsco River (Hanover, Pennsylvania to Baltimore, Maryland). The latter trail was laid out in 1737 as the first public road in what is now Carroll County by Robert Owings.

The first land grant in the area, a tract of known as &quot;Steven&#x27;s Hope&quot;, was given to Samuel Stevens, and was laid at the intersection of present-day Lineboro Road. The first European settlers were English but later immigration brought people of German descent. There were many early land grants; the first one touching the present confines of town was made in 1758, issued to &quot;German Churche&quot;. In 1765 Captain Richard Richards was granted a tract of of land which was named &quot;New Market&quot;, adjoining the existing land grant of &quot;German Churche&quot;. Richards laid out the town of Manchester, naming it after his home town in England.
From the 18th century until the earliest parts of the 20th century, the primary languages spoken by the residents was German, or Pennsylvania Dutch. The custom of the German residents of making noodles and stringing them on lines outside their homes would give the town the nickname &quot;Noodle Doosey&quot;. Later, Manchester would receive another nickname when the German custom of making ginger cakes brought on &quot;Gingercake Town&quot;. Manchester was also a relatively large cigar manufacturing town, from after the Civil War until around 1930, when the mass production of cigars made the manual method in use in the town less economical.

Manchester was the home of one of the first colleges in Carroll County when, in 1858, Irving College, named after poet Washington Irving, was established by Dr. Ferdinand Dieffenbach. During the Civil War the success of the school was greatly hampered by the death of Dr. Dieffenbach and the low number of young men returning from the front lines. The school changed its name to Irving Institute in 1886 and finally ceased operation by 1893.

During the American Civil War, Manchester was used as a camping area for the Union Sixth Army Corps under General John Sedgwick on July 1, 1863. The next day, the army made its march to the Battle of Gettysburg.

Manchester has had three newspapers. The first, called the &quot;Manchester Gazette&quot;, began publishing weekly in 1870 and ceased in 1872. The second went into print on December 11, 1880, and was called the &quot;Manchester Enterprise&quot;, and in 1888 the &quot;Telephone Messenger&quot; was established.
The official seal of the town of Manchester is a church steeple in the foreground and the likeness of a leaf-less tree in the background with the text &quot;Founded 1765 Incorporated 1834&quot;.

The image of the tree is a representation of a White Oak and is considered the town symbol. The &quot;Lutheran White Oak&quot;, as it has come to be known, is estimated at 320 years old. The large oak became a fixture of the town when, in 1758, King George III granted a charter to German colonists to erect a church near the tree. The town newsletter was named &quot;Oaknotes&quot; as an homage to the large White Oak tree.

Manchester is a typical &quot;Main Street&quot; town that continues expanding to accommodate a growing population. Manchester has its own post office, and home mail delivery is available to most residents. A majority, an estimated 95%, of town residents commute to work. There are no large employers inside the town limits, but there are many small businesses. Manchester is mostly residential buildings, with some restaurants, a bank and other small retail storefronts. A large portion of the businesses are located on or around Main Street which Maryland Route 30 becomes once entering &quot;downtown&quot; Manchester.

<text>New Windsor is a town in Carroll County, Maryland, United States. The population was 1,441 at the 2020 census. The town is known for having been the residence of Abstract Expressionist painter Clyfford Still during the mid to late 20th century. 

==History==
New Windsor was platted in 1797 and originally named Sulphur Springs, for a local spring with water believed to have medicinal properties. It was given its current name in the early 19th century, possibly after its English namesake. The town was originally founded to service and profit from junctures of wagon trails in the area, but would later become a destination in and of itself because of the sulfur springs. To capitalize from the visitors to the springs, the town would become home to a bathhouse and numerous inns, including the 10,000+ square foot Dielman Inn.

New Windsor became home to Calvert College in 1850, to later become the New Windsor College in 1872, and then finally a campus of Blue Ridge College in 1912 until 1937. In the late 1800s, St. Thomas Catholic Church stood at Calvert College. Due to a high level of resentment toward Catholics during the time, the church was wiped from historical records, the church was razed and pieces of the church could be found in town as late as the 2000s. The altar was turned into a workbench and stained glass used for a garage. In the 1930s, then resident Walter Hoke on Springdale Avenue paid local boys to remove headstones of St. Thomas Catholic Church Cemetery. In the 2000s, then owner of 111 Springdale Avenue purchased the cemetery plot from the Roman Catholic Church.

On September 3, 1932, amidst the Great Depression, New Windsor State bank was opened and remains in operation today (Other banks had been opened and located in New Windsor, but are no longer in business). The bank&#x27;s original location on Main Street of New Windsor includes imported marble, a hand painted mural, and a stained glass ceiling. New Windsor State Bank is now NWSB Bank, a division of ACNB Bank of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

Since 1944, it had been headquarters for the international missionary efforts of the Church of the Brethren 
including being a part of the church&#x27;s Heifer Project which became Heifer International. These efforts inspired the international focus of the Peace Corps, whose first director, Sargent Shriver, had roots in the area. However, many operations for the church&#x27;s international efforts are now located elsewhere, and the &quot;upper campus&quot; (located in the former campus of Blue Ridge College) was listed for sale in 2015. This property was sold to Shanghai Yulun Education Group in 2017 and reopened as Springdale Preparatory School.

New Windsor has been claimed as home by two notable American artists: Frederick Dielman and Clyfford Still, whose mansion in town can be visited by reservation.

Much of the town is included in the National Register of Historic Places as the New Windsor Historic District, having been added in 1997. Of specific note are the historic homes Avalon and the Appler-Englar House listed in 1987 and 2001 respectively.

Prior to European colonization, the area that is now Sykesville was used as a hunting ground by Native Americans from the Susquehannock and Lenape nations. By the late 1800s, many Europeans (predominantly from Germany and Scotland) had settled in Sykesville in pursuit of farming and mining.

The land on which Sykesville sits started out as part of the Springfield Estate, a slave plantation owned by wealthy Baltimore shipbuilder William Patterson. In 1803, Patterson&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth, married Napoléon Bonaparte&#x27;s younger brother Jérôme, but when she arrived in Europe as Jérôme&#x27;s bride, Napoléon refused to let Betsy Patterson Bonaparte set foot on land. Napoléon refused the marriage of the two, and would not let Elizabeth set foot on France&#x27;s soil. He was determined that Jerome marry into royalty, and sent Betsy back home. Denied by Napoléon, she was never able to see her husband again, leaving her to raise their son alone in the United States. Upon the death of William in 1824, his son George Patterson inherited the estate. In 1825, George Patterson sold of Springfield Estate to his friend and business associate, James Sykes.

A tract of land on the Howard County side of the Patapsco River contained an old saw and grist mill. In 1830 Sykes replaced it with a newer mill and constructed a five-story stone hotel, to take care of railroad personnel and the tourist trade. In 1831 the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) extended its main line to &quot;Horse Train Stop&quot;, since Sykesville had yet to be named. Other businesses moved into the area, including two general stores, new mills, churches and a post office. In 1832 the town managed to gain control of a barn across the Patapsco River, the dividing line between Carroll and Howard County, but the citizens were forced to return the barn under threat of federal troops. 

Much of the town was destroyed by a flood in 1868, ending a water rights dispute between the Sykesville mill and the Elba Furnace when both were damaged. The town was rebuilt on the Carroll County side of the river.

The town was incorporated in 1904. A weekly newspaper, the &quot;Sykesville Herald&quot;, was founded in 1913 and published regularly until the 1980s.

Taneytown takes its name from Raphael Taney, a recipient of one of the first land grants in the area, though Taney likely never lived in the city that bears his name. U.S. Supreme Court Justice Roger Brooke Taney, author of the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; decision, born in 1777, shares a common ancestor with him, but likely never visited the town or had any connection. When Carroll County was formed on 19 January 1837, Taneytown Hundred and Taneytown were included.

The community&#x27;s proximity to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and its location on the principal road from Gettysburg to Washington, D.C., led to its figuring in the Battle of Gettysburg, although no combat occurred there.

Much of the city was added to the National Register of Historic Places as the Taneytown Historic District in 1986.

There is a Steve Earle song called &quot;Taneytown&quot; on his album &quot;El Corazon&quot;.

==Notable people==
Taneytown was home to Fr. Demetrius Augustine Gallitzin, Catholic priest, missionary, and Russian prince during the late 18th century.

Taneytown was the headquarters of Union Army General George Meade for a period during the American Civil War. Fellow Civil War general Jacob G. Lauman was born in Taneytown.

Congressman Joseph A. Goulden of New York was from a family with a house in Taneytown, where he usually stayed during the summer. Goulden was present in Gettysburg when Abraham Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address, and Goulden heard the speech in person.

Actor Fred Gwynne, star of TV&#x27;s &quot;The Munsters&quot;, died in Taneytown on July 2, 1993, after he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

Explorer Rogers Birnie was born in Taneytown in 1851. Shortly after his birth his family moved to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="116391" wikidata="Q755018" url="?curid=116391" title="Westminster, Maryland">
<text>Westminster is a city in and the county seat of Carroll County, Maryland, United States. The city&#x27;s population was 19,960 at the 2020 census. Westminster is an outlying community in the Baltimore metropolitan area, which is part of the greater Washington–Baltimore combined statistical area.

==History==
William Winchester (1706-1790) purchased approximately 167 acres of land in the area in 1754, which became known as White&#x27;s Level and later the town of Winchester. In 1768, The Maryland General Assembly changed the name of the town to Westminster to avoid confusion with Winchester, Virginia.

On June 28, 1863, the Civil War skirmish of Corbit&#x27;s Charge was fought in the streets of Westminster, when two companies of Delaware cavalry attacked a much larger Confederate force under General J. E. B. Stuart; Stuart&#x27;s forces were thus delayed in arriving at the Battle of Gettysburg.

In April 1865, Joseph Shaw, editor for the Western Maryland Democrat, had his presses wrecked and his business destroyed, and was subsequently beaten and stabbed to death by four men in Westminster, allegedly because of an anti-Lincoln editorial that was published the week before the actual assassination. In a later trial at the Westminster Court House the four men were acquitted; the reason cited was &quot;self-defense&quot;.

Since 1868, Westminster has held an annual Memorial Day parade, which is one of the longest continuously running Memorial Day parades in the country.

Just north of Westminster is the farm at which Whittaker Chambers hid the so-called &quot;Pumpkin Papers.&quot;

A historic marker states that Westminster was the first place in the nation to offer Rural Free Delivery postal service.

On March 10, 2006, members of the Westboro Baptist Church picketed the funeral of Matthew A. Snyder, who had been killed in the Iraq War, at St. John Catholic Church in Westminster. Snyder&#x27;s father sued the church for violating his privacy; the United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of the church on free speech grounds in &quot;Snyder v. Phelps&quot;.

On June 26, 2015, the city of Westminster lit the Westminster Fiber Network, the first community-wide gigabit fiber to the premise network in the Mid-Atlantic region. The city partnered with Ting Inc., a subsidiary of Tucows, to light the network and provide gigabit services.

==Geography==
Westminster is located at (39.576551, −77.000120). Westminster is approximately driving distance northwest of Baltimore and driving distance southwest of York, Pennsylvania.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Westminster has access to two water reservoirs at present, Liberty and Piney Run; the county has also proposed a Union Mills Reservoir and Gillis Falls Reservoir.

===Climate===
Westminster lies in the humid subtropical climate zone bordering on a humid continental climate, with hot and humid summers and cool winters with highly variable seasonal snowfall. Due to its elevation and distance from the Chesapeake Bay and Baltimore&#x27;s urban heat island, temperatures in Westminster are often lower than in Baltimore, especially at night.

===Tornado activity===
Westminster&#x27;s historical tornado activity is slightly above the Maryland state average and 38% greater than the overall U.S. average. On April 15, 1952, an F3 tornado (which has wind speeds of 158–206 mph) hit 15.5 miles from the city center, injuring four people and causing between $500,000 and $5,000,000 in damages. On July 19, 1996, an F3 tornado struck 5.5 miles away from the Westminster city center, injuring three people and causing $5 million in damages. On April 16, 2011, a tornado touched down around 8:00 pm EST. Shortly after sunrise on February 7, 2020, an EF1 tornado crossed directly over downtown, heading parallel to Maryland 27 northward on the west side. This damaged siding and shingles on multiple structures and brought down several trees. Schools across much of the county took shelter due to the tornado warning.

==Education==
The Carroll County Public Schools (CCPS) system enrolls over 28,000 students, which makes it the ninth largest school system in the state of Maryland. In Carroll County there are seven comprehensive high schools as well as two career and technology centers and an alternative school, The Gateway School. Students in grades 9 through 12 attend one of seven Carroll County high schools. Carroll County has 23 elementary schools and 9 middle schools. In the city of Westminster, there are two high schools, two middle schools and three elementary schools.

Westminster is home to McDaniel College, the Civil Air Patrol&#x27;s National Honor Guard Academy, and Dream Flight School, an institution providing flight lessons at the local airport.

==Transportation==

The main method of travel to and from Westminster is by road and four primary highways serve the city. The most prominent of these is Maryland Route 140, which follows an east-southeast to west-northwest alignment across the area. To the southeast, MD 140 connects to Baltimore, while northwestward, it passes through Taneytown on its way to Emmitsburg. Maryland Route 97 is the next most important highway serving the city, providing the most direct route southward towards Washington, D.C. Two other primary highways, Maryland Route 27 and Maryland Route 31 provide connections to other towns in the area.

Due to long-standing opposition to mass transit from local residents and politicians, there is no inter-county bus or rail transit linking Westminster to Baltimore County. A resolution passed by the Carroll County Board of Commissioners prohibits the Carroll Transit System from offering bus services into or out of the county.

<text>Chesapeake City is a town in Cecil County, Maryland, United States. The population was 736 at the 2020 census.

The town was originally named by Bohemian colonist Augustine Herman the Village of Bohemia — or Bohemia Manor — but the name was changed in 1839 after the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal (C&amp;D Canal) was built in 1829. Today, the town contains numerous old homes from that era that have been converted into bed and breakfasts, restaurants and the local historical museum.

== History ==

The town was separated into north and south sections when the C&amp;D Canal was built through the middle of the town. The two were connected by a drawbridge until 1942 when that was destroyed by a freighter that struck it. The current bridge opened in 1949.

The new bridge had to be tall enough to allow supertankers to pass beneath it, resulting in a structure so high and long that cars no longer went into the city to cross the canal. Business declined for decades thereafter.

Around 1911, members of the Ukrainian community bought farmland at the edge of Chesapeake City and established homes here. They worked on the canal when it expanded in the 1920s and farmed as they brought their traditions and culture to the top of the Eastern Shore of Maryland. In 1911, the Ukrainian Catholic Church announced plans for a church and an orphanage. St. Basil&#x27;s Ukrainian Church opened a few years later and prior to World War I the St. Basil Orphanage on a hilltop alongside the C &amp; D Canal was caring for children. The orphanage maintained by the Sisters of the Order of St. Basil the Great (O.S.B.M) operated until the 1970s. The church continues to serve the spiritual needs of the community with regular services.,

Chesapeake City is the location of the Old Lock Pump House of the C&amp;D Canal, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. The South Chesapeake City Historic District was listed in 1974.

In the late 20th century, Chesapeake City was the home of one of the world&#x27;s most important thoroughbred stud farms, Windfields Farm.

<text>Elkton is a town in and the county seat of Cecil County, Maryland, United States. The population was 15,776 at the 2020 census, up from 15,443 in 2010. It was formerly called Head of Elk because it sits at the head of navigation on the Elk River, one of the five tributary rivers that flow into the north of the Chesapeake Bay, east of the Susquehanna River and North East River, and north of the Bohemia River, and Sassafras River. 
The town constitutes part of the Delaware Valley (i.e. the Philadelphia metropolitan area).

Elkton was once known as the Gretna Green of the East of the US because of its popularity as a place for eloping couples to marry.

==History==

The town was founded by Swedish mariners and fishermen from Fort Casimir who settled the area in 1694. They called their settlement Head of Elk, as it was the head of navigation of the Elk River.

The town saw several actions during the American Revolutionary War. On August 25, 1777, Sir William Howe&#x27;s Anglo-German army (13,000 British soldiers and 5,000 Germans) landed on the Elk River and marched 11 miles north to Head of Elk. Howe soon advanced to the short and victorious campaign of the Brandywine, and thence to the capture of Philadelphia. On March 8, 1781, the Marquis de Lafayette embarked his troops there to attempt a capture of Benedict Arnold. Returning on April 9, he began his overland march to Virginia. George Washington and Rochambeau with their combined forces stopped in Elkton on September 6–7, 1781, on their way to Yorktown.

In 1787, the town was incorporated as Elkton. By 1880, the population was 1,752.

The landmark historic home, Holly Hall was built by James Sewall in the 1810s and quickly became a regional seat for important dignitaries and local politics.

When northern states began to pass more restrictive marriage laws in the early 20th century, Maryland did not. As a result, a number of Maryland towns near borders with other states became known as places to get married quickly and without many restrictions, or &quot;Gretna Greens&quot;. Elkton, being the northeastern most county seat in Maryland (and thus closer to Philadelphia, New York, and New England), was particularly popular. It was a notorious Gretna Green for years; in its heyday, in the 1920s and 1930s, it was &quot;the elopement capital of the East Coast&quot; and thousands of marriages were performed there each year. While some of the marriages obtained in Elkton were of celebrities or celebrities-to-be (Cornel Wilde, Joan Fontaine, Debbie Reynolds, Martha Raye, John and Martha Mitchell, Willie Mays, and Pat Robertson all got married in Elkton), the overall tawdry flavor grew to be too much for the state. 

A 48-hour waiting period was imposed in 1938, but Elkton continued to be a place to marry, and especially elope; it simply took longer. The year before the Maryland Legislature enacted a 48-hour waiting period, the marriage bureau in the town of about 3,300 people issued 16,054 licenses. That number slumped to 4,532 in 1939. Still, the marrying ministers found all sorts of loopholes that allowed the business to continue for decades. The waiting period could be lifted, for instance, if the &quot;mother was expecting&quot;, or if a young man was preparing to go off to war. In 1942, Elkton had about 14,000 marriages. 

In time, Las Vegas became the new &quot;American Gretna Green&quot;, although hundreds of people still came to Elkton. But an era faded in the northeastern Maryland county seat when the last commercial wedding chapel closed in 2017. 

On December 8, 1963, Pan Am Flight 214 was struck by lightning and crashed near Elkton, taking 81 lives. The crash was listed in the 2005 Guinness World Records as the &quot;Worst Lightning Strike Death Toll.&quot; A small memorial marks the site of the crash, the worst loss of life accident in Maryland. The Boeing 707 had gone down in a cornfield on the eastern edge of the town, and in 1994 a granite memorial was placed at Delancy Road and Wheelhouse Drive. Today the area is a housing development.
