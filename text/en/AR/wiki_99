Unlike most municipalities along Route 22, zoning in Mountainside does not allow for much commercial development adjacent to the freeway. For a one-mile stretch in the town, the eastbound shoulder on the arterial road can be used for peak hour buses. In 2012, the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) regulated the BBS as an exclusive bus lane from 6 to 7:30am. In 2009, NJDOT funded construction of two bus turnouts along the road in nearby Union.

Newark Liberty International Airport is approximately east of Mountainside.

NJ Transit rail service is accessible via Summit station, and it has frequent direct service to New York Penn Station. The station is located around from the center of Mountainside, and Westfield station, which is about away, is also nearby.

<doc id="125786" wikidata="Q1021568" url="?curid=125786" title="New Providence, New Jersey">
<text>New Providence is a borough on the northwestern edge of Union County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is located on the Passaic River, which forms the county boundary with Morris County bordering Chatham Township. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 13,650, an increase of 1,479 (+12.2%) from the 2010 census count of 12,171, which in turn reflected increase of 264 (+2.2%) from the 11,907 counted in the 2000 census.

The borough is home to much of the Murray Hill neighborhood with the remainder lying in neighboring Berkeley Heights. Service on the NJ Transit is available at the New Providence and Murray Hill stations. More than 9% of New Providence&#x27;s land is publicly-owned and protected parkland.

==History==
The written history of New Providence begins in 1664 when James, Duke of York and brother to King Charles II, purchased the land that became known as the Elizabethtown Tract from the Lenape Native Americans. Its first European settlers were members of a Puritan colony established in 1720, which was the first permanent settlement of its type. The settlement was originally called &quot;Turkey&quot; or &quot;Turkey Town&quot;, due to the presence of wild turkeys in the area.

The Presbyterian Church established in 1737 was a focal point for the community, and the lack of serious injuries when the church&#x27;s balcony collapsed in 1759 was deemed to be an example of divine intervention, leading residents to change the area&#x27;s name to New Providence.

According to local tradition, George Washington spent the night in a local home, which still stands to this day. Supposedly, the local stream, Salt Brook, is named for an incident when the salt supply of the colonial village was dumped into the brook to prevent passing British soldiers from taking it. Ironically, the British Army never crossed the Watchung Mountains into this region. Salt Brook winds through town, starting near the eponymous Salt Brook Elementary School.

On April 14, 1794, Springfield Township was formed, which included the present-day township, along with the towns of Summit, New Providence, and Berkeley Heights. Growth continued in the area, and on November 8, 1809, New Providence Township was formed from within Springfield Township. It included what is now Summit, New Providence, and Berkeley Heights. On March 23, 1869, Summit withdrew from the New Providence Township and reincorporated as a township without any other town.

On March 14, 1899, New Providence also withdrew from New Providence Township and was reincorporated as a borough. With &quot;Boroughitis&quot; sweeping across the state, many communities within townships were reverting to small, locally governed communities (mostly reincorporating as boroughs) due to acts of the New Jersey Legislature that made it economically advantageous for communities so do so. New Providence Township was renamed to Berkeley Heights as of November 6, 1951.

The cultivation of roses played an important role in the local economy in the 1900s.

New Providence had long been a semi-dry town, under which there were no bars and no restaurants permitted to sell alcoholic beverages. Retail liquor sales were legal and restaurant-goers may bring their own alcoholic beverages. In 2011, the borough announced that it was considering issuing on-premises liquor licenses, which could bring in as much as $500,000 for each bar granted a license, with plans to use the money raised to pay for improvements to recreation areas. Liquor licenses were granted in 2015 to a pair of restaurants, ending a 100-year period in which the borough had no on-premises liquor licenses.

The 2011 film &quot;Win Win&quot; is set at New Providence High School, having been written by Tom McCarthy and Joe Tiboni, two former students at the school.

<doc id="125787" wikidata="Q1003082" url="?curid=125787" title="Rahway, New Jersey">
<text>Rahway () is a city in southern Union County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. A bedroom community of New York City, it is centrally located in the Rahway Valley region, in the New York metropolitan area. The city is southwest of Manhattan and west of Staten Island.

Built on the navigable Rahway River, it was an industrial and artisanal craft city for much of its history. The city has increasingly reinvented itself in recent years as a diverse regional hub for the arts and biological sciences, with a new global headquarters for Merck &amp; Co.

As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 29,556, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 2,210 (+8.1%) from the 27,346 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn reflected an increase of 846 (+3.2%) from the 26,500 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==
===Indigenous presence===
Rahway and the surrounding area were once the home of the Lenape Native Americans, and tradition states that the city was named after Rahwack (or Ra-wa-rah), a local tribal chief.

===English colonization===
Formal European colonization began in 1664 with the purchase by the English from the Lenape of the Elizabethtown Tract, which encompassed lands from the mouth of the Raritan River and included all of present-day Union County as well as parts of Somerset, Middlesex, Morris and Essex counties. The early settlers of Elizabethtown and Woodbridge were the founders of Rahway which began as outlying acreage and plantations. The Seventeenth Century Clark House is one of the oldest buildings in the state.

By the 18th century, Rahway consisted of four distinct communities: Upper Rahway, Bridge Town (or Lower Rahway), Leesville, and Milton.

===Revolutionary War and the Battle of Spanktown===
Rahway saw action during the American Revolutionary War because of its proximity to Staten Island, Elizabethtown and Perth Amboy. In January 1777, rebels were victorious against the British in the Battle of Spanktown, which resulted in the death of some 100 British troops. The battle was named this after Rahway&#x27;s original name given to it by the first settlers, Spanktown, which is said to have been chosen &quot;because an early settler publicly took his spouse across his knee and chastised her&quot;. Spanktown was mentioned in Revolutionary War military dispatches from January 5, 1777, through March 14, 1782.

The Merchants and Drovers Tavern is located at the corner of St. Georges and Westfield Avenues. The earliest buildings at the site date to 1795 and the property remains one of Rahway&#x27;s most prominent historical landmarks. George Washington visited Rahway during his travel to New York City prior to his presidential inauguration in 1789. A marker across the street from the tavern reads:

:&quot;Here, on April 23, 1789, on his way to New York City, Washington was received by troops from Elizabethtown and Newark. He was entertained at the inn kept by Samuel Smith by gentlemen of the town.&quot;

Following the Revolution, Rahway became the home of the first national mint to create a coin bearing the inscription &quot;E pluribus unum&quot;. A United States Post Office established in Rahway was one of only six in the entire state in 1791.

Various historical place markers in town document Rahway Revolutionary War history.

===Stagecoach era and corporate growth===
Rahway grew due to its location along the major stagecoach and railroad lines between New York City and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The navigable Rahway River, which flows through the city, also aided the city&#x27;s commercial growth.

As immigrants from Britain, Ireland and Germany streamed into what was then Rahway Township in the 1850s, Rahway became incorporated as a city by an act of the State Legislature on April 19, 1858, from portions of Rahway Township in Union and Woodbridge Township in Middlesex County. In 1860, the portion of Rahway that had been part of Middlesex County was transferred to Union. On March 13, 1861, the remainder of Rahway Township became part of Rahway City. Clark Township was formed from portions of the city on March 23, 1864.

The first municipal elections for the mayor and council were conducted on April 19, 1858, and the council held its first meeting on May 3, 1858. The city&#x27;s police department and its initial group of four constables were created at that first council meeting.

The city became home to dozens of major manufacturers, including the Regina Music Box Company, Wheatena, Mershon Bros. and, most importantly, Merck &amp; Co., which was established in Rahway in 1903, when George W. Merck moved his small chemical company to Rahway from New York City.

===Postwar era===
The national decline in industry after World War II led to the closure of most of Rahway&#x27;s major manufacturing facilities (except for Merck) and a general deterioration of the city&#x27;s central business district.

===Revitalization===

Beginning in the late 1990s, the city launched a plan to revitalize the downtown area and authorized the construction of hundreds of new market-rate housing units, a hotel, art galleries and additional retail space.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 4.04 square miles (10.47 km2), including 3.90 square miles (10.09 km2) of land and 0.15 square miles (0.38 km2) of water (3.59%).

Rahway is bordered by the municipalities of Clark to the northwest and Linden to the northeast in Union County; and by Woodbridge Township to the south in Middlesex County.
The Rahway River travels through Rahway, entering from Clark at Rahway River Parkway. The river receives the waters of Robinsons Branch at Elizabeth Avenue between West Grand Avenue and West Main Street, and then receives the waters of the South Branch at East Hazlewood Avenue and Leesville Avenue. The river leaves Rahway at the city limits of Linden and Woodbridge before flowing into the Arthur Kill.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the city include Inman Heights and North Rahway.

===Downtown===
In 2020, downtown Rahway received accolades as a Great Downtown by the American Planning Association: &quot;Downtown Rahway is a great place. It is a place that emphasizes livability, walkability, shopping, food, art, diversity and a destination. Centered in the heart of the bustling City of Rahway, next to the NJ Transit Station, Rahway&#x27;s downtown is the building block for this diverse city.&quot;

In 2019, the Watt Hotel opened across from the train station, with 100 rooms managed by Hilton on the third and fourth floors of a 17-story building, a lobby cocktail lounge and a rooftop terrace with a seasonal bar offering views of the city, river and outwards to the Watchung Mountains.

Beginning in the early 1990s and continuing through the present day, the City of Rahway has rebounded as its downtown began to see the construction of new restaurants, art galleries, market-rate housing and the old Rahway Theatre reopening as the Union County Performing Arts Center. The theater underwent a $6.2-million renovation and expansion project, completed in 2007. As part of the expansion, the facility was purchased by the County of Union for $1.3 million and leased back for $1 a year.

<text>Roselle ( ) is a borough located in Union County in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 22,695, an increase of 1,610 (+7.6%) from the 2010 census count of 21,085, which in turn reflected a decline of 189 (−0.9%) from the 21,274 counted in the 2000 census.

== History ==
On January 19, 1883, the world&#x27;s first electric lighting system employing overhead wires began service in Roselle. It had been built by Thomas Edison to demonstrate that an entire community could be illuminated by electricity. This success encouraged the installation of electric lighting in numerous other villages and cities. The First Presbyterian Church, located on the corner of West 5th Avenue and Chestnut Street, was the first church in the United States to be lit by electricity, and the second in the world after the City Temple church in London.

Roselle was incorporated on December 20, 1894, at the height of the &quot;Boroughitis&quot; phenomenon sweeping through New Jersey at the time, based on the results of a referendum held two days earlier, from portions of Linden. Roselle&#x27;s name is derived from the Roselle Land Improvement Company, which was created in 1866 to lay out a community around the Mulford Station on the Central Railroad of New Jersey. The name &quot;Roselle&quot; is said to have been based on the company&#x27;s founder, John Conklin Rose or from John Pierre Roselle, a friend of the railroad&#x27;s president.

The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. The mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. Roselle is divided into five election districts, referred to as wards. One councilperson is elected from each of the five wards, and one councilperson is elected from the borough at-large. Roselle is one of only two boroughs statewide that use wards (the other is Roselle Park). The borough form of government used by Roselle is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council. A borough administrator, appointed by the borough council, oversees the day-to-day operations of the municipal government.

, the mayor of the Borough of Roselle is Democrat Donald Shaw, whose term of office ends on December 31, 2027. Members of the Roselle Borough Council are Council President Cindy Thomas (Ward 4; D, 2025), Brandon Bernier (Ward 2; D, 2024), John Fortuna (Ward 5; D, 2024), Cynthia Johnson (Ward 3; D, 2026), Isabel Sousa (Ward 1; D, 2026), and Denise Wilkerson (Council-at-Large; D, 2025).

In January 2020, the borough council appointed Isabel Sousa to fill the First Ward seat expiring in December 2020 that had been held by Denise Wilkerson until she resigned from office to take a seat as the at-large councilmember.

Council President Kim Shaw was named to serve as acting mayor in March 2015, after Jamel Holley was named to fill a vacant seat in the New Jersey General Assembly. She served until Dansereau was sworn in on March 11, 2015, making her the first woman to serve as mayor in borough history.

In April 2015, the borough council, based on nominations submitted by the Democratic municipal committee, chose Samuel Bishop to fill the vacant seat in the 5th Ward of Roy Locke, while Reginald W. Atkins was chosen to fill the at-large seat vacated by Christine Dansereau when she was sworn in as mayor. Locke had resigned from office in February 2015, under pressure from then-mayor Jamal Holley who cited Locke&#x27;s frequent absences from council meetings, which Locke attributed to conflicting work and personal responsibilities.

<text>Roselle Park is a borough in Union County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 13,967, an increase of 670 (+5.0%) from the 2010 census count of 13,297, which in turn reflected an increase of 16 (+0.1%) from the 13,281 counted in the 2000 census.

Roselle Park was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 22, 1901, from portions of Union Township. Roselle Park&#x27;s name is derived from the Roselle Land Improvement Company, which was created in 1866 to lay out a community around the Mulford Station on the Central Railroad of New Jersey. The name &quot;Roselle&quot; is said to have been based on the company&#x27;s founder, John Conklin Rose or from John Pierre Roselle, a friend of the railroad&#x27;s president.

==History==
The first known settlement within what is now the borough was built by Samuel Williams in 1700. Galloping Hill Road was continually used by revolutionary war scouts, delivering messages to and from General George Washington and Governor Livingston. Galloping Hill Road also believed to be the route traveled by the British columns en route to the Battle of Connecticut Farms, battling the New Jersey militia the entire way. Son of American general William Crane, was bayoneted and killed by the British near what is now Galloping Hill Road and Colonial Road.

Elizabethtown &amp; Somerville Railroad passed through in 1839, as the first railroad in Northern New Jersey. The first store in the world to be lit by electric light was Stone&#x27;s Store on Westfield Avenue, lit by Thomas Edison&#x27;s carbon filament prototype.

The formation of Roselle Park in 1901 occurred due to a number of grievances based on a lack of sufficient public services, including; lack of a modern sewage system, poor schools, neglected roads, and minimal public safety measures.

In 1907, the first poured concrete building in the world, now the Robert Gordon School, was built in Roselle Park using Edison&#x27;s revolutionary process. Roselle Park was home to the factory and lab of Marconi Wireless Telegraph, and in late 1921 became the site of WDY, the first radio broadcasting station licensed in the state of New Jersey.

The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. The mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. Roselle Park is divided into five election districts, referred to as wards. One councilperson is elected from each ward, and one councilperson is elected from the borough at-large, with two council seats up for election each year for three-year terms of office. Roselle Park is one of only two boroughs statewide that use wards (the other is Roselle). The borough form of government used by Roselle Park is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

==Parks and recreation==
===Roselle Park RVRR rail trail===
Area residents have proposed a pedestrian linear park along the main line of the abandoned Rahway Valley Railroad that would run through Roselle Park. The rail trail would run eastbound from Overlook Medical Center on the edge of downtown Summit and head south through Springfield, Union, over Route 22 to Kenilworth and end at the southwest edge of Roselle Park at the Cranford border. A northern portion of the rail trail on the RVRR main line is under construction as the Summit Park Line, with a footbridge over Morris Avenue installed in October 2022. In parallel, advocates have been pushing for immediate development of the portion of the RVRR Main Line south of Route 22, running past the Galloping Hill Golf Course through Kenilworth and Roselle Park. The New Jersey Department of Transportation, which owns the railbed, has been working to clear it in anticipation of possible future trail use for pedestrians and cyclists.

==Transportation==
===Roads and highways===
, the borough had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality, by Union County and by the New Jersey Department of Transportation.

Route 28 passes through Roselle Park. The Garden State Parkway passes just beyond the western boundary of the borough.

===Public transportation===
NJ Transit provides service on bus routes 58 route with service from Elizabeth to Kenilworth, 94 to Newark and 113 to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York City.

Newark Liberty International Airport is approximately 10 minutes away. Linden Airport, a general aviation facility, is in nearby Linden.

The Roselle Park station offers NJ Transit commuter rail service as part of its Raritan Valley Line service. This was a result of the Aldene Connection that opened in Roselle Park on April 30, 1967, between tracks of the Central Railroad of New Jersey and the Lehigh Valley Railroad, allowing passengers to travel directly to Newark Penn Station and change there for trains to New York Penn Station, rather than riding to Jersey City and taking ferries into Manhattan. In January 2015, New Jersey Transit began Raritan Valley service directly to New York Penn Station through the use of dual-powered diesel and overhead electric ALP-45DP locomotives. Currently the Roselle Park station is located at milepost 16.0 on the Conrail Lehigh Line, on the corner of Chestnut Street and West Lincoln Avenue; the same location as the original Lehigh Valley station. In addition to local travel, one can take the train to Newark or New York and connect to various modes of travel to nearly anywhere in the U.S. and Canada.

===Railroad history===

Roselle Park has a rich railroading heritage. A steam locomotive adorns the borough seal, and the town is very welcoming to railroad enthusiasts.

The Elizabethtown &amp; Somerville railway began laying rails through what would become Roselle Park in 1839. It eventually became the Central Railroad of New Jersey between Jersey City, New Jersey, and Scranton, Pennsylvania. Throughout the years as traffic grew, the line would grow to four main tracks, and also offered trains of Reading Company and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad.

Competition would come as the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company realized that railroading was a more efficient mode of transportation for their coal than a canal system. They formed the Lehigh Valley Railroad, and began building eastward in 1853. By 1872, they had reached Roselle, and formed the subsidiary Newark and Roselle Railway in order to continue building east to the Hudson River.

Roselle Park and Roselle formerly shared a rail station on the CNJ mainline. Passenger service east of Bayonne ended on April 30, 1967. Shuttle service between Bayonne and Cranford continued on until August 1978 but eventually ended, resulting in the closure of the old station on Chestnut Street. The line continued to see operation as an access route to the NJTransit/NJDOT railroad shops at Elizabethport until the mid-1980s. It is currently in service and used, as the Conrail Shared Assets Elizabeth Industrial Track and serves several local industries.

On April 1, 1976, the Lehigh Valley Railroad became part of the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) and became known as the &quot;Lehigh Line&quot;. On June 1, 1999, Conrail was purchased and split between Norfolk Southern (58%) and CSX (42%), and became &quot;shared assets&quot;. Conrail continues to operate the Lehigh Line between Newark and Manville for Norfolk Southern and CSX. In addition to NJ Transit, the line sees anywhere from 35-45 freight trains per day from three railroads; Conrail, Norfolk Southern, and CSX. Canadian Pacific (formerly Delaware and Hudson Railway) utilized trackage rights into Oak Island Yard in Newark until 2012. The track is Norfolk Southern&#x27;s primary access on their northern transcontinental route into and out of the New York City metropolitan area, and is also part of CSX&#x27;s primary north–south corridor between New England and Jacksonville, Florida.

The borough was once served by the Rahway Valley Railroad. The line was exempted in 1991 by then Rahway Valley Railroad controller Delaware Otsego Corporation, and was given to the County of Union. It has remained dormant since. However, beginning in 2004, the Union County Board of Chosen Freeholders began taking steps to reactivate the routes. They named the Morristown and Erie Railway as designated operator and funded the beginning of right-of-way renewal, though the project has faced opposition from residents who incorrectly believed that the line would be used to transport trash. All funding for the project was spent on litigation with opponents. Currently the Morristown and Erie Railway is awaiting further funding to complete the work. , the project was halted and no further steps were being taken to reactivate the railway. As of 2022, local residents have been advocating for conversion to a pedestrian rail trail.

<text>Scotch Plains is a township in Union County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The township is located on a ridge in northern-central New Jersey, within the Raritan Valley and Rahway Valley regions in the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 24,968, an increase of 1,458 (+6.2%) from the 2010 census count of 23,510, which in turn reflected an increase of 778 (+3.4%) from the 22,732 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==

===Native settlement===
The Lenape are the ancestral community indigenous to a large chunk of the Mid-Atlantic region, stretching from Eastern Pennsylvania to the Atlantic Ocean, and from Delaware to Southern New York. Scotch Plains and the Mid-Atlantic region was used by the Lenape and their ancestors for roughly 10,000 years. It is suggested that the Lenape used Scotch Plains as a temporary camp in between the highly-utilized Delaware River and mountains to the West, and the Atlantic Ocean to the East.

=== Chronology and Ways of life ===
From the earliest periods of the Paleo-Indian (10,000-12,000 years ago) to the Archaic Period (4,000-10,000 years ago), there is evidence suggesting a high degree of mobile hunting in the rivers and woods around the Scotch Plains area, with spears, atlatls, and axe heads being found. During the Woodland period (450-4,000 years ago), it was common for communities to make items such as dugout canoes and nets for fishing, two artifacts the Lenape have come to be known for, along with their shelter of choice, the wigwam. During this time they also extensively farmed, moving around to different areas in search of productive land as the seasons progressed.

=== Colonial era ===
The area known as Scotch Plains was first settled by Europeans, including many Scottish Quakers, as early as 1684. The name is said to have come from George Scott, a leader of a group of Scottish settlers. It later served as a stop on the stage coach line between New York City and Philadelphia.

The Lenni Lenape were significantly impacted by the establishment of colonies in the 17th century, with colonists taking up a large majority of land that had once been the living area of the community. In 1778, the US ratified the first treaty with an American Indian tribe, the Treaty of Fort Pitt; the treaty eventually fell apart, causing the inter-cultural relationship to rupture. Today, the Lenni-Lenape, now known as the Delaware Nation, are found in small regions across the US and Canada. A variety of treaties, conflicts, and migration have spread out the community, although a small group continue to live in their ancestral region, hoping to educate and bring to light their claims to the land, including Scotch Plains.

The Ash Swamp in Scotch Plains was the scene of a key action in the Battle of Short Hills, on June 26, 1777, which included skirmishes as Washington&#x27;s forces moved along Rahway Road in Scotch Plains toward the Watchung Mountains. An ancient house in Scotch Plains recalls those skirmishes and with the acreage adjoining the house, presents a vista of that decade, the 1770s. This was the home of Aunt Betty Frazee, whose retort to Lord Cornwallis led the British to find their bread from friendlier bakers in the same battle. The farmstead of Betty and Gershom Frazee is being restored by local organizations.

What is now Scotch Plains was originally incorporated as Fanwood Township on March 6, 1878, by an act of the New Jersey Legislature from portions of Plainfield Township and Westfield Township. Portions of the township were taken to form Fanwood Borough on October 2, 1895. Fanwood Township was renamed as Scotch Plains on March 29, 1917, based on the results of a referendum held that same day.

Scotch Plains was home to the Shady Rest Golf and Country Club, the nation&#x27;s first African-American country club. Its pro, John Shippen, the first African-American golf professional, led the 1892 U.S. Open in the final round before finishing fifth. The Shady Rest clubhouse hosted Cab Calloway and other greats as a local center for African-American culture in the 1920s and 1930s. It is preserved today as the Scotch Hills Municipal course.

<text>Springfield Township is a township in Union County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The township is located on a ridge in northern-central New Jersey, within the Raritan Valley and Rahway Valley regions in the New York metropolitan area. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 17,178, the highest recorded at any decennial census, an increase of 1,361 (+8.6%) from the 2010 census count of 15,817, which in turn reflected an increase of 1,388 (+9.6%) from the 14,429 counted in the 2000 census.

Springfield was formed as a township on April 14, 1794, from portions of Elizabeth Township and Newark Township, while the area was still part of Essex County, and was incorporated as one of New Jersey&#x27;s first 104 townships by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. It became part of the newly formed Union County on March 19, 1857, with portions remaining in Essex County used to create Millburn. Other portions of the township have been taken to form New Providence Township (November 8, 1809, now known as Berkeley Heights), Livingston (February 5, 1813), Summit (March 23, 1869) and Cranford (March 14, 1871). The township&#x27;s name derives from springs and brooks in the area.

The Battle of Springfield was fought here, the last of many battles of the American Revolutionary War to be fought in New Jersey.

Springfield is the home of the Baltusrol Golf Club, which was the host to the 2016 PGA Championship. It has also hosted other golf major championships, including the U.S. Open, held on seven occasions at Baltusrol, most recently in 1993. &quot;Golfweek&quot; magazine ranked Baltusrol as the 36th best in its 2010 rankings of the &quot;Best Classic Courses&quot; in the country.

&quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine ranked Springfield as the 85th best place to live in New Jersey in its 2010 rankings of the &quot;Best Places To Live&quot; in New Jersey.

==History==

Springfield is celebrated as the site of a Battle of Springfield between the American Continental Army and British forces on June 23, 1780. The British, under Hessian General Wilhelm von Knyphausen, advanced from Elizabethtown about 5 o&#x27;clock in the morning. They were opposed by General Nathanael Greene, but owing to the superior number of the enemy he was compelled to evacuate Springfield, which was then burned by the British. During the action the Rev. James Caldwell, chaplain in the New Jersey brigade, is said to have distributed the Watts hymn books from the neighboring Presbyterian Church among the soldiers for wadding, saying at the same time, &quot;Now put Watts into them, boys.&quot; This battle prevented further advance on the part of the British. The American loss was about 15 and that of the British about 150.

Some historical landmarks from the Revolution still stand: the Cannon Ball House, which has since been converted into a museum, was (according to the township&#x27;s official website) &quot;Built circa 1741 and served as a farmhouse at the time of the Revolutionary War. During the Battle of Springfield (June 23, 1780) the British used it as a hospital. ... It was one of only three buildings left standing when all others including the Presbyterian Church where Reverend James Caldwell had taken Watts hymnbooks for rifle wadding, were set on fire. ... In later years the house became a tavern to serve travelers on Morris (Ave) Turnpike. The farmland was later sold off, and it served then as a private residence. The property was acquired by the Springfield Historical Society in 1955. It has become known as The Cannon Ball House because a cannonball was found on the west side embedded in a beam. ... The Cannon Ball House has five revolutionary era rooms, some American Civil War items, early tools, a Battle diorama and a colonial garden. It has just been (1998) renovated to its original appearance and color.&quot;

After being burned down by the British, First Presbyterian Church was rebuilt. A statue of a Continental soldier was erected in 1903 at the site of the smallest state park in New Jersey.

<text>Summit is the northernmost city of Union County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, located within the New York metropolitan area. Situated on a ridge in northern–central New Jersey, the city is located within the Raritan Valley and Rahway Valley regions, and also borders both Essex and Morris counties in the Passaic Valley region. Summit is a commercial hub and commuter town for New York City. As of the 2020 United States census, the city&#x27;s population was 22,719, an increase of 1,262 (+5.9%) from the 2010 census count of 21,457, which in turn reflected an increase of 326 (+1.5%) from the 21,131 counted in the 2000 census.

Originally incorporated as Summit Township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 23, 1869, from portions of New Providence Township (now Berkeley Heights) and Springfield Township, Summit was reincorporated as a city on March 8, 1899.

Possible derivations of Summit&#x27;s name include its location atop the Second Watchung Mountain; the Summit Lodge, the house to which jurist James Kent moved in 1837 and which stands today at 50 Kent Place Boulevard; and to a local sawmill owner who granted passage to the Morris and Essex Railroad for a route to &quot;the summit of the Short Hills&quot;.

==History==
===18th century===
The region in which Summit is located was purchased from Native Americans on October 28, 1664. Summit&#x27;s earliest European settlers came to the area around the year 1710. The original name of Summit was &quot;Turkey Hill&quot; to distinguish it from the area then known as &quot;Turkey&quot; (New Providence&#x27;s original name until 1759). During the American Revolutionary War, Summit was known as &quot;Beacon Hill&quot;, because bonfire beacons were lit on an eastern ridge in Summit to warn the New Jersey militiamen of approaching British troops.

Summit was called the &quot;Heights over Springfield&quot; during the late 18th century and most of the 19th century, and was considered a part of New Providence. During this period, Summit was part of Springfield Township, which eventually broke up into separate municipalities. Eventually, only Summit and New Providence remained joined.

===19th century===
Lord Chancellor James Kent, a Chancellor of New York State and author of &quot;Commentaries on American Law&quot;, retired to this area in 1837 in a house he called &quot;Summit Lodge&quot; (perhaps a namesake of the town) on what is now called Kent Place Boulevard. He lived there until 1847. Today, the lodge is part of a large mansion, at 50 Kent Place Boulevard, opposite Kent Place School.

In 1837, the Morris and Essex Railroad, which became the Delaware Lackawanna and Western Railroad and is now NJ Transit&#x27;s Morris and Essex Lines, was built over what was then called &quot;The Summit&quot; hill, a name later shortened to Summit. The railroad allowed Summit to outgrow neighboring New Providence, which didn&#x27;t have a train station. In 1868, a hotel named &quot;The Summit House&quot; burned beside the railroad. In 1869, Summit and New Providence separated and the Summit area was incorporated as the &quot;Township of Summit&quot;. In the late 19th century, the area began shifting from farmland to wealthy estates; in 1892, renowned architect C. Abbott French cleared away a crest of a &quot;summit ridge&quot;, removing &quot;an impenetrable tangle of wild vines ... and myriads of rattlesnakes&quot;, to build a house with a view of New York City, The Times Building, and the Brooklyn Bridge. The present-day incarnation of Summit, known formally as the City of Summit, was incorporated on April 11, 1899.
During this time, Summit was the home of America&#x27;s &quot;antivice crusader&quot;, Anthony Comstock, who moved there about 1880 and built a house in 1892 at 35 Beekman Road, where he died in 1915.

In the 19th century, Summit served as a nearby getaway spot for wealthy residents of New York City in search of fresh air. Weekenders or summer vacationers would reach Summit by train and relax at large hotels and smaller inns and guest houses. Calvary Episcopal Church was built in 1894–1895; the New York Times called it a &quot;handsome new house of worship&quot;.

===20th century===
Silk weaving, which had thrived as an industry in the late 19th century, declined in the early decades of the 20th. In 1915, there was a strike at the Summit Silk Company on Weaver Street. In the early 20th century, there was much building; in 1909, one report suggested at least 40 residences were being built (some with stables) with costs varying from $4,500 to $45,000, making it &quot;one of the greatest periods of building activity this place, the &quot;Hill City&quot;, has known.&quot;

A new railway was constructed from what was then-called &quot;New Orange&quot;. The Rahway Valley Railroad connected Summit with the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&amp;W). In the early 20th century, both freight and passenger service were offered by this line. (Although in 2009, Union County was exploring the possibility of reactivating the long-dormant line for freight traffic.) A trolley line called the Morris County Traction Company, once ran a passenger trolley through Summit to/from Newark and Morris County, in the early part of the 20th century. Broad Street in Summit was designed and built for the trolley, which is why it is wider and straighter than most streets in the city. Portions of the rails could still be seen on it as late as the 1980s.

Relations between city authorities and businesses have not always been smooth; in 1898, city authorities and the New York and New Jersey Telephone Company had disputes about wires and telephone poles; the city acted and &quot;wires and cables of the company were cut from the poles.&quot; There were disputes between Summit&#x27;s commuters and the Lackawanna railroad about walkways; in one incident in 1905, &quot;a number of passengers seeking to board the 6:35 train found their way barred. They made a united rush, and when the dust cleared away, the door wasn&#x27;t there. It is said the company will put the door back. The commuters say they will remove it as often as it is replaced.&quot;

Following World War II, the city experienced a building boom as living outside New York City and commuting to work became more common and the population of New Jersey grew. At this point, Summit took on its suburban character of tree lined streets and architect-designed houses that it is known for today.

In 1974 there was a lawsuit to split &quot;East Summit&quot; off as its own municipality. Until 1973 the city had been divided into two wards, east and west, by the Erie Lackawanna Railroad tracks. Right before the 1973 municipal election new ward districts where determined that overrode the preexisting geographic boundaries in order to make the two wards roughly equal in population. Following a sweeping Republican victory in the election, the citizens of the eastern portion of the city claimed they had been gerrymandered by the city&#x27;s Republican leadership in mayor Elmer J. Bennett and council president Frank Lehr. The eastern half of the city was more ethnically diverse and with a predominately Democratic voter base. As such Joseph R. Angelo was proclaimed the &quot;Mayor of East Summit&quot; and citizens sued the municipal government. The lawsuit to split the city in half, &quot;Mosely v. Kates&quot;, got as far as the Supreme Court of New Jersey which ultimately ruled in favor of the defendants and the city was kept whole.

In the late 1970s, Summit had a mini-bus system, with three long circular routes through most parts of Summit that were primarily designed to bring commuters to the railroad station downtown. The Velvet Underground played their first paid concert at Summit High School on December 11, 1965. The headlining act for that concert was a local band, The Myddle Class.

===21st century===

More than a dozen Summit residents died in the September 11 terrorist attacks. Many worked in the World Trade Center, and commuted by rail to Hoboken. A few days after the attacks, townspeople assembled on the town green while a minister &quot;called out the names of a dozen residents still unaccounted for after Tuesday&#x27;s attack on the World Trade Center. Others in the crowd of nearly 2,000 called out names he had left out.&quot; A few World Trade Center firms moved to Summit.

Since its incorporation, Summit had been a stronghold of the Republican Party, never having a Democratic mayor, or any democratic members of the city council. This changed in 2001 with the election of Democrat Jordan Glatt to the Summit Common Council as Councilman-At-Large. Glatt would then go on to be elected Summit&#x27;s 27th, and first Democratic, mayor in 2003, marking a shift in the city becoming politically competitive between the two parties.

In 2005, star baseball athlete Willie Wilson and former Summit graduate returned to Summit High School. Wilson said: &quot;To me, Summit is a special place ... It&#x27;s where it all began and I have great memories. This is where I want to help kids and youth baseball, and I want my own son and daughter to come and help me create something here.&quot; During the economic downturn of 2008–2009, Summit was listed as #6 on a list of American communities &quot;likely to be pummeled by the economic crisis.&quot; Crime is generally not bad in the city; the summer 2010 assault of Abelino Mazariego-Torres during a robbery attempt gone awry shocked residents in what one person described as a &quot;very small and very peaceful town.&quot; Several youths were charged in the murder.

Summit has consistently ranked high in NJMonthly&#x27;s biennial Top 100 Towns. In 2019, Summit was ranked the second best place to live.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city had a total area of 6.05 square miles (15.66 km2), including 5.99 square miles (15.52 km2) of land and 0.05 square miles (0.13 km2) of water (0.84%). It is about west of Manhattan.

Springfield Avenue is the city&#x27;s main street.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the city include Brantwood Park and Tall Oaks.

It is bordered to the northeast by Millburn in Essex County, to the northwest by Chatham Borough and Chatham Township, both in Morris County, to the west by New Providence, to the southwest by Berkeley Heights, to the south by Mountainside and to the southeast by Springfield Township.

==Demographics==

The city has long been popular with traders, investment bankers, and money managers, with nearly 20% of Summit&#x27;s residents working in finance and real estate. One report said that Manhattan&#x27;s financial elite prefers living in Summit because of large houses, great schools, and NJ Transit&#x27;s rail link to Manhattan&#x27;s financial district.

===2020 census===
===2010 census===
The 2010 United States census counted 21,457 people, 7,708 households, and 5,519 families in the city. The population density was 3,578.9 per square mile (1,381.8/km2). There were 8,190 housing units at an average density of 1,366.0 per square mile (527.4/km2). The racial makeup was 83.54% (17,926) White, 4.52% (970) Black or African American, 0.14% (30) Native American, 6.38% (1,368) Asian, 0.01% (3) Pacific Islander, 2.84% (610) from other races, and 2.56% (550) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 13.29% (2,851) of the population.

It currently houses Winberie&#x27;s restaurant on the ground floor, and a church, office space, and apartments on the upper floors. It is located at Springfield Avenue and Kent Place Boulevard in downtown Summit.

The Visual Arts Center of New Jersey, on Elm Street diagonally across from the Summit Middle School, is a professionally recognized regional art center with an art school and an exhibition program.

Horseback riding is available at the Watchung stables, located in the Watchung Reservation since the 1930s.

The city supports a program of public art organized by Summit Public Art, a volunteer-based city organization founded in 2002, whose mission is to bring art to public spaces throughout Summit. In 2019, the city was encouraging artists, including singer-songwriters, to perform at local venues in the downtown area, as part of its &quot;Summit Street Sounds&quot; program.

In October 2024, President Russell M. Nelson of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced that Summit would be the site of the Church&#x27;s first temple in New Jersey.

==Parks and recreation==
Renovated and expanded in 2019, the Summit Community Center has two gymnasiums, a senior citizens lounge, a meeting room, a game room, and a small kitchen.

===Local parks and reserves===
*Reeves-Reed Arboretum is a suburban conservancy dedicated to environmental and horticultural education for children and adults and enjoyment of nature through the professional care and preservation of a historic country estate.
*Briant Park, owned by Union County and located in Summit and Springfield Township, covers . It is bordered along its western side by Park Drive, along the east by Shunpike Road and on the northern side by Briant Parkway and Morris Avenue. A brook cuts through the park, and the park is connected via a greenway to Hidden Valley Park in the southeast. There is a pond for ice-skating and fishing, some picnic areas, athletic fields, and a fitness trail.&quot;
*&quot;Hidden Valley Park, owned by Union County, New Jersey and located in the City of Summit and Springfield Township. The park contains of basically undeveloped land that is connected via a greenway along Orchard Street to Briant Park. Hidden Valley Park is bordered along its southern edge by Interstate 78 and along the west by the residential neighborhoods along Baltusrol Road and Morris Avenue.&quot; Its eastern border is adjacent to the now-closed Houdaille Quarry which is now parkland owned by the county.
*Passaic River Parkway, owned by Union County, New Jersey, includes six small park areas along the Passaic River in western Union County (Summit, New Providence, Berkeley Heights). These areas are undeveloped with no facilities, and covers a total of . Area #1 in Summit and New Providence is located between Route 124 and the railroad tracks. The northern area of the park bordered by Morris County, and the southern area is bordered by River Road in Summit.
*Watchung Reservation is a nature reserve and recreation area administered by the Union County Parks Department that is bounded by Summit, Mountainside, Berkeley Heights, Scotch Plains and Springfield Township. The reservation consists mainly of the upper valley of Blue Brook, between the ridges of First Watchung Mountain and Second Watchung Mountain. A dam near the headwaters of the creek creates Lake Surprise.

===Planned rail trail===
As of 2022, construction was underway on the Summit Park Line, a pedestrian linear park that will run from Morris Avenue by the Overlook Medical Center to Briant Park, mostly along a segment of the abandoned Rahway Valley Railroad (RVRR). The park will connect the central business district, another public park, walkways, and nature areas while offering a view of the Manhattan skyline. Approved in December 2020, the park&#x27;s creation is fully funded by foundation grants and individual and corporate donations. Its creation is guided by the non-profit Summit Park Line Foundation. A footbridge over Morris Avenue in Summit was installed in October 2022.

Beyond its Summit portion, area residents have pushed for the full abandoned RVRR Main Line to become a rail trail. Doing so would create a pedestrian linear park along the RVRR main line from Summit to the southwest edge of Roselle Park and provide a protected greenway to connect several county parks akin to the High Line in New York City. The rail trail would run eastbound from the Overlook Medical Center on the edge of downtown Summit as the Summit Park Line and then head south along the old railbed through Springfield, Union, and Kenilworth and ending at the southwest edge of Roselle Park at the Cranford border.

In 2022, as the Summit Park Line proceeds, advocates have also been pushing for immediate development of the RVRR Main Line portion south of Route 22, running southbound past the Galloping Hill Golf Course through Kenilworth and Roselle Park. The New Jersey Department of Transportation, which owns the railbed, has been working to clear its southern end for possible use as a trail. Were the rail trail to expand even farther, beyond the 7.3 mile RVRR Main Line railbed, it could conceivably connect in the Cranford area with the unused Staten Island Rapid Transit line, eventually connecting to a bridge over the Arthur Kill in Linden.

==Government==
===Local government===
Summit operates under the city form of municipal government; one of 15 (of the 564) municipalities statewide that use this form. On April 11, 1899, Summit voters adopted as the Charter of the City of Summit the Statute of 1899 applicable to cities of less than 12,000 population. On December 15, 1987, the New Jersey Legislature enacted a law that repealed the original charter, retaining those sections not covered by general law that were specific to Summit. The charter now specifies that &quot;1: The council may, by referendum, change the term of the councilman at large from a two year term to a four year term. 2: Resolutions adopted by the council do not have to be approved by the mayor. 3: The council pro tempore shall be the acting mayor in the mayor&#x27;s absence due to sickness or other cause. 4: The municipality may appoint an administrator in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S. 40A:9-136. 5: The municipality may adopt an administrative code.&quot;
The mayor is elected by the city for a four-year term and is the city&#x27;s official spokesman and chief elected official. The mayor can appoint various officials, including the chief of police and the board of education. The mayor serves as the chairman of the Board of School Estimate and on various committees, and has the right to speak at common council meetings, but can only vote to break ties in the council. This bully pulpit role is considered the mayor&#x27;s strongest power.
The common council has the chief policy making and administrative oversight role in city government. The council approves all laws and adopts the city budget. The council also oversees the work of city department heads. The council is comprised of three members from Ward I and three members from Ward II plus one member elected at-large. The at-large member serves a two-year term of office, while the six ward members serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with one seat in each ward up for election each year. The council elects from its membership a president and a president pro tem, each serving a one-year term. The president presides at all council meetings, and the president pro tem presides in the president&#x27;s absence. The president pro tem also serves as acting mayor in the absence of the mayor.

, the mayor of Summit is Republican Elizabeth Fagan, whose term of office ends December 31, 2027. Members of the common council are Council President Lisa K. Allen (R, 2025; Second Ward), President Pro Tem Delia Hamlet (R, 2025; First Ward), Jamel Boyer (R, 2026; Second Ward), Andy Minegar (D, 2024; First Ward), Bob Pawlowsk (R, 2026; First Ward), Kevin Smalllwood (R, 2025; At Large) and Greg S. Vartan III (D, 2024; Second Ward).

In February 2021, the common council selected Lisa K. Allen from a list of three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the Second Ward seat expiring in December 2022 that had been held by Stephen Bowman until he resigned from office. Allen served on an interim basis until the November 2021 general election, when she was elected to serve the balance of the term of office.

Summit had been a stronghold of the Republican Party for years. From 1921 to 2001, no Democrats served in elected office and very few ran for office. The real elections occurred in the Republican primary. In 2001, two Democratic candidates were elected to council: Michel Bitritto won in Ward I and Jordan Glatt won the at-large seat. Summit had never elected a Democrat as mayor until 2003, when Jordan Glatt was elected.

In November 2011, Republicans swept all the open seats, with Ellen Dickson elected mayor and Gregory Drummond, Patrick Hurley and Robert Rubino sweeping the three council seats, giving full control of city government back to the Republican party.

Democrats began making inroads in the ensuing years, with the election of Nora Radest, a Democrat, for mayor in 2015, along with two Democratic council members (David Naidu and Richard Sun, who was the youngest-ever elected city official at the age of 24). In November 2018, for the first time in Summit&#x27;s history, Democrats were elected to hold the majority of seats on council.

In November 2019, Susan Hairston was sworn in to the First Ward seat expiring in December 2020 that became vacant following the death of Matthew Gould. In 2020, she was elected to the same seat, becoming the first African-American council member in city history.

In November 2023, Republicans swept the local election, winning the mayoralty and three city council seats, bringing the composition to five Republicans and two Democrats. In this 2023 election, Republican Ward 2 Councilmember Jamel Boyer became the first African American male elected to the city&#x27;s Common Council.
Unril December 2024, Michael F. Rogers was the city administrator of Summit. In this role, he directed day-to-day operations of city government and the city departments.

The Department of Community Services is responsible for engineering, public works and code administration. The engineering division manages city infrastructure such as roads, curbs, sewers, and provide support to the planning and zoning boards. Public works maintains streets, trees, traffic signs, public parks, traffic islands, playgrounds, public buildings, support vehicles, equipment, and has other responsibilities. The city runs a municipal disposal area / solid waste transfer station where recyclables are collected, including bulky trash; residents must have a town-generated sticker on their cars to use this facility. Certain trees require government permission in the form of a permit before being removed. Summit provides for snow plowing of roads, covering all city streets, except for county roads. The city has embarked on a program of &quot;Bringing Art to Public Spaces in Summit&quot;; this program, established in 2002, has placed sculptures at different venues around the town and is supported in part by private donations. The Summit Chamber of Commerce advertises the town on cable television.

In 2018, the city had an average property tax bill of $17,919, the highest in the county, compared to an average bill of $8,767 statewide.

==Real estate and housing==

Summit residential real estate is among the most expensive in the state. The 2018 median home price was $987,583.

As of 2018, the average property tax bill in the city of Summit was $17,930, the 14th highest in the state.

Summit, along with many suburban communities in the United States, adopted a policy of zoning ordinances requiring a single-family house on a large lot and could thereby &quot;exclude any undesirable influences that might erode property values&quot;, a requirement that effectively excluded apartment buildings and multi-family dwellings, and tended to raise the price of houses. One study found that since 1945, the single-family house on a large lot zoning mechanism &quot;has been increasingly used in suburban and rural areas to safeguard particular vested interests.&quot; A reporter from &quot;The New York Times&quot; who is a Summit resident criticized the city for being an &quot;economically, racially and ideologically homogenized populace&quot; with &quot;a growing divide between Summit&#x27;s haves and have-nots.&quot; He elaborated in 2006: &quot;there&#x27;s an ever-diminishing corner of the city akin to the so-called slums of Beverly Hills, where middle-income homeowners like me can take advantage of the schools and services of Summit without the million-dollar price tags so ubiquitous on the other side of the Midtown Direct tracks.&quot; But he preferred the city as a place to raise and educate his children. One developer sued the city in 2005 to comply with New Jersey&#x27;s Fair Housing Act to provide more affordable housing units. The city is working on a &quot;housing master plan&quot; to avoid future lawsuits from developers. In 2011, volunteers with Habitat for Humanity, in conjunction with church groups including St. Teresa of Avila and the Unitarian Church led by Vanessa Southern, constructed affordable housing on Morris Avenue.

Union County, which includes Summit, had the 10th highest property taxes in the nation as of 2010, based on data gathered by the National Taxpayers Union.

<text>Union Township is a township in Union County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. In the 18th century, the area that is now Union was then called Connecticut Farms. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 59,728, an increase of 3,086 (+5.4%) from the 2010 census count of 56,642, which in turn reflected an increase of 2,237 (+4.1%) from the 54,405 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==
Settled in 1667, Union was the third English speaking settlement in New Jersey after Elizabeth and Newark, with the area that is now Union then called Connecticut Farms.

Union Township was the site of the Battle of Connecticut Farms. On June 6, 1780, British troops, led by Hessian General Wilhelm von Knyphausen, boarded boats on Staten Island bound for Elizabeth, New Jersey. At midnight, 5,000 troops started to land. They expected the Continental Army to give little resistance, believing that they were tired of the war and were poorly fed and paid. They also expected the citizens of New Jersey to welcome them. They were wrong on both counts and were unable to make their way to and through the Hobart Gap.

Union Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on November 23, 1808, from portions of Elizabeth Township, while the area was still part of Essex County. It became part of the newly formed Union County on March 19, 1857. Portions of the township have been taken to form Linden Township (March 4, 1861), Roselle Park, (March 22, 1901), Kenilworth (May 13, 1907) and Hillside (April 3, 1913). In 1946, a group of residents pushed for the township&#x27;s name to be changed to &quot;Connecticut Farms&quot;, citing the potential benefits to area residents and businesses from the broad awareness of the historical significance of the name.

The Self-Master Colony was a private experiment in housing the homeless; built on the Hoyt family mansion in Union Township in 1908. The colony was founded by Andress Small Floyd and his wife Lillian, lasting until 1938.

<text>Westfield is a town in Union County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, located southwest of Manhattan. As of the 2020 United States census, the town&#x27;s population was 31,032, an increase of 716 (+2.4%) from the 2010 census count of 30,316, which in turn reflected an increase of 672 (+2.3%) from the 29,644 counted in the 2000 census.

In March 2018, Bloomberg ranked Westfield as the 99th highest-income place in the United States, and the 18th highest-income location in New Jersey. According to a 2014 nationwide survey, Westfield was ranked as the 30th-safest city to live in the United States.

The town has been one of the state&#x27;s highest-income communities. Based on data from the American Community Survey for 2013–2017, Westfield residents had a median household income of $159,923, ranked 8th in the state among municipalities with more than 10,000 residents, more than double the statewide median of $76,475.

==History==

History says that Westfield took its name from the rich &quot;fields west of Elizabeth Town, and hence for over one hundred years went by the name of West Fields.&quot; Town records say that &quot;the settlement of Westfield dates back to the last year (1699) of the seventeenth century. It was the result of the &#x27;Clinker Lot Division.&#x27; Almost immediately after the division emigration from the older parts of the town of Elizabeth began to set towards the interior,—especially to the territory lying between the Rahway river, on the east, and the mountains, on the west. It was not, however, until 1720 that the settlers became numerous enough to constitute a distinct community.&quot;
The old village area, now the downtown district, was settled in 1720 as part of the Elizabethtown Tract.
Westfield was originally formed as a township on January 27, 1794, from portions of Elizabeth Township, while the area was still part of Essex County, and was incorporated on February 21, 1798, as one of New Jersey&#x27;s initial group of 104 townships by an act of the New Jersey Legislature. It became part of the newly formed Union County on March 19, 1857. Portions of the township have been taken to form Rahway Township (February 27, 1804), Plainfield Township (April 5, 1847), Cranford Township (March 14, 1871), Fanwood Township (March 6, 1878; now known as Scotch Plains) and Mountainside (September 25, 1895). The Town of Westfield was incorporated on March 4, 1903, replacing Westfield Township. The name of the town is derived from its location in the western, undeveloped fields of the Elizabethtown tract.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town had a total area of 6.74 square miles (17.46 km2), including 6.72 square miles (17.42 km2) of land and 0.02 square miles (0.05 km2) of water (0.28%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Germantown and Tamaques Reservation Mill.

Six municipalities border the town of Westfield: Mountainside to the north, Springfield Township to the northeast, Garwood and Cranford to the east, Clark to the southeast, and Scotch Plains to the west and southwest.

The upper reaches of the Rahway River Parkway run through the township along tributaries of the Rahway River.

The Robinson&#x27;s Branch of the Rahway River additionally flows through the southern portion of Westfield en route to the Robinson&#x27;s Branch Reservoir, also known as the Clark Reservoir.

It is located about one hour from Manhattan.

=== Library ===
The Westfield Memorial Library was founded in 1873 as the &quot;Every Saturday Book Club&quot; and has evolved over the past century into the Westfield Memorial Library of today. The Library is located in a large, modern, Williamsburg-style building at 550 East Broad Street. The library&#x27;s collection consists of over 250,000 books, two dozen public computers, a wide array of multimedia options, a large youth services area with a vivid mural depicting Westfield history, and multiple tables and carrels for studying. The library offers classes for adults and children, storytimes for children, and computer instruction.

=== Downtown ===
Westfield&#x27;s downtown features many local and national stores and several landmarks that were shown and used in the NBC network television show &quot;Ed&quot; such as the Rialto Theater. There are over 40 restaurants and casual dining establishments throughout the downtown. Downtown is located mostly north of the Westfield train station. The downtown area has a mix of independent stores and boutiques as well as national stores. Over one-third of the retailers and restaurants have existed for 25 years or more.

Downtown Westfield, with over 200 retail establishments and 400 commercial enterprises, is a regional destination in New Jersey. The Downtown Westfield Corporation (DWC) manages the Special Improvement District (SID) area&#x27;s growth and enhancement. The DWC participates in the National Main Street program associated with the National Trust for Historic Preservation. It is funded by a SID assessment on downtown properties and operates as the district&#x27;s management agency. The DWC sponsors marketing efforts and promotions, special event planning, urban design and building improvement projects. The DWC works closely with the town government and volunteer groups to improve the downtown area. In 2004, Westfield won the Great American Main Street Award from the National Trust. In 2010, Westfield was the winner of the America in Bloom contest for communities with a population of 25,001–50,000 against the other two towns entered in their category. Shopping and dining in Westfield attracts citizens from other communities across the state.

Several war memorials (including ones dedicated to the Korean War, World War II, Spanish–American War, and the Vietnam War) are located in a plaza near the downtown. The plaza is also home to the September 11 Memorial Park, which pays special tribute to the residents of Westfield who died in the September 11 terrorist attacks.

Downtown Westfield hosts events and festivals throughout the year. Throughout the summer, jazz groups perform live, outdoors, every Tuesday night. October 2018 saw the first annual AddamsFest, honoring Westfield resident Charles Addams. The festival featured exhibits, lectures, film screenings, and a masquerade ball, among other things. Other festivals include the Spring Fling and FestiFall.

In August 2020, Le Tote announced that Lord &amp; Taylor, the town&#x27;s only department store and the chain&#x27;s only freestanding location in New Jersey, would close as part of a plan to shut down 38 Lord &amp; Taylor store nationwide. Efforts are being made to redevelop the site.

==Parks and recreation==

Parks in the town include:
*Brightwood Park
*Gumbert Park
*Lenape Park, is a wildlife reserve and park that is part of Union County&#x27;s Rahway River Parkway. The park also includes portions of Cranford, Kenilworth and Springfield Township.

Westfield is governed under a special charter granted by an act of the New Jersey Legislature. The town is one of 11 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that operate under special charters. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and an eight-member Town Council, with all positions filled in partisan elections. The mayor is elected directly by the voters at-large to a four-year term of office. The Town Council consists of eight members, with two members elected from each of four wards. Town Council members are elected to serve four-year terms on a staggered basis, with one seat in each ward coming up for election every other year. The Town Council holds meetings every two weeks where it discusses legislation under consideration, and which are open to the public.

, the mayor of Westfield is Democrat Michelle W. &quot;Shelley&quot; Brindle, whose term of office ends on December 31, 2025. Members of the Westfield Town Council are Michael Armento (Ward 2; R, 2027), David M. Contract (Ward 3; D, 2025), Michael J. Dardia (Ward 2; D, 2025), Michal D. Domogala (Ward 3; R, 2027), Linda S. Habgood (Ward 1; D, 2025), David Kiefer (Ward 4; D, 2027), Dawn Mackey (Ward 4; D, 2025), and Todd B. Saunders (Ward 1; R, 2027).

In April 2022, the Town Council selected Emily Root from a list of three alternatives submitted by the Democratic municipal committee to fill the Ward 1 seat expiring in December 2023 that had been held by James Boyes until he resigned from office earlier that month. Root served on an interim basis until the November 2022 general election, when voters then selected her to serve the balance of the original term of office.

<text>Winfield Township (also called Winfield Park) is a township in Union County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 1,423, its lowest decennial census and a decrease of 48 (−3.3%) from the 2010 census count of 1,471, which in turn reflected a decline of 43 (−2.8%) from the 1,514 counted in the 2000 census. The township is the sixth-smallest municipality in the state. Winfield and Linden share the same ZIP Code.

Winfield Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on August 6, 1941, from portions of Clark and Linden, passing over the Governor&#x27;s veto.

==History==

The Winfield Park Mutual Ownership Defense Housing Project (Project No. 28071) is a 700-unit development of 254 buildings that were originally planned and developed by and built for the defense workers of the Kearny, New Jersey, shipyards. This was the last of eight projects undertaken by the Mutual Ownership Defense Housing Division of the Federal Works Agency under the leadership of Colonel Lawrence Westbrook. In earlier stages, Winfield Park was known as the Rahway River Park Project. John T. Rowland served as the project&#x27;s architect. Winfield Park is located almost immediately off of exit 136 of the Garden State Parkway; the municipalities of Cranford, Linden and Clark surround Winfield Township, a governmental entity established to enclose the Winfield Park Project. The Township is bordered on three sides by the Rahway River and Rahway River Park (which adds substantially to the park-like setting envisioned by the planners). Units range in size and type from single-family homes to two-story (plus basement) two- and three-bedroom apartments, better known today as Townhouses; to one-story (plus basement) two-bedroom apartments; and one-bedroom apartments, better known to residents as &quot;bachelors.&quot; Within the town are located an elementary school, two-store shopping center and Senior Citizen Hall, Community Center, Mutual Housing Office, and Garage, Volunteer Fire and Ambulance Squad Building, and Municipal Building/Police Office.

The defense workers of the Kearny Shipyards had advocated early in 1940 for housing to be developed in the northern New Jersey area. These workers were early and vocal supporters of the National Housing for Defense Act of 1940, also known as the Lanham Act, and the mutual housing program. In January, 1941, a report on the housing requirements of the northern New Jersey area indicated that 1000 units were needed. The Defense Housing Coordinator approved the construction of a 300-unit project in the Newark/ Harrison area and a 700-unit project &quot;to be built as a project itself sponsored by a responsible committee of the defense workers who will live in them.&quot; The housing committee had seven working policies that it had developed and that it wanted to apply to the workers&#x27; housing, all of which they believed conformed with the original intentions of the Lanham Act of 1940 (&quot;The housing is to be wherever feasible of a permanent nature, and after the emergency has passed these homes are to be disposed of, and in that way the Government is to recoup the initial investment... and they will be available for permanent homes.&quot; The cost per unit was set at, and not permitted to exceed $3000.00.) and fit well within the mutual housing program.
1. Management of all community affairs, including relations with local government, should be in the hands of the residents of the new project.&lt;br&gt;
2. Each unit should be assessable for its portion of local taxes, and every effort needs to be made &quot;that both houses and householders should be easily and naturally assimilated into the normal scheme of the locality.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
3. The Federal Works Agency (FWA) would provide all streets, sewers, parks, and all other facilities for the project.&lt;br&gt;
4. All dwellings built for civilian defense workers should be sold as a group to local housing corporation as soon as they are completed.&lt;br&gt;
5. All stockholders in the project are, and should be considered as, householders.&lt;br&gt;
6. All management and operating procedures must be carried out under the direction of the local corporation, and not under the direction of the federal government.&lt;br&gt;
7. Housing Corporation must enter into a contract of sale, rather than a rental agreement, with each householder.
Although the committee was completely convinced of the quality of the mutual ownership program itself, they did insist on improvements in the quality of the units over those that had been first designed and built for the Audubon Park project. They especially insisted on the construction of full basements for their new homes.

===Choosing the site===

The first major job that faced the development committee was finding and selecting a suitable site for a 700-unit housing project in northern New Jersey. The United States Housing Authority provided two site selection experts, and the New Jersey State Planning Commission assisted in the site selection process. The final location had to be relatively inexpensive to purchase, near major utility networks for water, gas, electric, and sewer connections, and be in a financially stable host community with underutilized public facilities and services. Major urban areas in northern New Jersey were eliminated early because no plots of land were large enough for the project. The marshy rural areas near the shipyards were also found unacceptable early on. Quickly the committee began focusing its attention on the surrounding suburban communities, which were very popular among its work constituency. Suburban communities lacked financial stability because they lacked the industrial base necessary to keep residential property taxes low. The people of these prospective host communities were also frightened that the new project would be a direct liability rather than an asset for their towns.

Early resistance from potential host communities over financial impact concerns meant that the committee had two choices: to stop the project and wait for the problems to be resolved or push ahead, utilizing the powers granted in the Lanham Act powers to overrule local resistance, but creating a great deal of friction that could potentially affect the project&#x27;s future success. The housing need was so great, though, that the only viable choice was the second one, and they pushed forward to find a site. Consciously attempting to avoid conflict, the committee tried to assure potential host communities that projects built within the mutual ownership program would pay real taxes and not make payments in place of taxes as outlined in the Lanham Act of 1940. They also petitioned the United States Congress to provide additional funds to host communities that would allow them to expand public services and facilities without imposing additional local taxes. But the financial concerns of the residents only served to exacerbate other local fears about the new project. Many defense workers took these other fears very personally.
&quot;Realizing that such an influx of families would engulf them (host community) in a tidal wave of financial difficulty, the municipal government of the various towns considered, stirred up a tremendous opposition to the project and the people to live in it with untrue and unjust charges such as decreased realty values, &#x27;tax exempt properties,&#x27; &#x27;lower class of people,&#x27; and so forth, which are all obviously false. We are a class of people who are gainfully employed, we are law abiding, decent, and respectable, and we are Americans.&quot;
Seven potential host communities were eventually identified and researched. The committee named Union Township, New Jersey as their final choice, but under intense community and [political pressure] this decision was reversed, and Clark, New Jersey was selected as the final site of the project. Colonel Lawrence Westbrook, Special Assistant in the Federal Works Agency with responsibility for the Mutual Ownership Defense Housing Division, wrote the following letter to Union Township opponents of the project, clearly showing his frustration.
&quot;Your letter to Congressmen McLean protesting the location of a proposed defense housing project in Union Township has been referred to this office. This is to advise you that a decision has been made to locate the project in Clark Township. It is desired to make it entirely clear, however, that in reaching this decision this office in no manner agrees that the numerous protests received from various persons and organizations in Union Township were based upon valid premises. We feel certain that if you and the other protesters had been acquainted with all of the facts in the situation, you would not have filed your protest. On the contrary, it is believed that you would have urged the Government to locate the project in your township. Since the project will be undertaken in your immediate neighborhood, you will have ample opportunity to determine whether or not the disadvantages to the community, as claimed by your Mayor, were based upon sound facts.&quot;
Clark Township&#x27;s municipal government had been very desirous of the siting of the project in their township. It had extended an invitation to the Federal Works Agency after the Union Township protests had erupted. However, the reaction of Clark&#x27;s residents to the project indicates that the Township Committee did not have a good understanding of the actual desires of their constituents.

===Clark Township protests===
The residents of Clark—in 1940, a rural community of 350 homes and 1,250 registered voters—were first informed of their municipality&#x27;s selection as the final site of the 700-unit mutual housing project at a town meeting on April 1, 1941. During the meeting, a letter from John Carmody, Federal Works Administrator, was read to the residents, in which he said:
&quot;I am glad to say that a decision has been reached to construct this project in your township, and I want to take this occasion to thank you and your associates on the Township Committee for your intelligent and patriotic attitude.&quot;
But the residents of Clark were not moved by Mr. Carmody&#x27;s supportive words. One local paper reported that
&quot;Joseph Aaron, who came up from his winter home in Florida to attend the session, demanded the ousting of the Township Committee. Several spirited sallies of this type marked the meeting, the largest gathering of its kind ever held in the township.&quot;
The residents of the Township demanded that they be provided with answers to the following questions:
1. Why was the siting of the project in the Township handled so secretly?&lt;br&gt;
2. What guarantees could be given that this project would be permanent in nature?&lt;br&gt;
3. Would Clark have to pick up the cost of maintaining the project after the emergency ends?&lt;br&gt;
4. Who would pay for new schools, equipment, streets, sewers, fire and police protection?&lt;br&gt;
5. Would the Federal Works Agency guarantee in writing that the project will never become a burden to Clark?
Federal Works Agency Special Counsel Colvin, rather than trying to calm the residents&#x27; fears, reminded one and all that the FWA had been empowered by Lanham Act to place a defense housing project anywhere it deemed necessary appropriate, without discussions with residents. During his remarks, he made only brief mention of new public works being provided by the Federal Works Agency, or Title II of the Lanham Act (then being discussed in the US Congress to provide $150 million for the construction and provision of public services and facilities in host communities of defense housing projects). A worker from the Kearny Shipyards also spoke and assured the residents that their new neighbors would be &quot;good people&quot; and that employment at the yards would be stable for at least the &quot;next 10 to 15 years&quot;. Not satisfied by any of this information and feeling betrayed by their own leaders, the residents demanded that an immediate vote be taken against the project. This request was denied. In response, the residents announced the formation of an opposition group, headed by Mr. Arthur de Laski, with the stated goals of seeking the impeachment of all municipal officials and stopping the mutual housing project.

The residents of Clark opposed to Winfield, believed that its sitting within their community would double local taxes. Opposition leaders created elaborate models to show how the additional needs for general services, election, fire and police protection, streets, lighting, water, sanitation, and school costs would quickly double the municipal budget from a yearly total of $33,929 to $66,563. The residents also expressed concern that the project would add approximately 1500 new registered voters to the community: original residents would now be substantially outnumbered in local elections. Additionally, local real estate interests were fearful that the project would flood the local housing market, severely deflating prices after the emergency because of postwar abandonment. Most planned units would not be single-family homes, which many believed would lead to a less stable community and a deterioration of the real estate market. The Union County Parks Department expressed concern about the construction of Winfield— Rahway River Park surrounded the project on three sides—since their own planning program had called for the development of this particularly desirable tract of land with expensive single family homes. The residents continued to be concerned that their new neighbors would be of a lower class of people (although they had been promised that they would be primarily middle-class and would all be white thanks to housing officials not permitting racial integration in most public housing projects of the time), and were annoyed these potential new neighbors would be getting subsidies at their expense.

Lawrence Westbrook believed that Charles Palmer, the Defense Housing Coordinator, had encouraged and supported the formation of the Clark Township opposition group to accomplish his own hidden agenda of centralizing control over the Defense Housing initiative in his hands. Westbrook testified before Congress that Palmer&#x27;s brother-in-law, who lived in northern New Jersey, had secretly led a delegation from Clark to visit Palmer and discuss their concerns about the construction of Winfield Park. Westbrook believed that Palmer, during this meeting, had provided this group with information and advice on how to successfully fight the project.

By late May 1941, the Clark opposition group had successfully organized in advance of municipal elections and replaced all township leaders responsible for bringing the Winfield Park project to Clark. Attention now turned to stop the mutual housing project, or at least transferring most of its costs and impact to someone else. Opposition leaders carefully studied the publicity surrounding the earlier construction of the Audubon Park Mutual Ownership Defense Housing Project just outside Camden, New Jersey. The community, in that case, had followed an unsuccessful attempt to stop the project with building codes and local ordinances. All of these attempted blocks to construction were overturned by courts sympathetic to the powers given to the [FWA] by the Lanham Act. The Clark opposition developed a new and innovative opposition strategy. They would attempt to have the entire Winfield Park Mutual Housing project declared as a separate municipality by the New Jersey State Legislature. As a separate municipality, all costs for public services and facilities would be the responsibility of the residents of Winfield Park and not the residents of Clark. With Winfield Park Township established as a separate municipality, opponents believed the project would be killed because the federal government and potential residents would shy away from the overwhelming expenses and confusing legalities of this new governmental structure. Immediately Westbrook and other project supporters reacted to this strategy by declaring that the opposition was attempting the sabotage the entire national defense program. In defiance, Westbrook declared that he was sure the project would not only survive this attack but would outlive its surrounding communities.

===The creation of Winfield Township===

On June 30, 1941—six days after the construction of Winfield Park had begun—Union County Assemblyman Pascoe presented a bill to the New Jersey General Assembly establishing Winfield Township, New Jersey (originally, the bill called for the establishment of Lindark, New Jersey). After presenting the bill, Pascoe asked for and received a suspension of the rules so that the vote on the bill could follow its first reading. The bill passed the assembly 35 to 20 and was sent immediately on to the New Jersey Senate, which also suspended its rules and voted the bill through 14 to 0 on July 14, 1941. On July 21, 1941, Governor Charles Edison vetoed the bill returning it to the legislature with a letter chastising the members for approving a bill that he believed was counter to the needs of the national defense program. In his view, it was discriminatory towards defense workers; it did not consider the important passage of Title II of the Lanham Act by Congress on June 28, 1941 (another indication that money was only a partial driving force for opposition against Winfield); it created an unprecedented &quot;Federal Island&quot; in the State of New Jersey; it failed to consider that the State&#x27;s constitution would not permit Winfield&#x27;s new residents to elect local government officials until they had resided in the town for at least one year. It ignored that the bill&#x27;s passage violated the New Jersey Constitution&#x27;s specific guidelines concerning public announcements and opening hearings before a bill could be passed. Governor Edison&#x27;s letter was read before the Legislature on July 28, 1941. At the reading&#x27;s conclusion, there was no debate; Assemblyman Pascoe once again asked for a suspension of the rules, and the veto was immediately overturned by a vote of 33 to 24. The bill was immediately sent to the Senate, which suspended its rules on the same afternoon and overturned the Governor&#x27;s veto by a vote of 11 to 5. Thus on July 28, 1941, Winfield Township, New Jersey, was established. Forty Clark Township opposition leaders were present in Trenton, New Jersey on July 28, 1941, and celebrated Winfield&#x27;s establishment in the halls of Capital building.

Winfield Township is a unique municipality in the United States. No other defense housing project had been established as a separate municipality. This unique status also created a number of unique problems. As the &quot;Elizabeth Daily Journal&quot; reported:
&quot;Now Uncle Sam owns a town. Uncle Sam cannot tax himself or vote for himself. The occupants of houses cannot be taxed like a regular homeowner and he has promised them low monthly charges, but with all the benefits of living in town.&quot;
The construction of Winfield continued unabated and the establishment of Winfield Township resulted in the unforeseen effect of permitting the project&#x27;s residents to control their own future. In an article entitled &quot;County Clerk Places Winfield On His List,&quot; a local newspaper reported:
&quot;Winfield has attained a modicum of recognition in these days of rebuffs and snubs among the powers. On all lists of municipalities required for records of official business in the office of County Clerk Henry G. Nulton, it now appears with its rebellious neighbors, Clark and Linden, the other towns. The fact that it is at the bottom of the list, insisted Abraham Grosman, in charge of revising the list, is that it alphabetically falls there, wrestling the last position from Westfield.&quot;
Winfield&#x27;s official history, written in 1976, even begins with the following:
&quot;Winfield, Winfield Park, Winfield Township, is a big title for the &#x27;baby of Union County.&#x27; Most of us use the plain &#x27;Winfield&#x27; address simply because it is the quickest to write. People still say, &#x27;Where&#x27;s that?&#x27; However, after thirty-five years of the same question, we are accustomed to the remark. Sometimes the remarks given to our town, when a person knows where Winfield is, are far harder to swallow than when he is ignorant of its location. Some milder titles are, &#x27;barracks&#x27;, or &#x27;oh, those places.&#x27; We are so tiny, that even state and county cartographers sometimes forget to put us on their maps. Sure, we feel a bit miffed at times, but we then look across our &#x27;Green Acres&#x27; and realize our blessing.&quot;
But this local community pressure also had the positive effect of forcing Winfield&#x27;s residents to work together more closely and form a more tightly knit community than could ever have been anticipated in the original site plan.

===Construction===
The construction of Winfield Park began on June 23, 1941, and was contracted through the MacEvoy Company of Newark, New Jersey, a company that built sections of the Newark subway, the Wanaque Reservoir, and was then working on developing reinforced concrete oil tankers (a project that failed spectacularly, and remnants of which can be still be seen off the coastline of Cape May, New Jersey). The entire Winfield project—254 buildings on 110 acres—eventually required 7500 gallons of paint; 2500 rolls of wallpaper; of lumber; and would employ 1,223 construction workers for five months.

From the start, work did not proceed well. Labor Union disputes stopped construction at least once. The construction work completed by the MacEvoy Company was exceptionally poor—so poor that it attracted the attention of the Truman Committee investigating abuses with the National Defense Program. The investigation would eventually uncover the facts that the Winfield Park project lacked complete architectural or engineering plans and that financial records—at least the few that could be found—were criminally maintained. The project&#x27;s construction was so badly botched that in many of the new buildings, residents discovered that nails had been hammered through water pipes, chimneys still contained the wooden forms used for their construction, roofs leaked, water pipes had never been soldered, floors were buckled, the paintwork was molding, sewer lines and pumps rarely worked, and many roads, sidewalks, and curbs had never been completed. On average, thirty-seven items needed to be repaired and/or replaced in each unit to make it habitable. To accomplish this repair work, the federal government spent an additional $100,000.00 and hired a new contractor, even after the project had officially been declared complete by Westbrook. The final cost for Winfield Park, including Federal Works Agency provided public works, came to $4,392,075.55 or $6,274.00/ unit; the Lanham Act specified a limit of $3,500.00. Continuing investigations uncovered that MacEvoy Company had manipulated bids and committed extensive fraud. MacEvoy rented and sold equipment and supplies to itself at an inflated cost, provided insurance to the government for its own work, employed the son-in-law of one of the government inspectors on the project, and generally milked the Winfield Park Project for everything that it could. Much of this is outlined in a &quot;Life Magazine&quot; article from the November 30, 1942 issue.

===Community life===
The construction difficulties outlined above had a major impact on the early days of Winfield Township. On November 30, 1941, the first 145 families (popularly referred to by township residents today as the &quot;pioneers&quot;) arrived in their new town. A planned parade from Newark, New Jersey never materialized, and the families found themselves moving into barely completed, temporarily assigned units located at the edge of the project to make the units more easily accessible across the mud flats that were supposed to be the town&#x27;s roads, curbs, and sidewalks. Most units were not yet connected to utilities and, in some cases, would not be for several months, even as winter approached. Early residents vividly remember huddling around car radios, the only radios available because of lack of electricity, to hear the news of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. No fire protection was provided, but the government hired a few guards and provided bicycles for &quot;law enforcement&quot;. The school was not yet under construction, and all school-age children were sent to three different school districts. As expected, Winfield&#x27;s neighbors were not warm to the new residents and were even heard to make rude comments as the township&#x27;s residents trudged into their communities, in their mud-covered boots, to make food purchases. Transportation to the Kearny Shipyards was difficult if not impossible when the bus provided by the government broke down. Although one would think things could not be worse, there was an outbreak of polio in Winfield, and the entire town was quarantined. But even with these difficulties, there would soon be far more applicants than available units. Quickly the township&#x27;s population increased, and the new residents were employed not only by the Kearny shipyards but also by Merck &amp; Company, National Pneumatic Company, Lawrence Engineering, and Research Company, American Type Founders Co., American Gas Accumulator, Singer Manufacturing, and many other manufacturers.

The cooperative nature of the town as a mutual housing project, the difficult physical environment of the town during its early days, and the animosity exhibited toward the new residents by their neighbors all served to bind the community together, creating a very strong and vigorous community life. Volunteer Police and Fire departments were quickly established by the residents, as was a volunteer Ambulance Squad and cooperative food store. Community leaders actively sought to discover Winfield&#x27;s residents&#x27; special skills and interests. They utilized this information to organize and promote an astonishing number of clubs and social groups for a community of this size. Cooperative child care was provided in a building built by the community itself. Other community construction projects included a community center and shopping center. The great community event of the early days of Winfield Township was the opening of the town&#x27;s grammar school on September 8, 1943. To increase the speed of repairs of structural deficiencies caused by the MacEvoy Company&#x27;s poor workmanship, the residents of the Winfield participated in a rent strike against the federal government during the first year of occupancy; it was this strike that brought the attention of the Truman Committee to the Winfield Park project. A lasting problem caused by the township&#x27;s unique status was the ill-defined relationship between the newly appointed Township Committee and the Mutual Housing Corporation. Both groups represented the same constituency; one (Mutual Housing) controlling all of the buildings and the other (Township Committee) with taxation authority; conflict and confusion were inevitable.

===After the war===
Winfield Park was the last of the Mutual Ownership Defense Housing Projects to be built and occupied. Because it was opened just before the start of the United States&#x27; involvement in World War II, it was also one of the last housing projects of a permanent nature to be built for the defense housing program. The current residents of Winfield believe that their town was built as temporary housing and are very proud of how well the structures have held up over the past 68 years thanks to their repair efforts; clearly, this grew out of the poor workmanship of the original construction.

The Winfield Park Mutual Housing Corporation purchased the Winfield Park project from the federal government for $1,358,567.21 on December 28, 1950, and entered into a 45-year mortgage bearing a 3% interest rate, which was completed on July 1, 1984. By 1966, a Rutgers University economic study of the town reported that the town had &quot;elements of a cooperative utopia, a feudal manor, and company town (with only one party and one company).&quot; It continued on that:
&quot;One of the apparent by-products of this situation (Town and Corporation being one and the same) is that the normal inter-party rivalry has been replaced by a running battle between the corporation and the township, both of which are elected by the same voters.&quot;
The 1966 study also made another observation about Winfield Park.
&quot;One effect of outside resentment upon Winfield itself was to solidify sentiment among the inhabitants against their neighbors. If their neighbors didn&#x27;t like Winfield, the feeling was definitely mutual. Another effect was to make the early Winfield settlers suspicious of all bureaucracy, including their own elected officers. In this respect, the trying experiences and disillusionment attending the early days of Winfield have made its citizens even more sensitive than usual to rumors respecting changes in the community structures.&quot;
This sensitivity was especially prevalent in the 1960s when residents began to realize that the town&#x27;s property was worth far more than the structures built upon it. Although several experts have presented proposals to Winfield for more efficient and economical use of the property—ranging from selling the entire community and splitting the profits to moving every resident into a single high-rise building and then developing the remaining property for more profitable uses—residents have never considered any of these proposals very seriously. The residents have continually recommitted themselves to the mutual ownership concept.

In August 2001, the entire township celebrated its 60th anniversary with a community picnic and a parade led by Grand Marshal Leona Harriot Burke (1917–2007), who had moved from Kearny, New Jersey to Winfield Park on the first move-in day for new residents on December 1, 1941. Mrs. Burke had also served as the first president of the Winfield Park Volunteer Fire Department&#x27;s Ladies Auxiliary.

===Sociological research===
The residents of Winfield Park were participants during the mid-1940s in a study of social interactions and patterns within public housing projects. This was one of the first studies undertaken by Columbia University Bureau of Applied Social Research under the leadership of sociologist Robert K. Merton. Merton would become one of the most influential sociologists of the 20th century; he was known as the &quot;Father of the focus group&quot; and was the first sociologist to win a National Medal of Science (1994). During his career, Merton coined terms including &quot;self-fulfilling prophecy&quot; (in an article that dealt with Winfield) and &quot;role model&quot;. Other sociologists involved in these studies included Paul Lazarsfeld, Patricia Salter West, and Marie Jahoda. Winfield Park was presented in several published articles by these researchers under the pseudonym &quot;Craftown&quot; and was presented as a homogeneous white middle-income public housing project. In these articles, &quot;Craftown&quot; was often compared and contrasted with &quot;Hilltown,&quot; a racially integrated lower-income public housing project. An aspect of this research beyond interviewing every adult resident of the community was the decision to observe and provide detailed analysis and reports on community organizational meetings taking place during the summer and fall of 1945. In addition to the articles, there was also an unpublished manuscript on this research entitled &quot;Patterns of Social Life: Explorations in the Sociology and Social Psychology of Housing&quot;. When asked in 2002 why this manuscript had not been published, Merton described the period of its writing as being during the Red Scare of the post-war years and his fear, along with those of the other researchers, that the study could have negatively affected Winfield Park. Merton described the mutual housing projects as some of the closest examples of functioning socialist communities within the United States and as such, was one of the primary attractions for studying Winfield Park and its residents.

<text>Allamuchy Township is a township in Warren County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 5,335, an increase of 1,012 (+23.4%) from the 2010 census count of 4,323, which in turn reflected an increase of 446 (+11.5%) from the 3,877 counted in the 2000 census.

Allamuchy Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 4, 1873, from portions of Independence Township. The township&#x27;s name comes from the Native American word &quot;Allamachetey&quot;, meaning &quot;place within the hills&quot;.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 20.27 square miles (52.51 km2), including 19.99 square miles (51.78 km2) of land and 0.28 square miles (0.73 km2) of water (1.39%). The townships southeastern border is formed by the Musconetcong River.

Allamuchy CDP (with a 2010 Census population of 78) and Panther Valley (2010 population of 3,327) are census-designated places and unincorporated communities located within the township. As of the 2000 United States Census, the two CDPs were consolidated as Allamuchy-Panther Valley, which had a 2000 Census population of 3,125.

Other unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Alphano, Long Bridge, Quaker Church, Saxton Falls and Warrenville.

Allamuchy Township borders the municipalities of Frelinghuysen Township, Hackettstown and Independence Township in Warren County; Mount Olive Township in Morris County; and both Byram Township and Green Township in Sussex County.

==History==
Prior to European settlement, what is now Allamuchy Township was inhabited for centuries by the Lenape Native Americans, until they were forced west by 1742. The Bird House Archaeological Site is located within the Township.

===Quaker Settlement===
Acting as a surveyor, John Reading laid out a tract of land for William Penn in 1715 that became the Quaker Settlement, the first non-Native Americans to live in Allamuchy. By 1752, the Society of Friends, or Quakers, established a community in the northeast corner of what is now Allamuchy Township. The settlement was chartered in Kingwood, NJ, and the first Quakers to arrive in Allamuchy brought with them the materials to build their homes. The land controlled by the Quaker Settlement spanned an area not just in Allamuchy, but what is now considered Green Township, NJ as well. This settlement was known as the &quot;Hardwick Friends,&quot; because what is now Allamuchy Township was then a part of Hardwick Township.

In 1735, Quakers selected a plot of land for use as a burying ground with accompanying stone wall and first constructed a wood meeting house in 1752, replacing it in 1764 with a stone building. The Hardwick Meeting sided with a branch of the Society of Friends known as the Hicksites in 1827, an event that compelled many of the Settlement&#x27;s residents to leave for other Quaker communities. On February 2, 1854, the last Quaker meeting took place in the Settlement; it was formally dissolved in 1855. The Friends&#x27; Burying Ground was used until 1918, when its stone wall was repaired and a small monument installed; it was later restored in 1940.

The location of the Quaker meeting house was later used as a public school. There, in Fall 1921, the Quaker Grove School served as an experimental research station for rural education by researchers Fannie W. Dunn and Maria A. Everett from Teachers College, Columbia University. The result of their fieldwork was the book, &quot;Four Years in a County School&quot;, which detailed their findings with regards to the single-teacher model, curriculum, and observations about rural education in general. In 1940, the Township consolidated its four public schools into a single location, the present-day Allamuchy Township School, and the Quaker Grove school reverted to private ownership.

===Grand Estates===
In the late 1700s, John Rutherfurd began construction of his vast home in Allamuchy. Lewis Morris Rutherfurd later occupied the estate, where he took the first telescopic photographs of the Moon from his home at Tranquility Farms in 1865. His son, Rutherfurd Stuyvesant, raised Holstein cattle, Dorset sheep, English pheasants and hunting dogs on the estate, which included a deer preserve. Under Rutherfurd Stuyvesant, the 47-room house was known as the Stuyvesant Mansion, and was decorated with imported and Duncan Phyfe furniture, Ming Dynasty pottery, and 15th and 16th century suits of armor. The Stuyvesant Mansion was last occupied in 1947 and its contents sold in 1951 and 1955. The Mansion was destroyed by fire in September 1959.

Winthrop Rutherfurd commissioned Whitney Warren, architect of Grand Central Terminal, in 1902 to design Rutherfurd Hall. Completed in 1906, the Hall served as a hunting lodge family residence where prominent guests could be entertained, most famously U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt who was a close friend of Winthrop&#x27;s second wife Lucy.

The eponymous family later gave Rutherfurd Hall to the Catholic Church in 1959 after the completion of Interstate 80 brought more traffic and noise to the area. The Church changed the Hall&#x27;s name to Villa Madonna and used it as a convent for an order of nuns for five decades before selling it the town to be used as a museum and community education facility. Now listed on the National Historic Register, Rutherfurd Hall first opened to the public in 2012.

The Panther Ledge Farms estate was owned by Clendenin J. Ryan, former secretary to New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia and politician who later ran an unsuccessful campaign for New Jersey Governor in the 1953 election. Ryan&#x27;s estate acquired this name due to a rock bluff on the property, where local legend holds as the location the last mountain lion was hunted in the state. Panther Ledge Farms featured a private zoo, pheasant hatchery, helicopter, greenhouse, bloodhound kennel, and a collection of paintings Ryan bought from William Randolph Hearst.

In 1972 a left-wing group called the Allamuchy Tribe, led by activists Rennie Davis and Jerry Rubin and funded by ex-Beatle John Lennon, met at the Peter Stuyvesant Farm in Allamuchy to organize protests against the 1972 Republican National Convention. FBI surveillance of the Allamuchy Tribe led to the bureau putting pressure on Lennon to divest from political activity by threatening to deport him.

The governing body is comprised of the Mayor and the four-member Township Council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. The Mayor is elected directly by the voters to a three-year term of office. Council members serve a term of three years, which are staggered so that two seats come up for election in the first two years of a three-year cycle and the mayoral seat is up for direct vote in the third year.

==Government==
===Local government===

Alpha is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of the mayor and the borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. The mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Alpha is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of Alpha Borough is Republican Craig S. Dunwell, whose term of office ends December 31, 2023. Members of the Alpha Borough Council are Council President Robert J. Melick Jr. (R, 2023), Angela Bickar (I, 2022; elected to serve an unexpired term), Louis J. Cartabona (R, 2023), Todd W. Pantuso (R, 2022), Peter Petinelli (R, 2024) and Jodie Smith (R, 2024). Angela Bickar was elected to fill the seat expiring in December 2022 that had been held by Edward Hanics Jr.

Republican councilmember Jack Preiss and Democrat Kathleen Ronan, both serving terms ending in December 2018, resigned from office in September 2016. Preiss cited time conflicts with his work duties, while Ronan expressed her frustrations with working with the rest of the council. Louis Cartabona was chosen to fill the seat held by Preiss. In October, the council selected Jennifer Gable from a list of three nominees submitted by the Democratic municipal committee to fill Ronan&#x27;s vacant seat. In the 2017 general election, Louis J. Cartabona and Alan Singleton were elected to serve the balance of the two unexpired terms of office.

Harry Zikas became the state&#x27;s youngest mayor ever when he took office in 2000 at the age of 21. Zikas announced his resignation from office in September 2014, citing his acceptance of a job in Northern New Jersey. With Mayor Ed Hanics casting the tiebreaking vote, Tracy Grossman was selected in October 2014 to fill the remainder of Zikas&#x27;s term of office.

In January 2014, the borough council selected Millard Rooks to fill the vacant seat expiring in December 2015 of Michael Savary, who had resigned after pleading guilty to disorderly tampering with public records.

<text>Blairstown is a township in Warren County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 5,704, a decrease of 263 (−4.4%) from the 2010 census count of 5,967, which in turn reflected an increase of 220 (+3.8%) from the 5,747 counted in the 2000 census.

The area had been known as Smith&#x27;s Mill and was later called Butts Bridge (variously spelled as &quot;Butt&#x27;s Bridge&quot; and &quot;Butts&#x27; Bridge&quot;), named for a family that owned the eponymous crossing of the Paulins Kill.

Blairstown was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 14, 1845, from portions of Knowlton Township, based on the results of a referendum held that day. The township was named for John Insley Blair.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 30.78 square miles (79.71 km2), including 29.89 square miles (77.41 km2) of land and 0.89 square miles (2.30 km2) of water (2.88%). The township is located in the Kittatinny Valley which is a section of the Great Appalachian Valley that stretches for from Canada to Alabama.

Blairstown CDP (with a 2010 Census population of 515) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) located within the township.

Other unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Blair Lake, Cedar Lake, Cooks Pond, Jacksonburg, Kalaroma, Lake Susquehanna, Mount Vernon, Paulina, Vail and Walnut Valley.

White Township borders the Warren County municipalities of Frelinghuysen Township, Hardwick Township, Hope Township and Knowlton Township.

==Demographics==

===2010 census===
The 2010 United States census counted 5,967 people, 2,124 households, and 1,703 families in the township. The population density was 193.6 per square mile (74.7/km2).

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.79% (226) of the population.

Of the 2,124 households, 32.8% had children under the age of 18; 66.8% were married couples living together; 9.4% had a female householder with no husband present and 19.8% were non-families. Of all households, 15.8% were made up of individuals and 6.3% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.78 and the average family size was 3.11.

==Transportation==
===Roads and highways===

, the township had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality, by Warren County and by the New Jersey Department of Transportation.

Interstate 80 (the Bergen-Passaic Expressway) passes through the southern part of the township for without any interchanges, and is accessible via Route 94 and CR 521 in neighboring Knowlton and Hope townships, respectively. Route 94 passes for runs east–west through the center of the township while County Route 521 passes through in the eastern section.

===Airport===
Blairstown Airport (1N7) is located southwest of the central business district. The airport serves small planes and gliders.

===Railroads===

The Lackawanna Cut-Off, a high-speed, double-track railway line that stretches for , was constructed by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad between 1908 and 1911, opening for service on December 24, 1911. It ran west from Port Morris, New Jersey to Slateford, Pennsylvania and passed through Blairstown. The DL&amp;W RR merged with the Erie Railroad on October 17, 1960, to form the Erie Lackawanna Railroad. Due to declining revenues, passenger service over the Lackawanna Cut-Off was discontinued on January 6, 1970, and freight service ceased in 1979, just three years after the E-L was absorbed into the Consolidated Railroad Corporation (Conrail). The tracks remained relatively-dormant until 1984, when the property was sold to a developer and the rails were removed.

The right-of-way is now the property of the State of New Jersey, and plans are underway for the restoration of rail service in the future. As part of restoring train service by New Jersey Transit via the Lackawanna Cut-Off, $61 million had been secured to restore railbed and tracks of the former railroad, with passenger service anticipated to be restored in 2026 or 2027. Blairstown&#x27;s poured concrete passenger and freight stations still stand, although privately owned. The restored service plans include a stop at the Blairstown station as part of extension of Amtrak service to the Poconos and Scranton, Pennsylvania.

Blairstown was also served by a second railroad, the Blairstown Railway. The short line, a personal project of the local industrial magnate John Insley Blair, was constructed in 1876 from Blairstown to Delaware Township, where it connected with the Old Main Line of the Lackawanna RR. The Blairstown Railway was absorbed by the New York, Susquehanna &amp; Western Railroad in 1882 as it built west to the coal fields of Pennsylvania. The NYS&amp;W also operated passenger service between Blairstown and New York (via Jersey City, NJ) until 1935. A third railroad, the Lehigh and New England Railroad, operated through Blairstown via trackage rights over the NYS&amp;W between Swartswood Junction and Hainesburg Junction until October 31, 1961, when the L&amp;NE was abandoned. With the loss of L&amp;NE trackage rights revenues and little local business to sustain the line, the NYS&amp;W also abandoned its line through Blairstown shortly thereafter, and the tracks were removed in 1962. The right-of-way today has been preserved by the State of New Jersey as the long Paulinskill Valley Trail.

<text>Hackettstown is a town in Warren County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is perhaps best known as the home to the US headquarters of Mars, Inc.. As of the 2020 United States census, the town&#x27;s population was 10,248, an increase of 524 (+5.4%) from the 2010 census count of 9,724, which in turn reflected a decline of 679 (−6.5%) from the 10,403 counted in the 2000 census.

Hackettstown was incorporated as a town by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 9, 1853, from portions of Independence Township. Portions of territory were exchanged with Mansfield Township in 1857, 1860, 1872 and 1875.

==History==
=== Founding ===
William Johnson (1817–1891) was a prime contributor to the incorporation of the town in 1853. He and his brother George (1815–1889) were successful merchants in the town beginning in 1839 when they began operating the W.L. &amp; G.W Johnson dry good store. The two men were very active in community affairs. George was a member of First Presbyterian Church, a director of the Hackettstown National Bank, and a member of the Hackettstown Water Board. Both men were involved in the establishment of the Union Cemetery.

Hackettstown was named after Samuel Hackett, an early settler and large landowner. Hackett is said to have &quot;contributed liberally to the liquid refreshments on the christening of a new hotel, in order to secure the name which, before this, had been Helms&#x27; Mills or Musconetcong.&quot;

===Tillie Smith murder case===

In 1886, Tillie Smith, a 19-year-old kitchen worker from a poverty-stricken family, was raped, murdered and left lying in an open field near the campus of the Centenary Collegiate Institute, where she worked. James Titus, a janitor at the school, was tried and convicted of the rape and murder, based on circumstantial evidence and public opinion shaped by yellow journalism. Titus was sentenced to hang, but he signed a confession to avoid the death penalty and served 19 years of hard labor. He lived from 1904 to 1952 in Hackettstown among many of the same residents who championed his conviction, the validity of which remains controversial. The killing remains a popular local legend, inspiring several books, Weird NJ magazine articles, theatrical performances and dark tourism ghost tours.

=== 20th century ===
The Hackettstown State Fish Hatchery, a popular tourist destination, was established in 1912.

In 1925, a train wreck just outside of town killed about 50 people and injured about 50 others en route to Hoboken, New Jersey, from Chicago. The derailment involved a Lackawanna Railroad train and occurred at the Hazen Road grade crossing near Rockport Road at approximately 3:30 am, as a result of debris washed downhill by a storm fouling the road crossing. The event made national headlines and stands as the deadliest event in Warren County history.

Fund-raising campaigns for a new hospital started as early as 1945, supported and organized by local civic and business groups including Kiwanis, Unico International, PTA and others, a large donation by the Seventh Day Adventists and a grant from the United States Public Health Service, the 106-bed Hackettstown Community Hospital was established in 1973.

In 1977, a mass shooting occurred in the town when Emil Pierre Benoist, a 20-year-old graduate of Hackettstown High School and former U.S. Marine, took random shots at passing cars over the course of about four hours and shot and killed six people before turning his sniper rifle on himself.

In 1994, a charity BBQ picnic organized by the &quot;Tri-County Motorcycle Club&quot; at the Elk&#x27;s Lodge in Hackettstown was crashed by rival members of the outlaw Pagan&#x27;s Motorcycle Club. &quot;An altercation started that escalated into knives and guns being used&quot;, according to the Warren County Prosecutor. Two Pagans were killed and three other bikers were injured.

=== 21st century ===
Hackettstown was named #72 of the top 100 towns in the United States to Live and Work In by &quot;Money&quot; Magazine in 2005; it has not been included since.

<text>Hardwick Township is a township in Warren County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 1,598, a decrease of 98 (−5.8%) from the 2010 census count of 1,696, which in turn reflected an increase of 232 (+15.8%) from the 1,464 counted in the 2000 census.

==History==
Hardwick Township was created around 1713 through a royal patent. The township was created by Royal charter on January 22, 1750, from Greenwich Township when the area was part of Morris County. It became part of the newly created Sussex County on June 8, 1753. Parts of Hardwick Township were taken on November 11, 1782, to form Independence Township. Hardwick Township was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. On November 20, 1824, most of Hardwick Township was transferred to form part of Warren County, with the remainder staying in Sussex County as parts of Green Township and Stillwater Township, which were both created as of December 27, 1824. Frelinghuysen Township was created March 7, 1848, from portions of the township. The township was named for Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke.

Hardwick Township&#x27;s unusual geographic footprint is due to its absorption of Pahaquarry Township, which was dissolved on July 2, 1997. Pahaquarry Township had been created on March 14, 1825, and received its name from the word &quot;Pahaquarra&quot;, which was a derivation of the Native American word &quot;Pahaqualong&quot; used by the Lenape meaning &quot;termination of two mountains&quot; (describing the mountain or mountainous area that was the area&#x27;s southern border) or &quot;the place between the mountains beside the waters&quot;.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 38.94 square miles (100.85 km2), including 37.53 square miles (97.19 km2) of land and 1.42 square miles (3.66 km2) of water (3.63%). The part of the township east of the Kittatinny Ridge (the part excluding the now defunct Pahaquarry Township) is located in the Kittatinny Valley which is a section of the Great Appalachian Valley that stretches for from Canada to Alabama. The defunct Pahaquarry section of the Township which borders the Delaware River is located in the Minisink Valley that extends from the Delaware Water Gap north to Port Jervis, New York.

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Bass Lake, Franklin Grove, Hardwick, Hardwick Center, Millbrook, Newbakers Corner, Sand Pond, Squares Corner and White Pond.

Sunfish Pond is a glacial lake surrounded by a hardwood forest located on the Kittatinny Ridge within Worthington State Forest, adjacent to the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area. The Appalachian Trail runs alongside the western and northern edges of the lake, which was created by the Wisconsin Glacier during the last ice age. The lake was declared a National Natural Landmark in January 1970.

Camp Ralph S. Mason is a YMCA, established in 1900, that covers adjacent to the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area that serves approximately 800 campers in its summer camp programs and 7,000 participants at its outdoor center.

The Pahaquarry Copper Mine is an abandoned copper mine. Active mining was attempted for brief periods during the mid-eighteenth, mid-nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries but was never successful. The site is administered by the National Park Service.

Hardwick Township borders the municipalities of Blairstown, Frelinghuysen Township, and Knowlton Township in Warren County; and Stillwater Township and Walpack Township in Sussex County.
