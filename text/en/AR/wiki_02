<text>Hyden is a home rule-class city in and the county seat of Leslie County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 365 at the 2010 census. It is located at the junction of U.S. Route 421 and Kentucky Route 80, along the Middle Fork of the Kentucky River.

==History==
The area was first settled around 1800 by the Sizemores, a mixed-blood (Anglo and Native-American) family migrating from North Carolina, with a brief stay in Hawkins County, Tennessee, before making it to Kentucky. John &quot;Rock House&quot; Sizemore and his wife, Nancy (Bowling) Sizemore, lived in a rock house about a hundred yards up from the mouth of the creek which would later bear his name (Rockhouse Creek). John Rock House later sold the land to a Lewis man who then donated the land to the government, which became the town of Hyden. The town was established in 1878 and incorporated in 1882, and was named after John Hyden, a state senator of the time who helped form Leslie County. The mountainous terrain made the region difficult to access except by river, which was no longer the dominant form of transportation by the late 19th century, hindering growth.

Frontier Nursing University opened in Hyden in 1939.

Hyden briefly came to national attention when the Hurricane Creek mine disaster occurred in late 1970, southeast of the city.

In July 1978, Richard Nixon came to Hyden to make his first public speech since resigning from the presidency during the Watergate crisis. Hyden was picked because Judge-Executive C. Allen Muncy wrote a letter inviting him to attend the dedication of a recreation facility and Nixon wanted a town that had heavily supported his presidential runs. Leslie County Judge-Executive C. Allen Muncy claimed the Nixon invitation prompted the U.S. Department of Justice to obtain indictments of him and his associates on vote-fraud charges; while on appeal for his conviction, he won renomination in the Republican primary but lost the 1981 general election to independent Kermit Keen.

<text>Blackey is an unincorporated community in Letcher County, Kentucky, in the United States. As of the 2010 census, the population was 120. It is located near the early settlement of Indian Bottom. Blackey is thought to have been named after Blackey Brown, one of its citizens.

==History==
The history of Blackey began in 1908, after local resident Jim Brown was given permission to establish a post office on Elk Creek. He decided to name the post office &quot;Blackey&quot;, after his brother Joseph &quot;Blackey&quot; Brown. Due to the area&#x27;s massive coal deposits, the Lexington and Eastern Railroad ran a line through Blackey in November 1912. Over the next fifteen years, Blackey was transformed from a sleepy mountain town to a bustling modern city. It was chartered in November 1912 and incorporated on January 27, 1915. In 1913, the community became the home of the Stuart Robinson School, a Presbyterian settlement school that was to operate there until 1957. In 1917, the Blackey Coal Company was established as the first coal company in the community. The company constructed thirty houses and employed eighty miners.

In May 1927, a flash flood devastated the city. In one hour, the North Fork of the Kentucky River rose , killing 26 people in Letcher County alone. Later in December a fire broke out, destroying most of the city&#x27;s business district. Then in February 1928, another fire broke out and destroyed the rest of the town. Shortly afterwards, Blackey State Bank failed and the Great Depression ended the prosperity of the boom town.

Today, Blackey is home to just over 150 people, with only a few abandoned buildings and a few occupied homes on Main Street. Within the last few years, the city has seen some revitalization consisting of a Head Start, a new city water system, and a public library.

==Geography==

The city was established by the Elkhorn Coal Corporation which moved into the area in 1913. Fleming was the location of the mine and was named for its first president, George W. Fleming. A city named &quot;Chip&quot; existed near the community that became Fleming; it was quickly built up and served as a trading center for the nearby coal towns. The train that hauled the coal out of Fleming would make stops in Neon. Local tradition holds that the conductor would holler instructions to people climbing aboard the train to &quot;Knee On&quot; and this was corrupted into the present name, replacing Chip. In 1977, the two towns were merged into Fleming-Neon during their municipal incorporation by the General Assembly.

<text>Jenkins is a home rule-class city in Letcher County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 2,203 as of the 2010 census.

==History==

In autumn of 1911, the Consolidation Coal Company purchased the current location of Jenkins as part of a tract of land in Pike, Letcher, and Floyd counties from the Northern Coal and Coke Company. After the acquisition was finalized, plans were made to extend the Lexington and Eastern Railroad from Jackson to a town named McRoberts. The plans also included the establishment of the town of Jenkins for George C. Jenkins, one of the Consolidation Coal Company&#x27;s directors.

Because of the need of hundreds of homes and other structures, nine sawmills and two brickyards were erected. A dynamo was built to temporarily generate power for the houses. Next, a temporary narrow-gauge railroad was built over Pine Mountain from Glamorgan, Virginia, in order to carry supplies to further the development of the town. Jenkins&#x27;s city government was established as soon as the businesses and land were put up for sale. The company even went as far to supply the town with its own marshals to enforce the law. Jenkins was finally incorporated as a sixth-class city on January 9, 1912.

Jenkins was home to minor league baseball from 1948 to 1951. The Jenkins Cavaliers played as members of the Class D level Mountain States League. Jenkins played home games at the Jenkins Athletic Field.

In 1956, Consolidation Coal sold Jenkins to Bethlehem Steel. Bethlehem Steel closed the mine in 1988.

Diana Baldwin and Anita Cherry, hired as miners in 1973, are believed to have been the first women to work in an underground coal mine in the United States. They were the first female members of United Mine Workers of America to work inside a mine. Cherry and Baldwin were hired by the Beth-Elkhorn Coal Company in Jenkins. 

During the Southeast Kentucky floods of 2020, water spilled over the top of the Elkhorn Lake dam above Jenkins, which is considered one of Kentucky&#x27;s most dangerous. About 30 percent of Jenkins is vulnerable to flooding in the event of a dam break, and the town lacks a comprehensive emergency plan.

==History==
Founded in 1797, Vanceburg is named for a cofounder of the city, William Vance. Joseph Baird and William Vance received land rights and divided the area into parcels for sale. While Baird was the header of the project, the two agreed that a coin toss would settle who the town would be named after. Baird won the toss and the name “Bairdstown” was decided upon. However, the two soon decided that “Bairdstown” too closely resembled the already established city of Bardstown, Kentucky. After reaching this conclusion the pair settled on the name &quot;Vanceburg&quot;. The city and surrounding area originally thrived on salt productions and mines located along and in Salt Lick Creek, which flows through the city and inland through much of the heart of the county.
Vanceburg was once a thriving production city, with a small train station and a bustling downtown area. In 1937 the city was flooded, as were many cities along the river, which crested at . A crest mark could once be found marked on the old Lock and Dam building west of Vanceburg on KY 8 but is no longer visible. During the flood all of downtown Vanceburg was under water. As a result, 1st Street of Vanceburg was washed into the river. The section of bank on which the homes and businesses once sat slid into the raging stream. Now, one will notice that there is no &quot;1st Street&quot; in the city, only &quot;Front Street&quot;. The city streets were renamed according to their order back from Front Street. Front Street now is the nearest street to the river and sits nearly directly on the river bank.

<text>Hustonville is a home rule-class city in Lincoln County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 405 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Danville Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The community was originally known as The Crossroads from its location on trails connecting the Kentucky and Green rivers and the Falls of the Ohio with Logan&#x27;s Fort (present-day Stanford). It was then known as Farmington and, after the 1818 erection of a post office, Hanging Fork after a local stream named for two bandits who were hanged by Virginia officers rather than escorted back for trial. For three months in 1826, it was known as New Store, but the name then returned to Hanging Fork. When the town was established on February 29, 1836, it was renamed Hustonville after two local landowners; the post office adopted the name the next year. The city was formally incorporated by the state assembly in 1850.

During the mid 19th and early 20th centuries, Hustonville was home to Christian College. The school was established following a fundraising campaign by William Logan Williams, who had been instrumental in securing money for church construction in the city. Future U.S. senator and Governor of Kentucky, Augustus O. Stanley, served as chair of &quot;belles-lettres&quot; at the school in 1890.

<text>Stanford is a home rule-class city in Lincoln County, Kentucky, United States. It is one of the oldest settlements in Kentucky, having been founded in 1775. Its population was 3,487 at the 2010 census and an estimated 3,686 in 2018. It is the county seat of Lincoln County. Stanford is part of the Danville Micropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==

Stanford was founded in 1775 by Benjamin Logan as &quot;St. Asaph&quot;; the early settlement was also known simply as &quot;Logan&#x27;s Fort&quot;. The site of the fort is about one mile west of the courthouse at the center of town. The name &quot;Fort Logan&quot; is still used to this day by local businesses, including the Fort Logan Hospital and Standing Fort Collectibles. The main street was built on what was originally a buffalo trail.

The name &quot;Stanford&quot; may have come from &quot;Standing Fort&quot;, a name given to Fort Logan because it survived multiple attacks by British-led Native Americans during the American Revolution. Alternately, it may have been named for Stamford, England. Although it was one of the smaller pioneer forts, it never fell to an attack.

In 1781, the original settlement expanded when Benjamin Logan donated part of his own land as the site for a courthouse. The county court continued to meet at Fort Harrod (now Harrodsburg) until 1785, when Mercer County was established. By 1786 Stanford had received its charter, making it one of the first towns in the former (1776–1780) Kentucky County, Virginia, with a formal charter. In 1787 the courthouse opened in a building made of logs. It has been expanded and upgraded over time, but the courthouse remains on the same site. Unlike most courthouses in Kentucky, it has never suffered from a fire or other major loss of records. Lincoln County has all its original records and archives dating from November 1789, making it one of the more complete archives in Kentucky. Among its original land deeds kept on vellum are deeds granting land to both Daniel Boone and Simon Kenton.

The first recorded church in Stanford was a Presbyterian church built in 1790, reflecting the staunch Presbyterian beliefs of the Logan family. The building still stands and is now part of the Harvey Helm Memorial Historic Library and Museum on Main Street. Other denominations, including Baptist and Methodist, were not established in the area until the 1830s. The current Presbyterian Church in Stanford has stood on the same site since around 1850.

A small local library was first established in the 1830s. The library was renamed in 1970 in honor of Harvey Helm, a native son who became a Kentucky statesman and member of the United States House of Representatives between 1909 and 1917.

The first school was built sometime in the 1850s, as the Male Academy. It was established in a building that is now the Fox Funeral Home on West Main Street. The corresponding Female Academy was built in the 1870s. The Stanford School was founded in 1900, and after much expansion, still serves, now as the Lincoln County Student Support Center.

Largely untouched by the American Civil War (the nearest conflict was the Battle of Perryville, away), Stanford grew significantly in the post-war period. In the late 1860s, the town gained its own newspaper, the &quot;Stanford Banner&quot;, which is still publishing as the &quot;Interior Journal&quot;. The city continued to grow, especially after the Louisville and Nashville Railroad built a station and line into the town in late 1865. Now the railroad line has closed, and the tracks were removed in 1988, leaving only a small spur line that connects to Mount Vernon, to the southeast. However, the railway depot has been restored, and Stanford is notable as the location of the first automobile garage in Kentucky, which opened in 1905.

==Geography==
Stanford is located in south-central Kentucky in the southernmost extent of the Bluegrass region along the Southern Knobs in northern Lincoln County. U.S. Route 27 passes through the east side of the city, leading northeast to Lancaster and to Lexington, and south to Somerset.

The settlement was formally incorporated by the state assembly in 1890 as Grand Rivers. This newly expanded community was part of local businessman Thomas W. Lawson&#x27;s attempt to develop local iron deposits into a major steel industry. (The enterprise failed within a few years.)

<text>Russellville is a home rule-class city in Logan County, Kentucky, in the United States. It is the seat of its county. The population was 6,960 at the time of the 2010 census.

==History==

Local historian Alex C. Finley has claimed the area was first settled by Gasper Butcher, as a frontier settlement of the Transylvania Colony of Virginia, around 1780, but others have questioned this claim. Although the area is known to have been called &quot;Big  Boiling Spring&quot;, &quot;Gasper Butcher&#x27;s Spring&quot;, and &quot;Butcher&#x27;s Station&quot;, W.R. Jillson was unable to find written records of any habitation before 1790. That year William Cook and his wife erected Cook&#x27;s Cabin, accompanied by eighteen-year-old William Stewart. Also known as &quot;Cook&#x27;s Station&quot;, the community was located about east of the present city. It was renamed &quot;Logan Court House&quot; when it was chosen as the seat of newly formed Logan County in 1792.

General William Russell was given a grant here for his military service during the American Revolution. He donated part of this property, in 1795, as a platted section for the county seat, known as Logan Court House. The town was renamed in Russell&#x27;s honor in 1798. It was formally established by the state legislature on January 15, 1810. It was incorporated as a city on February 19, 1840.

In the early 19th century, the community had leaders who were politically prominent in the state. Four homes in the city still stand that were residences of future governors of Kentucky: John Breathitt, James Morehead, John J. Crittenden, and Charles S. Morehead.

During the Civil War, the Kentucky General Assembly declared its neutrality and declined to secede with the rest of the South. Kentucky was a slave state and Confederate sentiment was strong in the Bluegrass region and the west, but the residents of the mountainous eastern section were mainly small farmers and pro-Union. In the summer of 1861, when Confederate troops had occupied the area, 116 prominent pro-Confederate delegates from 68 counties met as the Russellville Convention and created a rival Confederate government for Kentucky. George W. Johnson was elected as the state&#x27;s Confederate governor and the Confederacy controlled more than half the state early in the war. Despite &quot;de facto&quot; Union control over the rest of Kentucky after 1862, the government was recognized and Kentucky admitted to the Confederacy. Kentucky was represented by the thirteenth star on the Confederate flag. During the war, there were several minor skirmishes in and around Russellville.

After the war, Kentucky struggled for some years with insurgent unrest. A gang made up of the former Confederate guerrillas Cole Younger, George Shepard, and Oliver Shepard, along with Confederate veterans John Jarrett and Arthur McCoy, robbed the Nimrod Long Bank or the Southern Deposit Bank in Russellville on March 20, 1868. Brothers Frank and Jesse James, who later had their own outlaw gang based in western Missouri, may have taken part. A Russellville bank on the city square displays a large mural painted depicting the robbery. A reenactment (called a &quot;play on horseback&quot;) is performed annually during the city&#x27;s Tobacco and Heritage Festival.

Several downtown homes have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places including the Victorian Mansion at 224 Cornelius Avenue, a house that boasted the state&#x27;s first indoor bathroom.

The Kentucky State Penitentiary is located at Eddyville. The town is considered a tourist attraction because of its access to nearby Lake Barkley.

==History==
Eddyville, the seat of Lyon County, was settled around 1798 and named for the eddies in the nearby Cumberland River. It became the seat of Livingston County when the county was formed in 1799; then the seat of Caldwell County upon its formation in 1809; and finally the seat of Lyon County upon its establishment in 1854. Thus, it holds the distinction of being the only city in Kentucky to have served as the county seat of three separate counties. The Eddyville post office opened in 1801.

Throughout Kentucky, Eddyville is best known as a metonym for the Kentucky State Penitentiary, although the prison itself is actually south of the present town on the shore of Lake Barkley in &quot;Old Eddyville&quot; on KY 730. Taking six years to build (1884–1890), the massive stone prison structure towers over Lake Barkley and is sometimes called &quot;The Castle on the Cumberland.&quot; Its electric chair has had a long history of use, dating to the period before 1936 when executions were still publicly conducted in Kentucky for some crimes (e.g. rape as in the case of Rainey Bethea) while electrocutions at Eddyville were strictly reserved for others (e.g., murder). Executions are still held at the prison, although there have only been three since 1976 and only one since 1999. The primary method has been changed to lethal injection.

Following the completion of Kentucky Dam in the 1940s, rumours began that a dam would be built on the lower Cumberland. This meant relocating Eddyville and Kuttawa. By the mid-1950s, the construction plans were confirmed. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began surveying for the construction of Barkley Dam. This was met with anger from the local population.

The situation was resolved by Lee S. Jones, a native of Lyon County who had attended law school and settled in Louisville, where he had gained a reputation as one of the best &quot;tax lawyers&quot; and made his wealth. Jones had purchased farms in the Fairview community (which is now the site of Eddyville). He came to the Eddyville City Council and presented his plan: each person owning land in the towns (Eddyville and Kuttawa) to be flooded would receive a free lot in the new Eddyville site. This also applied to businesses.

Eddyville residents accepted his offer and on August 13, 1959, the official plat for the new town was filed with the county court clerk. The plat included 254 residential lots, 46 business lots, for construction of a school and campus, city park, courthouse, health office, water works, and location of streets.

August 28, 1959, was designated as &quot;Dedication and Free Deed Day&quot; at the new site. A large group of people gathered for the event, which was held in a field, close to the site of the current post office. Mr. Jones handed the first deed to Boyce and Lillian Yates, then presented approximately 60 more residential lots. The first house to be built in the new town was the home of Mr. and Mrs. J. I. Moore. The first business to be built was the Kentucky Utilities office. During the time of building, Eddyville was &quot;booming&quot; and, with the impoundment of Lake Barkley in the 1960s, tourists began making their way into the area for the abundance of fish and boating. However, the tourist influx wasn&#x27;t sufficient to create a steady economic growth. Although campgrounds and marinas were springing up around the lake, the city was struggling.

Construction of the West Kentucky Outlet Mall was launched in December 1988. Three brothers, Bob, Darrell and Ben Jent, purchased a tract of land in the city limits of Eddyville and started construction of a mall, which opened the following fall with ten stores. Within a short time the mall would boast a total of nearly 50 stores. The opening of the mall brought a surge of progress to Eddyville, as a variety of businesses began to move into the city. For the first time in the town&#x27;s history, people could choose their favorite restaurant, motel, clothing store or other places to shop—all without leaving town. It has been said the mall did more for the progress of Eddyville than any other endeavor since the establishment of the town in 1799, with the possible exception of the building of the Kentucky State Penitentiary. The town was listed as the second fastest growing area in Kentucky in 1997 based on tourism.

The mall has since suffered severe economic troubles, and few stores are currently left.

A regional water park, Venture River, operates seasonally in Eddyville.

Hundreds of homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in Eddyville and Lyon County from an EF4 tornado that ripped through western Kentucky on December 10–11, 2021. Later, an EF3 tornado would touchdown near Eddyville on May 26th, 2024, and cause damage in areas previously affected by the western Kentucky tornado outbreak on December 10–11th.

<text>Kuttawa is a home rule-class city in Lyon County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 649 as of the 2010 census, up from 596 in 2000.

==History==

Former Ohio governor Charles Anderson founded the town on land he purchased in 1866. Originally spelled &quot;Cuttawa&quot; and &quot;Kittawa&quot;, Kuttawa seems to have been the name of a Cherokee village near the site, whose meaning is a matter of dispute: it has been variously translated as &quot;beautiful&quot;, &quot;city in the woods&quot;, and &quot;great wilderness&quot;. The city was formally incorporated by the state assembly in 1872, the same year it received its post office.

In the early 1960s, the Tennessee Valley Authority constructed a dam across the Cumberland River at Grand Rivers, forming Lake Barkley. Eddyville and Kuttawa were both moved from their original locations owing to the impounded lake.

==Geography==
Kuttawa is located in north-central Lyon County and is bordered to the east by Eddyville and to the south by Lake Barkley, an impoundment of the Cumberland River, just upstream from Barkley Dam. The city is concentrated primarily in an area adjacent to the western intersection of U.S. Route 62 and Kentucky Route 295, though its municipal boundaries extend southwestward along US 62 and Kentucky Route 810, northeastward to the intersection of US 62 and the merged Interstate 24/Interstate 69, and along KY 295 as it follows the lakeshore to its eastern intersection with US 62.

The Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area lies along the lakeshore opposite Kuttawa. Mineral Mound State Park borders the city to the east. Both Barkley Dam and Kentucky Dam (the latter of which impounds the Tennessee River) are located southwest of Kuttawa. By highway, Kuttawa is east of Paducah, northwest of Hopkinsville, and southwest of Madisonville.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city of Kuttawa has a total area of , of which are land and , or 27.40%, are water.

The median age was 55 years. For every 100 females, there were 70.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 68.4 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $45,357, and the median income for a family was $55,208. Males had a median income of $48,571 versus $31,375 for females. The per capita income for the city was $21,355. About 5.6% of families and 7.7% of the population were below the poverty line, including 11.9% of those under age 18 and 7.0% of those age 65 or over.

<text>Richmond is a home rule-class city in Madison County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 34,585 as of the 2020 census, making it the state&#x27;s seventh-largest city. It is the principal city of the Richmond–Berea micropolitan area, which includes all of Madison and Rockcastle counties and had 123,000 residents in 2020.

The city is named after Richmond, Virginia, and is home to Eastern Kentucky University. Richmond is the seat of Madison County and serves as the center for work and shopping in south-central Kentucky. Richmond is home to numerous festivals, notably the Millstone Festival.

==History==
Richmond was founded in 1798 by Colonel John Miller from Richmond, Virginia. A British American, Miller served with the rebels in the Revolutionary War. According to lore, he was attracted to the area by its good spring water and friendly Native Americans.

With the original county seat of Madison County being Milford, Kentucky, Miller successfully lobbied the Kentucky legislature to move it from Milford to present-day Richmond. Although the residents of Milford strongly opposed the move, the county approved the transfer in March 1798. On July 4, 1798, the new town was named Richmond in honor of Miller&#x27;s Virginia birthplace. Richmond was incorporated in 1809.

Kentucky was a southern border state during the Civil War and remained mostly in the Union, even though early in the war, 68 of 110 Kentucky counties seceded to join the Confederacy; however, the state largely came back under U.S. control after early 1862. On August 30, 1862, the Battle of Richmond took place. Confederate General Edmund Kirby Smith routed the Union General William Nelson, capturing or killing 5,300 of his 6,500 men. One historian called this battle &quot;the nearest thing to a Cannae ever scored by any general, North or South, in the course of the whole war.&quot;

In 1906, Eastern Kentucky State Normal School was founded in Richmond to train teachers. The school graduated its first class of 11 teachers in 1909. In 1922, it was established as a four-year college and in 1935 added a graduate degree program. In 1965, the institution was renamed Eastern Kentucky University.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Richmond saw significant growth, becoming the state&#x27;s seventh-largest city in 2009.

<text>Salyersville () is a home rule-class city on the Licking River in Magoffin County, Kentucky, in the United States. It is the seat of its county. As of the 2020 census, the population was 1,591, down from 1,883 in 2010.

==History==

===Early history===
The hill overlooking the bend of the Licking River just downriver from the present town was fortified and settled by Archibald Prater, Ebenezer Hanna, and others. Originally known as &quot;Prater&#x27;s Fort&quot;, the community had become &quot;Licking Station&quot; by the time of its first post office in 1839.

In 1849, the post office was moved to the community at site of the present city and renamed &quot;Adamsville&quot; after local landowner Uncle William Adams. In addition to his farmland, Adams operated a hotel, a gristmill, a tannery and a blacksmith at the new location.

In 1860, Magoffin County was formed from parts of the surrounding Floyd, Johnson, and Morgan counties. Billy Adams donated land for the platting and establishment of a new county seat, and the community was renamed &quot;Salyersville&quot; in gratitude to State Rep. Samuel Salyer, who sponsored the bill creating the new county. The post office changed the following year.

During the Civil War, Salyersville fell on hard times. Because of its location in the Upper South and its history of settlement by migrants and farmers from Virginia, some residents sided with the Confederacy, despite the general lack of slaves in the area. In 1864, Union forces defeated a Confederate raiding force in the Battle of Salyersville.

Adams gave more land to the city in 1871 for the construction of a proper courthouse. It was completed in 1890 and stood for 67 years before burning to the ground in 1957.

===20th century===
Salyersville&#x27;s first high school, the Magoffin County Institute, was founded in 1908 by A.C. Harlowe.

The Great Depression hit Salyersville hard, since such a high percentage of Salyersville&#x27;s citizens were laborers or farmers, who saw prices for crops fall from 40 to 60%. Nearby mining and logging operations also closed or limited production when demand for their products fell sharply. In 1939, floods in February and July caused extensive property damage. During the July event, the Licking River crested over .
The Mountain Parkway opened in 1963, stretching west from Salyersville to intersect with Interstate 64 at a point just east of Winchester. It enabled more tourists to visit the area, and heritage tourism began to help Salyersville develop a changed economy. 

The first Magoffin County Founder&#x27;s Day Festival was held in 1979; the annual event continued until 2015.

In the winter of 1997, as part of Kentucky&#x27;s elk restoration project, Salyersville became one of the locations selected for the release of elk into the wilderness area of its mountains.

===21st century===

Between 2002 and 2006, the third Magoffin County courthouse (erected in 1959 ) was demolished and replaced with a new Magoffin County Justice Center.

On March 2, 2012, Salyersville was hit by a tornado which caused extensive damage to many businesses and homes. There were no deaths reported in Salyersville. The tornado was reported an EF3. Kentucky governor Steve Beshear visited Salyersville and toured the eastern part of the state after the tornado outbreak.

<text>Bradfordsville is a home rule-class city in Marion County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 270 at the time of the 2020 census.

The community at the site was first known as Centerville from its supposed location at the center of the state. (Having since gained the Jackson Purchase, the present geographic center of the state remains nearby at Cowherd Road and McCarty Lane on Ky. 429 northwest of Lebanon.) The settlement was renamed Bradford&#x27;s Mill after Peter Bradford&#x27;s combined saw- and gristmill at the site; this became &quot;Bradfordsville&quot; after the establishment of a post office in 1834.

The Rolling Fork is a northwest-flowing tributary of the Salt River, which joins the Ohio River a few miles downstream. Bradfordsville is mostly surrounded by rugged hills, with the Muldraugh Hill escarpment rising to the south.

Bradfordsville is concentrated around the intersection of Kentucky Route 337 (Main Street) and Kentucky Route 49 (Liberty Road). The former leads northeast to Gravel Switch and the Perryville area and southwest to Mannsville, while the latter leads southeast to Liberty and northwest to Lebanon, the Marion county seat.

<text>Lebanon is a home rule-class city and the county seat of Marion County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 6,274 at the 2020 census, up from 5,539 in 2010. Lebanon is located in central Kentucky, southeast of Louisville. A national cemetery is nearby.

==History==
Prior to the establishment of the city now known as Lebanon, the town of Georgetown, north of Lexington, was also named &quot;Lebanon&quot; during its first few years of establishment. It was renamed in 1790 in honor of President George Washington.

Present-day Lebanon was established in 1814 and named for the Biblical Lebanon because of its abundant cedar trees. The founding community traces back to the Hardin&#x27;s Creek Meeting House, built by Presbyterians from Virginia. It was incorporated as a city on January 28, 1815, and became the county seat of Marion County in 1835. Because of its style, architecture, and businesses, Lebanon had the reputation of being Kentucky&#x27;s Philadelphia and was considered for the site of the state capitol.

In the 19th century, Lebanon was one of the stops along the National Turnpike from Maysville to Nashville. In 1819, Henry Clay and Andrew Jackson met here after having crossed paths on their journeys. Many of its brick homes date from the antebellum period, including Hollyhill and Myrtledene (now a bed and breakfast). Much of Lebanon&#x27;s downtown business district was recently placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

A branch of the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad was built to Lebanon in 1857, but growth of the town was halted by the Civil War. Three battles were fought nearby, and control over the railroad branch passed between Union and Confederate hands several times. After the death of his brother Tom during a local battle, Confederate John Hunt Morgan&#x27;s cavalry burned the railroad depot, a hotel, and several residences on July 5, 1863, during the Battle of Lebanon.

Lebanon&#x27;s Historic Homes and Landmarks Tour is also part of the Kentucky Civil War Heritage Trail and includes 24 listings. On the Civil War Discovery Trail, three landmarks stand out. The Commissary Building, which is the old Sunnyside Dispensary Building, was in place during the Civil War and supplied dry goods and food stuffs to the Union garrison in the town. The Shuck building, which is now Henning&#x27;s Restaurant, was the office of General George H. Thomas, when he gathered an army of several thousand to go to Mill Springs to defend the Cumberland Valley. Myrtledene was where General John Hunt Morgan rode his horse in the house and started up the stairs. General Morgan used the property as his headquarters while he was in Lebanon. On the southern limits of Lebanon is the National Cemetery, where many of the Union soldiers who fell in the 1862 Battle of Perryville were laid to rest. The cemetery is the site of many military funerals and hosts annual Memorial Day celebrations.

The town rebounded after the war and became a trade center, but declined as railroads became less important to commerce in the 1900s. The tracks were abandoned, then eventually removed by CSX Transportation in the mid-1980s.

In the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s, Lebanon was known as an entertainment hotspot, as nationally known acts appeared at The Plantation, Club Cherry, Club 68, and the Golden Horseshoe nightclubs. The clubs hosted famous acts such as Ike and Tina Turner, Nat King Cole, Jerry Lee Lewis, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Steppenwolf, The Platters, the Amazing Rhythm Aces, Otis Redding, Jimi Hendrix, Little Richard, Bo Diddley, Jackie Wilson, The Supremes, Ray Charles, James Brown, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Sam and Dave, Wilson Pickett, B.B. King, Percy Sledge, Bobby Blue Bland and Count Basie.

<doc id="115341" wikidata="Q478393" url="?curid=115341" title="Maysville, Kentucky">
<text>Maysville is a home rule-class city in Mason County, Kentucky, United States, and is the county seat of Mason County. The population was 8,873 as of the 2020 census. Maysville is on the Ohio River, northeast of Lexington. It is the principal city of the Maysville Micropolitan Statistical Area, which comprises Mason County. Two bridges cross the Ohio from Maysville to Aberdeen, Ohio: the Simon Kenton Memorial Bridge built in 1931 and the William H. Harsha Bridge built in 2001.

On the edge of the outer Bluegrass Region, Maysville is historically important in Kentucky&#x27;s settlement. Frontiersmen Simon Kenton and Daniel Boone are among the city&#x27;s founders. Later, Maysville became an important port on the Ohio River for the northeastern part of the state. It exported bourbon whiskey, hemp and tobacco, the latter two produced mainly by African American slaves before the Civil War. It was once a center of wrought iron manufacture, sending ironwork downriver to decorate the buildings of Cincinnati, Ohio, and New Orleans, Louisiana. Other small manufacturers also located early in Maysville, and manufacturing remains an important part of the modern economy. Under the leadership of Henry Means Walker, Maysville was home to one of the largest tobacco auction warehouses in the world for most of the 20th century.

Maysville was an important stop on the Underground Railroad, as the free state of Ohio was just across the river. Abolitionist author Harriet Beecher Stowe visited the area in 1833 and watched a slave auction in front of the court house in Washington, the original seat of the county and now a historic district of Maysville. She included the scene in her influential novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, published in 1852.

==History==
===Early settlement===
Buffalo once forded the Ohio here, beating a broad path into the interior of Kentucky in search of salt licks. For thousands of years, various cultures of indigenous peoples inhabited the area, hunting the buffalo and other game. In the 17th century, the powerful Iroquois Confederacy, based in present-day New York state, drove out other tribes to hold the Ohio Valley as a hunting ground.

European-American settlers traveling down the Ohio in the 18th century and early 19th century found a natural harbor at Limestone Creek. The buffalo trace, also a well-used trail traveled for centuries by Native Americans, was a natural path into the bluegrass region, extending all the way to Lexington, Kentucky. Frontiersman Simon Kenton made the first settlement in the area in 1775, but temporarily abandoned that to fight in the western battles of the American Revolution. Returning in 1784, Kenton built a blockhouse at the site of Maysville and founded Kenton&#x27;s Station (frontier fort) at a site inland. Kenton met new settlers at Limestone, as the landing place was called, and escorted them inland to his station. In 1786 the village which grew up near Kenton&#x27;s Station was established by act of the Virginia General Assembly as the town of Washington. By this time, John May had acquired the land at Limestone and Daniel Boone established a trading post and tavern there. In 1787 the little settlement was incorporated as Maysville, though the name &quot;Limestone&quot; persisted well into the 19th century.

===Growth===

In 1788, when Mason County was organized and Washington was named its county seat, Maysville was still a primitive site of warehouses and wharves, with few dwellings. In 1795, the conclusion of the Northwest Indian War reduced the likelihood of Indian attacks from across the Ohio. Maysville began to flourish. Zane&#x27;s Trace, a road from Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia), to the bank of the Ohio River opposite Maysville, was completed in 1797 and stimulated ferry traffic across the river. By 1807, Maysville was one of two principal ports in Kentucky; it was still mostly a place through which goods and people passed, having only about sixty dwellings. In 1811, the first steamboat came down the Ohio from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, passing Maysville on its way to New Orleans. With the coming of the steamboat, Maysville&#x27;s population and area expanded rapidly.

===Maysville Road===

Southwest from Maysville, the road followed the former buffalo trace and Native American trail to Lexington. It was called both the Maysville Road and the Limestone Road. It was maintained by the various counties through which it passed with local labor from the county levies. The road was rough and during certain seasons practically impassable.

In 1829, the Kentucky legislature authorized the Maysville, Washington, Paris, and Lexington Turnpike Road Company to construct a modern roadway along the route of the old Limestone Road. Users would be charged fees for maintenance and paying off the debt to shareholders. The act set aside blocks of shares for purchase by the federal government. Henry Clay, an influential Kentucky politician and proponent of the American System, argued for the Maysville Road and other infrastructure, noting it would be part of a longer road terminating in New Orleans, Louisiana, and proper for federal funding.

In 1830, Congress passed a bill authorizing the federal government to purchase shares in the turnpike company. President Andrew Jackson, a bitter rival of Clay, vetoed the bill, arguing that the project was of purely local benefit. The Maysville Road veto was one of Jackson&#x27;s first acts in aligning the federal government with his principles of Jacksonian democracy.

An attempt to override Jackson&#x27;s veto failed, but the controversy over the Maysville Road veto continued for some time. The turnpike was completed in 1835 with funding from local entities and private investment. It was the first macadamized road in the state. Today it is U.S. Route 68.

===County seat===
By the 1830s, Maysville had a population of 3,000 and was the second-most important commercial city in Kentucky after Louisville. Washington, the county seat, had dwindled in importance after a fire in 1825 and a series of deadly cholera epidemics. A proposal to move the county government from Washington to Maysville was bitterly fought but passed by a slender margin in 1848. Maysville donated its city hall, completed in 1846, to the county for a court house. Today, much of Washington is designated as a historic district, the Washington Historic District; it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In 1850, the Maysville &amp; Lexington Railroad began operation, but it failed within the decade. Successor companies maintained the connection until 1921 when they were bought out by the L&amp;N. Today, the Maysville &amp; Lexington&#x27;s former routes and rights-of-way are owned by CSX Transportation.

==Landmarks==

===Simon Kenton Memorial Bridge===

The Simon Kenton Memorial Bridge is a suspension bridge built in 1931 crossing the Ohio River and originally opened with a toll. Those tolls were removed in 1945 to much fanfare - including celebrations from the local Rotary and Lions club, and a parade in downtown Maysville. Its main span is long, and the total length of the bridge is . It connects Maysville with Aberdeen, Ohio. It is currently in use and is not slated for demolition, as the bridge was closed for refurbishment in 2001 after the William H. Harsha Bridge was completed.

The Simon Kenton Suspension Bridge opened to traffic at 10:30 AM on November 25, 1931, at a cost of $1.6 million (~$ in ). In 2002, a $5.8 million renovation job replaced the deck of the Ohio River crossing. A fresh coat of battleship gray paint was also applied.

===Russell Theatre===

The Russell Theatre, located on Third Street in Maysville, was the site of the world premiere of Rosemary Clooney&#x27;s first film, &quot;The Stars Are Singing&quot;, in 1953. The Russell Theatre is an atmospheric theatre, and featured a large rainbow that would light up before and after the showing of each movie. The theatre is now undergoing the second phase of a restoration project that began in 2008. Organizers plan to revive the Russell as a movie and film venue, with emphasis on themed movie marathons, classics, documentaries, art films and other movies not available at mainstream cinemas.

===Maysville Murals===

In the summer of 1998, a series of historical murals was begun on the downtown floodwall. Over the next ten years, Robert Dafford and his team painted ten murals exploring the history of Maysville on various sections of the floodwall.
* 17th century River Valley Hunting Grounds – A Native American bison hunt on the buffalo trace.
* 18th century Limestone Landing – The initial settlement of European-Americans on the future site of Maysville, then known as Limestone Landing.
* Marquis de Lafayette – The 1825 visit of the Marquis de Lafayette to the city, where the city fathers had literally rolled out the red carpet.
* 1850s Sutton&#x27;s Landing – The antebellum-era Maysville riverfront, featuring iconic steam boats on the Ohio River.
* Underground Railroad 1850s – The Underground Railroad route through the area before the American Civil War, with a view looking across the river to the John Rankin House in Ripley, Ohio.
* 20th century Maysville Riverfront – The continuing evolution of the waterfront location as steamboats gave way to trains and barge traffic.
* Market Street – A main street in early 20th century downtown, with a bandstand in the middle of the street.
* Germantown Fair – Held since 1854, the fair featured a wooden grandstand and livestock shows.
* Tobacco barn – A major part of the local agricultural economy, the mural depicts the life of the plant from the field to the harvest to storage in local barns.
* Rosemary Clooney – The last mural, painted in September 2007, honors moments from the life of Rosemary Clooney. The mural highlights her lifelong friendship with Blanche Chambers, the 1953 premier of &quot;The Stars are Singing&quot; and her singing career. It was painted by Dafford, Herb Roe and Brett Chigoy. Her brother Nick Clooney spoke during the dedication for the mural, explaining various images to the crowd.

&quot;The Ledger Independent&quot; is the local newspaper and is published five days a week. WFTM-AM and WFTM-FM are the primary local radio stations in Maysville. The AM station is a CBS Sports Radio affiliate, and the FM plays adult contemporary music.

The annual Rosemary Clooney Music Festival was founded by the singer in 1999 to benefit the restoration of the Russell Theatre. Past performers at the festival include Debby Boone, Rita Coolidge, Michael Feinstein, Roberta Flack, Alison Krauss, The Pointer Sisters, Michael Bolton, and Linda Ronstadt.

==Transportation==
===Rail transportation===

Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides service to Maysville with the thrice-weekly &quot;Cardinal&quot;.

===Mass transit===
Maysville City Transit provides fixed-route and demand-ride bus service throughout city of Maysville. The system is made up of a single fixed route that operates daily, running once an hour from 6:00 AM – 6:00 PM. The city has been running the system since 1960.

===Highways===
The following highways serve Maysville:

* U.S. Route 68, which connects downtown Maysville with Aberdeen, Ohio, via the Simon Kenton Memorial Bridge.
* U.S. Route 62, which passes just west of Maysville and links Kentucky and Ohio via the William H. Harsha Bridge.

US 62 and 68 also provide Maysville with a direct route to Lexington and the Bluegrass Region of Central Kentucky.

Other highways serving Maysville are:
* Kentucky Route 8, which follows the Ohio River west of Maysville to the greater Cincinnati area
* Kentucky Route 9 
* Kentucky Route 10
Routes 9 and 10 run concurrently through the south edge of Maysville as the AA Highway. The AA Highway links the Kentucky suburbs of Cincinnati approximately 50 miles west of Maysville with Vanceburg, Ashland and Interstate 64 near Grayson to the southeast.
* Kentucky Route 11, a north–south highway that approaches Maysville from the south from Flemingsburg and Mt. Sterling.

The fact that highways numbered 8, 9, 10, and 11 serve Maysville makes the city one of the few towns located at the intersection of four consecutively numbered highways.

<text>Paducah ( ) is a home rule-class city in the Upland South, and the county seat of McCracken County, Kentucky, United States. The most populous city in the Jackson Purchase region, it is located in the Southeastern United States at the confluence of the Tennessee and the Ohio rivers, halfway between St. Louis, Missouri, to the northwest and Nashville, Tennessee, to the southeast. As of the 2020 census, the population was 27,137, up from 25,024 in 2010. Twenty blocks of the city&#x27;s downtown have been designated as a historic district and listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Paducah is the principal city of the Paducah metropolitan area, which includes McCracken, Ballard, Carlisle and Livingston counties in Kentucky and Massac County in Illinois. The total population of the metro area was 103,481 in 2020. The Paducah–Mayfield combined statistical area had a total population of 140,138.

==History==
===Early history===
Paducah was first settled as &quot;Pekin&quot; around 1821 by European Americans James and William Pore. The town was laid out by explorer and surveyor William Clark in 1827 and renamed Paducah.

Although local lore long connected this name to an eponymous Chickasaw chief &quot;Paduke&quot; and his band of &quot;Paducahs&quot;, authorities on the Chickasaw have since said that there was never any chief or tribe of that name, or anything like it. The Chickasaw language does not have related words. Instead, historians believe that Clark named the town for the Comanche people of the western plains. They were known by regional settlers as the &quot;Padoucas&quot;, from a Spanish transliteration of the Kaw word &quot;Pádoka&quot; or the Omaha &quot;Pádoⁿka&quot;.

===Incorporation, steamboats and railroads===
Paducah was formally established as a town in 1830 and incorporated as a city by the state legislature in 1838. The city charter was drafted by Quintus Quincy Quigley and H. Clay King in 1856.

By this time, steam boats traversed the river system, and its port facilities were important to trade and transportation. In addition, developing railroads began to enter the region. A factory for making red bricks, and a foundry for making rail and locomotive components became the nucleus of a thriving &quot;River and Rail&quot; economy. Paducah became the site of dry dock facilities for steamboats and towboats, and thus headquarters for many barge companies. Because of its proximity to coalfields further to the east in Kentucky and north in Illinois, Paducah also became an important railway hub for the Illinois Central Railroad. This was the primary north–south railway connecting the industrial cities of Chicago and East St. Louis to the Gulf of Mexico at Gulfport, Mississippi, and New Orleans, Louisiana. The Illinois Central system also provided east–west links to the Burlington Northern and the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railways (which later merged to become the BNSF Railway).

In 1924 the Illinois Central Railroad began construction at Paducah of their largest locomotive workshop in the nation. Over a period of 190 days, a large ravine between Washington and Jones streets was filled with 44,560 carloads of dirt to enlarge the site, sufficient for the construction of 23 buildings. The eleven million dollar project was completed in 1927 as the fourth-largest industrial plant in Kentucky. The railroad became the largest employer in Paducah, having 1,075 employees in 1938.

As steam locomotives were replaced through the 1940s and 1950s, the Paducah shops were converted to maintain diesel locomotives. A nationally known rebuilding program for aging diesel locomotives from Illinois Central and other railroads began in 1967. The shops became part of the Paducah and Louisville Railway in 1986. In the early 21st century, they are operated by VMV Paducahbilt.

===Civil War===
At the outset of the Civil War, Kentucky attempted to take a neutral position. However, when a Confederate force occupied Columbus, a Union force under General Ulysses S. Grant responded by occupying Paducah. Throughout most of the war, Col. Stephen G. Hicks was in charge of Paducah, and the town served as a massive supply depot for Federal forces along the Ohio, Mississippi, and Tennessee river systems.

On December 17, 1862, under the terms of General Order No. 11, US forces required 30 Jewish families to leave their long-established homes. Grant was trying to break up a black market in cotton, in which he assumed Jewish traders were involved due to racial stereotyping associated with anti-Semitic tropes. Cesar Kaskel, a prominent local Jewish businessman, dispatched a telegram of complaint to President Lincoln and met with him. As there were similar actions taken by other Jewish businessmen and loud complaints by Congress about the treatment of their constituents, Lincoln ordered the policy to be revoked within a few weeks.

On March 25, 1864, Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest raided Paducah as part of his campaign northward from Mississippi into Western Tennessee and Kentucky. He intended to re-supply the Confederate forces in the region with recruits, ammunition, medical supplies, horses and mules, and especially to disrupt the Union domination of the regions south of the Ohio River. Known as the Battle of Paducah, the raid was successful in terms of the re-supply effort and in intimidating the Union, but Forrest returned south. According to his report, &quot;I drove the enemy to their gunboats and fort; and held the city for ten hours, captured many stores and horses; burned sixty bales of cotton, one steamer, and a drydock, bringing out fifty prisoners.&quot; Much of the fighting took place around Fort Anderson on the city&#x27;s west side, in the present-day Lower Town neighborhood; most buildings in the neighborhood postdate the war, as most of the neighborhood was demolished soon after the battle to deny any future raids the advantage of surprise that they had enjoyed during the battle. Among the few houses that were not destroyed is the David Yeiser House, a single-story Greek Revival structure.

Later having read in the newspapers that 140 fine horses had escaped the raid, Forrest sent Brigadier General Abraham Buford back to Paducah, to get the horses and to keep Union forces busy there while he attacked Fort Pillow in Tennessee. His forces were charged with a massacre of United States Colored Troops among the Union forces whom they defeated at the fort. On April 14, 1864, Buford&#x27;s men found the horses hidden in a Paducah foundry, as reported by the newspapers. Buford rejoined Forrest with the spoils, leaving the Union in control of Paducah until the end of the War.

===1937 flood===

In a far-reaching flood, on January 21, 1937, the Ohio River at Paducah rose above its flood stage, cresting at on February 2 and receding again to 50 feet on February 15. For nearly three weeks, 27,000 residents were forced to flee or to stay with friends and relatives on higher ground in McCracken or other counties. The American Red Cross and local churches provided some shelters. Buildings in downtown Paducah still bear historic plaques that define the high water marks.

Driven by of rainfall in 16 days, along with sheets of swiftly moving ice, the Ohio River flood of 1937 was the worst natural disaster in Paducah&#x27;s history and elsewhere in the Ohio Valley. The earthen levee was ineffective against this flood. As a result, Congress authorized the United States Army Corps of Engineers to build the flood wall that now protects the city.

===Atomic City===

In 1950, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission selected Paducah as the site for a new uranium enrichment plant. Construction began in 1951 and the plant opened for operations in 1952. Originally operated by Union Carbide, the plant has changed hands several times. Martin Marietta, its successor company Lockheed-Martin, and now the United States Enrichment Corporation have operated the plant in turn. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), successor to the AEC, remains the owner. The plant was closed in June 2013, and the Department of Energy began the process of decontaminating and shutting down the facilities.

===Quilt City===
On April 25, 1991, the National Quilt Museum opened in downtown Paducah. Paducah has been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network in the category of craft and folk art since November 2013. The national quilt show takes place yearly at the Schroeder Expo Center. The American Quilter&#x27;s Society hosts a week of quilt shows with quilt classes, fabric shops and a variety of vendors. They host a variety of award-winning quilts from across the country. The show features exhibits that include hand pieced and appliqued quilts, Kentucky heritage quilts, and Paducah contest quilts.

===The Heath shooting===

On December 1, 1997, 14-year-old Michael Carneal brought five loaded guns to Heath High School and shot a group of fellow students in the school&#x27;s lobby as they were leaving a prayer group before school. Three students, all girls, were killed and five others were wounded; one of the wounded was left a paraplegic. Carneal subsequently received a sentence of life with the possibility of parole after 25 years. In 2022, the Kentucky Parole Board denied his bid for parole.

==Arts and culture==
=== Art ===
==== Murals ====

In 1996, the Paducah Wall to Wall mural program was begun by the Louisiana mural artist Robert Dafford and his team on the floodwall in downtown Paducah. They have painted more than 50 murals addressing numerous subjects, including Native American history, industries such as river barges and hospitals, local African-American heritage, the historic Carnegie Library on Broadway Street, steamboats, and local labor unions.

In May 2003, photographer Jim Roshan documented the painting of the Lewis and Clark Expedition mural during the America 24/7 project. One of the images was used in the book &quot;Kentucky24/7&quot;, published in 2004.

By 2008 the mural project was completed and being maintained. Muralist Herb Roe returned to the city each year to repaint and refurbish the panels. Roe is the only muralist associated with the project to have worked on all of the panels. Roe added a new mural to the project in the summer of 2010. It shows the 100-year history of the local Boy Scout troop, Troop 1. Troop 1 is one of only a handful of troops who share their centennial with that of the national scouting organization itself. The dedication for the mural was held on National Scout Sunday, February 6, 2011.

In 2017, artist Char Downs debuted the newest addition to the Wall to Wall mural program: a series of murals of award-winning quilts on the floodwall facing Park Street. Downs invested nearly 500 hours recreating Caryl Bryer Fallert-Gentry&#x27;s historic award-winning quilt Corona II: Solar Eclipse—the first quilt in the series—in her studio in Paducah&#x27;s Lower Town Arts District.

The Paducah Art Alliance has a program of Artist in Residencies to bring respected artists in to the city. In 2018 British Artist Ian Berry came and put on an exhibition to great acclaim. Ian is famed around the world with his art in denim, and fitted in with the textile art that Paducah is known for.

==== Lower Town Artist Relocation Program ====
In August 2000, Paducah&#x27;s Artist Relocation Program was started to offer incentives for artists to relocate to its historic downtown and Lower Town areas. The program has become a national model for using the arts for economic development. It has received the Governors Award in the Arts, the Distinguished Planning Award from the Kentucky Chapter of the American Planning Association, the American Planning Association&#x27;s National Planning Award, and most recently, the Kentucky League of Cities&#x27; Enterprise Cities Award.

Lower Town, home of the Artist Relocation Program, is the oldest neighborhood in Paducah. As retail commerce moved toward the outskirts of the city, efforts were made to preserve the architectural character, and historic Victorian structures were restored in the older parts of the city. The artists&#x27; housing program contributed to that effort and became a catalyst for revitalizing the downtown area. The Luther F. Carson Center for the Performing Arts was completed in downtown Paducah in 2004.

==== UNESCO Creative City ====
On November 21, 2013, Paducah was designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as a Creative City of Crafts and Folk Art. Arts and cultural initiatives have included the Lower Town Artist Relocation program, the National Quilt Museum, Paducah &quot;Wall to Wall&quot; floodwall murals, and the Paducah School of Art and Design. Participation in the program has been criticized by local business owners and by Paducah&#x27;s economic development council due to the financial cost to the city, and because the &quot;UNESCO Creative Cities Network only benefits a small portion of Paducah&#x27;s economy&quot;.

=== Music ===
The Luther F. Carson Center for the Performing Arts was completed in downtown Paducah in 2004. From Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash to Garrison Keillor, Shanghai Circus to STOMP, the Carson Center hosts touring Broadway productions, well-known entertainers, dramas, dance and popular faith-based and family series.

In September 2004, plans came together to highlight Paducah&#x27;s musical roots through the redevelopment of the southern side of downtown. The centerpiece of the effort is the renovation of Maggie Steed&#x27;s Hotel Metropolitan.[28] Prominent African-American musicians such as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Chick Webb&#x27;s orchestra, B.B. King, Bobby &quot;Blue&quot; Bland, Ike and Tina Turner and other R &amp; B and blues legends have performed here as part of what has become known as the &quot;Chitlin&#x27; Circuit&quot;. Supporters want to promote Paducah&#x27;s role in the history of American music.

Paducah is the birthplace and residence of musicians in various genres. Rockabilly Hall of Fame artists Ray Smith, whose recording of &quot;Rockin&#x27; Little Angel&quot; was a hit in 1960, and Stanley Walker, who played guitar for Ray Smith and others, grew up in Paducah. Terry Mike Jeffrey, an Emmy-nominated songwriter, is a resident of Paducah. Nashville, Tennessee–based composer–violinist, Mark Evitts, is also from Paducah. The most prominent mainstream artist is Steven Curtis Chapman, the top-selling Christian artist of all time.

Paducah is one of only two cities named in the world-famous song &quot;Hooray for Hollywood&quot;, which is used as the opening number for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Awards (the Oscars). The 1937 song, with music by Richard Whiting and lyrics by Johnny Mercer, contains in the second verse: &quot;Hooray for Hollywood! That phony, super Coney, Hollywood. They come from Chilicothes and Padukahs...&quot;

Both cities were misspelled in the original published lyrics, though that may have been the fault of the publishers rather than Mercer. He was noted for his sophistication and the attention to detail he put into his lyrics. The correct spellings are &quot;Chillicothe&quot; and &quot;Paducah&quot;.

==Sports==
Paducah was home to professional baseball&#x27;s minor league Class D Kentucky–Illinois–Tennessee League (or KITTY League) Paducah Paddys (1903), Paducah Indians (1904–06, 1910, 1914, 1922–23, 1936–41), Paducah Polecats (1911), Paducah Chiefs (1912–13, 1951–55), and Paducah Redbirds (1935). The Chiefs competed in the Mississippi-Ohio Valley League from 1949 to 1950.

The Chiefs played in J. Polk Brooks Stadium from its opening in 1948 until the KITTY League folded after the 1955 season. Since then, the ballpark has served as the home venue for Paducah Tilghman High School and American Legion Post 31 baseball teams, as well as various special baseball games and tournaments. In recent years, Brooks Stadium hosted the Ohio Valley Conference baseball tournament (2001–2009) and the National Club Baseball Association World Series (2015 and 2016). Brooks Stadium currently is the home field for the Paducah Chiefs of the Ohio Valley Summer Collegiate Baseball League.

In 1969, the Paducah Community College Indians won the National Junior College men&#x27;s basketball championship.

The Paducah International Raceway is a 3/8-mile motorsport racetrack built in 1972.

==Government==

Paducah operates under a council–manager form of city government. The Paducah Board of Commissioners is made up of the mayor and four commissioners elected at-large by the citizens on a non-partisan basis. The mayor is elected for a four-year term and commissioners each for a two-year term. The mayor and council select and appoint a city manager to operate the city.

==Education==
Paducah Public Schools operates public schools serving most of the City of Paducah. Three K-5 elementary schools, Clark Elementary School, McNabb Elementary School and Morgan Elementary School, serve the city. All district residents are zoned to Paducah Middle School and Paducah Tilghman High School.

Parts of the city and surrounding county are instead served by the McCracken County Public Schools. Concord Elementary School and Reidland Elementary/Intermediate serve students through the 5th grade; Lone Oak Elementary School and Hendron–Lone Oak Elementary School end at the third grade, with 4th and 5th grade students in those schools&#x27; attendance zones attending Lone Oak Intermediate School. Middle school students in those areas may be zoned into Heath, Lone Oak, or Reidland Middle School. The county district began operating a single, consolidated McCracken County High School on August 9, 2013. The Paducah city district did not participate in this consolidation and Paducah Tilghman High School remains separate.

Paducah is also home to two private school systems, St. Mary High School and Community Christian Academy.

===Higher education===
West Kentucky Community and Technical College (WKCTC) is a member of the Kentucky Community and Technical College System and is a public, two-year, degree-granting institution serving the Western Region of Kentucky. There are approximately 6,200 students enrolled at the college. WKCTC was rated as one of the top 10 community colleges in the United States by the Aspen Institute for 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2017.

There is a Paducah campus of the University of Kentucky College of Engineering located on the WKCTC campus.

Paducah is one of three control cities of the Paducah-Cape Girardeau-Harrisburg media market, and is served by all the major network affiliates in the market. Locally, television stations in Paducah include NBC affiliate WPSD-TV, MyNetworkTV affiliate WDKA (a sister station to Cape Girardeau-based Fox affiliate KBSI), and Kentucky Educational Television satellite station WKPD. Paducah was also previously home to WQWQ-LD, which served as the area&#x27;s affiliate of The CW. That station now operates from Cape Girardeau as the market&#x27;s Telemundo affiliate, but still nominally licensed in Paducah.

Six radio stations are located in Paducah; half of the stations are owned by Bristol Broadcasting Company.

The main print outlet is the regional daily newspaper &quot;The Paducah Sun&quot;, owned by Paxton Media Group, which owns WPSD. The weekly newspapers, the &quot;West Kentucky News&quot; and &quot;The Good Neighbor&quot;, enjoy significant readership.

The bi-monthly magazine &quot;Paducah Life&quot; debuted in 1994 and continues publication today. The magazine features articles about life and residents in and around Paducah. &quot;Purchase Area Family Magazine&quot;, a monthly publication distributed throughout Western Kentucky and Metropolis, Illinois, debuted in 2003. The magazine features a comprehensive calendar of events for the Purchase Area as well as unique articles about events, organizations and activities for families in the region.

<text>Calhoun is a home rule-class city in McLean County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 725 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of McLean County. It is included in the Owensboro, Kentucky Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Present-day Calhoun was first known as &quot;Rhoadsville&quot; after the German-born Pennsylvanian Captain Henry Rhoads (1739–1809), who laid out the town from 1784 to 1785 near the Long Falls of the Green River. His brother Solomon then erected a fort to protect the settlers and the transit around the falls.

Around the time John Hanley acquired Rhoads&#x27; lands in a 1787 lawsuit, the site was renamed and was alternately known as &quot;Fort Vienna&quot; and &quot;Vienna Station&quot;. The post office established in 1849, however, was called &quot;Calhoon&quot; after Rep. John Calhoon of Kentucky, and the town was chartered by the state assembly in 1852 under this new name. At some later point, presumably out of confusion with the more famous Senator and Vice President John Calhoun of South Carolina, the spelling of the town was changed.

In 1854, it beat out the settlement of Rumsey on the other side of the river to become the seat of the newly formed McLean County.

==Geography==
Calhoun is located in central McLean County at (37.538633, -87.259414), on the north bank of the Green River, the longest river entirely in the state. The Army Corps of Engineers&#x27; Lock and Dam #2 on the river is at Calhoun. Calhoun is bordered to the south, across the river, by the community of Rumsey.

Kentucky Route 81 passes through Calhoun as its Main Street, leading north to Owensboro and south to Central City. Kentucky Route 256 leaves the center of Calhoun as 1st Street and leads northwest to Beech Grove. Kentucky Route 136 crosses the northern end of Calhoun, leading northwest to Beech Grove as well and southeast to Livermore.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Calhoun has a total area of , of which , or 2.39%, are water.

==Climate==
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Calhoun has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Livermore () is a home rule-class city located at the confluence of the Green and Rough rivers in McLean County in the U.S. state of Kentucky. The population was 1,230 as of the 2020 census, down from 1,365 in 2010. It is included in the Owensboro metropolitan area.

==History==

===Early years===
William Brown founded the city in 1837 as &quot;Brown&#x27;s Landing&quot;, but the post office established the next year took the name Livermore. The origin is disputed: some historians trace it to an otherwise-unknown shopkeeper named James Livermore, others to civil engineer Alonzo Livermore who helped construct a dam across the Green River at Rumsey. The city was formally incorporated by the state assembly in 1850.

===Opera house lynching===
Livermore achieved national and international notoriety in the second decade of the 20th century for a bizarre lynching. On April 20, 1911, a black man named Will Porter (or Potter) shot and wounded Clarence Mitchell, a white man, after a barroom argument. Sheriff V.P. Stabler then arrested Porter. After this, accounts vary. The &quot;New York Times&quot; account holds that a local mob of fifty overwhelmed the sheriff, who had hid Porter in the opera house basement to protect him. They then bound Porter&#x27;s hands and feet, took him to the center stage, and shot him there. Another version reported by several Kentucky papers omitted the sheriff&#x27;s concern and had Porter taken from the jail to the opera house, where admission was charged to witness the hanging. Those in the gallery were permitted a single shot at Porter; those in the orchestra seats were allowed to empty their guns.

The NAACP quickly condemned the lynching and sent letters to President Taft, the Congress, and Governor Willson of Kentucky. At Willson&#x27;s insistence, Kentucky issued warrants for 18 of the lynchers; three leaders – including Mitchell&#x27;s brother Lawrence – were separately indicted and tried for murder, but quickly acquitted. At the time of the indictments, it was locally reported that Clarence Mitchell, &quot;the young white man&quot; whose shooting had enraged the Livermore mob, &quot;has since fully recovered, and has married.&quot; Following acquittal of the three ringleaders in fall 1911, indictments of the remaining 15 were &quot;filed away&quot; and appear to have never been brought to trial. In 1915, both presiding Judge T. F. Birkhead and Commonwealth Attorney Ben D. Ringo were defeated for reelection, Birkhead receiving not one vote from McLean County.

==Geography==
Livermore is located in eastern McLean County at (37.490987, -87.135340), on the north side of the Green River and Rough River. It is bordered to the south, across the Rough River, by Ohio County.

<text>Hardcore Jollies is the ninth studio album by the funk rock band Funkadelic, released on October 29, 1976 by Warner Bros. Records, their first album to be issued on a major label. It is dedicated to &quot;the guitar players of the world.&quot; Originally, the first side of the album was called &quot;Osmosis Phase 1&quot; and the second side was &quot;Terribitus Phase 2.&quot; &quot;Hardcore Jollies&quot; was released one month after Funkadelic&#x27;s final album for Westbound Records, &quot;Tales of Kidd Funkadelic&quot;, which was recorded during the same sessions.

&quot;Hardcore Jollies&quot; was the last Parliament-Funkadelic studio album to include three of the original members of The Parliaments: Fuzzy Haskins, Calvin Simon and Grady Thomas. Though uncredited, &quot;Hardcore Jollies&quot; features instrumental performances by guitarist Eddie Hazel.

The album has been reissued on compact disc by Charly Groove Records and Priority Records.

Brandenburg was built on a tract of land called &quot;Falling Springs&quot;, purchased in 1804 by Solomon Brandenburg. He opened a tavern around which the community grew. In 1825, the community became the seat of Meade County, but it wasn&#x27;t formally incorporated by the state assembly until March 28, 1872.

During the Civil War, Confederate General John Hunt Morgan crossed at Brandenburg to start his raid into Indiana in July 1863. During the Battle of Brandenburg Crossing, two men on the Indiana side of the river were killed by cannon fire from Brandenburg. A Union gunship was deployed to block the crossing, but it ran out of ammunition and Morgan and his men were able to pass into Indiana.

Brandenburg was devastated by an F5 tornado during the Super Outbreak of April 3, 1974. The tornado had touched down near Hardinsburg and as it moved to the northeast grew into a half-mile wide wedge tornado, striking Brandenburg head on. The tornado killed 31 people and injured 270, with all but three of the fatalities and most of the injuries occurring at Brandenburg. 128 homes and 30 businesses were also destroyed. There was no early warning from tornado sirens or NOAA Weather Wire Service about the storm. About an hour after the storm, the same supercell spawned an F4 tornado that formed in the southwest part of Louisville in Jefferson County near Kosmosdale. Three people lost their lives in this storm, but it also left two hundred and seven injuries. The Brandenburg tornado remains as the only F5/EF5 tornado in Kentucky state history since official record keeping began in 1950, although later that day another F5 that hit Cincinnati, Ohio crossed the Ohio River from Indiana into Kentucky then into Ohio.

The Confederate Monument in Louisville was relocated to Brandenburg in late 2017 and rededicated in 2018.

<text>Harrodsburg is a home rule-class city in Mercer County, Kentucky, United States. It is the seat of its county. The population was 9,064 at the 2020 census.

Although Harrodsburg was formally established by the Virginia House of Burgesses after Boonesborough and was not incorporated by the Kentucky legislature until 1836, it was honored by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as the oldest permanent American settlement west of the Appalachians.

==History==
===18th century===
Harrodstown (sometimes Harrod&#x27;s Town) was laid out and founded by James Harrod on June 16, 1774. Harrod led a company of adventurers totaling 31 men, beginning in the spring of 1774 at Fort Redstone in Pennsylvania down the Monongahela and Ohio Rivers in canoes and through a series of other rivers and creeks to the town&#x27;s present-day location.

Later that same year, amid Dunmore&#x27;s War, Lord Dunmore sent two men to warn the surveyors of imminent Shawnee attacks, Daniel Boone and Michael Stoner, who are said to have completed the round trip of 800 miles in 61 days. Regardless, the pioneers remained for a few weeks until a man was killed by the natives, when the settlement was abandoned and resettled the following year by March. It was one of three settlements in present-day Kentucky at the time the Thirteen Colonies declared independence in 1776, along with Logan&#x27;s Fort and Boonesborough. Also known as Oldtown, Harrodstown was the first seat of Virginia&#x27;s Kentucky (1776), Lincoln (1780), and Mercer (1785) Counties upon their formations. It remains the seat of Mercer County in Kentucky.

A census taken between Dec. 16, 1777, and Oct. 16, 1778, lists 52 residents, several of whom were well-known pioneers and frontiersmen, including Daniel Boone&#x27;s younger brother, Squire Boone, Silas Harlan, the Kentucky county&#x27;s namesake, James Harrod, Hugh McGary, Isaac Hite and his cousins, Isaac and John Bowman, and David Glenn, who later travelled further west and settled in Yellow Banks (present Daviess County). David Glenn, along with his brother Thomas, and Silas Harlan, with his brother James, had accompanied Harrod on his initial expedition in 1774.

The settlement was formally established by the Virginia General Assembly in 1785 as Harrodsburg. Four years later, it was named the location for the newly created United States District Court for the District of Kentucky by the Judiciary Act of 1789.

===19th century===
The Kentucky General Assembly incorporated Harrodsburg in 1836.

During the Civil War, the town was pro-Confederate, but Union control permitted the organization two Union regiments, the 19th Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Infantry and the 11th Regiment Kentucky Volunteer Cavalry. The 19th Infantry as organized at nearby Camp Harwood for a three-year enlistment commencing January 2, 1862, under the command of Colonel William J. Landram. Companies A, C, D, and F of the 11th Kentucky Cavalry were organized at Harrodsburg, Kentucky, in July 1862. The remainder of the regiment was organized in Louisville, Kentucky, and mustered in on September 26, 1862, for three years service under the command of Colonel Alexander W. Holeman. Following the Battle of Perryville, much of the city was converted into makeshift hospitals; 1600 sick and wounded Confederate soldiers were captured during a raid by the 9th Kentucky Cavalry under Lieutenant Colonel John Boyle on October 10, 1862. The city then remained under martial law for the remainder of the war.

The Louisville Southern Railroad network reached the city in 1888. Its construction commenced in 1884 and ran from Louisville through Shelbyville and Lawrenceburg to Harrodsburg, which was reached in 1888. A spur was constructed to Burgin, where the Louisville Southern joined the Cincinnati Southern&#x27;s Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway CNO&amp;TP mainline. Now all run and are operated by Norfolk Southern Railway.

===20th century===
Pioneer Memorial Park (now Old Fort Harrod State Park) was opened on June 16, 1927. In 1936, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt honored the city with a monument honoring the &quot;first permanent settlement west of the Appalachians&quot;.

<doc id="115363" wikidata="Q945800" url="?curid=115363" title="Fountain Run, Kentucky">
<text>Fountain Run is a home rule-class city in Monroe County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 216 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Fountain Run was originally called &quot;Jamestown&quot;. The order establishing Jamestown on of land owned by Jacob Goodman Sr. was entered in Barren County Court Order Book #4 during November Court, 1816. Jamestown, located in Monroe County after 1820, appears in public records and on maps with this name through the Civil War. The name was changed to &quot;Fountain Run&quot; for the new post office (1856) because of Jamestown, already established as the county seat of Russell County.

Fountain Run was formally incorporated by the state legislature in 1908.

Although not historically recorded as such, the name &quot;Fountain Run&quot; is traditionally believed to refer to the town&#x27;s spring and stream branch, perhaps reminiscent of &quot;run&quot; as a name for streams in colonial Virginia.

&quot;Jimtown&quot; (diminutive of Jamestown) as a nickname for the town and community persisted after the new postal name of &quot;Fountain Run&quot; was created. For example, the &quot;Glasgow and Jimtown turnpike road&quot; was authorized by an act of the Kentucky Legislature (Chapter 906), February 17, 1866, as a toll road between Glasgow and Fountain Run via currently marked Kentucky Route 249, Kentucky Route 921, Defeated Creek Road, and Kentucky Route 87—see the 1879 Barren County map which reveals the most improved route of that era. This new toll road followed the route of the old &quot;[Thomas] Flippin road&quot; (est. 1799) to Dry Fork—Kentucky Route 249 today, then turned at the intersection to proceed via the current route of Highway 921 to Defeated Creek Road. The act also provided for a toll road branch that continued from Dry Fork via the Flippin road (a.k.a. Pikesville road after 1818) toward the &quot;forks of Indian Creek&quot;—also Kentucky Route 249 as straightened and improved, today. This incorporated toll road and its branch road later reverted to public roads maintained by the local magistrates, but Kentucky Route 249 retained its moniker as the &quot;Jimtown Road&quot; well into the 20th century. Today, this route from Glasgow to Flippin and Fountain Run is more commonly known as the &quot;Roseville Road&quot;.

Famed musician Billy Vaughn from Glasgow, Kentucky composed (1968) the song, &quot;The Jimtown Road&quot;, inspired by this historic Barren County route, which was recorded (1969) by The Mills Brothers, although the song&#x27;s lyrics are mostly veiled references about Glasgow and Bowling Green, Kentucky, instead of Fountain Run.

Jimtown Academy was established in 1897 in Fountain Run as a school of private instruction that included &quot;primary and preparatory departments&quot;, with W. B. Robinson as principal. Fountain Run elementary and high schools were also located here until consolidated.

The Monroe County section of &quot;Kentucky: A History of the State&quot; (1886) includes brief biographies of some prominent 19th-century citizens of the Fountain Run community. Two booklets authored by local resident Lucy Albright (1903–1985) have been widely recognized as sources of the traditional history of Fountain Run and of genealogies of some early families of the community. Histories of Monroe County that include this community have been more recently published.

==Geography==
Fountain Run is located at (36.721319, -85.961398) in western Monroe County, near the point where Allen, Monroe, and Barren counties come together. Kentucky Route 100 passes through the south side of the community, leading east to Tompkinsville, the county seat, and west to Scottsville. Kentucky Route 87 passes through the center of Fountain Run, leading northwest to its terminus at Barren River Lake State Resort Park and south toward Lafayette, Tennessee, away.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Fountain Run has a total area of , of which , or 0.08%, are water. Spring Creek runs along the eastern border of the city, and Jakes Branch drains the western part; both streams flow south to Indian Creek, just west of its mouth at the Barren River, part of the Green River watershed.

<text>Gamaliel () is a home rule-class city in Monroe County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 391 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Around 1836, James Crawford and John Hayes saw that a town was springing up and donated of land, at a point where their farms met, to be used for educational and religious purposes. On this property, a building was erected and used for school and church and, in 1844, a cemetery was added. In making the grant, the two men stipulated that seven trustees should be appointed to administer the property along the lines provided by the donors. The original trustees were William Crawford, Maston Comer, John Hayes, Robert Welch, James Crawford Jr., Charles Browning Jr., and John Meador. This act of incorporation was passed by the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Kentucky on December 19, 1840.

Samuel DeWitt, a local preacher and teacher, said &quot;Gamaliel&quot; was a good biblical name for a good village. (In the Book of Acts, the Pharisee appears speaking in favor of recently arrested Christians.) The town took the name that he suggested. A post office was established in the community in 1870.

==Geography==
Gamaliel is located in southern Monroe County at (36.639956, -85.793372). It is north of the Tennessee border. Kentucky Route 100 passes through the center of town, leading northeast to Tompkinsville, the county seat, and northwest to Fountain Run. Kentucky Route 63 leaves town to the northeast with KY 100 but leads south from town to the state line, where it becomes Tennessee State Route 56, which continues to Red Boiling Springs, south of Gamaliel. Kentucky Route 87 leads southwest from Gamaliel to Bugtussle at the state line, then farther as Tennessee State Route 261 to Lafayette, Tennessee.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Gamaliel has a total area of , of which , or 0.49%, are water. The city sits on a hill between the East Fork of the Barren River to the north and its tributary Line Creek to the south. The Barren River is part of the Green River watershed leading to the Ohio River.

<text>Mount Sterling, often written as Mt. Sterling, is a home rule-class city in Montgomery County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 7,558 as of the 2020 census, up from 6,895 in 2010. It is the county seat of Montgomery County and the principal city of the Mount Sterling micropolitan area.

==History==
Mount Sterling is named for an ancient burial mound called &quot;Little Mountain&quot;, and for the town of Stirling in Scotland. It was named by the first developer of the area, Hugh Forbes. The Kentucky Assembly passed an act in 1792 establishing the town as Mt. Sterling, a misspelling which was retained.

The area was originally part of the thick wilderness of central Kentucky. Explorers, hunters, and surveyors traveling along a trail called Old Harper&#x27;s Trace noted a tree-covered mound which they called &quot;the Little Mountain&quot;. Later excavations showed it to be a burial site. The site of the mound is now the intersection of Queen and Locust streets in Mt. Sterling.

The first cabin in the area was built in 1779. The first permanent settlement was established around 1790, when Forbes began to sell lots and laid out a road, now Locust Street. In 1796 the town was established as the county seat of newly created Montgomery County. At that time the town consisted of 33 town lots, four retail stores, and three taverns. A courthouse was built, the first of seven to be housed in Mt. Sterling. A jail and a town pump were also installed. A large brick market house where farm produce was bought and sold confirmed the town as the commercial center of the surrounding area. Baptist, Presbyterian and Methodist churches were established during the town&#x27;s first decade.

During the Civil War the town was occupied alternately by Union and Confederate troops on multiple occasions. The Battle of Mount Sterling in June 1864, which ended in a Confederate defeat, was the last of the fighting in Montgomery County.

<doc id="115369" wikidata="Q2485102" url="?curid=115369" title="West Liberty, Kentucky">
<text>West Liberty is a home rule-class city in Morgan County, Kentucky, United States. It is the county seat of Morgan County. As of the 2020 census, the city population was 3,215. It is located along the Licking River at the junction of Kentucky Route 7 and U.S. Route 460.

==History==
By 1816, an early settlement at the town site was called &quot;Wells Mills&quot;. When Morgan County was founded in 1823, the settlement was incorporated to become the county seat. It chose the name &quot;West Liberty&quot; in the belief that Pikeville, Kentucky, would be called &quot;Liberty&quot; when it incorporated. West Liberty is actually east of Liberty, Kentucky.

Three Civil War skirmishes were fought near West Liberty, and much of the town was burned during the war, including the courthouse. It was replaced after the war, and a fourth courthouse was built in 1907.

===2012 tornado===

On March 2, 2012, West Liberty was hit by an EF-3 tornado which caused extensive damage to the downtown area. This tornado left a swath of damage over a mile wide. Many homes and businesses were heavily damaged or destroyed. Six people were killed and at least 75 people were injured. Preliminary assessments from emergency officials and media indicated a path length of 60 miles (97 km), though a National Weather Service survey concluded the tornado travelled 85 miles from Menifee County to Lincoln County, West Virginia. It had the longest track of any tornado in the United States in 2012.

The old courthouse, built in 1907, as well as the new courthouse which was 60% completed were at first, after the tornado, both deemed as a total loss. However, this determination was in error as both buildings have been restored and finished, respectively.

The tornado had also hit the city of Wellington in Menifee County and was just north of the EF3 tornado that hit Salyersville around 7:00 PM Eastern time that evening. The tornadoes were the worst in the history of all three of the towns.

===Restoration after tornado===
Since the 2012 tornado, much progress has been made in West Liberty. Many of the buildings destroyed in the disaster have been either rebuilt to prior state or have been replaced with much better structures. Planning in West Liberty has been continuous since the disaster.

<text>Central City is a home rule-class city in Muhlenberg County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 5,819 at the 2020 census. It is the largest city in the county and the principal community in the Central City Micropolitan Statistical Area, which includes all of Muhlenberg County.

==History==

The site of present-day Central City was originally known as &quot;Morehead&#x27;s Horse Mill&quot; after local resident Charles S. Morehead&#x27;s steam-powered gristmill. A larger community began to develop after the 1870 advent of the Elizabethtown and Paducah Railroad. A post office was constructed the next year in 1871 and called &quot;Owensboro Junction&quot; after the projected 1872 completion of the Owensboro and Russellville Railroad. By 1873, the settlement was large enough to be incorporated by the state legislature as &quot;Stroud City&quot;, after local landowner John Stroud.

The same year, however, the du Ponts&#x27; Central Coal and Iron Company began operation in the area and became so vital to the local economy that the city was reïncorporated in 1882 as &quot;Central City&quot;. Recessions replaced the E&amp;P and the O&amp;R with a procession of different companies, including the Owensboro and Nashville Railway, but the two rights of way always remained in separate hands, keeping Central City an important regional hub for the Illinois Central and the L&amp;N, with train yards, roundhouses, and even an elevated rail station. Coal was mined from nearby fields, prompting explosions such as one in 1912 that killed five workers.

The expansion of automotive traffic in the early 20th century reduced some of Central City&#x27;s importance, but it continues to service mainline freight traffic on the Paducah and Louisville Railway and trunk-line service for CSX from Madisonville to the Paradise Combined Cycle Plant, minutes south of the city.

==Geography==
Central City is located in northeastern Muhlenberg County at (37.294989, -87.128622). The Western Kentucky Parkway runs along the southern edge of the city, with access from Exit 58 (U.S. Route 431). The parkway leads northeast to Elizabethtown and west to Eddyville. U.S. Route 62 passes through Central City south of the city center; it leads northeast to Beaver Dam and southwest to Greenville, the Muhlenberg county seat. US 431 passes through Central City&#x27;s downtown, leading north to Owensboro and south to Russellville.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Central City has a total area of , of which , or 0.21%, are water. Terrain in Central City is rolling hills to steep bluffs along the northern boundaries of the city along the Green River. The city, along its northwestern border, is known for its swamps and lowland area that remain at or near the water table year-round.

Most of Central City has a sandstone bedrock with #9 bituminous coal underlying the bedrock. Central City has a number of old underground coal mine shafts that still crisscross the city. Most of these old shafts date back to the early 1900s. The majority of terrain around the city limits is reclaimed land where surface mining has taken place.

<text>Bardstown is a home rule-class city in Nelson County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 13,567 in the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Nelson County.

Bardstown is named for the pioneering Bard brothers. David Bard obtained a land grant in 1785 in what was then Jefferson County, Virginia. William Bard surveyed and platted the town. It was originally chartered as Baird&#x27;s Town in 1788, and has been known as Beardstown, and Beards Town. The production of bourbon whiskey is a major industry.

==History==
First settled by European Americans in 1780, Bardstown is among the oldest cities in Kentucky. Named county seat of the newly created Nelson County, Virginia (now Kentucky) in 1784, the town was formally established in 1788. It was incorporated by the state assembly in 1838.

Reflecting the westward migration of Americans over the Blue Ridge Mountains after the Revolutionary War, Bardstown was also the first center of Catholicism west of the Appalachian Mountains in the original western frontier territories of the United States. The Diocese of Bardstown was established on February 8, 1808, to serve all Catholics between the Appalachians and the Mississippi River. This divided the previous all-encompassing Diocese of Baltimore, established in 1789. In 1841, the seat of the diocese was transferred to nearby Louisville, Kentucky. The Bardstown cathedral is the Basilica of Saint Joseph Proto-Cathedral, and the city has a Roman Catholic parochial high school, Bethlehem High School.

In 2008, videos showing sewage and storm water spewing from the sewer systems in multiple locations around the city led the state of Kentucky to order the city to fix the problem. The sewer system was fixed in 2016.

<text>Bloomfield is a home rule–class city in Nelson County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 838 during the 2010 U.S. census. Former names of the city included Middlesburg and Gandertown.

==History==
The community on the east fork of Simpson Creek originally grew up on sites purchased from Leven Powell&#x27;s land grant, which he received from the state of Virginia in 1779 and surveyed in 1781. The community on the east bank of the creek was known as &quot;Middlesburg&quot; when its first post office opened in 1803; the west bank was known as &quot;Gandertown&quot; from its sport of &quot;ganderpulling&quot;. Dr. John Bemiss of Rochester, New York, had settled in the area in 1799; in 1817, he laid out the town and renamed it &quot;Bloomfield&quot;, supposedly after his wife&#x27;s maiden name (Bloomer) and his daughter&#x27;s married name (Merrifield). The post office adopted this name the next year, but, according to the state&#x27;s Land Office, the town was still formally incorporated under the name Middlesburg in 1819.

Bloomfield&#x27;s economy has always been agriculturally based, but there was a flour mill and a tobacco auction house in the 19th century. The Newell B. McClaskey House and plantation was built in 1835, and is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The McClaskey family had owned over 700 acres of land in the area at one time.

The public library was established in 1916 by the local Woman&#x27;s Club.

<text>Hartford is a home rule-class city in Ohio County, Kentucky, in the United States. It is the seat of its county. The population was 2,668 at the 2020 census. The town slogan, &quot;Home of 2,000 happy people and a few soreheads&quot;, welcomes visitors when they enter the community. The Hartford, Kentucky website explains that &quot;soreheads are community-minded, progressive citizens who work to promote civic pride&quot;.

==History==
The town was initially part of a 4000-acre grant from Virginia to Gabriel Madison. The area was surveyed in 1782 and settled before 1790. Fort Hartford (also known as Hartford Station) grew up around the head of navigation on the Rough River, which the bridge crossing that river is called the Fort Hartford Bridge. About the town, It initially faced Indian attacks but was named the seat of Ohio County the year after its formation in 1798 in exchange for a grant of land from Mr. Madison. The post office was established as Hartford Court House in 1801 and the settlement was formally incorporated by the state assembly in 1808.

An account written in the early 1800s by a William Smithers relates that he and several other settlers helped build &quot;a fort at Hartford on Rough Creek&quot; in 1782–83, which local tradition asserts was the first permanent settlement in Ohio County and the entire lower Green River Valley. It is believed to have consisted of a stockade and small log buildings on the bluff above the Rough River now occupied by Hartford&#x27;s water plant. Although many believe the town&#x27;s name refers to a ford on the Rough River (a large tributary of the Green River then known as Rough Creek), and an early settler who operated a ferry there, the name&#x27;s origin remains uncertain.

The town&#x27;s second courthouse was burned during the Civil War by Confederate Gen. Hylan B. Lyon on December 20, 1864.

The town was finally connected to the L&amp;N network in 1909.

=== Downtown Historic District of Hartford ===
The Downtown Hartford Historic District consists of 18 locations occupying the courthouse square, approximately two blocks on Main St. and E. Union St. north of the square, and three properties immediately south and east of the courthouse. All except one location, a circa 1870 brick house, are commercial and institutional buildings representing three architecturally distinct periods: the late nineteenth to early twentieth century, 1920 to 1930, and the late 1930s to early 1940s. The earliest group of commercial buildings includes the district&#x27;s only two constructed of wood; in addition, four are of masonry construction, including two with cast iron fronts. Among the five buildings representing the decade ending in 1930, one dates to the late nineteenth century but had its main façade reconstructed in the 1920s. From the late Depression years, two buildings were private endeavors and three were the result of a federally sponsored public works program. Most of the buildings are two stories tall, although a few are a single story and the courthouse is two stories on a full raised basement.

Several elements of the Downtown Hartford Historic District, including the courthouse, jail and main block of the Hartford City Hall, remain virtually intact on the exterior. As in most downtowns, however, storefronts have suffered the greatest changes. Fortunately, most of the upper elevations of these buildings have been well preserved so that the district&#x27;s streetscape retains its historic character. Despite alterations, the district remains a visually distinct entity due to the extensively renovated older buildings and new construction that define its edges.

<text>Buckner is a census-designated place (CDP) in Oldham County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 5,837 at the 2020 census.

Oldham County High School is located in Buckner. The town and the school were hit by an EF2 tornado on April 2, 2024.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which is land and (2.00%) is water.

== History ==

=== Founding and Early History ===
Buckner&#x27;s history began in the early 1800s when settlers arrived through Old Brownsboro Road and established a settlement that was named &quot;La Fayetteville.&quot; In 1820 early settler William P. Rodman sold 120 acres to Mitchell Overstreet, who opened a general store and a small village. By 1826, La Fayetteville had a blacksmith, general store, tavern, church, and sawmill. The town campaigned to be the county seat but lost to La Grange. By 1880, &quot;Buckner Station,&quot; named for the Buckner family, was shortened to &quot;Buckner.&quot; In 1874, it was populated by 250 residents with a steam sawmill, two distilleries, two churches, and a seminary. John George Klein, an immigrant from Germany, opened the first commercial winery in Oldham County at Buckner in 1886. 

The Louisville &amp; Eastern Electric Railroad was brought to Oldham County in the early 1900s, from Crestwood to Buckner and on to La Grange by 1906. The line was a commuter railroad featuring livestock cars and baggage cars transporting milk and cream. A court battle and final agreement over land rights in Buckner with the L&amp;N Railroad allowed the extension of the Electric Railroad. Education also changed with Buckner, as there was an early school on the west side of Cedar Point Road, then a two-story brick school built at the site of the present Oldham County High School.

Buckner resident J.T. Clifton remembers his boyhood when the interurban streetcar from Louisville to La Grange would make frequent stops. His family operated a dairy near what is now the industrial park at KY 146 and I-71. Clifton saw a number of changes, including the replacement of oil lamps by carbide lights and the paving of KY 146 in 1929. At one time Buckner boasted three general stores and one of the county&#x27;s oldest post offices, run by Sam Leet. The Clifton place, with a house built sometime between 1875 and 1900, featured an old wine cellar converted to use as a smokehouse. Clifton also remembers “hobos” stopping for food and milk and adventures driving to Louisville for oysters and entertainment. Lumber from the L&amp;N depot was repurposed for a house still standing on KY 146 in La Grange.

=== Modern History ===
Shaw&#x27;s Grocery, a small, family-run general store, was a pillar of the neighborhood for many years. In addition to offering groceries and other necessities for the home in a welcoming, individualized environment, it functioned as a hub for residents. Shaw&#x27;s Grocery closed despite its success as bigger chain stores appeared nearby, indicating shifts in the local economy. Although the store&#x27;s closure signaled the end of an era, many longtime Buckner residents still have pleasant memories of it.

Another existing business in Buckner, Torbitt &amp; Castleman, maker of syrups and barbecue sauce, has again expanded its facilities with a new 17,000 square foot building that will bring in six new jobs as most of the work will be done by automation.

Of course, Buckner is also home to such manufacturers and business concerns as U.S. Housing Components, the Rigo Co., Catalyst Technology, East &amp; Westbrook and a number of smaller businesses.

Buckner has two industrial parks: one owned by Torbitt &amp; Castleman, and the other across the railroad tracks, closer to Interstate 71.

One of Buckner&#x27;s biggest claims to fame is the John Black Community Center, Aquatic Center, and the Lost World Playground. The playground, designed by children in Oldham County, was built in 2003 by volunteers from the community to help give kids in the area a new space to play.

In 2022, the Oldham County Aquatic Center pool closed for a massive renovation. It reopened on Memorial Day weekend 2024.

On November 1st, 2024, a new 100,000-square-foot Kroger grocery store opened in Buckner, just off of I-71 on Highway 393. The $35 million facility features a drive-thru pharmacy, Little Clinic, Starbucks, and a fuel center. The centerpiece inside is an 8&#x27; tall community mural by Louisville artist Amie Villiger Harris honoring Yew Dell Gardens, Kentucky&#x27;s state bird-the Cardinal-and state flower-the Goldenrod. This is the first Kroger to open in Buckner; the nearest one to date has been in La Grange.

<text>Gratz is a home rule-class city in Owen County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 89 at the 2000 census. The population in 2010 was 78.

==History==
The present city was laid out in 1847 on land supposedly owned by the heirs of Sen. John Brown and was probably named for his grandson B. Gratz Brown, who later became a senator from and governor of Missouri and made a failed vice-presidential bid in 1872 with Horace Greeley of the Liberal Republicans.

The town was incorporated in either 1861 or 1881.

Before the lock and dam system was built on the Kentucky River, Gratz was one of the most prosperous towns in the area due to the business of portaging goods around an unnavigable part of the river (Lock #2 is just up river at Lockport). Goods were also ferried across the river and transported up KY 22 to Pleasureville, which had a railroad depot.

The town&#x27;s streets are laid out in a grid pattern. There is a local bank, and many large, well-built houses. Before public electric service was available, a diesel powered generator fed streetlights from dusk until about 10 p.m. A former operator of this plant reported that he learned how much fuel to put into the engine so that it would run out at the desired time (saved him a trip down the hill).

It is home to the only bridge between Owen and Henry county across the Kentucky River. The old Gratz Bridge was a historic iron steel bridge built back in 1931. Work on a newer concrete bridge was finished in 2011. The Gratz Bridge was demolished in February of that year. The Gratz Bridge was on the National Register of historic landmarks. A piece of the old bridge was used in a commemorative kiosk at the site of the old Gratz entrance to the bridge.

===Post office and female postmasters===
A local post office was established on November 21, 1844, as &quot;Clay Lick&quot; due to its position above the Clay Lick Creek and Joseph W. Rowlett served as the first Postmaster up until July 20, 1850.

The post office was renamed &quot;Gratz&quot; in February 1851 after the town was named for Benjamin Gratz Brown, grandson of John Brown.

70 years after the post office first opened its doors, history was made for the tiny village, as Ida M. Johnson became the first woman postmaster for the Gratz branch, holding the position for 10 years from April 2, 1914, until April 2, 1924.

Another legacy for the branch would begin in 1927 and continue through 1990 with Martha B. Suter serving as Gratz postmaster for a record 33 consecutive years from May 24, 1927 (just 3 years after Ida Johnson) until September 30, 1960, whereafter Suter was succeeded by another woman, Charlsey Virginia Stamper Goodrich. Goodrich served as Gratz postmaster for 23 years from September 30, 1960, up until her early retirement (due to illness) on April 2, 1983. It was then that another woman, Teresa A. Webster, succeeded Goodrich as Gratz postmaster from April 2, 1983, until February 6, 1990, when service was suspended after 146 years of operation. That made 63 consecutive years (1927–1990) in which the Gratz postmaster position was led by a woman and for that era, it was certainly an achievement to be very proud for the Gratz community.

Accounting for the 10 years Ida M. Johnson served as postmaster, with just a three-year gap between her and Martha B. Suter, the Gratz post office was led by a woman for 73 of its 146 years of operation. There was a one-month period in which another woman served as the Acting Postmaster for Gratz during Ms. Suter&#x27;s tenure, perhaps due to a short leave of absence for Suter and, that &quot;acting&quot; role was held by Roberta G Minish from December 21, 1927, until January 18, 1928, when Ms. Suter returned to her position as Postmaster.

In total, there were 5 women who served as Gratz Postmaster: Ida M. Johnson, Martha B. Suter (with Roberta G. Minish as &#x27;Acting&#x27; temporarily), Charlsey Stamper Goodrich and Teresa A. Webster.

Upon its suspension of service in February 1990, all mail service was acquired by the Owenton city post office.

<text>Booneville is a home rule-class city in Owsley County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 168 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Owsley County. It is located at the junction of Kentucky Route 11 and Kentucky Route 30 on the South Fork of the Kentucky River.

==History==
The town was originally named Moore&#x27;s Station after its chief landowner. It was renamed Boone&#x27;s Station and then Booneville in honor of the American frontiersman, Daniel Boone. The town, consisting at the time of little more than a temporary log courthouse, became the county seat when Owsley County was formed on May 20, 1844. From this, the settlement was also sometimes known as Owsley Court House around this time. It was formally incorporated as a city by the state assembly on March 1, 1847. During the Civil War, Booneville was a crossroads for various Union and Confederate regiments, and was threatened by Confederate guerrillas, but avoided the destruction that befell some other county seats of Kentucky during the war.

The Moyers Building in Boonesville was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

<doc id="115400" wikidata="Q2627136" url="?curid=115400" title="Falmouth, Kentucky">
<text>Falmouth is a home rule-class city in, and the county seat of, Pendleton County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 2,169 according to the 2010 census. It lies at the confluence of the South and Main forks of the Licking River and is home to Kincaid Regional Theatre.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==History==
Possibly settled as early as 1780, Falmouth was laid out by John Waller (1758–1823) and formally established by the state assembly in 1793. Waller named the new settlement after his native Falmouth, Virginia. It was incorporated as a city in 1856.

The town is perhaps best remembered for natural disasters that have devastated the town over the last half of the 20th century. In 1964, the Licking River reached 47 feet (19 feet above flood stage) and left much of the town under water. On April 23, 1968 an F4 (possibly F5) tornado leveled many homes in the town, killing four people. On March 2, 1997, a major flood on the Licking River again left the town crippled. The river reached 52 feet (24 feet above flood stage) and left 80% of the town under several feet of water. Many homes and businesses were damaged and five residents were killed.

Charity&#x27;s House and Elzey Hughes House were both part of the historically African-American &quot;Happy Hollow&quot; neighborhood and each is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Arts and culture==

Kincaid Regional Theatre, also referred to as KRT, has called Falmouth home since 1983. Since the theatre&#x27;s founding, KRT has achieved musical theatre excellence by employing local talent from the Cincinnati metropolitan area and beyond. With the help of many supporters, KRT continues to enhance the arts in the community with children and teens theatre workshops and through involvement with local schools. Originally operated at the former Falmouth High School. Other venues have included the Griffin Centre Amphitheatre. KRT now performs at Stonewood Gardens, also in Falmouth.

Falmouth plays host to one of Kentucky&#x27;s largest fall events, the Kentucky Wool Festival. The Wool Festival is an annual event held adjacent to Kincaid Lake State Park during the first full weekend of October. The festival promotes wool products, crafts, food, among other products. The festival provides fundraising activities to local organizations and entertainment for all age groups. Heritage demonstrations and livestock exhibitions also highlight Pendleton County and Kentucky history. The Kentucky Wool Festival has inspired the local community to adopt the sheep as its unofficial mascot.

<text>Hazard is a home rule-class city in, and the county seat of, Perry County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 5,263 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Local landowner Elijah Combs Sr. laid out the town in 1824 as the planned seat of the newly established Perry County. Both the town and the county were named for Cdre. Oliver Hazard Perry, a commander in the 1813 Battle of Lake Erie in the War of 1812. The post office was initially known as Perry Court House but the name was officially changed to Hazard in 1854. The city was formally incorporated by the state assembly in 1884.

Long isolated by the surrounding mountains, Hazard was opened to the outside world by the arrival of the railroad in 1912. The only access to the valley had previously been 45 miles down the North Fork of the Kentucky River or a two-week trip over the surrounding mountains. The railroad brought prosperity to the town, which ended up on the start of the Great Depression.

The song &quot;High Sheriff of Hazard&quot; was written by Tom Paxton in reference to a coal miner&#x27;s strike in 1964.

In 1981, several cast members of the television series &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;, including Catherine Bach, James Best, Sorrell Booke and Rick Hurst, visited Hazard during its Black Gold Festival. Soon afterwards, the series&#x27; stars Tom Wopat and John Schneider made appearances in Hazard.

After several decades of population decline, the city has seen a rapid increase of new residents as the growth rate approached 20% between 2010 and 2020. In July 1999, Hazard was the first stop on President Bill Clinton&#x27;s tour of poverty-stricken communities that had failed to share in the boom of the 1990s. Hillary Clinton visited Hazard on November 2, 2008, at a political rally for Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Bruce Lunsford.

One of the two ZIP codes serving Hazard is 41702; as of 2024, there are precisely 41,702 ZIP codes in the United States.
==Geography==

Hazard is located at (37.255910, −83.193706).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==Climate==
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Hazard has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Vicco is an inactive city in Perry and Knott counties, Kentucky, United States as defined by Kentucky Act Acts Ch. 25. The population was 334 at the 2010 census.

On January 16, 2013, Vicco became the smallest city in the United States to pass an ordinance outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation.

==History==
Vicco was originally a coal mining town; its name comes from the initials of the Virginia Iron Coal and Coke Company. The city was known for its bars and entertainment; &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;the local coal miner&#x27;s Vegas&quot;. The decline of the coal industry in the region brought economic trouble to Vicco, as local businesses closed and the city faced severe budget deficits. However, in the early 2010s, the city attempted a revival, restarting its defunct police force among other measures.

===Pending Dissolution===

On March 24, 2022, Governor Andy Beshear signed Senate Bill 106 to simplify the processes of dissolving a defunct city and cut local taxes. In the Commonwealth of Kentucky, cities are classified as defunct when it collects taxes from people who live there, but do not have the elected officers to spend the revenue.

Perry County Judge-Executive Scott Alexander classified Vicco as defunct in 2020. Alexander stated, &quot;The residents of Vicco, they&#x27;re still being charged a tax on their insurance,&quot; he said. &quot;But, that money is just sitting in a pot and can&#x27;t be spent by anyone, and therefore we&#x27;re looking at dissolving Vicco to help those residents so they will no longer have to pay those taxes&quot;.

Senate Bill 106 gives Vicco and other defunct cities until January 1, 2023, to satisfy requirements to avoid dissolution. As of November 14, 2022 no action by the city had been taken and Perry County assumed most responsibilities of the defunct city., Senate Bill 106 however makes the process automated.

<text>Elkhorn City is a home rule-class city in Pike County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 1,035 at the 2020 census. The city is located in proximity to the Breaks Interstate Park.

==History==
Elkhorn City was first settled by William Ramey of North Carolina . However, in 1767–1768, Daniel Boone took his first steps in what is now Kentucky near present-day Elkhorn City on a hunting expedition.

It was originally named &quot;Elkhorn&quot;, after an elk&#x27;s horn that was found on the banks of the nearby creek (also named Elkhorn.) Because there was already a town named &quot;Elk Horn&quot; in Taylor County, the town had to be renamed in order to avoid confusion. On October 16, 1882, the post office was renamed &quot;Praise&quot; for &quot;Camp Praise-the-Lord&quot;, a tent colony that was established by evangelist George O. Barnes for a revival there in August 1881. In 1907, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway established a station in Praise that was named &quot;Elkhorn City&quot;. Although Elkhorn City was incorporated as a city on November 4, 1912, the local post office was not renamed Elkhorn City until September 1, 1952, after local pressure for a uniform name.

The neighboring settlement of Cedarville merged with Elkhorn City in 2009.

<text>Pikeville () is a home rule-class city in and the county seat of Pike County, Kentucky, United States. Its population was 7,754 as of the 2020 U.S. Census. Pikeville serves as a regional economic, educational, and entertainment hub for the surrounding areas of eastern Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia. It is home to the University of Pikeville and the Pikeville Cut-Through, the second-largest earthmoving project in the Western Hemisphere.

==History==

On March 25, 1822, state officials decided to build a new county seat named &quot;Liberty&quot;, below the mouth of the Russell Fork. Public disapproval of the site led a new decision on December 24, 1823, to establish the county seat on land donated by local farmer Elijah Adkins. This settlement was established as the town of Pike in 1824. This was changed in 1829 to Piketon and the town was incorporated under that name in 1848. In 1850, this was changed to Pikeville. Pikeville was host to part of the Hatfield-McCoy feud, and patriarch Randall McCoy as well as his wife and daughter are buried on a hillside overlooking the town.

The National Civic League designated Pikeville as an All-American City in 1965.

From 1973 to 1987, the Pikeville Cut-Through was constructed immediately west of downtown. The massive rock cut is one of the largest civil engineering projects in the western hemisphere, moving nearly of soil and rock. The project alleviated traffic congestion in downtown and eliminated flooding by rerouting the Levisa Fork River.

From 1982 to 1984, Pikeville was home to the Pikeville Cubs and Pikeville Brewers. Pikeville played as a member of the Rookie level Appalachian League. Pikeville was an affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers (1982) and Chicago Cubs (1983–84). Baseball Hall of Fame member Greg Maddux played for the 1984 Pikeville Cubs in his first professional season.

The city has been a center of rapid development in Eastern Kentucky since the 1990s. Pikeville College (now the University of Pikeville) opened the Kentucky College of Osteopathic Medicine in 1997. The university also opened the Kentucky College of Optometry, Central Appalachia&#x27;s first optometry school, in 2016. In 2005, the 7,000 seat, multi-purpose Appalachian Wireless Arena opened in downtown. Pikeville Medical Center has established itself as a regional healthcare center. In 2014, a new 11-story clinic and a 10-story parking structure was completed at a cost of $150 million. The hospital has also become a member of the Mayo Clinic Care Network. In 2013, construction began on a shopping center known as Pikeville Commons. The first stores opened in the shopping center in 2014.

Late 2017 saw several announcements regarding tenants for the recently opened Kentucky Enterprise Industrial Park. Construction has begun on a 60,000 square foot manufacturing facility to be owned and operated by SilverLiner, whose primary business is expected to be the manufacture and assembly of tanks for tanker trucks.

In 2018, the Kentucky League of Cities named Pikeville&#x27;s city government the KLC City Government of the Year. This was the award&#x27;s inaugural year; it was intended to recognize &quot;a city that has done something transformational, and our first ever recipient certainly demonstrates a city making a huge impact on its region.&quot;

==Geography==

The city is in the Appalachian Mountains, along the Levisa Fork of the Big Sandy River. The downtown area is built in a narrow valley in a bend of the Levisa Fork that was bypassed in 1987 with the completion of the Pikeville Cut-Through, while places such as Weddington Square Plaza are built in a broader part of the river valley.

<text>Burnside is a home rule-class city in Pulaski County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 611 at the 2010 census. In 2004, Burnside became the only town in Pulaski County or any adjoining county to allow the sale of alcoholic beverages in qualified establishments. Since then, Burnside has annexed about eight miles of shoreline along Lake Cumberland in order to include Lee&#x27;s Ford Marina on Fishing Creek, allowing it to sell alcohol.

On August 28, 2007, Burnside voters again approved the sale of alcoholic beverages in restaurants that seat at least 100 people and derive at least 70% of their gross receipts from the sale of food, by a vote of 227–104. The petition for the election was started by two Pulaski County clergymen in an attempt to reverse Burnside&#x27;s &quot;moist&quot; status.

On October 15, 2013, the City of Burnside voted to go fully &quot;wet&quot; by a count of 123–39.

==History==
The community was originally settled at the juncture of the Cumberland River and its South Fork. It was called Point Isabel, allegedly for a woman who jumped off a nearby cliff after breaking off a relationship. In 1890, the town was renamed for Civil War General Ambrose Burnside, who established a camp there during the war.

Burnside was a center for shipping by rail and steamboat packet. Its lumber mills sent products around the world. The town boasted retail stores, saloons, a post office, restaurants, churches, a bank, hotels, and even Burnside Academy the first Wesleyan preparatory school in the state.

In the early 1950s, the entire town was relocated to higher ground due to the impounding of Lake Cumberland. The town had once been a thriving community. American author Harriette Simpson Arnow who was known for her book &quot;The Dollmaker&quot; lived in Burnside as a child.

Burnside is one of several places that lay claim to be home to the first Boy Scout troop in the United States. In 1908, two years before the Boy Scouts of America was officially organized, Mrs. Myra Greeno Bass organized a local troop of 15 boys, using official Boy Scout materials she had acquired from England. A sign at the edge of town declares Burnside &quot;Birthplace of Boy Scouts in America&quot;, and an official state historical society marker commemorates the troop.

<text>Ferguson is a home rule-class city just south of downtown Somerset in Pulaski County, Kentucky, United States. It had a population of 924 as of the 2010 census, up from 881 in 2000.

==History==
The city was originally constructed just north of the Cincinnati Southern Railroad&#x27;s engine repair shops as a residential community for its workers. It was incorporated by the state assembly in 1906. It was likely named for the Cincinnati attorney Edward A. Ferguson who helped found the railroad in 1869.

Because another community in Logan County already possessed a post office named Ferguson, the city long employed the name Luretha for mail delivery after the daughter of its first postmaster George Wynn. In 1950, the Logan Co. post office was closed and the Board on Geographic Names approved the use of Ferguson for the Pulaski community&#x27;s mail.

The railroad shops were specialized for work with steam engines and were shuttered after trains began using diesel locomotives in the mid-20th century.

===Ferguson School===
Ferguson School opened in 1910 for grades 1–12 to serve the children of the town and the rural area just south and east. The high school fluctuated in enrollment from 100 to 150. The high school closed in 1968 and the elementary school in 1978. The property of the former school grounds is now the Ferguson Park, and the buildings house community center offices and recreational facilities. Ferguson students now attend Southwestern-Pulaski County High School.

==Geography==

<doc id="115414" wikidata="Q2303714" url="?curid=115414" title="Somerset, Kentucky">
<text>Somerset is a home rule-class city in Pulaski County, Kentucky, United States. The city population was 11,924 according to the 2020 census. It is the seat of Pulaski County.

==History==
Somerset was first settled in 1798 by Thomas Hansford and received its name from Somerset County, New Jersey, where some of the early settlers had formerly lived. Somerset became the Pulaski County seat in 1801, and was incorporated as a city in 1887. A Civil War battle was fought in January 1862 at Mill Springs (now &quot;Nancy&quot;) about west of Somerset, and a museum is at the site. A smaller battle was fought nearby at Dutton&#x27;s Hill in 1863. In 1875 tracks for the Southern Railway were completed and Somerset saw a population growth and an increase in industry. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, library services were provided by the pack horse library. The completion of Lake Cumberland in 1950 transformed Somerset from a sleepy rural community into a recreation center.

The Center for Rural Development in Somerset was established in 1996. It is a 501c(3) nonprofit organization that describes its mission as follows: &quot;to provide leadership that stimulates innovative and sustainable economic development solutions and a better way of life for the citizens we serve.&quot; The center&#x27;s programs and services focus on public safety, arts &amp; culture, leadership, and technology.

==Geography==
The city is located at the eastern end of Kentucky&#x27;s Mississippian Plateau (or Pennyroyal Plateau); however, the micropolitan area extends eastward into the Appalachian Plateau (or Eastern Kentucky Coalfield), and northward to Kentucky&#x27;s Outer Bluegrass region. Thus, the area shows variations in landforms and scenery.

Nearby Lake Cumberland is one of the largest man-made lakes in the world (101 miles in length, with an average depth of and a normal pool containing more than 2 trillion gallons of water). Somerset is also near Cumberland Falls and the Big South Fork National River and Recreation Area; its tourism industries are, in part, due to its scenic and varied landscape.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which 0.09% is covered by water.

===Climate===

The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen climate classification, Somerset has a humid subtropical climate, &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

Somerset&#x27;s climate is warm during summer when temperatures tend to be in the 80s and mild during winter when temperatures tend to be in the 30s and 40s. The warmest month of the year is July with an average daily maximum temperature of . The coldest month of the year is January with an average minimum temperature of .

The annual average precipitation at Somerset is . Rainfall is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year. The wettest month of the year is July with an average rainfall of . Snowfall typically occurs between the months of December and February, though on record as early as October and as late as May.

==Demographics==
The major demographic differences between the city and the micropolitan area relate to income, housing composition, and age. The micropolitan area, as compared to the incorporated city, is more suburban in flavor and has a younger housing stock and a higher income, and contains most of the area&#x27;s school-age population. Over the last 20 years, housing growth has occurred along the Fishing Creek tributary of Lake Cumberland, which lies just to the west of the City of Somerset, and along the main body of Lake Cumberland between the City of Burnside and Fishing Creek. Much of the Somerset area housing growth in the last 20 years is lake oriented.

As of the census of 2000, 11,352 people, 4,831 households, and 2,845 families resided in the City of Somerset. The population density for the city was . A karst valley occupies the south-central portion of the city, taking up about 25% of the land area; this valley is quasi-industrialized and also contains parks and recreational facilities; most of the population lives to the east and north of this valley in fairly compact residential neighborhoods that have a real population density of about 1,800 persons per square mile. The 5,428 housing units had an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 94.16% White, 3.66% Black, 0.18% Native American, 0.71% Asian, 0.26% from other races, and 1.02% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 0.99% of the population.

Of the 4,831 households, 26.6% had children under 18 living with them, 41.3% were married couples living together, 15.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 41.1% were not families. About 37.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 18.4% had someone living alone who was 65 or older. The average household size was 2.13 and the average family size was 2.80.

In the city, the age distribution was 20.6% under 18, 8.5% from 18 to 24, 27.8% from 25 to 44, 21.7% from 45 to 64, and 21.4% 65 or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 82.5 males. For every 100 females 18 and over, there were 78.5 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $22,362, and for a family was $31,226. Males had a median income of $28,536 versus $20,194 for females. The per capita income for the city was $14,048. About 16.4% of families and 22.1% of the population were below the poverty line, including 31.3% of those under 18 and 18.9% of those 65 or over.

==Economy==
Tourism is important to Somerset, due to its proximity to Lake Cumberland, which generated about $150 million in revenue each year as of 2013, though the industry has been greatly impacted in recent years by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers&#x27; work on the Wolf Creek Dam. Since 2007, Lake Cumberland has been at low levels to facilitate the Corps work. The city holds the annual Master Musicians Festival. The Civil War Battle of Mill Springs took place in nearby Nancy. In November 2006, the Mill Springs Battlefield Visitor Center and Museum opened. Begun in 2001, Somernites Cruise is a monthly classic car show held the fourth weekend of the months April through October.

In 2006, a new medical park, called MedPark West, was finished near the Lake Cumberland Regional Hospital (LCRH). LCRH is one of the largest in the state. LCRH is a JCAHO-accredited hospital with 304 beds. A virtual online tour of the hospital is available. A ventilator care facility, Rockcastle Regional Hospital and Respiratory Care Center, is in adjoining Rockcastle County.

On June 26, 2012, Somerset city voters approved the sale of alcoholic beverages by a margin of 2,167 &quot;Wet&quot; votes to 1,464 &quot;Dry&quot; votes. This vote allows for packaged liquor and beer sales, and sales by the drink at restaurants and bars.

In 2014, a municipal-run filling station, the Somerset Fuel Center, was opened in response to persistently high local gas prices. &quot;The price of gas will be based on an average regional price and will include a small markup to cover costs, the mayor said.&quot; In addition to serving local residents, it was hoped the station would encourage visits to nearby Lake Cumberland for fishing and boating.

Nearby Somerset, located off Highway 461, is the Valley Oak Technology Complex, an industrial center. Housed there are such companies as SafeAuto.

==Employers==
Major employers in the Somerset area include:

*Blackboard

Students living within the city limits typically fall under the Somerset Independent School District. The Pulaski County School System contains Pulaski County High School and Southwestern High School, which was built in 1993 to alleviate overcrowding.

Other smaller schools include Tabernacle Christian Academy, Science Hill Independent, Somerset Christian School, and Saline Christian Academy. The three main high schools are Southwestern, Pulaski County, and Somerset. The local two-year college, Somerset Community College, is part of the Kentucky Community and Technical College System.

==History==

The area was first settled by European Americans in 1790 after the American Revolutionary War, around a feature called Spout Springs. Much of the area was originally swampland. The settlement was named for George Washington&#x27;s home, Mount Vernon. The Wilderness Road was constructed to this town in 1792, and this was the principal settlement when Rockcastle Co. was created in 1810.

In 1883, an L&amp;N spur was built through the town, connecting it by rail to Louisville and Knoxville. The county&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Mount Vernon Signal&quot;, began publication in 1887. Although it was still a largely rural town and county in the late 20th century, the construction of I-75 in the 1970s has drawn some industry to the area. The population has increased about 50% from 1,639 in 1970.

<doc id="115420" wikidata="Q1904491" url="?curid=115420" title="Morehead, Kentucky">
<text>Morehead is a home rule-class city located along US 60 (the historic Midland Trail) and Interstate 64 in Rowan County, Kentucky, in the United States. It is the seat of its county. The population was 7,151 at the time of the 2020 U.S. census.

It was the focal point of the Rowan County War and is the home of Morehead State University.

==History==
===Initial settlement===

The first European settlers came to Rowan County from Virginia following the end of the American Revolutionary War in 1783. In 1854, Morehead became the third community to be settled in the county. Colonel John Hargis founded the city after purchasing land in the area. The city was named after James T Morehead, a politician who served as governor of Kentucky from 1834 to 1836. Rowan County came into existence in May 1856, seceding from parts of Morgan County and Fleming County. It was divided into four districts with Morehead being declared the county seat. The formation of Rowan County was a political ploy to prevent Flemingsburg from moving its seat to Poplar Plains, and Morehead was selected as Rowan&#x27;s seat because of its centrality. Although it was smaller and less developed than the neighboring town of Farmers, it remained a significant city in the county due its status as county seat. It was officially incorporated in 1869.

===Rowan County War===
In the 1880s, Morehead became the central stage for a notorious conflict known as the Rowan County War or the Martin–Tolliver–Logan Feud. During a number of skirmishes for the next few years, at least 20 people were killed and possibly 100 were wounded. Beginning with an election-day barroom brawl, several gunfights took place in Morehead and the surrounding countryside. Eventually, a group led by Craig Tolliver seized political control of the town and installed allies in the county sheriff&#x27;s and county attorney&#x27;s offices as well as at the office of the town marshal. Several members of the opposing faction were arrested on trumped-up charges, and some were killed when the faction in power falsely claimed they had resisted arrest. The conflict gained national attention and on two occasions the governor sent troops to maintain order with little effect. Eventually a posse of as many as 100 individuals were organized and armed by Daniel Boone Logan with the tacit consent of Gov. J. Proctor Knott and Governor-elect Simon Buckner. In a dramatic two-hour gun battle through the center of Morehead, several Tollivers (including Craig) were killed and the Tollivers&#x27; control of the county was broken. Two men were later acquitted for the murder of Craig Tolliver. Morehead State University was established as an indirect result of the feud. After the state militia came to settle the feud, the Disciples of Christ established a church and school which served as the forerunner to the university.

===20th century===

The industry improved in the early 20th century. It was considered an important shipping center in the region, and the city of Chesapeake, Ohio even carried out developments on the road system of Morehead. Its abundance of lumber, fire clay, farm products and gas made it an active center of industry, of which was mainly oriented towards agriculture. The close proximity of the Licking River helped ensure the population would flourish. In the 1920s, the city refocused its efforts towards fire clay extraction amidst the dwindling prices of timber. One of the first transcontinental auto trails in the US, the Midland Trail, was connected to Morehead in 1929.

In July 1939, a number of business and hotels located on Mainstreet were caught in a raging fire following Independence Day celebrations which went awry. The town&#x27;s pack horse library center was burned down as well. Only 24 hours afterwards, the town was badly affected by flash flooding. At least 25 people died, and thousands had to receive vaccinations for Typhoid fever. The property costs incurred by the flooding were estimated at $1,000,000, while the damage inflicted on crops and farms caused an economic loss of about $500,000.
In the early 1960s, efforts were underway to establish a local hospital. An agreement was eventually reached with the Sisters of Notre Dame in Covington, Kentucky in which the sisters would assume responsibility for operating the proposed hospital. In July 1963, St Claire&#x27;s Medical Center was opened with a 41-bed capacity. Transport in and out of the city was greatly improved in 1969 after the completion of Interstate 64 to the north.

After the logging and extraction industries lost momentum in eastern Kentucky during the mid-1900s, the city invested heavily in developing Morehead State University as a means to secure economic growth. Morehead also sought to capitalize on tourism by ameliorating its natural attractions. Hiking trails were created through Cave Run Lake in the 1960s and 1970s, and in 1974, tourism was further boosted when Cave Run Lake was impounded by the city. By 1990, Morehead State University had become the largest employer in the city.

===21st century===
In 2015, Kim Davis of Morehead gained international attention after she defied a federal court order requiring that as Clerk of Rowan County she issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple.

The Downtown Morehead Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2022.

==Religion==
