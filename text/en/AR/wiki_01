<doc id="115152" wikidata="Q3179837" url="?curid=115152" title="Bonnieville, Kentucky">
<text>Bonnieville is an unincorporated community in Hart County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 269 at the 2020 census. It was a home rule-class city from 1955 to 2024, when residents voted to dissolve Bonnieville into Hart County.

==History==
Founded in 1849, the town was originally known as Bacon Creek, for the stream that runs through the city. It is rumored that the name was changed to Bonnieville because of the popularity of the song &quot;My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean&quot;.

On December 26, 1862, the Confederate John Hunt Morgan sent a detachment from Upton to the bridge over Bacon Creek in Bonnieville. A brief firefight with a detachment of the 2nd Michigan Volunteer Cavalry Regiment resulted with the destruction of the bridge for a third time and the wounding of 23. The railroad remained closed for six weeks until the tracks could be repaired and reopened on February 1.

Bonnieville was incorporated as its own city in 1955, when it was full of tourists who were using U.S. Route 31W to reach Louisville and Nashville. Businesses included restaurants, gas stations, a barbershop, a roller rink, and Bonn Theater. Most of the city&#x27;s businesses closed after Interstate 65 was finished in the 1970s, which enabled travelers to reach Louisville and Nashville without going through Bonnieville.

On November 5, 2024, in an effort spearheaded by Melody Shanaberger, residents voted 67-60 to dissolve Bonnieville into Hart County, effective December 8. Shanaberger, who moved to the town from a nearby goat farm in 2021, said her tax dollars (she paid about $30 a year in taxes) weren&#x27;t leading to concrete improvements in the town. 

==Geography==
Bonnieville is located at .

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. U.S. Route 31W passes through the middle of Bonnieville, with most of the city concentrated around this highway&#x27;s two intersections with Kentucky Route 728. Bonnieville is accessible from Exit 71 on Interstate 65. Part of the original main line of the historic Louisville and Nashville Railroad (now CSX) passes through the city. Bacon Creek, a tributary of the Nolin River, bisects the city.

<text>Henderson is a home rule-class city along the Ohio River and the county seat of Henderson County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 29,781 at the 2020 U.S. census. It is part of the Evansville–Henderson, IN–KY Combined Statistical Area, locally known as the &quot;Tri-State Area,&quot; and is considered the southernmost suburb of Evansville, Indiana.

==History==
===Early settlements===

Archaeological research shows that people were living in what is now Kentucky by at least 9,500 BCE, although they may have arrived much earlier.

The settlers of the area after the start of the 1st millennium CE were of the Mississippian culture, a Native American civilization that flourished throughout what is now the Midwestern, Eastern, and Southeastern United States, from approximately 800 CE to 1600 CE. The population of most settlements of this culture had dispersed or were experiencing severe social and environmental stress by 1500.

The area that is now Henderson County was later inhabited by the Yuchi, Shawnee and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians. Significant artifacts from these tribes and earlier peoples, including from mounds, have been found by white settlers and their descendants since the 1700s.

===18th century===
Henderson has its roots in a small, block-wide strip of land high above the Ohio River, the site of the present-day Audubon Mill Park directly south of the city&#x27;s riverfront boat dock. A village on this site was called &quot;Red Banks&quot; because of the reddish clay soil of the bluffs overlooking the Ohio River. The future city was named after Richard Henderson, an eighteenth-century pioneer and land speculator, by his associates Samuel Hopkins and Thomas Allin. Henderson County also shares this namesake. On March 17, 1775, North Carolina judge Richard Henderson and his Transylvania Company had met with 1,200 Cherokee in a council at Sycamore Shoals (present-day Elizabethton, Tennessee) to purchase over of land between the Ohio, Cumberland, and Kentucky rivers in present-day Kentucky and Tennessee to resell it to white settlers. Known as the Transylvania Purchase, the sale was voided by the Virginia General Assembly, since the territory (and the sole right to purchase land from Indians within its bounds) was part of Virginia&#x27;s royal charter. However, the commonwealth granted Henderson and his company an area of to develop. It was located at the confluence of the Green and Ohio rivers. Henderson hired Daniel Boone to survey the country and select favorable sites, but Henderson died before the town was developed.

By the early 1790s, Red Banks had a tavern and several European-American families co-existing with the local Cherokee. On November 16, 1792, resident Robert Simpson wrote to Alexander D. Orr in Lexington, requesting help to appoint a magistrate for Red Banks to deal with some of its 30 families he felt were of dubious (criminal) character. During this period, the Red Banks settlement had gained notoriety as a frontier haven for westward-moving outlaws and their families. One such family was that of Squire Samuel Mason. By that time, excluding the Cherokee, the free male inhabitants of Red Bank totaled 62. Later, in 1797, Captain Young of Mercer County, Kentucky and the &quot;Exterminators&quot;, a group of regulators under his leadership swiftly and violently drove out the remaining outlaw element in Red Banks.

Samuel Hopkins and the surveyor Thomas Allin visited Red Banks in 1797 and laid out plans for the future town of Henderson. It was formally established by the Kentucky legislature the same year. A distinguishing characteristic of the new town plan was unusually wide streets, reportedly to prevent a fire in one block from easily spreading to another. Even with diagonal parking spaces outlined on downtown streets today, the streets are wide enough to include two-way traffic and space left over for delivery trucks to park in the center of the streets without interfering. By October 29, 1799, a census for the city of Henderson showed a population of 183. The county had 423 residents, 207 slaves, and 412 horses.

===19th century===

A post office was established in the town in 1801; the city was formally incorporated on January 21, 1840.

By mid-century, Henderson County had become a major producer of tobacco, much of which was exported to Great Britain. The area was reported to be the largest dark tobacco producer in the world; large tobacco warehouses and stemmeries dotted the downtown Henderson area. Postcards from the era show long lines of horse- and mule-drawn wagons piled high with tobacco, waiting their turn to unload for shipment downriver. Some tobacco processors accumulated considerable fortunes.

===20th century===
Shortly before World War I, Henderson was said to have more millionaires per capita than any other city in the world. Great Britain, however, imposed a high tariff on imported tobacco after the war, wrecking the county and city&#x27;s export market. Tobacco warehouses and plants closed, and the community&#x27;s economic fortunes reversed. The last tobacco facility, the Soaper Tobacco Warehouse on Pennell Street, closed in 1984.

Henderson continued as a regional center into the 20th century. Businesses were concentrated in the downtown area. In the early 20th century, recognizable neighborhoods (unincorporated places) within the city and the outlying edges of town included Audubon, Weaverton, and Audubon Heights. Segments of Audubon and Weaverton were sometimes referred to as the &quot;East End&quot;, which held the second-largest business area after downtown Henderson.

===21st century===
A workplace shooting occurred at an Atlantis Plastics factory in Henderson on June 25, 2008. The gunman, 25-year-old Wesley Neal Higdon, shot and killed five people and critically injured a sixth person before taking his own life. The shooting is the worst in the history of Henderson County in terms of casualties, surpassing triple homicides occurring in 1799 and 1955.

==Geography==
Henderson is located in north-central Henderson County, south of Evansville, Indiana, and west of Owensboro, Kentucky. According to the United States Census Bureau, Henderson has a total area of , of which are land and , or 13.01%, are water. As the state line tends to follow the Indiana side of the river, most of the Ohio River going past Henderson is within the city limits.

Because the Indiana-Kentucky border is defined as the low-water mark on the north bank of the Ohio River as of 1792, and because the river changed course as a result of the New Madrid earthquake of 1812, a small portion of Henderson County (approximately long and wide), lies north of the current course of the river in what would appear to be part of Indiana. Both the Bi-State Vietnam Gold Star Bridges and the Ellis Park Race Course horse racing track are located entirely within Kentucky. The racetrack uses Indiana&#x27;s 812 area code despite officially being located in Kentucky.

===Natural disasters===
Henderson had unusual weather patterns in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The &quot;great sleet&quot; of 1901 fell for three weeks in February. &quot;Horses had to have special shoes to keep their footing on local roads.&quot;

In 1908 the Henderson area had high temperatures and a drought, which markedly reduced the flow of the Ohio River. The &quot;Henderson Daily Gleaner&quot; reported that &quot;boys were playing baseball every day in the middle of the old riverbed.&quot; All businesses were challenged and forced to close. A Henderson reporter wrote, &quot;[I]t is almost hazardous for even small gasoline boats to run&quot;.

On June 20, 1914, Henderson was hit by a &quot;baby cyclone&quot;. Jack Hudgions, local historian and newsman, wrote that &quot;hail as large as partridge eggs&quot; fell for ten minutes and that powerful winds uprooted giant trees &quot;and twisted limbs from shade trees in the city.&quot; In the northern part of Henderson, several buildings were blown down and wheat stocks were scattered. The storm lasted for more than 30 minutes, laying crops low throughout the county. Telephone lines were damaged and windows broken in the city and county by the hailstones. 26 days later, the city was hit by a tornado that left two dead and much of the city in ruins.

In 1937, of precipitation fell in 18 days over the Ohio River watershed, resulting in the Ohio River flood of 1937 and extensive damage. Henderson, on its bluff, was spared much of the damage that Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Louisville, Evansville, Paducah and other river cities suffered. Leigh Harris, the publisher of the &quot;Henderson Gleaner&quot; and &quot;Evening Journal&quot; newspapers, wrote, &quot;Henderson is on the river but never in it!&quot; Its favorable location helped the city attract new industries.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Henderson has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

<text>Robards () is a home rule-class city in Henderson County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 515 at the 2010 census, down from 564 at the 2000 census.

==History==

The name of the precinct has gone through three changes. In 1868 it was officially &quot;Robard&#x27;s Station&quot;. In 1880 it became &quot;Robard&quot;, and in 1924 the final change made it &quot;Robards&quot;. Robards is pronounced &quot;Robberds&quot;. The early settlers of the area included Reuben Moss, George Robards, George Eakins, Bennett Sandefur, Jordan Moss, Enoch Spencer, Thomas Reidout, Ben Wall, Nathan Smith, T. W. Royster, James McMullin, and Samuel McMullin Sr.

As far back as 1810 and through 1840, and even later, before Robards became a community, its site attracted daring horsemen who raced their steeds there on a race track, which was a straight half mile section of road, congregating to bet.

George Rudy&#x27;s school house was built before 1840, and between 1840 and 1848 the school had four teachers: Washington Sale, Dave Cowan, Frank Davis, and Joseph C. Norman. The Methodists built a church near the school, and in 1853 it was dedicated as &quot;McMullin&#x27;s Chapel&quot;. Two of the chief battles of the American Civil War in this county took place at what would become Robards.

J.D. Robards, for whom Robards was named, built the first house in 1867. This was a frame store house which was also used as a dry goods, grocery and general merchandise store. In this store, he carried on a business totaling from $25,000 to $40,000 per year. He also owned and operated a tobacco stemmery which employed 50 men and shipped directly to Europe. In the twenty years after the Civil War, Robards doubled in population. The average price of land in the 1800s was $20–$25 per acre. While tobacco, corn and wheat were the chief cash crops, a number of farmers were engaged in cattle raising.

In 1880, businesses in Robards included John W. Arnett and J.L. Burdon as physicians and surgeons; S.W. Spencer serving as manager of the Robard&#x27;s Station Co-operative Grange Store; and F.M. Eakins as the druggist as well as express agent on the Henderson Branch of the L&amp;N Railroad. Jasper Robards and John F. Schanebach accommodated the blacksmithing needs of the community. John W. Royster Jr. was a buyer and dealer of leaf tobacco. J.D. Robards ran the dry goods store. J.T. Williams was the carpenter. R.S. Triplett was also a merchant in the area. A.B. Sugg supplied the area&#x27;s stock needs. Mosco Cox was the local teacher. Robards in 1880 had a population of 100 and daily mail delivery. There was one ample frame building used for the district common school and for religious services. The Christian denomination had the only established church, with S.W. Cowan serving as pastor, in the 1880s. Three coal mines were opened during the 1880s and continued into the 1920s. In 1887, Starling reported that Robards had nine stores, a steam mill, a school building, a church with a seating capacity of 400, a large livery stable and a good hotel.

Lucy Furman, a fiction writer, told events of Robards Station as they related to the religious sect that flourished during the late 19th century. Her book, &quot;Stories of a Sanctified Town&quot; (1896), was so true to life that the residents of Robards recognized her characters in spite of changed names and combinations of locales. Present-day southbound travelers on U.S. 41 will see a road sign calling Robards &quot;the Sanctified Town&quot;.

<text>Columbus is a home rule-class city in Hickman County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 140 at the 2020 census, a decline from 229 in 2000. The city lies at the western end of the state, less than a mile from the Mississippi River.

Columbus-Belmont State Park borders the city to the west.

==History==
Columbus is the oldest town in Kentucky&#x27;s Jackson Purchase. It was first settled on the Mississippi floodplain in 1804 and known as &quot;Iron Banks&quot; after the site&#x27;s French name &quot;les rivages de fer&quot;. The long-held local rumor that President Thomas Jefferson planned to remove the American capital to the site has absolutely no basis in fact.

The name of the town was changed to Columbus in 1820 (in honor of the Italian explorer), the year the town received its first post office and was formally established by the state assembly. It was the original Hickman County seat before the transfer of the court to the more central location of Clinton. It was formally incorporated in 1860.

In 1861, after the American Civil War broke out, the town was seized by Confederate forces (including the Louisiana &quot;Shreveport Rebels&quot;. They fortified the site overlooking the Mississippi River, building Fort de Russey.) Confederate general Leonidas Polk tried to run and maintain a large anchor chain across the entire Mississippi at Columbus in order to block Union traffic downriver. Columbus was also the northernmost spur on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad. The Union responded by General Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s engaging the Confederates at Belmont on the Missouri shore. This was Grant&#x27;s first direct combat during the war. These actions are today commemorated at the Columbus-Belmont State Park on the bluff near Columbus.

In 1878, the American railroad legend Casey Jones got his first railroad job here, working as a telegrapher for the Mobile and Ohio at the age of 15.

The Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 deluged the town, as well as many areas downriver in the Mississippi Delta, where hundreds of thousands of acres were flooded. Survivors moved the town of Columbus, rebuilding it upon higher ground above the flood plain. Some of the original houses were saved and moved inland.

Given its isolated location in a rural area and the decline in river traffic, the town has lost population for years.

==Geography==
Columbus is located in northwestern Hickman County at (36.760176, -89.102840), on high ground east of the Mississippi River. It is bordered to the west by Columbus-Belmont State Park, which occupies a bluff rising nearly above the river.

Kentucky Route 58 leads southeast from Columbus to Clinton, the county seat. Kentucky Route 123 passes through the center of town, leading south then east to Clinton and north-northeast to Bardwell. Via Kentucky Route 80 it is east-northeast to Arlington.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

<doc id="115163" wikidata="Q3180829" url="?curid=115163" title="Earlington, Kentucky">
<text>Earlington is a home rule-class city in Hopkins County, Kentucky, in the United States. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 1,413, down from 1,649 at the 2000 census.

==History==
Founded in 1870 by the St. Bernard Coal Co., Earlington was named a year later, upon its incorporation, for John Baylis Earle, the man who stuck the first pick into the hillside at the opening of Hopkins County&#x27;s first commercial coal mine. Earle was a lawyer who was central to developing the coal industry in the region. Shortly after the town was founded, the Louisville and Nashville Railroad completed its line from Henderson to Earlington, and became the primary hauler in the area. The town boomed as a coal center and as the center of L&amp;N operations on the Evansville line.

The early development of Earlington can most readily be credited to St. Bernard Coal Company&#x27;s second president, John B. Atkinson. Originally from New Jersey, Atkinson taught school before becoming a civil engineer. He relocated to Kentucky from Boston in 1871 to take charge of mining operations at Earlington and eventually became president of the company.

Because of his background in education, Atkinson placed a great deal of emphasis on schools in Earlington, and modern buildings for the grade schools and high schools were built and furnished at the expense of St. Bernard. Other amenities offered at Earlington included housing, a library, an arboretum, and churches. Unusual for Western Kentucky at the time was the firm&#x27;s electric generating plant, which made Earlington one of the first fully electrified towns in the region.

Earlington boomed for its first 40 years, and was largely worked by black coal miners. Around World War I, consolidation in the mining industry sent coal company headquarters and profits to companies based in St. Louis, New York and other major cities, including the West Kentucky Coal Co. (based in New Jersey), which took over much of the Earlington operation. This drain of resources and severing of local control deeply affected Earlington and other mining towns nationwide, as did automation of many mining jobs. For Earlington, the closure of the L&amp;N depot in the 1960s was another major blow.

Like many coal towns, Earlington&#x27;s population has declined by more than half over the past century, particularly since the mines played out in the 1980s. Today, the sleepy town is primarily a local service center, with some trade to pass-through traffic along its I-69 interchange and its US 41 (Dixie Hwy.) commercial center.

==Education==
Until the mid-1970s, the city of Earlington operated an independent school system. The system served students from the primary grades until high school graduation. In 1967, the Earlington Yellowjackets won the state &quot;Sweet 16&quot; basketball tournament. During the 1960s, the champions of the Sweet 16 were typically from Jefferson County (Louisville) or Fayette County (Lexington), the largest population centers in the state. Earlington remains one of the smallest schools ever to win the &quot;Sweet 16&quot; in the modern era. The team was coached by Bob Fox, who was a native of Earlington and played basketball for Earlington in the late 1940s. He amassed an impressive coaching record at Earlingon at 141-26 and was inducted into the KHSAA Hall of Fame in 2001.

When the city school board decided to merge with the Hopkins County School System, the community was divided. Half of the students were enrolled at South Hopkins High School, about to the south, and the others went to West Hopkins High School, to the west. The division was made along the railroad line that bisects the town.

Earlington also had a private school that operated until the 1970s. Immaculate Conception, the only Roman Catholic parish in Earlington and the oldest parish in Hopkins County, operated a school periodically from the 1890s until the school was closed because of the building&#x27;s condition. The school had served students from kindergarten to the sixth grade. Located across the street from the parish building, the old school building has now been demolished.

==Geography==
Earlington bordered to the north by Madisonville, the county seat. U.S. Route 41 (Hopkinsville Road) passes through the center of Earlington, leading north to the center of Madisonville and southeast to Nortonville.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Earlington has a total area of , of which are land and , or 4.55%, are water.

The community received its post office on December 7, 1869, and was incorporated by the state assembly on March 31, 1873.

The Evansville, Henderson, &amp; Nashville was purchased by the St. Louis and Southeastern in 1872, which (following a reorganization) was purchased in turn by the L&amp;N in 1879.

The city was essentially destroyed by a fire in 1889, and the present historic district dates from the rebuilding that followed. Today, the former L&amp;N network makes up part of CSX Transportation, which operates a siding track in Hanson.

<text>Madisonville is a home rule-class city in and the county seat of Hopkins County, Kentucky, United States, located along Interstate 69 in the state&#x27;s Western Coal Fields region. The population was 19,591 at the 2010 census. Madisonville is a commercial center of the region and is home to Madisonville Community College.

==History==
Madisonville was founded in 1807 and named for then-Secretary of State James Madison. It was named the seat of Hopkins County in 1808 and formally incorporated in 1810.

Hopkins County and Madisonville were divided by the Civil War. Union supporters joined a regiment recruited locally by James Shackleford; Al Fowler recruited Confederate troops. The courthouse in Madisonville was burned by Confederates led by Gen. Hylan B. Lyon on December 17, 1864, as they passed through western Kentucky. While Kentucky remained mostly in the Union, half the state had seceded at the Russellville Convention and was controlled by the Confederacy early in the war before being conquered by the Union.

Farming was the major occupation in Hopkins County for most of the 1800s, with tobacco the leading crop. Around 1837 an outcropping of coal was discovered, and the first coal mine in the county opened in 1869. Mining did not become a major industry until the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad pushed its line southward from Henderson through Madisonville and toward Nashville in 1870.

Madisonville was home to schools for African Americans including Atkinson Literary and Industrial College.

From 1892 to 1912 &quot;The Hustler&quot;, originally &quot;The Madisonville Hustler&quot;, was a newspaper serving Madisonville.

By the early 1900s, Madisonville was a rail hub, coal mining center, and had a large tobacco market. This continued until the 1960s when manufacturing and service industries came to the area.

==Storms==
On November 15, 2005, a tornado ripped through the city, destroying some parts of it. The tornado began to form around 3:00 PM. The neighborhood near the Madisonville Country Club was greatly affected by the storm. The home of Madisonville resident and former Boston Celtics star Frank Ramsey was destroyed in the storm. Mayor Karen Cunningham ordered a curfew in parts of the city and declared a state of emergency.

This lovely home stood for another 132 years until it was finally destroyed by fire on September 16, 1936.

An elementary and middle school continued to be served at the same location, until the elementary school was consolidated to form Southside Elementary School and the middle school to form South Hopkins Middle School in the mid-1990s. The former school has been renovated and serves the community as a church.

<text>Nortonville is a home rule-class city in Hopkins County, Kentucky, in the United States. The population was 1,204 as of the 2010 census.

==History==
Nortonville owes its existence to the railroad industry and is named for Eckstein Norton, a Kentucky-born investment banker who started as a clerk in a country store in Russellville, Kentucky, in 1846. Norton participated in the creation of the Elizabethtown and Paducah Railroad in the late 1860s (east-west tracks). He then purchased of land in what would become &quot;Norton Village&quot;, later changed to &quot;Nortonville&quot; around 1900. Norton became a shipping agent for the Illinois Central Railroad, which eventually acquired the Elizabethtown &amp; Paducah Railroad. The north–south railroad, named the Evansville, Henderson and Nashville, was completed through Nortonville in 1872. It was purchased in a foreclosure sale in 1879 by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad. Norton became president of the L&amp;N Railroad on October 6, 1886. By 1886, Nortonville was one of only nine towns in the L&amp;N system to have a steam hoist to unload and transfer freight. By then, the city was concentrated around a junction of the IC and L&amp;N Railroads. Nortonville saw growth after 1902, when investors purchased land from the Norton heirs and opened a shaft coal mine as the Nortonville Coal Company. They also operated an electric power plant.

Nortonville implemented its first water system in 1936 and paved its streets in 1956. A centralized sewage treatment system was built in the late 1970s, opening an opportunity for continued growth.

<doc id="115173" wikidata="Q2111634" url="?curid=115173" title="Anchorage, Kentucky">
<text>Anchorage is a home rule-class city in eastern Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 2,500 as of the 2020 census, up from 2,348 at the 2010 census and an estimated 2,432 in 2018. It is a suburb of Louisville.

==History==
The land that is now Anchorage was a part of Isaac Hite&#x27;s 1773 land grant, which awarded most of the land in today&#x27;s Jefferson County to officers in the Virginia militia, in exchange for their service in the French and Indian War. Early maps refer to the area as &quot;Hite&#x27;s Mill&quot;, and it has also been known as &quot;Hobbs Station&quot;. Part of Hite&#x27;s original grant now makes up the grounds of Central State Hospital and E. P. &quot;Tom&quot; Sawyer State Park.

The nautical name is a bit odd, considering the city is over from the Ohio River. The origin is The Anchorage, the estate of riverboat captain and early resident James W. Goslee, and was chosen to honor him when the city incorporated in 1878, three years after his death. Tradition says that an anchor hanging inside the rim of a locomotive wheel at the center of town was taken by Goslee from his ship, the &quot;Matamora&quot;.

The Louisville and Frankfort Railroad (later purchased by the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad) was built through the area in 1849. The development of an interurban rail line in 1901 allowed faster travel between Anchorage and Louisville, as well as other towns in the area.

The heavily shaded city, with temperatures often noticeably cooler than in Downtown Louisville, became a popular location for summer homes for wealthy Louisvillians. One such resident was brewing magnate Isaac Wolfe Bernheim, still remembered locally for his philanthropy. In 1914, Bernheim commissioned the firm of Frederick Law Olmsted to design a plan for Anchorage, which would incorporate stone bridges and triangle intersections, similar to Olmsted&#x27;s plans for Louisville&#x27;s park system.

The city has long been known as home of some of the area&#x27;s wealthiest citizens, though the large old estates have mostly been divided up and many new, still upscale, houses have been built in the area, especially since 1977. Part of the city is designated as the Anchorage Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

Papa John&#x27;s Pizza founder John Schnatter is a resident and owns about 6% of the land in Anchorage, including much of the city center. He restored an interurban rail station, three historic buildings and built a fourth in a similar style in the city&#x27;s center, with plans to build a bank, an upscale restaurant, and a hiking trail, which opened as the Anchorage Trail in June 2008. In an interview, he told the &quot;Courier-Journal&quot; that his goal was purely to &quot;preserve the city&#x27;s character&quot;.

<text>Audubon Park is a home rule-class city in central Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 1,433 as of the 2020 census, down from 1,473 at the 2010 census. It is located about south of downtown Louisville and is surrounded on all sides by the city of Louisville.

==History==
Audubon Park was developed residentially in the early 20th century on of hilly pastureland once owned by Gen. William Preston, who in turn had been granted the land in 1774 from the British government as payment for his services during the French and Indian War.

The land was sold to G. Robert Hunt in 1906, and the Audubon Park Country Club was built by avid golfer Russell Houston. The Audubon Park Realty Co. purchased the land in 1912 and named the neighborhood after wildlife painter John James Audubon. All but two of the city&#x27;s 20 streets are named after birds.

Development was very slow until Louisville Gas and Electric laid gas mains and installed streetlights in the 1920s, at which point it was estimated that a new house was begun every two weeks. Most houses are traditional in design, with styles including Neo-colonial, Dutch colonial and Neo-federal, though some Craftsman-style California bungalows are present.

An early streetcar spur route ran to a station house near the center of the park (the station house has been converted to a private residence and still stands). The line was discontinued in the 1920s, although the tracks were not entirely removed until 1975. The city was formally incorporated by the state assembly in 1941.

The city is known for its straight, tree-lined streets (facilitated by rear utility lines where possible) and six small neighborhood parks. Its entrances are marked by large stone gateways. Two annual traditions are the spring dogwood festival, and the fall Arts and Crafts festival. The city was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.

<doc id="115176" wikidata="Q382769" url="?curid=115176" title="Barbourmeade, Kentucky">
<text>Barbourmeade is a home rule-class city in Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States. It was formally incorporated by the state assembly in 1962. The population was 1,216 as of the 2020 census, stagnant from 1,218 at the 2010 census.

The community derives its name from Thomas and Richard Barbour, early settlers for whom Barbour Lane is named. Barbourmeade incorporated as a city in October 1962, with a population of 150.

==History==
Present-day Barbourmeade is part of the loosely defined historic community known as Springdale, after the farm that stood on the south side of Brownsboro Road beginning in 1830. Though it is not a formally recognized neighborhood or district within Louisville, nor does it have official boundaries, older businesses in the community still retain the Springdale name.

Barbour Lane, which runs through the middle of the community, was originally the entry drive to the Barbour house, which sat on the Barbour family&#x27;s 500-acre tract of land between Brownsboro Road and River Road. The original Barbour house was destroyed in the 1974 tornado, which terminated near Barbour Lane.

The intersection of present-day Barbour Lane and Brownsboro Road, then a toll road known as the Louisville-Brownsboro Turnpike, was home to a gristmill, grocery and blacksmith shop as far back as 1879, as well as a tavern known as the Seven Mile House for its location from downtown Louisville. This intersection remains a commercial hub for the immediate community, serviced by a convenience store and gas station, dry cleaner, animal hospital and automotive shop. A series of liquor stores have also been located at the intersection since 1978, when one opened amidst considerable protest from members of the community. Springdale Presbyterian Church was established in 1882, with much of its present-day structure constructed in 1964.

Beginning in the late 19th century until it was subdivided in the 1950s, much of present-day Barbourmeade and the surrounding portions of Louisville&#x27;s East End were occupied by potato farms. Farmers from the area were instrumental in organizing the St. Matthews Produce Exchange, the second-largest potato shipper in the country, located in nearby St. Matthews, known locally as &quot;the potato capital of the world.&quot; Among these farmers was John &quot;The Potato King&quot; Stutzenberger Sr., said at the time to be &quot;one of Jefferson County&#x27;s best known-farmers,&quot; and whose family farm occupied a large portion of present-day Barbourmeade. The area was described in 1941 as home to &quot;Jefferson County&#x27;s most fertile land and least experienced farmers,&quot; owing to the influx of wealthy hobby farmers from the city. A farmhouse facing Brownsboro Road built by the Schneider family, who operated a truck farm on the site, is one of the few pre-World War II buildings remaining in Barbourmeade.

After World War II, potato production in the area declined and farm acreages in Springdale and along Brownsboro Road were reduced or sold off. In 1953, Stutzenberger himself blamed the decline in American potato consumption on &quot;diet propaganda.&quot; That year, an Oldham County developer named Joe Wilhoyte purchased a 45-acre tract of farmland at Brownsboro Road and Barbour Lane from Albert D. Stutzenberger and his sister Anna Hahn, two children of John Stutzenberger Sr. Albert Stutzenberger was an amateur farmer, languages and music instructor at the Kentucky Military Institute, and an authority on collecting souvenir spoons.

The Barbourmeade subdivision was platted that year from the farmland Wilhoyte had purchased. As with many suburban developments of the era, the street names are a mix of Italian and Spanish language-derived place names (Sorrento, Coronado, Pompano), plants and animals (Nandina, Foxglove, Pipilo), former place markers and geographic features of the land (Pine Ridge, Old Gate) and names of the developers&#x27; family and colleagues (Breeland, Dinah). The suffix &quot;-meade&quot; derives from a poetic variation on the Old English word &quot;mead,&quot; referring to a meadow or pasture. The first new single-family home constructions went on the market in 1953. The housing stock consists of a variety of popular postwar styles, including Colonial Revival, ranch-style, split-levels and Cape Cods. Along with nearby Plantation, Barbourmeade was one of the earliest residential developments in the area.

To accommodate the growing population in the area, Jefferson County Public Schools opened Norton Elementary School in 1967. The school is named for WAVE founder and president George Norton Jr. and philanthropist and artist Jane Norton, who lived on nearby Wolf Pen Branch Road.

In 1988, the city commission disbanded the Barbourmeade police department for budgetary reasons. The Barbourmeade police department also provided police services for Brownsboro Farm, Ten Broeck, Langdon Place and Rolling Hills. Barbourmeade has been served by the Graymoor-Devondale Police Department since 2011.

In 1999, Barbourmeade annexed the neighboring community of Brownsboro Gardens after a protracted legal battle with Louisville-Jefferson County relating to a metro-wide ban on annexations.

==Geography==
Barbourmeade is located in northeastern Jefferson County. It is bordered to the northeast by Brownsboro Farm, to the southeast by Manor Creek, Broeck Pointe and Goose Creek, to the west by Spring Valley, and to the north, east, and south by Louisville. Interstate 71 runs along the northern border of Barbourmeade (but with no direct access), and Kentucky Route 22 (Brownsboro Road) forms part of the southern border. Downtown Louisville is to the southwest, and Crestwood is to the northeast up Route 22.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Barbourmeade has a total area of , all land.

Barbourmeade is informally separated into three sections. The Hillvale section, located southwest of Barbour Lane, is named for the road. The Norton section, located on the northeast side of Barbour Lane, is named for the elementary school. The Brownsboro Vista section is on the southeastern side of Highway 22, and is named for the road. The Brownsboro Vista section is the former Brownsboro Gardens subdivision, annexed in 1999.

==Arts and culture==
Omnicron Records, a small record label, was based in Barbourmeade in the mid-1990s. Their releases included the debut album by Hotel Roy, the first commercially available recordings of future My Morning Jacket frontman Jim James.

==Notable people==
Former basketball player and coach Wade Houston and his son, professional basketball player Allan Houston, lived in Barbourmeade from 1986 to 1989 while the younger Houston attended nearby Ballard High School.

Attorney and judge William E. McAnulty Jr., the first African American justice on the Kentucky Supreme Court, was a Barbourmeade resident in the 1980s.

== Transportation ==
Brownsboro Road and its predecessor, the turnpike, have long been the primary means for accessing Barbourmeade, first by horse and carriage, and then by automobile. The hilly terrain and sharp turns on Brownsboro Road crossing Goose Creek make accessing it by bicycle or on foot difficult. A Louisville and Interurban Railroad line serving Brownsboro Road was planned in the early 1910s, but never came to fruition.

Barbourmeade has been described as a typical &quot;car suburb,&quot; with easy access to Interstates 71 and 264 being a primary selling point to car commuters. The neighborhood has not been directly served by public transit since the late 1990s, when the portion of TARC Route 15 between Holiday Manor Shopping Center and Standard Country Club was eliminated.

On April 3, 2015, heavy rains washed away an old stone culvert over Goose Creek, just west of Barbourmeade, causing a cave-in on Brownsboro Road and cutting off the city from Interstates 71 and 264, and commercial centers located to the west. The road was reopened after five months.

Within the city, pedestrians, cyclists and automobiles share the roads. In the absence of sidewalks, pedestrians generally walk on the streets facing traffic. In 2006, Barbourmeade received a Safe Routes to School grant from the state of Kentucky to upgrade pedestrian facilities for students walking and biking to Norton Elementary. Portions of Pompano Drive and Sorrento Avenue near the school are marked with pedestrian crossings and shared on-street pedestrian paths on the shoulders.

<text>Glenview is a 6th-class city along the southern bank of the Ohio River in northeastern Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States The population was 531 at the 2010 census.

Glenview has the 2nd-highest per capita income within Kentucky and the 74th-highest in the United States. The city is known for its old estate homes on high bluffs overlooking the Ohio River.

==History==
 of the surrounding land were originally owned by James Smalley Bate and named &quot;Berry Hill&quot; for his former Virginia home. The estate was purchased in 1868 by meat packer James C. McFerran. McFerran&#x27;s horse farm was named &quot;Glen View&quot;. After his death in 1885, John E. Green acquired the farm and renamed it &quot;Glenview Stock Farm&quot;. The community received its post office on May 11, 1893.

In the late 19th century, wealthy families from Louisville began moving east to build summer homes in communities such as Anchorage. Some of these eventually became full-time residences. Early residents of Glenview cooperated with other communities to open the Louisville, Harrods Creek and Westport Railroad in 1877, a commuter rail line in use until its abandonment in the 1950s. Some of Louisville&#x27;s most influential families, including the Binghams, the Ballards, and the Belknaps, moved into the area after the opening of the railroad.

Many houses are part of the Glenview Historic District. Several buildings are individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places including the Ballard School, Boxhill and Lincliff.

Some developers have played off Glenview&#x27;s reputation, establishing similarly named communities at Glenview Manor and Glenview Hills in the 1960s and 70s. Louisville attempted to annex Glenview in 1983, which prompted its residents to seek a separate incorporation from the state legislature. This was granted in 1985. Many of the houses are part of the Glenview Historic District, which is on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Hurstbourne is a home rule-class city in Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 4,216 at the 2010 census, up from 3,884 at the time of the 2000 U.S. census. It is part of the Louisville Metro Government.

==History==
The land of the present city was part of a military grant to Henry Harrison. It was surveyed by John Floyd in 1774 and first settled by Maj. William Linn, who erected Linn&#x27;s Station along Beargrass Creek in 1779. It was probably located along the east side of what is now Hurstbourne Parkway and at the time formed a part of the road from the Falls of the Ohio to Fort Harrod. The victims of the 1781 Long Run Massacre were on their way to this site from Squire Boone&#x27;s Station when they were attacked by Indians and British soldiers. Finding their claim to the land&#x27;s title questionable, Linn&#x27;s heirs abandoned the site in the 1790s.

In 1789, however, Colonel Richard Anderson purchased of land in the area and established his estate under the name &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Retreat&quot;. His house suffered damage in the 1811 earthquake, was struck by lightning, and was demolished in the 1840s. By 1842, John Jeremiah Jacob owned the property and erected Lyndon Hall, now part of the Hurstbourne Country Club&#x27;s clubhouse.

In 1915, the Hert family acquired the property and renamed it &quot;Hurstbourne&quot;. Hurstbourne Parkway was created in 1935 when an earlier lane was widened. By 1965, the property was called &quot;Highbaugh Farms&quot; and, owing to the expansion of Louisville, commercial and residential development began. It incorporated as a city in 1982 to prevent its annexation by Louisville. Almost all of the available land inside the city&#x27;s limits was developed by 1990.

Development in the 1970s, however, rediscovered the ruins of the Anderson house, which was excavated and rebuilt by local developer Leroy Highbaugh Jr. He moved his family into the rebuilt Soldier&#x27;s Retreat in 1983, and it now forms a local landmark.

==Geography==
Hurstbourne is located in east-central Jefferson County. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 0.63%, are water.

<text>Indian Hills is a home rule-class city along the Ohio River in Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 2,860 as of the 2020 census. Indian Hills and the nearby cities of Mockingbird Valley, Glenview, and Anchorage have been cited as Louisville&#x27;s most prosperous suburbs since the mid-20th century. Indian Hills was among the nation&#x27;s highest-income places as of the 2000 U.S. census.

==Geography==
Indian Hills is in northeastern Jefferson County. It is bordered to the northeast by Glenview and Riverwood, to the east by Northfield, to the southeast by Windy Hills, to the south by Druid Hills and Brownsboro Village, to the southwest by Rolling Fields, and to the north by the Ohio River, which on the far bank carries the Indiana border. On all other sides, Indian Hills is bordered by the Louisville/Jefferson County consolidated government.

Interstate 71 runs through the northern part of Indian Hills, but with no direct access. U.S. Route 42 forms the community&#x27;s southern boundary, leading west to downtown Louisville.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city spans an area of , of which , or 0.89%, is water. The Muddy Fork of Beargrass Creek runs through Indian Hills. The region is hilly karst with numerous visible rock outcroppings, and the area is densely forested. This terrain, along with the large house lots, have been mentioned as defining features of the community.

Over a third of the land is intentionally undeveloped, mostly woodlands. Ten areas were originally developed by the Olmsted Brothers landscaping firm, and other tracts have been donated to the city over the years. Most of the undeveloped land is on Indian Hills Trail between Louisville Country Club and the Ohio River. Caperton Swamp Nature Preserve is also in the city.

The undeveloped areas around Beargrass Creek and nearly all of the city north of Interstate 71 are in the 100-year flood plain, and seasonal flooding is common. The intersection of Indian Hills Road and River Road is closed occasionally in spring due to high water.

==History==
===Indian Hill Stock Farm===
The community is named for local settler John Veech&#x27;s Indian Hill Stock Farm, for a time one of Kentucky&#x27;s largest horse farms. Veech held over as early as 1805, and his family continued to own most of the local land into the 20th century. The Georgian-style Veech house still stands at 125 Indian Hills Trail; the farm&#x27;s springhouse is at 119 Arrowhead Road. (Both have been approved for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, but the property owners have so far opted against listing.) An 1877 &quot;Louisville Courier-Journal&quot; article claims the name was adopted from the hundreds of Indians camped at the site at the time of Louisville&#x27;s founding in 1778, but naming developments after Indians was generally fashionable in the late 19th century.

===Development===
The Veech family owned much of the land into the 20th century. In 1911, the family contracted the Olmsted Brothers landscaping firm to plan the development of a golf course and subdivision. Two Indian Hills houses from this era are on the National Register of Historic Places, both in the northeastern section of the city: Midlands was built in 1913 for a member of the locally prominent Belknap family, and Blankenbaker Station was built in 1916 and was one of Louisville&#x27;s first &quot;fireproof&quot; homes. By 1924, the Louisville Country Club had been completed, and the Semonin Company further developed the initial subdivision (sometimes called Indian Hills-Country Club) from 1927 to 1941. Initial lot restrictions required houses to be sold for at least $10,000, and this was raised to $20,000 in 1946. The state assembly formally incorporated the community on December 15, 1941. Calumet Road was the last street of the original Indian Hills plan to be built, with construction delayed until the 1950s due to the steep terrain.

===Battles with Louisville===
In 1954, Louisville proposed annexing Indian Hills in order to extend sewer service into the area and other developments further east. This met with such opposition that &quot;The Courier-Journal&quot; was unable to find a single supporter of annexation or sewers in Indian Hills. Two years later, the Indian Hills plans were folded into the larger &quot;Mallon Plan&quot; to annex most of Louisville&#x27;s outlying suburbs into the city government. Leaflets distributed in Indian Hills claimed taxes would go up, Louisville buses would enter Indian Hills, and sewer service would lead to expensive and unnecessary bills. Louisville voters approved the plan by a large majority, but suburban voters rejected it by a 2-to-1 margin, and the Mallon Plan was shelved.

In the wake of the annexation vote, Indian Hills began exerting greater political autonomy, closing down a used car lot on Brownsboro Road, annexing the land, and encouraging its redevelopment for residences. (The triangle of land involved now houses the homes around Old Brownsboro Court and a small shopping center.) The city also sued the Louisville Gas &amp; Electric Company, seeking to remove the newly installed electrical towers east of Indian Hills Trail. LG&amp;E won the case by arguing that the land in question was scrubland unsuitable for commercial development.

In the 1980s, Louisville again proposed sewers for Indian Hills, this time without annexation. Indian Hills rejected the plan by a 4-to-1 margin in 1988, but extending a line through it was the only economical way to provide access to communities further east that voted for the service. Legal challenges delayed construction until 1992, but a line was then constructed through the city without connecting to any local houses. In 1995, a local resident was sued by both his neighbors and the county to deal with his overflowing septic tank; he and the septic tank companies claimed the problem could not be fixed without connecting the tank to the city sewer system. Mayor Jeanne Beam, who had opposed sewers throughout her 22-year service, abruptly resigned in June after the city commissioners announced they would no longer oppose connection. Beginning in 1999, the project became the most expensive sewer construction in Jefferson County history, costing residents $20,800–$31,200 each.

Also in 1999, Indian Hills was reincorporated after an election that merged the former Indian Hills with the neighboring cities of Indian Hills-Cherokee Section (inc. 1955), Robinswood (inc. 1965), and Winding Falls (inc. 1977). (An earlier attempt to also annex the community of Riverwood failed in 1998; Rolling Fields was approached about joining the merger but declined to participate.) The new city reached the population threshold for 4th-class status, giving it greater local control (particularly over zoning) ahead of the merger of Louisville and Jefferson County into a single metro government. It also permitted the merger of two separate local police departments.

Despite the merger, the Kentucky Secretary of State continues to list Indian Hills-Cherokee Section, Robinswood, and Winding Falls as separate and active cities.

<text>Jeffersontown is a home rule-class city in Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 28,474 at the 2020 census.

It is a major suburb of Louisville. When the Louisville Metro government was established in 2003, Jeffersontown chose to retain its status as an independent city. It is the metro area&#x27;s largest municipality outside Louisville. Locally, the city is often referred to by the abbreviated name J-town.

==History==
Before European exploration, this was occupied by succeeding cultures of Native Americans. They hunted the area for its rich game, including bison herds. The bison created paths through the forests and meadows for their seasonal migrations that were later used by Native Americans and, in turn, by Europeans and Americans alike.

Located in southeastern Jefferson County, along the north central border of Kentucky, Jeffersontown was initially developed in the late 1700s as a stopover and trading station for early European-American pioneers on their way to the Falls of the Ohio at Louisville. Farmers began to cultivate the rich land, which was surveyed by Thomas Bullitt in 1773 and John Floyd the next year. The Hites, Tylers, and Oldhams all settled the area under land grants given to veterans for military service following the American Revolutionary War, as the new government was cash poor.

In 1794, Abraham Bruner purchased of land. In May 1797, he successfully petitioned the Jefferson County Fiscal Court to incorporate a section of his land as the city of Jefferson named either after the county or after Thomas Jefferson, then the vice president of the United States. The city was long known as Bruner&#x27;s Town or Brunerstown by its inhabitants, but the usage Jefferson Town eventually became adopted as its present name.

A large, 600-acre area from the pioneer days has been preserved since the late 20th century and recognized as the Tyler Settlement Rural Historic District. It is used largely for agricultural purposes. This district is east of Jeffersontown; it contains several of the Tylers&#x27; original log cabins and barns. A large portion of the Tyler settlement is known as the Blackacre Nature Preserve. This 170-acre tract is used by Jefferson County public schools as part of their environmental education.

The Tree Board was established after it was noted that many of the older trees were dying or in poor health. In 2003, the National Arbor Day Foundation approved the application for the city to receive formal status as a Tree City USA. Many new trees have been planted in residents&#x27; front yards and Kingsley Green Park because of grants.

<text>Lyndon is a home rule-class city in Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 11,002 at the 2010 census, up from 9,369 at the 2000 census.

Incorporated on May 10, 1965, Lyndon became part of the new Louisville Metro government in 2003. It remains an independent city with its own mayor and emergency services and is not counted in Louisville&#x27;s population although its citizens can vote for the mayor of Louisville and Metro Council members.

==History==

The area is the home of Oxmoor Farm, the residence of Alexander Scott Bullitt, one of the drafters of Kentucky&#x27;s first constitution.

At some point after 1865, the L&amp;N offered local landowner Alvin Wood connection to their network provided that he pay the costs of constructing the station and donate the land for the spur. He did so, and in 1871 the Lyndon depot began service. The town&#x27;s etymology remains uncertain, although some connect it to Linn&#x27;s Station and others to explorer William Linn.

The Bellevoir-Ormsby Village was built in 1867 and Kentucky Military Institute moved to the town in 1896. Central State Hospital is also near Lyndon.

In 1963, Lyndon&#x27;s post office was subsumed by the Louisville system. Lyndon was incorporated soon after in order to avoid annexation by the neighboring city of St. Matthews.

==Geography==
Lyndon is located in northeastern Jefferson County. It is east of downtown Louisville. Nearby Louisville suburbs include Graymoor-Devondale to the northwest, St. Matthews to the southwest, Hurstbourne to the south, and Anchorage to the east. U.S. Route 60 (Shelbyville Road) forms part of the southern boundary of Lyndon.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which , or 0.91%, are water.

==Demographics==
At the 2010 census, there were 11,002 people, 5,374 households and 2,585 families residing in the city.

<text>Middletown is an independent, home rule-class city in Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States, and a suburb of Louisville. The population was 7,218 at the 2010 census. The city is home to the main campus of the largest church in the state (and one of the country&#x27;s largest Protestant churches), the Southeast Christian Church.

==History==

The City of Middletown was originally incorporated in 1797 by the Jefferson County Court on 500 acres of land lying on a branch of the forks of Beargrass Creek that originally belonged to Jacob Meyers and Culberth Harrison. Though there is no recorded explanation why the city was named Middletown, it is commonly believed that that name was chosen because the town was in the &quot;middle&quot; of the two older cities of Louisville which was founded June 24, 1778, and Shelbyville, which was founded December 20, 1792. In 1871 the Kentucky General Assembly amended the original charter to increase Middletown&#x27;s boundaries.

After failing to hold elections and collect taxes after 1919, Circuit Judge Macauley Smith dissolved the city&#x27;s charter on July 26, 1960, and Middletown lost its 163-year-old city status. The city&#x27;s charter was restored as a sixth-class city on August 7, 1976, with a commission form of government. On July 15, 1982, this was upgraded to the status of a fourth-class city.

<text>Mockingbird Valley is a home rule-class city in Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States. Since incorporation, there has been some interest in making it a historic preservation district, largely to prevent unwanted development. The population was 167 at the 2010 census. It has the highest &quot;per capita&quot; income of any location in Kentucky and the tenth-highest of any location in the United States.

Located directly to the east of Louisville along the Ohio River, Mockingbird Valley is frequently referred to as a &quot;country enclave&quot; and is noted for its rural feel. It is located on river bluffs and rolling hills, with large homes set back from the road, heavy tree density, bridges and walls using traditional local materials, as well as undisturbed rock outcroppings. One-third of the roads are privately owned, and the entire city is zoned residential except for a small commercial parking lot.

==History==
The first house, Rock Hill, was built in 1840 near River Road and still remains. Although it was initially agricultural, wealthy Louisvillians eventually began building summer homes in Mockingbird Valley, starting with Atilla Cox in 1905 (nearby Cox Park is named for his wife Carrie). An interurban railroad soon allowed for commuting to Downtown Louisville, and the first year-round house was built by Stuart English Duncan in 1908. Planned subdivisions were soon built in the area: the Jarvis addition in 1912, Green Hills in 1924, and Overbrook in 1929. It incorporated as a city in 1940. Development has continued slowly as late as 2006, with a final subdivision, Mockingbird Valley River Bluff, being built on 15 lots covering . The city&#x27;s history is roughly similar to that of Glenview and Anchorage, two other eastern Jefferson County cities.

The Louisville Country Club is located near Mockingbird Valley, its clubhouse built in 1910 and designed by the architectural firm of McDonald &amp; Dodd. The golf course was originally designed by Tom Bendelow and redesigned in 1924 by Walter Travis In 1999, it was one of several private clubs named in a discrimination lawsuit and was eventually forced to turn over its membership records, though no investigation was ever conducted by the state Human Rights Commission. It admitted its first black member in February 2006.

==Geography==

==Wildlife==
Numerous wild animals reside in Mockingbird Valley, including white-tailed deer, coyote, red fox, groundhog, opossum, raccoon and the occasional mink. Birding enthusiasts have also recorded sightings of wild turkey, blue heron, turkey vulture, red tail hawk, pileated woodpecker, and the great horned owl. Due to the karst topography, reptiles and amphibians such as the box turtle, ring neck snake, red salamander and five-lined skink are also common.

<doc id="115232" wikidata="Q2377992" url="?curid=115232" title="Newburg, Louisville">
<text>Newburg is a former census-designated place in Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 20,636 at the 2000 census. On January 6, 2003, the area was annexed to the city of Louisville due to a merger between the city and Jefferson County&#x27;s unincorporated communities. Newburg is now thought to be a neighborhood (by local media) within the now merged city of Louisville.

==History==

The area now called Newburg was settled in the 1820s by four German families, and was a small village called Newburgh a decade later. The &#x27;h&#x27; was dropped and the modern spelling emerged as the name of the post office by the end of the 19th century.

Newburg has historically had a black population, once centered on the nearby Petersburg area, at the junction of Shepherdsville and Newburg Roads. By 1851, Eliza and Henry Tevis, a free black couple who owned slaves, operated a farm in the area. After the Civil War, freed blacks bought land in the area and started farms.

Into the 1900s, Petersburg and Newburg were still surrounded by farmland. Newburg at some point had become the chosen name for the area, most likely because it was the name of the post office. Suburban sprawl reached the area by the 1960s, and it became popular with middle-class blacks leaving the city for suburbs. The area remains predominantly black.

From 1982 to 1987, Newburg was an incorporated city; however, it was an unpopular move and was eventually dissolved.

With the help of the Library Foundation and community support a new $1.9 million, 8300-square-foot education and technology driven library was completed and opened in Newburg in August 2009.

<text>Okolona is a former census-designated place (CDP) in southern Louisville/Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States. It is centered on the intersection of Preston Highway and the Outer Loop. The population was 17,807 at the 2000 census. When the government of Jefferson County merged with the city of Louisville, Kentucky in 2003, residents of Okolona also became citizens of &quot;Louisville Metro&quot;. As a result, Okolona is said to be a neighborhood within the city limits of Louisville.

It was first settled by farmers from Pennsylvania and Virginia in the late 18th century. It was called Lone Oak in the late 19th century. However, a town near Paducah, Kentucky already claimed that name for its post office, so the town rearranged the words into &quot;Okolona&quot;. Farming, as well as logging and charcoal production were important industries around this time.

An interurban line was extended to the area in 1905, but residential development did not pick up until General Electric Appliance Park was opened nearby in 1953.

Okolona sits at exactly the same elevation as Downtown Louisville despite being from the Ohio River, making it one of the city&#x27;s most flood prone areas. Several square miles of wetlands had to be drained in the area to make development possible.

<doc id="115240" wikidata="Q2251937" url="?curid=115240" title="Pleasure Ridge Park, Louisville">
<text>Pleasure Ridge Park (PRP) is a former census-designated place (CDP) in southwest Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 26,212 at the 2010 census. In 2003, the area was annexed to the city of Louisville due to a merger between the city and Jefferson County&#x27;s unincorporated communities. Pleasure Ridge Park is now said to be a neighborhood within the city limits of Louisville by local media.

This community is served by the Pleasure Ridge Park Fire Protection District. The Pleasure Ridge Park Fire Protection District is one of seven volunteer and combination departments that make up the Jefferson County Fire Service. This department covers 62 square miles and serves the citizens of Pleasure Ridge Park, Valley Station, Lake Dreamland and Rubbertown Area in southwestern Jefferson County, Kentucky.

Pleasure Ridge Park High School is located in the area.

==History==
The area was first sparsely settled by French and German Catholics in the mid-19th century, and the first church, St. Andrew&#x27;s Church, was built in 1851, and although it no longer exists, a major local road still bears its name. What is now the Paducah and Louisville Railway built a station in the area in 1874, and a summer resort and hotel called Paine Hotel developed around a shaded ridge on Muldraugh Hill, what came to be called Pleasure Ridge. The name Pleasure Ridge Park was chosen for the first post office in the area in 1876. The area continued to be popular for tourism until World War I.

By the 1950s, the area began expanding rapidly as subdivisions were built. People moving to the area liked its cheap land and location reasonably close to both Downtown Louisville and Fort Knox. Residents blocked a 1984 attempt by the nearby city of Shively to annex Pleasure Ridge Park.

In 2002, a team from Pleasure Ridge Park won the Little League World Series.

Since the completion of the Greenbelt Highway many subdivisions have been built along or near the belt to allow for easy access to I-264 and I-265. Dixie Highway is now home to many national retail and restaurant chains that have opened in this part of Louisville.

There have been an abundance of new jobs in the Riverport area near the Ohio River. Many of these jobs have, of course, sprung up because of the UPS Worldport Expansion at the airport. Most of these jobs are in warehousing and logistics, but still provide the area with new employment opportunities.

<text>Seneca Gardens is a home rule-class city in Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States, and a part of the Louisville Metro government. With the single exception of the Keneseth Israel Synagogue, all buildings within city limits are residential. The population was 696 as of the 2010 census.

==History==
The site of the present city was originally part of Farmington, the 1810 estate of the Hon. John Speed and his second wife Lucy Gilmer Fry. Abraham Lincoln was a friend of the judge&#x27;s son Joshua and spent three weeks at Farmington in 1841 while courting Mary Todd of Lexington. Lincoln would later name Joshua his Attorney General during his second administration.

The Speeds sold off sections of their estate. Most of the present area of Seneca Gardens was purchased from the family in 1825 and 1846 by the German gardener Jacob Wetstein. He established the Methodist Westein Community Church on the corner of his property facing Taylorsville Road, and local legend credited him with participating in the Underground Railroad. Wetstein&#x27;s granddaughter&#x27;s husband Edward F. Weigel, president of the Wetstein Land Company, mortgaged the estate to participate in the development of Broadmeade.

The remainder of the community was purchased from the Speeds by another German immigrant, Paul Discher, who was listed in the 1871 Louisville Directory as a &quot;huckster&quot;. His descendants established the Discher Land Company and participated with Weigel in the development of Broadmeade and the present community of Seneca Gardens in 1922. Owing to Weigel&#x27;s mortgages, however, the 1929 stock market crash ruined him, and his share of the land fell to his creditors.

The Fidelity and Columbia Trust Company, which had constructed and maintained the roads and lighting system free of charge as part of its investment in the community, continued to do so until 1939, when it liquidated its interests in the community. Louisville had just commissioned a study suggesting that all-residential communities such as Seneca Gardens cost more in services than they provided in revenue, and Mayor Scholtz declined to annex the community. Instead, they petitioned the Jefferson Circuit Court (action #261,927) to incorporate the community on September 26 and met to form the first government on October 2. (The Commonwealth of Kentucky&#x27;s Land Office records the city as being incorporated in 1941.) The first city budget called for $1,600 in expenditures, requiring a property tax of 25¢ per $100 of assessed value.

Owing to the growing conflict in Europe, the U.S. Army established a large base at Bowman Field in 1940. Studies undertaken during its construction led the U.S. Surgeon General&#x27;s office to contact the City Board of Trustees to complain about the community&#x27;s sewage. At the time, the houses used separate septic tanks, but their functioning was greatly impaired by the area&#x27;s exposed and porous limestone. Sewage was draining into the city&#x27;s streams and ditches and running into Beargrass Creek, affecting the new army base. Preparations for the construction of a unified sewer were suspended by the entrance of the United States into World War II in late 1941, bringing in wartime rationing of men and materiel.

The city annexed some neighboring lots between Trevilian and Taylorsville roads and the area around Valletta in 1941. In 1943, some lots on the eastern side of Carolina Avenue, found to be half within Seneca Gardens and half within Louisville, opted to remove themselves to the latter by a vote of 23–3. The same year, the U.S. Army advised the city trustees that rationing no longer prevented construction of an improved sewer system, and locals approved a bond issue.

Louisville attempted to use the issue to demand annexation of the city, but a referendum in November 1944 clearly opposed that. The referendum was legally voided on technical grounds, but Louisville accepted the annexation would not occur. It permitted Seneca Gardens to connect to its system, but set a price that city trustees found excessive. It wasn&#x27;t until 1946 that a price was agreed upon and a second set of bonds issued to cover the expense and construction costs.

The same year, Cardinal Hill and two lots facing Seneca Park Road south of Trevilian were annexed. This left Seneca Gardens entirely surrounded as an enclave within Louisville after 1948, although the borders were not completely finalized until the 1950 annexation of the original Wetstein home and some lots along Valletta, including the Keneseth Israel Synagogue.

The municipal government has employed a City Arborist since 1990, who oversees tree planting and helps residents obtain trees at reduced prices.

<text>Shively is a home rule-class city in Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States, and a suburb of Louisville within the Louisville Metro government. As of the 2010 census, the city&#x27;s population was 15,264, reflecting an increase of 107 (+0.7%) from 15,157 in 2000.

==History==
===18th century===
After Louisville was founded at the Falls of the Ohio in 1778, farms spread out into the nearby countryside. Early landowners included Col. William Pope, Maj. Abner Field, and the Shivelys, Christian William and Jacob. Christian opened a mill and tavern on his tract near Mill Creek and the road connecting Louisville to the Salt River. (The road would later be incorporated as the Louisville and Nashville Turnpike.) The buildings became the focus of a settlement known as the &quot;Shively precinct&quot;.

===19th century===
In 1816, Christian donated the land for a church that is today known as Parkview Methodist.

A stagecoach stop was opened in 1831. The Elizabethtown and Paducah Railroad arrived in the 1870s.

Shortly before the Civil War, the area became popular among German immigrants, mostly from Bavaria. In 1897, they erected St. Helen&#x27;s Catholic Church. The community was commonly known as &quot;St. Helen&#x27;s&quot; for the next few years, but the post office (est. 1902) could not adopt it because there was another community with the name in Lee County.

===20th century===
A streetcar line was extended to the area in 1904.

Eight whiskey distilleries opened nearby after the end of Prohibition. When Louisville tried to annex and tax them during the Great Depression, the distillers talked the residents of Shively into incorporating separately (finalized May 23, 1938) and annexing their district instead. Their $20-million revenue stream left the small city well funded.

During the 1950s, it became the state&#x27;s fastest-growing city as white flight and suburbanization reached Louisville.

The area was long &quot;de facto&quot; segregated as a whites-only neighborhood. In 1954, black Korean War veteran and electrician Andrew Wade IV and his wife Charlotte, who had found themselves unable to buy a home in a suburban neighborhood due to Jim Crow housing discrimination, got help from activists Carl and Anne Braden. The Wades selected a house in Shively that they wanted to buy, and the Bradens bought it on their behalf and deeded it over to them. Soon afterwards, the Wades&#x27; home was repeatedly attacked—including cross burning on an adjacent lot, rocks through their windows, rifle shots into the house, and ultimately a dynamite bomb that exploded under their daughter&#x27;s bedroom while they were in the home (no one was injured). The news made national headlines. Anne Braden wrote a 1958 memoir, &quot;The Wall Between&quot;. No one was ever convicted of the crime. But the Bradens were charged with sedition for their actions. Carl Braden was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison; he spent seven months in jail before state-level sedition convictions were overturned by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in a related case in 1956. After the bombing, the Wades left and very few other blacks attempted to move in, and the community remained a largely white &quot;sundown town&quot; well into the 1960s. Since the 1970s, the black population has grown to about 30 percent, a greater percentage than in the Louisville metropolitan area as a whole, and more than double the percentage in the U.S. population as a whole.

Increased taxes and changing tastes closed most of Shively&#x27;s distilleries in the late 1960s. Shively&#x27;s population has gradually declined since reaching 19,223 in 1970. Budget surpluses became shortfalls, and Shively tried but failed to annex more suburban territory in Pleasure Ridge Park in 1984. The same year, the town was hit with a scandal when police chief Michael Donio admitted to taking bribes to allow prostitution in the area. Such events led to the community&#x27;s reputation as &quot;Lively Shively&quot; (as the name of the town is pronounced with a &quot;long i&quot;, this is a rhyme).

===21st century===
The area&#x27;s fortunes have since improved somewhat, with various public works projects occurring and some businesses moving to the area. However, the area along Seventh Street north of Dixie is still known for its seedy adult entertainment businesses. Into the 2000s, the area lagged behind eastern and southern Jefferson County, with one of its few remaining large retail centers, the Dillard&#x27;s on Dixie Highway (est. 1956), closing in 2007 due to slow sales at the location despite the chain&#x27;s general profitability in the Louisville area.

Shively remains the site of one major operating distillery: Brown-Forman&#x27;s Early Times distillery. Its products include Early Times, which was first produced in 1860, became one of the few brands that was allowed to be produced during the Prohibition era, and was the best-selling whiskey in the country in the mid-1950s. Another is Old Forester; first produced in 1870, it was the first bourbon sold exclusively in sealed bottles and is today the oldest continually produced brand. The former Stitzel-Weller distillery has been converted into a tourist attraction for the Bulleit Bourbon brand, and was included as a stop on the Kentucky Bourbon Trail in 2014. As of October 2014, the Michter&#x27;s bourbon brand was working on opening a new distillery in Shively. The Bernheim Distillery site, used by Heaven Hill Distilleries, opened in nearby Louisville around 2000.

On November 5, 2018, Democrat Beverly Chester Burton became the first African-American to be elected mayor of Shively.

==Geography==
Shively is centered on the junction of US 60 and the Dixie Highway (US 31W) near . Its modern boundaries are roughly Millers and Bernheim Lane to the north (Louisville&#x27;s Algonquin neighborhood); Louisville&#x27;s Seventh Street to the east; I-264 and St. Dennis to the west; and Rockford Lane and Pleasure Ridge Park to the south. Shively is southwest of downtown Louisville.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Shively has a total area of , of which , or 1.73%, are water.

<text>St. Matthews is a city in Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States. It forms part of the Louisville Metro government but is separately incorporated as a home rule-class city. The population was 17,472 at the 2010 census, up from 15,852 at the 2000 census. It is the 23rd-largest city in the state. St. Matthews is one of the state&#x27;s major shopping areas, home to the fifth-largest mall in Kentucky (Mall St. Matthews) along with many smaller shopping centers along Shelbyville Road.

==History==
Dating the arrival of American Indians to present-day Kentucky remains controversial, with estimates ranging from 40,000 to 10,000 years before the present. As with later European cultures, indigenous cultures were often divided near the falls of the Ohio River, which marked a transition zone in travel and settlement. During the late Woodland period ( century), this area was between the Ohioan Hopewell culture and the Illinois Crab Orchard culture that extended to the west. Later (), it was the boundary between the Mississippian and Fort Ancient cultures. During the 18th century, the area was claimed by various Indian tribes, including the Shawnee from the northwest and the Iroquois to the east; based in New York and Pennsylvania, the Iroquois used the Ohio Valley as a hunting ground by right of conquest.

The area eventually known as St. Matthews was first settled by European Americans in 1779 during the American Revolutionary War by Col. James John Floyd of Virginia. He had conducted an important survey of the Jefferson County area in 1774, and bought of land from Virginia and other colonial veterans who had been awarded the parcels for their service in the French and Indian War (known as the Seven Years&#x27; War in Europe). He arrived overland on November 8, 1779, bringing several family members and a black slave. They built cabins and a stockade, which came to be known as &quot;Floyd&#x27;s Station&quot;.

During the early 19th century, the area held several plantations and was known as the &quot;garden of the state&quot;. As with most areas of the Inner Bluegrass Region, the area was settled by many migrants from Virginia, who brought slaves for labor. The major crops were labor-intensive tobacco and hemp; breeding livestock, primarily horses, was also important to the economy. There were some changes to mixed crops because the soil was exhausted from tobacco. In the years before the Civil War, Kentucky planters had a surplus of slaves and sold many at markets in Louisville to traders who took them to the Deep South in the domestic slave trade. Demand was high as the South was being developed for sugar and especially cotton. The invention of the cotton gin had made cultivation of short-staple cotton profitable.

The St. Matthews community developed around the intersection of what are now Breckenridge Lane, Shelbyville Road, and Westport Road. By 1840, it was known as &quot;Gilman&#x27;s Point&quot;, after local tavern owner Daniel Gilman. The name &quot;St. Matthews&quot; was adopted in 1850 after the completion of St. Matthew&#x27;s Episcopal Church, the area&#x27;s first. It became the official name of the community in 1851 when the newly opened U.S. post office adopted it. Later numerous other Protestant churches were founded, including Baptist. Holy Trinity, the oldest of the three Catholic churches in the city, was completed in 1882, following immigration to the area of Catholics from Switzerland and Germany. Trinity High School was established nearby in association with the church.

St. Matthews was connected to the Louisville, Cincinnati and Lexington Railroad, as well as a later railroad that connected Louisville to Anchorage and Middletown. The railroad did not greatly alter the economy of St. Matthews, however, which remained heavily agricultural well into the 20th century.

In the early 20th century, it produced so many potatoes that it was a major center of the country for this crop. From 1910 to 1946, it was home to the St. Matthews Produce Exchange, which was once the second-largest potato shipper in the country. The area began changing in the early 20th century as a result of urban transit and automobile traffic. Gradually the farms were subdivided and developed as residential areas. The original landowners&#x27; names including Brown, Rudy, Nanz, Monohan, Oeschner, and Stich were used for local streets. The town&#x27;s first bank was founded in 1905. A modern shopping district began developing in the 1920s, to include the landmark Vogue Theater, opened in 1938.
Growth of the area was accelerated by the Ohio River flood of 1937, which caused many families to leave low-lying ground in Louisville and move to St. Matthews. It incorporated as a city in 1950, partially to address infrastructure problems and to build a sewer system. The Mall St. Matthews, Louisville&#x27;s first indoor shopping mall, opened around this time.

In 2001, St. Matthews annexed the cities of Broad Fields, Cherrywood Village, Fairmeade, Plymouth Village, and Springlee.

<text>Valley Station, Kentucky is a former census-designated place in southwestern Jefferson County, Kentucky, United States. The population was 22,946 at the 2000 census. When the government of Jefferson County merged with the city of Louisville, Kentucky in 2003, residents of Valley Station also became citizens of &quot;Louisville Metro&quot;.

==Government==

The Nicholasville government operates under a non-partisan city commission, which exercises both executive and legislative powers. The commission is composed of a mayor and four commissioners; all are elected at-large, requiring each candidate to gain the support of the majority of the electorate. In addition, the four commissioners are elected to manage particular city departments. They serve two-year terms; the mayor is elected to a four-year term. The commission wields all executive, legislative, and administrative powers.

In 2012, there was a proposal on the ballot to change the form of city government to that of a mayor–council government, in order to separate the legislative and executive functions, but the proposal was defeated.

Commissioners draft and pass laws and, by managing their respective departments, ensure the laws are carried out efficiently. The mayor administers oaths, signs documents on the city&#x27;s behalf, and conducts commission meetings. As a member of the commission, the mayor has legislative powers equal to that of the commissioners. Commission meetings take place twice monthly.

==Education==
Jessamine County Schools provides public education. Nicholasville Elementary School is located in the city. Students go to schools in the county for middle and high school grades.

The Hattie C. Warner Elementary School on Wilmore Road is named after local teacher Hattie Catherine Warner (1886–1963) who taught for 46 years in Jessamine County. She graduated from Eastern Kentucky University in 1913 and is buried in the Maple Grove cemetery.

<text>Paintsville () is a home rule-class city along Paint Creek in Johnson County, Kentucky, in the United States. It is the seat of its county. The population was 3,459 during the 2010 U.S. Census.

==History==
A Paint Lick Station was referred to in military dispatches as early as 1780. The site was named for Indian art painted on the debarked trees near a local salt lick when the first white settlers arrived and was originally part of a tract belonging to George Lewis. The trading post was purchased by the Carolinian Rev.Henery Dixon in 1812 and laid out as the town of Paint Lick Station in 1826. The town was formally established under that name in 1834, although the post office was probably named Paint Creek. It was incorporated as a city under its present name of Paintsville in 1843, the same year it became the seat of Johnson County.

The Civil War found Johnson County Fiscal Court passing an ordinance barring &quot;both&quot; Union and Confederate flags from being flown in its jurisdiction. This was quickly repealed when then-Col. James A. Garfield marched his brigade into the city.

During the early twentieth century, Paintsville began to transform into a modern American city. In 1902, the city&#x27;s first bank First National opened for business. In 1906, the city received telephone service and, two years later, all of its streets were paved. In 1912, Paintsville received electricity and natural gas services. In 1926, Paintsville residents received public water and the city&#x27;s fire department was established. Library services were originally provided through the Pack Horse Library Project.

Since the 1990s, Paintsville has seen a steady loss of population (4,345 in 1990 to 3,459 in 2010), in part due to a downturn in the economy, and the loss of coal jobs. Despite this, there have been some business developments in the past few years, as well as growing tourist interest. Paintsville has been in the process of revitalizing the downtown area to rejuvenate its original business district. On June 9, 2009, Paintsville became a &quot;wet&quot; city for the first time since March 14, 1945, permitting stores located within the city limits to sell alcoholic beverages.

===Cityscape===

Beginning in 1976, Paintsville&#x27;s main shopping district has gradually moved from Main Street to Mayo Plaza, which is northwest of downtown. Big-box retailers opened in the plaza during the early 1990s. This proved to be too much competition for the small family-owned businesses in downtown causing them to close. Today, downtown mostly serves as Paintsville&#x27;s financial district. In May 2009 Paintsville received a grant to redevelop Main Street in hopes of making it one of the city&#x27;s popular shopping districts again. In recent years, Mayo Plaza has rapidly expanded. In the early 2000s, a new Wal-Mart Supercenter, a new Lowe&#x27;s, and multiple restaurants opened.

<doc id="115276" wikidata="Q747599" url="?curid=115276" title="Covington, Kentucky">
<text>Covington is a home rule-class city in Kenton County, Kentucky, United States. Located at the confluence of the Ohio and Licking rivers, it lies south of Cincinnati, Ohio, across the Ohio and west of Newport, Kentucky, across the Licking. It had a population of 40,691 at the 2020 census, making it the largest city in Northern Kentucky and the fifth-most populous city in the state. A part of the Cincinnati metropolitan area, it is one of Kenton County&#x27;s two seats, along with Independence.
==History==
In 1814, John Gano, Richard Gano, and Thomas Carneal purchased The Point, of land on the west side of the Licking River at its confluence with the Ohio, from Thomas Kennedy for $50,000, and laid out the settlement of Covington the next year. It was named in honor of Gen. Leonard Covington, who was killed at the Battle of Crysler&#x27;s Farm during the War of 1812. The town was formally incorporated by the Kentucky General Assembly a year later and raised to city status in 1834.

The city prospered as an emporium for Kentucky&#x27;s tobacco and cigar production. In 1862, Stewart Iron Works was established; for a time, it was the largest iron fence maker in the world and still exists today as part of the Huseman Group of Cincinnati. There were also distilleries, glassworks, and stove factories. Like nearby Cincinnati, Covington&#x27;s factories and businesses were particularly staffed by Catholic and German immigrants. Its Catholic church was eventually raised to the level of a diocese.

In 1880, the city was named the center of the country&#x27;s population by the U.S. Census Bureau.

By 1900, Covington was the second-largest city and industrial region in Kentucky. At the time, its population of almost 43,000 was about 12% foreign-born and 5% Black. By this time, it was connected to the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and Louisville &amp; Nashville railways, and companies offered steamboat service to other ports on the Ohio River. Its factories had expanded to include cotton goods, machinery, and cordage.

Covington even boasted a Federal League baseball team, the Covington Blue Sox, during the 1913 season. The present-day circuit courthouse is located at the site of its former grounds, Federal Park, which is thought to have been the smallest stadium ever used by a professional baseball club.

It declined in importance during the Great Depression and the middle 20th century. The city has undergone some redevelopment during the late 20th and early 21st centuries as the most populous city in Kenton County.

==Geography==

The city is on the south bank of the Ohio River with Cincinnati, Ohio across the river to the north. The Licking River forms the eastern boundary with Newport in the adjacent Campbell County.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Covington has a total area of , of which is land and (3.88%) is covered by water.

===Neighborhoods===
Covington claims 19 distinct neighborhoods, ranging in population from several hundred to 10,000 people. Many of the neighborhoods are located in 12 historic districts that are predominantly found in the northern portion of the city, but Covington annexed many areas to the south in the late 20th and early 21st centuries to significantly enlarge its land area. Most of the neighborhoods have active resident associations or block watches that are dedicated to involving residents in strengthening their neighborhoods and improving safety, housing, and beautification.

===Climate===
Covington is located within a climatic transition zone; it is nestled within the southern end of the humid continental climate zone and the northern periphery of the humid subtropical climate of the Upland South, with hot, humid summers and cool winters. Evidence of both a humid subtropical and humid continental climate can be found here, particularly noticeable by the presence of plants indicative of each climatic region; for example, the southern magnolia &quot;(Magnolia grandiflora)&quot; from the subtropics and the blue spruce from cooler regions are successful landscape plants in and around Covington.

An act of the Kentucky General Assembly in 1834 incorporated Covington as a city, and in 1842, the City of Covington appointed its first &quot;Police Commissioner.&quot; Covington City Ordinance created the “Voluntary Night Watch&quot; in 1843, which consisted of seventy-one reputable persons invested with police authority. In 1856 a regular citizen&#x27;s police force was established. The department is staffed by 114 sworn officers, each assigned to one of 4 bureaus. There are substations, and a central headquarters. The department maintains accreditation through the Kentucky Association of Chiefs of Police as well as the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies.

<text>Independence is a home rule-class city in Kenton County, Kentucky, United States. It is one of its county&#x27;s two seats of government. The population was 28,676 at the time of the 2020 census. It is the third largest city in Northern Kentucky after Covington and Florence, and is part of the Cincinnati metropolitan area.

==History==

The area post office was established by Isaac Everett in 1837 as &quot;Everett&#x27;s Creek&quot;; in 1838, this was changed to &quot;Crews Creek&quot; (presumably after the present Cruises Creek that is south of the city); in 1839, Thomas Hordern renamed it &quot;Bagby&quot;.

In 1840, Kenton was formed from Campbell and Boone counties. Local farmer John McCollum donated a site at the center of the new county to be its seat of governance, and the name &quot;Independence&quot; was chosen to honor the liberation of locals from Campbell County. The post office was renamed the same year. Quickly settled, Independence was formally incorporated by the state assembly in 1842.

Because the majority of the county&#x27;s population resided along the Ohio River, Independence was eventually obliged to share its status as county seat with the larger city of Covington, a situation later repeated in Campbell County between the centrally-located Alexandria and the larger, riverside Newport.

==Geography==
Independence is located in central Kenton County. It is bordered to the northwest by Elsmere, to the north by Erlanger and Covington, and to the northeast by Ryland Heights. The western border of Independence follows the Boone County line, and the city of Florence in Boone County borders the far northwestern end of Independence.

The original center of Independence is in the southeast part of the city, along Madison Pike. Kentucky Route 17, a four-lane divided highway, passes just east of the city center, leading north to downtown Covington and south to Falmouth.

<doc id="115289" wikidata="Q2838594" url="?curid=115289" title="Ludlow, Kentucky">
<text>Ludlow is a home rule-class city in Kenton County, Kentucky, United States, along the Ohio River. The population was 4,385 at the 2020 census. It is a suburb of the Cincinnati metropolitan area. It received its greatest period of early growth as a rail station.

==History==

=== Early history ===
In 1790, the land that is now Ludlow was given to Gen. Thomas Sandford as a grant in recognition of his service during the Revolutionary War. Sandford traded the land to Thomas D. Carneal for land in what is now Ft. Mitchell. Carneal had Elmwood Hall built on the riverfront in 1818. It still stands (as of 2011) at 244 Forest Avenue and is a private residence. Carneal later sold the land to William Bullock, a British showman, entrepreneur, and traveller, who directed John Papworth to design a utopian community for the site named &quot;Hygeia&quot; (Greek for &quot;health&quot;). Never realizing this plan, Bullock sold the land to Israel L. Ludlow in 1830. Ludlow was platted as a town in 1846. The city of Ludlow, named for the landowner, was incorporated in 1864.

As the Cincinnati Southern Railroad (Queen and Crescent Route) arrived in the 1870s, many people were enticed by Ludlow. Because of the adequate amount of railroad jobs, many people - mostly German and Irish - began moving to Ludlow. In the 1890s, a streetcar service, provided by The Green Line, also sparked popularity.

=== The Ludlow Lagoon ===

==== Construction and early success ====
Around the Bromley, Kentucky border, which is on the western edge of Ludlow, construction of a lake was started in 1894 by The Green Line streetcar company. The Green Line wanted an amusement park at the end of the Ludlow streetcar line. The lake, which was 85-acres and featured five islands, opened in 1895. It was originally used for fishing and boating. Additional attractions included a clubhouse used for dining, and a dance pavilion that hosted many orchestras and other music groups that were popular during the Jazz Age.

As time progressed, the Lagoon began to add many classic amusement park rides. The most popular was the Scenic Railway, which rode across the lake. It was designed by LaMarcus Thompson, who also designed the Scenic Railway at Coney Island in New York. Other attractions which contributed to the Lagoon&#x27;s success were an amphitheater, a movie theatre, a vaudeville stage, and a Japanese-themed fair. The park also featured many walking trails, games, acrobats, and other performers. The park was receiving thousands of visitors each day by the early 1900s. The Ludlow Motordrome, which was opened on July 21, 1913, attracted large crowds. It was a motorcycle racetrack that could seat 8,000 spectators.

==== Damaging disasters ====
Just before the motordrome was built, the Great Flood of 1913 swept through Ludlow, damaging many attractions. Just nine days after the motordrome&#x27;s opening on July 30, 1913, tragedy struck Ludlow once again. A driver lost control of his motorcycle during a race. The cycle crashed into a gas lamp, and set fire to the stands which killed at least ten people and injured over one-hundred people out of the 5,000 spectators present. Two years later, a tornado struck Ludlow in July 1915, which damaged many buildings and attractions of the Lagoon, causing $20,000 ($615,000 adjusted for 2024 inflation) in damage. The final blow of the Lagoon occurred as a result of World War I. Grain was needed for the war effort, so the U.S. Government restricted the amount of beer that was able to be produced. As a result, the Lagoon took a heavy blow because it sold local beer throughout the park. The Ludlow Lagoon ended its operations after the 1917 season. Since its closing, the lake has been filled in, and all attractions have been destroyed. Except for the clubhouse, which still stands at 312 Lake St.

=== Post World War I – present ===
After World War I, Ludlow experienced a time of growth subsequent to the shutdown of the Lagoon. On the east side of town, the Morningside neighborhood was annexed. On the west side of town, the area of the defunct Ludlow Lagoon was being redeveloped. Ludlow also experienced success after World War II. The Baby Boom increased the population to 6,374 by 1950 which filled churches and schools. The increased population also resulted in the development of the Ludlow Heights. However, in the 1960s, the population began to decline and has been declining ever since. In recent years, Ludlow has made minor developments, especially to its housing.

Others then moved onto the land, felling trees for lumber and clearing land for farming, which began the settling of the city of Taylor Mill.

In 1959 Taylor Mill annexed the former city of Sunny Acres, because its name confused newcomers who associated it with the fictional setting of an episode (&quot;Shady Deal at Sunny Acres&quot;) from the popular TV series &quot;Maverick&quot;.

<text>Hodgenville is a home rule-class city in LaRue County, Kentucky, United States. It is the seat of its county. Hodgenville sits along the North Fork of the Nolin River. The population was 3,206 at the 2010 census. It is included in the Elizabethtown metropolitan area.

==History==

Robert Hodgen, a Pennsylvania native who moved to Virginia, purchased of land in the vicinity. In 1789, after the Revolutionary War, when settlers started moving west into Kentucky, he built a mill at the site. After his death, the community that developed around it was called &quot;Hodgenville&quot; upon the petition of his widow and children. The United States post office at the site, however, was known as &quot;Hodgensville&quot; from 1826 to 1904.

The city was formally incorporated by the state assembly on February 18, 1836.

===Abraham Lincoln birthplace===

Abraham Lincoln was born in a small cabin on Sinking Spring Farm near Hodgenville on February 12, 1809. About two years later, the family moved to another farm in the Hodgenville area. Despite claims made later, the cabin Lincoln was born in was likely destroyed by the time of his assassination.

The Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historical Park labels the replica cabin, which was built thirty years after his death, the &quot;Traditional Lincoln Birthplace Cabin&quot;. The significance of the two Hodgenville sites (birthplace and boyhood home) are found in the setting. Preservation of these two national sites allows visitors to see the landscape of the earliest period of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s life. The Lincoln Museum is opened for visitors downtown, and two bronze Abraham Lincoln statues stand at the town square, one of Lincoln as a child, the other as an adult.

<text>Louisa is a home-rule class city located in eastern Kentucky, United States, at the merger of the Levisa and Tug Forks into the Big Sandy River, which forms part of the state&#x27;s border with West Virginia. It is the seat of Lawrence County. The population was 2,467 at the 2010 census and an estimated 2,375 in 2018.

==History==
The origin of the city&#x27;s name is unclear. Theories include that it was named for Louisa County, Virginia, after Louisa Swetnam, one of the first white children born in the area, or after a corruption of the original name of the Levisa Fork, as it was originally written and spoken as the &quot;Louisa Fork.&quot; An 1856 map still shows the river under the name &quot;Louisa.&quot; Virginia, Carolina and other English colonial-linked settlement attempts began as early as 1790 but did not take hold until 1818. Louisa became the county seat in 1822 and a city in 1823.

About 1792, Vancouver&#x27;s Station, which had been destroyed by the Native Americans in 1790, on the tongue of land between the Levisa and Tug Forks of the Big Sandy, was reestablished. A few years later this settlement was known as &quot;Balclutha&quot; and is so designated on early maps of the state.

During the Civil War, Union troops under future president James A. Garfield occupied the city from December 1861 until the end of the war, despite several Confederate takeover attempts.
The Chattaroi Railroad (now a part of CSX) connected to Louisa in 1881. The city is also served by US 23.

The &quot;Big Sandy News&quot;, headquartered in Louisa, profiled the town in March 1888.

The first needle dam constructed in the United States was completed just north of town in 1896.

==Geography==
Louisa&#x27;s eastern border is the Levisa Fork, and its northern border is the Big Sandy River, which also serves as the Kentucky–West Virginia border.

U.S. Route 23 passes through the western side of the city, leading north down the valley of the Big Sandy River to Ashland on the Ohio River and southwest to Staffordsville. Kentucky Route 3 passes through the center of Louisa on Madison Street; KY 3 leads northwest to Fallsburg and southeast up the valley of the Tug Fork and Rockcastle Creek to Inez. Kentucky Route 32 leads southwest from Louisa to Blaine. West Virginia Route 37 leads east across the Tug Fork to Fort Gay, West Virginia.

According to the United States Census Bureau, Louisa has a total area of , of which , or 0.81%, are water.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Louisa has a Humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Points of interest==
The bridge from Louisa, Kentucky to Fort Gay, West Virginia, is a rare multi-way T-bridge. The quarter-mile concrete span crosses two forks of the Big Sandy River, connects two states, and has a right turn at its halfway point to connect traffic to the Point Section neighborhood of Louisa. The current concrete and steel structure was constructed in 1979 and retrofitted in 2003.

&quot;The Paveillon&quot; (or more commonly known as &quot;The Birdhouse&quot;) is a five story tall spire structure that serves as a gas station, rest stop, and a country music museum along U.S. Route 23 as it passes through the western side of the city. The structure was inspired by the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego, California and the Grand Floridian Resort in Orlando, Florida.

The Fred M. Vinson Birthplace is the historical boyhood home of the 13th Chief Justice of the United States, and the first jail to be built in Lawrence County. It is located on the corner of Madison St. and Vinson Ave. The grave of Chief Justice Vinson can also be found at Pinehill Cemetery.

The town, having suffered during the opioid crisis, became a center for recovery and rehabilitation.
==Culture==
Every second weekend in September, Louisa hosts the regional Septemberfest that features several local and national acts performing for three days, as well as arts and crafts on the northwestern side of town, and the many food vendors featuring Southeastern cuisine.

The Lee County Board of Education has announced plans to close Beattyville Elementary and transfer the students to Southside Elementary. To accommodate the influx of students, an expansion of the facilities at Southside will be required. The decision was not popular with residents of the community The Board of Education exhausted its bonding capacity to fund the addition to Southside, so it proposed a tax increase in 2013 to fund other repairs at other facilities. Residents of the county signed a petition to place the tax increase on the ballot. The school board decided to delay the implementation of the tax until 2014 so as not to have to pay approximately $20,000 to fund a special election. The school board passed the tax in 2014 and again, a petition was filed placing the matter on the ballot for the fall 2014 general election.

Vermont prisoners rioted in 2004 and were joined by Kentucky prisoners. Kentucky removed its last inmates in 2010, and ended its contract with a CCA in 2013. Vermont removed its inmates in 2015.

==Woolly Worm Festival==

Since 1988, during the third weekend after the first Monday of October, the Main Street of Beattyville is closed to traffic for the annual Woolly Worm Festival. It operates for three days: Friday-&quot;Opening Day&quot;, Saturday-&quot;Parade Day&quot;, and Sunday-&quot;Closing Day&quot; (which also features a large car show).

The name &quot;woolly worm&quot; refers to the woolly bear caterpillar. The official mascot, &quot;Woolly the Woolly Worm&quot;, is used as an image on some local merchandise and flyers. A round hay bale caricature of him stands beside the welcome sign to Beattyville. The festival is the outgrowth of a series of stories by Beattyville native Rosemary Kilduff (wife of Malcolm Kilduff) that tracked the predictions of winter weather based on local folklore. The severity of upcoming winter weather was said to be foretold by the relative proportions of black to brown coloration of the caterpillars. Kilduff penned columns in the local newspaper in the 1980s that collected woolly worm sightings by local residents.

During the festival, numerous musicians perform almost constantly on one of two stages, and dozens of booths offer a wide variety of merchandise and food. Helicopter tours of Beattyville and Lee County are available. The &quot;Woolly Worm Races&quot; are won by coaxing one of these &quot;Hairy Caterpillars&quot; to the top of a string. The first one to reach the top wins, with the only rule being &quot;No Touching&quot;; there is usually a cash prize for the winner.

The Woolly Worm Festival continues as a popular event attracting numerous tourists. Beattyville is a few minutes from Natural Bridge State Resort Park, another tourist destination.
