<text>Andover is a city in Anoka County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 32,601 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. County Roads 9, 18, 78, and 116 are the main routes in the community. U.S. Highway 10 is nearby.

Crooked Lake is the only fully recreational lake in Andover. It is on the southern border of the city with the majority of the lake in neighboring Coon Rapids.

==History==
Andover first organized in 1857 as Round Lake Township.

In 1860 after an Anoka, Minnesota speech by U.S. Representative Galusha Aaron Grow from Pennsylvania who was an abolitionist and a major figure in the Homestead Act, the town name was changed to Grow Township.

Ham Lake Township split from Andover, known as Grow Township at the time, in 1871.

Once a stop on the Great Northern Railway, Andover was established as a city in 1976.

A popular myth surrounding the origins of the name &quot;Andover&quot; describe a train tipping off the railroad tracks, and an eyewitness describing that the train &quot;went over and over&quot;, however this proves to be false because an Anoka County Union Newspaper article first mentions the name in an articled dated March 14, 1899, before any railroad tracks went through the city. The article described the Great Northern Railway announcing the names of new stations being located throughout the area, including a station named &quot;Andover Station&quot;. The origin of the name for the station is unknown.

<text>Anoka ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Anoka County, Minnesota, United States. Its population was 17,142 at the 2010 census. Anoka is the
&quot;Halloween Capital of the World&quot; because it hosted one of the first Halloween parades in 1920. It continues to celebrate the holiday each year with several parades. Anoka is a northern suburb of the Twin Cities. U.S. Highways 10 / 169 and State Highway 47 are three of Anoka&#x27;s main routes, and it has a station on the Northstar Commuter Rail line to Minneapolis.

==History==
Colonists first settled the site that is now Anoka in 1844. By the mid-1850s, Anoka had a school, a store and a flour mill. In 1856, C. C. Andrews called it a &quot;large and handsome village&quot; and noted that pine logs were floated down the Rum River to sawmills there. The city was formally incorporated in 1878. The name &quot;Anoka&quot; was possibly derived from two Indian words. Santee Dakota used &quot;anoka&quot;, meaning &quot;on both sides&quot; or &quot;from both sides&quot;, referring to its location on both banks of the Rum River. Ojibwe used , meaning &quot;I work&quot;, referring to the town&#x27;s busy local lumber sites.
Anoka has a strong claim to having provided the first Union Army volunteers during the Civil War, as noted by a small plaque at the corner of West Main Street and Park Street. Alexander Ramsey, Minnesota&#x27;s governor in 1861, was in Washington, D.C. when Fort Sumter was fired upon. He immediately offered a regiment to the War Department, and telegraphed former governor Willis Gorman and Lieutenant Governor Ignatius L. Donnelly that morning. Gorman, attending a district court session in Anoka, received the note by messenger from St. Paul and called a court recess, asking for volunteers. Aaron Greenwald, who has an &quot;island&quot; named after him on Lake George, and five others stepped forward; Greenwald was the first to sign. He died on July 5, 1863, after sustaining a mortal wound as a member of the 1st Minnesota Regiment in defense against Pickett&#x27;s Charge at the Battle of Gettysburg.

==Geography==
Anoka lies at the confluence of the Rum and Mississippi Rivers, approximately 20 miles (30Â km) northwest of Minneapolis. According to the United States Census Bureau, it has an area of , of which is land and is water. Adjacent communities include Dayton, Ramsey, Andover, Coon Rapids, and Champlin. The USGS tracks the city by the ID 639396 and the coordinates of 
45Â°11â²52â³N, 093Â°23â²14â³W.

The name originated from an unincorporated community named &quot;Nowthen&quot; near the intersection of County Roads 5 and 22 within the former township. &quot;Nowthen&quot; was coined by the town&#x27;s first postmaster, James Hare, who had the habit of saying &quot;Now, then&quot; in conversation.

==Law enforcement==
Historically the community did not have its own law enforcement agency and instead relied on the Anoka County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. In 2011, the Sheriffâs Office asked the city to pay for non-emergency law enforcement services. The city council voted 3â2 to not do this, which led to the city only having emergency law enforcement as it chose not to establish its own police force. The department&#x27;s request would have meant a 27% increase in property taxes.

===First responders===
Nowthen built their first fire department in 2021. Ramsey wanted to charge Nowthen about $160,000 in administrative costs, the mayor thought that was too high. Nowthen will take a fire engine, tanker, rescue rig, hoses and other equipment from Ramsey and they also gain a fire station that they can now use. They will pay the city of St. Francis about $75,000 a year for the next three years to have the assistance chief, Dave Schmidt, oversee the startup and head the department.

They currently have 12 members working for the Fire Department, and are expecting eight more to join.

<text>Columbia Heights is a city in Anoka County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 21,973 at the 2020 census.

Minnesota State Highways 47 (University Avenue) and 65 (Central Avenue) are two of the main routes in the city.

Columbia Heights is a first-ring northern suburb of Minneapolis, which borders it on the south. Its downtown district is centered at the intersection of 40th Avenue NE and Central Avenue, and includes the Heights Theater, county offices, the Public Library, and a variety of businesses. Central Avenue forms a commercial district along its length. More businesses also line University Avenue.

==Geography==

Columbia Heights is bordered by the city of Fridley to the north and west; New Brighton and Saint Anthony to the east; and Minneapolis to the south.

The city of Hilltop is entirely enclosed within the city.

Columbia Heights has a hilly terrain and features one of the highest points in Hennepin, Ramsey, and Anoka Counties along Stinson Boulevard between Fairway Drive and 45th Avenue NE/County Road E. There are five lakes in the city, which include Sullivan Lake, Highland Lake, Silver Lake, Hart Lake, and LaBelle Pond.

The city park system resides in mostly low lying and former swampland areas that was unsuitable for building. Huset Park is the main park in the city. Prestemon, Gauvitte and McKenna Parks were all named for members of the first city council in 1921. Ava Ostrander, first woman elected to the council in 1924, also has a park named for her. Kordiak Park is an Anoka County park in the city named after former County Commissioner Albert A. Kordiak. Other parks include Edgemoor, La Belle, Lomianki, Keyes, Sullivan, Ramsdell, and Hilltop.

==History==
Columbia Heights was formed as a village on March 14, 1898, when it separated from the former Fridley Township. On July 21, 1921, the Charter of the City of Columbia Heights was adopted and the city was formed.

A Polish flag and white eagle are on the sign marking the border between Columbia Heights and Minneapolis, visible when entering Columbia Heights on Central Avenue, in celebration of the suburb&#x27;s early roots as a PolishâAmerican community. In 1991, Columbia Heights joined Sister Cities International and selected Åomianki, Poland as its Sister City. In 1944, a plane of Allied flyers was shot down during the Warsaw uprising, near Åomianki. The brother of a long time Columbia Heights resident was on that mission. In 1987, the people of Åomianki erected a monument in memory of the American flyers who lost their lives. Because of this personal connection Åomianki was selected as the Sister City.

Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s funeral car was bought by Thomas Lowry who restored it and featured it at a number of exhibitions throughout the country. When not in use, it was stored in Columbia Heights but was destroyed by a fire on March 18, 1911.

In 2016, Columbia Heights was honored with the All-American City Award according to the National Civic League.

==History==
Linwood Township split from Bethel Township in 1871.

East Bethel was incorporated as a village on June 7, 1957, and was incorporated as the city of East Bethel on January 1, 1974.

The current boundaries of the City of East Bethel belonged to the Chippewa Indians until 1837, when the United States bought their lands east of the Mississippi River in what was later to become the State of Minnesota. Settlers began arriving in the area in the 1850s and the area was incorporated as a Township in 1858, the same year Minnesota was admitted to the Union. The Township was originally incorporated as the Township of Bethel, the name derived from the Bible and meaning the &quot;House of God.&quot;

Situated in the northeast portion of Anoka County, the Quakers were the first settlers in Bethel in 1856. The group quickly established a school and a church, but left the area following the Indian Massacre of 1862. The Quakers took their families to Anoka and Minneapolis and never returned to the area. Other settlers that left during the Indian Wars did return to the area and became farmers, tradesmen, and merchants. The Township of Bethel exhibited a slow but steady growth from 423 in 1880 to 1,286 in 1957.

In spring of 1957, a local committee was formed to take the necessary legal steps to incorporate. On May 3, 1957, the petition was presented to the Anoka County Board of Commissioners and, as a result of the required election, incorporation was approved by 232 to 161 vote. This vote was challenged and the matter eventually was sent to the Minnesota Supreme Court and finally to the State Legislature for validation. East Bethel was officially incorporated as a Village on April 27, 1959 and as a City on January 1, 1974.

The City is approximately 48 square miles, which makes it the third largest City in the metro area in terms of size.

<text>Fridley is a city in Anoka County, Minnesota, United States. Its population was 29,590 at the 2020 census. It was first settled as a place named Manomin where Rice Creek flows into the Mississippi river and the Red River Oxcart trail crosses the creek. Fridley was incorporated in 1949 as a village and became a city in 1957. It is part of the MinneapolisâSaint Paul metropolitan area as a northern &quot;first-ring&quot; or &quot;inner-ring&quot; suburb. Most of the growth in Fridley occurred between 1950 and 1970. Fridley borders Minneapolis to the southwest. Neighboring first-ring suburbs are Columbia Heights to the south and Brooklyn Center to the west, across the Mississippi River.

==Geography and climate==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which are land and is covered by water.

The city lies within a narrow portion of the southernmost part of Anoka County. It is longer northâsouth along the path of the Mississippi River, and the highways that follow the river. It is narrower east/west in the portion between the Mississippi River and Spring Lake Park.

Fridley borders the cities of Coon Rapids and Blaine to the north; Spring Lake Park to the northeast; Mounds View and New Brighton to the east; Columbia Heights to the southeast; Minneapolis to the southwest; and Brooklyn Park and Brooklyn Center to the west.

Fridley is at the southern edge of the Anoka Sand Plain. Lakes in Fridley include East Moore Lake, West Moore Lake, and Locke Lake. Rice Creek flows through the central part of the city, Springbrook Creek through the northwest section, and the Mississippi River borders Fridley to the west. Parts of islands in the Mississippi River, including the Islands of Peace and Banfill Island, are within the city.

===Climate===
Fridley shares its climate with nearby Minneapolis. It has a hot-summer humid continental climate zone (&quot;Dfa&quot; in the KÃ¶ppen climate classification), typical of southern parts of the Upper Midwest, and is situated in USDA plant hardiness zone 4b. As is typical in a continental climate, the difference between average temperatures in the coldest winter month and the warmest summer month is great: .

==History==

===19th century===
Fridley&#x27;s post-European/American settlement history began with the construction of the Red River Trails Woods trail for the Red River ox carts in 1844. The trail traveled through Minnesota Territory from St. Paul to Pembina in present-day North Dakota. It was used to transport furs to the south and other supplies to Red River Valley settlers in the north. The East River Road (Anoka County Highway 1) follows this route today within Fridley, from the border with Minneapolis to the border with Coon Rapids. 
In 1847, John Banfill became the first settler in the township area, which was known at the time as Manomin. Manomin is a variant spelling of &quot;manoomin&quot;, the Ojibwe word for wild rice, a staple of their diet. It comprised the modern-day municipalities of Columbia Heights, Fridley, Hilltop, and Spring Lake Park. The Banfill Tavern was built in 1847.

The area soon grew quickly in size. In 1851, Banfill platted the actual town of Manomin. There, a general store and sawmill were built next to Rice Creek, named after Henry Mower Rice, a settler who two years earlier had acquired land in the area. In 1853, the first town post office was in operation, and a year later, a ferry crossing the Mississippi River was established.

In 1855, Abram M. Fridley, for whom the city is named, was elected as the first territorial representative for the area.

In 1857, the area separated from Ramsey County; Manomin County was established, and it became the smallest county in the nation, with only 18 sections. This distinction was short-lived; it was annexed by Anoka County in 1870 and became a township with the same name.

The Saint Paul and Pacific Railroad, which joined St. Paul to St. Anthony across from Minneapolis in 1862, began extending rail to Anoka, reaching it through Fridley in 1864.

In 1879, the Minnesota Legislature, of which Abram Fridley was still a member, changed the township&#x27;s name to bear his name.

===20th century===
In 1949, Fridley Township voted to be incorporated as the Village of Fridley. The &quot;Fridley Free Press&quot; was also established. Northern Pump, whose factory was within the village&#x27;s boundaries, sued to challenged the village&#x27;s incorporation. This caused the village funds to be frozen. Minnesota state law allowed cities to operate municipal liquor stores after Prohibition ended. Fridley&#x27;s liquor store proceeds were the primary funding for daily city operations until the lawsuit was resolved in 1950. Minnesota has both private liquor stores and city-owned municipal liquor stores. Fridley is the location of the headquarters of the Minnesota Municipal Beverage Association (MMBA), a lobbying coalition for municipalities with city-owned liquor stores. In conjunction with the Minnesota Licensed Beverage Association, it lobbied against Sunday liquor store sales in Minnesota until they were finally permitted in 2017.

The Totino&#x27;s frozen pizza company opened a factory in Fridley in 1970 as it was growing to a national business. The business was sold to Pillsbury in 1975.

====Growth====
In 1957, the village became the City of Fridley, a &quot;home rule charter city&quot;. City Hall, at 6431 University Avenue Northeast, has a fire station, city services and council meetings. A newer fire station was built in 1964. Fridley&#x27;s population grew past 15,000 in the 1950s and peaked over 30,000 by the 1970s.

====1965 flood and tornadoes====
Two of Fridley&#x27;s worst disasters happened within weeks of each other. In April 1965, Minnesota was affected by a &quot;500-year flood&quot;. The spring flood on the Upper Mississippi is still the flood of record for from about 100 miles north of Minneapolis to Hannibal, Missouri. The crests that April exceeded previous records by several feet at many river gauge sites. Those crests still exceed the second-highest crest by a foot or more at many of those sites. An ice jam rising 24 feet over the river broke up when it rammed a series of ice breakers above the Sartell Dam. The Riverview Heights area where Springbrook creek enters the river was severely flooded.

On May 6, 1965, Fridley was hit by two F4 tornadoes. One of every four homes in the city was destroyed or damaged. The second twister to hit was the deadliest storm in Twin Cities history, killing 13 people. Parts of City Hall and the fire station were damaged.

====Post disaster recovery====
In 1967, a new Civic Center Building opened at the City Hall location, with a plaza to the south. This building was remodeled in 1989 and demolished in 2019. The acreage around 73rd and (old) Central was purchased by growing Minneapolis-originated companies, Medtronic, Inc. and Onan Corporation, for manufacturing facilities.

====Springbrook Nature Center and tornado====
In 1970, Fridley began purchasing land that became the Springbrook Nature Center. On July 18, 1986, a widely photographed tornado spent 16 minutes in Springbrook Nature Center, destroying thousands of century-old trees and extensive areas of mature forest habitat. Well-known aerial footage of the tornado was filmed by a KARE 11 television news helicopter passing through the area.

===21st century===
In 2001, Medtronic opened its new World Headquarters on the site of the 100 Twin Drive-in at Interstate 694 and Minnesota Highway 65. As of 2019, it is still the Operational Headquarters for Medtronic, PLC, which reorganized as an Irish company in 2015.

On June 19, 2003, President George W. Bush visited the Micro Controls company in Fridley. He was promoting one of the tax relief changes made during his administration.

In the early 2000s, the Minnesota Sports Cafe was a notable venue for mixed martial arts competitions. Fighters who have claimed victories in Fridley include Sean Sherk, Nick Thompson, Brock Larson, Marcus LeVesseur, Brian Ebersole, and Harry Moskowitz.

On September 21, 2005, Fridley was struck by straight-line winds exceeding , toppling many old growth trees as large as in diameter and destroying dozens of homes and several vehicles. Cleanup efforts took a week, leaving hundreds of residents stranded in their homes without power, unable to drive until streets were cleared of debris. The storm also affected Brooklyn Center, New Brighton, Brooklyn Park, Coon Rapids, Spring Lake Park, Blaine, and other communities in the surrounding North Metro area.

Fridley has one of the first six stations of the Northstar Commuter Rail line connecting the northwest suburbs and downtown Minneapolis; the line opened in November 2009.

On July 17, 2011, heavy rains washed out the BNSF rail bridge over Rice Creek. A train derailed there and sent hopper cars containing corn into the creek. Traffic was rerouted for several days. In 2013, a jury awarded damages from BNSF to the train&#x27;s engineer and conductor.

The Columbia Arena, filming location for the Disney Movie D3: The Mighty Ducks, was demolished in 2016 to make way for a new City Hall. This was controversial because it was expected to cost $50 million and increase homeowner taxes by 19%. The Fridley Civic Campus dedication at 7071 University Avenue NE was held on November 17, 2018. The staff had moved from the previous city hall over Veteran&#x27;s Day weekend and began working there on November 12. The city council approved the project in December 2016 after nearly three years of studies, meetings and workshops. The council raised the levy to pay for the project, increasing city taxes about 16% for the average homeowner. A number of other Twin Cities suburbs updated their civic facilities during a 2018 &quot;building boom of sorts&quot;, including Eagan, New Hope, Minnetonka, and Burnsville.

Fridley received an allocation of $1.52 million from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA). The money was used to upgrade and repair its water distribution system and wastewater and storm water infrastructure. The city plans in 2022 to use the next allocation of $1.52 million to improve security at water treatment plants, rebuild its water distribution system, and on sanitary sewer and water quality projects.

President Joe Biden visited the Cummins plant in Fridley on April 3, 2022, as part of his &quot;Investing in America&quot; tour. Cummins had announced a $1 billion initiative to produce clean energy technology, including electrolyzers for hydrogen cells in Fridley.

==Economy==
Fridley is home to the Operational (formerly World) Headquarters of Ireland-based Medtronic plc. Medtronic also has a substantial Rice Creek business campus. Other major employers in Fridley include BAE Systems (formerly United Defense), Cummins, Unity Medical Center, part of the Allina Healthcare system, part of the Mercy Hospitals, Minco Products, Inc, and Kurt Manufacturing Company. Fridley is also home to a Target Stores retail distribution center. Magnum Research, a company that produces the Desert Eagle firearm, had its headquarters in Fridley until 2010.

Minneapolis and Saint Paul draw their municipal water supplies from the Mississippi River at Fridley, which is upstream. The City of Minneapolis Waterworks plant and Fire Department training facility are in Fridley.

In the 2000 census data, there were 11,542 more jobs in Fridley than the number of workers age 16 and over. But most Fridley residents work outside Fridley, most commonly in other cities in Hennepin County and in Minneapolis. Only 21% of the 15,221 Fridley residents in the workforce in 2000 worked in Fridley. Fridley saw a decline in the number of jobs from 26,763 in 2000 to 23,845 in 2006, according to the city economic plan report.

===Largest employers===
According to the City&#x27;s 2021 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the largest employers in the city are:

==Education==

Fridley&#x27;s public schools are governed by Fridley Independent School District 14. Fridley High School, Fridley Middle School, Hayes Elementary School, and Stevenson Elementary School comprise the district. In 1978, Fridley closed three elementary schools due to declining enrollment: Gardena, Riverwood, and Parkview. Riverwood Elementary was demolished and single-family homes were developed. Parkview Elementary became the Fridley Community Center. Gardena Elementary became the Al-Amal School. Rice Creek Elementary closed later and was demolished, with single-family homes developed in its place. After the 1965 tornado, students at Parkview had to double up at the Riverwood school while it was being rebuilt.

Totino-Grace High School, a private Roman Catholic high school, Calvin Christian High School, a private Christian high school, and Al-Amal School, a private Islamic K-12 school, are also in Fridley.

A small part of northern Fridley is in Anoka-Hennepin School District 11. Students living in an area of eastern Fridley are in Columbia Heights School District 13. North Park Elementary is in Fridley. Most students living in north-northeastern Fridley are in Spring Lake Park School District 16. A District 16 elementary school, Woodcrest Spanish Immersion, is in Fridley.

==Transportation==
Minnesota State Highway 65 serves as a main route in the city.

==History==
The earliest record of settlers in the Ham Lake area goes back to 1855, and in 1856, settlers established a town just south and west of a lake shaped like a ham. The settlers platted and sold lots for a community they named &quot;Glen Carey&quot;, a Scottish name meaning &quot;beautiful valley&quot;. The location was widely advertised as a future city. In 1857, all the houses were destroyed by a prairie fire. Some of the inhabitants barely escaped with their lives, saving only a few household goods. The settlers soon left the area as they had nowhere to live.

There was no more settlement until 1866, when a Norwegian man settled in the area. He was soon followed by other Scandinavians. The Scandinavian settlers found it difficult to pronounce &quot;Glen Carey&quot;. Since no official name had been chosen by the people, the commissioners named it Ham Lake.

Early settlers found the soil well-suited to farming as it was not as rocky as Scandinavia&#x27;s. Dairying became an important industry. The pioneer farmers soon found the soil suited to growing potatoes and this became an important commodity for both cash sales and trading. Ham Lake Township split from Grow Township (Andover) in 1871. In 1872, immigrants built the Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Church.

From the early 1900s through the 1930s, potato farming was at its peak in what was then Ham Lake Township. Some of the farms remaining today are the sod farms in southeastern Ham Lake, where the ground is low and the soil black and heavy, making it well suited to this crop, as well as corn and potatoes in some places.

In 1894, when the population was over 400, a group of farmers formed a cooperative and built a creamery. Several general stores were built there shortly afterward. What became the main store in town, Soderquist&#x27;s, was built on land sold to the Soderquist family by the Olson family, who had extensive landholdings along what later became Highway 65. As in many small American communities, over time all the &quot;old&quot; families became related through marriage. Although many of the establishing families have since moved out of Ham Lake due to increasing property taxes and crowding, these familial connections remain, and many members of the families are still in close contact.

In 1922, a service garage opened in northern Ham Lake.

A Fire Department was established in 1969, with Eldon Hentges as the first fire chief.

Ham Lake officially became a city on January 8, 1974, with Hentges serving as the first mayor.

<doc id="119370" wikidata="Q2230839" url="?curid=119370" title="Hilltop, Minnesota">
<text>Hilltop is a city in Anoka County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 958 at the 2020 census.

The city is a small enclave within the city of Columbia Heights and consists of 16 city blocks. Minnesota State Highway 65 (Central Avenue) serves as a main route, running on the town&#x27;s eastern edge.

The majority of the town&#x27;s residents live in the 263 mobile homes, across four trailer parks, that sit within the city&#x27;s borders. Hilltop is one of only two incorporated cities in Minnesota that consist primarily of manufactured housing; the second is another Twin Cities suburb, Landfall.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

Hilltop is an enclave within Columbia Heights.

==History==
The land where Hilltop exists was originally an unincorporated part of the former Fridley Township, a civil township next to the city of Fridley. The land had a dairy farm and later was the Oak Grove Riding Academy and Stables. The first trailer park, Trailer City, opened on the land in the 1940s; another park, Sunnyside, soon opened next door. Residents of two trailer parks became concerned that the township was planning to remove the mobile homes. In 1956, led by Trailer City Park owner Les Johnson, they approached neighboring Columbia Heights and requested to be annexed by the city. Columbia Heights turned down their request, so Johnson circulated a petition to have the residents vote on incorporation. The petition for incorporation passed smoothly, 137 to 34, and Hilltop was created. The city was named after a nearby drive-in cinema.

Columbia Heights soon annexed all the land surrounding Hilltop, and began to make antagonistic moves towards the young town, at one point threatening to halt Hilltop&#x27;s water and sewer service for punitive reasons. Another item of conflict was Hilltop&#x27;s plan to issue liquor licenses, which would compete with Columbia Heights&#x27; own municipal liquor store that accounted for a third of the city&#x27;s operating budget. Instead of initially contracting with Columbia Heights, Hilltop opted to contract its fire protection from Fridley and establish its own police department by hiring a retired highway patrolman as police chief and three part-time officers. By 1959, tensions rose to the point where the Metropolitan Municipalities Commission, a predecessor of the Twin Cities-wide Metropolitan Council, asked the then-State Attorney General Walter Mondale to contest the Hilltop charter to the Minnesota Supreme Court.

Hilltop&#x27;s first mayor was William Wychor, who instituted ordinances prohibiting activities such as &quot;fortune tellers and other such like imposters&quot;; &quot;a person known to be a pickpocket, thief, burglar, yeggman, or confidence man and having no visible or lawful means of support&quot;; and anyone &quot;procuring or attempting to solicit money or any other thing of value by falsely pretending and representing himself to be blind, deaf, dumb, without arms or legs, or to be otherwise physically deficient&quot;.

By 1961, Hilltop was growing in population and tax revenue after attracting construction of a strip mall including a supermarket, drugstore, and liquor store, in addition to a bowling alley (with liquor license) and motel. Media in Columbia Heights began insinuating that Hilltop&#x27;s liquor licenses were illegal, but were unable to provide evidence. The town constructed its own water tower in the mid-1960s, which allowed it to tap the Minneapolis water supply and end its conflict with Columbia Heights. In 1967, the town&#x27;s population had doubled from inception to 1,039. Tension between the rival cities began to abate in 1968, when Hilltop mayor Vivian Caesar and Columbia Heights mayor Bruce Nawrocki met alongside their respective city councils to discuss mutual issues. The city&#x27;s police department closed in 1972, when one of its officers drove the town&#x27;s only squad car into a tree and ruined their only source of transportation. Unable to afford a replacement, the police department was disbanded and the town instead paid the Columbia Heights Police Department for service; rescue services were also contracted to Columbia Heights on a per-incident fee.

The city led the Twin Cities area in population loss during the 1970s, going from a high of 1,015 to 817 in 1980. Due to the town&#x27;s small size and the fascination with the trailer park stereotype, what were sometimes smaller incidents caused major headlines in the media of the area. In 1970, then-mayor George Reiter attempted to replace the female village clerk because he believed men were temperamentally better suited for the position, a view held by many of his supporters in the city. Murders were especially troubling for the residents. In 1976, there was a triple homicide in the city, perpetrated by Edwin Clay Hull and Ronald D. Gilbert â both received life sentences. In 1980, three prison escapees were captured hiding out in the trailer of one of their mothers; and in 1987, there was a murder-suicide involving a brother and sister.

In 1991, city manager Karen Danz, who had stood in the position for 20 years, was arrested and convicted of embezzling over $200,000 from the city treasury. Her sonâs band, Fortress, which had made a âbest up and coming Minnesota bandsâ list in Rolling Stone magazine never played another gig after the arrest. With an annual budget of only $250,000 at the time, the crisis nearly drove the city to bankruptcy and jeopardized its police protection agreement with Columbia Heights. The city was ultimately saved by insurance and a fidelity bond. In 1995, the city received more unwanted attention when the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; carried a headline that &quot;Tiny Hilltop is Crime Capital&quot; due to its 131 serious crimes in 1994, which worked out to one for every six residents.

==Government==
Hilltop&#x27;s government consists of a mayor and a four-person city council. The city manager is the town&#x27;s only full-time employee. As of 2003, the mayor&#x27;s salary was $300 a month, and council members received $250 a month.

Police services are contracted to Columbia Heights Police Department based on an annual fee; rescue services are also handled by Columbia Heights on a per-incident fee. Fire department services are contracted to the Columbia Heights Fire Department.

<text>Lino Lakes ( ) is a city in Anoka County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 21,399 at the 2020 census. Interstates 35W and 35E are two of Lino Lakes&#x27;s main routes. It is an outer suburb north of the Twin Cities.

==History==
When European settlers arrived, Native Americans already lived in and around the cluster of lakes that are now called Baldwin, Rice, Reshanau, Marshan, George Watch, Centerville, Peltier, and Rondeau. The Dakota people found this to be a land of plenty, with abundant wild rice and small game. Several Native American burial grounds are in the area. White hunters and trappers began coming to the area from both Canada and the eastern states around 1850. Those who settled on the lake&#x27;s west side had names like Ramsden, Speiser, and Wenzel. The east side was settled by families including the Cardinals, LaMottes, Houles and Dupres. Many of their descendants still live in the area.

Several names were suggested for the new village, most containing the word &quot;lakes&quot;. The origin of the word &quot;Lino&quot; is unknown. A Lino post office operated for about 10 years in the late 1800s. The town board decided to name the new village Lino Lakes. On May 11, 1955, the Village of Lino Lakes was incorporated. It covered the original Centerville Township except the Village of Centerville, and comprised 21,000 acres of land and 1,800 citizens. In 1972, the state legislature changed all Minnesota villages to cities.

The area&#x27;s first unit of local government was the township of Centerville, organized on August 11, 1857, and encompassing 36 square miles. The population of just under 300 was organized into three loosely knit communities known as the &quot;German settlement&quot; west of the lakes, the &quot;Swede settlement&quot; south of the lakes, and the &quot;French settlement&quot; east of the lakes. In the 1950s neighboring villages started annexing land from Centerville Township. To protect the boundaries and allow for the financing of public improvements, the township residents voted to incorporate into a village.

On July 26, 2010, the Lino Lakes City Council voted 4â1 to establish English as Lino Lakes&#x27;s official language. The resolution stated that all official documents would be prepared in English and that the city would not pay for translation of its documents into any other language. Proponents argued that expenses related to translation of governmental expenses were unnecessary. On the other hand, the resolution has been perceived as connected to the English-only movement. MetroNorth Chamber of Commerce president Lori Higgins said, &quot;it makes the area appear unwelcoming.&quot;

In 2024, a large housing development project named Madinah Lakes was controversially blocked amid accusations of racism and segregation.

==History==
The city of Detroit Lakes was founded by Colonel George Johnston in 1871. The city&#x27;s current name has been extant since 1927, to avoid confusion with Detroit, Michigan. Beforehand, it was simply called Detroit. The name was given by a French missionary. DÃ©troit is French and translates to strait or narrows, referring to the sand bar separating Big Detroit lake from Little Detroit lake. The sand bar was dredged and partially submerged to make the Pelican River watershed navigable by steamboat in the late 19th century.

Detroit Lakes was a resting place on the Red River Oxcart Trails. The Ojibwe name for Detroit Lakes is &quot;Gaiajawangag&quot;, meaning a lake with a crossing in a sandy place.

The city grew quickly with the construction of the Northern Pacific Railroad. In 1877, an election finally decided that Detroit Lakes, then still known as Detroit, was to become the county seat. Detroit won the election by a ninety percent majority. The nearby cities of Frazee, Lake Park, and Audubon were also in the running for the county seat. By 1884, Detroit Lakes had many businesses, including the Hotel Minnesota, the Lakes Hotel, a bank, a newspaper, and an opera house. The first county courthouse was built in Detroit Lakes that year also. Some of the city&#x27;s historic buildings still stand, such as the 1908 railroad station and the historic Holmes Theater. The Becker County Museum, located near the Holmes Theater in Detroit Lakes, has information and exhibits on the history of the city and the surrounding area.

==Government==
Frazee is governed by the Statutory City Plan A form of government (in Minnesota, 601 cities operate under Plan A). This plan removes the clerk from the council and replaces that position with a fourth (or sixth) elected council member. The city council appoints the clerk and treasurer to indefinite terms of office. A mayor and four council members are elected to three-year terms. The council meets on the second and fourth Wednesdays of each month at the Frazee Event Center.

==Business and industry==

Frazee&#x27;s three largest employers are Frazee-Vergas Public Schools (160 employees), Frazee Care Center (160), and Daggett Truck Line (102). Daggett Truck Line has been operating for 80 years out of Frazee, carrying refrigerated and dry freight throughout the United States and southern Canada. It transports frozen foods, snack foods, pet food, produce, and manufactured goods. Its trucks return with processed foods or raw materials for local manufacturers.

==Transportation==
Major roads are U.S. Route 10, a four-lane divided highway connecting the twin cities of Minneapolis-Saint Paul to the east and Fargo-Moorhead to the west; and Minnesota State Highway 87, a two-lane secondary road running east from the city.

Frazee is on the Northern Pacific Railway&#x27;s former main line, now the Northern Transcon of the BNSF. In 2015, this line carried an average of 49 trains per day.

Amtrak&#x27;s Empire Builder runs through town in each direction in the early morning; its closest station stop is Detroit Lakes, away.

==The world&#x27;s largest turkey==
Frazee is best known as the home of Big Tom: the World&#x27;s Largest Turkey. Frazee has long been part of the turkey industry. In 1984, turkey growers and committee members put up a giant turkey statue to honor the town. For $20,000, the group commissioned artist Shell Scott to construct the statue, which was built on a metal frame and covered in cement, fiberglass, cardboard, and insulation. The statue, named &quot;Big Tom&quot;, was finished in 1986 and stood tall, earning Frazee the title &quot;Home of the world&#x27;s largest turkey.&quot;

Due to Big Tom&#x27;s physical makeup, the statue needed frequent repairs. There were also complaints that Big Tom was not proportioned like a real turkey. The area committee decided it needed a new Big Tom and commissioned artist Dave Oswald. On July 1, 1998, during the removing process for Big Tom, the statue caught fire from a cutting torch that was being used to remove the wings.

On September 19, 1998, a new statue arrived in Frazee in three pieces on a flatbed trailer. The new &quot;Big Tom&quot; took eight hours to assemble, standing over tall and wide. It weighs over 5,000 pounds, having 1,000 pounds of steel reinforcement. It has 3,000 to 4,000 separate fiberglass feathers, which took the D.W.O. Fiberglass Company over 2,000 hours to make.

<doc id="119428" wikidata="Q730430" url="?curid=119428" title="Bemidji, Minnesota">
<text>Bemidji ( ) is a city and the county seat of Beltrami County, in northern Minnesota, United States. The population was 14,574 at the 2020 census. According to 2022 census estimates, the city is estimated to have a population of 15,946, making it the largest commercial center between Grand Forks, North Dakota and Duluth.

As a central city for three Indian reservations, Bemidji is the site of many Native American services, including the Indian Health Service. Near Bemidji are the Red Lake Indian Reservation, White Earth Indian Reservation, and the Leech Lake Indian Reservation. Bemidji lies on the southwest shore of Lake Bemidji, the northernmost lake feeding the Mississippi River; it is nicknamed &quot;The First City on the Mississippi&quot;. Bemidji is also the self-proclaimed &quot;curling capital&quot; of the U.S. and the alleged birthplace of legendary Paul Bunyan.

==Etymology==
According to &quot;Minnesota Geographic Names&quot;, its name derives from the Ojibwe &quot;Buh-mid-ji-ga-maug&quot; (Double-Vowel orthography: &quot;bemijigamaag&quot;), meaning &quot;a lake with crossing waters&quot;. This name stems from the way that the Mississippi River flows directly through the Lake. &quot;Shay-now-ish-kung&quot;, an Ojibwe leader, moved to the area in 1882 and became the first permanent settler of Bemidji. He informed early white settlers of the name of the lake, but they misunderstood him to mean that &quot;bemidji&quot; was his own name. Consequently, he was known to them as &quot;Chief Bemidji&quot;.

On occasion, in Ojibwe, Bemidji is called &quot;Wabigamaang&quot; (&quot;at the lake channel/narrows&quot;), because part of the city is situated on the Lakes Bemidji/Irving narrows, on the south end of Lake Bemidji, and extends to the eastern shore of Lake Irving.

==History==
Beltrami County was founded on February 28, 1866, by an act of legislation.

Bemidji Township was surveyed by European Americans in 1874. It was organized in 1896, 24 days after the village of Bemidji was chartered, and is the oldest township in the county. In 1897, the county attorney declared the original Bemidji township organization illegal (no reason given) and the township reorganized on June 26, 1897.

About 50 Leech Lake Indians lived along the south shore of the lake prior to the 1880s. They called the lake &quot;Bemidjigumaug,&quot; meaning &quot;river or route flowing crosswise&quot;. Freeman and Besty Doud claimed 160 acres west of and including present-day Diamond Point; they were Bemidji&#x27;s first homesteaders. The Porter Nye family soon followed them.

John Steidl&#x27;s sawmill was on the east bank of the Mississippi River, close to Carson&#x27;s Trading Post. Remore Hotel and Carl Carlson&#x27;s blacksmith shop were on the west side of the river. Bemidji was incorporated on May 20, 1896, and by that time there were three publishing companies, Alber Kaiser, The Bemidji Pioneer, and the Beltrami County News. William Bartleson&#x27;s Stage and Express Service was created to carry mail between Bemidji and Park Rapids. He was advertised by Speelman&#x27;s Eagle, owned by Clarence Speelman, along with other stores. By 1898, railroads came to Bemidji and brought even more business. By 1900 the Village of Bemidji&#x27;s population had grown to 2,000.

Thomas Barlow Walker and John S. and Charles Pillsbury invested millions into timber in 1874, since beaver pelts were nearing depletion by the mid-1890s. Walker owned Red River Lumber Company of Crookston, which claimed almost half of Beltrami County&#x27;s timber. He soon sold his sawmill and timber claim to Thomas Shevlin and Frank Hixon. Logging was done in the winter and sawmilling in the summer. Crookston opened 13 logging camps, which provided jobs and homes for lumberjacks. Between 1907 and 1910 drought and forest fires came to northern Minnesota. Lumber production was Bemidji&#x27;s major industry, but on July 19, 1914, a sawmill burned down, causing disaster for business. It was later rebuilt. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Bemidji&#x27;s business profited, providing food, materials, and services for the Civilian Conservation Corps and Youth Conservation Corps programs. During the war years lumber business stopped, but when men came back from war lumber business boomed, since many people needed homes.

By the 1870s, timber cruisers were already making forays into the great pine forests that surrounded Bemidji. They were seeking new timberlands for Walker, the Pillsburys, Henry Akeley, Charles Ruggles and Frederick Weyerhaeuser, the barons of the wood industry.

Art Lee created the story that the folkloric figure Paul Bunyan came from the Northwoods. Tales about Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox led to public sculptures of them in the 1930s. According to Discover America, the Paul and Babe statues are &quot;the second most photographed statues in America,&quot; surpassed only by Mount Rushmore. The Rotarians of Bemidji commissioned the statue of Paul Bunyan during the Great Depression as a tourist attraction. It was unveiled on January 15, 1937, to kick off a Winter Carnival that drew more than 10,000 visitors.

Today Bemidji is an important educational, governmental, trade and medical center for north central Minnesota. The wood industry is still a significant part of the local economy, with Georgia-Pacific, Potlatch, and Northwood Panelboard all having waferboard plants in the local area. They use wood species that were once classified as waste trees.

==Parks and recreation==
Bemidji is near Chippewa National Forest, Itasca State Park, Lake Bemidji State Park, Big Bog State Recreation Area, and state forest areas. There are 400 lakes within , of snowmobile trails and of cross-country ski trails.

The Paul Bunyan State Trail runs from Brainerd, Minnesota, and Lake Bemidji State Park. It is used for walking, biking, snowmobiling, and cross-country skiing. There is also a bike trail around Lake Bemidji about 17 miles long. Each year an event is held where families and individuals can bike around the lake, with rest stops along the way.

Art in the Park, hosted by Paul Bunyan Communications and Watermark Art Center, is held every year at Bemidji Library Park, across from the Watermark Art Center. Art in the Park has been a summer highlight for Bemidji residents since 1967. The event features more than 100 artists, food vendors, and live entertainment. A variety of items are sold, made in such materials as wood and ceramics, along with clothing and jewelry, photography, metalworking, greeting cards, homemade preserves, food, candles, and soaps. Roughly 4,000 people attend annually. The festival has been renamed the Watermark Art Festival and was held at Library Park on July 16â17, 2022.

Every year, in the first week of August, teams compete in the Dragon Boat races. There are also many food vendors, kids&#x27; activities, and musical and cultural performances. In the early 21st century, dragon boat racing was the fastest growing water sport in the nation.

The Bemidji Polar Days, also known as Winterfest, is a weeklong festival that includes many different activities, such as a polar plunge, and sled derby, broomball, a 5k polar walk/run, curling, pond hockey, and a cornhole tournament.

<doc id="119498" wikidata="Q3509266" url="?curid=119498" title="Education in Quebec">
<text>Education in Quebec is governed by the Ministry of Education and Higher Education (&quot;MinistÃ¨re de l&#x27;Ãducation et de l&#x27;Enseignement supÃ©rieur&quot;). It was administered at the local level by publicly elected French and English school boards, changed in 2020 to school service centres. Teachers are represented by province-wide unions that negotiate province-wide working conditions with local boards and the provincial government of Quebec.

== Preschool, primary and secondary education ==
* Optional preschool, also known as pre-kindergarten (&quot;prÃ©maternelle&quot;), is available for children that have attained 4 years of age on September 30 of the school year. 
* Kindergarten (&quot;maternelle&quot;) is available province-wide for children that have attained 5 years of age on September 30 of the school year.
* Mandatory elementary education (&quot;Ã©cole primaire&quot;) starts with grade 1 age 6 by September 30, through to grade 6 age 11 by September 30. Secondary school (&quot;Ã©cole secondaire&quot;) has five grades, called secondary IâV (Sec IâV for short). Students are 12 to 17 years old (age of September 30), unless they repeat a grade (which is not allowed any longer). Upon completion of secondary V, students receive their high school diploma from the provincial government.

===Religion in schools ===
Formerly, school boards were divided between Roman Catholic and Protestant (called &quot;confessional schools&quot;). Attempts were made to set up a Jewish school board before the Second World War, but it failed partly due to divisions within the Jewish community. This confessional system was established through the British North America Act, 1867 (today the Constitution Act, 1867), which granted power over education to the provinces. Article 93 of the act made it unconstitutional for Quebec to change this system. Consequently, a constitutional amendment was required to operate what some see as the separation of the State and the church in Quebec.

The Quebec Education Act of 1988 provided for a change to linguistic school boards. In 1997, a unanimous vote by the National Assembly of Quebec allowed for Quebec to request that the Government of Canada exempt the province from Article 93 of the Constitution Act. This request was passed by the federal parliament, resulting in Royal Assent being granted to the Constitutional Amendment, 1997, (Quebec).

In the 1996â1997 school year, Quebec had 156 school districts including 135 Catholic districts, 18 Protestant school districts, and three First Nations districts. The school districts operated 2,670 public schools, including 1,895 primary schools, 576 general or professional secondary schools, and 199 combined primary and secondary schools.

When public schools were deconfessionalized in 2000, Catholic and Protestant religious education classes along with nonreligious moral education classes continued to be part of the curriculum. Article 5 of the Quebec Public Education Act had been modified in 1997 so as to allow minority religious groups to be allowed religious education classes of their faith where their number were large enough, but this was removed in 2000. Then, in order to prevent court challenges by these same minority religious groups wanting specialist religious education in schools, the government invoked the notwithstanding clause, which expires after a maximum of 5 years. In 2005 the government of Premier Jean Charest decided not to renew the clause, abrogate Article 5 of the Public Education Act, modify Article 41 of the Quebec Charter of Rights and then eliminate the choice in moral and religious instruction that existed previously and, finally, impose a controversial new Ethics and religious culture curriculum to all schools, even the private ones. The ERC course has been taught starting in September 2008. Several court challenges have been launched against its compulsory nature.

===Private schools===

Quebec has the highest proportion of children going to private schools in North America. The phenomenon is not restricted to the well-to-do. Many middle- and lower-income families send their children to private schools. The government of Quebec gives a pro-rata subsidy for each child to any private school which meets its standards and follows its prescriptions, reducing tuition costs to approximately 30% of non-subsidized private schools.

Most of the private schools are secondary institutions, though there are a few primary schools, most of them serving precise religious or cultural groups such as Armenian Orthodox Christians or certain Jewish faiths.

Approximately 17% of the high school population of Quebec currently attends a private high school. The figure is even higher in urban centres such as Montreal, where 30% of high school students are in the private sector. A study released in August 2004 by the Quebec Ministry of Education revealed that, over the preceding five years, the private sector had grown by 12% while the public sector had shrunk 5.6%, with a slightly steeper rate in the last year.

Private secondary schools usually select their students by having them go through their own scholastic exams and by making a study of the entire primary school record.

The Quebec public sector teachers&#x27; unions oppose any form of subsidy to private schools. They claim (1) that private schools select only the brightest and most capable students and reject children with learning difficulties, and argue (2) that by doing this they leave a burden to the public sector. Private schools usually have teachers who are not unionized, or who belong to associations not affiliated with the main body of Quebec public sector teachers&#x27; unions. The debate over the subsidies has been going on for several decades.

=== &quot;Polyvalentes&quot; ===
A &quot;polyvalente&quot; (English: &quot;comprehensive&quot;) is a multi-functional secondary school specific to the Quebec school system. The difference between a &quot;polyvalente&quot; and a regular high school is that a &quot;polyvalente&quot; also contains a section dedicated to vocational training, in addition to general training. However, the term has not been officially used since February 10, 2001. It is preferable to use the term &quot;Ã©cole secondaire&quot; (secondary school) for any type of institution where a high school education is offered, except for institutions already known as &quot;polyvalente&quot; The first &quot;polyvalentes&quot; were created during the 1960s under the initiative of education minister Paul GÃ©rin-Lajoie.

===Language in schools===
Quebec has publicly funded French and English schools. In publicly funded primary and secondary schools, according to the Charter of the French Language, all students must attend a French language school, except:
* students with a parent who did most of their elementary or secondary studies in English in Canada and is also a Canadian citizen
* students who have already done all or most of their elementary or secondary studies in English in Canada, or who have a sibling who has received most of their education in English in Canada, as long as a parent is a Canadian citizen.

Many attend publicly funded English schools. These rules do not apply to temporary residents of Quebec or First Nation children. If a parent had the right to attend English schools, but did not, they do not lose the right for their children.

English is taught as a second language in French primary schools from grade 1 onward, and a few schools also offer English immersion programs for advanced students. English schools offer a large range of programs that include French as a second language, French immersion, and fully bilingual programs that teach both English and French as first languages.

=== School service centres ===
The political party, Coalition Avenir QuÃ©bec, passed Bill 40 on February 8, 2020. This expropriated the province&#x27;s 60 French school boards, turning them into school service centres.

Bill 40 was passed to expropriate school boards that have been running in English style for 175 years. This did not include nine English school boards. But the move is seen as further undermining English-language education in the province. Bill 40 also does not affect the three Indigenous school boards under Canadian control in Quebec territory.

The abolishing of French school boards is said to save the government more than $10 million. Their reason for this is to try to improve the quality of education in Quebec.

===French===
The 60 Francophone school service centres are now to be run with five staff members, five parents and five members of the community.

===English===
On the other hand, English school board commissioners remain on the job until November 1, 2020, but they will then involve four staff members, four community representatives and between eight and seventeen parents.

The English school boards of Quebec invoked Article 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom, which is the official language minority education rights. They took legal action to get exempted from Bill 40.

==Post-secondary education==
Students may pursue post-secondary education after completing compulsory schooling (elementary and secondary) in Quebec. Post-secondary education in Quebec includes two levels: college education and university education. Of note, the term &#x27;post-secondary&#x27; in this entry is used specifically within the context of Quebec. Unique to QuÃ©bec, this level is a bridge between compulsory schooling and university education. At the university level, education is provided by individual universities. These institutions have an education structure tantamount to that found elsewhere in North America.

===Colleges===

College education is given by institutions known as Colleges. Both private and public institutions (CEGEPs, which is officially coined in French as &quot;CollÃ¨ge d&#x27;enseignement gÃ©nÃ©ral et professionnel&quot;) of this type exist within the province.

Unique to QuÃ©bec, college education serves to bridge compulsory schooling and university education, since it is the only province that requires 11 years of study (instead of 12) to obtain a high school diploma. For admission purposes, Canadian provinces other than Quebec do not consider completion of grade 11 in Quebec (Sec V)âor, more simply, the secondary diploma of Quebecâto be sufficient for university admission (or admission at other post-secondary institutions). Hence, although some exceptions exist, successful completion of college education in Quebec is generally required to gain qualifications for university admission.

Students who enter college can specialize in a number of different technical or pre-university fields. The term of study is two years for pre-university and three years for most vocational or technical diplomas. Students completing college earn the &quot;DiplÃ´me d&#x27;Ã©tudes collÃ©giales&quot; sometimes with other designations attached to this title. Of interest, the term CEGEP can only legally be used to describe the state-run post-secondary (post-grade 11) schools, where tuition is free. The 26 private institutions which offer a post-secondary program recognized by the Quebec Ministry of Education receive a subsidy for each of their 15,000 students, and grant the same diplomas as the public colleges. Unlike the state-run colleges, the private post-secondary schools do not have to combine pre-university and vocational programs in one institution. About half offer pre-university and the other half offer vocational programs.

Holders of the two-year college diploma still must complete a minimum of three years of university education in order to obtain a bachelor&#x27;s degree. Under Canadian law, bachelor&#x27;s degrees from government-accredited universities in Canada are considered equal, whether from Quebec or other provinces. Those unfamiliar with Quebec may wonder if three-year university programs there are therefore equal to four-year university programs in other provinces, or in other countries where four-year first university degree programs are the norm. However, given that college diploma holders are granted up to one year of advanced standing credit at any university, it is clear that this is not the case. What exists in Quebec is simply a different structure of education than in other provinces, which ultimately yields exactly the same total duration of study when years of secondary and post-secondary study are combined.

Graduates of two-year college programs often receive up to one year of advanced standing at universities outside of Quebec, but no more than this. Effectively, the first year of college study is considered equivalent to grade twelve in all other provinces, while the second year is considered to be equal to the freshman university year. Chronologically and legally, this is true and has been in effect for the entire modern era of education in Canada.

===Universities===

Primary school, secondary school, and college add up to 13 years of pre-university study, one more than other provinces (although part of college study is post-secondary, as evidenced by the treatment of college diplomas in and outside of Quebec). For this reason, most undergraduate university degrees in Quebec universities are three years in length for Quebec students who have obtained a college diploma. Universities from outside Quebec have four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree programs, because secondary study in all provinces outside of Quebec ends with grade 12 (rather than secondary study ending with grade 11 and then being followed by two years of college study, as in Quebec). University education in Quebec is much like in other North American jurisdictions. In addition to formerly private institutions, the government of Quebec founded a network of universities in several cities across the province, called the UniversitÃ© du QuÃ©bec. All universities in the province have since become public in a similar fashion to other Canadian provinces.

From the standpoint of post-secondary institutions outside of Quebec who may be trying to determine transfer credit, there are essentially two ways in which to interpret the two-year college program, bolstered by local and countrywide legislation. The first option is to remove the first year of college study from consideration, since it is in fact the twelfth year of study overall in Quebec (similar to grade 12), and the laws of the land throughout Canada dictate that a high school diploma from Quebec lacks one additional year in order to be considered the equivalent of a high school diploma elsewhere. The second option would be to include both years of college study in the evaluation, knowing that the maximum of possible transfer credit/advanced standing is one year at the freshman level. This second option is viable if one is uncomfortable with using the chronological separation of year 12 and year 13 as their rationale, especially since college courses are not necessarily all taken in a predetermined chronological order, as the order can vary from student to student.

Quebec subsidizes post-secondary education and controls tuition fees, resulting in low student costs in university education. There are three levels of tuition: Quebec resident (lowest level), Out-of-province Canadian resident (tuition set to average Canadian tuition) and International tuition (highest). The Quebec resident tuition is only available to residents of Quebec, residents of jurisdictions that have bilateral agreements with the Quebec government, and to students enrolled in French literature or Quebec studies programs.

Greater Montreal has eleven universities, founded over the course of 200 years. In 2015, it had more than 155,000 students (full-time equivalent), or 65% of Quebec&#x27;s student population.

==History==

Originally an Ojibway territory, Sand Prairie, saw its first settlers of European origin in the autumn of 1844. 
Under a mandate of the United States government and after the Ojibway ceded their land in the Treaty of 1837, the Territory of Minnesota was established in 1849. Benton County became one of nine organized counties. The village of Rice was named after Massachusetts born hotelier and mill owner, George T. Rice. Rice migrated to the village of Langola in 1864 to develop the area. In 1877, the Northern Pacific Railroad came through, and George T. Rice hired F.W. Earl to build the Luther hotel. The village of Rice became officially incorporated within Benton County, on July 18, 1890, as a farming community.

On April 14, 1886, Rice, along with Sauk Rapids and St Cloud, were hit by the Sauk Rapids Tornado. It is the deadliest in the history of Minnesota.

In 1993, Rice was named a Tree City USA by The National Arbor Day Foundation.

===Toquatennial Days===
In an effort to promote tourism, the Graceville Civic Group began Toquatennial Days on the first weekend of July in 1988, the 110th anniversary of the town&#x27;s founding. Events included the crowning of &quot;Miss Toquatennial&quot; (entrants limited to women who would be seniors at the high school), a &quot;Medallion Hunt&quot;, softball tournament, Sunday evening ice cream social and drag competition (an apparent parody of past Miss Toquatennials), two street dances (a free &quot;kiddie&quot; dance on Friday night, and the Graceville Volunteer Fire Department Fundraiser dance on Saturday night), and the Saturday morning &quot;Graceville Gallop&quot;, a six-kilometer walk/run that circles Toqua Lake. The events culminated with a fireworks display at dusk on Sunday evening over Toqua Lake. Events continued to be held annually on the first weekend of July or last weekend of June until the Civic Group disbanded in 1998, but several local businesses and the Volunteer Fire Department have independently kept many of the events going every year, including the addition of a 3-on-3 basketball tournament and fire department &quot;water fights&quot;.

History of Otrey Township
As Told By Nellie Otrey McLane 1873-1958

William Otrey was born in Somerset, England, coming to America when he was four years old. He and his brother Thomas enlisted in the army during the Civil War. After the war, they took their mustering out pay coming to Chicago where they invested in trappers outfits. Setting out from there they trapped their way to Kandiyohi where they spent the winter with an English family named Hart trapping and working for their board.

They arrived in Big Stone County just two days after the Ole Bolsta family and found a location to their liking on the shores of the lake that still bears their name. Long Tom Lake was named by William for his brother, Tom. They continued their trapping operations very successfully taking their furs to the Green Leaf store east of Litchfield, MN for it was there they received the best prices. Their supplies were also hauled from this store.

The next year Mrs. Otrey came to live here. Mr. Otrey helped new settlers set traps and taught them the ways of living on the prairie. Some said that had it not been for Mr. Otrey they might have starved.

A group of friendly God-fearing Indians lived in the grove near the Otreys during the winters. They were peaceful and good neighbors. Once they invited the white family to one of their services. It was not customary for them to invite white people to take part in their activities, but they spoke of Mr. Otrey as God&#x27;s man and asked him to sing for them. He was glad to comply and sang the hymn âO Happy Day.â

The Otreys were not particularly anxious that the township be named for them. At first it was called Trenton because one of the settlers had come from a town named Trenton. However, William Campbell felt that it should be named for the Otreys because they had settled their first and it was through his efforts that the name was changed.

<doc id="119527" wikidata="Q2233378" url="?curid=119527" title="Amboy, Minnesota">
<text>Amboy ( ) is a city in Blue Earth County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 535 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Mankato-North Mankato Metropolitan Statistical Area. The city was founded in 1879. It celebrated its 125th anniversary in September 2004.

==History==
Shelby Township was organized in 1858, the year Minnesota achieved statehood. The township&#x27;s main inducement to settlement was its rich prairie loam, rendered still more attractive by the availability of wood lots along the Blue Earth River. By 1860, Shelby Township was the most populous in Blue Earth County. In addition to its 315 residents, it also sustained a small but thriving village known as &quot;Shelbyville&quot;, located in Section 35, about two miles south of modern Amboy. In the early 1860s Shelbyville hosted the county fair. The town included a hotel, church, schoolhouse, mill, two stores, a blacksmith shop, a wagon shop, and a post office.

By 1875, Shelby Township was a relatively mature agricultural area, well known for grains and livestock. At that time, the township&#x27;s population was 800, and it remained at approximately the same level for the next thirty years. Despite such overall stability, there were some significant population shifts within the township itself.

The main catalyst for change was the St. Paul and Sioux City Railway (later a part of the Omaha Road), which in 1879 built a north-south branch line through Blue Earth County. In several townships along the proposed route, residents offered the railroad financial incentives to locate a depot in their vicinity including donated land and a red cow with a broken horn. For reasons that are not completely clear, the citizens of Shelbyville declined to do so. On September 2, 1879, they voted down a proposition to give the railroad a $10,000 grant. A week earlier, however, a group of farmers residing two miles north of Shelbyville had made the railroad an offer of their own.

The farmers&#x27; proposal, which was accepted, was to buy forty acres of land for the railroad, if the railroad would lay out town lots, build a depot, and build a grain elevator. The town, named Amboy, was laid out in October 1879. This triggered the death of Shelbyville, which was deserted within three years, the buildings having been moved to other locations. Incorporating as a city in 1887, Amboy had more than 400 inhabitants by the turn of the century.

==Geography==

U.S. Route 169 and Minnesota State Highway 30 are two of the main routes in the community.
