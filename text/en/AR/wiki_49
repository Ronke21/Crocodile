<text>Red Lake Falls is a city and the county seat of Red Lake County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 1,339 at the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Red Lake County. The city lies in the middle of Red Lake Falls Township, from which it was separated when incorporated as a village in 1881. Its status was raised to that of a city in 1898.

==History==

Red Lake Falls was the site of a North West Company fur post as early as 1796 or 1797, making it one of the oldest sites of European occupation in the State of Minnesota. A French Canadian fur trader, Jean Baptiste Cadotte, partner of the noted British-Canadian fur trader, Alexander Henry the elder, established the post as part of a strategy to ward off Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company intrusion into the Red River Valley. The famous Canadian explorer David Thompson took shelter from a storm in Cadotte&#x27;s cabin here in March 1798. The post was abandoned early in the 1800s, as British fur traders withdrew from United States territory.

The surrounding territory was homesteaded by French-American settlers led by Pierre Bottineau, who were relocating via ox cart from their temporary stopping points in Ramsey and Hennepin Counties, Minnesota, in 1876. These pioneers were augmented in 1878 by a number of French-Canadian settlers from Upper Canada. The area developed as a grain farming region. In 1878, Earnest Buse and his partner, Otto Kankel, established a flour mill at the confluence of the two rivers.

The town of Red Lake Falls soon after was platted by Mr. Buse, who then moved on to other environs. The Kankel family continued as a prominent presence in the town through the 1950s. The town prospered for a time, as both the Northern Pacific Railway and the Great Northern Railway ran their lines through the town in the 1880s and early 1890s (both lines are now abandoned), and when Red Lake County split off from Polk County, in 1896, Red Lake Falls became the county seat of the newly formed county, a reason for existence that persists to the present day. The population peaked shortly afterward, in 1900, and has been in decline ever since.

The last significant historic event in Red Lake Falls occurred on August 27, 1927, when the famous aviator Charles Lindbergh and his wife landed at the nearby airport during a barnstorming trip through the Upper Midwest and were taken on automobile rides to Huot and Crookston.

==Geography==

<text>Hector is a city in Renville County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 1,012 at the 2020 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

==History==
Hector was founded in 1878 when the Hastings and Dakota Railway Company constructed the railroad on the north side of the original town site. The ten-block town site survey was completed on September 14, 1878, on land owned by the Hastings and Dakota.

The village was named after the township of Hector, which had been organized in June 1874. It was originally named Milford, but the name was changed when it was learned there was already another Milford in Minnesota. There was heated debate between those who favored the name Plainfield (after the stage stop and post office) and those who favored the name Hector, a township in New York on the east shore of Seneca Lake where many of the early settlers came from. Hector, New York, was named after the bravest of the ancient Trojan warriors whose story is told in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;. (Later research showed the other Milford was actually in South Dakota, so the town could have been named Milford after all.)

<doc id="121565" wikidata="Q2050629" url="?curid=121565" title="Dundas, Minnesota">
<text>Dundas ( ) is a city in Rice County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 1,712 at the 2020 census. Dundas is bordered by the city of Northfield.

==History==
Dundas was platted in 1857 by the Archibalds: brothers John Sidney and Edward T., along with their cousin George Archibald, who built mills on both sides of the Cannon River. The brothers named the city after their home Dundas County, Ontario, Canada.

In 1857, the Archibalds founded the Archibald Mill, a flour mill, on the west bank of the Cannon River. The milling industry contributed greatly to Dundas&#x27; 19th-century success, and at one point the mills in Dundas were considered among the best in the world. The ruins of the Archibald Mill can still be seen today.
The city&#x27;s original central business district was located on Second Street, and by 1866 it included two general stores, a library, hotel, shoe store, restaurant, meeting hall and saloon. The neighborhood began to shift once the Minnesota Central Railway built its station on the west side of the river, resulting in the development of Railway Street and the platting of the Railway Addition in 1865. All that remains of the original commercial district is the Ault Store (built in 1866), which started as a general store and housed the town&#x27;s first library on the second floor; the same building also served as the home of the &quot;Dundas News&quot; for its operation from 1876 to 1879 when it was bought and absorbed by the &quot;Northfield News&quot;.

The Archibald Mill, Adult Store and Edward T. Archibald House are among the five local structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Today, the town is chiefly a bedroom community for nearby Northfield and the more distant Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. The juxtaposition of Dundas and Northfield and their disparate zoning policies and attitudes toward development have led to some unusual growth patterns. Dundas is home to a number of businesses, such as an off-sale liquor store and two bars that would be unable to get licenses to operate in Northfield. Contrary to popular opinion and local lore, Dundas Technical University (Dundas Tech) only exists on T-shirts and jokes from Northfield and Faribault natives. 

Dundas has the only public feed mill within about 40 miles. It is operated by Interstate Mills on the site of the original grain elevator. In 1999, the threat of a Target store being sited in Dundas—rather than Northfield—was instrumental in forcing changes to Northfield&#x27;s zoning to allow such uses.

A Union Pacific freight railroad line passes through Dundas.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. The Cannon River passes through the center of town. The latitude of Dundas is 44.429N. The longitude is 93.204W. Dundas&#x27; elevation is 932 feet above sea level.

Minnesota State Highway 3 and Rice County Road 1 are two of the main routes in the community. Interstate 35 is nearby.

<doc id="121567" wikidata="Q177861" url="?curid=121567" title="Faribault, Minnesota">
<text>Faribault ( ) is a city in, and the county seat of, Rice County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 24,453 at the 2020 census. Faribault is approximately south of Minneapolis–Saint Paul.

Interstate 35 and Minnesota State Highways 3, 21, and 60 are the principal highways serving the city.

Faribault is situated at the confluence of the Cannon and Straight Rivers in southern Minnesota.

==History==
Faribault is regarded as one of the most historic communities in Minnesota, with settlement and commercial activity predating Minnesota&#x27;s establishment as a U.S. Territory. Until 1745, the area was primarily occupied by the Wahpekute band of Dakotah. Shortly thereafter, the tribe was driven south after several clashes with the Ojibwe over territory.


The city&#x27;s namesake, Alexander Faribault, was the son of Jean-Baptiste Faribault, a French-Canadian fur trader, and Elizabeth Pelagie Kinzie Haines, a Dakotah woman. He is credited with fueling most of the early settlement in the area, beginning in 1826, when he established a fur trading post on the banks of the Cannon River. By 1834, the trading post had grown in popularity and was relocated to the Straight River, one mile (1.6 km) upstream of its junction with the Cannon River, the site of modern-day Faribault. The young Alexander Faribault used his knowledge of Dakota language and culture to improve relations with the displaced Wahpekute and even helped the tribe to resettle in the area. This relationship was instrumental in ensuring the success of the trading post and allowing safe travel to the area for settlers. The Dakota in the area called this soon-to-be town &quot;Adek&quot; for Alex (Alexander Faribault).

Another source maintains the city is named for Jean-Baptiste Faribault.

The Alexander Faribault House was built in 1853 by Alexander Faribault at a cost of $4,000, equal to $ today. It is considered the oldest frame structure in the area, and still stands in its original location near the southern edge of Faribault&#x27;s historic downtown district.

The years following the construction of this first building brought unprecedented growth, development, and economic prosperity to the young settlement. Spurred by the completion of the area&#x27;s first steam-powered sawmill in early 1854, the next year took Faribault from a sleepy settlement of 20 buildings to a bustling town with more than 250. Historians attribute Faribault&#x27;s impressive growth during this period to a number of important milestones in 1855 and 1856, including the creation of roads connecting to other settlements and trading posts in Iowa and Minnesota Territory, the availability of mail service, and the construction of schools and churches.

The City of Faribault was platted in 1855 and granted a home-rule charter in 1872.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of ; is land and is water. The confluence of the Straight River and the Cannon River is located within city limits. Sakatah Lake State Park and Nerstrand-Big Woods State Park are nearby.

Interstate Highway 35 runs along the western edge of the city. The city is served by two full interchanges and one partial interchange. Before I-35&#x27;s completion, traffic was routed through town, generating significant sales revenue to the retailers that had a major highway running past their doors. In approximately 1975, the last portions of I-35 were completed and through traffic started to bypass Faribault. On that same corridor through town, the White Sands Swimming Pool (&quot;Minnesota&#x27;s Largest Outdoor Swimming Pool&quot;) operated from 1964 to 1977. This swimming area is now the White Sands Dog Park, as well as the trailhead for the Sakatah Singing Hills Trail, which runs to Mankato. The Mill Towns Trail is planned to run to Northfield. The site includes parking, restrooms and a shelter.

<text>Lonsdale is a city in Rice County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 4,686 at the 2020 census, with a 2024 estimate of 5,112. A fast growing exurb of the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan area, Lonsdale is located 40 miles south of downtown Minneapolis.

==History==
Prior to the American Civil War, a number of families of Czech descent had begun migrating to south central Minnesota from Bohemia. In 1878, a small settlement of Norwegian farmers built a Lutheran church slightly to the southeast of present day Lonsdale. They called the area Trondhjem, after the name of the city in Norway from which they had emigrated. In 1891, a proposed new railroad from Mankato to Farmington was reported in the New Prague Times. However, construction of this railroad was never initiated due to an economic downturn.

It was the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway that proceeded with plans for their existing branch line from Wells to Mankato, to begin constructing trackage northeastward into Farmington. The extension of this line would bring the possibility of development, population growth and job opportunities to towns along the prospective line such as Cleveland, Le Sueur Center, Veseli and New Market. But the businesses of the Veseli area favored the construction of a spur line of the Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis Railway (M &amp; St. L) from New Prague instead.

In July and August 1901, the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railway created their right-of-way with the purchase of a 100 foot wide strip of land that ran through the Trondhjem settlement and was therefore also a few miles south of Veseli. At the end of 1901, landowner Thomas Wilby entered into an agreement with the Milwaukee Land Company to develop 40 acres of his property. But the contract stipulated that he must first convey land to the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railway that was necessary to build a train depot. The Milwaukee Land Company would then survey and plot the remaining acres of Wilby&#x27;s land in order to establish a village. By January 1902, a total of 80 acres had been plotted as a new town site. On July 16, 1902 a grand opening of the town of Lonsdale was held as lots were auctioned for sale. Businessman Martin Benzik purchased several of these lots, and constructed the first buildings in Lonsdale: a saloon, a hotel and a livery stable.

The railroad tracks were laid in town on August 1, 1902, and a 20,000 bushel grain elevator was opened on the other side of the railroad tracks from the depot. To be closer to the railway, some former residents of Veseli placed their homes on skids and pulled them to Lonsdale, using steam tractors. In May 1903, Martin Benzik and other businessmen petitioned for incorporation of the land, known as the Village of Lonsdale. A public election was set for July 1, 1903, and with a vote of 24-0 in favor of incorporation, the city of Lonsdale was born. The initial population of the city was 84 people.

The building of the Catholic Church of the Immaculate Conception was completed by the fall of 1904, a rectory was built alongside the church in 1907, and the Catholic school was built in 1912. Also in 1907, the city water tank was built, and the public school house was constructed in 1908. Calvary Hill Cemetery was established south of Lonsdale in 1910. Several theories exist as to how Lonsdale got its name, but it remains a mystery. One theory is that the town was named after the surveyor from the railroad. Another possibility is that it was named for another place named Lonsdale, either in the United States or England.

==Geography==

<text>Nerstrand ( ) is a city in Rice County, Minnesota, United States.

Minnesota State Highway 246 serves as a main route in the community. Minnesota State Highways 56 and 60 are nearby.

== History ==

In 1856, Norwegian immigrant Osmund Osmundson moved to Wheeling Township in Rice County. He homesteaded the present site of Nerstrand, building a house and farm, and began to envision a town on the site. In 1877 he built a store on what became the right-of-way for railroad tracks on what is now Main Street. In 1885 the Minnesota and North Western Railroad (later the Chicago Great Western Railway) was constructed, extending from Lyle, Minnesota to St. Paul, and Osmundson platted the town on the line, naming it after his hometown of Nedstrand in Tysvær, Norway.

The town was the center of a significant Norwegian immigrant community, which included people in the surrounding township and county. Some, like Osmundson and Tosten Bonde (who lived just outside the city limits), became state legislators. Thorstein Veblen, who grew up just outside the town, became a noted sociologist and economist.

The town incorporated in 1897 and its first city hall was built that year. It proved too small within a few years, and a new city hall was built in 1907. Nerstrand City Hall was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 6, 1982, alongside the Osmund Osmundson House and the Bonde Farmhouse. The Thorstein Veblen Farmstead became a National Historic Landmark. The railroad tracks have been removed.

== Law/government ==
Nerstrand has four city council members and a mayor.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

The town was notorious for the nearby Nerstrand Hill, bane of the locomotive engineer, with the steepest grade on the line from St. Paul to Manly Junction, Iowa.

== School ==
The town has an elementary school for grades K-5, Nerstrand Elementary School, operated by Faribault Public School ISD#656 as a charter school under state law. The school has 155 students as of the 2019–20 school year.

== Attractions ==

Nerstrand-Big Woods State Park is nearby.

The nearby Valley Grove Church Building is considered an important historical site, though several active churches around the area are better preserved:
* St. John&#x27;s United Church of Christ (3 mi southwest)
* Grace Lutheran Church (ELCA) (in town)
* Nerstrand United Methodist Church (in town)
* Gol Lutheran Church (ELCA) (4 mi southeast)
== Economy ==
Throughout its history, Nerstrand has been a source of services to area farmers. A full-service grain elevator still operates today and provides over half the employment in Nerstrand.

The business district declined with the advent of the automobile, with most area residents choosing to shop in Northfield, which has always been more prominent because of its two colleges, or Faribault, the county seat.

As businesses left, Nerstrand became more of a bedroom community for people working in Northfield, Faribault, or Kenyon. A few nonretail businesses, including a cabinet shop and two specialty construction firms, have come to the community, occupying what would otherwise be vacant storefronts.

Luverne is one of four U.S. cities that serve as anchor points for &quot;The War&quot;. The series tells the story of World War II from the perspective of &quot;so-called ordinary Americans&quot; who fought and lived through the global cataclysm. GOP presidential candidate and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum held a town hall meeting at the Palace Theatre January 30, 2012. The packed gathering occurred one week prior to the Minnesota precinct caucuses held to influence the selection of delegates for party nominees as part of the 2012 presidential campaign.
* Carnegie Cultural Center in Luverne, Minnesota, is a historic building originally constructed in 1902 as a Carnegie library. After the Council for Arts and Humanities of Rock County ended its lease in 2020, the city repurposed the space. Luverne Street Music, a non-profit that connects music instructors with students, now occupies the building.

* Rock County Veterans Memorial, dedicated May 28, 2007, is located on the south lawn of the historic and refurbished Rock County Courthouse. Many have likened the quality of the Memorial to what would be seen in Washington, D.C. The Memorial was built by KA.H.R.—a family foundation. Supplementing the Memorial are individual paver stones that honor by name Rock County veterans of all services. The design allows future Rock County veterans to be added to the site. Many surviving World War II honorees were aboard an Honor Flight sent to the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C., on May 1, 2010. Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty and the state&#x27;s First Lady took a personal interest in the Rock County group by being present at the send-off and previously hosting a group of Rock County World War II veterans at the Governor&#x27;s Mansion. Among the veterans on the Honor Flight was long-serving former State Representative Wendell O. Erickson. The memorial lists 10 men as killed or missing in action in the Vietnam War, however 4 of those named (Boyd Beyer, Harold Keith Binford, Arlo Hemme and Dale Ruddvy) do not appear on records of those killed or missing in the war.
* Brandenburg Gallery – Photography from Luverne native and National Geographic photographer Jim Brandenburg is located on the first two floors of the Rock County Veterans Memorial Building dedicated in July 2009 on Luverne Street at Courthouse Square. Featured subjects include wildlife, the outdoors and a focus on the vanishing prairie. Profits from the Gallery go to support the mission of the Brandenburg Prairie Foundation.
* Herreid Military Museum and the Heritage Gallery occupy two upper floors of the Rock County Veterans Memorial Building. Dedicated in 2009, the new galleries building adjoins the new Kahler Terrace providing an outdoor setting for community events. A tunnel connects the building to the Rock County Courthouse, itself beautifully renovated in 1987–88. Both structures were built from locally quarried Sioux quartzite. The Memorial Building&#x27;s transformation from the former county jail and Sheriff&#x27;s residence to a museum complex was driven by the KA.H.R. Foundation of Warren Herreid II and Jeannine Rivet.

<text>Greenbush is a city in Roseau County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 719 at the 2010 census.

Minnesota State Highways 11 and 32 are two of the main arterial routes in the community.

==History==
The word Greenbush comes from &quot;Sha Ach Wah,&quot; which means spruce tree or green bush in Ojibwe. Scandinavian, Polish and Bohemian settlers arrived in the area in 1880s, with the largest influx immigrating in the early 1890s. The Homestead Act gave free to settlers if they set up living quarters and developed a few acres into the fields.

The original setting of the city was on a ridge of what was formerly known to be the shores of ancient Lake Agassiz. This village is now referred to as &quot;Old Greenbush,&quot; and is marked by Hvidso cemetery (also known as Pioneer Haven) along Highway 11. In 1904, the Great Northern railroad came to the area. It expanded north from Thief River Falls to the location of present day Greenbush, where it stopped construction. Greenbush merchants moved their businesses, buildings and all, to the new town known as &quot;West Greenbush&quot;, a feat which they accomplished by rolling the buildings along logs, with horses tied up to posts and walking beside them. Businesses remained open during the moving days.

A few years later, the rail line to Warroad was completed and ran directly through the old town site.

Greenbush officially became a registered city in 1905, with a population of approximately 450 people. Volunteers travelled to Crookston on foot to deliver the official documents, a journey of about one way.

<text>Warroad is a city in Roseau County, Minnesota, United States, at the southwest corner of Lake of the Woods, south of Canada. The population was 1,781 at the 2010 census. Warroad had its own newspaper before it was incorporated in 1901.

Minnesota State Highways 11 and 313 are two of the city&#x27;s main routes.

==History==
Warroad was once one of the largest Ojibwe villages on Lake of the Woods. The Ojibwe fought a long war against the Sioux for the lake&#x27;s rice fields. Occupying the prairies of the Red River Valley, the Sioux often invaded the territory by way of the Red and Roseau Rivers, a route that ended at the mouth of the Warroad River. This was the old &quot;war road&quot; from which the river and village derive their name.

In the 20th century, Warroad had a strong commercial fishing industry, which gradually turned to sport fishing and tourism. For many years, commercial boats provided regular service to the islands and to Kenora, Ontario, at the north end of Lake of the Woods. The lumber industry also boomed, bringing the Great Northern and Canadian National railways to town and seeing the beginning of one of the largest window manufacturers, Marvin Windows.

Warroad is also called &quot;Hockeytown USA&quot; for its strong hockey tradition. The Warroad High School program has earned four men&#x27;s state championship titles (1994, 1996, 2003, 2005) and four women&#x27;s (2010, 2011, 2022, 2023) over 20 years, and has produced NHL and Olympic players.

<text>Belle Plaine ( ) is a city in Scott County, Minnesota, United States, about 40 minutes southwest of Minneapolis. The population was 7,395 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Minnesota Territorial Supreme Court Judge Andrew G. Chatfield selected the townsite of Belle Plaine in 1853 while traveling from Mendota to Traverse des Sioux to hold court, as it was a halfway marker on his usual path of travel. Chatfield chose to name the townsite &quot;Belle Plaine&quot;, which is French for &quot;Beautiful Prairie.&quot;

From 1868 to 1974, Belle Plaine was incorporated as a borough, the only one in Minnesota. In 1974, it became a city.

In 1870, the Minnesota State Legislature passed &quot;An act to aid in the development of the salt springs at Belle Plaine&quot;, which donated six pieces of state-owned salt land to a holding company under certain conditions, notably that a well be drilled at Belle Plaine. The funds put the company under great public scrutiny. A year later &quot;An act to further aid the Belle Plaine Salt Company in the development of Salt Springs at Belle Plaine&quot; passed.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of ; is land and is water.

U.S. Highway 169 and Minnesota State Highway 25 are two of the main routes in the community. The U.S. Highway 169 corridor travels from the city of Virginia along the western edge of Mille Lacs Lake, through the western suburbs of Minneapolis, south through Belle Plaine and Mankato, and then into Iowa. It is a central route of travel and provides easy access to the Twin Cities and southern Minnesota.

Belle Plaine is along the Minnesota River, which flows northeast through town. A bridge crosses on the north side of town via Minnesota State Highway 25.

Belle Plaine is in the Minnesota River Valley, an area of considerable width in which a great river once ran after the glaciers receded that left Minnesota with so many lakes. The ancient river&#x27;s banks are discernible as the slopes of the valley rise up on either side of the town.

<text>Jordan is a city in Scott County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 6,656 at the 2020 census.

==History==
The community began on November 27, 1853, when Thomas A. Holmes ordered the construction of a sawmill. This establishment gave Jordan its first name, Holmes Mill.

A year after the mill&#x27;s founding, Thomas&#x27;s brother William Holmes moved to the site and began platting a settlement. By 1855, he surveyed and recorded his settlement as Jordan City, after the Jordan River in Palestine. Jordan City accumulated some success in 1855 and 1856 with the addition of a post office and a handful of businesses.

In 1860, the neighboring settlement of Brentwood was surveyed by S. A. Hooper, J. H. Gardner and R. W. Thomas. The two settlements competed until a legislative action consolidated them into the village of Jordan in 1872. The consolidation only helped the settlement and by 1880 the population had boomed to 915 along with a boom in businesses in the village. A few of these businesses were breweries, which became especially successful until prohibition in 1919 temporarily caused their closure.

Jordan was incorporated as a city in 1891.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of ; is land and is water.

U.S. Highway 169 and State Highways 21 and 282 are three of the main routes in the community.

<text>Prior Lake is an exurban city southwest of Minneapolis, next to Savage and Shakopee in Scott County in the state of Minnesota. Surrounding the shores of Lower and Upper Prior Lake, the city is south of the Minnesota River in an area known as &quot;RiverSouth&quot; and establishes the urban fringe of the south-southwest portion of Minneapolis-St. Paul, the 16th-largest metropolitan area in the United States.

The area of each is 354 and , respectively. Upper Prior Lake flows northerly, draining into the larger Lower Prior Lake via a navigable channel that runs under Eagle Creek Avenue (Scott County Highway 21). The lake is popular for fishing, water sports, and snowmobiling, and is accessible by the Scott County Snowmobile Trail and other designated trails.

Parts of the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community (SMSC) tribal lands are within the boundary of the City of Prior Lake as annexed in 1972. The SMSC is a federally recognized, sovereign Native American tribe of Mdewakanton Dakota people. The overlap of a Minnesota Statutory City with federally recognized tribal lands resulted in litigation to clarify the boundary and voting rights. In 1984, the United States District Court affirmed that Prior Lake&#x27;s municipal boundary did include the tribal lands in question. The Court further clarified that the tribal residents were thus residents of the city and entitled to vote in municipal elections and to emergency police, fire, and rescue services. The Court ordered the city to provide equal emergency services to the tribal residents even though the tribal lands&#x27; federal trust status deprives the city of the authority to tax the lands. In recent years, the SMSC has voluntarily contributed funds to the City of Prior Lake in support of public safety services.

==Arts and culture==
The &quot;Prior Lake American&quot; was the main city newspaper, but ceased publication after its final issue on April 27, 2024. The &quot;Savage Pacer&quot; is commonly read in Prior Lake. The &quot;Star Tribune South Edition&quot; also offers some coverage.

<doc id="121654" wikidata="Q2045683" url="?curid=121654" title="Savage, Minnesota">
<text>Savage ( ) is a suburban city south-southwest of downtown Minneapolis in Scott County in the U.S. state of Minnesota. The city is on the south bank of the Minnesota River in a region commonly called &quot;South of the River,&quot; comprising the southern portion of Minneapolis-St. Paul, the 16th-largest metropolitan area in the United States. The population of Savage was 32,465 at the 2020 census.

Minnesota State Highway 13 and County Road 42 are two of the main routes in Savage. Interstate 35W and U.S. Highway 169 are in close proximity to the city.

The landing point for Irish and Scottish immigrants in 1800, Savage has grown into a developing bedroom community, absorbing population growth from Burnsville, its larger neighbor to the east. Once a shipbuilding port for the U.S. Navy, Savage is now an industrial manufacturing job center in the southern metro. The city is still relatively undeveloped, with sections of the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge and Murphy-Hanrehan Park Reserve within its borders.

Previously named Hamilton after the city in Ontario, Canada, the town was renamed Savage after Marion Willis Savage, who owned and trained the nationally celebrated racing horse Dan Patch.

==History==
In the 17th century, French fur traders and explorers explored the Minnesota River valley. After 1750, Mdewakanton Dakota then settled at Chief Black Dog&#x27;s camp—near what is now Black Dog Lake in Burnsville. Dakota used the Minnesota River valley region including present-day Savage for fish, game, boating and camping.

In 1852, traders established a small post at the confluence of the Credit River and the Minnesota River. William Byrne, who immigrated from County Kilkenny, Ireland, to Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, in 1840, arrived in the area shortly after, via steamboat from Fort Snelling. Already established in business and trade, he and other Irish and Scottish settlers built Hamilton Landing, a port for boats, named after the city he immigrated to in Canada. The town incorporated in 1892 as the village of Hamilton. Byrne later settled another nearby area which became Burnsville.

The Chicago &amp; North Western (present day Union Pacific Railroad) railway line reached the site in 1865, and in 1866 the town gained a post office. Hamilton became the crossroads of trade and service in the region with the Credit River, Minnesota River, the valley&#x27;s wagon and road trails, and the rail line.

The post office was later renamed Glendale Post Station in 1894 and formed Glendale Township to the west of Hamilton, but was later consolidated with Savage in 1969. The roughly 17 blocks of the late 19th-century town remain as Savage&#x27;s downtown along Highway 13 (Minnesota).

In 1902, Minneapolis entrepreneur Marion Willis Savage purchased racing horse Dan Patch and trained and raced him at his farm in the limits of Hamilton. Dan Patch&#x27;s notoriety grew as the horse began breaking speed records, and with it grew the town&#x27;s prestige. In 1904 the townspeople renamed the community after Savage with the post office officially confirming. In 1906 at the Minnesota State Fair, Dan Patch broke the world pacing mile record at 1 minute and 55 seconds, a record that remained unsurpassed for 54 years.

During World War II, Savage was home to Camp Savage, a Military Intelligence School (MIS) language program, which taught Japanese to American military personnel. Established in 1942, the school trained with niseis and improved military intelligence of the time. It was later relocated to Fort Snelling and is commemorated at Normandale College&#x27;s Japanese garden. At about the same time, Cargill, Incorporated, began building ships for the U.S. Navy at the newly constructed Meadowland Shipyard, renamed Port Cargill (former site of Hamilton Landing). To launch the ships, of the Minnesota River were dredged down to from Savage to the Mississippi River confluence. About 3,500 people were employed during peak production resulting in 18 auxiliary oil and gas carriers and 4 tugboats constructed. After World War II the port began shipping agricultural commodities.

Savage remained undeveloped in the postwar housing boom, isolated by the Minnesota River and without a direct interstate connection. Lack of available construction materials in the immediate area also prevented development. By the 1980s, with the upgrade of Highway 13 and construction of the Highway 169 Bloomington Ferry Bridge in 1996 across the Minnesota River, Savage finally boomed as one of the growing exurbs with low-cost greenfield land in the metropolitan area. The citizens of Savage reclaimed some of their history in the early 21st century, when it relocated the displaced Savage Depot built in 1880 by the then Chicago, Minneapolis and Omaha Rail Road.

<text>Becker is a city in Sherburne County, Minnesota, between the Mississippi and Elk Rivers. The population was 4,877 at the 2020 census.

Becker is located 46 miles northwest of Minneapolis and 19 miles southeast of St. Cloud. U.S. Highway 10 serves as a main route in Becker.

The city is home to the Sherburne County Generating Station (Sherco) which accounted for 77% of the city&#x27;s tax base in 2019 and two thirds of taxes generated for the city in 2023. Homeowners have considerable lower property taxes than surrounding communities due to taxes paid by the power plant. 

==History==
Becker was platted in 1867, and named for George Loomis Becker, a state legislator. A post office called Becker has been in operation since 1870.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of ; 9.1sq. mi is land and is water.

==Business==
Xcel Energy operates the Sherburne County Generating Station (Sherco) within the city. This plant is the largest coal-fired power plant in Minnesota. Because the power plant pays a large amount in property taxes, Becker residents pay considerably less in property taxes than in nearby communities. The city has relied on property taxes from the power plant with about 2/3 of the cities taxes coming from the plant. There have been proposals to close portions of the power plant since 2015 and the city has worked to develop plans should that property tax revenue fall. In 2023, Becker successfully lobbied the Minnesota legislature for aid in expectation of reduced taxes.

Becker Minnesota&#x27;s zip code, 55308, was listed by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency in 2020 as the state&#x27;s largest single source of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent emissions from &#x27;air permitted facilities&#x27;. Sherco operator Excel Energy has announced plans to close the plants by the end of the decade.

Google originally planned to build a data center in Becker, the company would&#x27;ve become one of Xcel Energy&#x27;s largest customers. Although Google ended up backing out in late 2022. Instead on February 12th 2024 Microsoft ended up buying 300 acres of land originally planned for the Google site. Microsoft will be building a data center in this area, the time period is unknown at this time.

In late February 2020, firefighters responded to a report of a fire at Northern Metals Recycling in Becker. Northern Metals Recycling moved its operations from Minneapolis to Becker the year before, after being ordered to shut down by the Pollution Control Agency due to high levels of air pollution. The fire was reported to have started under a pile of cars. The fire lasted several days, and caused schools to close in order to conduct air quality testing. More than three dozen fire departments were reported to have been on scene. Eventually, it was decided in tandem with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and the Minnesota Department of Health that the best course of action would be to let the fire burn out. This decision was also influenced by the fact that water resources were being quickly depleted from Becker and the neighboring vicinity.

<text>Elk River is a city and the county seat of Sherburne County, Minnesota, United States, approximately 34 miles northwest of Minneapolis. It is situated at the confluence of the Mississippi and Elk Rivers. The population was 25,835 at the 2020 census, making Elk River the second largest city with an area of 42.33 square miles in the Central Minnesota region after St. Cloud. It is the county seat. U.S. Highways 10 and 169 and State Highway 101 are three of the main routes in Elk River, and a station on the Northstar Commuter Rail line to downtown Minneapolis is located in the city. Elk River is located 33.2 miles northwest of Minneapolis and 37.4 miles southeast of St. Cloud.

==History==

The last glacier to traverse Minnesota is responsible for the creation of the hardwood-forested hills where Elk River is nestled. These hills are made up of coarse materials which is the reason gravel mining is so prevalent in Elk River, and also the reason much of the area is not considered good farmland for culture and agriculture use.

To the south of Elk River lies the prairie. This natural boundary between the prairie and woods was also a boundary between Indian nations. Two battles between the Dakota and Ojibwe took place where the Elk River meets the Mississippi in 1772 and 1773.

===Rivers===

Zebulon Pike passed through the area on his 1805 exploration of the Upper Mississippi River and named the Elk River after the herds of elk he saw in the area. David Frederic Faribault, son of French-Canadian fur trader Jean-Baptiste Faribault built a trading post near the confluence of the Elk and Mississippi Rivers in 1846, which he later sold, in 1848, to H.M. Rice and S.P. Folsom. Folsom moved his family to the place and built a log cabin. French fur trader and guide Pierre Bottineau bought the post and cabin from Folsom. The trading post stood on a bluff just north of the present day bridge across the Elk River on main street. Bottineau also built a hotel in 1850 on the bank of the Mississippi about a half mile below the mouth of the Elk. The two rivers and the Red River Trail, which passed nearby, made this area a good location for commerce.

Silas Lane opened up a farm near the old trading post site, making his claim in section 33 in 1850. A large number of early settlers came from Maine and nearly all of them were experts in lumbering. In 1851, Ard Godfrey and John C. Jamieson, a native of Orono, Maine, saw the potential of the water power of the Elk River and purchased the claim from Lane. They built a dam and a sawmill. Their dam created the first lobe of Lake Orono (called the Mill Pond), which extended from the present day dam to Orono Cemetery Point. In 1855, the area by the dam was platted and the town of Orono (known as Upper Town) was created.

In the latter half of the 19th century, agriculture and dairy farming replaced lumber as the base of Elk River&#x27;s economy. Grist mills and a starch factory, which took advantage of the potato fields to the west, were built.

The Orono-Elk River area continued to grow until by 1860 it had reached a population of 723 people. These early settlers typically came from New England. Elk River&#x27;s population continued to grow following a slow period caused by the civil war. The majority of people moving to Elk River by that time were from Northern Europe.

The village of Elk River was platted in 1865, replatted in 1868, and when incorporated in the winter of 1880–1881, included both Orono and Elk River. By 1870, Elk River swelled to a population of 2,050 and became the county seat in 1872. Around this same time, the railroads replaced the rivers as the main focus of transportation and the Lower Town (the present day historic downtown area) replaced Upper Town as the focus of commerce.

The Orono Dam was destroyed by an ice storm in 1912, but hydropower gave a new incentive to dam the Elk River in 1915. This new dam created the four lobes of Lake Orono as we know it today. In 1916, the Village of Elk River received electricity for the first time. The entire township of Elk River would not get electricity until after World War II.

===Road transportation===
Charles Babcock, a native son of Elk River and the first Commissioner of Highways for the state, had a visionary plan to &quot;get Minnesota out of the mud.&quot; His plan to create a network of paved roads became a model for the rest of the nation and the Jefferson Highway (now Highway 10) became one of the first paved roads in the state. Highway 10 used to cross the Elk River over the dam bridge, but was rerouted to its present location shortly after World War II.

Jackson Avenue used to be Highway 169. For years, the intersection of this road and Highway 10 was the only one with a stoplight in Elk River and on major travel weekends, traffic would back up halfway to Anoka. Work on Highway 169 to bypass Elk River began in 1961. Work on a new route for Highway 101 between Rogers and Elk River began in 1968.

In 1974, the Village of Elk River changed to the City of Elk River. In 1978, the City of Elk River and the township of Elk River were consolidated to create one unit known as the City of Elk River as it exists today. The result was one of the largest land-based cities in the state of Minnesota, at 44 square miles.

Besides transportation, energy has always played a significant role in shaping Elk River. The first rural nuclear power plant in the United States went online in 1960 as Great River Energy&#x27;s (GRE) site in Elk River. It was meant only as a demonstration site and was dismantled after several successful years of operation.

===Energy City===
In the late 1980s, GRE&#x27;s power plant was converted to burn refuse-derived fuel. This innovative source of energy was one factor that helped Elk River receive the designation of &quot;Energy City&quot; by the Minnesota Environmental Initiative in October 1997. As Energy City, Minnesota&#x27;s energy industries demonstrate cutting edge renewable and energy efficient technologies in Elk River.

By the 1990s, Elk River and Sherburne County were in one of the fastest growing corridors in the state and in the country. This population growth and the area&#x27;s high commuter rate factored into the ultimate approval and implementation of the Northstar Commuter Rail service from Minneapolis to Big Lake, which began service on November 16, 2009.

==Attractions==
The City of Elk River has many amenities, offering a small-town feel but close enough to the Twin Cities and St. Cloud.

===Handke Stadium===
Also known as the Elkhi Stadium, it started its construction in 1921. It became a playing field for football and hockey rink in the winter. In 1939 workers built steps, stone retaining walls and a warming house with a fireplace. After a couple years, the Handke Stadium began to deteriorate and had to be shut down. The Elk River Rotary Club fundraised enough money that in 2000 they repaired the stadium. New warming house, wiring and the steps and stone have either been replaced or repaired. Since being newly reconstructed it had been included into the National Register of Historic Places.

===Art===
====Downtown Murals====
In 1991, K.S. &quot;Bud&quot; Houlton commissioned the painting of the first downtown mural. The mural, depicting the former buildings on the south side of Main Street circa 1960, captured the spirit when downtown was the center of the business community. Mr. Houlton had a great interest in local history and created the mural as a gift to the community. Mr. Houlton&#x27;s son, John, clearly remembers the businesses depicted in the painting. He stated the bakery and barber shop are still in operation today, but the business names have changed. The artist is Michael Russell.

In 2001, the Three Rivers Community Theater applied for a grant to assist in providing monies towards the painting of a mural of an artistic and historical significance on the building adjacent to the River&#x27;s Edge Park, located at the intersection of Main Street and Jackson Avenue. This effort to have a mural painted was inspired by numerous community members, business owners, and public entities interested in downtown beautification and continuing to recognize the arts community of Elk River. This project enhanced the social, cultural, and leisure of downtown Elk River. The desire was to draw attention to the Mississippi River for its beauty and solace as well as its historical significance to Elk River. Local artist Frank Gosiak created and painted the mural.&#x27;

====Whimsical Windmill====
The &quot;Whimsical Windmill&quot; is the art piece that was chosen in the Elk River Powered by Nature Art Contest. Artist Carl Zachmann from Fergus Falls created the piece in reminiscence of the windmills on farms that pump water. The gears and representing colors stand for the rivers, the confluence of both rivers, forest and lumber that helped build Elk River, and a reminder of the prairie that help the area&#x27;s agriculture to flourish. The base of the windmill is designed to represent the river. The windmill is located on the grounds of the Elk River Library.

====Art====
Elk River has always been a town energized by its local artists, showcasing talented residents.

Zimmerman is a predominantly rural community. U.S. Highway 169 serves as a main route in the area. The community is 42 miles north-northwest of Minneapolis and 33 miles east-southeast of St. Cloud.

==History==
The Village of Lake Fremont was incorporated in 1910. In 1967, the town was renamed the City of Zimmerman. Lake Fremont was named for the western explorer, John C. Frémont, and the name Zimmerman derives from Moses Zimmerman, a local farmer who was influential in promoting the idea of the Great Northern Railway coming through the area.

==Events==
Every year on Memorial Day weekend Zimmerman holds a community event called the &quot;Wild West Days&quot;. This includes a carnival in Lion&#x27;s Park, a softball tournament, a 5k charity run, a fireworks show, a parade, and many other activities. The parade usually includes the Elk River School District&#x27;s marching band cadets, the fire department from Zimmerman, and floats from some of the businesses in the area. Also, the weekend after Labor Day, the Zimmerman/Livonia Fire Dept. has its annual open house with tours of the fire station, safety demonstrations and other activities, followed by a street dance in front of the station. This event is usually complemented by events involving many of the area&#x27;s churches and organizations.

==Points of interest==
Zimmerman is close to many lakes. Lake Fremont is a spring-fed lake on the city&#x27;s eastern boundary. It offers fishing, boating and swimming. Zimmerman is also the gateway to the Sherburne National Wildlife Refuge, one of the few natural oak savannas in the country. Zimmerman is also near the Sand Dunes State Forest, which features many miles of horse and snowmobile trails, camping, fishing, hiking, and swimming.

<text>Henderson is a town in Sibley County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 960 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Henderson was founded in August 1852 by Joseph R. Brown, and was named for his mother&#x27;s maiden name.

By 1855, Henderson had become a fast-growing city. It harbored more than 60 buildings, including a hotel, a warehouse, a steam sawmill, as well as Brown&#x27;s house, which functioned as a boarding house, a store and the Brown family residence.

In the following years, Henderson quickly became a major distribution center for the inland settlements surrounding the Minnesota River Valley. It was the trailhead of the Henderson-Pembina road.

By the mid-1860s, Henderson had two major brickyards, The Mattei and Schwartz Brickyards, which both contributed heavily to the early 1900s brick-style buildings still found in Henderson.

The seat for Sibley County was originally established in Henderson, and an imposing courthouse was erected, being put into service in 1879. But pressure from residents of Gaylord, from as far back as 1887, to gain the county seat precipitated a 1915 countywide vote that resulted in Gaylord gaining the seat; this caused around 200 residents to leave Henderson, a major decline in the town&#x27;s population. During the 50 years after that population loss, Henderson&#x27;s economy increasingly centered on agriculture. Its success in transitioning to agriculture brought rise to the present &quot;Sauerkraut Days&quot; celebration. The former courthouse, now the Henderson Community Building, houses Henderson City offices.

==Museums and library==
