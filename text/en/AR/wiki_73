<text>Bath is a town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,077 at the 2020 census, unchanged from the 2010 census. Now a tourist destination and commuter town for Littleton, the town is noted for its historic architecture, including the Brick Store and three covered bridges. Bath includes the village of Swiftwater and part of the district known as Mountain Lakes.

==History==

The town was granted to the Rev. Andrew Gardner and 61 others on September 10, 1761, by Governor Benning Wentworth, who named it for William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath. It was first settled in 1765 by John Herriman from Haverhill, Massachusetts. But the terms of the original grant were unfulfilled, so Bath was regranted on March 29, 1769, by Governor John Wentworth. The first census, taken in 1790, recorded 493 residents.

Situated at the head of navigation on the Connecticut River, and shielded from strong winds by the Green Mountains to the west and White Mountains to the east, Bath soon developed into &quot;...one of the busiest and most prosperous villages in northern New Hampshire.&quot; Intervales provided excellent alluvial soil for agriculture, and the Ammonoosuc and Wild Ammonoosuc rivers supplied water power for mills. The population reached 1,627 in 1830, when 550 sheep grazed the hillsides. A vein of copper was mined. The White Mountains Railroad up the Ammonoosuc River valley opened August 1, 1853, shipping Bath&#x27;s lumber, potatoes, livestock and wood pulp. By 1859, the town had two gristmills and two sawmills. Other industries would include a woolen mill, creamery, distillery and two starch factories.
A disastrous fire swept through Bath village on February 1, 1872, destroying the Congregational church, Bath Hotel and several dwelling houses. The church was rebuilt in 1873. By 1874, Bath was served by the Boston, Concord and Montreal and White Mountains (N.H.) Railroad.

But nearby Woodsville in the town of Haverhill developed into a major railroad junction, and the region&#x27;s commercial center shifted there. By 1886, once thriving Bath was described as in decay. But this economic dormancy of the Victorian era preserved much early architecture in the village, particularly in the Federal and Greek Revival styles. The Brick Store, built in 1824 and designed by Alexander Parris, dominated the town center until its closure in 2020. Bath&#x27;s Upper Village features a cluster of Federal-style houses based on the handbook designs of architect Asher Benjamin.

==Geography==
Bath is in northwestern New Hampshire, in the northern part of Grafton County.

The Connecticut River forms the western boundary of the town; the Ammonoosuc and Wild Ammonoosuc rivers flow through the town. Bath lies fully within the Connecticut River watershed. The highest points in Bath are a trio of knobs on Gardner Mountain, all found near the northernmost point in town and all measuring slightly greater than above sea level.

Geologically, Bath is located at the northernmost extent of former Lake Hitchcock, a post-glacial lake that shaped the Connecticut River valley from this point south to Middletown, Connecticut.

The town is crossed by U.S. Route 302 and New Hampshire Route 112. The village of Swiftwater is located along Route 112, near the town&#x27;s boundary with Haverhill.

<text>Benton is a town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 374 at the 2020 census. Located in the White Mountains, Benton is largely surrounded by the White Mountain National Forest. The town is crossed by the Appalachian Trail.

==History==
The town was granted by Governor Benning Wentworth on January 31, 1764, to Theophilus Fitch and others. It was named &quot;Coventry&quot; after Coventry, Connecticut, hometown to many of the settlers, who arrived shortly after the beginning of the Revolution. At the suggestion of Governor Isaac Hill, the name was changed on December 4, 1840, to Benton, in honor of Thomas Hart Benton, the Missouri senator who championed American westward expansion.

With a rough and mountainous terrain, the town was not suited for agriculture. But Benton had water power sites and abundant forests. By 1859, when the population was 478, there were five sawmills producing a large quantity of lumber. The Boston, Concord &amp; Montreal Railroad ran through the town, which once included the village of Glencliff.

Atop Mount Moosilauke in 1860 was built the Prospect House, later renamed the Tip Top House, a stone hotel with accommodations for 35 hikers. A carriage road was built to the summit in 1870, so the hotel was enlarged in 1872 to accommodate 50 guests. In 1920, the hotel and land were given to Dartmouth College, but in 1942, the Tip Top House burned.

<doc id="124647" wikidata="Q2417533" url="?curid=124647" title="Bethlehem, New Hampshire">
<text>Bethlehem is a hillside town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 2,484 at the 2020 census. It is home to Cushman and Strawberry Hill state forests. The eastern half of the town is within the White Mountain National Forest. The Appalachian Trail crosses a small portion of the town in the south.

The main village of the town, where 826 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined as the Bethlehem census-designated place (CDP), and is located at the junction of U.S. Route 302 with New Hampshire Route 142. The town also includes the villages of Maplewood and Pierce Bridge.

== History ==
Granted as &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s Hills&quot; in 1774 by colonial Governor John Wentworth, the town was named for James Lloyd of Boston. It was the last of the provincial grants in New Hampshire. In the aftermath of the Revolutionary War, the original grant could not be found. Lack of documentation deterred settlement until 1787, when the first permanent houses were built. Dropping its homage to Lloyd, a Loyalist, the town was incorporated as &quot;Bethlehem&quot; on December 27, 1799, the name having been selected on Christmas Day. There were just 33 families, with agriculture the only industry.

By 1850, the population had grown to 950, and the town contained a gristmill, five large sawmills, and two starch factories. In 1867, the railroad came to Bethlehem Junction. With it traveled tourists from Boston, New York and elsewhere, many to avoid respiratory ailments in the low pollen count environment of &quot;the highest town in New Hampshire&quot; (as claimed on a present-day sign in the village). Others were attracted by the paintings of the White Mountain artists. Conveniently located near Mount Washington and other attractions of the White Mountains, Bethlehem developed into a Gilded Age resort for the rich and famous.
In 1873, at the beginning of a building boom, Governor Henry Howard of Rhode Island built Howard House. Eventually, over 30 hotels would line Bethlehem&#x27;s streets. Seven trains arrived daily, some direct from Grand Central Terminal, stopping at Bethlehem&#x27;s five depots. Patrons included Presidents Grant, Hayes, Roosevelt, Taft and Harding, as well as author Thornton Burgess and poet Robert Frost. Entertainments included strolling Main Street on a two and a half mile raised boardwalk, carriage rides in the countryside, croquet games, or simply lounging about the hotels&#x27; sweeping piazzas.

On the hills and thoroughfares were built large summer &quot;cottages&quot;, including that of the Woolworth family. Beginning in 1887, an annual Coaching Parade was held, with prizes awarded for lavishly decorated horse-drawn carriages. Ornamentations cost as much as $5,000, prompting visitor Phineas T. Barnum to proclaim it &quot;the &quot;Second&quot; Greatest Show on Earth.&quot;

But the rise of the automobile would bring the decline of grand hotels. Tourists could now explore regions beyond the limits of rail service. Beginning about 1916, Jewish families began arriving in town, often seeking relief from hay fever symptoms. In fact, an organization named the Hebrew Hay Fever Relief Association, which was organized in the 1920s, existed in Bethlehem for many years. For a town in northern New Hampshire, contemporary Bethlehem has a sizeable Jewish community (and a number of synagogues), a legacy of its hay-fever-relief experience.

It was at Bethlehem that the National Hay Fever Relief Association was founded. World War II gave the hotels a second life, as tourists avoided war-ravaged Europe and stayed closer to home. By the 1950s, however, hotel attendance had dwindled. Many would close and be demolished. Today, the town is known for its special Christmas postal cancellation stamp. Every year, people from all over the world send Christmas cards to the Bethlehem post office to have them postmarked. In 2000, it handled 56,000 Christmas cards.

Bethlehem has experienced a continuing controversy, beginning in the 1980s. Casella Waste Systems of Rutland, Vermont, through its subsidiary North Country Environmental Services, purchased the town dump and created a landfill. The company has made efforts to expand the landfill. Town residents have tried to terminate the landfill, but Casella has repeatedly challenged the residents in court.

== Geography and climate ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 0.39% of the town. Bethlehem is drained by the Ammonoosuc, Gale, Zealand and Little rivers, together with Tuttle, Baker and Haystack brooks. Mount Cleveland, elevation , and Mount Agassiz, , rise to the south of the center of town. Town boundaries contain several of the famous 4,000-footers of New Hampshire: North Twin Mountain (the highest point in Bethlehem at ), Mount Hale, Mount Tom, Mount Field, and Mount Willey. Bethlehem lies almost fully within the Connecticut River watershed, though a tiny portion of the southeastern corner of the town is in the Merrimack River watershed, and an even smaller portion on the eastern side of the Willey Range is in the Saco River watershed.

<text>Dalarna County () is a county or &quot;län&quot; in central Sweden (Svealand). It borders on the counties of Uppsala, Jämtland, Gävleborg, Västmanland, Örebro and Värmland. It also borders on the Norwegian counties of Hedmark and Trøndelag to the west. It was formerly known as &quot;Kopparberg County&quot; () until the name was changed to that of the provincial region on 1 January 1997. The province of Dalarna is slightly larger than the county, as the westernmost part of Ljusdal Municipality belongs to it. Prince Gabriel, the son of Prince Carl Philip, is Duke of Dalarna.

The term Dalarna County is mainly used for administrative purposes; it is further divided into municipalities (kommuner). Dalarna County encompasses nearly all of the cultural and historical province of Dalarna (literally, &quot;the valleys&quot;). For the most part sparsely populated and with extensive tracts of wilderness, Dalarna County is almost as large as Belgium in terms of land area.

== History ==

In older times, Dalarna was periodically part of the territory ruled by the governor of Västerås Castle. The 1634 Instrument of Government led to the creation of a county covering Dalarna with its own County Governor. The &quot;Kopparbergs län&quot; (literally &quot;Copper Mountain County&quot;) was finally created by royal decree in 1647. On 1 January 1997, the name of the county was changed to Dalarna County. The small town of Kopparberg is not to be confused with the old county name, since it is located in Örebro County just to the south.

== Administration ==

The main aim of the County Administrative Board is to fulfil the goals set in national politics by the Riksdag and the Government, to coordinate the interests and promote the development of the county, to establish regional goals and safeguard the due process of law in the handling of each case. The County Administrative Board is a Government Agency headed by a Governor.

== Politics ==
The county council of Dalarna or &quot;Region Dalarna&quot; primarily handles health care and public transportation.

After the Swedish county council election in September 2018, the following political parties were represented in the Dalarna county council:

<doc id="124656" wikidata="Q1031897" url="?curid=124656" title="Canaan, New Hampshire">
<text>Canaan is a town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 3,794 at the 2020 census. It is the location of Mascoma State Forest. Canaan is home to the Cardigan Mountain School, the town&#x27;s largest employer.

The main village of the town, where 442 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined as the Canaan census-designated place (CDP), and is located at the junction of U.S. Route 4 with New Hampshire Route 118.

==History==

Chartered in 1761 by Governor Benning Wentworth, the town was named after the hometown of many early settlers, Canaan, Connecticut, which had been named by Puritans for the biblical land of Canaan. It was settled in the winter of 1766–1767 by John Scofield, who arrived with all his belongings on a hand sled. The land was filled with rocks, making agriculture difficult. The town constructed a broad road for its main street on a stretch of level land.

In 1828 attorney George Kimball helped organize building the town&#x27;s Congregational church. He was among the New England abolitionists who founded Noyes Academy in March 1835, one of the first schools in the region to admit students of all races. It opened with 28 white students, drawn largely from local families, and 17 black students; most of the latter came from outside the town and across the Northeastern United States. Many local residents opposed bringing blacks into the town. On August 10, 1835, five hundred white men from Canaan and nearby towns used &quot;nearly 100 yoke of oxen&quot; to pull the building off its foundation, then burned it. Fearing for their safety, the black students left town, as did Kimball, who moved to Alton, Illinois.

Canaan Union Academy was built on the site and was limited to white students; it operated for the next 20 years. After the academy&#x27;s closing, residents sympathetic to fugitive slaves operated a station of the Underground Railroad to help the people reach Canada or settle in New England.

The Northern Railroad (predecessor of the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad) was constructed to the town in 1847, spurring development. Water powered mills were built on the streams. By 1859, the population had reached 1,682, and Canaan had one gristmill, three lath and clapboard mills, and one tannery.

Canaan was the site of a famous train wreck on September 15, 1907. Four miles west of Canaan Station, the southbound Quebec to Boston express, crowded with passengers returning from the Sherbrooke Fair, collided head-on with a northbound Boston &amp; Maine freight train. Twenty-five people died, and an equal number were seriously injured. The accident was &quot;due to a mistake in train dispatcher&#x27;s orders.&quot;

On June 2, 1923, the Great Canaan Fire burned 48 homes and businesses, destroying the heart of Canaan Village (East Canaan).

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 3.20% of the town. Canaan is drained by the Mascoma River and its tributary, the Indian River, which flows past Canaan village. Canaan Street Lake is in the center, and Goose Pond is in the northwest.

Mount Cardigan, overlooking Canaan village, lies to the east in the neighboring town of Orange. A mountain road leads from Canaan to a trailhead in Cardigan Mountain State Forest, where hiking trails on the west slope of the mountain lead to the bare-rock summit. The highest point in Canaan is the top of an unnamed ridge (approximately above sea level) in the northeastern corner of town, overlooking Derby Pond.

Canaan lies almost fully within the Connecticut River watershed, except for the northeastern corner of the town, which drains north to the Baker River and is part of the Merrimack River watershed.

The town is crossed by U.S. Route 4 and New Hampshire Route 118.

<text>Dorchester is a town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 339 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Originally granted by Governor Benning Wentworth in 1761, Dorchester was named for Dorchester in Dorset, England. When the recipients failed to take up the grant, it was regranted in 1766, but also without success. Finally, it was regranted by Governor John Wentworth to 72 people on May 1, 1772, and settlement began soon thereafter. The first settlers were Benjamin Rice and Stephen Murch from Hanover, but originally from Connecticut.

When the first census of Dorchester was taken in 1790, there were 175 residents. By 1859, when the population reached 711, there were eleven sawmills, in addition to several clapboard and shingle mills. Charcoal was also manufactured here.

==Geography==

== History ==
Shortly before the War of 1812, David Choate, a French trader along with his wife, a Choctaw, opened the Choate Stand, an inn along the Natchez Trace. They chose a location near the intersection of the trace and a cross path that led to the Creek Indian Nation, where there was a natural spring to provide fresh water, at the approximate location of the current town square. Journals from the war of 1812 indicate that Andrew Jackson received supplies at Choate Stand. In 1850, the Choate family was forcibly removed to Indian Territory in Oklahoma by the Indian Removal Act, signed by Andrew Jackson. In 2017 Kosciusko inaugurated an annual &quot;Return to Redbud Springs Festival&quot; to honor this history.

The settlement was at one time named Red Bud Springs for a natural spring that was present in the city. Later, Redbud Springs was renamed Kosciusko, for General Tadeusz Kościuszko, a Polish officer who served with the Continental Army and assisted its military efforts during the American Revolution. His name has been anglicized as &#x27;Kosciusko&#x27;.

<text>Cleveland is a city in Bolivar County, Mississippi, United States. The population was 11,199 as of the 2020 United States Census.

Cleveland has a large commercial economy, with numerous restaurants, stores, and services along U.S. 61. Cleveland is one of the two county seats of Bolivar County (the other being Rosedale). Cleveland is also home to Delta State University and The Grammy Museum Mississippi, the first Grammy Museum outside of Los Angeles.

==History==
Named after President Grover Cleveland, the town began formation in 1869 as people moved inland from the Mississippi River. The Louisville, New Orleans &amp; Texas Railroad ran through the town and a portion of the railroad remains there today. Early records show the community was called Fontaine in 1884 and at some point Coleman&#x27;s Station. Moses W. Coleman built the first home on the bayou in the area. In 1885, it was officially named Sims after Rueben T. Sims, who owned part of the land on which the town stood. The village of Cleveland was chartered on March 25, 1886, and the United States Post Office recognized the town as such on August 5, 1887. It was Sims&#x27;s son, B.C. Sims, who was responsible for the name change to Cleveland.

The town grew steadily and by 1901 Cleveland was named the second county seat and a new courthouse was erected. Bolivar County is one of ten counties in Mississippi with two judicial districts.

As more trees were cleared, more land was put into cultivation. In the early days, all of the planting and harvesting was done by hand. At the end of WWI, African Americans left Bolivar County in great numbers, but many stayed, becoming tenant farmers. There was an increasing demand for labor and Delta planters began to recruit overseas. Today, in addition to the first settlers of English, Scottish, German, Irish, and African descent, Bolivar County is its own “melting pot” of ethnicities.

The African-American influence in Cleveland&#x27;s history is quite evident. Nearby Dockery Plantation is designated with a Mississippi Blues Trail marker declaring the location as the probable “Birthplace of the Blues.” Many of the early Delta Bluesmen lived and worked around Dockery, influencing each other and educating the next generation.

In the early 1920s, as the State Legislature considered a location for a new Normal college, Cleveland became the obvious choice due to its central Delta location, the railroad, and the donation of land. However, perhaps the most important factor in the equation was the City leaders’ willingness to relocate the infamous Black Bear Saloon that was located between the depot and the soon-to-be Delta Normal College, now Delta State University. In the early 1950s city leaders were able to attract Baxter Laboratories and Mississippi Power &amp; Light’s Delta Steam Electric Station just north of town. The population of Cleveland basically doubled over the following decade.

In 1967, Senators Robert F. Kennedy and Joseph S. Clark Jr. began Senate hearings to assess the effectiveness of the War on Poverty programs. The first field hearings were held in Jackson, Mississippi, and the following day Kennedy and Clark set out to visit &quot;pockets of poverty&quot; in the Mississippi Delta. They arrived in Cleveland, along with Marian Wright and Peter Edelman, for a tour conducted by Amzie Moore. There they observed barefoot, underfed African-American children in tattered clothing, with vacant expressions and distended bellies. Kennedy told Edelman that he thought he had seen the worst poverty in the nation in West Virginia, but it paled in comparison to the poverty he observed in Cleveland.

Most recently, the City of Cleveland and Bolivar County, partnering with DSU, was able to see the realization of the Grammy Museum adjacent to Delta State’s campus. It is the most technologically advanced music museum in the world.

Cleveland is also home to the Railroad Heritage Museum, housing the largest O gauge model layout in the southeast, thousands of railroad artifacts, and a 1941 Illinois Central caboose, all paying tribute to Cleveland&#x27;s railroad beginnings. The Mississippi Delta Chinese Heritage Museum is located on the third floor of the Delta State Archives &amp; Museum. The Boo Ferriss Baseball Museum, located beside the DSU baseball stadium, honors the late Red Sox pitcher and Hall of Famer, Boo Ferriss, a Shaw, Miss. native and legendary coach at DSU. The Amzie Moore House is the actual home of the late Civil Rights leader, which has been preserved and converted into a museum, paying tribute to his efforts. The home has also been designated as a stop on the Freedom Trail.

Delta Oil Mill has been producing cottonseed products in Jonestown since 1942.

In a 2000 study published by Mississippi State University, Jonestown was described as a community &quot;plagued by difficult problems.&quot; Agriculture no longer supported the town as it once had, and many Jonestown residents were employed outside the community. &quot;The direction of Jonestown has declined because of the loss of its financial independence. Citizens have been forced to seek opportunity outside of their own town. As people become more dependent on other cities, the need to stay in Jonestown diminishes.&quot;

Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Charles Simic wrote in 2006:There are towns like Jonestown, Mississippi, that in their shocking poverty make one gasp. Weathered, sagging and unpainted houses, boarded-up windows, others covered with plastic, yards full of dismantled rusty cars, their parts scattered about amid all kinds of other junk and trash, are everywhere. Idle people of all ages lounge on collapsing porches or stand on street corners waiting for something to do. In the countryside with its fertile dark soil, soybeans have become the chief crop, poultry farms are a major business, and there are nine gambling casinos in the next county. All that has increased per capita income in the region, but there was no evidence of it among the blacks I saw.

==Education==
Jonestown is served by the Coahoma County School District. Residents are served by Jonestown Elementary School and Coahoma County Junior-Senior High School.

==Infrastructure==
Durocher Service Program is a well-regarded benevolent organization providing social services to Jonestown residents. It is operated by the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary.

<text>Franconia is a town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,083 at the 2020 census. Set in the White Mountains, Franconia is home to the northern half of Franconia Notch State Park. Parts of the White Mountain National Forest are in the eastern and southern portions of the town. The Appalachian Trail crosses the town.

==History==
Town status was first granted in 1764 by colonial Governor Benning Wentworth as &quot;Franconia&quot;, a name widely applied to the region by 1760 due to the terrain&#x27;s resemblance to the Franconian Switzerland in Upper Franconia, Bavaria, Germany. Upon claims that a settlement was not made within the time prescribed under the terms of the charter, it was regranted in 1772 by his nephew, Governor John Wentworth, as &quot;Morristown&quot;. Sometime between 1779 and 1782, after a legal battle over the two grants, the first grant was recognized and the original name of the town was resumed.

The town sits on a rich iron deposit, and the region once produced pig iron and bar iron for farm tools and cast iron ware.
Franconia is home to the Cannon Mountain Aerial Tramway, which rises to the summit of Cannon Mountain. Built in 1938, it was the first passenger aerial tramway in North America. From the time of its construction in 1938 to its retirement in 1980, the original tramway carried 6,581,338 passengers to the summit of Cannon Mountain. The original tramway was replaced by a new 80-passenger tram in 1979. Construction and testing of the new tram were completed in February 1980, and the red and yellow tram cars are still running year-round today.

Around 1940, actress Bette Davis vacationed in Sugar Hill, the town bordering Franconia to the west. On a solo hike to Bridal Veil Falls at the western foot of Cannon Mountain, she got lost in the woods. Arthur Farnsworth, who worked at Peckett&#x27;s Ski School, found her and rescued her from the woods. They fell in love and soon married. Farnsworth died unexpectedly as a result of freak accident in Los Angeles. Davis had erected in a rock on the trail to Bridal Veil Falls a plaque to commemorate Farnsworth, in which was inscribed the words &quot;The Keeper of Stray Ladies&quot;, although Davis did not include her name in the plaque. The plaque can be seen today on the Coppermine Trail to Bridal Veil Falls.

The town was home to Franconia College during the 1960s and 1970s. In the 21st century, Franconia has been known as the home of skier Bode Miller, who has accumulated several Olympic medals.
==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 0.47% of the town. Franconia is drained by the Pemigewasset River, the Franconia Branch of the East Branch Pemigewasset River, the Gale River, and the Ham Branch of the Gale River, in addition to Lafayette Brook. The north-western two-thirds of Franconia lies within the Connecticut River watershed, while the southeastern portion which drains to the Pemigewasset and its branches lies in the Merrimack River watershed.

The area of Franconia Notch is well known for its natural features, including Profile and Echo lakes, the Basin, Mount Lafayette, Mount Lincoln, and Cannon Mountain. Mount Lafayette, at above sea level, is the highest peak in Franconia and in Grafton County, as well as the second-most prominent peak in the White Mountains, after Mount Washington. The Old Man of the Mountain, a profile-like cliff on the side of Cannon Mountain which inspired Nathaniel Hawthorne to write &quot;The Great Stone Face&quot;, collapsed on May 3, 2003.

In addition to the mountains around Franconia Notch, there are several other four-thousand footers within the town limits: Mount Garfield, Galehead Mountain, South Twin Mountain, and Owl&#x27;s Head.

<text>Southaven is a city in DeSoto County, Mississippi, United States. It is a principal city in Greater Memphis. The 2020 census reported a population of 54,648, making it the 3rd most populous city in Mississippi and the largest suburb of Memphis by population. Southaven surpassed Bartlett, TN as largest suburb with a population of 56,851 according to 2023 census estimates. Southaven is traversed north to south by the I-55/I-69 freeway. The city&#x27;s name derives from the fact that Southaven is located south of Whitehaven, a neighborhood in Memphis.

==History==
Southaven began as a village when Memphis homebuilder Kemmons Wilson (founder of Holiday Inn) wished to develop a few residential subdivisions featuring small starter homes just across the Mississippi border from what was then Whitehaven, Tennessee, an unincorporated area just a few miles south of the Memphis city limits. In the 1970s, Whitehaven has been eventually annexed by Memphis. Officially incorporated in 1980, Southaven is one of the fastest-growing cities in the southeastern United States. In just 20 years, Southaven doubled its land area, while its population tripled.

The construction of Interstate 55 through Southaven in the 1970s helped to promote growth and make for easier access to the city from Memphis, Jackson, St. Louis, and Chicago. Interstate 69, which will eventually run from Canada to Mexico, was cosigned with I-55 in Southaven in 2007.

In 1988, Baptist Hospital-DeSoto opened in Southaven as a two-story hospital. In 2001, Baptist DeSoto started an expansion project, nearly doubling the size of the hospital. In 2002, Baptist Hospital-DeSoto added an Outpatient Diagnostic Center and a Women&#x27;s Center. In November 2006, Baptist DeSoto opened an eleven-story hospital tower that added 140 beds to the facility, allowing it to offer all private rooms. In addition, the new hospital tower added a new and expanded Emergency Department, more operating suites and space for future additions. It is the first high-rise building constructed in DeSoto County.

The exponential growth of Memphis International Airport (2 miles north of the city limits) in the 1980s led to increased air traffic over Southaven. The city continues to see large amounts of air traffic from Memphis International Airport, as flight paths to both north–south runways lead directly over the city. October 2007 saw the opening of Southaven&#x27;s first large-scale shopping mall, Southaven Towne Center, which is located just south of Goodman Road between I-55/I-69 and Airways Boulevard. The mall is open-air with various stores and restaurants. Numerous buildings in Southaven were damaged on February 5, 2008, when an EF-2 tornado touched down during the so-called Super Tuesday tornado outbreak. Memphis television station WREG broadcast live images of the tornado as it moved through the city and into Memphis. No fatalities were reported in Southaven. By February 2011, Southaven had become the third-largest city in Mississippi. In the late 2000s, an outlet mall was proposed for Southaven. Tanger Outlets Southaven began construction in January 2015 and opened in November 2015. The mall, located near I-55/I-69 and Church Road, includes 70 outlet stores and outparcels of restaurants. Southaven was the boyhood home of noted novelist John Grisham, who also practiced law there for almost a decade, and of singer-songwriter Cory Branan.

<text>Grafton is a town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,385 at the 2020 census.

== History ==

Originally granted in 1761, and re-granted in 1769, Grafton, like the county it resides in, takes its name from Augustus FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton, a relative of colonial governor Benning Wentworth. Grafton was incorporated in 1778.

Historically, Grafton&#x27;s economic base consisted of subsistence farming, small-scale industry, and mining. Several mica mines and granite quarries once dotted the town&#x27;s landscape, most notably Ruggles Mine.

== Geography ==
The town is in western New Hampshire, on the southern edge of Grafton County. It is bordered to the south by Sullivan County and to the southeast by Merrimack County. U.S. Route 4 is the main road through the town, leading southeast to Andover and Concord and northwest to Canaan and Lebanon. New Hampshire Route 4A crosses the southwest corner of the town.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 2.20% of the town. The majority of the town is drained to the east by the Smith River, a tributary of the Pemigewasset River and part of the Merrimack River watershed, while the western side of the town drains by several brooks toward the Mascoma River, a tributary of the Connecticut. The highest point in Grafton is the summit of Melvin Mountain, at above sea level in the northeastern part of town. Grafton Pond is in the western part of town.

The racial makeup of the town was 96.7% White, 0.3% African American, 0.2% Native American, 0.4% Asian, 0.1% some other race, and 2.2% from two or more races.

The average household size was 2.38, and the average family size was 2.84.

The median age was 45.6 years. For every 100 females, there were 108.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 112.1 males.

At the 2000 census, the median income for a household in the town was $38,654, and the median income for a family was $41,875. Males had a median income of $30,074 versus $23,750 for females.

==Government==
Grafton is governed by a three-person select board.

==Politics==
Grafton County, within which the town of Grafton resides, ranks number 100 in terms of highest property taxes levied in the United States. As of 2019, the town of Grafton itself has the 16th highest property tax rate in the state of New Hampshire.

== Free Town Project ==

In 2004, Grafton became the focus for Libertarians as part of the Free Town Project (a single-town version of the Free State Project). One of the goals was to advocate for legal changes. Grafton&#x27;s appeal as a favorable destination was due to its absence of zoning laws and a then-low property tax rate. John Babiarz, a Grafton resident and prominent member of the Libertarian Party, encouraged libertarian people to move there.

During this time, the town&#x27;s population grew by about 200 people (about 20%); nearly all of the newcomers were men. Project participants did not find themselves as welcome as they had hoped, but they voted in changes including a 30% reduction in the town&#x27;s already small budget. This resulted in eliminating funding to the county&#x27;s senior-citizens council, town offices going unheated during the winter, poorly maintained roads filled with potholes, and the Grafton Police Department being reduced to one officer (the police chief), who said he was unable to answer calls for service as the town had no money to repair the one police vehicle left. Other issues were inconsistent basic public services, such as trash collection. The libertarian newcomers additionally increased the town&#x27;s costs by filing lawsuits against it in attempts to set various legal precedents. 

The project has been associated with an increase in the number and aggressiveness of black bears in town, including entering homes, mauling people, and eating pets. A single, definitive cause for the abnormal behavior of the bears has not been proven, but it may be due to libertarian residents who refuse to buy and use bear-resistant containers, who do not dispose of waste materials (such as feces) safely, or who deliberately put out food to attract the bears to their own yards, without caring how this affected other people.

After a rash of lawsuits from Free Towners, an influx of sex offenders, an increase of crime, problems with bold local bears, and the first murders in the town&#x27;s history, the Libertarian project ended in 2016.

<text>Groton is a town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 569 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
It was originally named &quot;Cockermouth&quot; in honor of Charles Wyndham, Baron Cockermouth and Earl of Egremont, who was Great Britain&#x27;s Secretary of State for the Southern Department from 1761 to 1763. Due to non-settlement the land was regranted in 1766, then renewed in 1772. In 1796, one of the later grantees, Samuel Blood, succeeded in renaming the town after his hometown, Groton, Massachusetts.

Groton&#x27;s surface is uneven, although farmers found the soil arable for growing corn and potatoes. A branch of the Baker River in the north, together with several small streams feeding Newfound Lake in the south, provided water power for mills. By 1859, when the population was 776, there were ten sawmills, two gristmills, and a shingle and clapboard manufacturer. Although not open to the public, the Palermo Mine in North Groton is noted for its minerals.

On August 4, 2009, Groton approved siting a wind farm in the town. The wind farm was built by Iberdrola Renewables.

<text>Haverhill is a town and the seat of Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 4,585 at the 2020 census. Haverhill includes the villages of Woodsville, Pike, and North Haverhill, the historic town center at Haverhill Corner, and the district of Mountain Lakes. Located here are Bedell Bridge State Park, Black Mountain State Forest, Kinder Memorial Forest, and Oliverian Valley Wildlife Preserve. It is home to the annual North Haverhill Fair, and to a branch of the New Hampshire Community Technical Colleges.

==History==

Settled by citizens from Haverhill, Massachusetts, the town was first known as &quot;Lower Cohos&quot;. This Lower Cohos name is derived from the original Abenaki people who had a base for agriculture here. It was incorporated in 1763 by colonial Governor Benning Wentworth, and in 1773 became the county seat of Grafton County. Haverhill was the terminus of the old Province Road, which connected the northern and western settlements with the seacoast. By 1859, when the town had 2,405 inhabitants, industries included three gristmills, twelve sawmills, a paper mill, a large tannery, a carriage manufacturer, an iron foundry, seven shoe factories, a printing office, and several mechanic shops. The town is home to the oldest documented covered bridge in the country still standing—the Haverhill–Bath Bridge, built in 1829.

The village of Woodsville, named for John L. Woods of Wells River, Vermont, was once an important railroad center. Woods operated a sawmill on the Ammonoosuc River, and developed a railroad supply enterprise following the establishment of the Boston, Concord &amp; Montreal Railroad. The village of Pike was settled by future employees of the Pike Manufacturing Company, which was once the world&#x27;s leading manufacturer of whetstones.

While the village of Haverhill Corner was historically considered to be the primary settlement in town, the town&#x27;s municipal offices are currently located in the village of North Haverhill, with Grafton County&#x27;s offices and courthouse located just two miles farther north along Route 10. The county seat offices were located in Woodsville until 1972, when the administrative offices relocated to rural land halfway between Woodsville and North Haverhill.

The village of Woodsville is now the commercial center of Haverhill and its smaller surrounding towns, including several in Vermont. Woodsville is home to the town&#x27;s supermarkets, pharmacies, banks (including the headquarters of the regional Woodsville Guaranty Savings Bank), state liquor store, and most of its restaurants and chain stores, although a few are located in North Haverhill. The town&#x27;s elementary and high schools, along with Cottage Hospital, a critical-access hospital serving the area, are all located in Woodsville.

==Geography==
Haverhill is in northwestern New Hampshire. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 2.62% of the town. Bounded on the west by the Connecticut River, which forms the state border with Vermont, Haverhill is drained by the Ammonoosuc River, in addition to Oliverian Brook and Clark Brook. Haverhill lies fully within the Connecticut River watershed.

The highest point in Haverhill, at above sea level, is on the western slope of Black Mountain, whose summit is in the neighboring town of Benton.

The town is served by six state-maintained routes. New Hampshire Route 10 is the main north–south highway through Haverhill, paralleling the Connecticut River. U.S. Route 302 enters from Vermont and passes east–west through Woodsville in the northern part of town, joining with Route 10 to head northeast to Bath and Littleton. New Hampshire Route 25 enters Haverhill from Piermont while co-signed with Route 10, splitting off by itself to the southeast in Haverhill Corner. New Hampshire Route 116 has its southern terminus at Route 10 in North Haverhill, and New Hampshire Route 135 has its southern terminus at Route 10 just south of Woodsville. A very short section of New Hampshire Route 112 passes through the northeastern part of town. Haverhill also has easy access to U.S. Route 5 via bridges in North Haverhill and Woodsville.

== History ==
First settled in 1765, Hebron was incorporated in 1792 from a portion of the extinct township of Cockermouth (now Groton), combined with a portion of what was then called West Plymouth. Most early settlers arrived from New England towns, with no known first-generation emigrants from Europe. The surface was rough, the soil rather stubborn; nevertheless, farming was the primary occupation. Other industries developed after the Mayhew Turnpike was built in 1803, connecting northern towns and lumber harvesting with southern cities and mills. In 1859 the population was 565, when Hebron contained one store and a tannery. By the 1920s, tourism developed into a major occupation, including summer lodges and winter skiing.

== Geography ==
Hebron sits at the north end of Newfound Lake, the fourth-largest lake in New Hampshire. The Cockermouth River, the primary feeder to the lake, enters the town from Groton to the west and passes the town center before entering the lake.

<text>Pascagoula ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Jackson County, Mississippi, United States. It is the principal city of the Pascagoula metropolitan area, and is part of the Gulfport–Biloxi–Pascagoula Combined Statistical Area and the Gulfport-Biloxi metropolitan area. The population was 22,392 at the 2010 census, down from 26,200 at the 2000 census. In 2019 the population was 21,699.

The city is served by three airports: Mobile Regional Airport, to the northeast in Alabama; Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport, about west of Pascagoula; and the Trent Lott International Airport, to the north in Jackson County.

==History==

===Early history===

The name &quot;Pascagoula&quot;, which means &quot;bread eater&quot;, is taken from the Pascagoula, a group of Native Americans found in villages along the Pascagoula River some distance above its mouth. Hernando de Soto seems to have made the first contact with them in the 1540s, though little is known of that encounter. Pierre Le Moyne d&#x27;Iberville, founder of the colony of Louisiana, left a more detailed account from an expedition of this region in 1700.

The first detailed account comes from Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, younger brother of Iberville, whom the Pascagoula visited at Fort Maurepas in present-day Ocean Springs, shortly after it was settled and while the older brother was away in France. There are few details that are certain about these people, except that their language seemed not to have shared an etymological root with the larger native groups to the north, the Choctaw particularly, who speak a Muskogean language. There has been speculation that their language may be related to Biloxi. The Biloxi people spoke a now extinct Siouan language, which is related to the languages spoken by the Sioux, Crow, and Ho-Chunk.

The territory of the Biloxi people seems to have ranged from the areas of what are now called Biloxi Bay to Bayou La Batre (Alabama) and up the Pascagoula River, and the Pascagoula people&#x27;s territory seems to have ranged between some distance north of there to the confluence of the Leaf and Chickasawhay rivers. However, the Pascagoula language is completely undocumented – thus, genealogical affiliations from other authors are speculation.

The first European settlers of Pascagoula were Jean Baptiste Baudreau Dit Graveline, Joseph Simon De La Pointe and his aunt, Madame Chaumont.

===Modern history===

The region changed hands over the next century, being occupied variously by the English, French, and Spanish until well after the American Revolutionary War. It came into the permanent possession of the United States in 1812 when it was added to the Mississippi Territory. At one point, for 74 days in 1810, Pascagoula was a part of what was known as the Republic of West Florida. Pascagoula was incorporated as a village in 1892. It obtained city status in 1901. Today&#x27;s downtown Pascagoula used to be the town of Scranton, Mississippi, incorporated in 1870. The two towns merged in 1904 by Governor&#x27;s proclamation and in 1912 by Mississippi legislative act.

In October 1973, an alleged unidentified flying object sighting and alien abduction is said to have occurred when co-workers Charles Hickson and Calvin Parker claimed they were abducted by aliens while fishing near Pascagoula. The incident, Pascagoula Abduction, earned substantial mass media attention. In June 2019, Pascagoula placed a historical marker near the alleged abduction site. The city honors the abduction every year during an event called Goula Palooza. The festival takes place in the downtown area of the city.

===Hurricane Katrina===

On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina&#x27;s storm surge devastated Pascagoula, much like Biloxi and Gulfport and the rest of the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Katrina came ashore during the high tide of 6:12 AM, more. Nearly 92% of Pascagoula was flooded. Most homes along Beach Boulevard were destroyed, and FEMA trailers became an omnipresent sight.

Due to the media focus on the plight of New Orleans and Biloxi-Gulfport in the aftermath of Katrina, many Pascagoula citizens have expressed feeling neglected or even forgotten following the storm. Most Pascagoula residents did not possess flood insurance, and many were required to put their homes on pilings before being given a permit to rebuild. TITANTubes, sometimes referred to as geotubes, were installed under the beach to serve as low-profile dune cores to protect the evacuation route.

United States Navy officials announced that two guided missile destroyers that were under construction at Northrop Grumman Ship Systems in Pascagoula had been damaged by the storm, as well as the amphibious assault ship .

Hurricane Katrina damaged over forty Mississippi libraries, flooding the Pascagoula Public Library&#x27;s first floor and causing mold in the building.

==Points of interest==

The United States post office in Pascagoula contains a mural, &quot;Legend of the Singing River&quot;, painted in 1939 by Lorin Thompson. Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the Treasury Department. The mural was restored in the 1960s as the building became the Pascagoula Public Library. The building was damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and the mural was placed in storage. In 2010, it was re-installed at the new Pascagoula post office on Jackson Avenue.

Pascagoula is a major industrial city of Mississippi, on the Gulf Coast. Prior to World War II, the town was a sleepy fishing village of about 5,000. The population skyrocketed with the war-driven shipbuilding industry. The city&#x27;s population seemed to peak in the late 1970s and early 1980s as Cold War defense spending was at its height. Pascagoula experienced some new growth and development in the years before Hurricane Katrina.

Today, Pascagoula is home to the state&#x27;s largest private, single-site employer, Ingalls Shipbuilding, owned by Huntington Ingalls Industries. Other major industries include the largest Chevron refinery in the world; Rolls-Royce Naval Marine, specializing in U.S. Navy ship propulsion; and First Chemical/Chemours.

Naval Station Pascagoula was located on Singing River Island and was homeport to several Navy warships, as well as a large Coast Guard contingent. Naval Station Pascagoula was decommissioned as part of the 2005 BRAC recommendations and ceased operations in 2006.

<text>Holderness is a town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 2,004 at the 2020 census. An agricultural and resort area, Holderness is home to the Squam Lakes Natural Science Center and is located on Squam Lake. Holderness is also home to Holderness School, a co-educational college-preparatory boarding school.

==History==
The Squam Lakes were a trade route for the Abenaki and early European settlers, who traveled the Squam River to the Pemigewasset River, then to the Merrimack River and seacoast. In 1751, Thomas Shepard submitted a petition on behalf of 64 grantees to colonial Governor Benning Wentworth for 6 miles square on the Pemigewasset River. The governing council accepted, and the town was named after Robert Darcy, 4th Earl of Holderness. The French and Indian War, however, prevented settlement until after the 1759 Fall of Quebec. The land was regranted as &quot;New Holderness&quot; in 1761 to a group of New England families, and first settled in 1763. As proprietor of half the town, Samuel Livermore intended to create at New Holderness a great estate patterned after those of the English countryside. By 1790, the town had 329 residents, and in 1816, &quot;New&quot; was dropped from its name.

Holderness became a farming and fishing community, except for the &quot;business or flat iron area&quot; located on the Squam River, which has falls that drop about before meeting the Pemigewasset River. With water power to operate mills, the southwestern corner of town developed into an industrial center, to which the Boston, Concord &amp; Montreal Railroad entered in 1849. But the mill village would be at odds with the agricultural community, especially when denied civic amenities including gaslights and sidewalks. Consequently, in 1868, it was set off as Ashland.

Tourists in the 19th century discovered the region&#x27;s scenic mountains and lakes. Before the age of automobiles, they would depart the train in Ashland and board a steamer, which traveled up the Squam River to rustic fishing camps or hillside hotels beside Squam Lake. Today, Holderness remains a popular resort area, where in 1981 the movie &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; was filmed.

In 1924, pioneer ornithologist Katharine (Clark) Harding Day studied a breeding population of the veery (&quot;Catharus fuscescens&quot;) in Holderness.

<text>West Hattiesburg is an unincorporated area and census-designated place (CDP) in Lamar County, Mississippi, west of the city of Hattiesburg and east of the community of Oak Grove. It is part of the Hattiesburg metropolitan area. It had a decline in population from 6,305 at the 2000 census to 5,909 at the 2010 census.
==Geography==
West Hattiesburg is in northeastern Lamar County and is bordered to the north, east, and south by the city of Hattiesburg. The area of West Hattiesburg dropped from at the 2000 census to as of 2019, primarily due to annexation of land by the city of Hattiesburg. Of the CDP&#x27;s area in 2019, , or 0.31%, are water. Lairds Lake is the main water body in the community.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 6,006 people, 2,387 households, and 1,478 families residing in the CDP.

===2000 census===
As of the census of 2000, there were 6,305 people, 4,464 households, and 2,601 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 2,633 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 74.88% White, 22.11% African American, 0.06% Native American, 1.63% Asian, 0.29% from other races, and 1.03% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.38% of the population.

There were 2,464 households, out of which 32.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 47.3% were married couples living together, 14.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 35.0% were non-families. 24.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.50 and the average family size was 3.00.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 25.5% under the age of 18, 15.7% from 18 to 24, 30.8% from 25 to 44, 19.2% from 45 to 64, and 8.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 30 years. For every 100 females, there were 91.1 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 87.2 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $44,663, and the median income for a family was $68,287. Males had a median income of $49,552 versus $43,873 for females. The per capita income for the CDP was $38,988. None of the families and none of the population were living below the poverty line, including no under eighteens and none of those over 64.

==Incorporation==
A movement for incorporation has been attempted repeatedly over the years, but the courts have never ruled on the substance of it. The issues involve getting articles of incorporation which all would agree to, as well as who wants incorporation (who will profit, who will end up paying more in taxes).

Proponents say incorporation will benefit all residents, but the opposition says it will only benefit the persons who hold that property which is yet to be fully developed within the real estate market over the next few years. Another argument against incorporation is that the proposal and its budget outline didn&#x27;t fully account for the additional expenditures and costs of running the new city. Proponents counter that the overall cost will be lower, because of a more distributed risk amongst homeowners, who would essentially bear about 80% of the additional taxes to support this city.

http://www.hattiesburgamerican.com has extensive archives about this issue, including opinion columns authored by the actual people engaged in the debate both pro and con. It is a good case study in local politics.

==Origins of &quot;West Hattiesburg&quot;==
West Hattiesburg was a rarely used term by residents, and was first popularized by out of towners who saw the area listed on Google Maps with that name, with the original source of the name from the U.S. Census Bureau. Residents of the area are gradually picking up the term.

West Hattiesburg should not be confused with Oak Grove, which is directly to the west but considered its own area. This can be complicated because public school students in West Hattiesburg are still enrolled in Oak Grove’s school system.

==Roads==
Two major highways pass near West Hattiesburg. Interstate 59 forms the eastern border of the community, and U.S. Highway 98 passes just north of the current CDP, through land annexed by the city of Hattiesburg. Due to recent population growth and migration the area (and Lamar County) the traffic has gotten worse on Highway 98, which has led to Highway 98 being widened from 4 to 6 lanes and recently 4 to 8 lanes (only near Interstate 59) in the area. Three major roads parallel U.S. Highway 98 (4th Street, Oak Grove Road, and Lincoln Road) have also been victim to large inflows of traffic due to the large amount of motorists trying to avoid major traffic on 98.

==Education==
The Lamar County School District serves West Hattiesburg, via the schools in the Oak Grove area. There have been calls, however, for the district to build West Hattiesburg its own schools due to overpopulation.

===High school===
* Oak Grove High School (Grades 9-12)

===Middle school===
* Oak Grove Middle School (Grades 6-8)

===Elementary schools===
* Oak Grove Upper Elementary School (Grades 4-5)
* Oak Grove Lower Elementary School (Grades 2-3)
* Long Leaf Elementary School (Grades K-5)
* Oak Grove Primary School (Grades K-1)

<text>Landaff is a town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town population was 446.

== History ==
The name on the town charter is &quot;Llandaff&quot;, after the Bishop of Llandaff, chaplain to England&#x27;s King George III. Originally, however, the land was granted as &quot;Whitcherville&quot; to James Avery and 60 others on January 31, 1764. But those settlers forfeited their grant by failure to comply with the requirements of the charter, so the territory was re-granted to Dartmouth College on January 19, 1770.

Settlements were made under the Dartmouth grant. Roads and a mill were built at the expense of the college, and on November 11, 1774, the town was incorporated. After the Revolutionary War, however, the first grantees successfully claimed that their forfeiture was illegal, so the college had to abandon its title and lose what it had expended in making the settlements.

Landaff was originally much larger than today. It was changed by legislative actions over the years:

* On July 2, 1845, it gained a small tract from the then-adjoining town of Lincoln.
* On June 23, 1859, all of Landaff lying northwest of the Ammonoosuc River was annexed to the town of Lisbon.
* On July 20, 1876, the town was divided, with the eastern half becoming the town of Easton.

The Lisbon Area Historical Society promotes the public&#x27;s interest in and appreciation for the towns of Lisbon, Landaff and Lyman, and maintains the collection, preservation and cataloging of materials which establish or illustrate the history of the three towns, their indigenous history and heritage, their exploration, settlement and development, as well as their cultural and artistic heritage.

<text>Lebanon ( ) is the only city in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 14,282 at the 2020 census, up from 13,151 at the 2010 census. Lebanon is in western New Hampshire, south of Hanover, near the Connecticut River. It is the home to Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center and Dartmouth College&#x27;s Geisel School of Medicine, together comprising the largest medical facility between Boston, Massachusetts, and Burlington, Vermont.

Lebanon is a core city of the Lebanon–Claremont micropolitan area, comprising four counties in the upper Connecticut River valley, two in New Hampshire and two in Vermont.

== History ==
Lebanon was chartered as a town by colonial governor Benning Wentworth on July 4, 1761, one of 16 along the Connecticut River. It was named for Lebanon, Connecticut, from where many early settlers had come or would come, including the Rev. Eleazar Wheelock, who arrived in 1770 and founded Dartmouth College. Lebanon, Connecticut, was the original home of Moor&#x27;s Charity School, the antecedent of Dartmouth College.

Early settlement concentrated along the Connecticut River in what is now West Lebanon, and in the Mascoma Lake region near Enfield. In the mid-19th century, a mill district developed at falls on the Mascoma River. Industries included, at various times, furniture mills, a tannery, several machine shops, a woolen textile mill, and a clothing factory. In the mid-19th century, this district attracted many French workers from Canada&#x27;s Quebec province. This became the center of town, although West Lebanon grew into a railroad hub with a separate identity after lines entered from Boston. This rail center would become known as &quot;Westboro&quot; after two trains collided when West Lebanon was mistaken for Lebanon.

The mill district, like the railroad, declined into the 1950s and 1960s. The town suffered two major fires; the second, in 1964, destroyed a large portion of the old mill district. Reconstruction resulted in a controversial urban renewal project featuring a closed-off district, called The Mall, built to replace the destroyed Hanover Street area. Partly in defiance of economic decline, and partly to counter a movement by West Lebanon to declare itself an independent town, Lebanon re-incorporated as a city in 1958.

The routing of Interstates 89 and 91 through Lebanon and nearby White River Junction, Vermont, in addition to the growth of Dartmouth College, led to the area&#x27;s economic revival. The former mill town now has a mixed economy based on education, medical services, high-technology and retail. Just south of the village of West Lebanon, a major shopping district has sprung up at the intersection of Route 12A and I-89. Lebanon has undertaken improvements to its recreational facilities, including miles of hiking trails, a municipal ski area, a swimming pool and several sports fields.

In 1991, the Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center, along with most departments of Dartmouth Medical School, moved from Hanover to a new campus just south of the Lebanon-Hanover town line. A number of medical and high-tech firms have located facilities near the medical center campus. TomTom, a leading worldwide developer of mapping databases, has its North American headquarters in Lebanon. Novo Nordisk and Microsoft also have major facilities here.
==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 2.35% of the city.

The city is fully within the Connecticut River watershed. The southern end of Moose Mountain is in the northeast. The highest point in Lebanon is the northern end of Shaker Mountain, at above sea level, on the eastern border of the city.

Also downtown, the Alliance for the Visual Arts (AVA) offers classes in arts and crafts in a LEED-certified former factory building, which houses a ground floor gallery space. Many departments of Dartmouth College&#x27;s Geisel School of Medicine are additionally located just north of downtown at Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center.

==Transportation==

===Roads and highways===

Lebanon is served by Interstate 89, which meets Interstate 91 just across the Connecticut River in White River Junction. It is southeast along I-89 to Concord, the state capital, and northwest along I-89 to Montpelier, the capital of Vermont. U.S. Route 4 passes east–west through the centers of Lebanon and West Lebanon, leading east to Enfield and eventually Concord, and west towards Rutland, Vermont. New Hampshire Route 10 leads south from Lebanon along Interstate 89, eventually diverging to go to Newport. Route 10 leads north from West Lebanon into Hanover and points north along the Connecticut River. New Hampshire Route 120 passes north–south through downtown Lebanon, leading north into Hanover and south to Claremont. New Hampshire Route 12A begins in West Lebanon and heads south along the Connecticut River to Claremont. Near the eastern border of the city, New Hampshire Route 4A leaves US 4 to travel southeast towards Wilmot and central New Hampshire.

===Public transportation===
Lebanon Airport, adjacent to West Lebanon, has passenger service to Boston and New York City provided by Cape Air. Free public bus service for the major towns in the area including Lebanon is provided by Advance Transit, with weekday service to destinations such as Dartmouth–Hitchcock Medical Center, shopping plazas in West Lebanon, the villages of Lebanon and West Lebanon, as well as Hanover and White River Junction. Southeast Vermont Transit also provides a peak direction commuter bus route between DHMC to Bellows Falls, Vermont that also runs on weekdays.

The closest Greyhound bus terminal and Amtrak train station are both located in White River Junction, Vermont. Dartmouth Coach offers daily express bus service to Boston&#x27;s Logan Airport and to New York City.

== Culture ==
Downtown Lebanon is a cultural hub with attractions such as the Lebanon Opera House (in City Hall), the AVA Gallery, seasonal Farmers&#x27; Market and summer concerts on the green. Opera North, based in the city, is the region&#x27;s oldest professional opera company.

Lebanon Public Library, located downtown on East Park Street, is the primary library in the city, and the Kilton Public Library branch serves West Lebanon. Kilton was the first library in the U.S. to host a node of the Tor anonymity network.

The Carter Community Building Association (CCBA) operates an after-school activity center for primary school children and a fitness center for teens and adults. Salt Hill Pub frequently features live musical performances.

== Colburn Park ==
The Colburn Park Historic District is at the heart of Lebanon, consisting of Colburn Park and buildings around it—and many 19th-century buildings immediately adjacent to these. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. The land that later developed into the park was donated in 1792 by Robert Colburn as the site for the community&#x27;s meeting house, serving the purposes of church and town hall. Arterial roads were built to the area, and it began to develop as a commercial and civic center in the early 19th century. A weekly farmers&#x27; market is held there between June and September along with many community activities throughout the year.

<doc id="124692" wikidata="Q986376" url="?curid=124692" title="Greenwood, Mississippi">
<text>Greenwood is a city in and the county seat of Leflore County, Mississippi, United States, located at the eastern edge of the Mississippi Delta region, approximately 96 miles north of the state capital, Jackson, and 130 miles south of the riverport of Memphis, Tennessee. It was a center of cotton planter culture in the 19th century.

The population was 15,205 at the 2010 census. It is the principal city of the Greenwood Micropolitan Statistical Area. Greenwood developed at the confluence of the Tallahatchie and the Yalobusha rivers, which form the Yazoo River.

==History==

===European settlement===
The first Euro-American settlement on the banks of the Yazoo River was a trading post founded in 1834 by Colonel Dr. John J. Dilliard and known as Dilliard&#x27;s Landing. The settlement had competition from Greenwood Leflore&#x27;s rival landing called Point Leflore, located three miles up the Yazoo River. The rivalry ended when Captain James Dilliard donated parcels in exchange for a commitment from the townsmen to maintain an all-weather turnpike to the hill section to the east, along with a stagecoach road to the more established settlements to the northwest.

The settlement was incorporated as &quot;Greenwood&quot; in 1844, named after Chief Greenwood LeFlore. The success of the city, founded during a strong international demand for cotton, was based on its strategic location in the heart of the Delta: on the easternmost point of the alluvial plain, and astride the Tallahatchie and Yazoo rivers. The city served as a shipping point for cotton to major markets in New Orleans, Vicksburg, Mississippi, Memphis, Tennessee, and St. Louis, Missouri.

The construction of railroads through the area in the 1880s revitalized the city; two rail lines ran to downtown Greenwood close to the Yazoo River, and shortened transportation to markets. Greenwood again emerged as a prime shipping point for cotton. Downtown&#x27;s Front Street, bordering the Yazoo, was dominated by cotton factors and related businesses, earning that section the name &quot;Cotton Row&quot;.

===20th century===
The city continued to prosper well into the 1940s. Cotton production suffered in Mississippi during the infestation of the boll weevil in the early 20th century; however, for many years the bridge over the Yazoo displayed the sign &quot;World&#x27;s Largest Inland Long Staple Cotton Market&quot;.

Cotton cultivation and processing became largely mechanized in the first half of the 20th century, displacing thousands of sharecroppers and tenant farmers. Since the late 20th century, some Mississippi farmers have begun to replace cotton with corn and soybeans as commodity crops; with the textile manufacturing industry having shifted overseas, farmers can gain stronger prices for the newer crops, used mostly as animal feed.

Greenwood&#x27;s Grand Boulevard was once named one of America&#x27;s 10 most beautiful streets by the U.S. Chambers of Commerce and the Garden Clubs of America. Sally Humphreys Gwin, a charter member of the Greenwood Garden Club, planted the 1,000 oak trees that line Grand Boulevard. In 1950, Gwin received a citation from the National Congress of the Daughters of the American Revolution in recognition of her work in the conservation of trees.

==Geography==

==Arts and culture==
===Mississippi Blues Trail markers===
Radio station WGRM on Howard Street was the location of B.B. King&#x27;s first live broadcast in 1940. On Sunday nights, King performed live gospel music as part of a quartet. In memory of this event, the Mississippi Blues Trail has placed its third historic marker in this town at the site of the former radio station.
Another Mississippi Blues Trail marker is placed near the grave of the blues singer Robert Johnson. A third Blues Trail marker notes the Elks Lodge in the city, which was an important black organization. A fourth Blues Trail marker was dedicated to Hubert Sumlin that is located along the Yazoo River on River Road.

Greenwood is governed under a city council form of government, composed of council members elected from seven single-member wards and headed by a mayor, who is elected at-large.

==Education==
Greenwood Leflore Consolidated School District (GLCSD) operates public schools. Previously the majority of the city was in Greenwood Public School District while small portions were in the Leflore County School District. These two districts consolidated into GLCSD on July 1, 2019. Greenwood High School is the only public high school in Greenwood. As of 2014, the student body is 99% black. Amanda Elzy High School, outside of the Greenwood city limits, was formerly of the Leflore County district. It was recently taken over by the State of Mississippi for poor performance as a result of deficient leadership.

Pillow Academy, a private school, is located in unincorporated Leflore County, near Greenwood.

Delta Streets Academy, a newly founded private school located in downtown Greenwood, has an enrollment of nearly 50 students. It has continued to increase enrollment.

St. Francis Catholic School, run by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Jackson, provides classes from kindergarten through sixth grade.

In addition, North New Summit School provides educational services for special-needs and at-risk children from kindergarten through high school.

<text>Brookhaven is a city in Lincoln County, Mississippi, United States, south of the state capital of Jackson. The population was 11,674 people at the 2020 U.S. Census. It is the county seat of Lincoln County. It was named after the town of Brookhaven, New York, by founder Samuel Jayne in 1818.

==History==

Brookhaven is located in what was formerly territory of the Choctaw. The city was founded in 1818 by Samuel Jayne from New York, who named it after the town of Brookhaven on Long Island. Most of the Choctaw were forced out of Mississippi in the 1830s under Indian Removal, and were given lesser land in Indian Territory.

The railroad was constructed through Brookhaven in 1858. It connected Brookhaven with New Orleans to the south and Memphis to the north.

During the Civil War, Brookhaven was briefly occupied at noon on April 29, 1863, by a raiding party of Union cavalry under the command of Colonel Benjamin Grierson. The Union force burned public buildings and destroyed the railroad. This was rebuilt after the war.

In 1908, a mob of 2,000 White people assaulted a military guard and kidnapped a Black man, Eli Pigot, and murdered him in broad daylight. 
In 1936 Brookhaven was chosen as the site of the Stahl-Urban garment plant.

In 1955, Lamar Smith, a black farmer and World War I veteran, was shot to death by whites mid-day on the lawn of the county courthouse in Brookhaven. He had been working to organize voter registration among blacks, who had been largely disenfranchised in the state since 1890 by barriers created by whites. After World War II, Smith was among the many veterans who became activists for civil rights, determined to regain their constitutional rights. Nobody was prosecuted for his murder.

In 2022, D&#x27;Monterrio Gibson, a black FedEx driver was chased down and shot at by two white men after Gibson had delivered a package to an incorrect address and then retrieved it.

==Geography==
Brookhaven is in central Lincoln County. I-55 passes through the west side of the city, with access from Exits 38, 40, and 42. I-55 leads north to Jackson, the state capital, and south to Hammond, Louisiana. US 51 runs parallel to I-55, passing through the west side of Brookhaven closer to the city center. US-51 leads north to Hazlehurst and south to McComb. US 84 passes through the south side of Brookhaven, leading east to Prentiss and west to Natchez.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.41%, are water. The city expanded in late 2007 to almost triple its previous area, through a vote of annexation, to bring in suburban developments surrounding the older town and equalize taxing and services provided to the new metropolitan area.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===

As of the 2020 United States census, there were 11,674 people, 4,346 households, and 2,827 families residing in the city.

===2010 census===
As of the 2010 census, there were 12,513 people, 4,768 households, and 3,146 families residing in the city of Brookhaven. The population density was . There were 5,519 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was fairly evenly split with 43.8% White, 54.1% African American, 0.1% Native American, 0.7% Asian, 0.2% from other races, and 1.0% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.9% of the population.

There were 4,768 households, out of which 34.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 37.7% were married couples living together, 24.3% had a female householder with no husband present, and 34.0% were non-families. 30.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.48 and the average family size was 3.10.

==Arts and culture==
Brookhaven&#x27;s Temple B&#x27;nai Shalom is an example of Moorish Revival architecture.

==Education==
The city is served by the Brookhaven School District of public schools. Up until 1970, separate systems were maintained for black students and white schools. When Brown v. Board required integration of schools in 1954, white citizens refused. In 1970, when the state finally capitulated and desegregated public schools, a private school, Brookhaven Academy, was created to allow white parents to keep their children from attending schools with black children.

In 1988, Brookhaven High School hired a football coach, Hollis Rutter, from Brookhaven Academy. This so upset the black population, who felt that this was a racially-insensitive move, that a school boycott ensued, ultimately resulting in the rescission of Rutter&#x27;s hiring. This school again came into the spotlight in 2018 when it became known that Cindy Hyde-Smith, a candidate for U.S. Senate known for making racially-incendiary statements, sent her daughter to this school.

The statewide magnet high school, the Mississippi School of the Arts is also located in the city. Four Lincoln County public schools are also located in Brookhaven&#x27;s rural areas: Bogue Chitto Attendance Center, Enterprise Attendance Center, Loyd Star Attendance Center and West Lincoln Attendance Center. The former institution of higher learning Whitworth Female College, founded in 1858, was located in Brookhaven. The all-girls college closed its doors in 1984.

In 2019, it was reported that the school district still &quot;has largely segregated classrooms – some all-black, some majority white.&quot;

==Media==
Brookhaven is a part of the Jackson, Mississippi television market, including news stations WLBT, WJTV, WAPT, and WDBD. The city is served by a daily newspaper called &quot;The Daily Leader&quot;.

==Infrastructure==

===Roads===

Brookhaven contains Interstate 55 and U.S. Route 51, which run parallel to each other going north-south, and U.S. Route 84, which runs east-west.

===Rail transportation===

Amtrak&#x27;s famous &quot;City of New Orleans&quot; (subject of the song ballad written by Steve Goodman and recorded by folk singer Arlo Guthrie in 1972) serves Brookhaven, going north and south on the old Illinois Central and Gulf, Mobile and Ohio railroad lines.

<doc id="124695" wikidata="Q5558066" url="?curid=124695" title="Livermore, New Hampshire">
<text>Livermore is an unincorporated civil township and ghost town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. It was briefly inhabited as a logging town in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The site of the former village is approximately west of North Conway, about off U.S. Route 302 (the Crawford Notch Highway) via the U.S. Forest Service Sawyer River Road. The logging operation was established by Daniel Saunders Jr. and Charles W. Saunders, members of the Saunders family. The town was named for Samuel Livermore, a former United States senator who was the grandfather of Daniel Saunders&#x27; wife. The population was reported as two at the 2020 census.

== Geography ==
Livermore is in the White Mountains region of northern New Hampshire, along the eastern border of Grafton County. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and , or 0.26%, is water. Nearly all of the town&#x27;s area (99.7%) is part of the White Mountain National Forest.

To the south is Waterville Valley, to the north and west is Lincoln (and a southern tip of Bethlehem), and to the east are Hart&#x27;s Location, Bartlett and the northwestern corner of Albany.

The village of Livermore was benchmarked with an elevation of , a quarter mile from the eastern boundary adjoining Hart&#x27;s Location.

Livermore is a long, relatively narrow township, forming a very rough approximation of a crescent with its endpoints at the north and west. Livermore and its neighbor to the west, Lincoln, occupy a large area of uninhabited woodland once known as the &quot;Pemigewasset Wilderness&quot; (a portion of which is preserved in the present-day WMNF Pemigewasset Wilderness in Lincoln). The original boundary between the two towns did not follow natural features, such as the crest of the divide that separates the Pemigewasset River and Saco River drainages, which led to numerous charges and countercharges of cutting over the line between the two owners, the Saunders family in Livermore and James Everell Henry in Lincoln. In addition, it was difficult to haul timber over the ridgecrest. Eventually a settlement was reached by which the New Hampshire legislature redrew the town boundary to run along the ridgecrest, with the Lincoln portion defined as that part of the territory that is drained by the East Branch of the Pemigewasset River and the Livermore portion as that drained by other rivers. This definition produced a peculiar result: there is a small piece of Livermore at the head of the Little River valley (part of the Ammonoosuc River drainage) that is not contiguous to the rest of the town - it is, in fact, from the nearest corner of the main part of the town and, therefore, forms an exclave. Since this fragment and all lands bordering it are now part of the White Mountain National Forest, this historical peculiarity no longer has any practical consequences.

The curving northwestern border of the township follows the height of land between the drainage of the East Branch of the Pemigewasset River to the west and the headwaters of the Sawyer River and the Swift River to the east, as well as tributaries of the Pemigewasset River to the south. Important summits along the border (from northeast to southwest) include Mount Bemis, at above sea level; Mount Lowell, at ; Mount Carrigain, the highest point in Livermore at ; Mount Kancamagus, at ; and Mount Osceola, at .

Two roads cross the township of Livermore, although neither one is close to the site of Livermore village. The Kancamagus Highway (New Hampshire Route 112) crosses Kancamagus Pass () on the Lincoln/Livermore boundary and passes through several miles of the southeastern part of Livermore to a point just west of Sabbaday Falls. The Tripoli Road (not usually maintained for winter travel), which runs from the northern tip of Thornton through Thornton Gap to Waterville Valley, crosses the southwest corner of the township.

== Demographics ==

As of the census of 2020, there were two people living in the township.

Historical census figures are shown in the adjacent table. As a logging town where most of the actual logging was done in the winter by transient men hired for the season only, ascertaining the actual population of Livermore at any given time would have been problematic, and these census figures may have been influenced by how these transients were counted.

* 1965 - Robert Shackford burns down the Saunders mansion after getting tired of constant vandalism and destruction of the property.
* 1970s - Bill defeated in State House for Lincoln to annex Livermore.

Diatomaceous earth—also called tripolite—was once mined in Little East Pond and processed in a mill located in the southwestern part of Livermore township. The Tripoli Road received its name from this mill. The USFS Little East Pond Trail follows for some distance the grade of the old railroad that served the mill, and the ruins of the mill can still be found by following the line of the railroad grade into the woods for a short distance. However, this mill was far from the village of Livermore and was historically more identified with Thornton.

<doc id="124703" wikidata="Q2418021" url="?curid=124703" title="Lyme, New Hampshire">
<text>Lyme is a town along the Connecticut River in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,745 as of the 2020 census. Lyme is home to the Chaffee Natural Conservation Area. The Dartmouth Skiway is in the eastern part of town, near the village of Lyme Center. The Appalachian Trail passes through the town&#x27;s heavily wooded eastern end.

==History==

This was once a home to Abenaki Indians, including a band of Sokokis near Post Pond at a place they called &quot;Ordanakis&quot;. Later, it would be among the many towns granted by colonial Governor Benning Wentworth along the Connecticut River in 1761. Many of the 63 grantees lived in Massachusetts and Connecticut, but virtually none of them ever settled in Lyme, and they instead sold or assigned their grants to others. However, those settlers who did arrive in 1764 were mostly from those states. The town encompasses land that, prior to the Lyme&#x27;s founding, was called Tinkertown. In the late 1770s, Lyme petitioned (ultimately unsuccessfully) to join Vermont.

The scenic town common is surrounded with houses and public buildings dating from the late 1700s to the early 1900s. Stagecoaches traveling the old &quot;Boston Turnpike&quot; from Montreal in the 1830s passed through Lyme, stopping at the Lyme Inn, built in 1809 and recently renovated. Next door to the inn is the 200-year-old Congregational church. Its original 1815 steeple bell was cast by Paul Revere. It was later replaced with a bell cast by Henry N. Cooper &amp; Co., Boston. A hand-wound clock mechanism from E. Howard &amp; Co. strikes the hour. Behind the church is a row of horse sheds dating from 1810. The row of 27 sheds standing today is the longest line of contiguous horse sheds in New England, and possibly in the United States. Originally each shed had the name of the owner on a sign above the door. The signs are still there, though not necessarily over the original shed.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 2.19% of the town. Lyme is drained by Hewes, Grant, and Clay brooks, all flowing to the Connecticut River, which forms the western boundary of the town and the state border with Vermont.

The Lyme Common occupies the center of the village of Lyme, located about east of the Connecticut River.

Lyme is a rural town. Most human development is in the western half of the town along the Connecticut River and New Hampshire Route 10, known as the Dartmouth College Highway. The eastern half of the town is mostly forest. The town is home to four great ponds: Post Pond, Pout Pond, Trout Pond, and Reservoir Pond. Holts Ledge is a cliff that faces east and is part of the Dartmouth Skiway. The edge of the cliff is fenced to protect falcons. The highest point in town is the summit of Smarts Mountain, at above sea level. A fire tower, which was built in 1915, is visible from miles away atop Smarts Mountain and sets it apart from other local mountains. The Appalachian Trail crosses the summits of Holts Ledge and Smarts Mountain.

The school typically ranks in the top 5–10% of New Hampshire schools. Once a pupil reaches ninth grade, students from Lyme attend one of several high schools: Thetford Academy in Thetford, Vermont (across the Connecticut River), Hanover High School in Hanover, New Hampshire (about 10 miles south of Lyme), Hartford High School in Hartford, Vermont, Lebanon High School in Lebanon, New Hampshire, or St. Johnsbury Academy in St. Johnsbury, Vermont. Attendance is typically split between St. Johnsbury Academy, Thetford Academy and Hanover High, with the few remaining students going elsewhere.

Crossroads Academy, founded in 1991 as a K–8 school in Hanover, is now located on a wooded campus at 95 Dartmouth College Highway in Lyme. It serves more than 140 students from a 50-mile radius in grades K–8 and employs 39 faculty and staff.

<text>Monroe is a town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 864 at the 2020 census, up from 788 at the 2010 census. The town is located along the Connecticut River, across from Barnet, Vermont. It was originally chartered as part of Lyman.

== History ==

In 1762, colonial Governor John Wentworth issued a grant (&quot;Number 11&quot;) to 64 persons obligated to clear, farm and settle one tenth of each of their parcels or forfeit the grant. Only two made the attempt, but the charter was extended, in 1769, for another five years. Eleven of the original 64 grantees were named Lyman. In that same year, Wentworth also granted to one Colonel John Hurd of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, part of the land which is today within the bounds of Monroe. The grant was named &quot;Hurd&#x27;s Location&quot; and included five small islands in the Connecticut River, known as &quot;Deer Islands&quot;, and a parcel of land from below the present Village Bridge to the foot of Fifteen Mile Falls.

In addition to Hurd&#x27;s Location and the governor&#x27;s , there were 23 lots of the 64 portions of Lyman located in &quot;West Lyman&quot;, or the &quot;Lyman Plain&quot;, now Monroe, making up less than of the present area. portion of Bath, to the south, was annexed in 1897.

The first known settlers on the &quot;West Lyman&quot; portion of Lyman were John Hyndman (also, &quot;John Hinman&quot;), with his wife and son, who settled on the largest of the Deer Islands (below the present-day Barnet Bridge) in 1784 and built a log cabin. When Colonel Hurd learned of Hyndman&#x27;s structure, he sued to have him evicted. A Barnet benefactor settled the controversy by purchasing the title from Hurd.

The first permanent settlers also came in the 1780s. They were the Olmstead families: Joseph, Timothy, and Israel, their wives and children. The first native son, Ethan Smith, was born in a cabin on the Canaan Road (over the Gardner Mountain to Lyman) in 1784.

Because of the difficulty traversing the steep &quot;Gardner&#x27;s Mountain&quot; running north to south through the original Lyman grant of 1761, the settlers of the western portion had different priorities and needs than the rest of Lyman to the east. Monroe was incorporated as a separate town in 1854. After appropriate consideration, it was named after President James Monroe. In 1860, Monroe had 619 residents. By 1880, the population had decreased to 504.

&quot;Captain&quot; Phillip Paddleford, a Revolutionary War soldier, settled in 1790, and built Monroe&#x27;s first sawmill and gristmill on what is now called Smith Brook. Peter Paddleford (1785–1859) was the inventor of the wooden Paddleford Truss for covered bridges. Many of his original bridges still stand. He was the builder of the &quot;third Lyman Bridge&quot; from Monroe to McIndoes, Vermont, in 1833, after the 1826 floods had taken out all bridges on the Connecticut River. It was a covered bridge of pine, over long, and stood for over 96 years, making it one of the oldest on the river.

== Geology ==

Parts of the Ammonoosuc Gold Fields, which have never been successfully mined, are in Monroe. &quot;Within the limits of the town are the narrows, at which place the Connecticut River is only five rods in width, being confined by walls of slate.&quot; Several copper mines were excavated along the &quot;Back Road&quot; (now named Coppermine Road), and many parcels continue to have separate mining rights.

Test borings and surface samples during the 1928–1930 construction of Frank D. Comerford Dam, in the Connecticut River, provided new geologic information regarding de-glaciation of the White Mountains, and became the namesake of the &quot;Comerford Suite&quot;. The dam, located on what was once called &quot;Fifteen Mile Falls&quot;, is now used for flood control, irrigation and generation of electrical power for transmission to New England states. At the time of its construction, it was the largest &quot;retaining wall&quot; in the United States, representing more than of concrete.

Prior to the establishment of a series of dams, the river dropped in , from Dalton to Bath.

== Geography ==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 6.26% of the town. The town is bounded by the Connecticut River (which is also the state boundary with Vermont) to its west and the long ridge of Gardner Mountain to the east. Signal Mountain, a knob on Gardner Mountain, is the highest point in Monroe, measuring above sea level. It has long been a major surveying reference point for maps and plats of the area between Mount Mansfield and Mount Washington.

NH 135 runs through the town, substantially parallel to the river, linking Monroe to Littleton to the north and Bath to the south. A northwestern segment of Bath was annexed to Monroe in 1895, stimulated by its shared geography with Monroe.

== History ==

Orange was granted in 1769 and incorporated in 1790. It was originally named &quot;Cardigan&quot;, after George Brudenell, fourth Earl of Cardigan. The Cardigan name lives on with Mount Cardigan and Cardigan Mountain State Park. After the American Revolution, voters attempted to rename the town &quot;Bradford&quot;, &quot;Middletown&quot;, &quot;Liscomb&quot;, and finally &quot;Orange&quot;. The large quantities of yellow-orange ochre found in Mount Cardigan may have been the source of the name Orange.

The western side of the town (and the mountain) drains via Orange Brook to the Indian River in the neighboring town of Canaan, in turn a tributary of the Mascoma River. This portion of town is part of the Connecticut River watershed. The remainder of the town is part of the Merrimack River watershed. In the northern part of town, the South Branch of the Baker River has its source, flowing north toward Groton and Dorchester. The northeastern corner of the town drains north via Atwell Brook to the Cockermouth River in Groton, a tributary of Newfound Lake. The eastern edge of town drains off Mount Cardigan via several brooks leading to the Fowler River in Alexandria, another tributary of Newfound Lake. The southeastern part of town drains to Mill Brook, a southward-flowing tributary of the Smith River.

<text>Taylorsville is a town located in southeastern Smith County, Mississippi, United States. The population was 1,148 at the 2020 census. It is the most populous community in Smith County.

==History==

Taylorsville was established on the Gulf and Ship Island Railroad in 1900. The site was selected by an employee of the railroad, and soon after a post office was built. The post office was originally located about five miles away in Old Taylorsville (now a community located off of Mississippi Highway 531), but was later moved to New Taylorsville. It was the moving of the post office to New Taylorsville that established the present location of the town.

Soon after, the Old Stringer Hotel was built. Many years later, in 1946, it was burned down in an arson fire. The town of Taylorsville was founded as a result of the extensive pine forests that grow in Smith County and the surrounding areas. The vast majority of the area was cut by Eastman-Gardiner. As lumber was a very plentiful resource, new businesses and homes both were rapidly built.

There are a variety of industries present in Taylorsville, including lumber, manufacturing, signage, agriculture, and finance. Taylorsville is the headquarters of Southern Pine Electric, an electric co-op chartered in March 1938 to serve 481 homes and farms. Today, Southern Pine Electric is one of the largest electric cooperatives in the United States with nearly 10,000 miles of energized line serving more than 65,000 meters. The 11-county service area encompasses 14.3% of the total land mass of Mississippi.

<doc id="124710" wikidata="Q934408" url="?curid=124710" title="Orford, New Hampshire">
<text>Orford is a town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,237 at the 2020 census, unchanged from the 2010 census. The Appalachian Trail crosses in the east.

==History==
First called &quot;Number Seven&quot; in a line of Connecticut River fort towns, Orford was incorporated in 1761 by Governor Benning Wentworth and named for Robert Walpole, Earl of Orford, who was the first prime minister of Great Britain. The town was settled in 1765 by Daniel Cross and wife from Lebanon, Connecticut. By 1859, it had 1,406 inhabitants, most involved in agriculture. There was a large tannery, a chair factory, ten sawmills, a starch factory, a gristmill, a sash, blind and door factory, and two boot and shoe factories.

An original grantee was General Israel Morey, whose son Samuel Morey discovered a way to separate hydrogen from oxygen in water, making possible the first marine steam engine. He recognized the potential of steam power after working at his father&#x27;s ferry. In 1793, on the river at Orford, he was first to demonstrate the use of a paddlewheel to propel a steam boat.

Author Washington Irving visited Orford in 1832 and is quoted as saying, &quot;In all my travels in this country and in Europe, I have seen no village more beautiful than this. It is a charming place—nature has done her utmost here.&quot; Of the famous sequence of seven early homes built on The Ridge, Dartmouth Professor of Architecture Hugh Morrison said, &quot;As a row and counting the setting, this is the finest group of Federal-style houses in the United States.&quot; Built between 1773 and 1839, the dwellings show the influence of architect Asher Benjamin.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 2.93% of the town. The Connecticut River, which serves as the boundary between New Hampshire and Vermont, forms the western edge of the town. Most of Orford is drained by Jacobs Brook and other small tributaries of the Connecticut. The northeastern corner of the town, around Upper and Lower Baker Ponds, drains via the Baker River and Pemigewasset River into the Merrimack River.

The town has two population centers. The main village of Orford, with the town&#x27;s schools and post office, is located on New Hampshire Route 10 along the banks of the Connecticut River. The town hall, however, is located in the smaller village of Orfordville, on New Hampshire Route 25A several miles east of the river.

The highest point in Orford is the summit of Mount Cube, at above sea level, in the eastern part of town. The northern slopes of Smarts Mountain, whose summit lies in the neighboring town of Lyme, occupy the southeastern corner of town.

Camps Merriwood and Moosilauke are situated on Upper Baker Pond in Orford.

<text>Indianola is a city in and the county seat of Sunflower County, Mississippi, United States, in the Mississippi Delta. The population was 10,683 at the 2010 census.

==History==
In 1891, Minnie M. Cox was appointed postmaster of Indianola, becoming the first black female postmaster in the United States. Her rank was raised from fourth class to third class in 1900, and she was appointed to a full four-year term. Cox&#x27;s position was one of the most respected and lucrative public posts in Indianola, as it served approximately 3,000 patrons and paid $1,100 annually, then a large sum. White resentment to Cox&#x27;s prestigious position began to grow, and in 1902 some white residents in Indianola drew up a petition requesting Cox&#x27;s resignation. James K. Vardaman, editor of &quot;The Greenwood Commonwealth&quot; and a white supremacist, began delivering speeches reproaching the people of Indianola for &quot;tolerating a negro wench as a postmaster.&quot;

Racial tensions grew, and threats of physical harm led Cox to submit her resignation to take effect on January 1, 1903. The incident attracted national attention, and President Theodore Roosevelt refused to accept her resignation, feeling Cox had been wronged, and the authority of the federal government was being compromised. &quot;Roosevelt stood resolute. Unless Cox&#x27;s detractors could prove a reason for her dismissal other than the color of her skin, she would remain the Indianola postmistress.&quot;

Roosevelt closed Indianola&#x27;s post office on January 2, 1903, and rerouted mail to Greenville; Cox continued to receive her salary. The same month, the United States Senate debated the Indianola postal event for four hours, and Cox left Indianola for her own safety and did not return. In February 1904, the post office was reopened but was demoted in rank from third class to fourth class.

In July 1954, two months after the Supreme Court of the United States announced its unanimous decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education,&quot; ruling that school segregation was unconstitutional, the local plantation manager Robert B. Patterson met with a group of like-minded people in a private home in Indianola to form the White Citizens&#x27; Council.

In May 2023, the police&#x27;s shooting of Aderrien Murry, an 11-year-old, occurred in the city.

==Geography==
Indianola is west of Greenwood.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild to cool winters. According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Indianola has a humid subtropical climate, abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot; on climate maps.

==Demographics==
===2020 census===

As of the 2020 United States Census, there were 9,646 people, 3,483 households, and 2,209 families residing in the city.

===2000 census===

The racial makeup of the city was 25.73% White, 73.38% African American, 0.01% Native American, 0.46% Asian American, 0.16% from other races, and 0.27% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.71% of the population.

==Economy==
Because Indianola is located at the intersection of U.S. Route 49W and U.S. Route 82, as of 2004 it is one of the last economically viable small towns in the Mississippi Delta. In the 1980s and 1990s, the city government convinced a major retailer to build a distribution center near the intersection of the two highways. This development infused cash into the local economy and allowed semiskilled jobs to be established.

In August 2011, Delta Pride, a catfish processing company, closed its plant in Indianola.

== Culture ==
J. Todd Moye, author of &quot;Let the People Decide: Black Freedom and White Resistance Movements in Sunflower County, Mississippi, 1945–1986&quot;, said that &quot;Life in Indianola still moves at a pace established by its distinguishing characteristic, the picturesque and languid Indian Bayou that winds through downtown.&quot;

===Blues===
Indianola is the birthplace of the blues musician Albert King. The blues harp player, Little Arthur Duncan, was born in Indianola in 1934.

B.B. King grew up in Indianola as a child. He came to the blues festival named after him every year. King referenced the city with the title of his 1970 album &quot;Indianola Mississippi Seeds&quot;. The B.B. King Museum and Delta Interpretive Center, a $14 million facility dedicated to King and the blues, opened in September 2008.

==Education==
The Sunflower County Consolidated School District, headquartered in Indianola, operates public schools serving the city. Residents are zoned to Lockard Elementary School (K-2), Carver Elementary School (3-6), Robert L. Merritt Junior High School (7-9), and Gentry High School (10-12). The district operates two other 10-12 schools in the city, Indianola Career and Technical Center and Indianola Academic Achievement Academy.

Indianola Academy, a private school and former segregation academy, is in Indianola. As of 2012 most white teenagers in Indianola attend Indianola Academy instead of the public high schools. Sarah Carr of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; explained that there are two explanations of why the private academies in Indianola and other towns still exist. One says that the public schools suffered from poor leadership and wrongdoing and that the private academies thrive because of the failings of the public schools, and the other says that the white leadership starved the public schools of resources after the academies were enacted, leading to the failings of the public schools.

The Sunflower County Library operates the Henry M. Seymour Library in Indianola, which houses its administrative headquarters.

===History of education===
Prior to the school district merger, the Sunflower County School District had its headquarters in the Sunflower County Courthouse in Indianola. The district&#x27;s educational services building is along U.S. Route 49 West in Indianola.

As of 1996, 90 per cent of students in the Indianola School District were black. Most of the white students who attend Indianola public schools transfer to private schools by junior high school.

The Mississippi Department of Corrections operates a probation and parole office in the Courthouse Annex in Indianola.

The United States Postal Service operates the Indianola Post Office. A mural, entitled &quot;White Gold in the Delta&quot; by WPA Section of Painting and Sculpture artist Beulah Bettersworth, was installed in the post office in 1939. It depicted cotton harvesting scenes. Murals were produced from 1934 to 1943 in the United States through the Section of Painting and Sculpture, later called the Section of Fine Arts, of the U.S. Treasury Department. The original artist Walter Anderson was unable to complete the mural, and Bettersworth was selected. The mural was eventually destroyed. In 2008, the building was named the Minnie Cox Post Office Building by an act of Congress.

<text>Coldwater is a town in Tate County, Mississippi, United States, and is part of the Memphis Metropolitan Area. The population was 1,677 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The town square of Coldwater is approximately two miles south of the Coldwater River, hence the name. The original town began in 1856, called the village of Elm Grove. Construction of the Mississippi and Tennessee Railroad through here in 1858 stimulated development. Rows of stores and other businesses developed on both sides of the tracks, along with houses of worship. Coldwater was officially incorporated in 1872. At that time, the Town was located in DeSoto County and was a mile square, with the railroad depot at the center. The area was developed for cotton plantations and Coldwater became a trading center.

In 1873 during Reconstruction, the legislature organized Tate County from portions of DeSoto, Marshall and Tunica counties. Coldwater fell into the new county. The Town began to grow with an influx of settlers from Virginia, the Carolinas, Alabama, and other areas seeking a better life for themselves and their families. There were 397 residents of Coldwater according to the 1890 census. By 1884, there were 96 small schools in Tate County: 54 white and 42 black. They were mostly one teacher, one-room log houses with split logs for seats.

Coldwater steadily grew in numbers. However, periodic river flooding plagued the town, although it was also the basis of the farmland&#x27;s fertility. The Army Corps of Engineers built the Arkabutla Lake and Dam project along the Coldwater River in the early 1940s. Town residents believed they needed to move and the Town was relocated and reconstructed on land about a mile and a half south of its original location.

The site of the old town of Coldwater is MSL. Parts of it are underwater year round.

Radio station WREC was founded in Coldwater by Hoyt B. Wooten. It broadcast news talk information. The station is now called WREG-TV and broadcasts news on a major news network.

<text>Rumney is a town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,498 at the 2020 census. The town is located at the southern edge of the White Mountain National Forest.

==History==
Rumney was named after Robert Marsham, 2nd Baron Romney (pronounced Rumney). The town was originally granted in 1761 by Governor Benning Wentworth to settlers from Colchester and East Haddam, Connecticut. It was first settled in 1765; however, some grantees failed to comply with the charter, so Rumney was regranted to another group of settlers in 1767.

Farmers found the town&#x27;s soil fertile. By 1859, when the population was 1,109, other industries included fifteen sawmills, a large tannery, and a ladder factory. The Boston, Concord and Montreal Railroad commenced service to West Rumney in 1850–1851.

On December 22, 1954 the Automobile License Plate Collectors Association (ALPCA) was founded at Rumney. The ALPCA has since expanded into an international organization with members in all 50 states and in 19 countries.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 2.15% of the town. The highest point in Rumney is above sea level on the southern slope of Carr Mountain. The Baker River flows from west to east through the center of the town, roughly paralleled by New Hampshire Route 25. The town is part of the Pemigewasset River watershed, leading to the Merrimack River.

The town of Rumney contains several smaller villages. Rumney village, the town&#x27;s central settlement, lies just north of the Baker River. Directly to the south, across the Baker River and adjacent to Route 25, is the village of Rumney Depot. The village of Stinson Lake, comprising development around the lake of the same name and at the foot of adjacent Stinson Mountain, is in the northern corner of the town, and West Rumney is located along Route 25 near the town&#x27;s western border.

Rumney is home to Polar Caves Park, which is well known for its geological views and glowing rock formations. It is located along Route 25 near the town&#x27;s eastern border.

===Rumney Rocks===
Rumney Rocks, located between Rumney village and West Rumney, is a rock climbing destination renowned for its sport climbing routes.

The majority of the climbing is found on the numerous small cliff faces on the south face of Rattlesnake Mountain, much of which lies within the White Mountain National Forest. These cliffs are mostly made of schist, with some being granite, and vary from long smooth slabs to wildly overhung roofs and aretes. They range in height, with most falling between , but a few reach over .

Most climbs are well bolted, with a few requiring additional protection. The climbs range from 5.0 to 5.15a, with the majority of routes falling between 5.10 and 5.12.

<text>Tylertown is a town in and the county seat of Walthall County, Mississippi, United States. This town is fifty-five miles southwest from the Hattiesburg metropolitan area. Its population was 1,609 at the 2010 census.

==History==

The town of Tylertown was first known as the Magee Settlement. It was settled by emigrants of the Magee and Thornhill families, who came from South Carolina. J. Thornhill acquired the first tract of land for the settlement on September 20, 1816, after Native Americans were pushed out of the area. Cullen Conerly went there in 1850 and bought out the Garland Hart store and established a post office which was called Conerly&#x27;s post office. The store and post office served as the social center of the community for over a half century.

The town bore the name Conerly&#x27;s from 1848 to 1879. It was renamed as Tyler Town in honor of William G. Tyler; the name was shortened to one word in 1894. Cullen Conerly sold his mercantile interest to his brother-in-law Benjamin Lampton. He laid the foundation of the mercantile business of Tylertown.
Tylertown was part of Pike County until 1912, when Walthall County was formed from Pike and Marion counties. The &quot;Tylertown Times&quot; (local newspaper) was started in 1907. Tylertown Insurance Agency, Inc. has been serving Tylertown&#x27;s insurance needs since 1924. Luter&#x27;s Supply, established in 1944, is a retail center for tubs, showers, and whirlpools. Jones Furniture opened in 1939. Tylertown&#x27;s oldest pharmacy, Pigott&#x27;s Drug Store, has been around since 1919. WTYL radio station came to Tylertown in 1969.

In interesting story about Tylertown and Walthall County was related in Maury Klein&#x27;s book &quot;A Call to Arms&quot; (Bloomsbury Press, Paperback edition, 2015). It seems that during World War II, the production and growing of food became problematic as both the United States and its allies were in need of great amounts of food. Production was lagging and crops were rotting in the fields for lack of crop pickers - farm laborers either marched off to war or to factories where wages were far superior to those earned picking cotton - and the need for more of everything was needed. Walthall County responded to the call to grow more of everything. The farmers left behind produced what was termed &quot;barn-bursting harvests, including 23 percent more cotton, 146 percent more hay, 110 percent more eggs, and a whopping 619 percent more truck crops. To celebrate, they decided to hold a &quot;Food for Freedom Thanksgiving&quot; early in October in Tylertown (population 1,100) the county seat and only post office&quot;.

According to Klein, the farming crowd came together in Tylertown and came bearing 5,000 fried chickens, 350 turkeys and enough food to feed a small army. Claude Wickard, head of the Food Requirements Committee, appeared in Tylertown that day and extolled the virtues of the small farmer and told them that their endeavors were the &quot;only road that leads to victory&quot;. Klein, p. 449.

<doc id="124718" wikidata="Q2430609" url="?curid=124718" title="Sugar Hill, New Hampshire">
<text>Sugar Hill is a town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 647 at the 2020 census, an increase over the figure of 563 tabulated in 2010. The town overlooks the White Mountain National Forest, with views of the Presidential, Franconia, Kinsman and Dalton ranges. Sugar Hill was incorporated as a town in 1962, the most recent in New Hampshire.

== History ==
Incorporated in 1962 out of the town of Lisbon after considerable litigation, Sugar Hill is the most recently incorporated town in the state. The name &quot;Sugar Hill&quot; comes from the large groves of sugar maples within the town limits.

Offering clean air and panoramic views from atop Sunset Hill Ridge of both the White Mountains and Green Mountains, the community became a fashionable Victorian resort. First attracted by paintings of White Mountain artists, the wealthy arrived by train to escape the heat, humidity and pollution of summers in Boston, Hartford, New York and Philadelphia. Several hostelries were built, including the Hotel Lookoff. But the grandest was the Sunset Hill House, built in 1880 after rail service arrived in neighboring Lisbon Village (Sunset Hill Station). With the longest porch on a single side in New Hampshire, the Second Empire hotel accommodated 350 guests and 300 staff. Patrons found amusement in the casino and bowling alley, or on carriage rides touring nearby Franconia Notch. Built in 1897, the 9-hole Sugar Hill House Golf Course, together with its 1900 clubhouse, are the oldest in the state and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Bobby Jones played the links.

With the advent of automobiles came a decline in grand hotels, however, as tourists were no longer restricted by the limits of rail service. The Sunset Hill House remained open until 1973, longer than many of its type in the region. But it closed at season&#x27;s end, when the furnishings were sold at auction. The aging structure was demolished in 1974, although its annex survived and was purchased in 2013 by new owners, to reopen in 2015 as &quot;The Inn at Sunset Hill&quot;.
=== Peckett&#x27;s-on-Sugar Hill ===

Robert P. Peckett Sr. acquired land on Sugar Hill around 1900 and founded the Peckett&#x27;s-on-Sugar Hill Inn. While hosting winter guests early in the century, the need for increased clientele prompted him, with the assistance of his wife, Katharine Peckett, to establish the first resort-based ski school in the United States. The first two ski instructors were German; they introduced the Arlberg technique developed by Hannes Schneider at St. Anton. In 1931, Sig Buchmayr joined the staff. Kate Peckett brought in several more European instructors including Otto Lang to teach the Arlberg system. Among pupils were Nelson Rockefeller, Averell Harriman, Lowell Thomas, Minot Dole and Roger Peabody. Subsequent efforts by Kate, the CCC and others resulted in the development of the Taft Ski Trail and other facilities on the Cannon Mountain Ski Area.

The French were the first Europeans to assert any territorial rights over the Poplar Bluff area. The French held the area until 1771 when it was ceded by treaty to Spain. Spain held the area until 1802 when it was returned to France. The area that would become Poplar Bluff and Butler County had no permanent European settlement until 1819, when the first white family moved into the area. It was reported that about 300 Native Americans resided in the area at that time.

The earliest permanent settlements in what is now Butler County occurred in the early 19th century along the Natchitoches Trail, an old Native American trail west of what is now Poplar Bluff on Ten Mile Creek and Cane Creek. Butler County was organized in 1849 and Poplar Bluff was chosen as the county seat. In 1855 the first courthouse was built and the town grew.

A tornado leveled most of the city, especially the original business district along Main and Broadway streets, on May 9, 1927. The tornado killed 98 people, tying it as the seventeenth deadliest tornado in U.S. history.

<text>Woodstock is a town in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 1,434 at the 2020 census. Woodstock includes the village of North Woodstock, the commercial center. Its extensive land area is largely forested, and includes the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest. Parts of the White Mountain National Forest are in the east and west. The Appalachian Trail crosses the town&#x27;s northwestern corner. Russell Pond Campground is in the east. West of North Woodstock is the Lost River Reservation.

== History ==
First granted in 1763, colonial Governor Benning Wentworth named the town &quot;Peeling&quot; after an English town. Many of the first colonists were originally from Lebanon, Connecticut. In 1771, his nephew, Governor John Wentworth, gave it the name &quot;Fairfield&quot;, after Fairfield, Connecticut. The town was renamed &quot;Woodstock&quot; in 1840 for Blenheim Palace in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, England, possibly due to the popularity of the 1826 Walter Scott novel &quot;Woodstock&quot;.

Logging became a principal early industry, with sawmills established using water power from the Pemigewasset River. The entrance of the railroad in the 19th century opened the wilderness to development, carrying away wood products to market. It also brought tourists, many attracted by paintings of the region by White Mountain artists. Several inns and hotels were built to accommodate the wealthy, who sought relief from the summer heat, humidity and pollution of coal-age Boston, Hartford, New York and Philadelphia. They often relaxed by taking carriage rides through the White Mountains, or by exploring along the Lost River in the Lost River Reservation. But with the advent of automobiles, patrons were no longer restricted by the limits of rail service. Consequently, many grand hotels established near depots declined and closed. North Woodstock, however, remains a popular tourist destination.

The Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, an outdoor laboratory for ecological studies founded by the United States Forest Service in 1955, is located in the southern part of town.

<text>Holts Summit is a small city in Callaway County, Missouri. The population was 4,458 at the time of the 2020 census. Holts Summit is located northeast of Jefferson City, Missouri&#x27;s state capital. It is part of the Jefferson City Metropolitan Area.

==History==
Most of the pioneers in the early settlements were from the state of Virginia. One among them was Abner Holt who with his family traveled to Howard County, Missouri, in 1819. They settled there for the winter. The men built a house in Callaway County in the unnamed community now known as Holts Summit, and the family settled in during the spring.

In 1870, Holt&#x27;s grandson, Timothy Holt, plotted Holts Summit around a general store built by his father James Holt. They named the village “Holts Summit” because it was the highest point from there to the Missouri River.

“Hibernia Station” was once located across from where North School is now located. The train carried travelers between Hibernia and Holts Summit. Because of declining traffic as autos became more popular, the train depot was torn down in 1934.

Holts Summit was incorporated in 1973.

In the 1960s and 1970s, winemakers began to rebuild the Missouri wine industry. Summit Lake Winery was founded in 2002 in Holts Summit, linking the town to what is called the Missouri Rhineland, the area defined by vineyards along the Missouri River from Callaway County to the western part of St. Charles County.

<text>Lake Mykee Town was a village in Callaway County, Missouri, United States. The village government dissolved on June 1, 2017, and the land area annexed into Holts Summit, Missouri.

Lake Mykee was developed by the Hasselman family on the site of their original farm. &quot;Mykee&quot; is an acronym for the names of their two sons.

The development of Lake Mykee resulted in the relocation of the expansion of Highway 54 east of the lake and dam in the 1970s from the route of Old Highway 54 to the current route in order to provide four lanes without cutting off the subdivision entrance and to avoid the lake.

In 2004, the parcel directly south of Lake Mykee owned by Delbert Payne and his family since 1928 began to be developed into a new, unrelated subdivision named Southwind Meadows. Streets for an initial plat of 24 lots were poured in late 2004 and early 2005 by Stockman Construction and accepted by Callaway County. By the end of 2007, five houses were substantially complete. By the time of the Great recession, houses had been built and occupied on 9 of the 24 lots. Between spring of 2017 and the end of 2019 an additional 10 homes were built. The subdivision has electricity and gas from Ameren, water from Callaway Water District #1, and a dedicated sewer treatment plant maintained by Missouri American Water.

<doc id="124735" wikidata="Q3451003" url="?curid=124735" title="Woodsville, New Hampshire">
<text>Woodsville is a census-designated place (CDP) and the largest village in the town of Haverhill in Grafton County, New Hampshire, United States, along the Connecticut River at the mouth of the Ammonoosuc River. The population was 1,431 at the 2020 census. Although North Haverhill is now the county seat of Grafton County, the village of Woodsville has traditionally been considered the county seat, as the county courthouse was originally located there. The county buildings are now located halfway between Woodsville and the village of North Haverhill to the south.

==History==

Woodsville was named for John L. Woods, a figure in its early development. He arrived from Wells River, Vermont, a village across the Connecticut River narrows in Newbury, and in 1829 purchased a sawmill which had been operating on the Ammonoosuc River since 1811. He manufactured pine lumber, and opened a store in his house. Spring snowmelt carried log drives down the Connecticut and Ammonoosuc rivers. A log boom was built across the Connecticut River to Wells River to hold the logs briefly for sorting. Logs not destined for Woods&#x27; mill were released gradually to avoid jams in the Ox Bow meadow downstream. Log drivers detailed to work at the boom enjoyed Woodsville&#x27;s saloons and red-light district.

The Boston, Concord &amp; Montreal Railroad opened at Woodsville in 1853 and built its division offices and a branch repair shop. It replaced the original 1805 bridge between the states with a two-level span, featuring a toll highway below and railroad tracks on the roof. The village boomed into an important railway town and junction, endowed with fine examples of Victorian architecture. It also became a center for legal affairs. The log drives were stopped after 1915, when pleasure boat owners complained about the hazards to navigation. In 1889, the Grafton County Court moved from Haverhill Corner to Woodsville, where it remained until moving halfway to North Haverhill in 1972.

==Geography==
Woodsville is in the northwest corner of the town of Haverhill, bordered to the north by the town of Bath and to the west by the Connecticut River, which forms the state border with Vermont. According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 1.46%, are water. The Ammonoosuc River runs just north of the CDP and reaches its confluence with the Connecticut River at the northernmost point in the community.

Woodsville is crossed by U.S. Route 302 and by state routes 10 and 135. US 302 leads northeast to Littleton and west across the Connecticut River to Wells River, Vermont, and to Interstate 91. Route 10 leads south from Woodsville to Hanover, and Route 135 leads north to Interstate 93 northwest of Littleton.

Woodsville serves as the commercial center for the town of Haverhill and the surrounding communities, including several just to the west in Vermont. Many of the town&#x27;s commercial businesses, including supermarkets, sit-down and fast-food restaurants, and banks, are located near the junction of US 302 and NH 10. Cottage Hospital, a critical-access hospital serving the area, is also located in Woodsville.

<text>Old Appleton is a village in Cape Girardeau County, Missouri, United States. The population was 73 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Cape Girardeau–Jackson, MO-IL Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Name==
The first settlement was made at Old Appleton in 1824.

The community of Old Appleton was originally known as Apple Creek, named after the stream Apple Creek on which the village is located. By the 1870s the village had become known as Appleton. In 1918, the word &quot;Old&quot; was incorporated into the name to eliminate confusion with Appleton City in St. Clair County, Missouri.

==History==
Although it is not known who the original native inhabitants were of the Old Appleton area, the area eventually become home to the Shawnee and Delaware Indians. Having originated in present-day Delaware and Pennsylvania, the Shawnee and Delaware Indians had been pushed off their lands by white settlement. In the 1780s, Pierre Louis Lorimier, a French Canadian who had worked as an Indian-interpreter for the British, found it in his best interest to leave the American states. He settled Cape Girardeau in the Ste. Genevieve District with his wife, who was of mixed French and Shawnee ancestry. Lorimier was subsequently made the Indian Agent by the Spanish colonial authorities. Like Lorimier, the Shawnee and Delaware Indians had sided with the British, and found themselves in an unsavory situation. Lorimier appealed for land grants from the Spanish authorities for the settlement of Shawnee and Delaware Indians from American territory.

The Spanish granted Lorimier two large tracts of land in the Apple creek watershed, with the intention of the Shawnee and Delaware acting as a buffer against the Osage Indians, who were not on friendly terms with the Spanish authorities. Lorimer then convinced 1,200 Shawnee and 600 Delaware to relocate to the Apple Creek watershed, and in 1784 the group of Shawnee and Delaware migrated and settled down in the area of Old Appleton. The &quot;Le Grand Village Sauvage&quot; was to the west of present-day Old Appleton and the &quot;Petit Village Sauvage&quot; was to the east of Old Appleton. The Shawnee and Delaware villages had a significant amount of racial mixing with the French, and were said to have as much French ancestry as the French had Indian ancestry. Culturally, the Shawnee and Delaware had largely adopted French and American ways and lifestyles, and had built granaries and barns for the storing of their crops and housing of their cattle and horses. The Shawnee and Delaware built their log homes in the French fashion with posts set together and interstices filled with clay, with wood shingled roofs.

In the early 1800s American settlers began encroaching on the Shawnee and Delaware lands around Apple Creek. In 1807 the Shawnee requested protection from the Osage. Although the Americans had agreed to honor Spanish treaties and articles made with local tribes, the treaties were eventually ignored. In 1809, harassment and stealing by American settlers eventually drove the Shawnee and Delaware to visit the territorial governor Meriwether Lewis and pressed their &quot;long-expressed wish&quot; to exchange of their lands in the Apple Creek watershed with lands farther west. The Shawnee and Delaware stayed, but by 1815 the situation had worsened so much that territorial governor William Clark and US president Madison ordered all white intruders removed from Shawnee and Delaware lands. However, this order was largely ignored by the authorities. By 1816, the encroachment by white settlers left the US Federal Government no choice but to relocate the Shawnee and Delaware to lands further west.

In 1824, John McClain and John Schatz established a settlement on Apple Creek known as &quot;Apple Creek&quot;. By the time the post office was established in 1876 the town had become known as Appleton.

Old Appleton was also home to several breweries, among them &quot;The Old Appleton Brewery&quot;, until prohibition forced their closures.

In 1982, a flood on Apple creek destroyed McClain Mill and Old Appleton&#x27;s original bridge. The historic bridge was restored in 2006. The Old Appleton Bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.

<doc id="124737" wikidata="Q2323115" url="?curid=124737" title="Amherst, New Hampshire">
<text>Amherst is a town in Hillsborough County in the state of New Hampshire, United States. The population was 11,753 at the 2020 census. Amherst is home to Ponemah Bog Wildlife Sanctuary, Hodgman State Forest, the Joe English Reservation and Baboosic Lake.

The village of Amherst, where 697 people lived at the 2020 census, is defined as the Amherst census-designated place and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Amherst Village Historic District.

==History==
Like many towns in New England, Amherst was founded via a land grant issued to members of the colonial militia; the land grant which led to the town&#x27;s foundation was issued in 1728 to veterans of King Philip&#x27;s War. A colonial settlement was established at the land grant&#x27;s location five years later in 1733, being initially named &quot;Narragansett Number 3&quot; and later &quot;Souhegan Number 3&quot;. In 1741, the settlement&#x27;s inhabitants established a Congregational church and hired a minister to preach in the settlement. On January 18, 1760, the settlement was chartered by the governor of New Hampshire Benning Wentworth, who renamed it after General Jeffery Amherst, who served as Commander-in-Chief, North America during the French and Indian War. Wentworth chartered Amherst as part of a wave of land grants he issued during the mid-18th century.

In 1770, Amherst became the county seat of Hillsborough County, due largely to its location on the county&#x27;s major east-west road. It continued to prosper through the Revolutionary War and afterwards. In 1790, the southwestern section broke off and became the town of Milford, and in 1803, the northwest section departed to become Mont Vernon. The development of water-powered mills allowed Milford to grow at Amherst&#x27;s expense, and the county seat was moved to Milford in 1866.

The town population remained relatively stagnant until after World War II, when Amherst and many surrounding towns saw an influx of newcomers as the town became part of the Greater Boston region.

Franklin Pierce, who later become the 14th President of the United States studied under Judge Edmund Parker in Amherst. He wed Jane Means Appleton, the daughter of a former president of Bowdoin College, in a house on the town green.

The Nashua and Wilton Railroad passed through Amherst.

Amherst is located in New Hampshire&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, represented by Democrat Ann McLane Kuster (D-Hopkinton). The town is located in New Hampshire&#x27;s 11th State Senate district, represented by Democrat Shannon Chandley (D-Amherst).

In the New Hampshire House of Representatives, Amherst has two districts covering the town. Hillsborough 34 is a district with three seats covering just the town of Amherst; it is currently represented by three Democrats: Dan Leclerc, Jennifer Morton, and Dan Veilleux. Amherst also shares Hillsborough 37, a single-member district, with the neighboring town of Milford, New Hampshire; it is represented by Democrat Megan Murray (D-Amherst).

The Souhegan River, an east-flowing tributary of the Merrimack, passes through the southern part of the town, and the Souhegan&#x27;s tributary Beaver Brook drains the central part of town and passes through the main village. Baboosic Lake is farther north, along the eastern border of the town and is fed by Joe English Brook. The lake drains to the east into Baboosic Brook, a tributary of the Merrimack. Pulpit Brook, which drains the northeastern corner of the town, flows into Baboosic Brook as well. Witches Brook flows through the southernmost part of the town and is a tributary of Pennichuck Brook, yet another tributary of the Merrimack. Amherst&#x27;s highest point is on Chestnut Hill at the town&#x27;s northern border, where the elevation reaches above sea level.

<text>Bedford is a town in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, United States. At the 2020 census, the population was 23,322, reflecting a growth of 10% from 2010. Bedford is a suburb of Manchester, New Hampshire&#x27;s largest city.

==History==
In 1733, the Province of Massachusetts Bay established Bedford as &quot;Narragansett, No. 5&quot; for the benefit of soldiers who fought against the Narragansett people in Rhode Island. The area was also known as &quot;Souhegan East&quot;. The settlement was incorporated as &quot;Bedford&quot; in 1750, and was named for John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford. Lord Russell, a close friend of Governor Benning Wentworth, was the Secretary of State for the Southern Department from 1748 to 1751, and his first wife, Diana Spencer, was cousin of the influential Duke of Marlborough.

The first English settlers in Bedford were Robert and James Walker III. A monument dated 1737 stands on what is now known as Station Road (adjacent to Hawthorne Drive), marking the first settlement. Bedford&#x27;s first moderator was Mayor John Goffe, son of the Colonel John Goffe after whom Goffstown was named.

In 1874, Bedford was served by the Concord Railroad, and service by the Manchester and Ashburnham Railroad was being planned.

Like much of southeastern New Hampshire, Bedford grew rapidly in the second half of the 20th century. The 2000 population of 18,274 was over eight times the population in 1950 of 2,176. Every decade in that period had a substantial rate of growth, ranging from 33 percent between 1980 and 1990 to a 67 percent increase between 1950 and 1960. As of the 2020 census, Bedford was the 11th largest municipality in the state, with a population of 23,322.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 0.85% of the town. The largest body of water other than the Merrimack River is Sebbins Pond, which is connected to smaller, neighboring bodies of water by Sebbins Brook.

A rock formation called Pulpit Rock (originally the Devil&#x27;s Pulpit) is located in the northwestern part of the town on New Boston Road and is the feature of the town-owned Pulpit Rock Conservation Area. The highest point in Bedford is Holbrook Hill, at above sea level, located in the extreme northwestern corner of town. Bedford lies fully within the Merrimack River watershed.

* Manchester (east)
* Merrimack (south)
* Amherst (southwest)

==Transportation==
Two major highways run through Bedford. The Everett Turnpike runs north-south, and Route 101 runs east-west. The segment of the Everett Turnpike north of NH 101 and the segment of NH 101 east of the Everett Turnpike are designated Interstate 293; I-293 turns at this interchange. The portion of Route 101 in eastern Bedford from New Hampshire Route 114 to the Manchester border is a freeway, while the remainder of the route through the town is a surface road. US 3 also runs through Bedford.

Manchester–Boston Regional Airport is one town away, in Manchester.

A proposed extension of the MBTA Commuter Rail&#x27;s Lowell Line would see trains being extended to the neighboring city of Manchester, making stops at Nashua and Bedford along the way. The proposed Bedford/MHT station stop would be located in Bedford underneath the Raymond Wieczorek Drive Bridge, and is intended to serve both the town of Bedford and Manchester-Boston Regional Airport.

==Education==
The school district is the Bedford School District. There are six schools in Bedford: Memorial Elementary School (National Blue Ribbon School awardee in 2012), Peter Woodbury Elementary School, and Riddle Brook Elementary (National Blue Ribbon School awardee in 2017 and 2023) are neighborhood elementary schools that serve grades K through 4. McKelvie Intermediate School accommodates grades 5 and 6. Ross A. Lurgio Middle School and Bedford High School have served grades 7–8 and 9–12, respectively, since their establishment in 2007.

Ross A. Lurgio Middle School and Bedford High School comprise one building. The unified construction aimed to take advantage of economies of scale by allowing the schools to share a kitchen, an auditorium, and security guards, but they operate as separate schools with different entrances, bus schedules, start times and end times. Additionally, key-controlled access is required to move between schools.

A portion of Saint Anselm College is located in Bedford. This includes some athletic fields.

Previously Bedford had an agreement with the Manchester School District so that students were sent to Manchester West High School. In 2005 about 900 high school aged residents of Bedford attended Manchester West. Beginning in fall 2007 Bedford stopped sending new students to Manchester West, so it could instead send them to Bedford High. By fall 2009 Bedford no longer sent any levels to Manchester West.

<text>Brookline is a town in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 5,639 at the 2020 census, up from 4,991 at the 2010 census. Brookline is home to the Talbot-Taylor Wildlife Sanctuary, Potanipo Pond, and the Brookline Covered Bridge.

==History==

First a part of Dunstable, Massachusetts, then settled as West Hollis, New Hampshire, the town was granted in 1769 as &quot;Raby&quot;. Colonial Governor John Wentworth named it after his cousin, the 4th Earl of Strafford and Baron of Raby Castle.

The town was renamed in 1798 at the suggestion of a leading citizen in town originally from Brookline, Massachusetts. By 1859, when the population was 718, there were eight sawmills and one gristmill, as well as a sash and blind shop. In the earlier days of the town, Brookline was known throughout southern New Hampshire for producing lumber, charcoal and casks. The Boston and Maine Railroad eventually branched into Brookline in 1892. The train station that served Brookline during the railroad&#x27;s tenure in the town has since been renovated into a private residential home. A large fraction of the area that was once railroad track is now New Hampshire Route 13.

The town received national attention in 1997, when people participating in the traditional ringing of the Congregational church bell at midnight on the Fourth of July were arrested. Several prominent members of the community were among those arrested, including Road Agent Clarence Farwell and his wife. The incident led to an investigation of the Brookline police department after questions of excessive force were raised following the arrests.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which are land and are water, comprising 1.79% of the town. The town&#x27;s highest point is the western summit of Birch Hill, at above sea level. Potanipo Hill is a summit southwest of the town center that once was the site of a ski area from 1935 to 1984, and now is home to Andres Institute of Art.

Brookline is drained by the Nissitissit River and Spaulding Brook. The Nissitissit is known for its abundance of trout. The Nissitissit begins at the outlet of Potanipo Pond, west of the town center, and flows southeast to join the Nashua River in Pepperell, Massachusetts. Via the Nashua River, Brookline lies fully within the Merrimack River watershed.

The town is crossed by New Hampshire Route 13 and New Hampshire Route 130. It is about west of Nashua and approximately northwest of Boston, Massachusetts.

It was renamed the Brookline Community Church in 2005 and is affiliated with both the UCC and UMC conferences.

<text>Goffstown is a town in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, United States. The population was 18,577 at the 2020 census. The compact center of town, where 3,366 people resided at the 2020 census, is defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as the Goffstown census-designated place and is located at the junctions of New Hampshire routes 114 and 13. Goffstown also includes the villages of Grasmere and Pinardville. The town is home to Saint Anselm College (and its New Hampshire Institute of Politics), the Goffstown Giant Pumpkin Regatta, and was the location of the New Hampshire State Prison for Women, prior to the prison&#x27;s relocation to Concord in 2018.

== History ==
Prior to the arrival of English colonists, the area had seasonally been inhabited for thousands of years by succeeding cultures of Native Americans; its waterways had numerous fish, and the area had game.

The town was first granted as &quot;Narragansett No. 4&quot; in 1734 by New Hampshire and Massachusetts colonial Governor Jonathan Belcher as a Massachusetts township (the area then being disputed between the two provinces). It was one of seven townships intended for soldiers (or their heirs) who had fought in the &quot;Narragansett War&quot; of 1675, also known as King Philip&#x27;s War. In 1735, however, some grantees &quot;found it so poor and barren as to be altogether incapable of making settlements,&quot; and were instead granted a tract in Greenwich, Massachusetts.

The community was called &quot;Piscataquog Village&quot; and &quot;Shovestown&quot; before being regranted by Masonian proprietor Governor Benning Wentworth in 1748 to new settlers. These included Rev. Thomas Parker of Dracut and Colonel John Goffe, for whom the town was named. He was for several years a resident of neighboring Bedford, and he was the first judge of probate in the county of Hillsborough. Goffstown was incorporated June 16, 1761. A large part of the town was originally covered with valuable timber. Lumbering and fishing were the main occupations of the early settlers. The village of Grasmere was named for Grasmere, England, home of the poets William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

A Congregational church was organized about October 30, 1771, and the town made annual small appropriations for preaching. The majority of residents were Congregationalists; residents in the south part were of Scots-Irish descent and were Presbyterian. A meeting-house was erected in 1768; but it was not completed for several years. The first minister was Joseph Currier, appointed in 1771; he was dismissed August 29, 1774, for intemperance, according to the town records. In 1781, the Congregationalists and the Presbyterians organized separately; the former called Rev. Cornelius Waters, who became their pastor, and continued till 1795. The next minister was David L. Morril, who began March 3, 1802. He was supported by both congregations under the name of the Congregational Presbyterian church. Morril was elected as a representative of the town to the state house, as a U.S. senator for the state, and in 1824, as governor of the state, serving until 1827.

The Piscataquog River, which bisects the main village of Goffstown and was spanned by a covered bridge, provided water power for industry. In 1817, Goffstown had 20 sawmills, seven grain mills, two textile mills, two carding machines, and a cotton factory. Its textile industry was an example of the economic ties between New England and the American South, which was dependent on slave labor for production of its lucrative cotton commodity crop.

The town was described in 1859 by the following:

In 1816, the Religious Union society was organized. A new meetinghouse was erected in the west village. Meetings were held two thirds of the time in the new house, and one third in the old house at the center.
In 1818 and 1819 residents were deeply interested in the preaching of Rev. Abel Manning, as part of the Second Great Awakening. 65 persons joined the church that year. Other ministers were Benjamin H. Pitman (1820 to 1825), Henry Wood (1826 to 1831), and Isaac Willey (1837 to 1853). A Baptist church was formed in 1820.

The town annexed islands on the Amoskeag Falls in the Merrimack River in 1825 and part of New Boston in 1836.

In the early part of 1841, a woman, simply remembered as Miss Parker, commenced preaching here, and shortly more than half the voters in town came into her support. She professed no connection with any church. A town historian notes that &quot;Near the close of her labors she advised her converts to form a Methodist Church.&quot;

The Uncanoonuc Mountains in Goffstown once featured the Uncanoonuc Incline Railway, founded in 1903. It first carried tourists in 1907 to the summit of the south peak, on which was built that year the Uncanoonuc Hotel. The -story building provided 37–38 guest rooms, and a dining room that accommodated 120. It also offered outstanding views of the surrounding valley, including Manchester, connected by electric trolley to the railway&#x27;s base station. The hotel burned in 1923, and the train was later used to transport skiers to the top. The railway peaked during the 1930s and 1940s, but was essentially abandoned by the 1950s. The summit of the south peak is now the site of numerous television and radio towers.

Grasmere Village straddles the Piscataquog River in the eastern region of Goffstown. The Hillsborough County Railroad Station was located at Grasmere on the southern side of the river. Rail-borne freight for Grasmere and other surrounding locales was delivered to this station during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Another rail station in Goffstown was located to the west closer to the town center, and a third was Parker&#x27;s Station to the west of the town center.

The railroad line which passed through Goffstown was built by the New Hampshire Central Railroad and was later acquired by the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad in 1895, who operated it as their North Weare Branch. of track between Goffstown and Henniker Junction were abandoned in 1937 due in part to damage from the floods of 1936, declining passenger counts and few freight customers. The remaining from Goffstown to Manchester remained in service for freight as the Goffstown Branch. Notable customers on the branch included Homgas at Grasmere, New Hampshire Doors Co. at Factory Street, and Merrimack Farmers Exchange and Kendall-Hadley Lumber in the village. In 1976 the town&#x27;s landmark railroad covered bridge burned due to arson, ending service to the center of town and forcing the remaining freight trains to stop on the eastern side of the Piscataquog River. The customers marooned by the fire either had their shipments trucked in from Manchester&#x27;s railroad yard, or unloaded at New Hampshire Doors and then trucked the short remaining distance. No replacement structure was ever erected in place of the covered bridge. The last two rail customers in Goffstown were Kendall-Hadley Lumber and New Hampshire Doors Co; the former elected to truck its shipments from Manchester&#x27;s railroad yard, while the latter shut down completely in 1980. The final freight train, led by Boston &amp; Maine EMD GP7 1557, traveled to Goffstown on September 20, 1980, and the line was officially abandoned in February 1981, with the rails being removed in the following years. In the dawning years of the 21st century, town and local organizations cooperated in a rails-to-trails effort, converting the railbeds into bicycling and walking trails.

On a ridge currently overlooking the Piscataquog River from the south above the midpoint between Glen Lake and Namaske Lake, adjacent to New Hampshire Route 114, originally stood the Poor Farm. In 1849 Noyes Poor sold the property to the county and it became the Hillsborough County Farm, a home for the indigent, ill, and infirm. The farm was sold into private hands in 1867 but re-acquired by the county in 1893 and again served as a residence for disadvantaged citizens of the county until 1924. A cemetery with numbered headstones is presently maintained by the county on these grounds but the tables relating the markings to the recorded names of the residents who died at the Farm appear to have been lost.

The County Farm grounds were converted to the New Hampshire State Prison for Women, located until 2018 at 317 Mast Road. The facility&#x27;s most famous resident was the convicted murderer Pamela Smart, who was incarcerated at the Prison for Women from March 22, 1991, to March 11, 1993, when she was transferred to Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in Bedford, New York.

The pumpkins are then hollowed out and sold to local businesses for use in the regatta. On Sunday, the pumpkins are placed in the Piscataquog River under Main Street and raced up and down the river. Local business personnel ride inside the pumpkins, usually in costume and having decorated their pumpkins. The event began in 2000 as a promotional tactic by the New Hampshire Giant Pumpkin Growers Association, and inspired a similar event in Damariscotta, Maine.
