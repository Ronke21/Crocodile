<text>East Hanover Township is a township in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 11,105, a decrease of 52 (−0.5%) from the 2010 census count of 11,157, which in turn reflected a decline of 236 (−2.1%) from the 11,393 counted in the 2000 census.

Located between the Passaic and Whippany rivers, East Hanover shares a border with four Essex County municipalities; but only has roadways that connect the township with neighboring Livingston and Roseland.

East Hanover is notably home to the North American headquarters of Mondelez International (parent company of Nabisco) and the pharmaceutical company Novartis.

==History==
The Township of Hanover was established on December 7, 1720, and named in honor of the British King George I of the German dynastic House of Hanover. The boundaries of East Hanover are defined by the joining of two rivers, the Whippany River to the west and north and the Passaic River to the east and north. This geographic effect led to the early name of East Hanover, &quot;Hanover Neck.&quot; Since the creation of Hanover Township in 1720, its size has been considerably decreased as the population of the area has increased. Originally encompassing large portions of Morris County and parts of both Sussex and Warren County, Hanover Township became too unwieldy for a single local government and municipalities split off from the township over time.

East Hanover was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 12, 1928, from portions of Hanover Township, based on the results of a referendum held on May 9, 1928, that split off both East Hanover Township and Parsippany–Troy Hills from Hanover Township.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 8.10 square miles (20.98 km2), including 7.88 square miles (20.40 km2) of land and 0.23 square miles (0.58 km2) of water (2.79%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Cooks Bridge, Hanover, Hanover Neck and Swinefield Bridge.

<text>Florham Park is a borough in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 12,585, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 889 (+7.6%) from the 11,696 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn reflected an increase of 2,839 (+32.1%) from the 8,857 counted in the 2000 census.

Florham Park was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 9, 1899, from portions of Chatham Township. In 2012, Forbes.com listed Florham Park as 440th in its listing of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Expensive ZIP Codes&quot;, with a median home price of $675,107.

Since 2008, Florham Park has been the main operations headquarters for the National Football League&#x27;s New York Jets.

==History==
First occupied by the Lenape tribe of Native Americans, the area that is now Florham Park was first settled by European settlers of English and Dutch origin sometime between 1680 and 1700, and the community was long recognized as a prime farming area. The area was known for the manufacture of quality brooms, which was the source of one of its town names, Broomtown. At various times during its history, the area was known as Hoppingtown, Broomtown, Columbia, Afton, and finally Florham Park. It was part of Hanover Township, then Chatham Township before being incorporated as Florham Park in 1899.

Florence Adele Vanderbilt Twombly (1854–1952), granddaughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt, renowned as the richest man in America, and her husband, financier, Hamilton McKown Twombly, came to the Morris County countryside in 1887, joining over 100 other millionaires who owned sprawling country retreats. They fancied an English-style country mansion in a stately park setting. &quot;Florham,&quot; built on , one of America&#x27;s finest Gilded Age homes, was the result. The couple named their new estate &quot;Florham,&quot; a combination of their first names, Florence and Hamilton. The second part to the name &quot;Florham Park&quot; received its name from a second mansion in town that was on about of land situated where the current Brooklake Country Club is located. Owned by Leslie Ward—one of the founders of the Prudential Insurance Company and the first vice president of the company—it was named &quot;Brooklake Park&quot;, partially because of the beautiful lake that was on the property.

Both of these families were supporters of many civic projects including the petitioning of the State of New Jersey to create their own municipality. After the legislature voted on March 9, 1899, the governor signed the bill on March 20, making Florham Park a borough. The new town was named after Florence and Hamilton Twombly&#x27;s and Ward&#x27;s estates.

<text>Hanover Township is a township in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 14,677, its highest decennial count ever and an increase of 965 (+7.0%) from the 13,712 recorded at the 2010 census, which in turn reflected an increase of 814 (+6.3%) from the 12,898 counted in the 2000 census. The township comprises the unincorporated communities of Whippany and Cedar Knolls.

Located just north of the historic town of Morristown (separated by a thin strip of Morris Township) and adjacent to the regional Morristown Municipal Airport, Hanover Township offers many public attractions including the Whippany Railway Museum, the Frelinghuysen Arboretum and the Morris County Library. Patriots&#x27; Path, a wilderness walkway and bike trail that stretches for , also passes through the township along the Whippany River.

== History ==
Hanover Township is the site of the first European settlement in northwest New Jersey. New Englanders established a settlement along the Whippany River in 1685 near the current location of the old Whippany Cemetery on Route 10.

Once the Province of West Jersey purchased the land from the local Lenape Native Americans, the original County of Morris was created and comprised all of what is now Morris, Sussex and Warren Counties. The counties were partitioned into townships. Morris&#x27; original township was &#x27;Whippenny&#x27; which itself comprised all of what is now Morris County.

The name &quot;Hanover&quot; was taken from the House of Hanover in Germany. This namesake was given to the Township of Hanover on December 7, 1720, as a sign of respect to George I of Great Britain who was of the House of Hanover and who ruled over the American colonies in the eighteenth century. Its size has been considerably decreased as the population of the area has increased since the creation of Hanover Township in 1720 and its incorporation on March 25, 1740, with the formation of Morris County. Originally encompassing all of Morris County and parts of Sussex and Warren County, Hanover Township became too unwieldy for a single local government to maintain. The Township was subdivided into smaller municipalities that could provide more responsive local control despite placing greater demands on the local tax base to support new facilities for each.

Portions of the township were taken to form Mendham Township on March 29, 1749. Hanover Township was established by the Township Act of 1798 of the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798. Additional portions of the township were taken to form Chatham Township (February 12, 1806), Rockaway Township (April 8, 1844), Boonton Town (March 16, 1866), Mountain Lakes (April 29, 1924), Morris Plains (April 15, 1926), East Hanover Township and Parsippany-Troy Hills Township (which both split off on May 9, 1928).

During the Revolutionary War, George Washington and his troops often camped in, and marched through, Hanover Township.

The name Whippany is adapted from the Native American word &quot;Whippanong&quot; which means “place of the arrow wood&quot;.

The old settlements of Monroe and Malapardis were consumed by development and what remains are two communities—Whippany and Cedar Knolls—which are roughly separated by Interstate 287.

The Malapardis area of Cedar Knolls is primarily located around Malapardis Road. A section of Malapardis, even though it is in Hanover Township&#x27;s borders, has a Morris Plains mailing zip code. Another section of Cedar Knolls is called Trailwood which has a section of its land in a Morris Plains ZIP code, the area closest to American Way.

The Monroe area of Whippany is located around Whippany Road and Cedar Knolls Road, marked by a building in the intersection named Monroe Hall.

Until the post-World War II suburbanization of New Jersey, Hanover Township was a sparsely populated industrial town known for its iron works and paper mills. This industry was driven by the ever-present power of the Whippany River. Over the second half of the twentieth century, the Township became thoroughly suburban.

Lucent Technologies had a large facility in Whippany. The first demonstration of long distance television transmission in the United States took place in 1927, with a transmission that went via wire from Washington, D.C., to New York, and from Whippany to New York using radio.

The Seeing Eye, the first guide dog school for the blind in the United States, was located in Whippany between 1931 and 1966, before moving to its current campus in nearby Morris Township.

==Name confusion==
There is some confusion over the place names in Hanover Township which results from the sometimes arcane usage of place names in New Jersey.

Whippany and Cedar Knolls are place names for unincorporated communities. They each have their own ZIP Code and fire department but are otherwise simply neighborhood names. The two each had their own post office until 2011, when flooding from Hurricane Irene destroyed the Whippany post office.

Next to Hanover Township is East Hanover Township which has a neighborhood called &#x27;Hanover&#x27;. Also, there is a New Hanover Township and a North Hanover Township in Burlington County, and several other Hanover Townships in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Furthermore, street signs and maps often do not identify Hanover Township but instead indicate one of the place names.

Residents of Whippany and Cedar Knolls have become accustomed to indicating that they live in either Whippany or Cedar Knolls and not in Hanover Township. Some confusion comes from the difference between neighborhood boundaries, and the arbitrary ZIP Code boundaries that do not necessarily coincide with municipal boundaries resulting in township mailing addresses which use place names outside of the township. Whippany&#x27;s ZIP code is 07981 and Cedar Knolls&#x27; is 07927.

==Notable events==
On January 5, 2009, five unidentified red lights were spotted in the night sky over Hanover Township and Morris County. The event became nationally known as the Morristown UFO hoax after two residents disclosed how they had used road flares attached to balloons to create the objects seen across the area.

<text>Harding Township is a township in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is located in the Passaic Valley region within the New York Metropolitan area. The township was formed as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on September 1, 1922, from portions of Passaic Township (since renamed as Long Hill Township), based on the results of a referendum passed on May 9, 1922. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 3,871, an increase of 33 (+0.9%) from the 2010 census count of 3,838, which in turn reflected an increase of 658 (+20.7%) from the 3,180 counted in the 2000 census.

The long-established hamlets of New Vernon and Green Village (also within Chatham Township) are both located in Harding Township. The township is home to the private club community Mount Kemble Lake, a former summer colony developed in the 1920s.

Described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;one of the most restrictive and elegant of New Jersey&#x27;s residential suburban areas&quot; and as an &quot;affluent Morris County township&quot;, the community has been one of the state&#x27;s highest-income municipalities. Harding Township had a per capita income of $109,472 and was ranked first in New Jersey based on data from the 2006–2010 American Community Survey from the United States Census Bureau, more than triple the statewide average of $34,858. Based on data from the ACS for 2014–2018, Harding Township ranked sixth in the state with a median household income of $183,587 and had almost half of households earning more than $200 thousand annually.

The 07976 ZIP Code for New Vernon was named one of the &quot;25 Richest ZIP Codes&quot; in the United States by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine in 2006.

== History ==
After the retreat of the Wisconsin Glacier, a mighty glacial lake called Glacial Lake Passaic formed in this area that, about 15,000 to 11,000 years ago, extended for in length and was wide. The lake finally drained when a blockage of the Passaic River reopened. The Great Swamp is the remnant of the lake bottom and portions of the swamp lay in what now is the township. Once the lake drained, higher areas became a wooded area that was used for hunting, fishing, and farming by Native Americans. At the time of colonization by the Dutch it belonged to the Lenape tribes, but British colonists did their best to displace them westward.

Much of what now is known as Harding was an agricultural community with roots stretching as far back as the early 18th century. Bypassed by colonial turnpikes, revolution era canals, and railroads laid in the Victorian era, the area remained a rural backwater. For almost two centuries of European occupation, its open and rolling landscapes reflected its agricultural use, as land had been cleared for cattle pastures, orchards, and fields of grain. The Great Swamp, the wooded slopes of the Watchung Mountains, and those near Jockey Hollow also were used by local farmers for wood supply. The communities of Green Village, Logansville, New Vernon, and Pleasantville were the village centers in this agricultural community.

Wealthy urban residents from Manhattan and Newark bought farmland, enlarged old farmhouses, and landscaped the grounds. The movement to establish Harding Township was driven by local property owners who wanted to maintain a bucolic community without suburban development.

The township was created in 1922 from the northern half of what was then Passaic Township (present day Long Hill Township) and it was named after the incumbent President of the United States, Warren G. Harding.

The &quot;New Vernon Neighborhood Restrictive Agreement&quot; was established in 1928 by estate owners under which they agreed to voluntarily place restrictive covenants on their land that would require future owners of the properties to maintain the rural nature of the area. This voluntary effort to limit development and save the pastoral qualities of over across Harding Township influenced subsequent zoning codes, which emerged several decades later, and helped preserve the landscape to the present day.

<doc id="125549" wikidata="Q1084058" url="?curid=125549" title="Kinnelon, New Jersey">
<text>Kinnelon () is a borough in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, located approximately west of New York City. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 9,966, a decrease of 282 (−2.8%) from the 2010 census count of 10,248, which in turn reflected an increase of 883 (+9.4%) from the 9,365 counted in the 2000 census. It is a low-density, suburban community, with many parks and trails.

Once known as Charlotteburg, Kinnelon was formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on February 20, 1922, from portions of Pequannock Township, based on the results of a referendum passed on March 21, 1922. The borough&#x27;s name comes from Francis S. Kinney, who purchased of land in the 1880s for an estate that included Lake Kinnelon, and built St. Hubert&#x27;s Chapel in 1886 on an island in the lake.

Kinnelon is home to Smoke Rise, a private gated community that describes itself as one of the oldest gated communities in the United States. It includes more than 900 unique homes located on in addition to Lake Kinnelon and Kitty Ann Mountain.

In 2012, Forbes.com listed Kinnelon as 462nd in its listing of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Expensive ZIP Codes&quot;, with a median home price of $630,414.

The borough is one of the state&#x27;s highest-income communities. Based on data from the American Community Survey (ACS) for 2014–2018, Kinnelon residents had a median household income of $156,048, almost double the statewide median of $79,363.

==History==
Then still part of Pequannock Township and known as Charlotteburg (named after Charlotte, wife of King George III of Great Britain), early settlements in the Kinnelon area date back to the late 17th century when iron forges and furnaces were first established. Mining and forest cropping were major occupations of the earliest settlers. The construction of the Morris Canal in the early 1820s led to a significant decline in the mining industry, after which the land was sold over time.

During the early part of the 20th century, like much of Morris County at the time, the area became a haven for the wealthy who were attracted by the isolation and natural beauty. The most notable example of this was Francis S. Kinney, a 19th-century industrialist who founded Kinney Brothers Tobacco Company and built an estate that dates back to 1883.

One of the largest private holdings in Morris County at any time, Kinney purchased upwards of of land and built a large &quot;summer cottage&quot; known as Smoke Rise, which is a translation of the Pequannock Native American name for the mountainous area, where a heavy mist often rises at sunset. His son, Morris Kinney, for whom the borough of Kinnelon was named 41 years later, lived most of his life on the estate.

On February 20, 1922, with only 400 full-time residents, Kinnelon was formed as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature from portions of Pequannock Township, based on the results of a referendum passed on March 21, 1922.

After the First World War, some residential development occurred in the borough. In 1925, Frank Fay Jr., a real estate developer, along with his son Frank Fay III, purchased 240 acres of farmland that boasted a small pond, later known as West Lake, to create a summer lake community called Fayson Lakes. The Fays advertised Fayson Lakes widely with ads being placed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and New Jersey newspapers; heavily promoting its accessibility and proximity to New York City.

In 1931, an adjoining property featuring a small lake, later known as East Lake, was incorporated into the community. By 1938, an additional parcel of land was purchased and eventually dammed to create a third lake, known as South Lake, in the 1950s. Most homes in the community remained summer residences until the Second World War. Fayson Lakes remains Kinnelon&#x27;s highest density area.

Upon Morris Kinney&#x27;s death in 1945, he left the estate to longtime friend John Talbot Sr., former mayor of the borough, and a founder of the Chilton Memorial Hospital, Pompton Plains (John Talbot Sr. was a real estate developer in New York City and a patron of the arts and was credited with the revival of ballet as a major art form in the United States in the 1930s), as a tribute to their lifetime friendship and mutually shared love of Smoke Rise.

Following the Second World War, the need for suburban housing became evident, John Talbot Sr. went on to create The Smoke Rise Club, one of the earliest community club plans in the United States. Unlike many developers, he insisted that the land be kept in its natural state as far as possible. When friends asked to purchase land on the estate to build homes, Talbot decided to develop a planned community designed primarily to serve New York corporation executives. The Smoke Rise Club was the result in November 1946.

Talbot&#x27;s intention was to develop the property as a residential club community akin to Tuxedo Park in nearby Orange County, New York; envisioning a community of architect-designed houses suitable for ideal country living. By October 1951, more than 100 families were living in Smoke Rise and community services at St. Hubert’s Chapel were revived for the first time since 1923, when it was used as a private chapel. The development of Smoke Rise largely spurred much of the borough&#x27;s growth and rising home values in the 1950s; enhancing Kinnelon&#x27;s standing as a residential suburb.

Since the inception of Smoke Rise, there has been nearly double-digit growth in the borough which today consists of three primary sections, Kinnelon proper, Fayson Lakes, and Smoke Rise. In 2005, it was estimated that Fayson Lakes and Smoke Rise accounted for about 42% of all borough households.

In 2000, Kinnelon had the highest home ownership rate in the state.

In 2012, Forbes.com listed Kinnelon as 462nd in its listing of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Expensive ZIP Codes&quot;, with a median home price of $630,414.

Kinnelon is governed under the borough form of New Jersey municipal government, which is used in 218 municipalities (of the 564) statewide, making it the most common form of government in New Jersey. The governing body is comprised of a mayor and a borough council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The borough council includes six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle. The borough form of government used by Kinnelon is a &quot;weak mayor / strong council&quot; government in which council members act as the legislative body with the mayor presiding at meetings and voting only in the event of a tie. The mayor can veto ordinances subject to an override by a two-thirds majority vote of the council. The mayor makes committee and liaison assignments for council members, and most appointments are made by the mayor with the advice and consent of the council.

, the mayor of Kinnelon is Republican James J. Freda, whose term of office ends December 31, 2026. Members of the Borough Council are Council President Sean Mabey (R, 2023), Robert Lewis (R, 2028), Anthony Chirdo (R, 2025), Eric Harriz (R, 2025), Cyndi Frank (R, 2027) and Ronald Reckler (R, 2028).
In January 2017, Glenn Sisco was selected from three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee and appointed to fill the council seat expiring in December 2017 that had been held by Adam N. Barish; Sisco, served on an interim basis until the November 2017 general election. Sisco served as the mayor of Kinnelon for 42 years, making him one of the longest-serving mayors in the state of New Jersey.

In March 2016, the Borough Council unanimously selected William Neely from three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2016 that had been held by Stephen Cobell until his resignation the previous month after nearly 12 years in office; Neely will serve on an interim basis until the November 2016 general election, when voters will choose a candidate to serve the balance of the term of office.

Selected by a 3–2 majority of the borough council from among three potential candidates, Clifford Giantonio was sworn into office in April 2014 to fill the vacant seat of Ronald Mondello, who had resigned in the previous month citing personal and work conflicts.

<text>Long Hill Township is a township in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 8,629, a decrease of 73 (−0.8%) from the 2010 census count of 8,702, which in turn reflected a decline of 75 (−0.9%) from the 8,777 counted in the 2000 census.

The township is situated in the southernmost part of Morris County bordering both Somerset and Union counties. It is bounded by the Passaic River to the south and west and to the north by the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge which covers of land overseen by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Refuge lands also lie within neighboring Chatham and Harding townships.

Originally incorporated as &quot;Passaic Township&quot; in the 1860s, residents voted to change the town&#x27;s name to Long Hill Township in 1992. It includes the communities of Gillette, Stirling, Millington, Meyersville and Homestead Park. NJ Transit rail service is available at the Gillette, Millington and Stirling stations.

==History==

Long Hill Township was incorporated as &quot;Passaic Township&quot; on March 23, 1866. On September 1, 1922, part of what was then Passaic Township was taken to form Harding Township. On November 3, 1992, by a 1,901 to 1,821 margin, the voters elected to change the name of the municipality to &quot;Long Hill Township&quot;, a change largely driven by the desire to avoid confusion with the City of Passaic, some away.

Garden State Fireworks, a firm based in Millington that dates back to 1890, has produced the annual July 4 fireworks show in Washington, D.C., on the National Mall. The Raptor Trust is a wild bird rehabilitation center located in Millington.

==Library==
The Long Hill Township Library began about 1880 in what was then known as Passaic Township. At the time a group of women in Millington formed a reading club purchasing a small number of books to trade amongst themselves. A similar group was established in Meyersville. In 1920, when the Morris County Library was built, the groups joined the county system and books on loan from the county were housed in the homes of the associations&#x27; members.

By the 1950s, the Millington Association&#x27;s Library had relocated to the Town Hall and the Meyersville group occupied one room in the town&#x27;s Central School. In 1956, however, the Township asked the Millington Association to find other quarters, and the Central School location had steadily become less than satisfactory due to increasing enrollment. A referendum in the amount of $25,000 for the construction of a new building was submitted to the community. The measure passed by two votes. The new library opened in 1958 on Central Avenue in Stirling as the Passaic Township Free Public Library with a paid director and several volunteers.

By 1968, the library&#x27;s collection had grown substantially and plans were made for a new addition to the building. Another $25,000 was raised and the addition was completed in 1972. A later addition followed in the 1980s. The library remained on Central Avenue until 2005 when an entirely new building was dedicated in April of that year. After the township formally changed its name to Long Hill Township in 1992, the Passaic Township Free Public Library was renamed as the Long Hill Township Free Public Library.

The Long Hill Township Library now occupies a site in Gillette, adjacent to Township Hall. The library contains of space and has a capacity for 72,000 books.

<text>Madison is a borough in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 16,937, an increase of 1,092 (+6.9%) from the 2010 census count of 15,845, which in turn reflected a drop in population of 685 (−4.1%) from the 16,530 counted in the 2000 census.

Madison is noted for its historic railroad station. The station is located on the Morris &amp; Essex Lines, which was one of the nation&#x27;s first commuter railroads. Many wealthy residents of Manhattan relocated to Madison and its surrounding communities since the rail line offered direct transport to New York City. Madison is known as &quot;The Rose City&quot; and was named in honor of President James Madison.

Madison was ranked 33rd in &quot;Money&quot; magazine&#x27;s ranking of the &quot;Best Places to Live&quot; in 2011, the third-highest ranked location in New Jersey and second-highest in Morris County behind Montville. &quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; ranked Madison first in its 2019 rankings of the &quot;Best Places to Live&quot; in New Jersey.

Madison is a college town that is the home of both Drew University and Fairleigh Dickinson University; Saint Elizabeth University is located in neighboring Convent Station, New Jersey. Madison is also home to the Shakespeare Theatre of New Jersey, one of the largest professional Shakespeare companies in North America.

==History==
===Pre-settlement===
Native Americans occupied present-day Madison and most of New Jersey for several thousand years, following the retreat of the Wisconsin Glacier. Lenape settlements in present-day Madison were agriculturally-based following matrilineal lines. The protected lands nearby, Jockey Hollow, are what is remaining of the settlement. Occupation changed with the seasons, the variable nature of the climate, and to preserve the fertility of the rich soil. Their fishing and hunting territories were wide-ranging and similarly divided among the three clans of the matrilineal culture in this Eastern Woodland environment. Trade with these native peoples for food and furs was conducted by the Dutch during the period of colonization of New Netherland. Although the European principle of land ownership was not recognized by the Lenape, Dutch West India Company policy required their colonists to purchase land that they settled, but typically, trading relationships were established in this area, rather than Dutch settlements.

===18th century===
During the British colonial period of the 17th and 18th centuries, the earliest settlers arriving in Madison were of European descent in what was then the colonial-era Province of New Jersey. Traditional native trails and pathways were followed as settlement began. Pressures upon the Lenape constantly drove them westward.

In or around 1715, Bottle Hill, a village, was established at the crossing of Ridgedale Avenue and Kings Road. Village governance principles followed the British model. The Luke Miller house at 105 Ridgedale Avenue is thought to be the oldest remaining home, having been built around 1730. During British colonial rule, Kings Road was a toll road that assessed fees levied by the government appointed by the English king. Farther south was the &quot;Shunpike&quot;, a road with a parallel path that was used by colonists to avoid the fees.

In 1739, Morris County, New Jersey was founded and was divided into three townships. The portion of the village north of Kings Road was put under the governance of Hanover Township and the portion to the south, under the governance of Morris Township. A meeting house for the Presbyterian Church of South Hanover, as Madison was then called, was started in 1747 where the Presbyterian Cemetery still exists between Kings Road and Madison Avenue. With the Treaty of Easton in 1758, the Lenape were required to vacate their lands in colonial New Jersey and to move westward. Their leaders allied with the colonists during the American Revolutionary War in hopes of regaining former lands, but those hopes were never realized.

Following the American Revolution, changes to governing the former colonies occurred gradually as the new nation organized. The state of New Jersey formed its government and debated best policies.

===19th century===
 
During a reorganization of Morris County in 1806, Chatham Township was established and included all of present-day Chatham Township and the three pre-Revolutionary War villages of Chatham, Florham Park, and Madison, which were still governed by Chatham Township, and ended the governmental division of Bottle Hill.

In 1834, the name of the settlement was changed to Madison. As a tribute to the name every year there is a fair that is called Bottle Hill Day.

In 1838, the Morris and Essex Railroad was founded, connecting Newark and Hoboken and providing transportation for farm produce grown in Madison. The railroad made possible the establishment of a flourishing rose growing industry, still commemorated in Madison&#x27;s nickname, &quot;The Rose City&quot;. The rail service connected the commerce to the markets of Manhattan. Madison&#x27;s growth accelerated after the Civil War and the Morris and Essex Lines became one of America&#x27;s first commuter railroads, attracting well-to-do families from Manhattan (many of whom already owned large parcels land in the area for farming, hunting, and recreation) and contributing to the development of &quot;Millionaire&#x27;s Row&quot;, which stretched from downtown Madison to downtown Morristown. Greenhouses dotted the countryside. Talented horticulturalists were attracted to the area for employment at the many wealthy estates in the immediate area and to establish related businesses. One of the first grand houses to be built on &quot;Millionaire&#x27;s Row&quot; was the Ross Estate. In 1893, Florence Adele Vanderbilt and her husband Hamilton McKown Twombly began to build the impressive Florham estate. The estate name is a portmanteau of their first names, Florence and Hamilton. Home to Fairleigh Dickinson University, Florham is a Gilded Age mansion and the 9th largest house in the United States.

On December 27, 1889, based on the results of a referendum passed on December 24, 1889, the village seceded from Chatham Township and adopted the newly created, borough government (when it first became available), to develop a local water supply system for its population of 3,250. Madison annexed additional portions of Chatham Township in 1891, and again each year from 1894 to 1898, which was followed by an exchange of certain lands in 1899 with Chatham Township.

Madison&#x27;s historic railroad station was funded by the community, which passed an ordinance authorizing $159,000 for railroad improvement bonds. The result, with the cooperation of the D.L. &amp; W.R.R. in the planning, was completed in 1916. The tracks were elevated through the downtown so that no established roadways were hindered by crossing delays. Mrs. D. Willis James financed much of the road grading caused by the elevation of the tracks. The station included baggage and cargo facilities readily accessible by wagon, as well as the stationmaster offices, a newsstand, and waiting facilities featuring extensive banks of high-backed wooden seating. Weeping mulberry trees were planted among the landscaping and in natural areas in the parking area.

The rose industry and the large estates in the area attracted working-class people of all kinds. As a result, Madison developed a diverse population very early, both in terms of socioeconomic status and ethnic background. The original settlers were of British stock; French settlers came after the American Revolution; African Americans have been members of the community from early in the nineteenth century; Irish came in the mid-nineteenth century; and then Germans and Italians arrived around the turn of the twentieth century. To this day there is a substantial population of Italian descent in Madison. Madison remains a diverse community, with recent newcomers arriving from Central America, South America, and Asia. Madison is a railroad suburb of New York City.

===20th century===
The Evergreen Cemetery was mentioned in &quot;Weird NJ&quot; for an incident in 1902, when after a downpour, bodies were found on the streets.

<text>Mendham Borough is a borough in southwestern Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 4,981, unchanged from the 2010 census, which in turn reflected a decline of 116 (−2.3%) from the 5,097 counted in the 2000 census. Located in the Raritan Valley region within the New York metropolitan area, the North Branch of the Raritan River begins in Mendham Borough and flows in a southwest direction towards neighboring Somerset County.

Located on the northern end of the Somerset Hills region, the borough is known for its country homes and historic downtown.

The Mendham Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the state register in 1985. Notable landmarks in the district include the Phoenix House, which serves as the borough&#x27;s municipal building, along with the Black Horse Inn Tavern &amp; Pub; New Jersey’s oldest continually operating restaurant, dating back to 1742.

&quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine ranked Mendham Borough as the number one place to live in the state in its 2013 rankings of the &quot;Best Places to Live&quot; in New Jersey.

In the &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2006 (209th; median sale price of $835,000) and 2012 (356th; $800,672) rankings of the &quot;Most Expensive ZIP Codes in the United States&quot;, Mendham was listed among the top 500 nationwide. In 2018, &quot;New Jersey Business Magazine&quot; listed Mendham at 41st in its listing of &quot;The Most Expensive ZIP Codes in New Jersey&quot;, with a median sale price 2017 of $650,000.

Along with Mendham Township, the Mendhams have been described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;both affluent&quot;. The borough is one of the state&#x27;s highest-income communities. Based on data from the American Community Survey (ACS) for 2014–2018, Mendham Borough residents had a median household income of $158,542, almost double the statewide median of $79,363.

==History==
Mendham Borough was incorporated by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on May 15, 1906, from portions of Mendham Township, because residents of what became the borough wanted sidewalks and street lights constructed while those that lived in what remained the township (including the communities of Brookside and Ralston) felt it was cost prohibitive in their more rural areas.

The formation of Mendham Borough from Mendham Township in 1906 began a series of new municipalities that were created in the Somerset Hills region.

Located on the borough&#x27;s southern slope of Bernardsville Mountain in the Somerset Hills lies Wendover, the former estate of investment banker Walter Phelps Bliss (1870-1924). One of the largest mansions in the Mendhams, Wendover is now home to the Roxiticus Golf Club.

Phoenix House was purchased by Arthur Whitney of Mendham Township in 1919 and deeded to the borough in 1938 for use as its municipal building.

===Name===
The Mendhams may be named for Mendham, Suffolk, England, or the name may derive from the Native American word &quot;mendom&quot; (meaning &quot;raspberry&quot;) or for an Earl of Mendham.

===Historic district===

The Mendham Historic District is a historic district located along stretches of Route 24, known in Mendham as Main Street. This east-west roadway is well over 200 years old, and has been called the Washington Turnpike, the Mendham-Morristown Road, and the William Penn Highway at various times in its history. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 18, 1985, for its significance in agriculture, commerce, architecture, settlement, and religion from 1750 to 1924. The district includes 140 contributing buildings. Since 1999, Mendham Borough has had a Historic Preservation Ordinance designed and intended to enhance and preserve the district&#x27;s historic character.

According to the National Park Service:
The Mendham Historic District consists of 140 properties, generally well preserved, that illustrate the history of the village from its eighteenth century founding through its 1906 incorporation as a borough, and into the first third of this century when infill building completed development within the historic bounds of the village. The District covers the central crossroads of the village, and extends as far as the area nineteenth century maps illustrate as &quot;Mendham, P.O.&quot;, the village core containing the post office. The conjunction of religious, residential, and commercial buildings that have established Mendham&#x27;s village character are well preserved today.

<text>Mendham Township is a township in southwestern Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, located more than due west of New York City. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 6,016, an increase of 147 (+2.5%) from the 2010 census count of 5,869, which in turn reflected an increase of 469 (+8.7%) from the 5,400 counted in the 2000 census.

Located on the northern end of the Somerset Hills, Mendham Township is situated in the Raritan Valley region within the New York Metropolitan area. The township may be named for Mendham, Suffolk, England, or it may derive from the Native American word &quot;mendom&quot; (meaning &quot;raspberry&quot;) or for an Earl of Mendham.

The long-established hamlets of Brookside and Ralston are located within Mendham, and both are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Along with Mendham Borough, the Mendhams have been described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;both affluent&quot;.

==History==
The township was formed on March 29, 1749, from portions of Hanover Township, Morris Township and Roxbury Township. After the Revolutionary War, on February 21, 1798, the township was incorporated by the Township Act of 1798 of the New Jersey Legislature as one of the state&#x27;s initial group of 104 townships. Portions of the township were taken to create Randolph Township on January 1, 1806. Mendham Borough became an independent municipality when it was formed on May 15, 1906.

Natural resources of water, forests and minerals drew settlers to the area. The area of Ralston had iron forges, sawmills, and a gristmill by 1748, located in an area along the North Branch of the Raritan River. Northeast of Ralston is India Brook. On the eastern side of Mendham Township, brooks that formed the upper reaches of the Whippany River attracted settlers to the valley called Water Street or Waterville, later known as Brookside.

Following the Civil War, wealthy industrialists and financiers established country homes in the Morristown area and Bernardsville&#x27;s &quot;Mountain Colony&quot;, including in the Mendhams. Historic homes, structures, and local settlements are relics of the township&#x27;s history as a community where people lived and worked in a rural community far from the city&#x27;s &quot;dark satanic mills&quot;.

<text>Montville is a township in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 22,450, an increase of 922 (+4.3%) from the 2010 census count of 21,528, which in turn reflected an increase of 689 (+3.3%) from the 20,839 counted in the 2000 census.

Montville was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 11, 1867, from portions of Pequannock Township. It includes the sections of Montville, Pine Brook and Towaco. NJ Transit rail service is available at the Towaco station along the Montclair-Boonton Line.

In &quot;Money&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2013 Best Places to Live rankings, Montville was ranked 13th in the nation, the second-highest among the three places in New Jersey included in the top 50 list. The township was ranked 17th in the magazine&#x27;s 2011 ranking of the &quot;Best Places to Live&quot;, the highest-ranked place in New Jersey, after having been ranked 13th in 2007. In 2009, &quot;Money&quot; magazine named Montville the 21st best place to live in the United States; the 2nd highest ranked community in New Jersey.

==History==
=== Native settlement ===

Over 10,000 years ago, the area was part of the Lenapehoking. It was originally settled by the Lenape tribes of the Munsee dialect. The Lenape tribes maintained peace and no significant battles were recorded in the area.

On October 12, the Morris County Parks Commission holds Lenape Day at the Great Swamp to celebrate the culture and history of Ramapough Lenape people.

=== Dutch settlement ===
Dutch farmers from New Amsterdam (now part of New York City) entered the area in 1710. As part of New Netherland, the town was originally called &quot;Uyle-Kill&quot; (the Dutch spelling of &quot;Owl-Kill&quot;), a name given to the creek and valley, which ran through the area.

By the 1740s, the settlement had grown in size and construction of the first road was begun. The early road, now known as U.S. Route 202, connected various farms with Montville&#x27;s first gristmill, sawmill and tanneries.

In 1756, the Dutch Reformed Church was founded in Old Boonton and moved to Montville in the early 1800s after land was purchased in Montville for a parsonage.

=== English settlement ===
In 1712, William Penn bought a tract of land that included parts of modern-day Pequannock and Montville that included Pine Brook.

In 1760, the first schoolhouse in the Montville township was built out of logs in Pine Brook. It was located on &quot;the road leading to Boonton,&quot; which could refer to multiple northwest-facing roads including Changebridge Road. Additional schools were constructed in 1785, 1816, and 1852.

During the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), Montville was on a major military route from Morristown to the Hudson River. General George Washington&#x27;s troops often took this route and Washington stayed in the Towaco section of what is now Montville Township in June 1780. The French troops under the leadership of General Rochambeau spent four days passing through Montville Township on their way to the War&#x27;s final victory at Yorktown, Virginia, as part of a group of 5,000 soldiers, 2,000 horses, 500 oxen, possibly 900 cattle, artillery, boats and followers.

The Mandeville Inn was established around 1770 and was pronounced &quot;Mondeveil&quot; by the Dutch, which in turn was corrupted to Montville. The Montville Inn was, up until July 2006, located at the site of the pre-Revolutionary War Mandeville Inn, which burned down in the early 20th century. Other sources attribute the township&#x27;s name to its location in the mountains of Northern New Jersey.

In 1809, the first store in Montville was opened by Conrad Esler. In 1820, Montville contained 16 houses, 2 bark mills, a grist mill, a cider mill and distillery, a blacksmith shop, a carpenter shop, a wheelwright shop, and a small store; at the time, Montville was considered a business center compared to nearby towns. By 1880, it contained 40 houses, a bark mill, two grist mills, a tannery, a saw mill, a rubber factory, two blacksmith shops, two taverns, and 2 stores.

The construction of the Morris Canal in this area was completed in 1828, bringing commercial navigation to the Montville/Towaco area. The mid-19th century saw the development of two smaller village centers set apart from Montville: Pine Brook, a fertile agricultural area in the Township&#x27;s southern end, and Towaco, situated on the Morris Canal.

In 1867, Montville and Boonton split off from Pequannock township.

=== 20th century ===
By 1910, the population of Montville was 690.

The Pine Brook Speedway, which operated from July 1962 until October 1989, was designed for midget car racing and became one of the earliest sites for microstock racing. Mario Andretti raced at the track and had some of his earliest success as a race car driver at the Speedway.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 19.12 square miles (49.51 km2), including 18.63 square miles (48.24 km2) of land and 0.49 square miles (1.27 km2) of water (2.57%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Horse Neck Bridge, Lake Valhalla, Lower Montville, Pine Brook, Taylortown, Towaco and White Hall.

The township borders the municipalities of Boonton, Boonton Township, East Hanover Township, Kinnelon, Lincoln Park and Parsippany-Troy Hills in Morris County; and Fairfield Township in Essex County.

Camp Dawson is a small camp area in Towaco that is home to a variety of recreational events such as hiking, sledding, soccer, lacrosse, rugby and football. In 2007, Camp Dawson was described by &quot;Money&quot; magazine as one of reasons for ranking Montville as the 13th best smaller population place to live in the United States. Many Montville sports teams use the fields at Camp Dawson, which include two turf fields mainly used for football, soccer and lacrosse. These fields have lighting available for these teams to play at night. There was a flurry of concern in 2008, when testing of Dawson&#x27;s new artificial turf playing fields showed what turned out to be false positive finding of dangerously high levels of toxic lead.

===Climate===
The lowest recorded temperature in Montville is −25 °F (−32 °C), set in February 1943, and the highest recorded temperature is 105 °F (41 °C), set in July 1936 and 2011.

<text>Morris Township is a township in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 22,974, an increase of 668 (+3.0%) from the 2010 census count of 22,306, which in turn reflected an increase of 510 (+2.3%) from the 21,796 counted in the 2000 census. The township was named for Lewis Morris, colonial governor of New Jersey.

Located along the Morris and Essex Lines, the township is a wealthy bedroom community, with many residents traveling to work in nearby New York City on NJ Transit which provides commuters with direct access to New York Penn Station and to Hoboken Terminal.

The township is the &quot;doughnut&quot; around Morristown and completely surrounds it, with at least five times the area, though near Morris Plains the width of Morris Township is less than a mile. For 115 years, Morristown was part of Morris Township. The initial separation of Morristown from Morris Township occurred on April 6, 1865. A confusing state of affairs followed for nearly thirty years. On February 18, 1895, the separation was officiated.

Morris Township is home to the Morris County Golf Club and the Morris Museum, which is the second largest museum in New Jersey and has been in operation since 1913. The township is also home to the Morristown National Historical Park which in 1933 became the country&#x27;s first National Historical Park.

Morris Township was incorporated as a township by the Township Act of 1798 by the New Jersey Legislature on February 21, 1798, as part of the state&#x27;s initial group of 104 townships.

Portions of the township were later taken to create Chatham Township (February 12, 1806), Morristown (April 6, 1865, fully independent in 1895) and Passaic Township (on March 23, 1866, now Long Hill Township).

<doc id="125561" wikidata="Q1343509" url="?curid=125561" title="Heartbreak Hotel">
<text>&quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; is a song recorded by American singer Elvis Presley. It was released as a single on January 27, 1956, Presley&#x27;s first on his new record label RCA Victor. It was written by Mae Boren Axton and Tommy Durden, with credit being given also to Presley. A newspaper article about the suicide of a lonely man who jumped from a hotel window inspired the song. Axton presented the song to Presley in November 1955 at a country music convention in Nashville. Presley recorded it on January 10, 1956, in a session with his band, the Blue Moon Boys, the guitarist Chet Atkins and the pianist Floyd Cramer. &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; comprises an eight-bar blues progression, with heavy reverberation throughout the track, to imitate the character of Presley&#x27;s Sun recordings.

The single topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 100 for seven weeks, &quot;Cashbox&quot;″s Pop singles chart for six weeks, and the Country and Western chart for seventeen weeks as well as reaching No. 3 on the R&amp;B chart, becoming Presley&#x27;s first million-seller, and one of the best-selling singles of 1956. &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; achieved unheard of feats as it reached the top 5 of Country and Western, Pop, and Rhythm &#x27;n&#x27; Blues charts simultaneously. It was eventually certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Presley had first performed &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; during a live show in December 1955 during a tour of the &quot;Louisiana Hayride&quot;; it gained popularity after his appearance on &quot;Stage Show&quot; in March 1956. It became a staple of Presley&#x27;s repertoire in live appearances, last performed by him on May 29, 1977, at the Civic Center in Baltimore.

In 1995, &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and in 2004 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine named it one of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. That year it was also included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s &quot;500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll&quot;. A rock and roll standard, &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; has been covered by several rock and pop acts, including Willie Nelson and Leon Russell, who recorded a duet version that topped the Country charts in 1979.
RCA reissued &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; on CD in 2006 on its 50th anniversary featuring the 1956 black and white EP cover.

==Background and writing==

The song was written in 1955, by Mae Boren Axton, a high school teacher with a background in musical promotion, and Jacksonville, Florida-based singer–songwriter Tommy Durden. The lyrics were based on a report supposedly in &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; about a man who had destroyed all his identity papers and jumped to his death from a hotel window, leaving a suicide note with the single line, &quot;I walk a lonely street&quot;. Songfacts.com says they were unable to locate the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; story. They labeled it an urban legend. In 2016, an article in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine suggested that the story in reality originated from a report about a painter and criminal, Alvin Krolik, whose marriage had failed and who wrote a unpublished autobiography including the line &quot;This is the story of a person who walked a lonely street.&quot; Krolik&#x27;s story was published in news media, and received further publicity after he was shot and killed in an attempted robbery in El Paso, Texas. On August 25, 1955, the &quot;El Paso Times&quot; reported Krolik&#x27;s death under the headline &quot;Story of Person Who Walked Lonely Street&quot;. Krolik&#x27;s death was not a suicide, so it could not have inspired the song to Tommy Durden. 

Axton and Durden give different accounts of how the song was written. Durden&#x27;s account is that he had already written the song and performed it with his band the Swing Billys before he presented it to Axton. Axton&#x27;s account is that Durden had written only a few lines of the song and asked her to help him finish it. She says that the report of the suicide &quot;stunned&quot; her, and she told Durden, &quot;Everybody in the world has someone who cares. Let&#x27;s put a Heartbreak Hotel at the end of this lonely street&quot;. They were interrupted by the arrival of Glenn Reeves, a local performer who had previously worked with Axton. The duo asked Reeves to help with the song, but after hearing the title he remarked that it was &quot;the silliest thing I&#x27;ve ever heard&quot;, and left them to finish it themselves. The song was written within an hour, and Durden recorded it onto Axton&#x27;s tape recorder. Reeves returned, and after hearing the song he was asked to provide a voice demo for Axton in the style of Elvis Presley. Reeves obliged, but once again turned down the offer of a writing credit for his input.

Axton approached the popular singing duo the Wilburn Brothers, and offered them the chance to record &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;. However, Doyle and Teddy Wilburn declined, describing the song as &quot;strange and almost morbid&quot;. Axton, however, agreed to a publishing deal with Buddy Killen, a young Nashville bass player working as a song plugger for a new publishing company called Tree Publishing. With a publishing deal in place, Axton arranged through Presley&#x27;s manager Colonel Tom Parker to present the song to Presley at the annual Country Music Disc Jockey Convention in Nashville, Tennessee, where he was to be named the most promising male country star of 1955. Axton had been hired earlier in the year to publicise the Hank Snow Jamboree concerts at the Gator Bowl Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida, which included Presley in the line up. During one concert Axton observed the reaction of the audience to Presley&#x27;s performance, in which a crowd of screaming fans chased him back to his dressing room and ripped his clothes off to take as souvenirs. Axton followed Presley&#x27;s career closely after this incident, and met him at a July 28 concert in Jacksonville, this time interviewing him for the local media. According to author Albert Goldman, Axton made writing Presley&#x27;s first big hit one of her ambitions.

Rumors had been circulating in the press for several weeks that Presley, who had begun his career at Sun Records, was ready to move to RCA Victor to help launch him nationally. Axton played the demo to him in his room at the Andrew Jackson Hotel on November 10, 1955. Upon hearing the demo, Presley exclaimed &quot;Hot dog, Mae, play that again!&quot;, and listened to it ten times, memorizing the song. After signing with RCA on November 21, 1955, Presley accepted Axton&#x27;s offer of a third of the royalties if he made the song his first single on his new label. Presley performed the song for the first time in Swifton, Arkansas, on December 9, 1955, and declared to the audience that it would be his first hit.

==Recording==
&quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; was the second song Presley recorded at RCA Victor, following &quot;I Got a Woman&quot;, during his debut session at 1525 McGavock Street in Nashville on January 10, 1956. Presley arrived at the studio with the song ready to record without seeking RCA&#x27;s approval, and although producer Steve Sholes was not sure that it would be a success, he recorded &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; believing that Presley knew what he was doing. Recording at RCA Victor was a different experience for Presley and his band, who were used to a more relaxed atmosphere at Sun Studio. Guitar player Scotty Moore later commented, &quot;It was a larger studio than Sun&#x27;s and more regimented - they called everything by a tape number. We would sit around at Sun, eat hamburgers and then somebody would say, &#x27;Let&#x27;s try something.&#x27;&quot;

Almost immediately Sholes discovered a problem while recording Presley. RCA Victor had always insisted their performers stay still as they sang so the microphone would pick up the vocals; even the slightest tilt of the head would result in missing sound. Sholes had told Presley to stand on a painted X on the floor, telling him &quot;Whatever you do, don&#x27;t move&quot;. During the recording of &quot;I Got a Woman&quot;, Sholes noticed that Presley&#x27;s voice and guitar were not always being picked up by the microphone. Presley explained to Sholes that he had to &quot;jump around to sing it right. It&#x27;s something that just happens—just a part of the way I sing&quot;. Sholes arranged for the whole studio to be re-miked so that Presley&#x27;s voice and guitar could be picked up from anywhere in the studio, and recording continued.

As well as the Blue Moon Boys, his regular backing band of Moore, the bassist Bill Black and the drummer D.J. Fontana, Presley was joined by two established RCA Victor musicians: Chet Atkins (who also helped Sholes produce the session) on guitar and Floyd Cramer on piano. Following a suggestion from Presley, Sholes used a hallway at the studio to get an unusual echo for the single. Sholes was attempting to recapture the Sun Records sound, but he was unaware that Sun founder Sam Phillips had used two tape recorders and a slight time delay to create it on previous Presley recordings. When Phillips first heard &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, he remarked that it was a &quot;morbid mess&quot;. Most others at RCA agreed, declaring &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; a terrible choice of song, especially after hearing that the finished recording sounded nothing like Presley&#x27;s Sun recordings. Internal memos from the time show that every one of RCA&#x27;s executive corps disliked it so much that one of them insisted &quot;We certainly can&#x27;t release that one&quot;.

In an interview, Durden conceded that he did not recognize his song after Presley had made the changes to it in the studio, including the tempo, phrasing, lyrics, and overall sound. In subsequent recordings, these major modifications to the existing material became a normal procedure for Presley who took over the role of producer, although Sholes was still credited. Phillips said Sholes &quot;was not a producer. Steve was just at every session.&quot;

==Release and reception==

&quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; was released as a single on January 27, 1956, with B-side &quot;I Was the One&quot;, a song that was also recorded during Presley&#x27;s RCA Victor debut sessions. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine praised it as &quot;a strong blues item wrapped up in his usual powerful style and a great beat&quot;. However, &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; was less-than-warmly received by the British music press. The &quot;New Musical Express&quot; wrote that, &quot;If you appreciate good singing, I don&#x27;t suppose you&#x27;ll manage to hear this disc all through.&quot; BBC, which held a monopoly on broadcasting in Britain at the time, didn&#x27;t consider it fit for general entertainment and placed it on its &quot;restricted play&quot; list.

Presley made his national television debut on January 28, appearing on CBS&#x27; &quot;Stage Show&quot;, starring Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey. As &quot;Stage Show&quot;″s ratings had been slipping, producer Jack Philbin agreed to have Presley on because he was relatively cheap at $1,250 (about $14,116 in 2023); after looking at a photograph of the singer, Philbin exclaimed, &quot;He&#x27;s a guitar-playing Marlon Brando!&quot; Despite the single having been released only a day before to coincide with Presley&#x27;s national television debut, the Dorsey brothers did not allow Presley to perform it on their show because it didn&#x27;t work well in rehearsals. For his second appearance, on February 4, Presley was again aware that he could not perform &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;. However, at his third appearance on &quot;Stage Show&quot; a week later, Sholes pressured CBS to give consent. Subsequently, Presley and his band performed &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; with borrowed instruments (their own were being driven to Florida in preparation for a tour) with the backing of the Dorsey Brothers&#x27; orchestra.

On February 22, the song entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart at number 68, and the Country and Western chart at number nine. Within two months, &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; reached number one on both charts. It also made top five on the R&amp;B chart, the first Presley single to chart there. This resulted in &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; becoming only the second single in history to reach all three &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, after Carl Perkins&#x27; &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot;. The song spent a total of twenty-seven weeks in the top 100. By April, &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; became a million-seller, earning Presley his first RIAA-certified gold record, and going on to be the biggest-selling single of 1956. &quot;Heartbreak Hotel/I Was the One&quot; was certified Platinum on March 27, 1992, and 2× Platinum on July 15, 1999, by the RIAA.

The song also became Presley&#x27;s first charting single in the United Kingdom. It made its debut on the UK Singles Chart in May 1956; it peaked at number two the next month and stayed on the charts for 22 weeks. In November 2022, it was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for sales and streams exceeding 200,000 units.

==Legacy==
Presley performed the song during most of his live shows between 1956 and 1977, and for the last time on May 29, 1977, at the Civic Center in Baltimore, Maryland. The song has been released on almost every Presley compilation album since 1956, and alternative takes have surfaced on several compilation albums. &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; was awarded by the Broadcast Music Incorporated in its Country Music Awards. It was re-released in 1971 for the UK market, where it charted at number 10. In 1979, following Presley&#x27;s death, author Robert Matthew-Walker wrote: &quot;&#x27;Heartbreak Hotel&#x27; became one of the legendary rock performances. For many people it &quot;is&quot; Elvis Presley, and it continues to excite and fascinate listeners. &#x27;Heartbreak Hotel&#x27; is a classic performance, yet when it is analyzed it appears so simple that one cannot recall a time when one did not know it.&quot; In 1995, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and was re-released in 1996 to coincide with the 40th anniversary of its recording.

In a 1975 interview, John Lennon recalled his friend Don Beatty&#x27;s introducing him to Presley&#x27;s music. Lennon said that his family rarely had the radio on, unlike other members of the Beatles who grew up under its influence. Beatty showed Lennon a picture of Presley that appeared along with the charts on the &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, and Lennon later heard &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; on Radio Luxembourg. Lennon has said:

George Harrison described &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; as a &quot;rock n roll epiphany&quot; when in 1956, at age 13, he overheard it while riding his bike at a neighbor&#x27;s house. Some have said that &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; turned that well-mannered schoolboy into a guitar-crazed truant who would audition for John Lennon&#x27;s Quarrymen the following year.

The Rolling Stones&#x27; guitarist Keith Richards wrote in his 2010 autobiography &quot;Life&quot; that &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; had a huge effect on him. Beyond Presley&#x27;s singing itself, it was the total effect of his sound and his silence that so totally affected Richards:

Led Zeppelin&#x27;s lead singer Robert Plant stated that the song &quot;changed his life.&quot; He recalled hearing it for the first time when he was 8 years old:

Critic Robert Cantwell wrote in his unpublished memoir &quot;Twigs of Folly&quot;:

The song was mentioned in the chorus of Patty Loveless&#x27;s 1988 single &quot;Blue Side of Town&quot; from her album &quot;Honky Tonk Angel&quot;.

President Bill Clinton performed the song on tenor saxophone during his appearance on &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot; on June 3, 1992. In 2004, it was ranked number 45 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame included it in its unranked list 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll and in 2005, &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine ranked the first performance of &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; in 1956 by Presley as the second greatest and most important cultural event of the rock and roll era. Paul McCartney, who participated in &quot;Uncut&quot;″s poll stated, &quot;It&#x27;s the way [Presley] sings it as if he is singing from the depths of hell. His phrasing, use of echo, it&#x27;s all so beautiful. Musically, it&#x27;s perfect.&quot;

&quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, a film based on a mythical incident involving the kidnapping of Presley, was released theatrically in 1988. It starred David Keith as Elvis Presley and was directed by Chris Columbus. In 1999, Elvis Presley Enterprises purchased a Wilson World Hotel branch and after several renovations, opened it and named the hotel after the song, located across the street from Presley&#x27;s home, Graceland, in Memphis, Tennessee.

In the CBS miniseries &quot;Elvis&quot;, a two-part, four hour television movie that explores Elvis Presley&#x27;s life, a scene depicts Presley (played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers) wanting to record &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; when he first arrives at RCA. The song is later used when he is performing at the Dorsey Brothers Stage Show, with Meyers lip-synching.

In 2015, &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; was named as the #2 song of the rock era in the book &quot;The Top 500 Songs of the Rock Era: 1955–2015&quot;.

In his solo song &quot;Piledriver Waltz&quot;, written for the EP &quot;Submarine&quot;, Alex Turner of the Arctic Monkeys, references going for breakfast at &quot;The Heartbreak Hotel.&quot;

==Early cover types==
Radio humorist Stan Freberg parodied &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; immediately after its release, because the vocals on the original record featured a heavy use of reverb. In the cover, the lead singer repeatedly asks for &quot;more echo on [his] voice.&quot; When Presley recorded &quot;Hound Dog&quot; a few months later, he had taken over the role of producer, using what he learned at Sun Records (although Sholes was still credited) and decided not to use echo.

Connie Francis recorded the song for her 1959 album &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Million Sellers&quot;; this album also features &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;. Country singer Johnny Cash parodied the song in 1959 on the television show &quot;Town Hall Party&quot;, imitating Presley&#x27;s characteristic crib and hip movements. Before the performance Cash explained that it was &quot;an impersonation of a rock and roll singer impersonating Elvis, is what this really is&quot;.

Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn noted that, at first as the Quarrymen then later as the Beatles, the group performed &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; live from 1957 until 1961 (in Liverpool then later in Hamburg and elsewhere). It is unclear whether the lead vocal was by John Lennon or Paul McCartney or both. A recorded version has not been forthcoming. However, McCartney (using Bill Black&#x27;s upright bass) did a version for a documentary &quot;Elvis – Viva Las Vegas&quot;, which also appears on DVD.

==Later renditions==
Part of the original personnel of the 1956 recording released their own versions, Chet Atkins recorded it for the 1963 album &quot;The Guitar Genius&quot;, and also, Presley&#x27;s lead guitarist Scotty Moore recorded the song for his 1964 album &quot;The Guitar that Changed the World&quot;. Willie Nelson and Leon Russell had a number one cover version in 1979 on the country charts, it was Russell&#x27;s only number one hit on the charts.

Paul McCartney later also made another cover of the song in &quot;Chaos and Creation at Abbey Road&quot;, performing it with Bill Black&#x27;s bass.
Others who have covered the song include Ann-Margret, who would later co-star with Presley in the 1964 motion picture &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;, The Cadets, Delaney Bramlett, Justin Timberlake, Cher, Roger Miller, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, John Cale, Merle Haggard, Tom Jones, Dax Riggs, Roger McGuinn, Suzi Quatro, Van Halen, Jimi Hendrix, Neil Diamond, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Tones on Tail, and Queen + Adam Lambert. In Canada, a version by The Scoundrelz reached #60 in 1966, and another by Frijid Pink reached #38 in 1971.

In the 1992 film &quot;Honeymoon in Vegas&quot;, Billy Joel made a version of &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; and &quot;All Shook Up&quot;, while the same year in &quot;True Romance&quot;, actor Val Kilmer performed an a cappella version. Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman covered the song in a medley with Prince&#x27;s &quot;Kiss&quot;, for the 2006 Warner Bros. film &quot;Happy Feet&quot;. The song was also featured in Alvin and the Chipmunks&#x27; 1990 television special &quot;Rockin&#x27; Through the Decades&quot;, as part of the fifties medley and its soundtrack and again for the 2007 video game &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks&quot;.

<text>Jailhouse Rock is a 1957 American musical drama film directed by Richard Thorpe and starring Elvis Presley. Adapted by Guy Trosper from a story written by Nedrick Young, the film tells the story of Vince Everett (Presley), a convict who learns the guitar while in prison and becomes a star following his release. Four of the film&#x27;s songs were written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller including the title track, which became a highly-praised production number in the film as well as one of Presley&#x27;s biggest hit singles, spending seven weeks at number one on the U.S. charts. 

&quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; premiered in Memphis, Tennessee on October 17, 1957, and was released nationwide on November 8. It peaked at #3 on the &quot;Variety&quot; box-office chart and finished #14 for the year, grossing $4 million. The film initially earned mixed reviews, with much of the negative targeted at the unpleasant personality of the character played by Presley. The release was also somewhat overshadowed by the tragic highway death of leading lady Judy Tyler shortly after the film&#x27;s completion. Presley reportedly was so devastated by Tyler&#x27;s death that he never watched the film or discussed it.

In 2004, &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, who deemed it &quot;culturally, aesthetically or historically significant.&quot;

== Plot ==
Construction worker Vince Everett accidentally kills a drunken man in a brawl and is sentenced to between a minimum of one to a maximum of ten years in the state penitentiary. His cellmate, washed-up country singer Hunk Houghton, incarcerated for bank robbery, teaches Vince some guitar chords. Hunk then convinces Vince to participate in an inmate show that is broadcast on nationwide television. After his appearance, Vince receives fan letters, but the warden prevents their delivery.

Hunk convinces Vince to sign a pact to become equal partners in his act when they are both free. Later, during an inmate riot in the mess hall, a guard shoves Vince, who retaliates by striking him. As punishment, the warden orders Vince to be lashed with a whip. Vince later learns that Hunk attempted to bribe the guards to forego the punishment but did not have enough money.

Upon Vince&#x27;s release 14 months later, the warden gives him his withheld fan mail. Hunk promises Vince a singing job at a nightclub owned by a friend. There, Vince meets Peggy Van Alden, a promoter for pop singer Mickey Alba. Vince is surprised when the club owner denies him a job as a singer but offers him a job as a bar boy. To prove himself to the owner, Vince takes the stage to sing when the house band takes a break. However, a customer laughs throughout the performance. Enraged, Vince smashes his guitar and leaves the club. Peggy then persuades him to record a demo so that he can listen to himself sing. The recording helps Vince improve his style, and he records a song. Peggy takes the tape to Geneva Records, where the manager seems unimpressed, but reluctantly agrees to play the tape for his boss in New York. The next day, Peggy informs Vince that the song has been sold. She then takes him to a party at her parents&#x27; home, but Vince leaves after offending a guest whom he mistakenly believes is belittling him. Angry, Peggy confronts Vince, who kisses her. Later, the two discover that Geneva Records gave the song to Mickey Alba. Alba recorded and released the song, thereby stealing it. Infuriated, Vince storms into the label&#x27;s office and attacks the manager.

To avoid a similar misfortune, Vince convinces Peggy to form their own label, which they name Laurel Records, and hire attorney Mr. Shores to oversee the business. Vince then records another song and begins pitching it. The song is universally rejected until Peggy convinces a friend, disc jockey Teddy Talbot, to air it. Then, it becomes a hit. Vince asks Peggy out to celebrate but is disappointed to learn that she had already accepted a dinner date with Teddy.

Later, Vince makes arrangements for another television show. At a party, Hunk, who has been granted parole, persuades Vince to give him a part in the show in an effort to revive his own music career. However, Hunk&#x27;s number ends up being cut because of his outdated music style. Vince later informs Hunk that the pact that they signed in prison is worthless. However, indebted to Hunk for having tried to bribe the guards, Vince offers him a job with his entourage.

Vince soon becomes a star. However, Peggy no longer speaks with Vince, as his success has made him arrogant. Vince signs a movie deal, and the studio head asks him to spend the day with his conceited costar Sherry Wilson for publicity purposes. Sherry then falls in love with Vince after shooting a kissing scene.

Mr. Shores later approaches Vince with an offer from Geneva Records to purchase Laurel Records and sign him to a rich contract. Peggy refuses to sell and is devastated when Vince wants to close the deal anyway. Enraged by Vince&#x27;s egotism and treatment of Peggy, Hunk starts a fight and strikes Vince in the throat, endangering the latter&#x27;s voice and singing ability. At the hospital, Vince forgives Hunk and realizes that he loves Peggy and that she loves him. Vince&#x27;s doctor later informs him that his vocal cords are fully recovered, and in the living room, Vince tests his voice by singing to Peggy. Realizing that Vince&#x27;s singing voice is intact and his worries are unfounded, the two put their arms around each other.

== Cast ==
* Elvis Presley as Vince Everett, an ex-con who becomes a singing star. Producer Pandro S. Berman&#x27;s wife convinced him to make a film with Presley in the leading role. Presley&#x27;s manager, Colonel Tom Parker, was only interested in the film&#x27;s score and the rights to record sales and publishing royalties, and Presley was paid $250,000 and 50% of the film&#x27;s royalties.
* Judy Tyler as Peggy Van Alden, a music promoter who helps Vince build his career and becomes his lover. Tyler was previously known for her part as Princess Summerfall Winterspring on the television show &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; and as Suzy in the Broadway musical &quot;Pipe Dream&quot; (1955). Tyler took a three-month leave of absence from &quot;Howdy Doody&quot; to shoot the film. Tyler and her husband were killed in a car crash on July 3, just days after production was completed and before its premiere. Presley was so devastated that he refused to watch the film.
* Mickey Shaughnessy as Hunk Houghton, Vince&#x27;s cellmate and a former country singer. He teaches Vince the guitar and later becomes Vince&#x27;s assistant. Shaughnessy was known as Leva in &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1953). He was also a comedian, and &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Shaughnessy had performed a 45-minute routine deriding Presley sometime before the film was made. Elaine Dundy, author of the book &quot;Elvis and Gladys&quot; (1985), considered his selection an &quot;odd choice&quot; and the result of Berman&#x27;s lack of involvement with casting.
* Vaughn Taylor as Mr. Shores, an attorney whom Vince and Peggy hire to manage Vince&#x27;s financial affairs.
* William Forrest as the studio head (uncredited)
* Jennifer Holden as starlet Sherry Wilson. The film was Holden&#x27;s debut; after auditioning for the role at MGM in May 1956, she was selected immediately. She studied drama with Lillian Roth and had previously appeared on stage.
* Dean Jones as disc jockey Teddy Talbot. Jones was formerly a blues singer, and he was coached for the role by disc jockeys Ira Cooke and Dewey Phillips. Jones went on to star in a string of Walt Disney films.
* Anne Neyland as Laury Jackson
* &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; cowriter Mike Stoller (of the Leiber and Stoller songwriting partnership) and Presley&#x27;s regular band during that period—Scotty Moore, Bill Black and D. J. Fontana—appear as Vince&#x27;s band throughout the film, though uncredited.

==Production==

&quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; was Presley&#x27;s third film and his first for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios, filmed in Culver City, California. The film was originally titled &quot;The Hard Way&quot; and was changed to &quot;Jailhouse Kid&quot; before MGM finally settled on &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;. The film was not listed with the studio&#x27;s planned releases for the year because it was based on a story by Nedrick Young, a blacklisted writer. During production, producer Pandro Berman was more focused on another of his productions, the 1958 film &quot;The Brothers Karamazov.&quot; He allowed studio head Benny Thau and William Morris Agency president Abe Lastfogel to select the cast. Richard Thorpe, who had a reputation for quickly finishing projects, was chosen to direct the film.

The first scene filmed was the title dance sequence to the song &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;. Presley was not initially pleased with the direction of choreographer Alex Romero, so Romero asked Presley to try his own moves to for the final sequence. The scene has often been cited as Presley&#x27;s greatest musical moment on screen. Filming began on May 13, 1957, with the newly created choreography.

Presley&#x27;s characteristic hairstyle and sideburns were covered with a wig and makeup for the musical and jail scenes. During the performance, one of Presley&#x27;s dental caps detached and became lodged in his lung, and he spent a night in the hospital before filming resumed the next day.

Thorpe, who usually filmed scenes in a single take, finished the film by June 17, 1957.

===Soundtrack===

Before production began, rock-and-roll songwriting partners Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller were commissioned to create the film&#x27;s soundtrack, but they did not send any material to MGM for months. In April 1957, the studio summoned the writers to New York and Jean Aberbach, director of the Hill &amp; Range music publishing company, confronted them demanding to see the songs. When told that there was no material, Aberbach locked the songwriters in their hotel room and would not allow them to leave until they had written songs. Four hours later, Leiber and Stoller had written &quot;I Want to Be Free&quot;, &quot;Treat Me Nice&quot;, &quot;(You&#x27;re So Square) Baby I Don&#x27;t Care&quot;, and &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;.

Presley recorded the finished songs at Radio Recorders in Hollywood on April 30 and May 3, 1957, with an additional session at the MGM soundstage in Hollywood on May 9 for &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me Now&quot;. Leiber and Stoller were invited to the recording session of April 30, where they met Presley, who convinced MGM to cast Stoller as the band&#x27;s pianist in the film. During filming, Presley mimed the words for film&#x27;s musical numbers, and the music was later added to the finished scenes. 
The following songs in the film were performed by Presley unless otherwise noted:

* &quot;One More Day&quot; – performed by Mickey Shaughnessy
* &quot;Young and Beautiful&quot; 
* &quot;I Want to Be Free&quot; 
*&quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me Now&quot; 
* &quot;Treat Me Nice&quot; 
* &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; – dance routine choreographed by Elvis Presley
* &quot;(You&#x27;re So Square) Baby I Don&#x27;t Care&quot; - Presley also played electric bass

==Release==

&quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; premiered on October 17, 1957, at Loews State Theater in Memphis. Female lead Judy Tyler had been killed in an automobile accident soon before the film&#x27;s release, and a devastated Presley did not attend the premiere. The film opened nationally on November 8.

===Box office===
The film peaked at #3 on the &quot;Variety&quot; box-office chart and reached #14 for the year.

According to MGM records, the film earned $3.2 million in the U.S. and Canada and $1,075,000 elsewhere during its initial theatrical run, resulting in a profit of $1,051,000.

In 1957, Presley was ranked the fourth-leading box-office commodity in the film industry. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, by 1969, &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;″s gross income in the U.S. and Canada was comparable to that of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939).

===Critical reception===

&quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; earned mixed, largely negative, reviews upon release, although critical opinion has tended to be more favorable over time. Some contemporary critics found it scandalous because it portrayed Vince Everett as an antiheroic character, presented a convict as a hero, used the word &quot;hell&quot; as a profanity and included a scene with Presley in bed with Tyler. The Parent-Teacher Association described the film as &quot;a hackneyed, blown-up tale with cheap human values.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; criticized Guy Trosper for writing a screenplay in which the secondary characters were &quot;forced to hang on to the hero&#x27;s flying mane and ego for the entire picture.&quot; &quot;Cue&quot; magazine called the film &quot;[an] unpleasant, mediocre and tasteless drama.&quot;

Some publications criticized Presley. &quot;Time&quot; panned his onstage personality, while &quot;The Miami News&quot; compared the film with horror pictures and wrote, &quot;Only Elvis Presley and his &#x27;Jailhouse Rock&#x27; can keep pace with the movie debut of this &#x27;personality,&#x27; the records show. In estimating the lasting appeal of their grotesque performer.&quot; Jazz magazine &quot;Down Beat&quot; wrote that Presley&#x27;s acting was &quot;amateurish and bland.&quot; British magazine &quot;The Spectator&quot; described Presley&#x27;s evolution from his &quot;silly&quot; performance in &quot;Loving You&quot; to &quot;dangerously near being repulsive.&quot;

Other reviewers responded more positively to the film. Louise Boyca of &quot;The Schenectady Gazette&quot; wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s dear Elvis that gets the soft focus camera and the arty photography.&quot; Boyca remarked upon the low production costs of the film, and said that Presley was &quot;in top singing and personality form.&quot; &quot;The Gadsden Times&quot; said, &quot;Elvis Presley not only proves himself as a dramatic actor ...  but also reveals his versatility by dancing on the screen for the first time. The movie ... also contains Elvis&#x27; unique style of singing.&quot;
&quot;Look&quot; favored the film, describing how one audience &quot;registered, loud and often, its approval of what may accurately be described as the star&#x27;s first big dramatic singing role.&quot;

More recent critics have tended to praise the film for its vivid portrayal of an iconic moment in music history, and as a welcome contrast to Presley&#x27;s later films, most of them fluffy musical comedies. Leonard Maltin wrote that &quot;Presley&#x27;s best film captures the legend in all his nostril-flaring pre-Army glory.&quot; Author Thomas Doherty wrote in his 2002 book &quot;Teenagers and Teenpics: The Juvenalization of American Movies in the 1950s:&quot; &quot;In &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;, the treatment of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll music, both as narrative content and as cinematic performance is knowing and respectful ... The elaborate choreography for the title tune, the long takes and uninterrupted screen time given to the other numbers, and the musical pacing—the rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll builds in quality and intensity—all show an indigenous appreciation of Presley&#x27;s rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll.&quot; Critic Hal Erickson of &quot;AllRovi&quot; wrote that the film &quot;is a perfect balance of song and story from beginning to end.&quot; Mark Deming, also of &quot;AllRovi&quot;, wrote that &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; was &quot;one of [Presley&#x27;s] few vehicles which really caught his raw, sexy energy and sneering charisma on film.&quot;

The review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes lists the film with an overall 67% &quot;Fresh&quot; approval rating based on 42 reviews. It currently has a Metacritic score of 68 out of 100, based on reviews from 12 critics.

===Accolades===
In 1991, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller were awarded with an ASCAP Award for Most-Performed Feature Film Standards for the song &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot;. In 2004, &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, as it was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; The film is famous for the dance sequence (also choreographed by Presley) in which Presley sings the title track while on stage, cavorting with other inmates through a set resembling a block of jail cells. The sequence is widely acknowledged as the most memorable musical scene in Presley&#x27;s 30 narrative films, and is credited by some music historians as the prototype for the modern music video. &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; ranked 495th on &quot;Empire&quot;″s 2008 list of the 500 greatest films of all time.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2004: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:
** &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; – #21
* 2006: AFI&#x27;s Greatest Movie Musicals – Nominated

<doc id="125565" wikidata="Q831041" url="?curid=125565" title="Dokken">
<text>Dokken is an American heavy metal band formed in Los Angeles in 1978. It split up in 1989 and reformed four years later. The band has had several hit singles which charted on the Billboard Hot 100, such as &quot;Alone Again&quot;, &quot;In My Dreams&quot;, and &quot;Burning Like a Flame&quot;, and has sold more than 10 million albums worldwide. The live album &quot;Beast from the East&quot; was nominated for the inaugural Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1989.

The classic Dokken line-up consisted of founder Don Dokken on vocals, George Lynch on lead guitar, Mick Brown on drums and Jeff Pilson, who replaced the Ratt-bound Juan Croucier in 1983, on bass; this line-up remained stable from 1983 to 1989, and again from 1993 to 1998, and briefly reunited in 2016. After several personnel changes on guitar, Dokken&#x27;s attorney Jon Levin stepped in to fill the role in 2004. In 2001, Barry Sparks replaced Pilson on bass. In 2009, Sean McNabb (formerly with Great White and Quiet Riot) replaced him, and was then replaced by Chris McCarvill in 2015. As of Mick Brown&#x27;s retirement from the band in July 2019, Don Dokken is the only remaining original band member. Brown&#x27;s vacancy was filled by BJ Zampa of House of Lords fame.

==Band history==
===Early years (1976–1983)===
Don Dokken&#x27;s first band formed in 1976, named Airborn. He played shows at clubs in the Los Angeles area, including the Starwood on Sunset Strip. Airborn included Bobby Blotzer on drums and Juan Croucier on bass, but Blotzer and Croucier left the band in 1978 to form FireFoxx. Don Dokken was unable to keep the Airborn name because another band named Airborne had already acquired a record deal. Bringing in Greg Pecka on drums and Steven R. Barry on bass, Dokken recorded a 7&quot; single, &quot;Hard Rock Woman&quot; b/w &quot;Broken Heart&quot;, released in 1979 under the band name Dokken, produced by Drake Levin, best known as the guitarist for Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders.

A Dokken line-up consisting of Don, guitarist Greg Leon, drummer Gary Holland (both from the band Suite 19 which also once featured Mötley Crüe&#x27;s Tommy Lee), and bassist Gary Link toured Germany in 1979 where the band met an up-and-coming producer by the name of Michael Wagener, also the live sound engineer for Accept, who would follow Don back to Los Angeles for a short vacation, a move that became permanent shortly thereafter. The &#x27;79 touring line-up quickly fell apart with Leon taking over Randy Rhoads&#x27; spot in Quiet Riot and Holland joining Dante Fox, later known as Great White. A Michael Wagener-produced Hamburg recording of the &#x27;79 line-up surfaced in 1989 under the title &quot;Back in the Streets&quot;, released by the German label Repertoire Records without the band&#x27;s consent. Dokken toured Germany again in 1980, this time with Croucier back on bass.

In early 1981, Don Dokken returned to Germany trying to get a record deal with a new band in tow, guitarist George Lynch and drummer Mick Brown, who had been playing in a band called Xciter at the time, with Croucier remaining on bass. After recording demos with Wagener and with the help of Accept&#x27;s manager, Gaby Hauke, a deal was secured with Carrere Records. Recorded between July and September 1981 at Studio Stommeln with Wagener and Dieter Dierks, &quot;Breaking the Chains&quot; was initially released under the name &quot;Don Dokken&quot; before it was changed to simply Dokken on subsequent pressings. While in Germany, Don would also demo songs with the Scorpions for their &quot;Blackout&quot; album as the band&#x27;s vocalist Klaus Meine was forced to undergo surgery on his vocal cords and his return was uncertain for a time. Dokken did eventually perform backing vocals on the album. Meanwhile, Lynch, Brown and Croucier ended up working as studio musicians for German singer Udo Lindenberg on his 1982 album &quot;Keule&quot;, playing on four songs: &quot;Urmensch (Prehistoric man)&quot;, &quot;Ratten (Rats)&quot; (both co-written by Lynch, Brown and Lindenberg), &quot;Zwischen Rhein Und Aufruhr (Between the Rhine and the uproar)&quot;, and &quot;Gesetz (Law)&quot;. Promotional activities for the European release of &quot;Breaking the Chains&quot; included a German TV appearance as Dokken performed a 40-minute live set on the Beat-Club as part of a Musikladen Extra which aired on January 4, 1982.

Back in the United States, Dokken were now managed by Cliff Bernstein who got the band signed to Elektra Records for a stateside release of &quot;Breaking The Chains&quot;, remixed for the American market. Dokken played a couple of shows with Warren DeMartini on guitar when George Lynch briefly left to rehearse with Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s band while on tour. The band did an arena tour in the U.S. with Lynch back on guitar supporting Blue Öyster Cult in 1983, but when the tour was over the band was left with little money and was nearly dropped from the label due to the album&#x27;s lack of success.

While the band was very popular in Europe during this time they had not yet made commercial progress in the United States. Magazines such as &quot;Kerrang!&quot; publicized Dokken in the UK.

===Commercial success (1983–1988)===
Juan Croucier left Dokken in 1983 just prior to the release of the &quot;Breaking the Chains&quot; video to join Ratt alongside DeMartini. He was replaced by Jeff Pilson, who joined in time to film the video (without having played the song). The album &quot;Tooth and Nail&quot; was released on September 13, 1984. The album contained several hit songs including &quot;Just Got Lucky&quot;, &quot;Alone Again&quot;, and &quot;Into the Fire&quot;, and sold over one million copies in the US alone, peaking at No. 49, while selling another estimated one million copies worldwide. On November 9, 1985, the band&#x27;s third album &quot;Under Lock and Key&quot; was released. It also sold over one million copies with the singles &quot;In My Dreams&quot; (#24), &quot;The Hunter&quot; (#25) and &quot;It&#x27;s Not Love&quot;. During this time in the 1980s, Dokken opened for such bands as Judas Priest, AC/DC, Aerosmith, Dio and Kiss, among others. The 1986 documentary short &quot;Heavy Metal Parking Lot&quot; features fans of Dokken and Judas Priest tailgating before a concert in Maryland.

Following a successful tour with Scorpions, Dokken returned to the studio in December 1986 to record &quot;Dream Warriors&quot;, a song for the movie soundtrack &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors&quot;. The track brought the band to the attention of many UK hard rock fans. The song was released as a single (&quot;Dream Warriors&quot; / &quot;Back for the Attack&quot;) on February 10, 1987. After this release, the band took nearly 6 months off before recording &quot;Back for the Attack&quot;. The album was released on November 27, 1987, with the singles &quot;Burning Like a Flame&quot; (#20), &quot;Heaven Sent&quot; and &quot;Prisoner&quot; (#37) making the album the band&#x27;s most successful release, reaching No. 13 on U.S. charts. It also included a remixed version of the single &quot;Dream Warriors&quot; (#22), and the accompanying music video featured band members interacting with the film&#x27;s characters. &quot;Back for the Attack&quot; became Dokken&#x27;s third record to reach platinum status.

After releasing &quot;Back for the Attack&quot;, the band toured as part of the Monsters of Rock Tour 1988 festival in the summer of 1988 along with Van Halen, Scorpions, Metallica, and Kingdom Come. Recordings from their April 1988 tour in Japan led to the release of live album &quot;Beast from the East&quot; on November 16, 1988, which went Gold in the United States and charted at No. 33. The album scored one studio single, titled &quot;Walk Away&quot; and a music video was made for it.

===Split (1989–1993)===
Dokken broke up in March 1989, due to creative and personal differences between Don Dokken and George Lynch as well as Don&#x27;s desire to fire the rest of the band and hire new members before they signed their next record deal. Lynch and Brown then formed the band Lynch Mob and recorded two albums: &quot;Wicked Sensation&quot; in 1990 and &quot;Lynch Mob&quot; in 1992.

Don Dokken also recorded what has been regarded as a strong album, titled &quot;Up from the Ashes&quot; in 1990 which spawned two singles, very much in the vein of previous Dokken efforts.

Bassist Jeff Pilson, switching to lead vocals and guitar, formed Flesh &amp; Blood in 1989 and recorded a 5-song demo. Further recordings under the name War &amp; Peace surfaced as &quot;Time Capsule&quot; in 1993, by which time the group had already disbanded. Pilson joined the McAuley Schenker Group for their 1991 album, &quot;M.S.G.&quot;. Afterwards, Pilson signed on with Dio for the &quot;Strange Highways&quot; album, reuniting with former Flesh &amp; Blood bandmate Vinny Appice.

Lynch&#x27;s first solo effort, 1993&#x27;s &quot;Sacred Groove&quot;, reunited him with Don Dokken for the writing of the track &quot;We Don&#x27;t Own This World.&quot; Don Dokken was also supposed to sing lead on the track, however at the last moment, Don was unable to attend the studio session and was replaced by Matthew and Gunnar Nelson. Jeff Pilson also collaborated with Lynch on the album, co-writing the lyrics to &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot; and playing bass on &quot;We Don&#x27;t Own This World&quot;.

===Reformation (1993–1997)===
After releasing &quot;Up from the Ashes&quot; in 1990 Don Dokken wrote another solo album in 1993. Titled &quot;Dysfunctional&quot;, the album was recorded and produced in Don&#x27;s studio. However, when John Kalodner wanted to sign him for the album, he suggested that George Lynch be brought back into the band so that the album could be marketed as a Dokken album, and not another Don Dokken solo effort. Despite the fact that the tension between Lynch and Don Dokken was the cause of the band&#x27;s 1989 split, the two agreed to put their problems behind them for the time being. The band re-united in 1994 along with Mick Brown and Jeff Pilson, with Lynch re-writing and re-recording the guitar solos on the album, which were originally conceived by Don. Dokken was signed with Columbia Records and the album managed to sell 300,000 copies despite the decline in popularity of similar bands during this time.

During the tour supporting &quot;Dysfunctional&quot;, old tensions between George and Don had resurfaced and the band began to split apart. During a Columbia promotion for the new album in which the band was scheduled to play live on 120 radio stations, Lynch unexpectedly left the studio and refused to re-enter. The record company was forced to air the rehearsal tape that had been recorded earlier and four days later the label dropped Dokken, presumably because of this and other similar incidents involving Lynch&#x27;s behavior. &quot;One Live Night&quot;, a live acoustic album, was released in 1996 by a new label, CMC International, and was followed with &quot;Shadowlife&quot; in 1997. Don Dokken was dissatisfied with &quot;Shadowlife&quot;, an album in which Lynch took total control and even went as far as to replace the original Dokken logo on the album. Don alleges that Lynch intended to destroy the band with this album, reciting the following quote from him in an interview: &quot;This is the perfect record. This is gonna be the end of Dokken, and that is what I wanted to accomplish.&quot;

===Line up changes (1997–2008)===
In late 1997, the band fired Lynch. Needing a guitarist, Dokken looked to Europe guitarist John Norum who had previously played on his 1990 solo album and was familiar with the band&#x27;s catalog, to help him finish the tour. Lynch tried to re-join the group just days before the tour began, but was told that he was &quot;out&quot; by the rest of the group. A lawsuit followed in which Lynch sued the band for $1 million, but the band prevailed in the verdict. After the European tour, John Norum was unable to continue as he had previously committed to a solo record. The band then hired former Winger guitarist Reb Beach, and recorded in 1999 the aptly titled &quot;Erase the Slate&quot;. Dokken released another live album titled &quot;Live from the Sun&quot; in 2000 before the departure of Beach.

Beach, who wanted to work on some other projects and could not commit to Dokken long term, was replaced by John Norum, who was now in between projects and able to participate in the band&#x27;s touring schedule. Bassist Jeff Pilson also left the band, replaced by Barry Sparks. In a 2004 interview, Don Dokken stated that Jeff left because &quot;he wanted to do something different and didn&#x27;t want to keep playing these songs over and over again.&quot; Of the original members, only Dokken and Mick Brown remained. This line-up released the album &quot;Long Way Home&quot;, but Norum suffered a hand injury during the band&#x27;s early-2002 tour of Europe and had to be replaced by former Dark Lord guitarist Alex De Rosso. That same year, Dokken was featured in the Metal Edge Rock Fest tour along with Ratt, FireHouse, and other similar acts. In the spring of 2003, Dokken embarked on an extensive tour of the United States, opening for Scorpions and Whitesnake. After the tour, guitarist Alex De Rosso lost his visa and had to return to Italy, at which point Don Dokken called Jon Levin who formerly played guitar on Doro&#x27;s &quot;Force Majeure&quot;, and also had previously met with the band and played a single show in 1998. Levin joined the band, and the line-up of Dokken, Brown, Levin, and Sparks would remain through 2008. Dokken released &quot;Hell to Pay&quot; in 2004, which was seen by critics as a modern approach to the band&#x27;s style. The band continued extensive touring in 2005 and 2006. 2007 saw the release of both a live CD and a compilation DVD. The CD, titled &quot;From Conception: Live 1981&quot;, is a previously unreleased live recording from the band&#x27;s early years which Don discovered in their master vault. The DVD release titled &quot;Unchain the Night&quot; was first released on VHS in 1986 and is a compilation of the band&#x27;s music videos along with interviews and other footage. The band also performed at the hard rock and metal festival Rocklahoma in both 2007 and 2008.

===Brief reunion (2008–2010)===
On May 13, 2008, Dokken released their first studio album in four years titled &quot;Lightning Strikes Again&quot;, which was met with critical acclaim along with increased commercial success and became the band&#x27;s highest-charting album in 13 years, debuting at No. 133 in the United States. The album was a return to the band&#x27;s signature sound and the songs follow the classic Dokken formula. Don Dokken told interviewers that Jon Levin was the bandmate who wanted the band to make an album with the classic sound in mind, and remarked that the process was difficult, saying: &quot;I had to get back in that mindset. This is what the fans wanted, and if I stay focused on that I would give them a straight-ahead Dokken record.&quot; During the spring and summer of 2008 in order to promote the new Dokken album, Don Dokken and Jon Levin participated in dozens of interviews including Rockline, KNAC, The Classic Metal Show, as well as a series of podcasts available on the band&#x27;s website.

During the summer of 2008, the band toured with Sebastian Bach and Poison. Sparks and Brown were not part of the summer 2008 touring line-up. Brown signed on to play with Ted Nugent for the summer before Dokken was offered the slot on the Poison tour, making him unable to tour in support of &quot;Lightning Strikes Again&quot;. Sparks was in Asia performing with a stadium act and was unable to tour with Dokken until he was able to get a visa for his wife. Chris McCarvill from House of Lords played bass. Jeff Martin of Racer X and Badlands played drums for the 2008 tour until he was fired by Don Dokken. Chris McCarvill&#x27;s House of Lords bandmate B.J. Zampa filled in as drummer for the remainder of the tour.

Since then Dokken have toured extensively with Mick Brown back on drums (BJ Zampa filling in on drums when Brown is busy touring with Ted Nugent). Sean McNabb formerly of Quiet Riot and Great White has remained on bass, along with Jon Levin on guitar and Don Dokken on vocals. In 2010, the band opened for the Scorpions on select dates of their US tour. On March 1, 2010 Dokken digitally released &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, a collection of re-recorded songs from their 1980s albums with two new tracks, to iTunes and Amazon.com. The physical album with additional tracks was released In Japan on King Records on April 21, 2010 and is available in the United States through Cleopatra Records.

On November 29, 2009 during an encore at a Dokken show at The House of Blues in Anaheim, George Lynch and Jeff Pilson joined Mick Brown and Don Dokken for two songs, the first time they were on stage together in 12 years.

In early 2010 Lynch announced a reunion of Dokken&#x27;s &quot;classic&quot; line-up, though the announcement was followed by a retraction on February 24. In May 2010 Lynch and Don Dokken appeared together as guests on Season 5, Episode 7 of television show &quot;That Metal Show&quot;. In the episode they claimed that the main cause of their rift was a publicity stunt that they both eventually started to believe. Lynch added that Don also wanting to &quot;take all the money and all the credit&quot; did not help, with Don nodding during the statement. They both also mentioned that they would love to have a reunion with Don, Lynch, Pilson, and Brown, but that they are all too busy with other projects in 2010 (between Dokken&#x27;s current lineup, Lynch Mob, Pilson&#x27;s involvement with Foreigner). Dokken and Lynch Mob toured through the summer and fall of 2010.

On December 8, 2010, Lynch announced on his web site and in interviews earlier that a Dokken reunion will not be happening. Lynch stated:
===&quot;Broken Bones&quot; (2011–2015)===
Dokken planned to release a new studio album in the fall 2012, with recording planned to finish by February and release before the band went on tour in June. The album would be released worldwide on Frontiers Records, which announced the signing of Dokken on November 22, 2011. Don Dokken announced the title of the new album to be &quot;Broken Bones&quot; and said the release date should be sometime in November 2012. They brought in session drummer Jimmy DeGrasso as Mick Brown couldn&#x27;t record due to scheduling conflicts which made this the first album he didn&#x27;t appear on in Dokken, although Brown has stated in interviews that Don simply didn&#x27;t want to pay to fly him in for the sessions. The album was released on September 25, 2012. In November 2014, Sean McNabb was replaced by one-time Ted Nugent bassist (and perennial lead singer of Yngwie Malmsteen&#x27;s Rising Force) Mark Boals.

It was revealed in June 2015 that Dokken would be part of the Rockingham lineup at Nottingham&#x27;s Rock City October 23–25. Dokken headlined on the Sunday, following Giuffria on stage. Other acts scheduled for that Sunday included Royal Hunt and Stan Bush.

===Reunion shows with classic lineup and &quot;Heaven Comes Down&quot; (2016–present)===
Don Dokken announced that he would be reuniting with George Lynch, Mick Brown and Jeff Pilson to perform several shows in Japan at the end of October 2016 and one US show at the end of September. In an interview with &quot;L.A. Weekly&quot; on March 6, 2017, Don Dokken said he is not planning any further appearances with Pilson and Lynch, stating that the Japan shows were &quot;a one-time thing.&quot; Despite this, the classic Dokken lineup recorded their first song together in over 20 years &quot;It&#x27;s Just Another Day&quot;; it can be found on the live album &quot;Return to the East Live (2016)&quot;, which was released on April 20, 2018.

When speaking to AllThatShreds.com in July 2017, Jon Levin said that the band is planning to enter the studio in the fall after touring to begin work on the next studio album for a 2018 release, which he described is the &quot;classic Dokken sound&quot;. Guitarist Ira Black filled in for Jon Levin on the latter half of the band&#x27;s 2017 tour. In July 2019, longtime drummer Mick Brown announced his retirement from Dokken after 40 years with the band, citing the toll of constant touring and feeling that he had grown too old for the demands of the road. His spot was later taken by BJ Zampa, also of House of Lords fame alongside bassist Chris McCarvill.

Dokken released an album called &quot;The Lost Songs: 1978-1981&quot; on August 28, 2020 via Silver Lining Music.

An album collection package titled &quot;The Elektra Albums 1983-1987&quot; was released on January 27, 2023, featuring the first four studio albums from the band&#x27;s career and also at their creative peak. The twelfth studio album &quot;Heaven Comes Down&quot; was released on October 27, 2023. A music video of the first single titled &quot;Fugitive&quot; was released on August 8, 2023.

<text>Dover is a town in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Located on the Rockaway River, Dover is about west of New York City and about west of Newark, New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the town&#x27;s population was 18,460, its highest decennial census count ever and an increase of 303 (+1.7%) from the 2010 census count of 18,157, which in turn had reflected a decline of 31 (−0.2%) from the 18,188 counted at the 2000 census.

Dover is a majority minority community, with nearly 70% of the population as of the 2010 census identifying themselves as Hispanic, up from 25% in 1980.

==History==
Joseph Latham was deeded the land that includes present-day Dover in 1713, from portions of land that had been purchased from Native Americans by the Proprietors of West Jersey. On May 31, 1722, Latham and his wife Jane deeded over to John Jackson of Flushing, New York. Jackson settled on the eastern portion of his land along Granny&#x27;s Brook at the site of what would later become the Ross Ribbon Factory on Park Heights Avenue.

Iron ore at the time was so plentiful that it could be collected off the ground at the nearby Dickerson Mine in Mine Hill. At Jackson&#x27;s Forge, ore would be processed into bars that would then be transported to Paterson and other industrial areas towards the east. The passage of the Iron Act by the British Parliament led to financial difficulties, leading Jackson into bankruptcy in 1753, with all of his property and belongings sold off at a Sheriff&#x27;s sale. Quaker Hartshorne Fitz Randolph purchased Jackson&#x27;s property and annexed to his own existing property, which would later become part of Randolph Township.

Dover was incorporated as a town on April 1, 1869, within Randolph Township and became fully independent as of March 5, 1896. The town charter was amended in 1875. On May 7, 1896, Dover was reincorporated as a city and regained its status as a town on March 21, 1899, after the referendum that approved the change was invalidated by a court ruling.

In its past, Dover has had extensive iron and mill works, machine shops, stove, furnace, and range works, boiler and bridge works, rolling mills, drill works, knitting and silk mills, and a large hosiery factory (MacGregors). During this period, Dover was a port on the Morris Canal while it was operational; the boat basin was located at what is today the JFK Commons Park.

Sources attribute the town&#x27;s name to Dover, England or Dover, New Hampshire.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town had a total area of 2.73 square miles (7.06 km2), including 2.68 square miles (6.93 km2) of land and 0.05 square miles (0.13 km2) of water (1.90%).

The borough borders the Morris County municipalities of Mine Hill Township, Randolph, Rockaway Township, Victory Gardens and Wharton.

==Demographics==
===2010 census===
The 2010 United States census counted 18,157 people, 5,562 households, and 3,877 families in the town. The population density was 6,765.5 per square mile (2,612.2/km2). There were 5,783 housing units at an average density of 2,154.8 per square mile (832.0/km2). The racial makeup was 66.55% (12,083) White, 6.10% (1,108) Black or African American, 0.63% (114) Native American, 2.54% (461) Asian, 0.05% (9) Pacific Islander, 19.88% (3,610) from other races, and 4.25% (772) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 69.38% (12,598) of the population.

Of the 5,562 households, 33.0% had children under the age of 18; 43.6% were married couples living together; 15.7% had a female householder with no husband present and 30.3% were non-families.

<text>Morristown () is a town in and the county seat of Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Morristown has been called &quot;the military capital of the American Revolution&quot; because of its strategic role in the war for independence from Great Britain. Morristown&#x27;s history is visible in a variety of locations that collectively make up Morristown National Historical Park, the country&#x27;s first National Historical Park.

Morristown was incorporated as a town by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on April 6, 1865, within Morris Township, and it was formally set off from the township in 1895. As of the 2020 United States census, the town&#x27;s population was 20,180, its highest decennial census count ever and an increase of 1,769 (+9.6%) from the 2010 census count of 18,411, which in turn had reflected a decline of 133 (−0.7%) from the 18,544 counted at the 2000 census.

According to British colonial records, the first permanent settlement in Morristown was New Hanover, founded in 1715 by colonists from New York and Connecticut. Morris County was created on March 15, 1739, from portions of Hunterdon County. The county, and ultimately Morristown itself, was named for the popular Governor of the Province, Lewis Morris, who championed land ownership rights for colonists.

== History ==

Present-day Morristown was initially inhabited by the Lenni Lenape Native Americans for up to 6,000 years prior to exploration of Europeans. The first European settlements in this portion of New Jersey were established by Sweden and the Netherlands in the early 17th century, when significant trade in furs existed between the natives and the Europeans at temporary posts. It became part New Netherland, a Dutch colony, but the English seized control of the region in 1664, which was granted to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton, and named the Province of New Jersey.

===18th century===
Morristown was settled around 1715 by English Presbyterians from Southold, New York, on Long Island and New Haven, Connecticut, as the village of New Hanover. The town&#x27;s central location and road connections led to its selection as the seat of the new Morris County shortly after its separation from Hunterdon County on March 15, 1739. The village and county were named for Lewis Morris, the first and then sitting royal governor of a united colony of New Jersey.

By the middle of the 18th century, Morristown had 250 residents, with two churches, a courthouse, two taverns, two schools, several stores, and numerous mills and farms nearby.

George Washington first came to Morristown in May 1773, two years before the Revolutionary War broke out, and traveled from there to New York City with John Parke Custis, his stepson, and Lord Stirling.

In 1777, General Washington and the Continental Army marched from the victories at Trenton and Princeton to encamp near Morristown from January to May. Washington&#x27;s headquarters during that first encampment was at Jacob Arnold&#x27;s Tavern, located at the Morristown Green in the center of Morristown. Morristown was selected for its extremely strategic location. It was between Philadelphia and New York and near New England while being protected by the Watchung Mountains from the bulk of British troops camped in New York City. It also was chosen for the skills and trades of the residents, local industries and natural resources to provide arms, and what was thought to be the ability of the community to provide enough food to support the army.

The churches were used for inoculations for smallpox. That first headquarters, Arnold&#x27;s Tavern, was eventually moved south of the green onto Mount Kemble Avenue to become All Souls&#x27; Hospital in the late 19th century. It suffered a fire in 1918, and the original structure was demolished, but new buildings for the hospital were built directly across the street.

From December 1779 to June 1780, the Continental Army&#x27;s second encampment at Morristown was at Jockey Hollow. Then, Washington&#x27;s headquarters in Morristown was located at the Ford Mansion, a large mansion near what was then the edge of town. Ford&#x27;s widow and children shared the house with Martha Washington and officers of the Continental Army.

The winter of 1780 was the worst winter of the Revolutionary War. The starvation was complicated by extreme inflation of money and lack of pay for the army. The entire Pennsylvania contingent successfully mutinied. Later, 200 New Jersey soldiers also attempted unsuccessfully to mutiny. Many soldiers died, due to weak health.

During Washington&#x27;s second stay, in March 1780, he declared St. Patrick&#x27;s Day a holiday to honor his many Irish troops. Martha Washington traveled from Virginia and remained with her husband each winter throughout the war. The Marquis de Lafayette came to Washington in Morristown to inform him that France would be sending ships and trained soldiers to aid the Continental Army.

Ford Mansion, Jockey Hollow, and Fort Nonsense are all preserved as part of Morristown National Historical Park, managed by the National Park Service, which has the distinction among historic preservationists of being the first National Historical Park established in the United States.

During Washington&#x27;s stay, Benedict Arnold was court-martialed at Dickerson&#x27;s Tavern, on Spring Street, for charges related to profiteering from military supplies at Philadelphia. His admonishment was made public, but Washington quietly promised the hero, Arnold, to make it up to him.

Alexander Hamilton courted and wed Elizabeth Schuyler at a residence where Washington&#x27;s personal physician resided. Locally known as the Schuyler-Hamilton House, the Dr. Jabez Campfield House is listed on both the New Jersey and National Register of Historic Places.

At Morristown Green, there is a statue commemorating the meeting of George Washington, the young Marquis de LaFayette, and young Alexander Hamilton as they discussed forthcoming aid from French ships and troops being sent by King Louis XVI to aid the Continental Army in the Revolutionary War.

Morristown&#x27;s Burnham Park has a statue, &quot;Father of the American Revolution&quot;, depicting Thomas Paine, who wrote &quot;Common Sense&quot; in 1776, which urged a complete break from British rule and helped inspire the American Revolution. The bronze statue by sculptor Georg J. Lober shows Paine in 1776 using a drum as a table during the withdrawal of the army across New Jersey composing &quot;Crisis 1&quot;. He wrote, &quot;These are the times that try men&#x27;s souls...&quot; The statue was dedicated on July 4, 1950.

=== 19th century ===
The idea for constructing the Morris Canal is credited to Morristown businessman George P. Macculloch, who in 1822 convened a group to discuss his concept for a canal. The group included Governor of New Jersey Isaac Halstead Williamson, which led to approval of the proposal by the New Jersey Legislature later that year. The canal was used for a century.
In July 1825 during his 15 month return tour of the United States, the Marquis de Lafayette returned to Morristown, where a ball was held in his honor at the 1807 Sansay House on DeHart Street (the edifice still stands as of 2011).

In 1827, St. Peter&#x27;s Episcopal Church was founded at the behest of Bishop George Washington Doane and many prominent Morristown Families, including George P. Macculloch, of the Morris Canal. When the Church was rebuilt by the then-internationally famous architectural firm, McKim, Mead and White, beginning in 1889, the congregation erected one of the United States finest church buildings –a stone, English-gothic church complete with fined stained glass, and a long, decorated interior.

Antoine le Blanc, a French immigrant laborer, murdered the Sayre family and their servant (or possibly slave), Phoebe. He was tried and convicted of murder of the Sayres (but not of Phoebe) on August 13, 1833. On September 6, 1833, Le Blanc became the last person hanged on the Morristown Green. Until late 2006, the house where the murders were committed was known as &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s Haunt,&quot; which is purported to be haunted by Phoebe&#x27;s ghost because her murder never saw justice. Jimmy&#x27;s Haunt was torn down to make way for a bank in 2007.

Samuel F. B. Morse and Alfred Vail built the first telegraph at the Speedwell Ironworks in Morristown on January 6, 1838. The first telegraph message was &quot;A patient waiter is no loser&quot;. The first public demonstration of the invention occurred five days later as an early step toward the Information Age.

Jacob Arnold&#x27;s Tavern, the first headquarters for Washington in Morristown and site of Benedict Arnold&#x27;s 1780 trial, was purchased by Morristown historian Julia Keese Nelson Colles (1840-1913) to save it from demolition in 1886. It was moved by horse-power in the winter of 1887 from &quot;the green&quot; (after being stuck on Bank Street for about six weeks) to a site south on Mount Kemble Avenue at what is now a parking lot for the Atlantic RIMM Rehabilitation Hospital. It became a boarding house for four years until it was converted by the Grey Nuns from Montreal into All Souls&#x27; Hospital, the first general hospital in Morris County. George and Martha Washington&#x27;s second floor ballroom became a chapel and the first floor tavern became a ward for patients. In 1910, the late Augustus Lefebvre Revere (brother of hospital founder Paul Revere) willed the Hospital $10,000 to be used for the erection of a new building. This fund was used 8 years later when the original Arnold&#x27;s Tavern building was lost to a fire. The entire organization, nurses, doctors, and patients of All Souls&#x27; Hospital were then moved across Mount Kemble Avenue, U.S. Route 202, to the newly built brick hospital building. All Souls&#x27; was set to close because of financial difficulties in the late 1960s. In 1973, it became Community Medical Center. In 1977, the center became bankrupt and was purchased by the then new and larger Morristown Memorial Hospital, which is now the Morristown Medical Center.

On December 18, 1843, the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church was incorporated. This was the first congregation established by blacks in Morris County. It is still active. The first site of the Church was located at 13 Spring Street and served as the only schoolhouse for colored children until 1870. The Church relocated to its present site at 59 Spring Street in 1874.

The first Jews moved to Morristown in the 1850s, but much larger numbers of Ashkenazi Jews migrated to the region from Eastern Europe in the 1890s, which led to the incorporation of the Morristown Jewish Center in 1899. Today there are several Jewish synagogues in Morristown reflecting the diversity of the community.

In the 1880s, the town&#x27;s residents were primarily farmers. The small amount of stores in the Morristown Green town center were only open during the evening to accommodate farmers who did not leave their work during the daytime. There were only a few stores in town, including Adams &amp; Fairchild grocers and P. H. Hoffman &amp; Son clothiers, both located in the Arnold&#x27;s Tavern on the Morristown Green.

=== Gilded Age of Morristown ===

Starting in the mid-1800s, Morristown became a popular summer retreat for some of New York City&#x27;s wealthiest residents. From the 1870s onwards, immense estates were built up along once rural thoroughfares; Madison Avenue, which runs along Morristown and Madison, New Jersey, became known as &quot;the street of the 100 millionaires&quot; due to the sheer extravagance of the houses that were constructed.

Between 1880 and 1929, the Gilded Age of Morristown occurred, when dozens of &quot;millionaires with large fortunes built their estates&quot; in Morristown and Morris Township.

In the 1880 United States census, the town had 5,418 residents, which grew to 8,156 in 1890.

In 1889, Christian charity organization Market Street Mission was established on 9 Market Street beside the Morristown Green in response to the large number of saloons on Market Street. Beginning on March 18, 1889, the Mission hosted nightly meetings to aid and convert those with alcoholism, opioid use, and homelessness. As of 2022, the organization continues to operate a homeless shelter, meals, and emergency services, along with men&#x27;s drug addiction recovery groups, community counseling, a chapel, and a thrift store.

Morris Township describes the influx of millionaires to the area:By 1896, an estimated 54 millionaires lived in the Morristown area, with a total wealth of $289,000,000, which [circa 2009] would be worth billions of dollars. Six years later in 1902, there were at least 91 millionaires.This included New York warehouse and grain broker Charles Grant Foster, who bought the farm estate and mansion of Union Army general Joseph Warren Revere in 1881. This became Fosterfields, a Jersey cow farm. It was later managed by Caroline Rose Foster, though most of its herd was sold in a 1927 auction. In 1979 it was donated to the Morris County Park Commission. The site currently houses a living history museum and Revere&#x27;s historic house.

In 1902, the &quot;New York Herald&quot; described Morristown as &quot;the Millionaire City of the Nation.&quot; The &quot;Herald&quot; claimed it &quot;contains the richest and least known colony of wealthy people in the world.&quot; It identified 45 millionaires (15 of whom were worth over $10 million) who had purchased country homes in Morristown to avoid &quot;lavish display&quot; and seek &quot;freedom from notoriety.&quot; The newspaper named some of them including lawyer George Griswold Frelinghuysen, carpet-making heir Eugene Higgins, banker Otto Hermann Kahn, Luther Kountze, and Louis A. Thebaud.

Even smaller estates without deer herds, polo fields or private gas plants necessitated &quot;multiple indoor and outdoor employees&quot; such as &quot;butlers, housekeeprs, parlor-maids and upstairs maids; governesses, nannies, and tutors; cooks and kitchen maids, coachmen, grooms, and stable boys; managers, care-takers, watchmen; gardeners and assistants.&quot;

The Gilded Age of Morristown ended in 1929, due to the &quot;high cost of maintaining the estates, increasing income taxes, and the stock market crash&quot; that led to the Great Depression. The Morris Township reports, &quot;Many of the mansions were closed or sold, and some burned.&quot;

===20th century===

Since 1929, more than 16,000 guide dogs for the blind from The Seeing Eye, Inc., the oldest such school in the U.S., have been trained on the streets of Morristown.
===21st century===
On January 5, 2009, five red lights were spotted in the Morristown area night skies, who gained significant press coverage and 9-1-1 calls. On April 1, 2009, the perpetrators revealed their hoax by publicizing footage of its creation, which consisted of helium balloons and flares. The event became nationally known as the Morristown UFO hoax.

==Government==
===Local government===
Morristown is governed within the Faulkner Act, formally known as the Optional Municipal Charter Law, under a Plan F Mayor-Council system of New Jersey municipal government, which went into effect on January 1, 1974. The town is one of 71 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. The Morristown Town Council is comprised of seven members, of which three members are elected at-large representing the entire town and one representative is chosen from each of the town&#x27;s four wards. Members are elected on a partisan basis to four-year terms of office on a staggered basis in odd-numbered years as part of the November general election, with the four ward seats up for vote together and the at-large and mayoral seats up for vote together two years later. As the legislative arm of the government, the council is responsible for making and setting policy for the town.

, the Mayor of Morristown is Democrat Timothy Dougherty, whose term of office ends December 31, 2025. Members of the Morristown Town Council are Council President Nathan Umbriac (D; At Large, 2025), Council Vice President David Silva (D; At Large, 2025), Toshiba Foster (D; At Large, 2025), Robert Iannaccone (I, Ward I, 2027), Tina Lindsey (D, Ward II, 2027), Steven Pylypchuk (D, Ward III, 2027), and Christopher Russo (D; Ward IV, 2027).

While Mount Arlington is now mostly a suburban residential community, it was once a thriving resort community. In the era before the world wars and the advent of air travel, it was a welcome respite for the residents of nearby New York City and Newark.

Every summer, thousands would arrive by train at Landing Station, and then travel by water taxi across Lake Hopatcong to the area&#x27;s many large resort hotels to escape the city heat and enjoy the famous &quot;Mount Arlington breeze&quot; which always cooled the summer evenings. There was also a major amusement park, Bertrand Island, which featured a world-famous carousel and roller coaster, which operated until the park was closed in 1983.

Mount Arlington was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on November 3, 1890, from portions of Roxbury, based on the results of a referendum held two days earlier. Additional territory was acquired from Roxbury on July 25, 1891, on May 31, 1893, and on May 31, 1894. The borough is named for Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington.

In March 2014, members of the public petitioned the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs to form the Roxbury Mount Arlington Study Commission to consider a possible consolidation of Mount Arlington and the neighboring municipality of Roxbury. In March 2015, the commission was formed with five members and two alternates from each municipality. If the commission votes to recommend a merger, the decision would have to be ratified by a referendum of the voters in each community.

==Government==

===Local government===
Effective January 1, 1972, the voters in the Township approved a change to a Mayor-Council form of government, governed by a directly elected mayor and a seven-member Township Council elected on an at-large basis. The mayor operates the government with the assistance of a Township Administrator, with the Council performing a legislative role. Starting from its inception in 1871, Mount Olive had been governed under the Township form of municipal government, by a three-person Township Committee, which was expanded to five members in 1968.

Mount Olive Township is governed under the Optional Municipal Charter Law&#x27;s (Faulkner Act) Mayor-Council form of government (Plan E), enacted based on the recommendations of a Charter Study Commission. The governing body is comprised of the Mayor and the Township Council and provides for a &quot;strong mayor&quot;, with a separately elected mayor and council. The township is one of 71 municipalities (of the 564) statewide that use this form of government. The mayor, who is elected directly by the voters, is the Chief Executive Officer of the Township. The Mayor is responsible for carrying out all Council decisions and for the day-to-day operation of all functions of the municipality. The Township Council is comprised of seven members, who are elected on an at-large basis with staggered terms in elections held in odd-numbered years with either three seats or four seats coming up for vote; the mayor is up for election the same year that three council seats are up for vote. The Township Council is the legislative branch of the government and is responsible for approving the municipal budget and enacting ordinances. The council elects a Council President from among its members at an annual reorganization meeting. The Council President presides at all council meetings.

, the Mayor of Mount Olive Township is Republican Robert Greenbaum, whose term of office ends December 31, 2023. Members of the Township Council are Council President Joe Nicastro (R, 2023), Council Vice President Alex Roman (R, 2023), Charles Aaron Jr. (R, 2025; appointed to serve an unexpired term), John Ferrante (R, 2025), Colleen Labow (R, 2023), John Mania (R, 2025) and Gregory Stewart (R, 2025).

In January 2023, Chuck Aaron was sworn in to fill the seat expiring in December 2025 that became vacant following the death of Daniel Amianda the previous November. Aaron will serve on an interim basis until the November 2023 general election, when voters will select a candidate to fill the balance of the term of office.

In July 2015, the Township Council selected Gregory Stewart from three candidates nominated by the Republican municipal committee to fill the seat expiring in December 2017 that had been held by Ray Perkins until his resignation from office to move out of the township, after having served 13 years in office; Stewart will serve on an interim basis until the November 2016 general election, when voters will choose a candidate to serve the one year remaining on the term of office.

Serving a term ending December 2013, Patrick Walsh resigned from office in February 2013, citing internal conflicts in the township&#x27;s Republican Party government.

<text>Mountain Lakes is a borough in Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, and a suburb of New York City. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 4,472, an increase of 312 (+7.5%) from the 2010 census count of 4,160, which in turn had reflected a decline of 96 (−2.3%) from the 4,256 recorded at the 2000 census.

Originally a planned community, the borough was named for a pair of lakes which served to distinguish Mountain Lakes as &quot;the first year-round residential lake community in northwestern New Jersey.&quot; Mountain Lakes was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 3, 1924, from portions of Boonton Township and Hanover Township, subject to the results of a referendum passed on April 29, 1924.

The borough has been one of the state&#x27;s highest-income communities. In the 2013–2017 American Community Survey, Mountain Lakes had a median household income of $175,556 (ranked 12th in the state) and included 45.6% of households earning more than $200,000 annually.

In 2010, Forbes.com listed Mountain Lakes as 210th in its listing of &quot;America&#x27;s Most Expensive ZIP Codes&quot;, with a median home price of $1,045,401.

Mountain Lakes ranked among the highest annual property tax bills in New Jersey, and was the highest in Morris County, at $20,471 in 2018, compared to a statewide average of $8,767. &quot;New Jersey Monthly&quot; magazine ranked Mountain Lakes as the 26th best place to live in New Jersey in its rankings of the &quot;New Jersey&#x27;s Top Towns 2011–2012&quot; in New Jersey.

The Mountain Lakes station provides NJ Transit commuter train service. The station offers service on the Montclair-Boonton Line and is the first train station heading eastbound not concurrent with the nearby Morris &amp; Essex Lines.

==History==
Mountain Lakes was originally a planned community, founded in 1910 by Herbert Hapgood. The entire face of the community changed from a wilderness of Dutch and English properties to a planned suburban community of large stucco houses now affectionately known as &quot;Hapgoods.&quot; During this single decade, the natural and architectural character of Mountain Lakes was developed. Hapgood was particularly influenced by the Arts and Crafts movement, at the height of its popularity in 1910 when he started building.

Lawrence W. Luellen, inventor of the Dixie Cup, became the community&#x27;s first resident when he moved to his new home in March 1911.

The Hapgood model homes were early forerunners of the modern development, but each house was modified to suit individual tastes. To the basic styles of these houses, Hapgood added colonial and craftsman features. He reversed floor plans, and interchanged architectural details. By the end of 1912, two hundred Hapgood homes were sold and occupied and in 1914 saw the formation of the Mountain Lakes Club. By 1923, approximately six hundred stucco houses were built to meet the overwhelming demand. Mountain Lakes became an independent municipality in 1924.

The United States Navy&#x27;s Underwater Sound Reference Laboratories was located in Mountain Lakes during World War II.

Mountain Lakes had a discriminatory &quot;gentleman&#x27;s agreement&quot; from its inception up through the 1960s, preventing African-Americans, Jews, Latinos, Catholics, and other &quot;undesirable groupings&quot; from living there. While this was abandoned in recent years, the town still has a less diverse population than the rest of New Jersey, or Morris County.

Mountain Lakes is home to historic Grimes Homestead; an 18th-century home that served as a way station on the Underground Railroad.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 2.91 square miles (7.53 km2), including 2.64 square miles (6.84 km2) of land and 0.27 square miles (0.69 km2) of water (9.11%).

Part of The Tourne county park is in Mountain Lakes.

The borough borders Parsippany-Troy Hills, to the east and south, the town of Boonton to the northeast, Boonton Township to the northwest and Denville to the west all of which are located in Morris County.

===Lakes===
Man-made lakes in Mountain Lakes include Birchwood Lake, Crystal Lake, Mountain Lake, Shadow Lake, Sunset Lake, Wildwood Lake, and Cove Lake. There are town private swimming beaches in Birchwood Lake, and Mountain Lake. The Mountain Lakes Club is located on the northern end of Mountain Lake.

Beaches are open from sunrise to sunset and facilities are available between the hours of 10 am and 6 pm every day between the months of June and August with a beach badge purchased at the borough hall. Beach badges are available to Mountain Lakes residents only.

==Demographics==

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, a diverse group of foreigners have been moving to the borough, including Germans, Chinese, South Africans, and New Zealanders.

<text>Netcong is a borough in southwestern Morris County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States census, the borough&#x27;s population was 3,375, an increase of 143 (+4.4%) from the 2010 census count of 3,232, which in turn reflected an increase of 652 (+25.3%) from the 2,580 counted in the 2000 census. Netcong lies on the shores of Lake Musconetcong.

Established as South Stanhope by workers employed as miners in Stanhope, the name &quot;Netcong&quot; was adopted for the community in 1889 when a post office used the name. Netcong was incorporated as a borough by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on October 23, 1894, from portions of both Mount Olive Township and Roxbury Township, based on the results of a referendum held the previous day.

==History==
Netcong received its name from the Musconetcong River, named by the Lenape Native Americans and meaning &quot;grass creek&quot;, &quot;swamp stream&quot;, &quot;rapid stream&quot; or &quot;clear stream place&quot;. Along with the river, the proximity of the old Morris and Sussex Turnpike, which passed through the region shortly after 1801, and the coming of the Morris Canal, in 1831, made the site a favorable one for development.

After becoming a borough, the residents had to elect the first governing body. The first mayor was Abraham J. Drake, elected November 14, 1894. A census of Netcong taken July 1895 showed a population of 877 people.

Netcong derived much of its business from the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, which had its last stop in Morris County in the heart of the borough. The DL&amp;W&#x27;s Sussex Branch to Branchville also stopped at Netcong Station, with the Sussex Branch coming into the opposite side of the station from where NJ Transit&#x27;s line is today. The big railroad roundhouse in Port Morris also supplied many jobs for the town residents.

In 1968, AT&amp;T announced that the company would be building a two-story building in the borough at the bottom of a hole underground. The facility, designed to connect a cable running between Boston and Miami, was designed to withstand a nuclear attack and continue 24-hour operations for as long as three weeks using supplies and generating capacity on the site.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough had a total area of 0.96 square miles (2.49 km2), including 0.83 square miles (2.16 km2) of land and 0.13 square miles (0.33 km2) of water (13.33%).

==Patron saint==
The patron saint of the borough is St. Cesario deacon and martyr of Terracina. In 1893 some Italian immigrants left their hometown of Cesa, a province of Caserta (Italy), to come to the United States. They settled in Netcong, attracted by job opportunities at the Singer Steel Foundry, and in the construction of the railroad which was replacing the Morris Canal as a means of transportation. They established the &quot;St. Cesario Society&quot; in 1902 in honor of their hometown&#x27;s patron saint, Cesario deacon and martyr. Saint Cesario is venerated in St. Michael Church of Netcong; a bone fragment with the Latin cartouche &quot;ex ossibus S. Caesarii diac. m.&quot; is preserved in this church, set in a silver reliquary, solemnly exposed on the high altar for the feast, celebrated on the penultimate Saturday of July. In Saint Michael&#x27;s Church also includes a wooden statue of St. Cesario, a stained glass window and an icon (in the Sacristy) depicting the martyr.

On June 6, 2019, the mayor of Netcong, Joe Nametko, signed the Pact of Sister Cities with Cesa, in honor of St. Cesario.

==Transportation==

===Roads and highways===

, the borough had a total of of roadways, of which were maintained by the municipality, by Morris County and by the New Jersey Department of Transportation.

Several major highways pass through Netcong, leading to the borough&#x27;s motto of &quot;All Roads Lead to Netcong&quot;. Major roadways in Netcong include Interstate 80 (the Bergen-Passaic Expressway), U.S. Route 46 and Route 183, the latter two highways meeting at the Netcong Circle. The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) uses Netcong as a control city on directional signage on its highways throughout northern New Jersey, and as far away as the George Washington Bridge, even though less than one-tenth of a mile of Interstate 80 is in the borough (from mile markers 26.33 to 26.42). Interstate 80 and U.S. Route 206 intersect with U.S. Route 46 in the southwest corner of the borough at Exit 26.

In 2007, the New Jersey Department of Transportation proposed the elimination of the Netcong Traffic Circle, located at the intersections of U.S. Route 46 and Route 183 just north of the interchange with Interstate 80, and its replacement with a signalized intersection. The circle itself dated back to construction in 1938 and was unable to handle the 17,000 vehicles a year that used the large roadway daily. The circle was the frequent site of vehicular accidents, including a total of 81 in 2007 and 2008. The project had issues dealing with the vertical clearance of the overpass for U.S. Route 46 westbound. The removal of the circle would eliminate this bridge, and the land would go to use as the new signalized intersection, with pedestrian and bicycle fittings. The entire project cost about $13.3 million of state and local funds to construct. A temporary interchange was implemented in January 2013, with the permanent intersection configuration completed that August.

===Public transportation===

NJ Transit operates weekday rail service at the Netcong station to Hoboken Terminal, with service to Penn Station in New York City via Midtown Direct on the Montclair-Boonton Line and the Morris &amp; Essex Lines.

NJ Transit used to provide local service on the MCM5 route. The Morris County Department of Transportation provides bus service along Route 46 to Dover and Mount Olive Township.

Lakeland Bus Lines provides service along Route 80 between Newton and the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Midtown Manhattan.

In view of Netcong&#x27;s rich railroad history, the borough has been named as a site for the New Jersey State Railroad and Transportation Museum (jointly with Phillipsburg). Given that the site envisioned for this museum in Phillipsburg has been sold for development as a townhouse complex and college campus annex, it is unclear what role Phillipsburg will play in this museum. Funding will need to be secured in order to build and operate this museum.

<text>Parsippany–Troy Hills, commonly known as Parsippany ( ), is a township in Morris County, in the northern portion of the U.S. state of New Jersey. As of the 2020 United States Census, the township&#x27;s population was 56,162, an increase of 2,924 (+5.5%) from the 2010 census count of 53,238, which in turn had reflected an increase of 2,589 (+5.1%) from the 50,649 counted at the 2000 census.

The name, Parsippany, comes from the Lenape Native American sub-tribe, which comes from the word &quot;parsipanong&quot;, which means &quot;the place where the river winds through the valley.&quot; Parsippany–Troy Hills is the most populous municipality in Morris County. The name Troy Hills was changed from Troy to avoid confusion of mail being sent erroneously to Troy, New York.

Parsippany–Troy Hills was incorporated as a township by an act of the New Jersey Legislature on March 12, 1928, from portions of Hanover Township, based on the results of a referendum held on May 9, 1928, that split off both East Hanover Township and Parsippany–Troy Hills from Hanover Township.

Since 2006, Parsippany–Troy Hills appeared eight times on &quot;Money&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;Best Places to Live in the United States&quot;, ranking 17th-best in 2006, 13th-best in 2008, 15th-best in 2012, 17th-best in 2014, fifth-best in 2016, 33rd-best in 2017, 26th-best in 2018, and 15th-best in 2022.

==History==
After the Wisconsin Glacier melted around 13,000 BCE, half of Parsippany was filled with water, as this was Lake Passaic. Around the area, grasses grew, as the area was tundra, and then turned into a taiga/boreal forest as the area warmed.

===Native Americans===
Paleo-Indians moved in small groups into the area around 12,500 years ago, attracted by the diversity of plant and animal life.

Native Americans relocated to the area several thousand years ago, dwelling in the highlands and along the Rockaway River and the Whippany River, where they hunted and fished for the various game that lived in the area and migrated through the area in autumn. Paintings in a rock cave were found in the late 1970s in western Parsippany in the highlands.

=== Dutch settlement ===
From 1611 to 1614, the Netherlands established the colony of New Netherland, which claimed territory between the 40th and 45th parallels north, a zone that included all of North Jersey. Native Americans traded furs and food with the Dutch for various goods, including metal pots, knives, guns, axes, and blankets. Trading with the Native Americans occurred until 1643, when a series of wars broke out between them. There were hostile relations between the Dutch and Native Americans between 1643 and 1660, which prevented the colonization by the Dutch of present-day Morris County.

On August 27, 1664, three English ships approached Fort Amsterdam, and surrendered the fort to the English. The English took control of New Netherland, and Morris County was included in the colonial-era Province of New York.

Relations with the Native Americans improved briefly after New Jersey&#x27;s independent establishment. In a war between the Dutch and British ten years later. However, the Dutch retook control of New Amsterdam. A year later, it returned to the British. Relations with the Native Americans and English improved for a while. Settlers from England began moving to the area around 1700. The Parsippany area had flat land and fertile soil, and a fresh water supply, which created a suitable location for successful farming.

===Slavery in Parsippany===

From the 1730s until the beginning of the 19th century, present-day Parsippany was known as Lake Hiawatha, and included a 2,000-acre (3.125 mile) slave plantation. The central street of Lake Hiawatha, Beverwyck Road, references the name of a Dutch slave owner and property manager, Lucas Von Beverhoudt.

Generations of African slaves were forced to labor on the Beverwyck property, including Phebe Ann Jacobs. Born enslaved in 1785 on the Beverwyck plantation, she later achieved freedom in Maine, laundering clothes for students of Bowdoin College. Her 1856 biography, &quot;Narrative of Phebe Ann Jacobs,&quot; published posthumously, was a source of inspiration to Harriet Beecher Stowe, who authored &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, an anti-slavery novel.

A 1768 newspaper advertisement for the property mentions a &quot;Negro House,&quot; which was constructed to house over 20 slaves, including a blacksmith, a shoemaker, and a mason. A 1780 newspaper notice includes a description to aid in re-capturing &quot;Jack,&quot; a slave who had escaped; this notice can be found at the Morristown National Historical Park.

Guests at the estate included George Washington, Nathaniel Greene, and Marquis de Lafayette.

==Geography==
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the township had a total area of 25.35 square miles (65.65 km2), including 23.63 square miles (61.20 km2) of land and 1.72 square miles (4.45 km2) of water (6.79%).

Unincorporated communities, localities and place names located partially or completely within the township include Greystone Park, Lake Hiawatha, Lake Intervale, Lake Parsippany, Mount Tabor (also known as &quot;Tabor&quot;), Parsippany, Powder Mill, Rainbow Lakes, Rockaway Neck, and Troy Hills.

Lake Hiawatha and Mount Tabor are neighborhoods with their own ZIP codes. In 2000, 55% of Parsippany residents had a 07054 ZIP code. In 2011, Parsippany residents could live in one of 12 ZIP codes. Until 2000, there was a 13th ZIP code within Parsippany, eliminated with changes at the Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital.

Parsippany borders the municipalities of Boonton, Denville, East Hanover, Hanover, Montville, Morris Plains, Morris Township, Mountain Lakes and Randolph.

===Climate===
The township has a humid continental climate, with cold winters and very warm-to-hot summers. It is usually cooler than Manhattan at night and in the early morning. The record low temperature is , and the record high is .

===Geology===
Parsippany–Troy Hills lies in the Newark Piedmont Basin. Around 500 million years ago, a chain of volcanic islands crashed into proto North America, riding over the North American Plate and creating the New Jersey Highlands, which start in the western portion of the township. This strike also created land formations in the rest of eastern New Jersey. Around 450 million years ago, a small continent, long and thin, collided with North America, creating folding and faulting in western New Jersey and southern Appalachia.

The swamps and meadows of Parsippany were created when the North American Plate separated from the African Plate. An aborted rift system or half-graben was created. The land area lowered between the Ramapo Fault in western Parsippany and a fault west of Paterson. The Ramapo Fault goes through the western part of the township.

The Wisconsin Glacier came into the area around 21,000 BCE and left around 13,000 BCE due to a warming in climate. As the glacier slowly melted, this created rivers, streams and lakes, leaving most of the township under Lake Passaic, which was the biggest lake in New Jersey at that time, stretching from the edge of the Ramapo Fault in western Parsippany eastward to almost Paterson.

The area was first a tundra when the Wisconsin Glacier melted and then as the area warmed formed taiga/boreal forests, along with vast meadows. Slowly, Lake Passaic drained and formed swamps in the township; Troy Meadows and Lee Meadows (on the old Alderney Farm tract) are perfect examples. Swamps and meadows next to oak forests created a diverse flora and fauna spectrum.

==Demographics==
