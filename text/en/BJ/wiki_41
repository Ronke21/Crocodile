<text>Clarence William Nelson II (born September 29, 1942) is an American politician, attorney, and former astronaut who served from 2001 to 2019 as a United States senator from Florida and from 2021 to 2025 as the administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). A member of the Democratic Party, Nelson served from 1979 to 1991 as a U.S. representative from Florida&#x27;s Space Coast, and from 1972 to 1978 as a member of the Florida House of Representatives. In January 1986, he became the second sitting member of Congress to fly in space, after Senator Jake Garn, when he served as a payload specialist on mission STS-61-C aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot;. Before entering politics he served in the United States Army Reserve during the Vietnam War.

Nelson retired from Congress in 1990 to run for governor of Florida, but was unsuccessful. He was later elected Treasurer, Insurance Commissioner, and Fire Marshal of Florida, serving from 1995 to 2001. In 2000, Nelson was elected to the U.S. Senate seat that had been vacated by retiring Republican senator Connie Mack III with 51% of the vote. He was reelected in 2006 with 60% of the vote and in 2012 with 55% of the vote. Nelson ran in 2018 for a fourth term, but narrowly lost to then-Governor Rick Scott. In May 2019, Nelson was appointed to serve on NASA&#x27;s advisory council.

In the U.S. Senate, Nelson was generally considered a centrist and a moderate Democrat. He supported same-sex marriage, lowering taxes on lower and middle income families, expanding environmental programs and regulation, protecting the Affordable Care Act, and expanding Medicaid. Nelson chaired the Senate Aging Committee from 2013 to 2015, and served as ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee from 2015 to 2019.

On March 19, 2021, President Joe Biden announced his intention to nominate Nelson to the position of Administrator of NASA. On April 29, the Senate confirmed Nelson by unanimous consent. He was sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris on May 3. Nelson left NASA on January 20, 2025, at the end of Biden&#x27;s presidency.

== Early life and education ==
Nelson was born on September 29, 1942, in Miami, Florida, the only child of Nannie Merle and Clarence William Nelson. His father was a real estate investor and a lawyer. He is of Scottish, Irish, English, and Danish descent. His father died of a heart attack when Nelson was 14 and his mother of Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease (ALS) when he was 24.
Nelson grew up in Melbourne, Florida, where he attended Melbourne High School.

Nelson attended Baptist and Episcopal churches, but later was baptized through immersion in a Baptist church. He served as International President of Kiwanis-sponsored Key Club International (1959–1960). In 2005, he joined the First Presbyterian Church in Orlando.

Nelson attended the University of Florida, where he was a member of Florida Blue Key and Beta Theta Pi social fraternity. He transferred to Yale University after two years at the University of Florida. At Yale he would be roommates with Bruce Smathers, the son of Florida senator George Smathers. Nelson received a Bachelor of Arts with a major in political science from Yale University in 1965 and a Juris Doctor from the University of Virginia in 1968.

In 1965, during the Vietnam War, Nelson joined the United States Army Reserve. He served on active duty from 1968 to 1970, attaining the rank of Captain, and he remained in the Army until 1971. Nelson was admitted to the Florida Bar in 1968, and began practicing law in Melbourne in 1970. In 1971, he worked as legislative assistant to Governor Reubin Askew.

== Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; ==
In 1986, Nelson became the second sitting member of Congress (and the first member of the House) to travel into space. He went through NASA training with fellow &quot;congressional observer&quot; Senator Jake Garn, who flew on STS-51-D in 1985. Nelson served as a payload specialist on &#x27;s STS-61-C mission from January 12 to 18, 1986. Coincidentally, STS-61-C&#x27;s pilot was Charles Bolden, who also went on to serve as a NASA administrator. Gregory Jarvis was originally scheduled to be on this flight, but he was reassigned to STS-51-L and replaced by Nelson; Jarvis, along with the six others on STS-51-L, died in the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, ten days after STS-61-C&#x27;s mission ended.

In 1988, Nelson published a book about his space flight experience, &quot;Mission: An American Congressman&#x27;s Voyage to Space&quot;.

== Early political career ==
=== Florida Legislature ===

In 1972, Nelson was elected to the Florida House of Representatives as the member from the 47th district, representing much of Brevard County and portions of Orange County and Seminole County. He won reelection in 1974 and 1976.

=== U.S. House of Representatives ===
Nelson was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1978 in the open 9th congressional district after the five-term Republican incumbent, Louis Frey Jr., chose to run for governor of Florida rather than for reelection.

In 1980, Nelson was reelected to that district, which encompassed all of Brevard and part of Orange County. He was redistricted to the 11th congressional district, encompassing all of Brevard and parts of Orange, Indian River, and Osceola counties; he won reelection in 1982, 1984, 1986, and 1988. He remained a member of the U.S. House of Representatives until 1991.

Nelson chaired the House Space Subcommittee for six years as a key member of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology. His district included Cape Canaveral and its space facility. In 1988, Bill Nelson criticized President Reagan&#x27;s policy to export American satellites for launch on China&#x27;s Long March rockets. Nelson called this an &quot;inconsistent administration policy.&quot; Nelson stated that Reagan &quot;wanted to build up commercial space ventures, and on the other hand, he is cutting off the commercial space ventures at the knees with these export licenses.&quot;

=== 1990 gubernatorial election ===
In 1990, Nelson ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for governor of Florida. His primary rival was former U.S. Senator Lawton Chiles. During the campaign, the younger Nelson tried to highlight Chiles&#x27; age and use of Prozac to treat his depression, but this proved to be an unpopular strategy, and Nelson lost by a wide margin, getting 30.5% of the vote to Chiles&#x27; 69.5%. Chiles went on to win the general election.

=== Treasurer, Insurance Commissioner and Fire Marshal ===

In 1994, Nelson announced his intention to seek the office of Treasurer, Insurance Commissioner, and Fire Marshal of Florida. He won the election with 52% of the vote over State Rep. Tim Ireland&#x27;s 48%. In 1998, he won re-election to the office, again defeating Ireland.

In 2000, Nelson announced that he would be running for the United States Senate seat held by retiring Republican Connie Mack III. Florida&#x27;s resign-to-run law compelled Nelson to submit his resignation as Treasurer, Insurance Commissioner and Fire Marshal early in 2000 when he began to campaign for the U.S. Senate seat. He chose January 3, 2001, as the effective date of his resignation, as that was the date on which new senators would be sworn in.

== United States Senate ==
=== Elections ===
==== 2000 ====

In 2000, Nelson ran as a Democrat for the U.S. Senate seat vacated by retiring Republican senator Connie Mack III. He won the election, defeating U.S. representative Bill McCollum, who ran as the Republican candidate.

==== 2006 ====

Following the 2004 election, in which Republican George W. Bush was re-elected and the Republican Party increased its majority in both the House and the Senate, Nelson was seen as vulnerable. He was a Democrat in a state that Bush had won, though by a margin of only five percentage points.

Evangelical Christian activist James Dobson declared that Democrats, including Nelson, would be &quot;in the &#x27;bull&#x27;s-eye&#x27;&quot; if they supported efforts to block Bush&#x27;s judicial nominees. Nelson&#x27;s refusal to support efforts in Congress to intervene in the Terri Schiavo case was seen as &quot;a great political issue&quot; for a Republican opponent to use in mobilizing Christian conservatives against him.

Katherine Harris, the former Florida secretary of state and two-term U.S. representative, defeated three other candidates in the September 5 Republican primary. Harris&#x27; role in the 2000 presidential election made her a polarizing figure. Many Florida Republicans were eager to reward her for her perceived party loyalty in the Bush-Gore election, while many Florida Democrats were eager to vote against her for the same reason. In May, when the party found itself unable to recruit a candidate who could defeat Harris in the primary, many Republican activists admitted that the race was already lost.

Nelson focused on safe issues, portraying himself as a bipartisan centrist problem-solver.
He obtained the endorsement of all 22 of Florida&#x27;s daily newspapers. Harris failed to secure the endorsement of Jeb Bush, who publicly stated that she could not win; the United States Chamber of Commerce, which had supported her in her House campaigns, did not endorse her in this race.

As the election approached, polls showed Harris trailing Nelson by 26 to 35 points. Nelson transferred about $16.5 million in campaign funds to other Democratic candidates, and won the election with 2,890,548 votes to Harris&#x27;s 1,826,127 votes. He won 57 out of the state&#x27;s 67 counties.

==== 2012 ====
Vice President Joe Biden called Nelson crucial to President Obama&#x27;s chances for winning Florida in 2012. In March 2011, Biden was reported as having said that if Nelson lost in 2012, &quot;it means President Obama and the Democratic presidential ticket won&#x27;t win the key battleground state, either.&quot; Congressman Connie Mack IV, the son of Nelson&#x27;s direct predecessor in the Senate, won the Republican nomination. Nelson eventually defeated Mack with 55.2% of the vote to Mack&#x27;s 42.2%.

==== 2018 ====
Nelson ran for reelection in 2018. He ran unopposed in the Democratic Party primary on August 28 and faced Florida Governor Rick Scott (a Republican) in the general election on November 6. The extremely tight race—with a margin of less than 0.25% separating Nelson and Scott—triggered a manual recount, per state law. The recount showed that Scott had defeated Nelson by 10,033 votes.

A paper by scholars at the MIT Election Data and Science Lab concluded that the design of Broward County&#x27;s 2018 general election ballots may have resulted in Nelson receiving 9,658 fewer votes than he otherwise would have, narrowing Scott&#x27;s margin of victory but not changing the result. The study found that many voters did not see the U.S. Senate race on the lower left side of the ballot and, as a result, did not vote in that race.

== Post-Senate activities ==
On May 28, 2019, Nelson was appointed to serve on NASA&#x27;s advisory council. Nelson was a member-at-large of the council, which advises on all major program and policy issues before the agency. NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine praised his appointment, saying, &quot;Nelson is a true champion for human spaceflight and will add tremendous value as we go to the Moon and on to Mars.&quot;

Nelson endorsed former vice president Joe Biden for President of the United States in 2020.

== NASA administrator ==
=== Nomination ===
On February 22, 2021, reports emerged that President Biden was considering nominating Nelson to be the Administrator of NASA. On March 18, it was reported that Biden had selected Nelson for the position; Biden officially announced the decision the next day. Nelson&#x27;s nomination received widespread support from members of Congress from both parties, including from Nelson&#x27;s Senate successor Rick Scott, as well as the overall space industry. On April 29, the Senate voted to confirm Nelson as NASA Administrator by unanimous consent. He was sworn in on May 3 by Vice President Kamala Harris.

=== Tenure ===
Biden chose former Space Shuttle commanders Pamela Melroy and Robert D. Cabana to assist Nelson as Deputy Administrator and Associate Administrator, respectively. After his retirement in 2023, Cabana was succeeded by exploration head Jim Free.

Despite opposing them in the past, Nelson became a steadfast supporter of commercial fixed-price contracts and allowing aerospace companies to bid for contracts, saying, &quot;with that competitive spirit, you get it done cheaper.&quot; He also affirmed his support for the Artemis program, and through former Senate colleagues was able to get the entire requested Artemis funding for 2022, the first time that had happened.

As NASA administrator, Nelson has overseen the deployment of the James Webb Space Telescope, the Artemis 1 mission, and the DART asteroid impact, as well as significant progress towards future Artemis launches.

== Political positions ==
Nelson was often considered a moderate Democrat. He styled himself as a centrist during his various campaigns. During his 2018 reelection campaign, challenger Rick Scott called Nelson a &quot;socialist&quot;; PolitiFact called the assertion &quot;pants-on-fire&quot; false. According to ratings by the &quot;National Journal&quot;, Nelson was given a 2013 composite score of 21% conservative and 80% liberal. In 2011, he was given composite scores of 37% conservative and 64% liberal.

Nelson has a lifetime conservative rating of nearly 30% from the American Conservative Union. Conversely, the Americans for Democratic Action gave Nelson a 90% liberal quotient for 2016. In the 115th Congress, Nelson was more conservative than 93% of other congressional Democrats. GovTrack, which analyzes a politician&#x27;s record, places him near the Senate&#x27;s ideological center and GovTrack placed him among the most moderate senators in 2017.

The only Florida Democrat in statewide office in 2017, Nelson was described by Politico in March of that year as &quot;a Senate indicator species ... an institutional centrist.&quot; Politico wrote that the Democratic Party &quot;is shifting left and so is he.&quot;

In July 2017, Nelson had a 53% approval rating and 25% disapproval rating, with 22% of survey respondents having no opinion on his job performance. FiveThirtyEight, which tracks congressional votes, shows that Nelson had voted with President Donald Trump&#x27;s positions 42.5% of the time .

=== Economic issues ===
;Trade
In 2005, Nelson was one of ten Democrats who voted in favor of the Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) on its 55–45 passage in the Senate.

;Tax policy
On several occasions, Nelson voted to reduce or eliminate the estate tax, notably in June 2006, when he was one of four Democrats voting for a failed (57–41) cloture motion on a bill to eliminate the tax.
Nelson voted against a Republican plan to extend the Bush tax cuts to all taxpayers. Instead, he supported extending the tax cuts for those with incomes below $250,000. Nelson voted for the Buffett Rule in April 2012. Of his support for the Buffett Rule, Nelson said he voted to raise the minimum tax rate on incomes over $1 million per year to 30% to reduce the budget deficit and to make the tax code fairer: &quot;In short, tax fairness for deficit reduction just makes common sense.&quot;

In 2011, Nelson voted to end Bush-era tax cuts for those earning over $250,000, but voted for $143 billion in tax cuts, unemployment benefits, and other economic measures.

In 2013, Nelson advocated tax reform, which he defined as &quot;getting rid of special interest tax breaks and corporate subsidies&quot; and gaining &quot;simplicity, fairness, and economic growth&quot;.

Nelson and Susan Collins introduced legislation in 2015 that would &quot;make it easier for smaller businesses to cut administrative costs by forming multiple-employer 401(k)-style plans.&quot;

;Government spending
Nelson voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, often referred to as economic stimulus, proposed by President Obama. In August 2011, he voted for a bill to increase the debt limit by $400 billion. Nelson said that while the bill was not perfect, &quot;this kind of gridlock doesn&#x27;t do anything.&quot; Nelson voted against Paul Ryan&#x27;s budget.

;Consumer affairs
In May 2013, Nelson asked the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to investigate why consumers who carried out a real-estate short sale were having their credit scores lowered to the same degree as those who went through foreclosure. Nelson suggested a penalty if the issue was not addressed within 90 days.

Nelson was interested in product safety issues and was often engaged in oversight and criticism of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. He repeatedly opposed Trump&#x27;s nominee to lead the commission.

;Flood insurance
Nelson voted in favor of the Biggert–Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012, which required the National Flood Insurance Program to raise insurance rates for some properties at high risk of flooding to better reflect true flood risk costs and keep the program solvent. In 2014, after an outcry by Florida property owners facing steep flood insurance-rate hikes, Nelson supported legislation that would provide retroactive refunds for taxpayers who had experienced large hikes in their flood-insurance rates due to the sale or purchase of a home. The proposal would also cap average annual premium increases at 15 to 18 percent and allow insurance-rates subsidies based on current flood maps.

;Earmarks
In 2010, PolitiFact found that Nelson had flip-flopped on the issue of earmarks, pushing for a moratorium on the practice after saying that &quot;earmarks were an important part of creating jobs and growing Florida&#x27;s economy.&quot;

=== Terrorism ===
In September 2014, Nelson said the U.S. should hit back at the Islamic State (ISIS) immediately, because &quot;the U.S. is the only one that can put together a coalition to stop this group that&#x27;s intent on barbaric cruelty.&quot;

He supported the &quot;Denying Firearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act.&quot; Introduced in 2013 and again in 2015, it would keep guns from people with suspected terrorist links.

Standing outside the Orlando Pulse nightclub immediately after the June 2016 massacre there, Nelson called Omar Mateen a &quot;lone wolf&quot;, and when asked if it was an act of jihad, said he could not confirm that. Shortly afterward, citing intelligence sources, Nelson said there was apparently &quot;a link to Islamic radicalism&quot; and perhaps ISIS. He later said on the Senate floor that &quot;terrorists ... want to divide people&quot;, but that Mateen had instead &quot;brought people together&quot;. After the massacre, Nelson and Barbara Mikulski supported an increase in FBI funding. A year after the massacre, Nelson attended a memorial at which he reiterated that it had &quot;united Orlando and it united the country&quot;.

Nelson supported the Terrorist Firearms Prevention Act of 2016.

In August 2017, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; urged Nelson to back Lindsey Graham&#x27;s Taylor Force Act, which would block U.S. subsidies to the Palestinian Authority, which gives monetary assistance to &quot;Palestinian prisoners, former prisoners and families of &#x27;martyrs.&#x27;&quot; Nelson did vote for the bill, which passed overwhelmingly.

=== Health care ===
In March 2010, Nelson voted for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which passed and were signed into law by President Obama.

In 2014, Nelson called for the expansion of Medicaid.

In 2016, Nelson called the House Zika bill &quot;a disaster&quot;, complaining that it would take &quot;$500 million in health care funding away from Puerto Rico&quot; and limit access to &quot;birth control services needed to help curb the spread of the virus and prevent terrible birth defects.&quot; In 2017, he wrote a letter to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) asking it to prioritize Zika prevention.

In September 2017, Nelson and Susan Collins introduced the Reinsurance Act of 2017, an effort &quot;to stabilize the health insurance marketplace&quot;. It would provide $2.25 billion to &quot;reduce risk for insurance companies by providing funds to insurers for high-risk enrollees&quot; and &quot;help keep premiums in check&quot;.

=== Immigration ===
In January 2017, Nelson wrote President Trump a letter protesting his immigration order. &quot;Regardless of the constitutionality or legality of this Executive Order,&quot; he wrote, &quot;I am deeply concerned that it may do more harm than good in our fight to keep America safe.&quot; U.S. success in the fight against terrorism, he argued, &quot;depends on the cooperation and assistance of Muslims who reject radicalism and violence. Whether intended or not, this Executive Order risks alienating the very people we rely upon in the fight against terror.&quot;

=== Space exploration and NASA ===
In March 2010, Nelson complained that President Obama had erred in canceling NASA&#x27;s Constellation program. He argued against the $6 billion development of the Commercial Crew Program proposed by the Obama administration and for a NASA-developed heavy lift rocket built on Constellation&#x27;s inheritance, which was later included in the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 and became SLS. 11 years later, Charles Bolden (NASA administrator in 2010) said that Nelson&#x27;s skepticism was common in Congress at the time and refused to call him an opponent of commercial crew.

On July 7, 2011, it was reported that Nelson said Congress &quot;starved&quot; the space program of funding for several years, but suggested that the situation was turning around and called on the Obama administration to push for NASA funding. In September 2011, Nelson and Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison led the push to continue the development of Constellation&#x27;s Ares V SLV in the form of Space Launch System.

In 2016, Nelson brokered a bipartisan compromise ending import of Russian RD-180 rocket engines.

In 2017 and 2018, Nelson sought to prevent Jim Bridenstine, Trump&#x27;s nominee to head NASA, from being confirmed in the Senate. Although Bridenstine had no formal qualifications in science or engineering, he refuted the &quot;scientific consensus&quot; on climate change. Bridenstine was ultimately confirmed.

During his own confirmation hearing in 2021, Nelson reversed his earlier stances on the Commercial Crew Program and desirability of a NASA administrator without STEM education, and praised Bridenstine (who had endorsed him earlier).

In June 2021, Nelson said of the future of U.S.-Russian cooperation in the International Space Station (ISS): &quot;For decades, upwards now of 45 plus years [we&#x27;ve cooperated with] Russians in space, and I want that cooperation to continue. Your politics can be hitting heads on Earth, while you are cooperating&quot; in space.

=== LGBT rights ===
On December 18, 2010, Nelson voted in favor of the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010, which established a legal process for ending the policy that prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the United States Armed Forces.

On April 4, 2013, Nelson announced that he no longer opposed same-sex marriage. He wrote, &quot;The civil rights and responsibilities for one must pertain to all. Thus, to discriminate against one class and not another is wrong for me. Simply put, if The Lord made homosexuals as well as heterosexuals, why should I discriminate against their civil marriage? I shouldn&#x27;t, and I won&#x27;t.&quot;

=== Foreign policy ===
==== Iraq War ====
Nelson voted for the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 authorizing military action against Iraq.

==== Iran ====
In July 2017, Nelson voted in favor of the Countering America&#x27;s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act that placed sanctions on Iran together with Russia and North Korea.

==== Israel ====
In September 2016, in advance of a UN Security Council resolution 2334 condemning Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories, Nelson signed an AIPAC-sponsored letter urging President Obama to veto &quot;one-sided&quot; resolutions against Israel.

In March 2017, Nelson co-sponsored the Israel Anti-Boycott Act, Senate Bill 720, which permits U.S. states to enact laws that would require contractors to sign a pledge saying that they will not boycott Israeli goods or their contracts will be terminated.

In December 2017, Nelson supported President Trump&#x27;s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital.

==== Venezuela ====
In April 2017, Nelson called for tougher economic sanctions against Venezuela, which he called an &quot;economic basket case&quot;.

==== Cuba ====
Nelson opposed a 2009 spending bill until his concerns about certain provisions in the bill related to Cuba were assuaged by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, who assured him that those provisions &quot;would not amount to a major reversal of the decades-old U.S. policy of isolating the communist-run island.&quot;

==== Syria visit ====
In 2006, on the bipartisan Iraq Study Group&#x27;s recommendation, Nelson met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in Damascus to try to improve US-Syria relations and help stabilize Iraq. He did this despite the United States Department of State and the White House saying they disapproved of the trip.

==== Russia ====
Following the destruction of Kosmos 1408 in an anti-satellite weapons test by Russia, Nelson said, &quot;With its long and storied history in human spaceflight, it is unthinkable that Russia would endanger not only the American and international partner astronauts on the ISS, but also their own cosmonauts&quot;, and the &quot;actions are reckless and dangerous, threatening as well the Chinese space station&quot;.

=== Gun control ===
In 2012, the National Rifle Association (NRA) gave Nelson an &quot;F&quot; rating for his support of gun control. He advocated new gun control laws, including an assault weapons ban, a ban on magazines over ten rounds, and a proposal that would require universal background checks for people buying guns at gun shows.

In response to the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, Nelson expressed remorse that the Feinstein Amendment, which would have banned the sale of guns to people on the terrorist watch list, and a Republican proposal to update background checks and to create an alert for law enforcement when a person is placed on the terrorist watch list, had failed to pass the Senate. He said: &quot;What am I going to tell the community of Orlando that is trying to come together in the healing? Sadly, what I am going to have to tell them is that the NRA won again.&quot; Both he and Marco Rubio supported the bills.

In October 2017, after the Las Vegas shooting, Nelson and Dianne Feinstein sponsored a bill to ban bump stocks for assault weapons. &quot;I&#x27;m a hunter and have owned guns my whole life&quot;, he said. &quot;But these automatic weapons are not for hunting, they are for killing.&quot;

Nelson spread misinformation via Twitter after the Parkland high school shooting in 2018, falsely claiming that shooter Nikolas Cruz wore a gas mask and tossed smoke grenades as he shot people. After an April 2018 shooting in Liberty City, Nelson claimed that assault weapons had been used in the shooting, when in fact handguns were used.

=== Student loans ===
In July 2017, Nelson introduced legislation to cut interest rates on student loans to 4 percent.

=== Environment ===
Nelson and Mel Martinez co-sponsored a 2006 bill banning oil drilling off Florida&#x27;s Gulf Coast. In 2017 he said he wanted the ban to continue to 2027, but that it was &quot;vigorously opposed by the oil industry.&quot; Along with 16 Florida congress members from both parties, he urged the Trump administration to keep the eastern Gulf of Mexico off limits to oil and gas drilling. &quot;Drilling in this area,&quot; they wrote, &quot;threatens Florida&#x27;s multibillion-dollar tourism-driven economy and is incompatible with the military training and weapons testing that occurs there.&quot;

In 2011, Nelson co-sponsored the RESTORE Act, which directed money from BP fines to states affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

On June 27, 2013, Nelson co-sponsored what became the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Amendments Act of 2014, which reauthorized and modified the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act of 1998 and authorized the appropriation of $20.5 million annually through 2018 for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to mitigate the harmful effects of algal blooms and hypoxia.

In 2015, after Gov. Rick Scott directed Florida officials to stop using the terms &quot;climate change&quot; and &quot;global warming,&quot; Nelson introduced an amendment to prevent federal agencies from censoring official communications on climate change. It &quot;fell to a point of order after a 51-49 vote, though Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) joined Nelson in supporting the amendment.&quot;

=== Hurricanes ===
After Hurricane Maria in 2017, Nelson and Rubio agreed that Trump had taken too long to send the U.S. military to Puerto Rico to take part in relief efforts. &quot;For one week we were slow at the switch,&quot; Nelson said in San Juan. &quot;The most efficient organization in a time of disaster is an organization that is already capable of long supply lines in combat. And that&#x27;s the U.S. military.&quot; After Hurricane Maria led many Puerto Ricans to flee to Florida, Nelson encouraged them to register to vote there.

Nelson was criticized for sending campaign fundraising emails in the wake of Hurricane Irma.

=== Supreme Court ===
Nelson opposed and filibustered the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court.

=== Security and surveillance ===
In 2007, Nelson was the only Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee to vote against an amendment to withhold funds for the use by the CIA of torture on terrorism suspects. His vote, combined with those of all Republican members of the committee, killed the measure.

In January 2018, Nelson voted to reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows the National Security Agency to extend a program of warrantless spying on internet and phone networks. In 2015, he had called for a permanent extension of the law.

== Controversies ==
=== The far side of the Moon ===
During a congressional hearing, when queried about China’s lunar ambitions targeting the moon&#x27;s far side, Nelson mistakenly said, &quot;They are going to have a lander on the far side of the moon, which is the side that is always in dark&quot; (the far side does receive sunlight). The incident fueled debate amid a burgeoning space race narrative, with China’s comprehensive lunar initiatives, including the Chang&#x27;e missions, and the Artemis program, both vying to send astronauts back to the moon.

=== Campaign donations from Saudi Arabia ===
Nelson received campaign contributions from Saudi Arabia&#x27;s lobbyists. In June 2017, he voted to support Trump&#x27;s $110 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia. In March 2018, Nelson voted against Bernie Sanders&#x27;s and Chris Murphy&#x27;s bill to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led intervention in the Yemeni civil war.

=== Russian hack claim ===
On August 7, 2018, Nelson claimed that Russian operatives had penetrated some of Florida&#x27;s election systems ahead of the 2018 midterm elections; the claim was contentious during his 2018 reelection bid. He said that more detailed information was classified. At the time, fact-checkers did not have evidence to backup Nelson&#x27;s claims, but later that August, &quot;three people familiar with the intelligence&quot; told NBC News &quot;that there is a classified basis for Nelson&#x27;s assertion&quot; because &quot;VR Systems had been penetrated in August 2016 by hackers working for&quot; GRU.

A government official familiar with the intelligence told The McClatchy Company that Russian hackers had penetrated some of Florida&#x27;s county voting systems in 2016. DHS spokesperson Sarah Sendek said that the agency has &quot;not seen any new compromises by Russian actors of election infrastructure.&quot; &quot;The Tampa Bay Times&quot; reported that leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee had told Nelson of a penetration of some of Florida&#x27;s voter registration databases in 2016.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and FBI director Christopher Wray denied Nelson&#x27;s claims in a letter to Florida election officials. Amid the criticism, Nelson defended his assertions, saying that Senate Intelligence Committee leaders Mark Warner and Richard Burr had instructed him and fellow Florida Senator Marco Rubio to warn the Florida secretary of state about Russian interference. Warner and Burr neither confirmed nor denied Nelson&#x27;s claim that Florida&#x27;s systems had been penetrated, while Rubio took &quot;a line on the controversy similar to Burr and Warner&#x27;s&quot;. The Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a conservative watchdog group, filed an ethics complaint against Nelson, saying that he &quot;discussed classified information or made it up&quot;.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller&#x27;s investigation on Russian interference in the 2016 election, which concluded in 2019, found that Russian intelligence officials &quot;sent spearphishing emails to over 120 email accounts used by Florida county officials responsible for administering the 2016 U.S. election&quot; and that &quot;at least one Florida county&quot; was successfully penetrated. In August 2018, federal authorities said they saw no signs of any &quot;new or ongoing compromises&quot; of state or local election systems. In May 2019, Governor Ron DeSantis said that voter databases in two counties had been successfully penetrated ahead of the 2016 presidential election.

== Personal life ==
In 1972, Nelson married Grace Cavert. The couple has two adult children, Charles William &quot;Bill Jr.&quot; Nelson and Nan Ellen Nelson.

<doc id="363274" wikidata="Q718542" url="?curid=363274" title="Ben Nelson">
<text>Earl Benjamin Nelson (born May 17, 1941) is an American attorney, businessman, and politician who served as the 37th governor of Nebraska from 1991 to 1999 and as a United States Senator from Nebraska from 2001 to 2013. He is a member of the Democratic Party, and as of 2025, is the last Democrat to hold and/or win any statewide elected office in Nebraska.

Nelson was an insurance executive before he entered politics. His first run for office was in 1990, when he narrowly defeated incumbent Republican governor Kay Orr. He was reelected by a landslide in 1994. He ran for an open U.S. Senate seat in 1996, losing in an upset to Republican Chuck Hagel. He was elected to Nebraska&#x27;s other Senate seat in 2000, and reelected in 2006. He did not run for a third term in 2012, and was succeeded by Republican Deb Fischer.

Nelson was the most conservative Democrat during his time in the Senate, frequently voting against his party.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Earl Benjamin Nelson was born on May 17, 1941, in McCook, in southwestern Nebraska. He is the only child of Birdella and Benjamin Earl Nelson. He is an Eagle Scout.

He earned a B.A. in 1963, an M.A. in 1965, and a J.D. in 1970—all from the University of Nebraska.

After graduating from law school, Nelson landed a job as assistant general counsel for Central National Insurance Group of Omaha. After several years in the business, in 1975 the governor appointed him state insurance director. After the administration changed, he returned to work for Central National Insurance as an executive vice president and eventually president.

==Political career==
Nelson became involved in state politics, joining the Democratic Party. In 1986, he served as state chairman of Democrat Helen Boosalis&#x27;s gubernatorial campaign. She was mayor of Lincoln, Nebraska. Boosalis was defeated by state treasurer Republican Kay Orr, 53% to 47%.

===Governor of Nebraska===
Nelson first ran for electoral office in the 1990 Nebraska gubernatorial election, defeating first-term Republican incumbent Orr by 4,030 votes out of over 586,000 cast. He was reelected in 1994 with 73% of the vote, the largest margin of victory for a governor in half a century, despite the national Republican gains that year.

During his tenure, Nelson cut spending from the previous administration by 64%, when it was forecast to rise by 13%. He introduced legislation to cut crime through the Safe Streets Act and Juvenile Crime Bill, advocated for low-income families through the Kids Connection health care system, and enacted welfare reforms. He also cut taxes for over 400,000 middle-income families.

As governor, Nelson took some conservative stances on issues in right-leaning Nebraska. He pushed welfare reform before it was done at a national level and opposed President Bill Clinton&#x27;s efforts on health care.

During the 1990 campaign, Nelson attacked Orr&#x27;s support for a proposed low-level nuclear waste dump in the state. During his tenure, the Nebraska State Department of Environmental Quality denied the dump&#x27;s application for an operating license, prompting a lawsuit that Nebraska settled for $145 million.

Nelson ran for a seat in the U.S. Senate in 1996 when fellow Democrat Jim Exon retired. He was defeated by Republican businessman and Vietnam veteran Chuck Hagel in an upset.

In 1998, Nelson was ineligible to run for reelection because of Nebraska&#x27;s term-limits law. He was succeeded as governor by Mike Johanns, the Republican mayor of Lincoln. As of 2025, Nelson is the last Democrat to serve as governor of Nebraska.

===U.S. Senator===
====2000 election====
Nelson was nominated by the Democrats for the Senate in the 2000 election after his fellow Democrat, incumbent Bob Kerrey, announced his retirement. His opponent was Attorney General Don Stenberg. Nelson won the election with 51% of the vote after a campaign in which he spent 50% more ($1,004,985) than Stenberg. Despite initially pledging to work together, Nelson and now fellow U.S. senator from Nebraska Hagel had a somewhat frosty relationship.

====2006 election====
Nelson was thought to be in danger of losing his seat in 2006, as it was thought his successor as governor, Mike Johanns, was almost certain to run against him; that speculation ended when Johanns was appointed U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. With Johanns&#x27;s move to Washington, few high-profile Republicans stepped up to run against Nelson, as the state party focused its attention on the governor&#x27;s race. The Republican nomination was won by Pete Ricketts, a former TD Ameritrade executive.

In the general election, Nelson was endorsed by the National Rifle Association of America, Nebraska Right to Life (National Right to Life&#x27;s state affiliate), Nebraskans United for Life, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, Nebraska Farmers Union PAC, National Farmers Union PAC, the Veterans of Foreign Wars PAC, the Business-Industry Political Action Committee, and the Omaha Police Union, all conservative-leaning groups.

Nelson defeated Ricketts 64%-36%, the biggest victory margin for a Democratic Senate candidate in Nebraska since Edward Zorinsky won 66% of the vote in 1982. In doing so, he received the votes of 42% of Republicans and 73% of Independents on top of 96% of those from his own party. He also won all but 13 counties in the western part of the state, a surprising feat in normally heavily Republican Nebraska.
==Political positions==
===Abortion===
Nelson is anti-abortion. In the 2006 election, he was endorsed by Nebraska Right to Life and Nebraskans United for Life. He lost Nebraska Right to Life&#x27;s support after voting for the Senate version of health-care legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which did not contain the Stupak language.

===Earmarks===
In July 2007, Senator Tom Coburn criticized earmarks that Nelson had inserted into the 2007 defense spending bill, alleging that they would benefit Nelson&#x27;s son Patrick&#x27;s employer with millions in federal dollars, and that the situation violated terms of the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, which the Senate passed but had not yet been voted on in the House. Nelson&#x27;s spokesperson said he did nothing wrong and was acting with &quot;an abundance of caution&quot; when he withdrew the amendment after the new Senate Ethics Rules were passed. Some government watchdogs, including Public Citizen, commented that the earmark probably didn&#x27;t violate ethics rules. More than one publication questioned Coburn&#x27;s motives, as his criticism did not include his own state delegation&#x27;s earmark requests.

===Health care and &quot;Cornhusker Kickback&quot;===
In late 2009, the Senate&#x27;s 40 Republicans unanimously opposed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Senate&#x27;s version of health-care legislation. To end a Republican filibuster and pass the measure, the Democrats needed the votes of all 58 of their senators, plus those of two independents who caucused with their party. Nelson was the 60th and last senator to vote for cloture.

According to Nelson, he wanted to ensure that the final version of the law prohibited the use of public funds for abortions. His cloture vote came after the measure was amended to permit states to opt out of allowing insurance exchange plans to provide abortion coverage. People with plans that covered abortion costs would pay for that coverage separately from their payment for the rest of the plan. The bill also provided full and permanent federal reimbursement for the expenses Nebraska would incur in its mandated expansion of Medicaid eligibility, an amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated at $100 million.

The health-care measure was controversial, and Nelson&#x27;s vote provoked a strong response. Opponents of the Medicaid reimbursement scheme derided it as the &quot;Cornhusker Kickback&quot;. Among those denouncing the provision was Dave Heineman, Nebraska&#x27;s Republican governor. To these criticisms, Nelson responded that he had been attempting to eliminate an unfunded federal mandate upon the states, and that the Nebraska item was a &quot;placeholder&quot;, intended from the start to be replaced by a revision that would provide reimbursement for the increased Medicaid costs of every state.

Anti-abortion organizations also responded negatively to Nelson&#x27;s vote. In April 2010, Nebraska Right to Life declared that it would never again endorse Nelson.

Nelson&#x27;s popularity fell among Nebraskans in the wake of his cloture vote. According to Omaha.com, &quot;Almost overnight, the controversial vote knocked [Nelson&#x27;s] Nebraska voter approval rating from 78 percent, the highest in the Senate, to 42 percent, according to one poll, and prompted relentless criticism, with many observers saying his political career was over.&quot; A December 2009 Rasmussen poll indicated that in a hypothetical Nelson–Heineman race, the Republican would get 61% of the vote to Nelson&#x27;s 30%. In the same poll, 64% of the Nebraska voters surveyed opposed the health-care bill.

With the victory of Republican Scott Brown in the special election to fill the Senate seat vacated by the death of Senator Edward Kennedy, Democrats lost their filibuster-proof majority. Since Brown had declared himself opposed to the health-care measure, the party&#x27;s leadership opted to enact the legislation through the budget reconciliation process. Nelson voted against the final version of the legislation, the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. His support for the measure was no longer essential to its passage, since the reconciliation bill was not subject to filibuster and required only a simple majority.

The measure as ultimately passed eliminated the special Medicaid reimbursement for Nebraska, as Nelson had requested in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid about a month after his crucial cloture vote. Nelson said his opposition to the final measure arose from newly added provisions related to student loans that would adversely affect Nebraska-based student-lending firm Nelnet. Despite voting against it, he subsequently defended the law, saying, &quot;I am willing to fight to improve it, but not to repeal it.&quot;

===Iraq===
On March 15, 2007, Nelson was one of two Democratic senators to vote against invoking cloture on a resolution aimed at withdrawing most American combat troops from Iraq in 2008. The vote, requiring 60 votes to pass, was 50 to 48 against.

As a result of traveling to Iraq four times, the last in September 2007, Nelson took the position that a transition of the mission in Iraq was necessary, as opposed to full withdrawal of troops. The Jones Commission supported his view on September 6, 2007, when General James L. Jones presented a report to Congress claiming that &quot;The circumstances of the moment may continue to present the opportunity for considering a shift in the disposition and employment of our forces... such a strategy would include placing increasing responsibilities for the internal security of the nation on the ISF, especially in urban areas. Coalition forces could be re-tasked to better ensure the territorial defense of the state by increasingly concentrating on the eastern and western borders and the active defense of the critical infrastructures essential to Iraq.&quot; The premise that stability in Iraq would only be achieved through political reconciliation acted on through legislation, a view long held by Nelson, was also recommended by Jones, reporting, &quot;The future of Iraq… hinges on the ability of the Iraqi people and the government to begin the process of achieving national reconciliation and to ending sectarian violence.&quot;

In the spring of 2007, Senators Nelson, Susan Collins of Maine, and John Warner of Virginia authored a list of measures, or &quot;benchmarks&quot;, that were included in the Iraq Supplemental bill. These benchmarks allowed for progress to be measured in certain areas such as recognition of minority groups, strengthening of internal security forces, and equal distribution of oil revenue. President George W. Bush and General David Petraeus were required to report on the advancement of these &quot;benchmarks&quot;.

Nelson and Collins also introduced legislation on July 11, 2007, that would transition U.S. troops out of Baghdad. The legislation called for turning over internal security efforts to Iraqi forces after which the U.S. military would secure the borders, protect the infrastructure, and continue to search for al-Qaeda forces.

===Judicial appointments===
Nelson was the lead Democratic senator among the &quot;Gang of 14,&quot; a bloc of 14 senators who, on May 23, 2005, forged a compromise on the Democrats&#x27; use of the judicial filibuster, thus blocking the Republican leadership&#x27;s attempt to implement the so-called &quot;nuclear option&quot;. Under the gang&#x27;s agreement, Democrats would retain the power to filibuster one of Bush&#x27;s judicial nominees only in an &quot;extraordinary circumstance&quot;, and the three most conservative Bush appellate court nominees (Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen and William Pryor) would receive a vote by the full Senate. Nelson was the only Democrat to vote to confirm Brown; he was later the first Democratic senator to support Samuel Alito&#x27;s confirmation to the Supreme Court of the United States. Nelson also voted twice, with three other Democrats, to end Senate debate over Bush&#x27;s United Nations Ambassador nominee John Bolton.

In an op-ed column, Nelson wrote: &quot;The president&#x27;s nominees, especially to the Supreme Court, deserve an up-or-down vote, even if the nominee isn&#x27;t popular with the special-interest groups in Washington.&quot;

In 2010, when Barack Obama nominated Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court, Nelson was the only Democrat to vote against her confirmation, saying &quot;I have heard concerns from Nebraskans regarding Ms. Kagan, and her lack of a judicial record makes it difficult for me to discount the concerns raised by Nebraskans, or to reach a level of comfort that these concerns are unfounded. Therefore, I will not vote to confirm Ms. Kagan&#x27;s nomination&quot;

===Same-sex marriage===
In 1996, Nelson proposed and supported legislation to prevent Nebraska from recognizing same-sex marriages formed in other states. This was his response to a court case in Hawaii that Nelson feared would legalize gay marriage.

Nelson supported Initiative 416, an amendment to the Nebraska constitution prohibiting same-sex marriage and domestic partnership.

===Taxes===
Nelson was one of five Democratic senators to vote for the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. The measure called for $1.35 trillion in tax cuts over 11 years and nearly $2 trillion in spending for the next fiscal year. The spending was close to that proposed by Bush; the tax cuts were slightly less than the $1.6 trillion Bush sought. Nelson also voted for passage of the 2003 tax cut which accelerated many of the provisions in the 2001 tax cut in addition to benefits for small businesses.

In October 2009, Americans for Tax Reform stated that Nelson was the only Democratic senator who had signed its Taxpayer Protection Pledge, and launched an advocacy campaign to urge him to oppose the health care reform proposals in Congress, which, they asserted, contained &quot;billions of dollars in income tax hikes.&quot;

In July 2012, Nelson, with 18 other senators, cosponsored a bill that would allow states to collect sales taxes on interstate sales, including catalogue and Internet sales. The bill (Marketplace Fairness Act, S.1832) would require any seller who sold a product or service to a consumer from another state to calculate, collect and pay to that other state the sales tax based on that state&#x27;s tax rates. Proponents argued that the measure would redress an unfair economic advantage enjoyed by online sellers over local businesses arising from the fact that the former were often not required to collect sales taxes from their customers. Opponents maintained that it would be unfair to require interstate merchants to collect sales taxes in jurisdictions where they had no physical presence, and thus derived no benefit from the taxes; and that the variety and complexity of state and local sales taxes would place a burden on merchants required to keep track of them in order to collect the taxes.

===Other votes===
Nelson&#x27;s votes in the Senate often placed him at odds with the leadership of his party. A &quot;National Journal&quot; congressional vote rating from 2006 placed him to the right of five Senate Republicans (Gordon Smith, Olympia Snowe, Arlen Specter, Susan Collins, and Lincoln Chafee). Mary Landrieu was the only other Democrat to the right of any Republicans (she placed to the right of Chafee). A similar 2007 &quot;National Journal&quot; rating went even further, placing Nelson to the right of eight Senate Republicans (the above five as well as Richard Lugar, Norm Coleman, and Mike DeWine), with Landrieu once again to Chafee&#x27;s right and the only other Democrat to the right of any Republicans. For 2012, the American Conservative Union rated his overall performance at 48 percent, the highest of any Democratic senator.

Nelson was one of only two Democratic senators to vote against the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. He voted with Republicans on bankruptcy reform, environmental protection, class action lawsuits, and trade. In 2004 he was one of only three Democratic senators to vote to invoke cloture on the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment; in 2006 he was one of only two Democratic senators to vote that way. He was the only Democratic senator to vote against a 2006 bill that would have extended federal funding for stem cell research. But he consistently voted against drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He also opposed Bush&#x27;s plan to send 21,500 more troops to Iraq. Early in Bush&#x27;s first term he voted with the majority of his party against scrapping President Bill Clinton&#x27;s expansive new rules on ergonomics regulation for workers; many of his fellow conservative Democrats like John Breaux, Max Baucus, Blanche Lincoln, and Zell Miller voted with Republicans on the issue. On April 26, 2010, Nelson was one of two Democratic senators in attendance to vote against the motion to move a financial regulations bill forward, siding with Senate Republicans. The other was Harry Reid, who voted against his own proposed bill for procedural reasons.

On December 18, 2010, Nelson voted with Democrats for the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010.

==Post-Senate career==
In January 2013, Nelson was named chief executive officer of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, an organization of state insurance regulatory agencies for the United States and several of its territories. The body establishes standards and coordinates regulatory oversight for the state agencies. He left the association and returned to his private law practice in January 2016.

<doc id="363276" wikidata="Q381670" url="?curid=363276" title="Chuck Hagel">
<text>Charles Timothy Hagel ( ; born October 4, 1946) is an American politician and Army veteran who served as the 24th United States secretary of defense from 2013 to 2015 in the administration of Barack Obama. He previously served as chairman of the president&#x27;s Intelligence Advisory Board from 2009 to 2013 and as a United States senator representing Nebraska from 1997 to 2009.

A recipient of two Purple Hearts while an infantry squad leader in the Vietnam War, Hagel returned home to start careers in business and politics. He co-founded Vanguard Cellular, the primary source of his personal wealth, and served as president of the McCarthy Group, an investment banking firm, and CEO of American Information Systems Inc., a computerized voting machine manufacturer. A member of the Republican Party, Hagel was first elected to the United States Senate in 1996. He was reelected in 2002, but did not run in 2008.

On January 7, 2013, President Barack Obama nominated Hagel to serve as Secretary of Defense. On February 12, 2013, the Senate Armed Services Committee approved Hagel&#x27;s nomination by a vote of 14–11. On February 14, 2013, Senate Republicans did not vote with Democrats so there were not 60 votes needed to end the debate on Hagel&#x27;s nomination and proceed to a final vote, citing the need for further review. It was the first time that a nominee for Secretary of Defense was filibustered, although candidates for other cabinet offices had been filibustered before. On February 26, 2013, the Senate voted for cloture on Hagel&#x27;s nomination and confirmed him by a vote of 58–41. He took office on February 27, 2013, as his predecessor, Leon Panetta, stepped down.

Hagel previously served as a professor at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University, chairman of the Atlantic Council, and co-chairman of the President&#x27;s Intelligence Advisory Board. Before his appointment as Secretary of Defense, Hagel served on a number of boards of directors, including that of Chevron Corporation.

On November 24, 2014, it was announced that Hagel would resign following conflicts within the administration, particularly relating to issues concerning ISIL.

==Early life, education, military, and early political career==
Hagel was born in North Platte, Nebraska, a son of Charles Dean Hagel, and his wife Elizabeth (Betty) Dunn. His father was of German heritage, while his mother was of Irish and Polish ancestry. Growing up, Hagel lived across Nebraska; in Ainsworth, Rushville, Scottsbluff, Terrytown, York and Columbus. Hagel was the oldest of four brothers. His father, a veteran of World War II, died suddenly on Christmas morning, 1962, at the age of 39, when Hagel was 16. He graduated from St. Bonaventure High School (now Scotus Central Catholic High School) in Columbus, Nebraska, in 1964, attended Brown Institute for radio and TV through 1966, and earned a BGS degree with a concentration in history from the University of Nebraska at Omaha in 1971.

Hagel volunteered to be drafted into the United States Army during the Vietnam War, rejecting a draft board recommendation that he go to college instead. He served in the United States Army infantry in Vietnam from 1967 to 1968. As a sergeant (E-5), he served as an infantry squad leader in the 9th Infantry Division. Hagel served in the same infantry squad as his younger brother Tom, and they are thought to be the only American brothers to have done so during the Vietnam War. They also saved each other&#x27;s lives on separate occasions. Hagel received the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, two Purple Hearts, the Army Commendation Medal, and the Combat Infantryman Badge.

After his discharge, he worked as a radio newscaster and talk show host in Omaha from 1969 to 1971 while finishing college on Veterans Administration (VA) assistance under the GI Bill.

In 1971, Hagel was hired as a staffer for Congressman John Y. McCollister (R-NE), serving until 1977. For the next four years, he worked as a lobbyist for Firestone Tire and Rubber Company, and in 1980, he served as an organizer for the successful presidential campaign of former California Governor Ronald Reagan.

After Reagan&#x27;s inauguration as president, Hagel was named deputy administrator of the Veterans Administration. In 1982, however, he resigned over a disagreement with VA Administrator Robert P. Nimmo, who was intent on cutting funding for VA programs. Nimmo had referred to veterans groups as &quot;greedy&quot;, and to Agent Orange as not much worse than a &quot;little teenage acne.&quot;

==Business career (1982–1996)==
After leaving government employment, Hagel co-founded Vanguard Cellular, a mobile phone service carrier that made him a multi-millionaire. While working with Vanguard, he served as president and chief executive officer of the United Service Organizations and the Private Sector Council, as deputy director and chief operating officer of the 1990 G7 Summit, and on the board of directors or advisory committee of the American Red Cross, the Eisenhower World Affairs Institute, Bread for the World, and the Ripon Society. He also served as Chairman of the Agent Orange Settlement Fund and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.

Although he was pressured by some to run for Governor of Virginia, where he had lived for 20 years, in 1992 Hagel moved back to Nebraska to become president of the McCarthy Group, LLC, an investment banking firm. He also served as a chairman and was CEO of American Information Systems Inc. (AIS), later known as Election Systems &amp; Software, a computerized voting machine manufacturer jointly owned by McCarthy Group, LLC and the Omaha World-Herald company. On March 15, 1995, Hagel resigned from the board of AIS as he intended to run for office. Michael McCarthy, the parent company&#x27;s founder, was Hagel&#x27;s campaign treasurer. Until at least 2003, he retained between $1 million and $5 million in stock in Election Systems &amp; Software&#x27;s parent company, the McCarthy Group.

==U.S. Senate (1997–2009)==

===Elections===

In 1996, Hagel ran for the open US Senate seat created by the retirement of Democrat J. James Exon. Hagel&#x27;s opponent was Ben Nelson, then the sitting governor of Nebraska. Hagel won and became the first Republican in 24 years to win a Senate seat in Nebraska. Six years later, in 2002, Hagel overwhelmingly won re-election with over 83% of the vote, the largest margin of victory in any statewide race in Nebraska history.

===Senate voting record===

According to David Boaz, of the Cato Institute, during the Bush administration, Hagel maintained a &quot;traditionally Republican&quot; voting record, receiving &quot;a lifetime rating of 84 percent from the American Conservative Union and consistent A and B grades from the National Taxpayers Union.&quot; On the Issues describes Hagel as a &quot;libertarian-leaning conservative.&quot; According to Boaz, among his most notable votes, Hagel:
* Voted for the Patriot Act;
* Voted for the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts;
* Voted against No Child Left Behind;
* Voted against the Medicare prescription drug bill;
* Voted against McCain-Feingold.
====Foreign policy====
Hagel co-sponsored the failed Kosovo Resolution, authorizing the use of U.S. military force against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Hagel voted in favor of Senate Joint Resolution 23, authorizing &quot;necessary and appropriate U.S. Military force&quot; in Afghanistan against those who planned or aided the September 11 attacks. During his tenure in the Senate, Hagel continued his support for NATO involvement, and funding in the War in Afghanistan. In a 2009 &quot;The Washington Post&quot; op-ed after being nominated as Chairman of President Obama&#x27;s Intelligence advisory board, Hagel said that &quot;We cannot view U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan through a lens that sees only &#x27;winning&#x27; or &#x27;losing,&#x27; Iraq and Afghanistan are not America&#x27;s to win or lose.&quot; And that &quot;We can help them buy time or develop, but we cannot control their fates.&quot; In 2011, after he left office, Hagel stated that President Obama needs to start &quot;looking for the exit in Afghanistan&quot;, and that &quot;We need to start winding this down.&quot;

On October 11, 2002, Hagel, along with 76 other senators, voted in favor of the Iraq Resolution. Hagel, a later critic of the war, commented on his vote authorizing the use of force against Iraq saying,

How many of us really know and understand much about Iraq, the country, the history, the people, the role in the Arab world? I approach the issue of post-Saddam Iraq and the future of democracy and stability in the Middle East with more caution, realism, and a bit more humility.

In July 2007, Hagel was one of three Republican senators who supported Democratic-proposed legislation requiring a troop withdrawal from Iraq to begin within 120 days. He told Robert D. Novak &quot;This thing is really coming undone quickly, and [Prime Minister] Maliki&#x27;s government is weaker by the day. The police are corrupt, top to bottom. The oil problem is a huge problem. They still can&#x27;t get anything through the parliament—no hydrocarbon law, no de-Baathification law, no provincial elections.&quot; In 2008, along with then-Senator (and presumptive Democratic nominee for president) Barack Obama, and Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), Hagel visited Iraq in a congressional delegation trip, meeting with U.S. service members, General David Petraeus, and the Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki. While talking to reporters in Iraq, Hagel said, &quot;Each one of us who has a responsibility of helping lead this country needs to reflect on what we think is in the interests of our country, not the interest of our party or our president.&quot;

====National security====
In his first term in the Senate, Hagel voted in favor of the Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat Reduction Act, establishing criminal penalties for possession of Chemical or Biological weapons, and he cosponsored the American Missile Protection Act, deploying an effective National Missile Defense system capable of defending the U.S. against limited ballistic missile attacks. Hagel voted to establish the United States Department of Homeland Security, and supported increasing Defense Department spending, voting in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act every year he served in the Senate. Hagel voted for spending increases in preventing HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria funding, and voting against caps on the U.S.&#x27;s foreign aid budget.

====Veterans affairs====
In 2007, Hagel introduced Senate Amendment 2032, amending the Defense Authorization bill limiting the deployment of U.S. service members serving in Iraq to 12 months. The amendment needed 60 votes in the Senate to pass, and was ultimately defeated in a 52–45 vote. In 2008, Hagel was a principal co-sponsor with two other veterans in the Senate of Senator Jim Webb&#x27;s &quot;21st Century GI Bill&quot; which passed Congress as the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, expanding education assistance to veterans who served after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. During his tenure in the Senate, Hagel supported the military&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; policy, barring openly LGBT members of the armed forces from serving, but was later described as &quot;pro-ending don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell.&quot;

====Civil liberties====
In 2001, Hagel voted in favor of the Patriot Act. Although Hagel originally indicated a &quot;nay&quot; vote in reauthorizing expiring provisions of the Patriot Act in 2006, Hagel voted in favor of reauthorization. After calls from the Bush administration for the House and Senate to reform FISA, the House introduced the Protect America Act of 2007, expanding provisions allowing electronic surveillance of foreigners outside of the U.S. with a warrant. In a 68–29 vote, the Protect America Act of 2007 passed the Senate, with Hagel voting to expand FISA&#x27;s provisions on warrantless surveillance.

Hagel voted in favor of Senate Amendment 2022, restoring &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, the right to due process, to American citizens detained at Guantanamo Bay detention camp, but voted against a similar resolution restoring it to all prisoners detained at Guantanamo. In response to the Bush administration&#x27;s intentions to keep Guantanamo Bay open permanently, Hagel said the military prison is why the U.S. is &quot;losing the image war around the world,&quot; and that &quot;It&#x27;s identifiable with, for right or wrong, a part of America that people in the world believe is a power, an empire that pushes people around, we do it our way, we don&#x27;t live up to our commitments to multilateral institutions.&quot;

====Immigration====
Hagel co-sponsored the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006. He supported the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 and, with Senator Bob Menendez proposed an amendment to allow immigration authorities to consider family-unification petitions submitted by people for an additional two years, which would have allowed approximately estimated 833,000 additional individuals to seek permanent residency. The proposal received 51 votes but was defeated by a procedural maneuver. The bill failed to pass. Hagel voted in favor of the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which aimed to build a double fence along the Mexico–United States border and appropriated $1.2 billion for the fence and a systematic surveillance system.

===Criticism of Bush administration===
On August 18, 2005, Hagel compared the Iraq War to Vietnam, and openly mocked Vice President Dick Cheney&#x27;s assertion that the Iraqi insurgency was in its &quot;last throes.&quot; In November 2005, Hagel defended his criticism of the Iraq war, stating &quot;To question your government is not unpatriotic — to not question your government is unpatriotic.&quot; In December 2005, in reference to Bush, the Republican Party, and the Patriot Act, Hagel stated &quot;I took an oath of office to the Constitution, I didn&#x27;t take an oath of office to my party or my president.&quot;
In January 2006, Hagel took issue with Karl Rove&#x27;s statement that the Republican and Democratic worldviews were &quot;post-9/11&quot; and &quot;pre-9/11&quot;, respectively. Hagel stated, &quot;I didn&#x27;t like what Mr. Rove said, because it frames terrorism and the issue of terrorism and everything that goes with it, whether it&#x27;s the renewal of the Patriot Act or the NSA wiretapping, in a political context.&quot;

In July 2006, Hagel criticized the Bush administration on its handling of the 2006 Lebanon War, saying &quot;The sickening slaughter on both sides must end and it must end now. President Bush must call for an immediate cease-fire. This madness must stop.&quot; He also said &quot;Our relationship with Israel is special and historic... But it need not and cannot be at the expense of our Arab and Muslim relationships. That is an irresponsible and dangerous false choice.&quot;

Following heavy Republican losses in the 2006 midterm election, Hagel penned an editorial in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; highly critical of military strategies both employed and proposed for Iraq. He wrote that &quot;There will be no victory or defeat for the United States in Iraq,&quot; and called for a &quot;phased troop withdrawal.&quot; According to a SurveyUSA poll, in August 2006 Hagel had a 10% higher approval rating among Nebraska Democrats than Republicans.

In January 2007, Hagel openly criticized President Bush&#x27;s plan to send an additional 20,000 troops to Iraq. He called it &quot;the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in this country since Vietnam, if it&#x27;s carried out.&quot; Together with Democrats Joe Biden and Carl Levin, he proposed a non-binding resolution to the Democratic-controlled Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which rejected Bush&#x27;s policy as &quot;not in the national interest&quot; in a 12–9 vote. After an April 2007 visit to Iraq with U.S. congressman Joe Sestak (D-PA), Hagel stated his belief that the occupation of Iraq should not continue indefinitely and expressed his intention to cooperate with Senate Democrats in voting for a bill that would set a timeline to get out of Iraq.

In November 2007, he rated the Bush administration &quot;the lowest in capacity, in capability, in policy, in consensus—almost every area&quot; of any presidency in the last forty years.

===2008 presidential election===
In the 2008 presidential election, Hagel was seen as a likely choice to hold a top cabinet position in a future John McCain or Barack Obama administration. In 2006, McCain told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he would be &quot;honored to have Chuck with me in any capacity. He&#x27;d make a great Secretary of State.&quot;

Hagel was rumored to be a possible running mate for vice president for then Senator Barack Obama, in his 2008 presidential campaign. On June 20, 2008, Hagel said he would consider running with Obama if offered the VP spot, though he added that he did not believe that Obama would pick him for the position. At the time he also was mentioned as a potential United States Secretary of Defense to succeed incumbent Robert Gates in the Obama administration. Hagel said that he would consider serving if asked.

Hagel and Senator John McCain were close friends until 2007 when they diverged regarding Iraq policy; Hagel did not endorse McCain for President in the 2008 Republican primaries or in the general election. Explaining his reason for not endorsing John McCain in the 2008 election, Hagel told &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;In good conscience, I could not enthusiastically—honestly—go out and endorse him, when we so fundamentally disagree on the future course of our foreign policy and our role in the world.&quot; In August 2008, Hagel indicated that he would not endorse either candidate or get involved in their campaigns.

===Retirement from U.S. Senate===
During his first campaign, Hagel indicated that, were he to be elected, he would retire in 2008 after two terms in the Senate. In August 2004 Hagel acknowledged that he was considering a presidential campaign in 2008. In 2006 he cooperated with Charlyne Berens who wrote a biography titled &quot;Chuck Hagel: Moving Forward&quot;. On September 10, 2007, Hagel announced that he would retire and not seek a third term. Hagel also remains the last person to serve two full terms in Nebraska&#x27;s Class 2 Senate seat. He also declined to run for president in 2008. He decided to go into academia.

==Hiatus from public service (2009–2013)==
===&quot;America: Our Next Chapter&quot;===
In Hagel&#x27;s 2008 book, &quot;America: Our Next Chapter: Tough Questions, Straight Answers&quot; (with Peter Kaminsky), he suggests that the United States should adopt independent leadership and possibly another political party. He also believes that the Iraq War is one of the five biggest blunders in U.S. history. Hagel is critical of George W. Bush&#x27;s foreign policy, calling it &quot;reckless.&quot; He has been a major critic of the war since it started, and has stated that the United States should learn from its mistakes in the Vietnam War. He considered Bush&#x27;s foreign policy a &quot;ping pong game with American lives.&quot;

===Service in academia and on boards of directors===
Following Hagel&#x27;s retirement from the Senate, in February 2009 he accepted a position as Distinguished Professor in National Governance at the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. He was chairman of the Atlantic Council, a foreign policy think tank; co-chairman of President Obama&#x27;s Intelligence Advisory Board; a member of the Defense Department&#x27;s Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee and the Energy Departments Blue Ribbon Commission on America&#x27;s Nuclear Future; a member of The Washington Center&#x27;s board of directors; and a member of the Public Broadcasting Service&#x27;s board of directors. In the private sector, he served on the board of directors of Chevron Corporation, Deutsche Bank&#x27;s Americas Advisory Board, and the advisory board of Corsair Capital, and was a director of the Zurich Holding Company of America and a senior advisor to McCarthy Capital Corporation. In October 2012, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta asked Hagel to chair an advisory committee for the Vietnam War 50th anniversary commemoration. While a Senator, Hagel co-sponsored the bill creating the commemoration committee.

Hagel identifies with Ronald Reagan&#x27;s nuclear disarmament policies and was an initial signatory to the Global Zero campaign which advocates the international elimination of nuclear weaponry. He also served on the board of the Ploughshares Fund, which pursues the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and seeks to prevent their use.

===Endorsement of Senate candidates===
In 2010, Hagel endorsed Democratic Pennsylvania congressman Joe Sestak in his run for the United States Senate. In 2012 he endorsed Democrat Bob Kerrey in the race for an open U.S. Senate seat in Nebraska.

==Secretary of Defense (2013–2015)==


President Obama nominated Hagel to succeed Leon Panetta and serve as his second term Secretary of Defense on January 7, 2013. Hagel, who became, upon confirmation, the first former enlisted combat soldier to hold the office of Secretary of Defense, was interviewed by the Senate Armed Services Committee during a seven-and-a-half-hour hearing on January 31, 2013.

===Nomination process===
====Criticism of the nomination====
According to Jon Swaine writing in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Hagel has been accused of having &quot;views [that] verged on anti-Semitic&quot; due to his stating in a 2006 interview with Aaron David Miller that &quot;[t]he Jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people [on Capitol Hill]&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m not an Israeli senator. I&#x27;m a United States senator.&quot; Hagel later clarified these remarks saying he was referring to the Israel lobby. Hagel also has been criticized by the American Jewish Committee for an incident in 1999 where he was the only senator not to sign an open letter to Russian President Boris Yeltsin threatening to cut aid to Russia if it did not take action against rising anti-Semitism in the country. However, Hagel&#x27;s refusal to sign the letter was consistent with his policy of never signing letters to foreign heads of state. Hagel, instead, wrote to Bill Clinton on this issue, saying &quot;Anti-Semitism or any form of religious persecution should never be tolerated.&quot;

Hagel was criticized by &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; and many Republicans, including senator John McCain, for opposing some sanctions against Iran, and for calling for dialogue with Iran and Hamas.

Some of Hagel&#x27;s policy positions became the subject of heated debate in the Senate, including support of defense cuts, opposition to preemptive action against Iran, and support of talks with Hamas and Hezbollah. However, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; cited public opinion polls and foreign policy experts to suggest that Hagel&#x27;s views were within the mainstream of American foreign policy thought. Opponents also complained of Hagel&#x27;s 2011 call to have the Pentagon &quot;pared down&quot;, saying that &quot;[t]he Defense Department, I think in many ways, has been bloated.&quot;

The Human Rights Campaign criticized Hagel for having a &quot;consistent anti-LGBT&quot; voting record in the Senate and for opposing President Bill Clinton&#x27;s nomination of James Hormel as the U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg, stating that Hormel was &quot;openly, aggressively gay.&quot; The group demanded that Hagel apologize for this 1998 remark. The Log Cabin Republicans ran full-page newspaper ads opposing Hagel&#x27;s nomination. Hagel apologized to Hormel in December 2012. On January 24, 2013, Senator Jeanne Shaheen stated that Hagel will oppose restrictions on LGBT military family benefits. Shortly thereafter, on February 13, 2013, the Senate&#x27;s first openly LGBT member, Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) stated that after meeting with Hagel, she would support his nomination.

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina predicted that Hagel would be &quot;the most antagonistic Secretary of Defense toward the State of Israel in our nation&#x27;s history&quot; and called it an &quot;in-your-face nomination.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the media campaign opposing Hagel&#x27;s appointment was financed by new groups including a conservative group, Americans for a Strong Defense and a gay rights group, Use Your Mandate. The donors of these groups were mostly anonymous and running advertisements on issues raised by critics. The &quot;Times&quot; described the campaign as &quot;unmatched in the annals of modern presidential cabinet appointments&quot;.

====Support for the nomination====
In December 2012, nine former United States ambassadors, including five former ambassadors to Israel, wrote a letter in support of nominating Hagel. Brent Scowcroft, Anthony Zinni and nine other retired senior military officers signed a separate letter of support. Robert Gates and Colin Powell also endorsed Hagel for the nomination, with Powell calling him &quot;that kind of independent and bold leader who thinks in and out of the box&quot; who can &quot;deal with the strategic and resource challenges [the Department of Defense] will be facing over the next several years.&quot; Rabbi Aryeh Azriel, the senior rabbi at Temple Israel in Omaha, Nebraska since 1988, wrote in a CNN article that &quot;[Hagel&#x27;s] record shows strong support for Israel&quot; and that Hagel understands &quot;the Israeli people and their desire to live in peace and security.&quot; He added that &quot;Recent efforts to smear Chuck ... ultimately that hurts the long-term security of the state of Israel.&quot;

Defenses of Hagel have included opinion pieces by writers Amy Davidson, Thomas Friedman, and Robert Wright, with Wright objecting to what he called &quot;McCarthyite&quot; smears against Hagel. Jeremy Ben-Ami, President of the liberal lobby group J Street, said: &quot;The notion that Chuck Hagel is anti-Israel is ludicrous. The notion that he is anti-Semitic is slanderous.&quot; Harvard University Professor Stephen Walt, co-author of a 2007 book critical of the Israeli lobby wrote in &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; that &quot;The real meaning of the Hagel affair is what it says about the climate inside Washington. Simply put, the question is whether supine and reflexive support for all things Israeli remains a prerequisite for important policy positions here in the Land of the Free.&quot;

Commentators at &quot;The American Conservative&quot; and Pat Buchanan endorsed Hagel. Hagel&#x27;s nomination received support from Antiwar.com founder Justin Raimondo and the libertarian think tank Cato Institute; Justin Logan, director of foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, expressed the hope that Hagel&#x27;s confirmation might &quot;loosen the neoconservative stranglehold on the GOP.&quot;

====Senate hearing and votes====
During his Senate hearing opening statement Hagel said that he endorsed use of American military power, supported Israel and supported using special operations forces and unmanned combat aerial vehicles (&quot;drones&quot;) on terrorist groups in Yemen, Somalia and North Africa. He stated &quot;I believe, and always have, that America must engage—not retreat—in the world&quot;. During the hearing he explained his 2001 and 2002 votes against unilateral American sanctions on Iran as being for strategic reasons. He said he supported President Obama&#x27;s drawing down troops in Afghanistan and said he would do &quot;everything possible under current law&quot; to support gay and women service members equal benefits and combat roles.

Hagel faced sharp questioning from Republicans. Senator John McCain berated him for refusing to give a yes or no answer to the question of whether the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 was a success. Senator Lindsey Graham demanded he &quot;name one dumb thing we&#x27;ve been goaded into doing because of the pressure from the Israeli or Jewish lobby.&quot; Hagel stated &quot;I&#x27;ve already said I regret referencing the Jewish lobby, I should have said, &#x27;pro-Israel lobby. ... The use of &#x27;intimidation&#x27;—I should have used &#x27;influence.&#x27; I think that would have been more appropriate. I should not have said &#x27;dumb&#x27; or &#x27;stupid,&#x27; because I understand or appreciate there are other views on these things.&quot;. Senator Ted Cruz played video excerpts from a 2009 Al Jazeera interview and asserted that Hagel had agreed with a caller who suggested that Israel had committed war crimes. Hagel denied he agreed with that view. After the hearing, Cruz organized a letter from 25 Republican senators saying they would not vote until Hagel gave them copies of speeches given to organizations and told them the amount he was paid and whether the organizations received money from foreign sources. Lindsey Graham said they wanted to know if he spoke for any &quot;anti-Israel&quot; groups. Senate Committee chair Carl Levin said the demands were unprecedented, asking &quot;for information no prior nominee has been asked for,&quot; and expressed confidence Hagel would be approved by the Senate.

====Cloture and final vote====
Despite the committee&#x27;s February 12, 2013, 14-to-11 vote to approve Hagel, committee member James Inhofe vowed to use procedural tactics to delay a full Senate confirmation vote. Inhofe told the &quot;National Review&quot; &quot;Each day that goes by will make it more difficult for Democrats who say they are pro-Israel to hold out.&quot; On February 14 Republicans refused to close debate on Hagel&#x27;s nomination, which would require 60 votes, even though the nomination was assured the simple majority of votes needed to pass. Reasons given included a demand for more White House information about the 2012 Benghazi attack, remaining questions about Hagel&#x27;s views on Iran and Israel, and assertions two weeks after the hearings was insufficient time. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the Republicans were politically motivated and that the vote would proceed after the recess.

Senate Republicans successfully filibustered his nomination after a cloture vote failed 58–40 with one present and one not voting. This filibuster marked the first time a nominee for Secretary of Defense was successfully filibustered.

The Senate voted 71-27 for cloture on Hagel&#x27;s nomination on February 26, 2013. Later that day the Senate voted to make Hagel the Secretary of Defense by a vote of 58–41.

====Criticism of the process====
The hearings were criticized in the media. In &quot;Time&quot; magazine Brandon Friedman presented a chart showing that Israel was mentioned 106 times while Afghanistan was mentioned only 24 times; nuclear-armed Pakistan was barely mentioned. Friedman asked if the Senate committee was more concerned with Hagel&#x27;s &quot;relationship with Israel than with the future of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the fate of U.S. troops engaged in both locations.&quot; A Michael McGough Op-Ed in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was titled &quot;Hagel hearings: Is Israel more important than Afghanistan?&quot; Gene Healy in &quot;Reason&quot; called the hearings &quot;farcical&quot; and wrote there was &quot;plenty of bloviating, grandstanding and browbeating—but, apparently, not enough time for serious deliberation over key policy questions facing any new Pentagon chief.&quot;

Mark Mardell, the BBC News North America editor, criticized the &quot;whole process, which has been used not to examine a candidate&#x27;s fitness for high office, but to underline the rather obvious fact that the Obama administration does not share the world view of Republican senators, and they don&#x27;t like their former colleague joining it.&quot; Mardell noted the senators repeatedly &quot;insisted he gave a simple &#x27;yes&#x27; or &#x27;no&#x27; to complex questions. These are old men who hold themselves in high regard, but seem to see serious examination of difficult problems as a personal affront. They desperately want to play &#x27;gotcha&#x27;, but haven&#x27;t the self-restraint to design effective questions.&quot; Mardell called Senator Hagel &quot;equally unimpressive, almost unprepared, for a level of hostility that had been signalled long in advance. Neither smart, nor humble, his tactic seemed to be a kind of bumbling blandness.&quot; According to Mardell, only Cruz was effective and well-prepared, as &quot;he ripped into the nominee with all the skill honed as a Texas solicitor general.&quot;

===Tenure===

Hagel was sworn in on February 27, 2013, taking over from Leon Panetta.

In May 2013, during a visit to Asian countries whose &quot;main doubt&quot; was American staying power in the region, Hagel called the decline of American military power a &quot;good thing&quot;, because it forced American allies to share responsibilities.

On July 31, 2013, Hagel announced the results of his Strategic Choices and Management Review, undertaken in response to the budget sequestration in 2013. One of the options he highlighted was to reduce the navy&#x27;s aircraft carrier groups down from 11 to as little as eight.

On August 27, 2013, Hagel told the BBC that the United States was ready to launch a strike against Syria if given the orders.

Hagel has pushed National Guard leadership to provide benefits for same-sex domestic partnerships, as directed by the Department of Defense.

Speaking at the Halifax International Security Forum in November 2013, Hagel announced the Pentagon&#x27;s new Arctic strategy emphasizing the commitment of the United States to &quot;detect, deter, prevent and defeat threats to the United States, and continue to exercise US sovereignty in and around Alaska&quot;. He also called for more international cooperation to protect the Arctic&#x27;s environment and to keep the region &quot;peaceful, stable and free of conflict&quot;.

In December 2013, after the suspension of an Association Agreement with the EU by the Ukrainian Government of President Victor Yanukovych in November 2013 had led to massive protests, Hagel in a phone call warned the Ukrainian Minister of Defense Pavlo Lebedyev &quot;not to use the armed forces of Ukraine against the civilian population in any fashion&quot;. After Yanukovych&#x27;s impeachment and the beginning of the Crimean crisis in February 2014, Hagel warned Russia against military maneuvers &quot;that could be misinterpreted, or lead to miscalculation during a very delicate time&quot;. In several phone calls with the Russian Minister of Defense Sergey Shoygu Hagel expressed deep concerns about Russian military activities near the Ukrainian border and called for an end of any &quot;destabilizing influence inside Ukraine&quot;. He was assured by Shoygu that the Russian army would not invade Ukraine. Speaking in April 2023, Hagel said that unfortunately in 2014 the Ukrainian armed forces were in no condition to receive advanced weaponry in order to reverse the course of events.

In May 2014, speaking at the Wilson Center on the future of NATO, Hagel focused on the alliance&#x27;s imbalance in defense spending and called for &quot;renewed financial commitments from all NATO members&quot;. According to Hagel, the alliance &quot;should expect Russia to test our alliance&#x27;s purpose, stamina and commitment&quot;:

Hagel was not insensitive to the European dependence on Russian natural gas and consequent exposure to &quot;Russia’s coercive energy policies&quot;. In fact he saw even then an opportunity for North American producers. NATO&#x27;s European allies were &quot;positioned&quot; to reduce their natural gas imports from Russia by more than 25% and the U.S. Department of Energy had conditionally approved export permits for American liquefied natural gas that add up to more than half of Europe&#x27;s gas imports from Russia.

Hagel was instrumental in formulating the 2014 NATO Wales summit declaration, in which the Allies agreed to increase (over a period of ten years) their defence expenditures. The target of 2% GDP, formulated as a trial balloon at the 2006 NATO Riga summit by then-NATO Ambassador Victoria Nuland, had been scorned by most in Europe, for example Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands. Only three alliance members did so in 2014. In light of the crisis in Ukraine, the issue had assumed increased political relevance.
During his time as Secretary of Defense, he was known for the close relationship he formed with Israeli defense officials, in particular Moshe Ya&#x27;alon, who described Hagel as a &#x27;true friend&#x27;. Even as his relations with the White House deteriorated, Hagel was positively viewed by Israeli military officials, which was seen as a stark contrast to the way Hagel was perceived by some in Washington prior to his appointment.

===Resignation===
On November 24, 2014, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Hagel would be resigning from his position as Secretary of Defense under pressure from the Obama administration, in particular because of a dispute with NSA Advisor Susan E. Rice over Syria policy. The administration under Hagel&#x27;s watch had struggled to articulate a strategy to defeat ISIL in both Iraq and Syria. Later that day, President Obama announced Hagel&#x27;s resignation and thanked him for his service. Hagel said in a statement, &quot;You should know I did not make this decision lightly. But after much discussion, the President and I agreed that now was the right time for new leadership here at the Pentagon.&quot;

Hagel did not deny rumors that Obama asked for his resignation, but he explicitly contended that it was a &quot;mutual decision&quot; between him and President Obama. Senator John McCain offered his own insight: Hagel was frustrated with the White House decision-making process, national security policy, and &quot;excessive micromanagement&quot; within the White House. In December 2015, during an interview with &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;, Hagel stated he was &quot;backstabbed&quot; and accused Obama administration officials of making anonymous comments after his resignation in an effort to destroy his reputation.

Hagel continued in post until the confirmation of his successor, Ash Carter, in February 2015.

==Retirement==
In 2019 Hagel funded the annual Hagel Lecture at the University of Chicago Project for Security and Threats, and on 17 October 2019 gave a keynote speech at the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in Hamburg to address: &quot;How healthy is the ocean’s constitution? 25 Years of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea&quot;.

===2020 presidential election===
In 2020, Hagel, along with over 130 other former Republican national security officials, signed a statement that asserted that President Trump was unfit to serve another term, and &quot;To that end, we are firmly convinced that it is in the best interest of our nation that Vice President Joe Biden be elected as the next President of the United States, and we will vote for him.&quot;

Hagel, along with more than 100 Republican former national security officials, signed a letter in November 2020 that stated that the delay of the presidential transition imperiled the security of the nation. The 9/11 Commission finding that the shortened transition to the administration of George W. Bush during the disputed 2000 presidential election &quot;hampered the new administration in identifying, recruiting, clearing, and obtaining Senate confirmation of key appointees&quot; was mentioned in the statement.

Hagel, along with all other former secretaries of defense, nine in total, published a &quot;Washington Post&quot; op-ed piece in January 2021 telling President Trump not to involve the military in determining the outcome of the 2020 elections.

==Awards and honors==
In 2001, Hagel was awarded the Horatio Alger Award for Distinguished Americans. He was also granted the title of Nebraska Admiral by Nebraska&#x27;s governor, an honorary title, considering Nebraska is a landlocked state.

On June 7, 2001, Hagel gave the commencement address for North Central College and was given an honorary L.L.D. He was the keynote speaker at the College of William &amp; Mary&#x27;s Charter Day in 2007, at which he was awarded an honorary degree of Public Service. On March 3, 2008, he led a town meeting on domestic and foreign policy issues at the University of Maryland, at which the Center for American Politics and Citizenship (CAPC) gave him the Millard Tydings Award for Courage and Leadership in American Politics. Hagel served as the 2010 Clifford P. Case Professor of Public Affairs at Rutgers University&#x27;s Eagleton Institute of Politics, speaking at public programs in New Brunswick and Newark, New Jersey.

Hagel was also the featured speaker at the 2015 Annual Meeting of the American Chemistry Council at Colorado Springs.

==Personal life==
Hagel has two younger brothers: Thomas, a professor at the University of Dayton School of Law, and Michael, an artist resident in Omaha, Nebraska. Hagel&#x27;s third brother, James, died in an automobile accident at the age of 16. Hagel was raised in the Roman Catholic faith, but converted to the Episcopal Church.

In 1979, Hagel married Patricia Lloyd. The couple separated in 1981 and divorced a year later. He married his second wife, Lilibet Ziller, in April 1985. The couple live with their daughter, Allyn, and son, Ziller, in McLean, Virginia.

While a Senator, Hagel had a tradition of wearing costumes to work on Halloween, usually masquerading as one of his colleagues or other notable political figures, including Joe Biden, John McCain, Colin Powell, and Pat Roberts in past years. He gave back a portion of his salary for the 2013 fiscal year in solidarity with his department&#x27;s workers who were facing 14 days of furloughs.

Hagel is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One. In October 2022, Hagel joined Issue One&#x27;s Council for Responsible Social Media project to address the negative mental, civic, and public health impacts of social media in the United States co-chaired by former House Democratic Caucus Leader Dick Gephardt and former Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Kerry Healey.

<doc id="363278" wikidata="Q48306" url="?curid=363278" title="Nictitating membrane">
<text>The nictitating membrane (from Latin &quot;&quot;, to blink) is a transparent or translucent third eyelid present in some animals that can be drawn across the eye from the medial canthus to protect and moisten it while maintaining vision. Most Anura (tailless amphibians), some reptiles, birds, and sharks, and some mammals (such as cats, beavers, polar bears, seals and aardvarks) have full nictitating membranes; in many other mammals, a small, vestigial portion of the nictitating membrane remains in the corner of the eye. It is often informally called a third eyelid or haw; the scientific terms for it are the &quot;plica semilunaris&quot;, &quot;membrana nictitans&quot;, or &quot;palpebra tertia&quot;.

== Description ==
The nictitating membrane is a transparent or translucent third eyelid present in some animals that can be drawn across the eye for protection and to moisten it while maintaining vision. The term comes from the Latin word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;to blink&quot;. It is often called a &quot;third eyelid&quot; or &quot;haw&quot;, and may be referred to in scientific terminology as the &quot;plica semilunaris&quot;, &quot;membrana nictitans&quot;, or &quot;palpebra tertia&quot;. Unlike the upper and lower eyelids, the nictitating membrane moves horizontally across the eyeball.

In many species, any stimulus to the eyeball (such as a puff of air) will result in reflex nictitating membrane response. This reflex is widely used as the basis for experiments on classical conditioning in rabbits.

== Distribution ==
Fully developed nictitating membranes are found in fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals, but are rare in primates. In humans, the plica semilunaris (also known as the semilunar fold) and its associated muscles are homologous to the nictitating membranes seen in some other mammals and other vertebrates. In most primate species, a plica semilunaris is generally not present, although fully developed nictitating membranes can be found in lemurs and lorisoid primates. Some mammals, such as camels, polar bears, seals and aardvarks, have full nictitating membranes, and many mammals retain a small, vestigial portion of the membrane in the corner of the eye. A gland of the third eyelid (nictitans gland) or Harder&#x27;s gland is attached to the nictating membranes of some animals and may produce up to 50% of the tear film.

== Functions ==
The nictitating membrane is normally translucent. In some diving animals, including sea lions, it is activated on land, to remove sand and other debris—its function in most animals. In crocodiles, it protects their eyes from water but also hinders their focus under water. In some diving animals, for example beavers and manatees, it is transparent and moves across the eye to protect it while under water.

Birds can actively control their nictitating membrane. In birds of prey, the membrane also serves to protect the parents&#x27; eyes from their chicks while they are feeding them, and when peregrine falcons go into their dives, they will blink repeatedly with their nictitating membranes to clear debris and spread moisture across the eyes. Woodpeckers tighten their nictitating membrane a millisecond prior to their beak impacting the trunk of a tree to prevent shaking-induced retinal injury.

The nictitating membrane can be used to protect the eye while attacking prey, as in sharks.

It can also protect the eye from ultraviolet radiation, similar to its role in polar bears to prevent snow blindness.

== Vestigiality ==
Nictitating membranes in cats and dogs do not have many muscle fibers, so they are not usually visible; chronic visibility should be taken as a sign of poor condition or ill health. The membrane can, however, be seen clearly by gently opening the eye of the healthy animal when it is asleep, or by pushing down/applying pressure on the eyeball, which will cause it to appear. In some breeds of dogs, the nictitating membrane can be prone to prolapse of the gland of the third eyelid, resulting in a condition called cherry eye.

<doc id="363279" wikidata="Q22212" url="?curid=363279" title="Lindsey Graham">
<text>Lindsey Olin Graham (; born July 9, 1955) is an American politician, attorney, and former Air Force employee serving as the senior United States senator from South Carolina, a seat he has held since 2003. A member of the Republican Party, Graham chaired the Senate Committee on the Judiciary from 2019 to 2021.

A native of Central, South Carolina, Graham received his Juris Doctor degree from the University of South Carolina School of Law in 1981. Most of his active duty during his military service happened from 1982 to 1988, when he served with the Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps in the United States Air Force, as a defense attorney and then as the Air Force&#x27;s chief prosecutor in Europe, based in West Germany. Later his entire service in the U.S. Air Force Reserve ran concurrently with his congressional career. He was awarded a Bronze Star Medal for meritorious service in 2014 and held the rank of colonel.

Graham worked as a lawyer in private practice before serving one term in the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1993 to 1995. He served four terms in the United States House of Representatives for South Carolina&#x27;s 3rd congressional district from 1995 to 2003. In 2002, Graham won the U.S. Senate seat vacated by retiring Republican incumbent Strom Thurmond. He was reelected to a fourth term in 2020. In the Senate Graham advocates for strong national defense and aggressive interventionist foreign policy. Initially, he was known for his willingness to be bipartisan and work with Democrats on issues like campaign finance reform, a ban on waterboarding, cap and trade, immigration reform, and judicial nominees. He has criticized the Tea Party movement, arguing for a more inclusive Republican Party.

Graham sought the Republican nomination for president between June and December 2015, dropping out before the 2016 Republican primaries began. He was an outspoken critic of Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 candidacy and repeatedly said he did not support Trump; in particular, he took issue with Trump&#x27;s comments on Graham&#x27;s close friend, Senator John McCain. After a March 2017 meeting with Trump, Graham became a staunch ally of his, often issuing public statements in his defense. His reversal caught both parties by surprise and sparked media speculation. He became chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in January 2019, and led the U.S. Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Amy Coney Barrett, who was confirmed in October 2020.

==Early life==
Lindsey Olin Graham was born in Central, South Carolina, where his parents, Millie (Walters) and Florence James &quot;F.J.&quot; Graham, ran a restaurant/bar/pool hall/liquor store, the Sanitary Cafe. His family is of Scots-Irish descent. After graduating from D. W. Daniel High School, Graham became the first member of his family to attend college, and joined the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps. When he was 21, his mother died of Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, aged 52, and his father died 15 months later of a heart attack, aged 69. Because his then-13-year-old sister was left orphaned, the service allowed Graham to attend the University of South Carolina in Columbia so he could remain near home as his sister&#x27;s legal guardian. During his studies, he became a member of the Pi Kappa Phi social fraternity.

He graduated from the University of South Carolina with a B.A. in psychology in 1977, and from the University of South Carolina School of Law with a J.D. in 1981.

==Military service==

Upon graduating from the University of South Carolina School of Law, Graham was commissioned as an officer in the Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Corps (JAG Corps) in the United States Air Force in 1982 and began active duty that year. His duty began with a stint as an Air Force defense attorney, after which he was transferred to Rhein-Main Air Base in Frankfurt, Germany, where from 1984 to 1988 he was the Air Force&#x27;s chief prosecutor in Europe. In 1984, as he was defending an Air Force pilot accused of using marijuana, he was featured in an episode of &quot;60 Minutes&quot; that exposed the Air Force&#x27;s defective drug-testing procedures. After his service in Europe, he returned to South Carolina, leaving active duty in 1989 and entering private practice as a lawyer. He served as assistant county attorney for Oconee County from 1988 to 1992 and city attorney for Central from 1990 to 1994.
After leaving the Air Force, Graham joined the South Carolina Air National Guard in 1989, where he served until 1995, then joining the U.S. Air Force Reserve.

During the 1990–1991 Gulf War, Graham was recalled to active duty, serving as a judge advocate at McEntire Air National Guard Station in Eastover, South Carolina, where he helped brief departing pilots on the laws of war. In 1998, the Capitol Hill daily newspaper &quot;The Hill&quot; contended that Graham was describing himself on his website as an Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm veteran. Graham responded: &quot;I have not told anybody I&#x27;m a combatant. I&#x27;m not a war hero, and never said I was. ... If I have lied about my military record, I&#x27;m not fit to serve in Congress&quot;, further noting that he &quot;never deployed&quot;.

In 1998, Graham was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In 2004, he received his promotion to colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserve at a White House ceremony officiated by President George W. Bush. That year, a lower court determined that Graham&#x27;s service as a military judge while a sitting member of the Senate was acceptable. In 2006, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces set aside the lower court&#x27;s ruling after concluding it was improper for Graham to serve as a military judge.

In 2007, Graham served in Iraq as a reservist on active duty for a short period in April and for two weeks in August, where he worked on detainee and rule-of-law issues. He also served in Afghanistan during the August 2009 Senate recess. He was then assigned as a senior instructor at the Judge Advocate General&#x27;s School, though he never went.

In 2014, Graham received a Bronze Star medal for meritorious service as a senior legal adviser to the Air Force in Iraq and Afghanistan from August 2009 to July 2014, overseeing the detention of military prisoners. In 2015, he retired at his last rank of colonel from the Air Force with over 33 total years of service, after reaching the statutory retirement age of 60 for his rank. Graham earned points toward a military pension but was unpaid as an Air Force officer while a congressman and senator as he was ineligible for a military paycheck during his time in federal government service.

==South Carolina House of Representatives==
In 1992, Graham was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives from the 2nd district, in Oconee County. He defeated Democratic incumbent Lowell W. Ross by 60% to 40% and served one term, from 1993 to 1995.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1994, 20-year incumbent Democratic U.S. congressman Butler Derrick of South Carolina&#x27;s northwestern-based 3rd congressional district decided to retire. Graham ran to succeed him and, with Republican U.S. senator Strom Thurmond campaigning on his behalf, won the Republican primary with 52% of the vote, defeating Bob Cantrell (33%) and Ed Allgood (15%). In the general election, Graham defeated Democratic State Senator James Bryan Jr., 60% to 40%. As a part of that year&#x27;s Republican Revolution, Graham became the first Republican to represent the district since 1877.

In 1996, he was challenged by Debbie Dorn, the niece of Butler Derrick and daughter of Derrick&#x27;s predecessor, 13-term Democratic congressman William Jennings Bryan Dorn. Graham was reelected, defeating Dorn 60% to 40%. In 1998, he was reelected to a third term unopposed. In 2000, he was reelected to a fourth term, defeating Democratic nominee George Brightharp, 68% to 30%.

===Tenure===

In 1997, Graham took part in a leadership challenge against House Speaker Newt Gingrich.

In November 1997, Graham was one of 18 House Republicans to co-sponsor a resolution by Bob Barr that sought to launch an impeachment inquiry into President Bill Clinton. The resolution did not specify any charges or allegations. This was an early effort to impeach Clinton, predating the eruption of the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal. The eruption of that scandal ultimately led to a more serious effort to impeach Clinton in 1998. On October 8, 1998, Graham voted in favor of legislation to open an impeachment inquiry. He was a member of the Judiciary Committee, which conducted the inquiry. In both the Judiciary Committee vote on forwarding proposed articles of impeachment, and the full House vote on the proposed articles of impeachment, Graham voted for three of the four proposed articles of impeachment. He voted against the second count of perjury in the Paula Jones case. This made him the only Republican on the Judiciary Committee to vote against any of the proposed articles of impeachment. During the inquiry, Graham asked, &quot;Is this Watergate or Peyton Place?&quot; The House passed two of the impeachment articles. Graham served as a House impeachment manager in the impeachment trial.

====Committee assignments====

During his service in the House, Graham served on the following committees:
* Committee on International Relations (1995–1998)
* Committee on Education and the Workforce (1995–2002)
* Committee on the Judiciary (1997–2002)
* Committee on Armed Services (1999–2002)

==U.S. Senate==
===Elections===
====2002====

In 2002, longtime U.S. senator Strom Thurmond decided to retire. Graham ran to succeed him and won the Republican primary unopposed. In the general election, he defeated Democratic nominee Alex Sanders, the former president of the College of Charleston and former chief judge of the South Carolina Court of Appeals, 600,010 votes (54%) to 487,359 (44%). Graham thus became South Carolina&#x27;s first new U.S. senator since Fritz Hollings in 1966.

====2008====

When Graham ran for a second term in 2008, he was challenged in the Republican primary by National Executive Committeeman of the South Carolina Republican Party, Buddy Witherspoon. Graham defeated him by 186,398 votes (66.82%) to 92,547 (33.18%), winning all but one of South Carolina&#x27;s 46 counties. He then defeated the Democratic nominee, pilot and engineer Bob Conley, in the general election, 1,076,534 votes (57.53%) to 790,621 (42.25%), having outspent Conley by $6.6 million to $15,000.

====2014====
Of all the Republican senators up for reelection in 2014, Graham was considered one of the most vulnerable to a primary challenge, largely due to his low approval ratings and reputation for working with and compromising with Democrats. He expected a primary challenge from conservative activists, including the Tea Party movement, and Chris Chocola, President of the Club for Growth, indicated that his organization would support a primary challenge if an acceptable standard-bearer emerged.

But a serious challenger to Graham failed to emerge and he was widely viewed as likely to win, which has been ascribed to his &quot;deft maneuvering&quot; and &quot;aggressive&quot; response to the challenge. He befriended potential opponents from the state&#x27;s congressional delegation and helped them with fundraising and securing their preferred committee assignments; he assembled a &quot;daunting multi-million-dollar political operation&quot; dubbed the &quot;Graham machine&quot; that built six regional offices across the state and enlisted the support of thousands of paid staffers and volunteers, including over 5,000 precinct captains; he assembled a &quot;staggering&quot; campaign war chest and &quot;blanketed&quot; the state with positive ads; he focused on constituent services and local issues; and he refused to &quot;pander&quot; to the Tea Party supporters, instead confronting them head-on, arguing that the Republican Party needed to be more inclusive.

In the run-up to the Republican primary, Graham&#x27;s approval rating improved. According to a February 2013 Winthrop poll, he had a 59% positive rating among likely Republican voters. Graham won the June 10 primary with 178,833 votes (56.42%). His nearest challenger, State Senator Lee Bright, received 48,904 (15.4%).

Graham won the general election, defeating the Democratic nominee, State Senator Brad Hutto, 54% to 39%. Independent Thomas Ravenel (a former Republican State Treasurer) and Libertarian Victor Kocher received 3.8% and 2.7% of the vote, respectively.

====2020====

Democrat Jaime Harrison challenged Graham in the 2020 Senate election. The race was unexpectedly competitive, with many polls in the last few months of the race showing it as very close. Harrison also had record fundraising numbers. Despite this, Graham defeated Harrison by more than ten percentage points, 54.4% to 44.2%, in the November 3 general election.

==== 2026 ====

On January 14, 2025, Graham announced lead officials for his 2026 reelection campaign, including the former chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party and Governor Henry McMaster&#x27;s campaign manager. He reported $15.6 million in campaign fundraising. 

===Committee assignments===
In November 2018, Senator Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, announced that he would become chair of the Senate Finance Committee, and that Graham would take his place as chair of the Judiciary Committee, pending his formal selection by colleagues.

=== Relationship with Donald Trump ===

In July 2015, when Graham was a presidential candidate, he called Donald Trump, then another presidential candidate, a &quot;jackass&quot; for saying that Graham&#x27;s close friend, Senator John McCain, was &quot;not a war hero.&quot; Trump reacted by calling Graham an &quot;idiot&quot; and revealing Graham&#x27;s personal cellphone number at a campaign rally, asking people to call Graham.

In December 2015, Trump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. Graham, who had very little support as a presidential candidate, responded: &quot;He&#x27;s a race-baiting, xenophobic, religious bigot ... He doesn&#x27;t represent my [Republican] party ... I don&#x27;t think he has a clue about anything ... He is empowering radical Islam ... You know how you make America great again? Tell Donald Trump to go to hell.&quot; He added, &quot;I&#x27;d rather lose without Donald Trump than try to win with him.&quot;

In May 2016 Graham tweeted, &quot;If we nominate Trump, we will get destroyed...and we will deserve it.&quot;

In June 2016, after Trump criticized a judge of Mexican heritage, implying he could be biased, Graham said to CNN: &quot;I don&#x27;t think [Trump is] racist but he&#x27;s playing the race card ... I think it&#x27;s very un-American ... If he continues this line of attack then I think people really need to reconsider the future of the [Republican] party.&quot; Graham told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that that incident &quot;is probably it&quot; for anyone looking to withdraw their support of Trump: &quot;There&#x27;ll come a time when the love of country will trump hatred of Hillary Clinton&quot;, the Democratic nominee for president.

In the November presidential election, Graham did not vote for Trump, saying, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t go where Donald Trump wanted to take the USA &amp; GOP.&quot; He voted for independent candidate Evan McMullin.

In March 2017, Graham held a meeting with Trump. Graham said that the meeting went so well that he passed his new phone number to Trump, in reference to their 2015 conflict. In October 2017, Graham and Trump played golf together on multiple occasions, with Graham praising the first outing. In November 2017, Graham criticized the media&#x27;s reporting on Trump: &quot;What concerns me about the American press is this endless, endless attempt to label the guy some kind of kook not fit to be president.&quot; (In February 2016, Graham said of Trump: &quot;I think he&#x27;s a kook. I think he&#x27;s crazy. I think he&#x27;s unfit for office.&quot;)

In April 2018, Graham said that he would support Trump&#x27;s reelection in 2020. In January 2019, Graham said that Republicans must support Trump&#x27;s policies: &quot;If we undercut the president, that&#x27;s the end of his presidency and the end of our party.&quot;
In February 2019 Mark Leibovich interviewed Graham for &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. He asked Graham how he became a prominent Trump supporter. Graham responded that he was attempting &quot;to be relevant&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;ve got an opportunity up here working with the president to get some really good outcomes for the country ... I have never been called this much by a president in my life ... He&#x27;s asked me to do some things, and I&#x27;ve asked him to do some things in return.&quot; Graham said he had been gaining influence with Trump and was attempting to enter Trump&#x27;s inner circle, where he would reach a level of influence on par with Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. He said that he had had a &quot;political marriage&quot; with John McCain, but as for his relationship with Trump: &quot;I personally like him. We play golf. He&#x27;s very nice to me.&quot; Graham also said that a good relationship with Trump would help his prospects of reelection to the Senate in 2020.

Seven months after the death of McCain, one of Graham&#x27;s &quot;dearest friends&quot;, Trump repeatedly criticized McCain. Graham was then criticized for not standing up for McCain. Graham responded, &quot;To all those people who bring up this narrative, you just hate Trump ... You&#x27;re not offended about me and McCain; you&#x27;re trying to use me to get to Trump ... I&#x27;m not into this idea that the only way to honor John McCain is to trash out Trump.&quot; He also said, &quot;The bottom line here is I&#x27;m going to help President Trump.&quot; McCain had banned Trump from his funeral. Trump&#x27;s daughter Ivanka attended his funeral, reportedly at the invitation of Graham, who had reportedly gotten McCain&#x27;s wife&#x27;s permission. According to Graham, Trump called him after he delivered an emotional farewell to McCain on the Senate floor, telling him he &quot;did right by his friend.&quot;

On May 14, 2019, Graham came under scrutiny, including from Senator Joe Manchin, after encouraging Donald Trump Jr. to ignore a subpoena delivered by the Senate Intelligence Committee.

In July 2019, Graham said he did not think Trump was racist and that he did not think that Trump&#x27;s statements that certain Democratic congresswomen should &quot;go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came&quot; were racist. Graham said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think a Somali refugee embracing Trump would be asked to go back. If you&#x27;re racist, you want everybody to go back because they are black or Muslim.&quot; Earlier in August 2018, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Graham had said, &quot;I have never heard him make a single racist statement. Not even close.&quot;

On October 8, 2019, during an interview with Jonathan Swan of Axios, Graham condemned Trump&#x27;s announcement of an intention to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria, saying that Trump was putting the nation and his presidency at risk, and that it was without the support of key national security advisers. Media focused on Graham&#x27;s reversals and Trump&#x27;s apparent lack of appreciation for his advice.

In December 2019, as two articles of impeachment against Trump moved to a vote before the full House and referral to the Senate for trial, Graham said, &quot;I am trying to give a pretty clear signal I have made up my mind. I&#x27;m not trying to pretend to be a fair juror here&quot;, adding, &quot;this thing will come to the Senate, and it will die quickly, and I will do everything I can to make it die quickly.&quot; He also announced that he held &quot;disdain for the accusations and the process. So I don&#x27;t need any witnesses&quot; for the Senate trial. In response, Democrats referenced statements Graham made during the 1998 impeachment of Bill Clinton, including his citation of Richard Nixon as proof that a president who ignored a subpoena should be impeached for taking &quot;the power from Congress over the impeachment process away from Congress&quot; and becoming &quot;judge and jury&quot; himself. 

In April 2024, Graham criticized Trump for not supporting a federal abortion ban. In reply, Trump expressed regret for endorsing Graham in his 2020 Senate campaign. 

In January 2025, Graham took issue with a series of Trump&#x27;s first actions as president. Graham said it was &quot;a mistake&quot; for Trump to pardon criminal defendants who pleaded guilty to or were convicted of violent crimes during the January 6 attack on the Capitol, citing concerns about condoning violence and undermining support of law enforcement officers. Graham said Congress should &quot;revisit&quot; the scope of the presidential pardon power in light of the January 6 pardons and President Biden&#x27;s pardons for his family members. Next, Graham disagreed with Trump&#x27;s decision to remove the security detail provided to former National Security Advisor John Bolton and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Last, Graham defended Trump&#x27;s decision to fire 17 Inspectors General, but criticized Trump for &quot;technically&quot; violating the law by not giving Congress 30 days&#x27; notice of the firings. 

====Reaction to 2020 presidential election results====

Even after all major news networks projected that Joe Biden had won the 2020 United States presidential election, Graham said that Trump &quot;should not concede&quot; because &quot;if Republicans don&#x27;t challenge and change the U.S. election system, there will never be another Republican president elected again&quot;. Graham said he donated $500,000 to Trump&#x27;s election lawsuits in various states, and that the option should be &quot;on the table&quot; for Republican state legislators to invalidate election results due to alleged &quot;corruption&quot; by appointing presidential electors who would vote for Trump.

After receiving an affidavit by Pennsylvania postal worker Richard Hopkins alleging that his postmaster discussed backdating mail ballots, Graham issued a statement that &quot;all credible allegations of voting irregularities and misconduct be investigated to ensure the integrity of the 2020 elections&quot;, including Hopkins&#x27;s. Hopkins&#x27;s affidavit was released by Project Veritas, a controversial conservative organization known for using deceptive tactics; Project Veritas later released a recording in which Hopkins says that he did not hear his postmaster explicitly discuss backdating ballots, and that Project Veritas wrote his affidavit for him.

The 2020 United States presidential election in Georgia produced an initial count where Biden defeated Trump by around 14,000 votes, triggering a recount due to the small margin. While the recount was ongoing, Graham privately called the Georgia Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger to discuss Georgia&#x27;s vote counting. Raffensperger, a Republican, told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that Graham had asked Raffensperger whether Raffensperger could disqualify all mail-in ballots in counties with more signature errors. Gabriel Sterling, a Republican election official and staffer to Raffensperger, was present on the call; Sterling confirmed that Graham had asked that question. Raffensperger viewed Graham&#x27;s question as a suggestion to throw out legally cast ballots. Graham denied suggesting this. Graham acknowledged calling Raffensperger to find out how to &quot;protect the integrity of mail-in voting&quot; and &quot;how does signature verification work&quot;, but said that if Raffensperger &quot;feels threatened by that conversation, he&#x27;s got a problem&quot;. Graham said that he was investigating in his capacity as a senator, although he was the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He went on to claim that he had also spoken to Arizona&#x27;s and Nevada&#x27;s secretaries of state. Those secretaries denied this, and Graham reversed himself, saying that he had spoken to the governor of Arizona and no official in Nevada. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported in February 2021 that Fani Willis, the Fulton County, Georgia district attorney, was examining Graham&#x27;s phone call to Raffensperger as part of a criminal investigation into possible efforts to illegally overturn Georgia&#x27;s election results.

On January 6, 2021, Graham, Vice President Mike Pence, and members of the Senate and House were evacuated from the Capitol building after Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol. The joint session of Congress reconvened late into the night and the early morning in the Senate chamber to count and confirm the Electoral College votes. Graham spoke, disagreeing with many of his Republican colleagues, who mostly supported Trump&#x27;s denials of the election&#x27;s results, saying, &quot;it&#x27;s a uniquely bad idea to delay this election&quot;, and though &quot;I hate it&quot;, they could &quot;count me out, enough is enough&quot;. He finished by saying, &quot;Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are lawfully elected and will become the President and the Vice President of the United States on January the 20th.&quot;

In the resulting second impeachment trial of Donald Trump, Graham voted &quot;not guilty&quot;.

On May 28, 2021, Graham voted against creating the January 6 commission.

In August 2021, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Graham called Biden days after the election in an effort to revive their friendship and told Biden he had called for a special counsel investigation of Biden&#x27;s son Hunter during the campaign only to appease Trump supporters among his constituents. A Graham spokesman disputed the &quot;Times&quot;&#x27;s account.

==== 2024 election ====
Graham appeared at Trump&#x27;s first prime-time 2024 campaign rally on January 28, 2023, and told Fox News host Sean Hannity that he would support Trump &quot;because I know what I&#x27;m going to get&quot;, mostly regarding perceived international threats. Graham campaigned and publicly advocated for Trump on news programs like Meet The Press throughout the 2024 election. He also called on other prominent Republican politicians to campaign for Trump. 

In May 2024, when asked whether he would accept the results of the presidential election, Graham said he would &quot;if there&#x27;s no massive cheating&quot;.

In July 2024, after President Biden announced he would not seek reelection, Graham said he wished Biden well and that he &quot;appreciate[d] his lifelong service to our nation&quot;. 

In September 2024, with growing concern about a tie in the Electoral College, Graham visited Nebraska—one of two states without a winner-take-all vote allocation system. He lobbied Governor Jim Pillen to call a special session of the legislature to adopt the winner-take-all system, preventing Kamala Harris from receiving the state&#x27;s one Electoral College vote typically won by Democrats. Trump endorsed the change. The move failed when too few state senators agreed to call a special session.

In October 2024, Graham said Republican voters who supported Harris were supporting &quot;the most radical nominee in history of American politics&quot;. He argued that the Biden-Harris immigration policy was a larger &quot;danger to this country&quot; than Trump&#x27;s rhetoric.

Graham called Trump&#x27;s 2024 election victory &quot;the biggest comeback in American history&quot;. 

==Political positions==

Tea Party opponents have called Graham a &quot;moderate Republican.&quot; He calls himself a &quot;Reagan-style Republican&quot;, and has been called a fairly conservative Republican with &quot;a twang of moderation&quot; and &quot;an independent streak.&quot;

Much of the Tea Party criticism focuses on his willingness to be bipartisan and work with Democrats on issues like climate change, tax reform and immigration reform and his belief that judicial nominees should not be opposed solely because of their philosophical positions. He voted to confirm both of President Obama&#x27;s Supreme Court nominees, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. For his part, Graham has criticized and confronted the Tea Party, arguing for a more inclusive Republican Party. In 2023, the Lugar Center ranked Graham in the top third of senators for bipartisanship.

===Supreme Court nominations ===

In 2016, after Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia died, Republican senators boycotted Obama&#x27;s nomination of Merrick Garland. Graham said that Supreme Court vacancies should never be filled in a presidential election year and that &quot;[w]e are setting a precedent today, Republicans are.&quot; He said that if a similar situation arose, &quot;you can use my words against me and you&#x27;d be absolutely right.&quot; In an October 2018 interview, Graham said specifically that &quot;[i]f an opening comes in the last year of President Trump&#x27;s term, and the primary process has started, we&#x27;ll wait till the next election.&quot;

During the 2018 confirmation hearings following Brett Kavanaugh&#x27;s nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States, Graham took a strong stance against letting the process be further delayed by Christine Blasey Ford&#x27;s allegations. Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her decades earlier when the two were in high school. Speaking to reporters immediately after the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Ford, Graham declared himself unmoved by her testimony, doubting her recollection that it was Kavanaugh who had assaulted her.

When Kavanaugh testified before the committee the following day, Graham used his time to speak in Kavanaugh&#x27;s defense, describing him as a victim who had been put through &quot;hell&quot; by &quot;the most unethical sham&quot; he had seen in his time in politics and that if Kavanaugh was looking for fair process, he had &quot;c[o]me to the wrong town at the wrong time&quot;. A CNN commentator characterized Graham&#x27;s speech as an &quot;audition&quot; for Attorney General.

In 2019, Graham became chair of the Judiciary Committee. In May 2020, Graham said the Senate would work to confirm a Supreme Court nominee if a vacancy arose before the November election. He said &quot;Merrick Garland was a different situation. You had the president of one party nominating, and you had the Senate in the hands of the other party. A situation where you&#x27;ve got them both would be different.&quot; In August 2020, he said &quot;[a]fter Kavanaugh&#x27;s confirmation, the rules have changed as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&quot;

In September 2020, Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. Within a day, Graham expressed support for the Senate immediately voting on Trump&#x27;s nominee to succeed her. The &quot;New York Times&quot; called Graham&#x27;s position &quot;a complete and brazen reversal&quot; of his earlier stance. Graham said that in 2013, years before his 2016 pledge, Democrats had changed Senate rules to allow a simple majority vote for nominees to United States courts of appeals.

===Free speech===
During an April 3, 2011, appearance on &quot;Face the Nation&quot;, Graham &quot;suggested that Congress take unspecified though formal action against the Koran-burning by Florida preacher Terry Jones&quot;, in light of an attack on United Nations personnel triggered by Jones&#x27;s actions. Asserting that &quot;Congress might need to explore the need to limit some forms of freedom of speech&quot;, Graham argued, &quot;Free speech is a great idea, but we&#x27;re in a war,&quot; and claimed that &quot;during World War II, we had limits on what you could say if it would inspire the enemy.&quot;

===Gang of 14===
On May 23, 2005, Graham was one of the so-called Gang of 14 senators forging a compromise that brought a halt to the continued blockage of an up-or-down vote on judicial nominees. This compromise negated both the Democrats&#x27; use of a filibuster and the Republican &quot;nuclear option&quot;. Under the agreement, the Democrats retained the power to filibuster a Bush judicial nominee only in an &quot;extraordinary circumstance&quot;, and subsequently, three conservative Bush appellate court nominees (Janice Rogers Brown, Priscilla Owen and William H. Pryor Jr.) received a vote by the full Senate.

===National Security Agency surveillance===
In response to the 2013 disclosures about the United States National Security Agency and its international partners&#x27; global surveillance of foreign nationals and U.S. citizens, Graham said he was &quot;glad&quot; the NSA was collecting phone records. He said, &quot;I&#x27;m a Verizon customer. I don&#x27;t mind Verizon turning over records to the government if the government is going to make sure that they try to match up a known terrorist phone with somebody in the United States. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re talking to the terrorists. I know you&#x27;re not. I know I&#x27;m not. So we don&#x27;t have anything to worry about.&quot;

On July 25, 2013, the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations unanimously adopted an amendment by Graham to the Fiscal Year 2014 Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill that sought sanctions against any country that offered asylum to former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

===Detainee interrogations===
In July 2005, Graham secured the declassification and release of memoranda outlining concerns made by senior military lawyers as early as 2003 about the legality of the interrogations of prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay.

Of U.S. citizens accused of supporting terrorism, Graham said before the Senate, &quot;When they say, &#x27;I want my lawyer,&#x27; you tell them, &#x27;Shut up. You don&#x27;t get a lawyer. You are an enemy combatant, and we are going to talk to you about why you joined Al Qaeda.&#x27;&quot; In response to this and a June 2004 U.S. Supreme Court decision allowing detainees to file habeas corpus petitions to challenge their detentions, Graham authored an amendment to a Department of Defense Authorization Act attempting to clarify the authority of American courts. The amendment passed in November 2005 by a vote of 49–42 in the Senate despite opposition from human rights groups and legal scholars who contended that it limited the rights of detainees.

Graham has said he amended the Department of Defense Authorization Act in order to give military lawyers, as opposed to politically appointed lawyers, a more independent role in the oversight of military commanders. He has argued that two of the largest problems leading to the detainee abuse scandals at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib were this lack of oversight and troops&#x27; confusion over legal boundaries.

Graham added that military lawyers had long observed the provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the Geneva Convention, but that the Bush administration had not considered those provisions in decisions about the treatment of Guantanamo Bay detainees. He claimed that better legal oversight within the military&#x27;s chain of command would prevent future detainee abuse.

In February 2006, Graham joined Senator Jon Kyl in filing an amicus brief in the &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot; case that argued &quot;Congress was aware&quot; that the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 would strip the Supreme Court of jurisdiction to hear &quot;pending cases, including this case&quot; brought by Guantanamo detainees.

In a May 2009 CNN interview, Graham referred to the domestic internment of German and Japanese prisoners of war and U.S. Citizens as a model for domestic detention of Guantanamo detainees, saying, &quot;We had 450,000 Japanese and German prisoners housed in the United States during World War II. As a nation, we can deal with this.&quot;

===Immigration reform===
Graham was a supporter of &quot;comprehensive immigration reform&quot;, of S. 2611, the McCain-Kennedy Immigration Reform Bill of 2006, and of S. 1348, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007. His positions on immigration, and in particular collaborating with Senator Ted Kennedy, earned Graham the ire of conservative activists. The controversy prompted conservative activists to support a primary challenge in 2008 by longtime Republican national committeeman Buddy Witherspoon, but Graham won the nomination by a large margin.　

In early 2010, Graham began working with Democratic New York senator Chuck Schumer on immigration reform. The talks broke down later that year.

In July 2010, Graham suggested that U.S. citizenship as a birthright guaranteed by the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution should be amended, and that any children born to illegal immigrants in the United States should be considered illegal immigrants. He alleged, &quot;Half the children born in hospitals on our borders are the children of illegal immigrants.&quot;

In November 2012, Graham and Schumer resumed their talks on comprehensive immigration reform. On January 28, 2013, Graham was a member of a bipartisan group of eight senators that announced principles for comprehensive immigration reform. On June 23, 2013, Graham said that the Senate was close to obtaining 70 votes to pass the reform package.

In May 2019, Graham proposed instituting new immigration laws that would only allow migrants to apply for asylum from their home country or Mexico, smooth the process to deport unaccompanied children to Central America, and extend the period by which migrant children could be detained from 20 days to 100 days.

In July 2019, Graham visited a migrant detention center in Texas. He reacted that it was not &quot;a concentration camp&quot; but &quot;a facility overwhelmed&quot;. Of the migrants, Graham said, &quot;I don&#x27;t care if they have to stay in these facilities for 400 days. We&#x27;re not going to let those men go that I saw. It would be dangerous.&quot;

=== Internet and technology ===
In May 2018, Graham voted against legislation that would have overturned the FCC&#x27;s ruling and restored net neutrality.

In March 2017, Graham voted for the Broadband Consumer Privacy Proposal that removed the FCC&#x27;s internet privacy rules and allowed internet service providers to sell customers&#x27; browsing history without their permission.

In February 2022, Graham and Richard Blumenthal introduced bipartisan legislation, as part of the EARN IT Act, to incentivize tech companies to remove child sexual abuse material (CSAM) from their platforms and remove blanket immunity for violations of laws related to online child pornography.

===Gun rights===
Graham opposes extending background checks. He has said, &quot;universal background checks are going to require universal [gun] registration.&quot; He has called current gun laws &quot;broken&quot;, citing an example of a woman who pleaded guilty by reason of insanity to attempting to kill President George W. Bush, but was later able to pass a background check and buy a gun. To this end, in March 2013, he joined senators Jeff Flake, Mark Begich, and Mark Pryor in introducing a bill that would close a loophole by flagging people who attempt to buy guns who have used an insanity defense, were ruled dangerous by a court or had been committed by a court to mental health treatment. It did not address the gun show loophole.

In 2022, Graham became one of ten Republican senators to support a bipartisan agreement on gun control, which included a red flag provision, a support for state crisis intervention orders, funding for school safety resources, stronger background checks for buyers under the age of 21, and penalties for straw purchases.

===Health care===
Graham opposed President Obama&#x27;s health reform legislation; he voted against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) in December 2009, and against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. He played a leading role in efforts to repeal Obamacare, authoring the Graham–Cassidy amendment to Republicans&#x27; 2017 repeal efforts. The amendment would have given states permission to remove protections for individuals with preexisting conditions, such as allowing insurers to charge them higher prices for insurance.

Graham is a cosponsor of the Healthy Americans Act.

===Vaccines===
Graham criticized Senator Rand Paul after Paul said, &quot;I&#x27;ve heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines.&quot; Graham said that Paul was &quot;creating anxiety for no good reason&quot; and &quot;looking at this issue through a libertarian&#x27;s eyes, not a physician&#x27;s eyes&quot;.

Graham continued:

===Abortion===
In 2015, Graham sponsored the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act in the Senate, which bans abortion after 20 weeks of gestation on a national basis, with some exceptions (to save the life of the mother, or when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest). In 2018, Graham was anti-abortion, but said that &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; is precedent that should not be overturned without good reason. In 2020, he was one of 13 Republican senators who declined to sign an amicus brief asking the Supreme Court to overturn &quot;Roe&quot;.

In May 2022, Graham advocated that the Supreme Court overturn &quot;Roe&quot; to ensure that &quot;every state will decide if abortion is legal and on what terms&quot;, as this would be &quot;the most constitutionally sound way of dealing with this issue and the way the United States handled the issue until 1973.&quot; In June 2022, he asserted that all conservatives &quot;believed that there&#x27;s nothing in the Constitution giving the federal government the right to regulate abortion&quot;. In August 2022, Graham said that &quot;states should decide the issue of abortion&quot; and that he had &quot;been consistent&quot; on this.

Despite previously saying that abortion should be left up to the states, in September 2022 Graham introduced legislation to institute a federal ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy with exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the patient. He said: &quot;This is not a states&#x27; rights issue. This is a human right issue ... I am going to advocate a national minimum standard.&quot; His proposed legislation would force states to ban abortion after 15 weeks, but it would not require states to allow it up to that point.

===LGBTQ+ rights===
In 1996, Graham voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, which became federal law that year; it defined marriage as between one man and one woman, and enacted non-recognition of same-sex marriages at the federal level. Graham reiterated his support of the Defense of Marriage Act in 2022.

Graham voted to support a constitutional amendment opposing marriage between same-sex couples in 2006. He said, &quot;I believe in the traditional definition of marriage as being between one man and one woman. Traditional marriage is an institution worth protecting and this amendment will accomplish that goal. A constitutional amendment is the only effective way to cut off the growing trend among judges to create a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.&quot; After the Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, Graham said that although he disagreed with the ruling, he no longer believed that a constitutional amendment was a viable action on the issue.

In August 2022, after the House of Representatives approved a bill to recognize same-sex marriages at the federal level and that bill was sent to the Senate, Graham said that &quot;states should decide the issue of marriage [...] if you&#x27;re going to ask me to have the federal government take over defining marriage, I&#x27;m going to say no&quot;.

===Climate change===
On December 10, 2009, Graham and senators John Kerry and Joe Lieberman co-sponsored a letter to President Obama announcing their commitment to passing a climate change bill and outlining its framework. Graham was identified as a potential Republican supporter of a climate change bill and thought to be a likely sponsor of the final bill, but he pulled his support, saying that he disapproved of Senate Democrats moving forward with legislation to deal with immigration issues, a reaction to Arizona&#x27;s passage of an illegal immigration law. Graham&#x27;s withdrawal of support left passage of the climate change bill in doubt.

In June 2010, Graham told reporters, &quot;The science about global warming has changed. I think they&#x27;ve oversold this stuff, quite frankly. I think they&#x27;ve been alarmist and the science is in question. The whole movement has taken a giant step backward.&quot; He also said that he planned to vote against the climate bill he had originally co-sponsored, citing further restriction of offshore drilling added to the bill and its impact on transportation. In 2015, Graham said he &quot;completely understand[s] and accept[s]&quot; that climate change is real, but said &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; the role human activity played.

In 2020, Graham sponsored the Growing Climate Solutions Act, a bill that would make it simpler for farmers to sell carbon credits on existing carbon trading markets in California and in the Northeast.

In November 2023, Graham and Bill Cassidy co-sponsored the Foreign Pollution Fee Act. Endorsed by the Sierra Club, the bill (S. 3198; referred to the Senate Finance Committee) proposed imposing a carbon tariff on energy and industrial imports based on the good&#x27;s emission intensity or carbon footprint as compared with the same domestic good to impose a carbon price on goods from countries with greater greenhouse gas emissions than the United States.

===Foreign policy===
Graham supports an interventionist foreign policy. In 2002, he voted for the Iraq Resolution, which authorized military action against Iraq. He also supported the invasion of Iraq. Graham and senators John McCain and Joe Lieberman, who were frequently dubbed &quot;the three amigos&quot;, traveled widely, pushing for American military intervention, particularly after the September 11 attacks. Their influence reached its zenith in 2007 as President Bush advocated for his surge strategy in Iraq, declining shortly before Lieberman retired from the Senate in 2013. Kelly Ayotte, who joined the Senate in 2011, was considered Lieberman&#x27;s replacement in the group.

Graham was a frequent critic of the foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration. He threatened to derail the confirmation of Obama&#x27;s nominee for secretary of defense, Republican former senator Chuck Hagel, a centrist. Graham remarked that Hagel &quot;would be the most antagonistic secretary of defense towards the state of Israel in our nation&#x27;s history.&quot;

On February 28, 2013, Graham criticized Obama and both political parties on the Senate floor for allowing the budget reduction to occur with &quot;two-thirds of the budget&quot; exempt from reductions and said the impact on the Department of Defense would create a &quot;hollow military&quot; that &quot;invites aggression&quot;.

==== War in Afghanistan ====
Graham suggested that the U.S. stay in Afghanistan permanently, claiming that this would benefit both nations, as the U.S. would have a clear idea of what was happening in the region on a daily basis, and Afghan security forces would have an edge militarily to ensure that Afghanistan never fell back into the hands of the Taliban. He further claimed that Afghan leaders accept this long-term U.S. military presence since it benefits them, but Iran and some of its allies oppose it, a debatable claim.

Graham vehemently opposed Joe Biden&#x27;s plan to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan. He suggested that this plan puts the U.S. in danger and could cause &quot;another 9/11&quot;. Soon after the withdrawal of U.S. troops started, the Taliban launched an offensive against the Afghan government, quickly advancing in front of a collapsing Afghan Armed Forces. On July 8, 2021, Graham called President Biden&#x27;s decision a &quot;disaster in the making.&quot;

==== Iran ====
On November 6, 2010, Graham called for a preemptive military strike to weaken the Iranian regime. In 2011, he supported a continuing U.S. military presence in Iraq, saying, &quot;If we&#x27;re not smart enough to work with the Iraqis to have 10,000 to 15,000 American troops in Iraq in 2012, Iraq could go to hell.&quot;

On an episode of &quot;Fox and Friends&quot;, Graham joked that it would be &quot;terrible&quot; if a DNA test showed he had Iranian ancestry. Co-host Brian Kilmeade responded, &quot;Well, they have great people, just bad leaders,&quot; which Graham confirmed. The president of the National Iranian American Council and a number of high-profile Iranian-Americans criticized Graham&#x27;s comments.

During the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, Graham called for the U.S. to threaten Iran&#x27;s oil infrastructure if the conflict escalated. In a CNN interview, he called for the U.S. and Israel to bomb Iran even if it wasn&#x27;t involved in Hamas&#x27;s attack on Israel. He also said that the U.S. would win a war with Iran if it broke out.

==== Russia ====
In December 2010, Graham was one of 26 senators to vote against the ratification of New Start, a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the U.S. and the Russian Federation obliging both countries to have no more than 1,550 strategic warheads or 700 launchers deployed during the next seven years along with providing a continuation of on-site inspections that halted when START I expired the previous year. It was the first arms treaty with Russia in eight years.

In August 2011, Graham co-sponsored a resolution that contended that &quot;Russia&#x27;s invasion of Georgian land in 2008 was an act of aggression, not only to Georgia but to all new democracies.&quot;

On July 16, 2013, Graham suggested the United States should consider boycotting the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, because of &quot;what the Russian government is doing throughout the world&quot;.

===== Russo-Ukrainian War =====
On March 3, 2022, in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Graham tweeted, &quot;The only way this ends is for somebody in Russia to take this guy out&quot;, referring to Vladimir Putin. The tweet, which was viewed as suggesting that a Russian resident should assassinate Putin, drew backlash from American politicians, who condemned the idea and proposed heavier sanctions instead.

On May 26, 2023, the Office of the President of Ukraine released an edited video showing Graham talking to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and remarking that &quot;the Russians are dying&quot;, followed by a comment that the American military assistance to Ukraine was the &quot;best money we&#x27;ve ever spent&quot;. In response, Graham was sharply criticized by the deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia, Dmitry Medvedev. The Office of the president of Ukraine later released the unedited version of the interview, clarifying that Graham&#x27;s two remarks were unrelated.

On May 29, 2023, the Russian Interior Ministry issued an arrest warrant for Graham for his comments about the war. In response, Graham tweeted that the news brought him &quot;immense joy&quot; and that he would &quot;wear the arrest warrant issued by Putin&#x27;s corrupt and immoral government as a Badge of Honor&quot;. In a follow-up tweet, Graham added that he would submit to the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court (ICC) should Russia attempt to serve the warrant.

On February 13, 2024, Graham voted against the Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan appropriations bill because it included an effort by senators James Lankford, Kyrsten Sinema, and Chuck Schumer to control the US-Mexico border. In April, the House returned the appropriations as four separate bills. Graham joined 79 colleagues and the majority of his caucus in passing the appropriations, which Schumer packaged as one bill.

==== Libya ====
Graham supported the NATO-led military intervention in Libya. On January 29, 2013, Graham said that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton &quot;got away with murder&quot; after her testimony about the 2012 Benghazi attack, but the next year he said that the House Intelligence Committee report on Benghazi was &quot;full of crap&quot; and that the Obama administration had been cleared of many of the charges therein.

==== Israel/Palestine ====

On January 5, 2017, Graham condemned Obama for abstaining from UN Security Council Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the West Bank and eastern Jerusalem as a violation of international law.

On March 11, 2019, Graham said he would encourage the Trump administration to recognize the Golan Heights as part of Israel.

On October 10, 2023, Graham tweeted that he &quot;unapologetically stand[s] with Israel&quot; during the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. He called the conflict a &quot;religious war&quot; and said that Gaza should be &quot;flattened&quot;. On October 31, 2023, Graham said that no amount of civilian casualties in Gaza would lead him to question Israel&#x27;s goal of eradicating Hamas.

On March 9, 2024, Graham said, &quot;For decades now, Palestinian children have been taught through UNRWA and other agencies to kill all the Jews&quot; and &quot;somebody needs to pull the Palestinian school system up by its roots and destroy it.&quot;

On May 8, 2024, Graham warned the Pentagon against halting arms supply to Israel during the Israel–Hamas war, saying, &quot;Give Israel what they need to fight the war they can&#x27;t afford to lose. This is Hiroshima and Nagasaki on steroids.&quot; This statement caused a debate in the Japanese National Diet. Taku Yamazoe and Jin Matsubara protested to Foreign Minister Yōko Kamikawa. Matsubara said, &quot;The US is Japan&#x27;s greatest ally, but the Japanese should be firm with the US on lines that they cannot cross.&quot; Kamikawa told the parliamentary committee, &quot;The atomic bombings took many precious lives and forced people to face unspeakable hardships such as illnesses and disabilities, creating a situation that is extremely regrettable from a humanitarian point of view.&quot; She emphasized that the use of nuclear weapons is &quot;not consistent with the spirit of humanitarianism because of their tremendously destructive and lethal power.&quot; On 14 May, Kamikawa said that Graham&#x27;s remarks were &quot;extremely regrettable&quot;. Nihon Hidankyō sent a letter of protest to the U.S. Embassy in Japan that said: &quot;This statement is also in violation of international humanitarian law. With the Nuclear Weapons Convention now in effect, it can only be called an anachronistic and malicious delusion&quot;.
On May 10, Graham said that he trusts Israel more than he does U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin.

On May 11, Graham and 11 other Republican senators introduced a resolution condemning the Biden administration&#x27;s actions to withhold or restrict ammunition and weapons to Israel.

In a May 12 interview, Graham again defended bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki to end World War II and said, &quot;Give Israel the bombs they need to end the war. They can&#x27;t afford to lose.&quot; This statement attracted international attention. The Independent, Al Jazeera and India Today reported that Graham suggested that a nuclear strike on Gaza should be carried out. The South China Morning Post columnist Alex Lo wrote that the American ruling elite is becoming unhinged, bringing up one American genocide after another to justify the Israeli genocide. Hamas issued a statement on the remarks referring to Graham&#x27;s &quot;deep moral decline and the genocide and colonialism mentality that he harbors&quot; and calling him &quot;among the U.S. political elite, who align themselves with a full-fledged genocidal crime committed by the amoral Israeli army against isolated civilians&quot;. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said, &quot;These horrible statements by an American senator in justifying and encouraging the use of nuclear bombs by the Zionist regime reflect the brutality of those who advocate war and disregard human rights and international resolutions.&quot;

On May 20, in response to ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan&#x27;s announcement of his intention to seek arrest warrants of senior Israeli officials in connection to war crimes committed in the Israel–Hamas war, Graham called for sanctions to be placed on the ICC and said: &quot;This outrageous decision is truly a slap in the face to the independent judiciary of Israel, which is renowned for their independence.&quot; He added, &quot;If they do this to Israel, we&#x27;re next&quot;.

On May 29, Graham met with Netanyahu and called ICJ President Nawaf Salam a &quot;raving antisemite&quot;. Graham has visited Israel five times since the Hamas attack on October 7, and Netanyahu said he has no better friend for Israel than Graham.　

On July 5, Graham said, &quot;The Palestinians in Gaza are the most radicalized population on the planet, who are taught to hate Jews from birth&quot;. CAIR issued a statement condemning his remark.

On Nov 23, Graham argued that, in response to the ICC arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, allied countries such as Canada, the UK, Germany, and France should be sanctioned if they assist the ICC.

==== Venezuela ====
In May 2019, Graham called for a military invasion of Venezuela to overthrow Nicolás Maduro amid the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis.

==== Niger ====
In October 2017, in the wake of the Tongo Tongo ambush, which killed four U.S. soldiers, Graham said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know there was a thousand troops in Niger.&quot; A few days later, he called for an expanded role of the U.S. military in Niger: &quot;You&#x27;re going to see more actions in Africa, not less; you&#x27;re going to see more aggression by the United States toward our enemies, not less; you&#x27;re going to have decisions being made not in the White House but out in the field.&quot;

==== Syria ====
In July 2018, Graham and Senator Jeanne Shaheen visited Manbij in Syria and met the Manbij Military Council, which led an offensive to liberate the city from ISIS in 2016 with help from the US-led coalition.

==== Saudi Arabia ====
In March 2015, Graham supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, saying, &quot;We want to have a relationship with Saudi Arabia. They&#x27;re a strategic partner. They&#x27;re a mortal enemy of the Iranians.&quot; In June 2019, he was one of seven Republicans to vote to block Trump&#x27;s Saudi arms deal providing weapons to Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Jordan, and one of five Republicans to vote against an additional 20 arms sales. In late 2019, Graham took a warmer approach toward Saudi Arabia. He praised the Trump administration for sending thousands of additional troops to Saudi Arabia to counter Iran&#x27;s threat. He also praised Saudi Arabia for opening its airspace to Israeli flights.

Turkey

In October 2019, Graham said he would &quot;introduce bipartisan sanctions against Turkey if they invade Syria&quot; and that he would &quot;call for their suspension from NATO if they attack Kurdish forces who assisted the US in the destruction of the ISIS Caliphate.&quot;

==== Armenian genocide ====
In November 2019, Graham blocked a Senate resolution to officially recognize the Armenian genocide. In December 2019, he voted for the resolution, which passed the Senate unanimously.

=== Robert Mueller&#x27;s investigation ===

In January 2018, and in the first known congressional criminal referral in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Graham and Chuck Grassley recommended charges against ex-MI6 officer Christopher Steele, named as author of the Steele dossier. Grassley and Graham said that they had reason to believe that Steele had lied to federal authorities. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;It was not clear why, if a crime is apparent in the F.B.I. reports that were reviewed by the Judiciary Committee, the Justice Department had not moved to charge Mr. Steele already. The circumstances under which Mr. Steele is alleged to have lied were unclear, as much of the referral was classified.&quot;

In April 2018, after the FBI raid on the hotel room and offices of Trump&#x27;s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, Graham, Cory Booker, Chris Coons, and Thom Tillis introduced new legislation to &quot;limit President Trump&#x27;s ability to fire special counsel Robert Mueller.&quot; Termed the Special Counsel Independence and Integrity Act, the legislation would allow any special counsel, in this case Mueller, receive an &quot;expedited judicial review&quot; in the 10 days after being dismissed to determine whether the dismissal was appropriate. If not, the special counsel would be reinstated. At the same time, according to &quot;The Hill&quot;, the bill would &quot;codify regulations&quot; that a special counsel could only be fired by a senior Justice Department official, having to provide reasons in writing.

On March 14, 2019, Graham blocked a resolution calling for Mueller&#x27;s report to be made public after it passed the House unanimously.

After Mueller&#x27;s testimony to two congressional committees on July 24, 2019, Graham speculated that &quot;the Mueller report is in name only. It clearly wasn&#x27;t the Mueller report. It was just in name.&quot; On June 25, 2019, Graham said, &quot;The president gave 1.4 million documents to Mueller. [Don] McGahn, his lawyer, testified for 30 hours. He made everybody available to Mueller that Mueller wanted to talk to, and he... answered questions in writing, so this president did nothing to stop Mueller from finding the truth.&quot;

===Taxation===
Although Graham signed Grover Norquist&#x27;s Taxpayer Protection Pledge in June 2012, he went on record supporting the closure of tax loopholes without compensating decreases in other tax revenue, saying, &quot;We&#x27;re so far in debt that if you don&#x27;t give up some ideological ground, the country sinks.&quot;

===Trade===
The Cato Institute&#x27;s Center for Trade Policy Studies identifies Graham, during his U.S. House and U.S. Senate tenure, as having a mostly protectionist and pro-subsidies voting record.

===2015 Charleston church shooting and Confederate flag issue===
After a mass shooting at a historic African American church in Charleston on June 17, 2015, Graham canceled all campaign events to return to South Carolina. In response to questions from the press regarding the calls from some to remove the Confederate flag at a war memorial on the South Carolina State Capitol grounds, Graham said, &quot;Well, at the end of the day it&#x27;s time for people in South Carolina to revisit that decision. [That] would be fine with me, but this is part of who we are.&quot; He continued, &quot;The flag represents to some people a civil war, and that was the symbol of one side. To others it&#x27;s a racist symbol, and it&#x27;s been used by people—it&#x27;s been used in a racist way.&quot; Of the shooter responsible for the incident, Graham said, &quot;We&#x27;re not going to give this a guy an excuse about a book he might have read, or a movie he watched, or a song he listened to, or a symbol out anywhere. It&#x27;s him ... not the flag.&quot;

In a statement issued later, Graham said, &quot;There can be no doubt that the shooting ... was racially motivated and signals to all of us that the scars of our history are still with us today. This murderer said he wanted to start a race war; he has failed miserably. In Charleston this weekend, I saw a community coming together. I saw people seeking solace in what they share together, not in what makes them different.&quot;

===Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023===
Graham was among the 31 Senate Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.

== Campaign contributions ==

In 2016, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported that Graham was &quot;the only Republican recipient of money from a major Democratic donor now facing scrutiny for some questionable campaign donation habits.&quot; The Thornton Law Firm is nationally known for its expertise in asbestos-related litigation. Over a ten-year period, Graham received $62,800 in campaign contributions from the firm&#x27;s partners. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; found that the firm, in almost every case, would reimburse partners&#x27; political contributions—in the exact amount—within 10 days of the contributions being made. Between 2010 and 2014, the firm&#x27;s partners and one of their wives contributed $1.6 million to politicians; $1.4 million was given back to the partners from the firm. The firm told reporters that according to outside consultants the practice was not unlawful because the checks are not bonuses, instead coming out of the partners&#x27; firm equity accounts.

A spokesman for Graham said that Graham would return the money he received from the firm&#x27;s lawyers if the law firm were indicted or convicted on corruption charges.

==Presidential politics==
Graham supported John McCain for president in 2000 and served as national co-chair of McCain&#x27;s 2008 presidential campaign.

In 2012, Graham&#x27;s endorsement was highly sought, but he declined to endorse a Republican candidate before the January South Carolina Republican primary. After Rick Santorum withdrew from the race in April 2012, leaving Mitt Romney as the presumptive nominee, Graham endorsed Romney.

During his Senate reelection race in October 2014, while discussing immigration and foreign policy issues with a reporter from &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;, Graham said, &quot;If I get through my general election, if nobody steps up in the presidential mix, if nobody&#x27;s out there talking ... I may just jump in to get to make these arguments.&quot; On March 7, 2015, at a &quot;Politics and Pies&quot; forum, Graham advocated the reversal of defense spending cuts and quipped: &quot;If I were President of the United States, I wouldn&#x27;t let Congress leave town until we fix this. I would literally use the military to keep them in if I had to.&quot;

On April 19, 2015, Graham told Chris Wallace, on the &quot;Fox News Sunday&quot; show, that he was &quot;91% sure&quot; he would run for president. &quot;If I can raise the money, I&#x27;ll do it,&quot; he said. On May 18, 2015, Graham informally announced that he would run for president on &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;, saying he was running because he thinks &quot;the world is falling apart.&quot;

Graham announced his candidacy for President on June 1, 2015.

On December 21, 2015, Graham suspended his presidential campaign, due to lack of support and poor polling, and on January 15, 2016, endorsed former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. After it appeared certain that Donald Trump would become the Republican nominee in May 2016, Graham announced that he would not vote for Trump or Hillary Clinton, commenting: &quot;I think Donald Trump is going to places where very few people have gone and I&#x27;m not going with him.&quot; On November 8, 2016, Graham announced that he had voted for Evan McMullin.

==Electoral history==
*Write-in and minor candidate notes: In 1994, write-ins received 13 votes. In 2000, Natural Law candidate LeRoy J. Klein received 1,122 votes and write-ins received 33 votes. George Brightharp ran under both the Democratic and United Citizens Parties and received 2,253 votes on the United Citizen line.


===Primary elections===








==Personal life==
Graham helped raise his sister, Darline Graham Nordone, after the deaths of his mother and father, which occurred within 15 months of each other, leaving the two without parents when Graham was 22 and she was 13. Graham has said that his parents&#x27; early deaths made him mature more quickly, and Nordone, who introduced her brother at his 2016 announcement of his candidacy for president, said she hoped to be with him on the campaign trail frequently to show voters his softer side. &quot;He&#x27;s kind of like a brother, a father and a mother rolled into one,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#x27;ve always looked up to Lindsey.&quot;

Having never married or had children, Graham has said, &quot;I never found time to meet the right girl, or the right girl was smart enough not to have time for me.&quot; According to his memoir, while in law school, he had a girlfriend named Debbie, and two more during his time in the Air Force in Germany: a JAG officer named Carol who later served on Colin Powell&#x27;s staff, and a flight attendant named Sylvia, whom he considered proposing to. He has denied being gay.

Graham lives in Seneca, South Carolina. A Southern Baptist, he is a member of Seneca&#x27;s Corinth Baptist Church.

<text>Charles Patrick Roberts (born April 20, 1936) is a retired American politician and journalist who served as a United States senator from Kansas from 1997 to 2021. A member of the Republican Party, Roberts served 8 terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, from 1981 to 1997, before his election to the Senate.

Born in Topeka, Kansas, Roberts is a graduate of Kansas State University. He served as a First Lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps and worked as a newspaper reporter before entering politics in the late 1960s. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1980 to succeed 1st District Congressman Keith Sebelius, for whom he had worked. He served eight terms in the House, including one as chairman of the House Agriculture Committee.

Roberts was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1996. On the Intelligence Committee, he was responsible for an investigation into the intelligence failures prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He was the dean of Kansas&#x27;s congressional delegation and Chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee (ANF). He is the first person to chair both the House and the Senate agriculture committees.

On January 4, 2019, Roberts announced that he would not seek reelection in 2020. He was succeeded by Representative Roger Marshall of Great Bend on January 3, 2021.

==Early life, education, and early political career==

Roberts was born on April 20, 1936, in Topeka, Kansas, the son of Ruth B. (née Patrick) and C. Wesley Roberts. His father served for four months as Chairman of the Republican National Committee under Dwight D. Eisenhower. Roberts&#x27;s great-grandfather, J.W. Roberts, was the founder of the &quot;Oskaloosa Independent&quot;, which is the second-oldest newspaper in Kansas.

Roberts graduated in 1954 from Holton High School in Holton, Kansas. He went on to earn a B.A. in Journalism from Kansas State University in 1958, where he became a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. From 1958 to 1962, he served as an officer in the U.S. Marine Corps, achieving the rank of First Lieutenant. Roberts was a reporter and editor for several Arizona newspapers between 1962 and 1967, when he joined the staff of Republican Kansas Senator Frank Carlson. In 1969, he became administrative assistant to Kansas&#x27;s 1st District Congressman Keith Sebelius.

==U.S. House of Representatives (1981–1997)==


===Elections===

After Keith Sebelius announced his retirement, Roberts easily won the Republican primary, which was tantamount to election in the heavily Republican 1st District. He was re-elected seven times without serious difficulty, never receiving less than 60 percent of the vote; in 1988, he ran unopposed.

===Committee assignments===
Roberts served as the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee from 1995 to 1997.

===Sponsored Legislation that became Law===
* Public Law 99-624: Dwight David Eisenhower Centennial Commission Act
* Public Law 101-353: To designate the Agricultural Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, animal health research building in Clay Center, Nebraska, as the &quot;Virginia D. Smith Animal Health Research Laboratory&quot;
* Public Law 104-107: Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996

==U.S. Senate (1997–2021)==
===Elections===
====1996====

After Republican Senator Nancy Kassebaum declined to seek a fourth term, Roberts ran to succeed her. He easily won the Republican primary, defeating three minor candidates with 78% of the vote. In the general election, he faced Democratic State Treasurer Sally Thompson. Term limits were an issue during the campaign; while Roberts said he was not totally opposed to term limits, he was wary of limits that did not apply to current members of Congress, saying the proposed limits should apply to everyone. While Thompson signed the national term limits pledge from the group Americans for Limited Terms, Roberts declined to do so, becoming the only major party candidate for the U.S. Senate in the 1996 elections to not sign the pledge. However, he did say that &quot;I plan only to serve two terms in the U.S. Senate.&quot; Despite that stated intention, he eventually served four terms.

In the general election, Roberts defeated Thompson by 652,677 votes (62.02%) to 362,380 (34.44%), almost certainly helped by the presence of former Kansas Senator Bob Dole atop the ticket as the Republican presidential nominee.

====2002====
Roberts was opposed in the Republican primary by Tom Oyler, who had run against him in 1996. Roberts defeated him 84% to 16%. No Democratic candidate opposed him in the general election; he faced only Libertarian nominee Steven Rosile and Reform nominee George H. Cook, defeating them by 641,075 votes (82.52%) to 70,725 (9.10%) and 65,050 (8.37%), respectively.

====2008====
Roberts was unopposed in the Republican primary and defeated the Democratic nominee, former Congressman Jim Slattery, in the general election by 727,121 votes (60.06%) to 441,399 (36.46%).

====2014====

In the 2014 election, Roberts faced a hard-fought primary challenge from physician Milton R. Wolf. Wolf received several endorsements from national organizations associated with the Tea Party movement. Roberts defeated Wolf in the Republican primary by 125,406 votes (48.12%) to 106,202 (40.75%). In the general election, for the second time in his tenure, Roberts did not face a Democratic opponent; Democratic nominee Chad Taylor withdrew from the race. Roberts won the general election, obtaining 53.15% of the vote; Independent Greg Orman received 42.53%, while Libertarian nominee Randall Batson received 4.32%.

===Tenure===

Despite being the longest-serving member of the Kansas delegation, Roberts spent the first 14 years of his Senate career as Kansas&#x27;s &quot;junior&quot; senator, since Sam Brownback had taken office on election day 1996 to finish out Dole&#x27;s term. However, after Brownback gave up his seat to make a successful run for governor, Roberts became Kansas&#x27;s senior senator.

Roberts was a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, chairing the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities. This subcommittee oversaw the military&#x27;s work in the area of homeland security and the efforts to prevent proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons.

After winning the 2008 Presidential election, Barack Obama nominated Tom Daschle for United States Secretary of Health and Human Services. In February, after Daschle offered a public apology for his failure to pay income taxes on use of a luxury car and driver, Roberts declined to state his opinion of Daschle&#x27;s explanation and stated that sentiment for the nomination in Kansas was &quot;not especially good&quot;. Daschle subsequently withdrew.

In March 2009, Roberts was one of fourteen senators to vote against a procedural move that essentially guaranteed a major expansion of a national service corps. The bill was estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to cost at least an outlay for the fiscal year 2010 of $418million toward around $5.7billion from 2010 through 2014.

In May 2009, President Obama nominated Sonia Sotomayor for Supreme Court Associate Justice. Roberts had previously voted against Sotomayor with twenty-eight other Republicans when she was nominated for the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. In an interview shortly after the nomination, Roberts was asked if he would vote for Sotomayor to avoid being called a &quot;bigot&quot; and answered, &quot;I’m a Marine and nothing much scares me. That&#x27;s not going to be a consideration in my vote.&quot; Roberts stated his reasons for voting against Sotomayor in 1998 in a separate interview, and that he did &quot;not plan to vote for her&quot;. Roberts&#x27;s comments were significant for his being the first Republican to announce how he would vote on the Sotomayor nomination. Sotomayor was confirmed in August in a vote of 68 to 31 with Roberts voting against the nomination.

President Obama&#x27;s top domestic agenda at the start of his presidency was to ensure health insurance for all Americans, which entailed Democrats in Congress scaling back their proposals in attempts to trim tens of billions of dollars a year from existing health programs. Roberts pushed back against a proposal by the Obama administration to use $600billion of Medicare and Medicaid savings to pay for health care legislation, saying, &quot;More cuts to Medicare? Let’s not do that right now, please.&quot;

Roberts rose to the Chair of the Committee on ANF in the 2014-2016 114th Congress. He continued to chair the Committee for the duration of his tenure in the 115th Congress and the 116th Congress.

In June 2016, the &quot;Roberts GMO bill&quot; which had come out of the Committee on ANF was proposed as an amendment to Public Law 114-214 by Mitch McConnell. Public Law 114-214 was also known to opponents as the DARK Act, for &quot;Deny Americans the Right to Know&quot; about GMO foods.

In February 2019, when asked about comments by House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson regarding the passage of the reauthorization of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Pesticide Registration Enhancement Act, Roberts stated his support for both, and in passing child nutrition reauthorization legislation.

Roberts served as chairman of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial Commission, dedicating the memorial on September 17, 2020, after many years of planning.

In September 2020, with less than two months to the next presidential election, Roberts supported an immediate vote on President Trump&#x27;s nominee to fill the Supreme Court vacancy caused by the death of justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Roberts argued that it was the &quot;Senate’s constitutional duty to fill vacancies on the Supreme Court&quot;. Previously in March 2016, around seven months before the next presidential election, Roberts argued that President Obama&#x27;s Supreme Court nominee should not be considered by the Senate, as the process would be &quot;rushed&quot;, and that this was &quot;about giving the American people and the next president a role in selecting the next Supreme Court justice&quot; via the upcoming presidential election.

===Agriculture Committee attendance===

During his tenure in the Senate, Roberts missed 130 (65%) of his Agriculture Committee meetings. The Agriculture Committee is responsible for farm, nutrition and forestry issues.

===Controversy===

While participating in negotiations over the Republican-sponsored American Healthcare Act, Roberts was asked by Alice Ollstein if he supported a proposed revision to mandated coverage in the bill. He responded: &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t want to lose my mammograms.&quot; This comment was widely condemned. Roberts subsequently apologized.

===Sponsored legislation===

* Public Law 108-144: A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 3710 West 73rd Terrace in Prairie Village, Kansas, as the &quot;Senator James B. Pearson Post Office&quot;
* Public Law 108-207: An original bill to extend the final report date and termination date of the 9/11 Commission, to provide additional funding for the Commission, and for other purposes

===Caucuses===

Senate Republican Conference

==Political positions==
===Social issues===

Roberts is anti-abortion, opposes same-sex marriage, and denied Americans the right to know about GMO foods as part of Public Law 114-214.

====Healthcare and Obamacare====

Roberts opposed President Barack Obama&#x27;s health reform legislation; he voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in December 2009, and he voted against the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.
In September 2017, Roberts supported the Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill. When interviewed about why he supported it, Roberts repeatedly refused to say why he thought the bill was good, and avoided speaking about the bill&#x27;s policy contents. Instead, he said he supported the bill because it was the last best chance to repeal Obamacare.

====GMO foods law====

Roberts introduced a biotech labeling and GMO foods bill on February 19, 2016. The bill aims to establish a standardized voluntary labeling plan that would block the state of Vermont from enacting its mandatory genetic engineering labeling law on July1 of that year. In addition it seeks to promote &quot;consumer acceptance of agricultural biotechnology&quot;. The Roberts GMO bill was supported by the Grocery Manufacturers of America, the Food &amp; Agriculture, Biotechnology Innovation Organization, the American Bakers Association, the International Dairy Foods Association, and the Snack Food Association amongst others in the face of the opposition for more than a decade of more than 90% of the public. It was noted that the World Health Organization, the American Medical Association, the National Academy of Sciences and &quot;the concerted advocacy of 107 concerned Nobel laureates&quot; all were in favour of GMO foods. The &quot;fait accompli&quot; fallacy was used by a writer for &quot;National Geographic&quot; to conclude her article in favour of the Roberts bill, whereas labeling of GMO food is mandated in at least 64 countries, including most European countries, China, Russia, Japan, Brazil, South Africa, and Australia.

The bill was engrossed into Public Law 114-214. At the time, Vermont governor Peter Shumlin said that &quot;For a Republican-controlled Congress that continually argues for states’ rights to act to take away Vermonters’ right to know what is in their food is the height of hypocrisy and a sad statement on the power of special interests in Congress.&quot; An environmental advocacy organization said that &quot;the food lobby spent over $100 million in the fight to block GMO labeling in 2015&quot;.

President Obama signed the bill into law on July 29, 2016.

====Environment====

Roberts worked to secure $15million for research on carbon sequestration. On the topic of global warming, Roberts has said, &quot;There&#x27;s no question there&#x27;s some global warming, but I&#x27;m not sure what it means. A lot of this is condescending elitism.&quot;

Roberts voted to confirm Gale Norton as Secretary of the Interior, to exclude oil and gas smokestacks from mercury regulations, and to reclassify the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a Cabinet department.

In 2012, Roberts introduced an amendment that would open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling for oil and approve the Keystone XL Pipeline.

In 2017, Roberts was one of 22 senators to sign a letter to President Donald Trump urging the President to have the United States withdraw from the Paris Agreement. According to OpenSecrets, Roberts has received over $415,000 from oil, gas and coal interests since 2012.

====Education====

In January 2014, Roberts introduced the Opportunities Created At the Local Level Act. The bill would allow states to freely choose without federal intervention in their education standards, testing and curricula.

In February 2019, Roberts was one of twenty senators to sponsor the Employer Participation in Repayment Act, enabling employers to contribute up to $5,250 to the student loans of their employees as a means of granting employees relief and incentivizing applicants to apply to jobs with employers who implement the policy.

====Domestic security====

Roberts supports the Patriot Act, and the President&#x27;s authority for warrantless surveillance. Roberts was the only senator blocking the nomination of Army Secretary Eric Fanning. Roberts&#x27;s refusal to lift his hold on the nomination until President Obama promised to never move anyone from the Guantanamo Bay detention camp to Fort Leavenworth drew criticism on the Senate floor from Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, who noted that the United States Secretary of the Army has no control over the detainees.

====Intelligence program====

The 2004 Intelligence Authorization Act saw the creation of the Pat Roberts Intelligence Scholars Program. The program links undergraduate and graduate students with US security and intelligence agencies&quot; by providing funding to selected US students entering university, in return for a commitment to join the agency for at least 18 months on graduation. PRISP is a decentralized program which funds students through various intelligence agencies.

====Investigation into pre-war intelligence on Iraq====

As chairman of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Roberts was responsible for the committee&#x27;s investigation into the intelligence failures prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The first half of the Senate Report of Pre-war Intelligence on Iraq was released on July 9, 2004. The second half, according to language voted on by the full Committee, consists of five parts including: whether public statements and reports and testimony regarding Iraq by U.S. Government officials made between the Gulf War period and the commencement of Operation Iraqi Freedom were substantiated by intelligence information; the postwar findings about Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction and weapons programs and links to terrorism and how they compare with prewar assessments; prewar intelligence assessments about postwar Iraq; any intelligence activities relating to Iraq conducted by the Policy Counterterrorism Evaluation Group (PCTEG) and the Office of Special Plans within the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy; and the use by the Intelligence Community of information provided by the Iraqi National Congress (INC).

====Immigration====

A member of the House of Representatives at the time, Roberts voted against Ronald Reagan&#x27;s 1986 immigration limited amnesty bill.

In June 2018, Roberts was one of thirteen Republican senators to sign a letter to Attorney General Jeff Sessions requesting a moratorium on the Trump administration family separation policy while Congress drafted legislation. He is in favor of increasing border patrols to reduce undocumented immigrant flow.

====Net neutrality====

In May 2018, Roberts voted against a bill that would reinstate net neutrality rules and thereby overturn the FCC&#x27;s repeal via a law authorizing Congress to reverse regulatory actions by a simple majority vote.

====Taxes====

In March 2019, Roberts was a cosponsor of a bipartisan bill to undo a drafting error in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that mandated stores and restaurants to have to write off the costs of renovations over the course of 39 years via authorizing businesses to immediately deduct the entirety of costs of renovations.

====United States Postal Service====

In March 2019, Roberts was a cosponsor of a bipartisan resolution led by Gary Peters and Jerry Moran that opposed privatization of the United States Postal Service (USPS), citing the USPS as an establishment that was self-sustained and noting concerns that a potential privatization could cause higher prices and reduced services for customers of USPS with a particular occurrence in rural communities.

===Gun law===

Roberts has an &quot;A&quot; rating from the National Rifle Association of America (NRA) for his consistent, ongoing support of pro-gun legislation. The NRA endorsed Roberts in the 2014 election; the NRA-Political Victory Fund chairman said, &quot;Pat is the only ally and battle-tested candidate in this race who has consistently protected our Second Amendment freedoms.&quot; Since 1998, the NRA has provided Roberts $23,800 in donations.

One month after the Orlando nightclub shooting Roberts voted for two Republican-backed proposals on gun policy: Chuck Grassley&#x27;s amendment to increase funding for background checks and John Cornyn&#x27;s policy that would have put a 72-hour hold on any terrorist suspect buying a gun. He voted against both the Democrat&#x27;s policies, including the Feinstein Amendment, which banned suspected terrorists from buying guns. Roberts voted against the Manchin-Toomey amendment to expand background checks for gun purchases.

In the immediate aftermath of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Roberts said it was &quot;too early&quot; to discuss gun policy change.

In February 2018, after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in which 17 were killed, Roberts came out in favor of age limits on the AR-15, the weapon used at the high school shooting. Roberts said, &quot;Certainly nobody under 21 should have an AR-15. I don&#x27;t know why anybody would want an AR-15 unless they&#x27;re going to take one out on the shooting range.&quot;

In January 2019, Roberts was one of thirty-one Republican senators to cosponsor the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, a bill introduced by John Cornyn and Ted Cruz which would grant individuals with concealed carry privileges in their home state the right to exercise this right in any other state with concealed carry laws while concurrently abiding by that state&#x27;s laws.

===Foreign policy===

In December 2010, Roberts voted against the ratification of New START, a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the United States and Russian Federation obliging both countries to have no more than 1,550 strategic warheads as well as 700 launchers deployed during the next seven years along with providing a continuation of on-site inspections that halted when START I expired the previous year. It was the first arms treaty with Russia in eight years.

In September 2016, Roberts was one of thirty-four senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of State John Kerry advocating for the United States using &quot;all available tools to dissuade Russia from continuing its airstrikes in Syria that are clearly not in our interest&quot; and saying there should be clear enforcement by the US of the airstrikes violating &quot;a legally binding Security Council Resolution&quot;.

In June 2017, Roberts voted against a resolution by Rand Paul and Chris Murphy that would block President Trump&#x27;s $510million sale of precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia which made up a portion of the $110billion arms sale Trump announced during his visit to Saudi Arabia the previous year.

In March 2018, Roberts voted to table a resolution spearheaded by Bernie Sanders, Chris Murphy, and Mike Lee that would have required President Trump to withdraw American troops either in or influencing Yemen within the next thirty days unless they were combating Al-Qaeda.

In July 2019, Roberts was one of sixteen Republican senators to send a letter to Acting Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russell Vought, Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin encouraging them to work with them to prevent a continuing resolution &quot;for FY 2020 that would delay the implementation of the President&#x27;s National Defense Strategy (NDS) and increase costs&quot; and that the year long continuing resolution suggested by administration officials would render the Defense Department &quot;incapable of increasing readiness, recapitalizing our force, or rationalizing funding to align with the National Defense Strategy (NDS)&quot;.

==Personal life==
Roberts married Franki Fann in 1969. The couple has three adult children: David, Ashleigh, and Anne-Wesley.

Roberts lives in Alexandria, Virginia. &quot;The New York Times&quot; has reported that the house Roberts claims as his residence in Dodge City, Kansas, is actually owned and occupied by campaign contributors C. Duane and Phyllis Ross.

<doc id="363285" wikidata="Q2061290" url="?curid=363285" title="Mame (musical)">
<text>Mame is a musical with a book by Jerome Lawrence and Robert Edwin Lee and music and lyrics by Jerry Herman. Originally titled &quot;My Best Girl&quot;, it is based on the 1955 novel &quot;Auntie Mame&quot; by Patrick Dennis and the 1956 Broadway play of the same name by Lawrence and Lee. A period piece set in New York City and spanning the Great Depression and World War II, it focuses on eccentric bohemian Mame Dennis, whose famous motto is &quot;Life is a banquet and most poor sons of bitches are starving to death.&quot; Her fabulous life with her wealthy friends is interrupted when the young son of her late brother arrives to live with her. They cope with the Depression in a series of adventures.

The musical opened on Broadway in 1966, starring Angela Lansbury and Bea Arthur. The production became a hit and spawned a 1974 film version with Lucille Ball in the title role, and Arthur reprising her supporting role; as well as a London production, a Broadway revival, and a 40th anniversary revival at the Kennedy Center in 2006.

==Background==
The musical was inspired by the success of the 1956 Broadway comedy and subsequent 1958 film version starring Rosalind Russell, as well as the 1955 novel by Patrick Dennis. According to Stephen Citron, in &quot;Jerry Herman: Poet of the Showtune&quot;, the &quot;kudos [for &quot;Auntie Mame&quot;] made all involved immediately think of musicalizing the play.&quot; Dennis wrote several more comic novels, including a sequel, &quot;Around the World with Auntie Mame&quot;, and &quot;Little Me&quot;, which was made into a Broadway musical starring Sid Caesar. The success of that musical may have prompted Lawrence and Lee to turn &quot;Mame&quot; into a musical. 

Rosalind Russell didn’t want the role, Mary Martin backed out after her initial acceptance, and Ethel Merman declined. The producers “heard from—or considered…Eve Arden, Lauren Bacall, Lucille Ball, Kaye Ballard, Constance Bennett, Georgia Brown, Kitty Carlisle, Barbara Cook, Bette Davis, Doris Day, Olivia de Havilland, Phyllis Diller, Irene Dunne, Nanette Fabray, Arlene Francis, Judy Garland, Greer Garson, Mitzi Gaynor, Dolores Gray, Tammy Grimes, Julie Harris, Susan Hayward, Katharine Hepburn, Lena Horne, Lisa Kirk, Margaret Leighton, Beatrice Lillie, Gisele MacKenzie, Jane Morgan, Patrice Munsel, Geraldine Page, Ginger Rogers, Dinah Shore, Simone Signoret, Maggie Smith, Elaine Stritch—and…Angela Lansbury,&quot; who was eventually cast.”

For its second run, Jerry Herman wanted to cast Judy Garland, but that request was denied by the producers of the show, who deemed her a liability.

According to Herman it took six months to write the score.

==Productions==

===Original Broadway===
The musical opened on Broadway at the Winter Garden Theatre on May 24, 1966. Three years later, it transferred to The Broadway Theatre, where it remained until closing on January 3, 1970. Between the two venues, it ran a total of 1,508 performances and five previews. The musical was directed by Gene Saks, choreographed by Onna White with scenic design by William and Jean Eckart, costume design by Robert Mackintosh, lighting design by Tharon Musser and orchestrations by Philip J. Lang. Besides Lansbury as Mame, the cast included Bea Arthur as Vera Charles, Frankie Michaels as Patrick, Jane Connell as Agnes Gooch, Charles Braswell as Beauregard Jackson Pickett Burnside, and Willard Waterman (who had played Claude Upson in the 1958 film) as Dwight Babcock.

Lansbury, Arthur and Michaels all won Tony Awards, while Saks, White, the writers, Herman, and set designers William and Jean Eckart all received nominations.

When Lansbury took a two-week vacation in August 1967, Celeste Holm played the title role, prior to heading the National Tour, and &quot;garnered ecstatic reviews&quot; including from &quot;The New York Times&quot;
When Lansbury left the Broadway production on March 30, 1968, to take the show on a limited US tour, Janis Paige was the star chosen to be the new Broadway Mame, starting in April 1968. Paige&#x27;s run and the show itself continued to be so successful that she was followed by Jane Morgan (December 1968), who was followed by Ann Miller (May 1969).

===US national tours===
Celeste Holm, who played the role on Broadway for two weeks when Lansbury took a vacation, continued in the role in the first national tour. The cast also included Loretta Swit and Wesley Addy. This production toured from August 29, 1967 to June 15, 1968.

When Lansbury left the Broadway production, she led a brief two-stop California tour that played the Curran Theatre in San Francisco from April 30 to June 23, 1968 and the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles from June 25 to August 31. This production starred Anne Francine, who had replaced Arthur on Broadway, and Connell.

A third tour opened in New Haven, Connecticut in January, 1969. It starred Janet Blair as Mame and Elaine Stritch as Vera. This tour closed the following May in Louisville, Kentucky.

A fourth tour opened the following September in Hartford, Connecticut starring Sheila Smith. Patrice Munsel and Anne Russell later led this tour. It closed in June, 1970.

Juliet Prowse lead a fourth tour in 1990, produced by Theatre Under The Stars. Delphi Lawrence reprised her role of Vera from the 1968 Las Vegas production. 

=== Australia ===
The Australian production presented by J. C. Williamson&#x27;s opened at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Melbourne on May 25, 1968, and subsequently played seasons in Adelaide, Perth and Sydney. Gaylea Byrne starred as Mame Dennis, alongside Mary Hardy as Agnes Gooch, Sheila Bradley as Vera Charles and Geoff Hiscock as Beauregard.

=== West End ===
The 1969 West End production starred Ginger Rogers in the title role and Margaret Courtenay as Vera. It ran for a fourteen-month engagement at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane with a special performance for Queen Elizabeth II. Victor Woolf was the stage manager for this production.

===Other productions===
Susan Hayward appeared in the Las Vegas production, while such stars as Ann Sothern, Janet Blair, Jane Russell, Elaine Stritch, Edie Adams, Patrice Munsel, Kitty Carlisle, Carol Lawrence, Shani Wallis, Jo Anne Worley, and Sheila Smith appeared in stock, regional or touring productions.

In 1976, a Mexican production was performed in Mexico City with Silvia Pinal in the title role and Evangelina Elizondo as Vera. In 1985, Pinal reprised the production with the Spanish actress María Rivas as Vera. In 2014/2015, a Mexican new production was performed in Mexico with Itati Cantoral and Alicia Machado in the title role and Dalilah Polanco as Vera.

Despite the presence of Lansbury, a much-heralded Broadway revival was ultimately unsuccessful. After seven previews, it opened on July 24, 1983, at the George Gershwin Theatre, where it ran for only 41 performances.

Juliet Prowse, who in August 1969 subbed for Ginger Rogers in the original West End production of &quot;Mame&quot;, would subsequently reprise the title role in a number of US productions, led off by a 1970 Dallas Summer Musicals production whose cast included Jane Connell as Gooch, Ruth Gillette as Mrs. Burnside/Mrs. Upson, and William LeMassena as Babcock. In the autumn of 1970 Prowse headlined &quot;Mame&quot; at the Westgate Las Vegas (then known as the International Hotel) in a production featuring reprises by Jane Connell and Ruth Gillette, with Upson being played by Connell&#x27;s husband Gordon Connell and Vera played by Anne Francine who had replaced Beatrice Arthur in the original Broadway production: by 1983, which year Francine reprised (briefly) the role on Broadway, Francine had played Vera some 800 times. The Westgate production of &quot;Mame&quot; also featured John McCook as adult Patrick. Prowse resumed headlining &quot;Mame&quot; in a 1989–1990 North American tour whose cast included Meghan Duffy as Gooch, Thomas Hill as Upson, and Delphi Lawrence as Vera. Subsequent to headlining &quot;Mame&quot; at Harrah&#x27;s Lake Tahoe in the summer of 1992, Prowse headlined a production of &quot;Mame&quot; which played the Alex Theatre (Glendale) and also Spreckels Theater (San Diego) in respectively April and May 1994 with a cast which included Franklin Cover as Babcock and Marsha Kramer as Gooch.

In July–August 1991 Mariette Hartley headlined the St. Louis Municipal Opera Theatre production of &quot;Mame&quot; whose cast also included Georgia Engel as Gooch, Alan Muraoka as Ito, and Gretchen Wyler as Vera.

In the mid-90s, a concert staging was done for BBC Radio 4. The cast included Julia McKenzie as Mame, Libby Morris as Vera, Claire Moore as Agnes, Bob Sessions as Mr. Babcock, Jon Lee as Young Patrick, David Kernan as Beauregard, and Robert Meadmore as Older Patrick.

In 1999, The Production Company in Melbourne, Australia staged &quot;Mame&quot; for their very first season, starring Rhonda Burchmore and Pamela Rabe. In 2008, &quot;The Production Company&quot; staged &quot;Mame&quot; once more, in celebration for their tenth anniversary, with Rhonda Burchmore reprising her role.

The Paper Mill Playhouse (Millburn, New Jersey) production of &quot;Mame&quot; in September and October 1999 was headlined by Christine Ebersole and featured Kelly Bishop as Vera and Paul Iacono as Young Patrick. 

The Kennedy Center production ran from June 1, 2006 to July 2, and starred Christine Baranski as Mame, Harriet Sansom Harris as Vera, and Emily Skinner as Gooch.

Michele Lee headlined a single performance production of &quot;Mame&quot; at the Hollywood Bowl on 1 August 2004 whose cast also included Allyce Beasley as Gooch, Ben Platt as Young Patrick, Christine Ebersole as Vera, Jennifer Hall as Gloria, Lauri Johnson doubling as Madame Branislowski and Mrs. Burnside, Edie McClurg as Mrs. Upson, Robert Picardo as Babcock, Alan Thicke as Mr. Upson, John Schneider as Beauregard, and Fred Willard as Woolsey. Lee would subsequently headline the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera production of &quot;Mame&quot; in July 2008, which featured Donna Lynne Champlin as Gooch.

The first UK production of &quot;Mame&quot; in 50 years opened at the Hope Mill Theatre (Manchester) in September 2019, directed by Nick Winston with Tracie Bennett headlining a cast which included Tim Flavin as Beauregard, Harriet Thorpe as Vera, and Pippa Winslow doubling as Sally Cato and Mrs. Upson. With Darren Day replacing Flavin, the production encored at the Royal &amp; Derngate Theatre (Northampton) and Salisbury Playhouse in respectively January and May 2020. The show received seven WhatsOnStage Award nominations.

==Adaptations==
A 1974 film version of the musical starred Lucille Ball as Mame, Bea Arthur reprising her role as Vera Charles, Jane Connell reprising her role as Agnes Gooch and Robert Preston as Beauregard. It was both a US box office failure and a critical disappointment with Ball being considered not up to the musical demands of the title role.

==Synopsis==
The madcap life of eccentric Mame Dennis and her bohemian, intellectual arty clique is disrupted when her deceased brother&#x27;s 10-year-old son Patrick is entrusted to her care. Rather than bow to convention, Mame introduces the boy to her free-wheeling lifestyle, instilling in him her favorite credo, &quot;Life is a banquet, and most poor sons of bitches are starving to death.&quot; Figuring in the storyline are Agnes Gooch (Mame&#x27;s personal secretary and nanny-in-law), Vera Charles (her &quot;bosom buddy&quot; baritone actress and world&#x27;s greatest lush) and Dwight Babcock (the stuffy and officious executor of her brother&#x27;s estate). Mame loses her fortune in the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and tries her hand at a number of jobs with comically disastrous results but perseveres with good humor and an irrepressible sense of style.

Mame then meets and marries Beauregard Jackson Pickett Burnside, a Southern aristocrat with a Georgia plantation called Peckerwood. The trustees of Patrick&#x27;s father force Mame to send Patrick off to boarding school (the fictional St Boniface, in Massachusetts), and Mame and Beau travel the world on an endless honeymoon that stops when Beau falls to his death while mountain climbing. Mame returns home a wealthy widow to discover that Patrick has become a snob engaged to an equally priggish debutante, Gloria Upson, from a bigoted family. Mame brings Patrick to his senses just in time to introduce him to the woman who will eventually become his wife, Pegeen Ryan. As the story ends, Mame is preparing to take Patrick&#x27;s young son, Peter, to India with her usual flair.

===Recording===
A cast recording of the Broadway production was released on the Columbia Masterworks label in 1966. 
 A CD version, with five bonus tracks, was released by Legacy Recordings in 1999. The bonus tracks include demo versions of &quot;St. Bridget&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Today&quot;, &quot;Open a New Window&quot;, and &quot;Mame&quot;, as well as the song &quot;Camouflage&quot; (intended to be sung between Mame Dennis and Vera Charles prior to the discussion of whether Patrick could stay with Mame), all performed by Jerry Herman and Alice Borden. (Another cut song, &quot;Love is only Love&quot;, was to be sung by Mame to Patrick before &quot;The Fox Hunt&quot;; it was later used in the movie version of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;.)

In 1966, Bobby Darin, Louis Armstrong, and Herb Alpert all charted in the United States and Canada with their cover records of the musical&#x27;s title song. Eydie Gormé had a huge success with her recording of &quot;If He Walked into My Life&quot;, for which she received a 1967 Grammy Award for Best Female Vocal Performance. &quot;We Need a Little Christmas&quot; is a well known holiday tune and can be heard in several Disney Christmas parades.

<text>In population ecology and economics, maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is theoretically, the largest yield (or catch) that can be taken from a species&#x27; stock over an indefinite period. Fundamental to the notion of sustainable harvest, the concept of MSY aims to maintain the population size at the point of maximum growth rate by harvesting the individuals that would normally be added to the population, allowing the population to continue to be productive indefinitely. Under the assumption of logistic growth, resource limitation does not constrain individuals&#x27; reproductive rates when populations are small, but because there are few individuals, the overall yield is small. At intermediate population densities, also represented by half the carrying capacity, individuals are able to breed to their maximum rate. At this point, called the maximum sustainable yield, there is a surplus of individuals that can be harvested because growth of the population is at its maximum point due to the large number of reproducing individuals. Above this point, density dependent factors increasingly limit breeding until the population reaches carrying capacity. At this point, there are no surplus individuals to be harvested and yield drops to zero. The maximum sustainable yield is usually higher than the optimum sustainable yield and maximum economic yield.

MSY is extensively used for fisheries management. Unlike the logistic (Schaefer) model, MSY has been refined in most modern fisheries models and occurs at around 30% of the unexploited population size. This fraction differs among populations depending on the life history of the species and the age-specific selectivity of the fishing method.

==History==
The concept of MSY as a fisheries management strategy developed in Belmar, New Jersey, in the early 1930s. It increased in popularity in the 1950s with the advent of surplus-production models with explicitly estimate MSY. As an apparently simple and logical management goal, combined with the lack of other simple management goals of the time, MSY was adopted as the primary management goal by several international organizations (e.g., IWC, IATTC, ICCAT, ICNAF), and individual countries.

Between 1949 and 1955, the U.S. maneuvered to have MSY declared the goal of international fisheries management (Johnson 2007). The international MSY treaty that was eventually adopted in 1955 gave foreign fleets the right to fish off any coast. Nations that wanted to exclude foreign boats had to first prove that its fish were overfished.

As experience was gained with the model, it became apparent to some researchers that it lacked the capability to deal with the real world operational complexities and the influence of trophic and other interactions. In 1977, Peter Larkin wrote its epitaph, challenging the goal of maximum sustained yield on several grounds: It put populations at too much risk; it did not account for spatial variability in productivity; it did not account for species other than the focus of the fishery; it considered only the benefits, not the costs, of fishing; and it was sensitive to political pressure. In fact, none of these criticisms was aimed at sustainability as a goal. The first one noted that seeking the absolute MSY with uncertain parameters was risky. The rest point out that the goal of MSY was not holistic; it left out too many relevant features.

Some managers began to use more conservative quota recommendations, but the influence of the MSY model for fisheries management still prevailed. Even while the scientific community was beginning to question the appropriateness and effectiveness of MSY as a management goal, it was incorporated into the 1982 United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea, thus ensuring its integration into national and international fisheries acts and laws.

== Modelling MSY ==

=== Population growth ===
The key assumption behind all sustainable harvesting models such as MSY is that populations of organisms grow and replace themselves – that is, they are renewable resources. Additionally it is assumed that because the growth rates, survival rates, and reproductive rates increase when harvesting reduces population density, they produce a surplus of biomass that can be harvested. Otherwise, sustainable harvest would not be possible.

Another assumption of renewable resource harvesting is that populations of organisms do not continue to grow indefinitely; they reach an equilibrium population size, which occurs when the number of individuals matches the resources available to the population (i.e., assume classic logistic growth). At this equilibrium population size, called the carrying capacity, the population remains at a stable size.

The logistic model (or logistic function) is a function that is used to describe bounded population growth under the previous two assumptions. The logistic function is bounded at both extremes: when there are not individuals to reproduce, and when there is an equilibrium number of individuals (i.e., at carrying capacity). Under the logistic model, population growth rate between these two limits is most often assumed to be sigmoidal (Figure 1). There is scientific evidence that some populations do grow in a logistic fashion towards a stable equilibrium – a commonly cited example is the logistic growth of yeast.

The equation describing logistic growth is:

:: formula_1 (equation 1.1)

The parameter values are:
:: formula_2=The population size at time t

:: formula_3=The carrying capacity of the population

:: formula_4= The population size at time zero

:: formula_5= the intrinsic rate of population increase (the rate at which the population grows when it is very small)

From the logistic function, the population size at any point can be calculated as long as formula_5, formula_3, and formula_4 are known.

Differentiating equation 1.1 give an expression for how the rate of population increases as N increases. At first, the population growth rate is fast, but it begins to slow as the population grows until it levels off to the maximum growth rate, after which it begins to decrease (figure 2).

The equation for figure 2 is the differential of equation 1.1 (Verhulst&#x27;s 1838 growth model):

::formula_9 (equation 1.2)

formula_10 can be understood as the change in population (N) with respect to a change in time (t). Equation 1.2 is the usual way in which logistic growth is represented mathematically and has several important features. First, at very low population sizes, the value of formula_11 is small, so the population growth rate is approximately equal to formula_12, meaning the population is growing exponentially at a rate r (the intrinsic rate of population increase). Despite this, the population growth rate is very low (low values on the y-axis of figure 2) because, even though each individual is reproducing at a high rate, there are few reproducing individuals present. Conversely, when the population is large the value of formula_11 approaches 1 effectively reducing the terms inside the brackets of equation 1.2 to zero. The effect is that the population growth rate is again very low, because either each individual is hardly reproducing or mortality rates are high. As a result of these two extremes, the population growth rate is maximum at an intermediate population or half the carrying capacity (formula_14).

=== MSY model ===

The simplest way to model harvesting is to modify the logistic equation so that a certain number of individuals is continuously removed:

:: formula_15 (equation 1.3)

Where H represents the number of individuals being removed from the population – that is, the harvesting rate. When H is constant, the population will be at equilibrium when the number of individuals being removed is equal to the population growth rate (figure 3). The equilibrium population size under a particular harvesting regime can be found when the population is not growing – that is, when formula_16. This occurs when the population growth rate is the same as the harvest rate:

:: formula_17

Figure 3 shows how growth rate varies with population density. For low densities (far from carrying capacity), there is little addition (or &quot;recruitment&quot;) to the population, simply because there are few organisms to give birth. At high densities, though, there is intense competition for resources, and growth rate is again low because the death rate is high. In between these two extremes, the population growth rate rises to a maximum value (formula_18). This maximum point represents the maximum number of individuals that can be added to a population by natural processes. If more individuals than this are removed from the population, the population is at risk for decline to extinction. The maximum number that can be harvested in a sustainable manner, called the maximum sustainable yield, is given by this maximum point.

Figure 3 also shows several possible values for the harvesting rate, H. At formula_19, there are two possible population equilibrium points: a low population size (formula_20) and a high one (formula_21). At formula_22, a slightly higher harvest rate, however there is only one equilibrium point (at formula_18), which is the population size that produces the maximum growth rate. With logistic growth, this point, called the maximum sustainable yield, is where the population size is half the carrying capacity (or formula_24). The maximum sustainable yield is the largest yield that can be taken from a population at equilibrium.
In figure 3, if formula_25 is higher than formula_22, the harvesting would exceed the population&#x27;s capacity to replace itself at any population size (formula_27 in figure 3). Because harvesting rate is higher than the population growth rate at all values of formula_28, this rate of harvesting is not sustainable.

An important feature of the MSY model is how harvested populations respond to environmental fluctuations or illegal offtake. Consider a population at formula_21 harvested at a constant harvest level formula_19. If the population falls (due to a bad winter or illegal harvest) this will ease density-dependent population regulation and increase yield, moving the population back to formula_21, a stable equilibrium. In this case, a negative feedback loop creates stability. The lower equilibrium point for the constant harvest level formula_19 is not stable however; a population crash or illegal harvesting will decrease population yield farther below the current harvest level, creating a positive feedback loop leading to extinction. Harvesting at formula_33 is also potentially unstable. A small decrease in the population can lead to a positive feedback loop and extinction if the harvesting regime (formula_22) is not reduced. Thus, some consider harvesting at MSY to be unsafe on ecological and economic grounds. The MSY model itself can be modified to harvest a certain percentage of the population or with constant effort constraints rather than an actual number, thereby avoiding some of its instabilities.

The MSY equilibrium point is semi-stable – a small increase in population size is compensated for, a small decrease to extinction if H is not decreased. Harvesting at MSY is therefore dangerous because it is on a knife-edge – any small population decline leads to a positive feedback, with the population declining rapidly to extinction if the number of harvested stays the same.

The formula for maximum sustained harvest (formula_25) is one-fourth the maximum population or carrying capacity (formula_36) times the intrinsic rate of growth (formula_37).

=== For demographically structured populations ===
The principle of MSY often holds for age-structured populations as well. The calculations can be more complicated, and the results often depend on whether density dependence occurs in the larval stage (often modeled as density dependent reproduction) and/or other life stages. It has been shown that if density dependence only acts on larva, then there is an optimal life stage (size or age class) to harvest, with no harvest of all other life stages. Hence the optimal strategy is to harvest this most valuable life-stage at MSY. However, in age and stage-structured models, a constant MSY does not always exist. In such cases, cyclic harvest is optimal where the yield and resource fluctuate in size, through time. In addition, environmental stochasticity interacts with demographically structured populations in fundamentally different ways than for unstructured populations when determining optimal harvest. In fact, the optimal biomass to be left in the ocean, when fished at MSY, can be either higher or lower than in analogous deterministic models, depending on the details of the density dependent recruitment function, if stage-structure is also included in the model.

=== Implications of MSY model ===
Starting to harvest a previously unharvested population will always lead to a decrease in the population size. That is, it is impossible for a harvested population to remain at its original carrying capacity. Instead, the population will either stabilize at a new lower equilibrium size or, if the harvesting rate is too high, decline to zero.

The reason why populations can be sustainably harvested is that they exhibit a density-dependent response. This means that at any population size below K, the population is producing a surplus yield that is available for harvesting without reducing population size. Density dependence is the regulator process that allows the population to return to equilibrium after a perturbation. The logistic equation assumes that density dependence takes the form of negative feedback.

If a constant number of individuals is harvested from a population at a level greater than the MSY, the population will decline to extinction. Harvesting below the MSY level leads to a stable equilibrium population if the starting population is above the unstable equilibrium population size.

=== Uses of MSY ===
MSY has been especially influential in the management of renewable biological resources such as commercially important fish and wildlife. In fisheries terms, maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is the largest average catch that can be captured from a stock under existing environmental conditions. MSY aims at a balance between too much and too little harvest to keep the population at some intermediate abundance with a maximum replacement rate.

Relating to MSY, the maximum economic yield (MEY) is the level of catch that provides the maximum net economic benefits or profits to society. Like optimum sustainable yield, MEY is usually less than MSY.

=== Limitations of MSY approach ===
Although it is widely practiced by state and federal government agencies regulating wildlife, forests, and fishing, MSY has come under heavy criticism by ecologists and others from both theoretical and practical reasons. The concept of maximum sustainable yield is not always easy to apply in practice. Estimation problems arise due to poor assumptions in some models and lack of reliability of the data. Biologists, for example, do not always have enough data to make a clear determination of the population&#x27;s size and growth rate. Calculating the point at which a population begins to slow from competition is also very difficult. The concept of MSY also tends to treat all individuals in the population as identical, thereby ignoring all aspects of population structure such as size or age classes and their differential rates of growth, survival, and reproduction.

As a management goal, the static interpretation of MSY (i.e., MSY as a fixed catch that can be taken year after year) is generally not appropriate because it ignores the fact that fish populations undergo natural fluctuations (i.e., MSY treats the environment as unvarying) in abundance and will usually ultimately become severely depleted under a constant-catch strategy. Thus, most fisheries scientists now interpret MSY in a more dynamic sense as the maximum average yield (MAY) obtained by applying a specific harvesting strategy to a fluctuating resource. Or as an optimal &quot;escapement strategy&quot;, where escapement means the amount of fish that must remain in the ocean [rather than the amount of fish that can be harvested]. An escapement strategy is often the optimal strategy for maximizing expected yield of a harvested, stochastically fluctuating population.

However, the limitations of MSY, does not mean it performs worse than humans using their best intuitive judgment. Experiments using students in natural resource management classes suggest that people using their past experience, intuition, and best judgement to manage a fishery generate far less long term yield compared to a computer using an MSY calculation, even when that calculation comes from incorrect population dynamic models.

For a more contemporary description of MSY and its calculation see 

==== Orange roughy ====

An example of errors in estimating the population dynamics of a species occurred within the New Zealand Orange roughy fishery. Early quotas were based on an assumption that the orange roughy had a fairly short lifespan and bred relatively quickly. However, it was later discovered that the orange roughy lived a long time and had bred slowly (~30 years). By this stage stocks had been largely depleted.

== Criticism ==

The approach has been widely criticized as ignoring several key factors involved in fisheries management and has led to the devastating collapse of many fisheries. Among conservation biologists it is widely regarded as dangerous and misused.

== Overfishing ==

Across the world there is a crisis in the world&#x27;s fisheries. In recent years an accelerating decline has been observed in the productivity of many important fisheries. Fisheries which have been devastated in recent times include (but are not limited to) the great whale fisheries, the Grand Bank fisheries of the western Atlantic, and the Peruvian anchovy fishery. Recent assessments by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the state of the world&#x27;s fisheries indicate a levelling off of landings in the 1990s, at about 100 million tons.

In addition, the composition of global catches has changed. As fishers deplete larger, long-lived predatory fish species such as cod, tuna, shark, and snapper, they move down to the next level – to species that tend to be smaller, shorter-lived, and less valuable.

Overfishing is a classic example of the tragedy of the commons.

== Optimum sustainable yield ==

In population ecology and economics, optimum sustainable yield is the level of effort (LOE) that maximizes the difference between total revenue and total cost. Or, where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. This level of effort maximizes the economic profit, or rent, of the resource being utilized. It usually corresponds to an effort level lower than that of maximum sustainable yield.
In environmental science, optimum sustainable yield is the largest economical yield of a renewable resource achievable over a long time period without decreasing the ability of the population or its environment to support the continuation of this level of yield.

<doc id="363292" wikidata="Q1363468" url="?curid=363292" title="Mike DeWine">
<text>Richard Michael DeWine ( ; born January 5, 1947) is an American politician and attorney serving as the 70th governor of Ohio since 2019. A member of the Republican Party, he served as the 50th attorney general of Ohio from 2011 to 2019, in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1983 to 1991, and in the U.S. Senate from 1995 to 2007.

DeWine is a native of Yellow Springs, Ohio. He graduated from Miami University with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1969 and earned a Juris Doctor from Ohio Northern University College of Law in 1972. After graduation, DeWine worked as an assistant prosecutor for Greene County and was elected county prosecutor, serving one term. He continued his political career in the Ohio Senate in 1980. He served as a U.S. representative from 1983 until 1991. In 1991, he was sworn in as the 59th lieutenant governor of Ohio, under George Voinovich.

DeWine was elected to the United States Senate in a landslide in the 1994 Republican Revolution. He served in the Senate until his defeat by Sherrod Brown in 2006. DeWine returned to politics four years later and became the 50th attorney general of Ohio, serving from 2011 to 2019. He was elected governor in 2018. During DeWine&#x27;s first term as governor, a shooting in Dayton prompted him to urge the Ohio legislature to enact new gun control measures, such as expanding background checks and harsher penalties for those in possession of unregistered firearms. In early 2020, DeWine received national attention for his COVID-19 response, ordering the closing of dine-in restaurant service and sporting events and delegating additional resources to elderly care facilities. He was reelected by a landslide 25% margin against Democratic nominee Nan Whaley, the former mayor of Dayton, in 2022.

==Early life and education==
DeWine was born in Springfield, Ohio, on January 5, 1947, and grew up in nearby Yellow Springs, Ohio. He is the son of Jean Ruth ( Liddle) and Richard Lee DeWine. He was raised and identifies as a Roman Catholic. DeWine earned his Bachelor of Science degree in education from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, in 1969 and a Juris Doctor from Ohio Northern University College of Law in 1972.

==Early political career==

At age 25, DeWine started working as an assistant prosecuting attorney for Greene County, Ohio, and in 1976 was elected County Prosecutor, serving for four years. In 1980, he was elected to the Ohio State Senate and served one two-year term.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
In 1982, U.S. representative Bud Brown of Ohio&#x27;s 7th congressional district retired after 18 years in Congress; his father, Clarence Brown, Sr., had held the seat for 26 years before that. DeWine won the Republican nomination, assuring his election in November. He was reelected three more times from this district, which stretches from his home in Springfield to the Columbus suburbs. He ran unopposed in 1986 in what was regarded as a bad year for Republicans nationally.

In 1986, DeWine was one of the House impeachment managers who prosecuted the case in the impeachment trial of Judge Harry E. Claiborne. Claiborne was found guilty by the United States Senate and removed from his federal judgeship.

==Lieutenant Governor of Ohio and unsuccessful run for U.S. Senate==
DeWine did not seek reelection to the House of Representatives in 1990, and briefly ran for governor, but withdrew before the primaries and instead ran for lieutenant governor as George Voinovich&#x27;s running mate in that year&#x27;s Ohio gubernatorial election. The Voinovich-DeWine ticket was easily elected.

In 1992, DeWine unsuccessfully ran for United States Senate against the former astronaut and incumbent senator John Glenn. His campaign used the phrase, &quot;What &quot;on earth&quot; has John Glenn done?&quot;, echoing Jeff Bingaman&#x27;s slogan &quot;What on Earth has he done for you lately?&quot; against former astronaut Harrison Schmitt in their 1982 Senate race.

==U.S. Senate==
In 1994, DeWine ran again for Senate, defeating prominent attorney Joel Hyatt (the son-in-law of retiring Senator Howard Metzenbaum) by a 14-point margin. DeWine was reelected in 2000, defeating gunshow promoter Ronald Dickson (161,185 votes, or 12.44%) and former U.S. representative Frank Cremeans (104,219 votes, or 8.05%) in the primary and Ted Celeste (brother of former Ohio governor Dick Celeste) in the general election. DeWine sat on the Senate Judiciary and Select Intelligence committees. He was the initial sponsor of the Drug-Free Century Act in 1999 and was a member of the Gang of 14, a bipartisan group of senators that in 2005 made a compromise on judicial nominees. He voted in favor of the 2002 Iraq Resolution authorizing the use of force against Saddam Hussein.

In the 2006 United States Senate election in Ohio, DeWine ran for reelection but lost to U.S. representative and former Ohio secretary of state Sherrod Brown by 496,332 votes. He received 905,644 fewer votes in 2006 than he received in 2000.

==Out of government (2007–11)==
DeWine accepted positions teaching government courses at Cedarville University, Ohio Northern University and Miami University. In 2007, he joined the law firm Keating Muething &amp; Klekamp as corporate investigations group co-chair. He also advised the Ohio campaign of John McCain&#x27;s 2008 presidential bid.

==Attorney General of Ohio==

On July 21, 2009, DeWine announced candidacy for attorney general of the State of Ohio. On November 2, 2010, he was elected attorney general, defeating incumbent Richard Cordray, 48% to 46%. As attorney general of Ohio, DeWine sent letters to drugstore chains encouraging them to discontinue the sale of tobacco products.

In the 2012 Republican presidential primary, DeWine endorsed Tim Pawlenty, then endorsed Mitt Romney after Pawlenty dropped out of the race. On February 17, 2012, DeWine announced he was retracting his endorsement of Romney and endorsed Rick Santorum. DeWine said, &quot;To be elected president, you have to do more than tear down your opponents. You have to give the American people a reason to vote for you, a reason to hope, a reason to believe that under your leadership, America will be better. Rick Santorum has done that. Sadly, Governor Romney has not.&quot;

On November 4, 2014, DeWine was reelected as attorney general, defeating challenger David A. Pepper. He carried 83 of Ohio&#x27;s 88 counties.

===Legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act===
In 2015, DeWine filed a lawsuit in federal court in Ohio against a part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). In the suit, he alleged that the ACA&#x27;s Transitional Reinsurance Program (which imposed a fee &quot;paid by all employers who provide group health insurance in the workplace&quot;, which in 2014 was $63 per covered person and in 2015 was $44 per covered person) was unconstitutional as applied to state and local governments. When he filed the suit, DeWine claimed that the fee was &quot;an unprecedented attempt to destroy the balance of authority between the federal government and the states&quot;.

In January 2016, the federal court dismissed DeWine&#x27;s suit, with U.S. district judge Algenon L. Marbley holding that the Transitional Reinsurance Program did not violate the Constitution. DeWine appealed, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed Marbley&#x27;s dismissal of the suit.

===Criminal justice===
DeWine&#x27;s stated goal has been &quot;Protecting Ohio Families&quot;. To that effect, he made it a priority to significantly reduce DNA testing turnaround times in connection with open criminal investigations. Under his predecessor, DNA testing at the Ohio attorney general&#x27;s Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI) took approximately four months in cases such as murders, rapes, and assaults. Under the DeWine administration, DNA test results are now returned to local law enforcement in less than a month, leading to faster apprehension of dangerous suspects.

Upon taking office in 2011, DeWine launched a special sexual assault kit (SAK) testing initiative after learning that hundreds of police departments across Ohio had thousands of untested rape kits on their evidence room shelves. DeWine invested resources to test the 13,931 previously untested rape kits over the course of his administration, which led to more than 5,000 DNA hits in the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS). These DNA matches led to the indictments of approximately 700 alleged rapists, many of whom were serial attackers, connected to cases that would never have been solved if not for the DeWine initiative.

DeWine also launched the Crimes Against Children Initiative, which paired BCI criminal investigators with seasoned prosecuting attorneys to investigate and prosecute child predators. The Crimes Against Children Initiative focuses on holding accountable those who sexually and physically abuse children, those who share and view child pornography, and those who target children online. DeWine&#x27;s office also developed several task forces for the investigation and prosecutions of human trafficking throughout the state.

===Opioids===
As attorney general, DeWine took steps to close down &quot;pill mills&quot; in Ohio that fueled the opioid epidemic. By the end of his first year in office, he had worked to close all 12 pill mills in Scioto County, considered by many to have been the national center of the prescription drug crisis. DeWine&#x27;s efforts also led to more than 100 doctors and pharmacists losing their licenses for improper prescription practices. In 2013, DeWine formed a new Heroin Unit to provide Ohio communities with law enforcement, legal, and outreach assistance to combat the state&#x27;s heroin problem. The Heroin Unit draws from new and existing office resources, including BCI investigative and laboratory services, Ohio Organized Crime Investigations Commission assistance, prosecutorial support, and outreach and education services. In October 2017, DeWine announced a 12-pronged plan to combat the opioid epidemic, drawing from his experience breaking up pill mills, prosecuting traffickers, supporting recovery, and advocating the importance of drug-use prevention education. In addition, he went after the pharmaceutical industry, suing opioid manufacturers and distributors for their alleged roles in fraudulent marketing and unsafe distribution of opioids that fueled the epidemic in Ohio and across the country.

===Columbus Crew relocation lawsuit===
In October 2017, news reports surfaced that Anthony Precourt, the investor-operator of the soccer club Columbus Crew, was exploring the option of moving the team out of state. After the Cleveland Browns moved to Baltimore in the late 1990s, the Ohio General Assembly passed a law requiring professional sports teams that had accepted taxpayer assistance to provide an opportunity for local owners to purchase the team before initiating a move. In December 2017, DeWine sent a letter to Precourt reminding him of his obligations under Ohio law. After Precourt failed to respond, DeWine filed suit against Precourt and Major League Soccer in March 2018 to enforce Ohio law and insist upon a reasonable opportunity for local investors to buy the team. As the lawsuit played out, an investor group including Dee and Jimmy Haslam, owners of the Cleveland Browns, and the Columbus-based Edwards family announced in October 2018 they were working out the details of a deal to keep the Crew in Columbus.

==Governor of Ohio==
===2018 election===


On May 26, 2016, DeWine announced his candidacy for governor of Ohio in 2018. He confirmed this on June 25, 2017, at the annual ice cream social held at his home in Cedarville, Ohio. On December 1, 2017, DeWine chose Ohio secretary of state Jon Husted as his running mate. On May 8, 2018, he won the Republican primary, defeating incumbent lieutenant governor Mary Taylor with 59.8% of the vote. He defeated the Democratic nominee, former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director Richard Cordray in the general election, by a margin of about four percentage points.

===Tenure===
====2019====
On February 22, 2019, President Trump appointed DeWine to the bipartisan Council of Governors.

On August 4, 2019, a mass shooting occurred in Dayton, Ohio, that killed ten people and injured 27 others; this followed a mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, by just 13 hours. At a vigil for the victims of the Dayton shooting the next day, DeWine was drowned out by a crowd chanting &quot;Do something!&quot;; the chant referred to the lack of legislative gun control actions on the state and federal level. On August 6, DeWine proposed to allow judges to confiscate firearms from those deemed potentially dangerous and to provide them with mental health treatment while maintaining their due process rights. Other notable aspects of DeWine&#x27;s plan include expanded background checks before purchasing a firearm, increased access to psychiatric and behavioral health services, and increased penalties for illegally possessing firearms.

In October 2019, DeWine held the first meeting of a Lead Advisory Committee he appointed for the state. The committee is meant to advise him on the state&#x27;s lead remediation efforts. In December 2019, he expressed his support for Ohio allowing cities to ban plastic bags, opposing two bills in the state legislature that would have forbidden it being pushed by fellow Republicans.

On December 10, 2019, during the Ohio Contractors Association&#x27;s winter conference in Columbus, DeWine said that he wanted to improve the Interstate rest areas in Ohio by adding more information about Ohio&#x27;s history and culture. He also said, &quot;I&#x27;m told that our rest areas are sorry.&quot; In late December, DeWine announced that Ohio would continue to accept refugees. In a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, he wrote, &quot;Before entering the United States, there is a lengthy, complex, and careful vetting process done by multiple federal agencies to confirm a refugee&#x27;s eligibility for entrance.&quot;

====2020====
In January 2020, DeWine sent troops from the Ohio National Guard to Puerto Rico, which had recently experienced several earthquakes. On January 15, he signed a $30 million funding bill for Ohio farmers to prevent algal blooms, which went into effect on February 1. On January 27, DeWine signed Senate Bill 7, which gives military members and their spouses better employment opportunities by simplifying the process to transfer their occupational licenses to Ohio. In February 2020, he announced new distracted driving legislation he was sponsoring. Also in February 2020, he attracted attention for declining to share his opinion about Ohio&#x27;s death penalty, at the time having &quot;frozen all Ohio executions indefinitely as the state struggles to find lethal-injection drugs&quot;.

Informed of the public risk by Ohio Department of Health director Amy Acton, on March 3, DeWine canceled most of the Arnold Sports Festival due to the imminent threat of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ohio, before any cases or deaths were reported. The cancellation was widely regarded as &quot;radical&quot; at the time but was soon seen as less so, with &quot;Axios&quot; calling DeWine &quot;among the leading governors in the country sounding the alarm about the threat of the coronavirus&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; calling his and Acton&#x27;s response &quot;a national guide to the crisis&quot; and &quot;textbook recommendations&quot;, pointing out numerous occasions when moves Ohio made were soon duplicated by other states. &quot;The Hill&quot; said DeWine had &quot;been one of the most aggressive governors in responding to the pandemic&quot;. He has supported funding for COVID-19, signing his support of a funding bill along with 37 other governors in March 2020. On March 11, 2020, DeWine issued an order limiting visitors to Ohio assisted living facilities and nursing homes, limiting visitors to one per day per resident, with all visitors to be screened for illness. Also on March 11, he announced he was drafting legislation to limit mass gatherings in the state. DeWine barred spectators from sporting events; was first in the U.S. to shut down schools throughout his state; and, on the night before it was to take place, postponed Ohio&#x27;s primary election. He directed the Ohio Department of Health to order the closing of the state&#x27;s more than 22,000 food service locations and bars, except for carry-out. This was one of the earliest state closures of restaurants in response to the pandemic and drew disapproval from many high-level state Republicans. On April 1, the &quot;BBC&quot; called DeWine &quot;quick to defer to Dr Acton for specific questions on the virus and its spread&quot; during daily news briefings, &quot;reminding Ohioans that the state&#x27;s decisions are driven by science&quot;.

====2022====
During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, DeWine voiced support for Ukraine, saying that the invasion was &quot;unacceptable, and all freedom-loving people should stand against this unprovoked invasion”. On February 26, he took action in support of Ukraine by banning the purchase and sale of Russian Standard vodka within the state of Ohio because the brand and distilleries are owned by a Russian corporation. Retailers were asked to &quot;immediately pull Green Mark Vodka&quot; (an alternate variety of Russian Standard) &quot;and Russian Standard Vodka from their shelves&quot;. On the same day, DeWine declared February 27, 2022, a &quot;Day of Prayer for the People of Ukraine&quot;. On March 8, he directed the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services to convene with resettlement agencies, faith-based organizations, and charities, in a summit to plan for possible resettlement of displaced Ukrainian citizens within Ohio. This summit occurred on March 17.

==Political positions==
===Abortion===

In April 2019, DeWine signed House Bill 493, known as the Ohio &quot;Heartbeat Bill&quot;, into law, prohibiting abortion after a heartbeat is detected in a fetus, with no exceptions for cases of rape and incest, imposing one of the nation&#x27;s most extensive abortion restrictions. DeWine opposes abortion. In the Senate, he was the lead sponsor of the Unborn Victims of Violence Act and voted for the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2003. In December 2020, DeWine signed a bill that said &quot;fetal remains from surgical abortions in Ohio must be cremated or buried&quot;; failure to do so would be a misdemeanor of the first degree.

===Capital punishment===
Although Catholic, DeWine has not joined the Pope and Catholic bishops in opposing the death penalty. Nor has he joined former governor Robert Taft, former attorney general Petro, and former House speaker Householder in calling for an end to Ohio executions. Yet no executions have been conducted in Ohio since DeWine took office, and he has delayed executions due to &quot;ongoing problems involving the willingness of pharmaceutical suppliers to provide drugs to the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction&quot;.

===Gerrymandering===
In 2021, DeWine signed a redistricting map that favored Republicans. The map gave Republicans an advantage in 12 out of 15 districts, leaving two safely Democratic districts and one toss-up district. The map passed the Ohio legislature without any support from Democrats. Voting rights advocates called on DeWine to veto the pro-Republican redistricting map. In 2018, Ohio voted in a referendum for anti-gerrymandering reform that encouraged bipartisan support for redistricting maps. The same year, DeWine pledged to honor the voters&#x27; wishes and support a redistricting process conducted in a bipartisan way, but in 2021 he approved the changes for 2022 onward.

===Gun control===

In Congress, DeWine was known for his support for gun control measures. In 2004, he cosponsored an amendment to renew the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. He has repeatedly received an &quot;F&quot; rating from the National Rifle Association. The National Rifle Association endorsed him for governor. DeWine was one of only two Republican senators to vote against the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which banned lawsuits against gun manufacturers, distributors and dealers for criminal misuse of their products. In the 2006 election cycle, DeWine was the first senatorial candidate to be endorsed by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence; he displayed the endorsement on his campaign webpage. In 2019, DeWine proposed a red flag law for Ohio that would allow courts to take guns from people seen as a threats to others or themselves. In January 2021, he signed into law a bill that removed the requirement to attempt to retreat before shooting in self-defense, and in March 2022 he signed a bill into law removing the requirement to possess a license to carry a concealed handgun in public.

===Highway safety===
As U.S. senator, DeWine joined a bipartisan effort to lower the national maximum blood-alcohol limit from .1% to .08% and to require reporting of vehicle-related deaths on private property like parking lots and driveways. He sponsored legislation on determining when aging tires become unsafe.

===LGBTQ+ rights===
DeWine opposes same-sex marriage and sponsored the Federal Marriage Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which would have prevented same-sex marriage. He argued in the Supreme Court in favor of prohibitions on same-sex marriage, saying that same-sex marriage bans infringe on &quot;no fundamental right&quot; and that states should not have to recognize same-sex couples who married in other states. DeWine was acting as attorney general against Jim Obergefell in the case &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;. The Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling against DeWine and other defendants, finding same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional.

In 2021, DeWine opposed a bill that would have banned transgender athletes from playing on sports teams that do not match their sex at birth, saying, &quot;This issue is best addressed outside of government, through individual sports leagues and athletic associations, including the Ohio High School Athletic Association, who can tailor policies to meet the needs of their member athletes and member institutions.&quot; In December 2023, he vetoed a bill that would have banned minors from receiving gender-affirming care in Ohio and transgender youth from playing on sports teams that did not match their sex assigned at birth. He said that if the bill became law, &quot;Ohio would be saying that the state—that the government knows better what is medically best for a child than the two people who love that child the most, their parents.&quot; In January 2024, the Republican-dominated legislature overrode DeWine&#x27;s veto of the gender-affirming care ban. Also in January 2024, DeWine signed an executive order that restricted gender-affirming surgery for youth while also proposing new administrative rules focused on transgender youth and adults. In February 2024, after backlash from trans people and healthcare providers, DeWine&#x27;s administration dropped all the proposed rules to restrict treatment for transgender adults. In November 2024, DeWine signed into law a bill prohibiting students in public schools from using restrooms other than those for the gender they were assigned at birth.

===Marijuana===
In 2019, DeWine said: &quot;it would really be a mistake for Ohio, by legislation, to say that marijuana for adults is just OK.&quot; In February 2020, NORML, a group advocating the legalization of marijuana, gave DeWine an &quot;F&quot; rating in relation to his policies. He opposed 2023 Ohio Issue 2, the &quot;Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol initiative&quot;. In 2024, DeWine requested lawmakers take action against Delta 8.

=== Hamas-Israel war campus protests ===
After the April 25, 2024, Ohio State University Gaza Solidarity Encampment resulted in at least 36 arrests of pro-Palestinian demonstrators, including 16 Ohio State University students, DeWine said, &quot;I think that Ohio State did well&quot;, &quot;what we don&#x27;t want is any kind of hate&quot;, and that he opposes protests &quot;right outside the door of a classroom&quot;. The demonstrators at the encampment were on the South Oval, which is not in the vicinity of any classrooms. DeWine also said he supported the arrests at Ohio State in the form of Ohio State Highway Patrol, which included an officer who aimed a rifle at protesters during the encampment&#x27;s dispersal. He said that he supports Ohio and the U.S. &quot;backing the country of Israel&quot;. In the same interview, he expressed support for Ohio Revised Code Section 9.76, which legally prohibits Ohio State from boycotting or divesting from companies on the basis of their support for Israel.

===Other===
In 2020, DeWine signed a bill that forbids colleges and universities in Ohio blocking controversial speakers. The same year, DeWine&#x27;s compensation was 17th among state governors, at $159,189, compared to a maximum of $225,000 for the governor of New York and a minimum of $70,000 for the governor of Maine. The Ohio Checkbook shows that 92 employees of the Ohio state teachers retirement system, including director William Neville, equal or exceed the governor&#x27;s salary.

==Personal life==
DeWine lives in the Whitelaw Reid House. He married Frances Struewing on June 3, 1967, and they have had eight children together. Their daughter Rebecca died at the age of 22 on August 4, 1993, in a car accident. One of their sons, Pat DeWine, is an Ohio Supreme Court Justice. Another son, Brian, is the president of the Minor League Baseball team the Asheville Tourists; the DeWine family purchased the team in 2010. DeWine&#x27;s second cousin, Kevin DeWine, is the former Ohio Republican Party chairman.

<text>This is a list of named craters on Mercury, the innermost planet of the Solar System &quot;(for other features, see list of geological features on Mercury)&quot;. Most Mercurian craters are named after famous writers, artists and composers. According to the rules by IAU&#x27;s Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature, all new craters must be named after an artist that was famous for more than fifty years, and dead for more than three years, before the date they are named. Craters larger than 250 km in diameter are referred to as &quot;basins&quot; &quot;(also see )&quot;.

, there are 414 named Mercurian craters, a small fraction of the total number of named Solar System craters, most of which are lunar, Martian and Venerian craters.

Other, non-planetary bodies with numerous named craters include Callisto (141), Ganymede (131), Rhea (128), Vesta (90), Ceres (90), Dione (73), Iapetus (58), Enceladus (53), Tethys (50) and Europa (41). For a full list, &quot;see List of craters in the Solar System&quot;.

As on the Moon and Mars, sequences of craters and basins of differing relative ages provide the best means of establishing stratigraphic order on Mercury. Overlap relations among many large mercurian craters and basins are clearer than those on the Moon. Therefore, as this map shows, we can build up many local stratigraphic columns involving both crater or basin materials and nearby plains materials.

Over all of Mercury, the crispness of crater rims and the morphology of their walls, central peaks, ejecta deposits, and secondary-crater fields have undergone systematic changes with time. The youngest craters or basins in a local stratigraphic sequence have the sharpest, crispest appearance. The oldest craters consist only of shallow depressions with slightly raised, rounded rims, some incomplete. On this basis, five age categories of craters and basins have been mapped; the characteristics of each are listed in the explanation. In addition, secondary crater fields are preserved around proportionally far more craters and basins on Mercury than on the Moon or Mars, and are particularly useful in determining overlap relations and degree of modification.

Because only limited photographic evidence was available from &quot;Mariner 10&quot;″s three flybys of the planet, these divisions are often tentative. The five crater groups, from youngest to oldest, are:
* c5: Fresh-appearing, sharp-rimmed, rayed craters. Highest albedo in map area; haloes and rays may extend many crater diameters from rim crests. Superposed on all other map units. Generally smaller and fewer than older craters.
* c4: Fresh but slightly modified craters—Similar in morphology to c5 craters but without bright haloes or rays; sharp rim crests; continuous ejecta blankets; very few superposed secondary craters. Floors consist of crater or smooth plains materials.
* c3: Modified craters—Rim crest continuous but slightly rounded and subdued. Ejecta blanket generally less extensive than those of younger craters of similar size. Superposed craters and rays common; smooth plains and intermediate plains materials cover floors of many craters. Central peaks more common than in c4 craters, probably because of larger average size of c3 craters.
* c2: Subdued craters—Low-rimmed, relatively shallow craters, many with discontinuous rim crests. Floors covered by smooth plains and intermediate plains materials. Crater density of ejecta blankets similar to that of intermediate plains material.
* c1 Degraded craters—Similar to c2 crater material but more deteriorated; many superposed craters.

<text>George Victor Voinovich (July 15, 1936June 12, 2016) was an American politician who served as a United States senator from Ohio from 1999 to 2011. He previously served as the 65th governor of Ohio from 1991 to 1998 and as the 54th mayor of Cleveland from 1980 to 1989; he is the last Republican to serve in that office.

Voinovich spent more than 46 years in public service—first as assistant attorney general of Ohio in 1963 and finally as the senior U.S. senator representing Ohio. He is the 15th person to have served as both the governor of Ohio and a U.S. senator and one of only two Cleveland mayors to later become governor of Ohio and a U.S. senator; the other was Frank Lausche. He is also the only person to have served as both chairman of the National Governors Association and president of the National League of Cities.

==Early life==
Voinovich was born in Cleveland, the son of Josephine (Bernot) and George S. Voinovich. He was the oldest of six children. His father was of Serbian descent (from Kordun, present-day Croatia), and his mother was of Slovenian ancestry.

Voinovich grew up in the Collinwood neighborhood of Cleveland and graduated from Collinwood High School in 1954. He was raised Catholic and was a lifelong member of his neighborhood parish, Our Lady of the Lake in Euclid (formerly Holy Cross). He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in government in 1958 from Ohio University, where he was a member of the fraternity Phi Kappa Tau and served as president of the student body and the men&#x27;s dormitory system. Voinovich received a Juris Doctor in 1961 from the Moritz College of Law at the Ohio State University.

==Early career==
Voinovich began his political career in 1963 as an Assistant Attorney General of Ohio. He then served as a member of the Ohio House of Representatives from 1967 until 1971. From 1971 until 1976, he served as County Auditor of Cuyahoga County, Ohio. In 1971, he made an unsuccessful run for the Republican nomination for mayor of Cleveland against Ralph Perk, who went on to win the general election. From 1977 to 1978, Voinovich served as a member of the Cuyahoga County Board of Commissioners. In 1978, he was elected lieutenant governor of Ohio as the running mate of James A. Rhodes. Voinovich was the first Ohio lieutenant governor not to be elected separately from the governor.

==Mayor of Cleveland, 1980–1989==

===1979 Cleveland mayoral election===

By 1979, elections in Cleveland had become nonpartisan, and with then-Mayor Dennis J. Kucinich (D) about to enter a tough reelection campaign, Voinovich began to consider running for mayor again. Finally, on July 26, he entered the race, calling the decision &quot;one of the most difficult in [his] life&quot;. He remained lieutenant governor until he won the election.
Aside from Kucinich, Voinovich&#x27;s opponents in the race included State Senator Charles Butts and city council majority leader Basil Russo. As the election drew closer, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; endorsed Voinovich. Voter turnout in the primary was greater than that of the 1977 race among Perk, Kucinich and Edward F. Feighan. In the 1979 nonpartisan primary election, Voinovich received 47,000 votes to Kucinich&#x27;s 36,000. Russo (who got 21,000) and Butts (with 19,000) did not qualify for the general election. The biggest surprise was Voinovich&#x27;s showing in predominantly African American wards, where he was expected to finish last. He trailed only Butts, with Kucinich last.

On October 8, 1979, a few days after the primary, Voinovich&#x27;s nine-year-old daughter Molly was struck by a van and killed. The event brought the Voinovich campaign to a virtual halt and made it difficult for Kucinich to attack his opponent. Still, he challenged Voinovich to a series of debates in various Cleveland neighborhoods. Voinovich declined the invitations, saying the debates would be unproductive, but they did debate on November 3 at the City Club. Voinovich won the election with 94,541 votes to Kucinich&#x27;s 73,755.

Voinovich was reelected twice in landslides. In 1981 he defeated former State Representative Patrick Sweeney, 107,472 to 32,940, to win Cleveland&#x27;s first four-year mayoral term. In 1985 he defeated former councilman Gary Kucinich (Dennis Kucinich&#x27;s brother), 82,840 to 32,185.
===&quot;The Comeback City&quot;===
Voinovich was considered shy and a rather low-key politician, a description he adopted himself. Once elected, he met with Ohio Governor James Rhodes to solicit the state government&#x27;s help in clearing up the city&#x27;s debts. Voinovich negotiated a debt repayment schedule and in October 1980, with the state serving as guarantor, eight local banks lent Cleveland $36.2 million, allowing the city to emerge from default. Still, the city&#x27;s economy continued to decline, and federal funding was cut. Two weeks earlier, voters turned down another 0.5 percent income tax increase. The opposition was led by Kucinich, who had been keeping a low profile since losing the election. Voinovich said he would resubmit the tax issue on the February ballot to avoid facing a deficit in 1981. That time the voters approved the tax increase.

By the time Voinovich was elected, Cleveland had become the butt of late night comedians&#x27; jokes about the Cuyahoga River and Mayor Ralph Perk&#x27;s hair catching fire (in separate incidents) and as the only major American city to go bankrupt.

Voinovich took an aggressive approach. He reversed a defensive attitude projected by the Cleveland media, going to &quot;war ... to save one of this country&#x27;s greatest cities&quot;. Others soon jumped on board. For instance, The Smythe-Cramer Co., a local realty firm, tried to restore the city&#x27;s former glory by running a series of ads with photographs of downtown Cleveland captioned &quot;Take Another Look. It&#x27;s Cleveland!&quot; In May 1981, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; sent its Sunday subscribers bumper stickers reading, &quot;New York&#x27;s the Big Apple, but Cleveland&#x27;s a Plum.&quot; The paper also passed out thousands of &quot;Cleveland&#x27;s a Plum&quot; buttons and ran a huge picture of publisher Thomas Vail, with a smiling Voinovich beside him, throwing out the first plum at a Yankees-Indians game. Sportscaster Howard Cosell hailed the city during a baseball game, and Voinovich subsequently presented him with a key to the city. A survey showed 65 percent of the residents of Greater Cleveland were very satisfied with their life in the city and that 57 percent claimed to be very satisfied even in 1978, the year of default. A national poll found Detroit to be the city with the worst image, with New York City second and Cleveland fifth.

The New Cleveland Campaign, a promotion agency formed in 1978, began sending out news releases promoting Cleveland&#x27;s virtues and circulating reprints whenever it got a favorable story. But to show how much the &quot;new&quot; Cleveland had improved, it had to highlight how bad the old Cleveland was. In particular, it stressed the city&#x27;s 1978 default of $15.5 million short-term loans from local banks, even though New York City owed nearly 150 times as much when it received a $2.3 billion federal bailout to avoid bankruptcy in 1975.
The restoration campaign reached its peak in October in the society magazine &quot;Town and Country&quot;&#x27;s article &quot;Cleveland&#x27;s Come-Around&quot;, which said that &quot;businessmen, lawyers and concerned citizens&quot; had rescued the city from &quot;the petulant, pugnacious Dennis Kucinich&quot;. It called Voinovich&#x27;s Operation Improvement Task Force under E. Mandell de Windt &quot;the most significant undertaking in Cleveland since Moses Cleaveland stepped ashore on the bank of the Cuyahoga River in 1786&quot;. It also enticed its readers with Lake Erie and its &quot;beautiful and exciting year-round sailing&quot;.

So confident was Voinovich that during election season he even attracted presidential candidates Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan to debate in Cleveland. &quot;Cleveland is making a comeback,&quot; &quot;Time&quot; declared at the close of 1980. &quot;During the past year, convention business has flourished, school desegregation has proceeded peacefully, and a modest construction boom has begun... Most impressive of all, the city dug itself out of default.&quot;

===Downtown development and other improvements===
In order to allow them to accomplish more, Voinovich felt that the terms for mayor and members of the Cleveland City Council ought to be extended. He offered a referendum to voters to extend them from two to four years and also asked voters to approve cutting the number of council members from 33 to 21 to help ease the city&#x27;s strained economy. Both proposals passed.

During the Voinovich years neighborhoods began to see some improvement, starting with the Lexington Village housing project, $149 million in Urban Development Action Grants, and $3 billion of construction underway or completed. In particular, the neighborhoods of Hough and Fairfax, then two of Cleveland&#x27;s worst east side neighborhoods, began to see new houses built and less criminal activity. Voinovich also quietly moved to reconcile the warring groups of the 1970s. He made peace with business leaders and posed with them in photographs that ran in New Cleveland Campaign ads in business magazines, captioned with the Voinovich slogan &quot;Together, we can do it.&quot; He refined the neighborhood groups, which, with the breakdown of the Democratic Party, had become the most potent political forces in the city. He also extended his hand to unions, in particular the Teamsters.

As mayor, Voinovich was a member of the National League of Cities, of which he was elected president in 1985. Voinovich also oversaw an urban renaissance downtown. Sohio (purchased by BP America in 1987), Ohio Bell, and Eaton Corporation all built new offices downtown (most notably the BP Building). Brothers Richard and David Jacobs rescued the troubled Cleveland Indians. The two also improved the desolate area located by the Erieview Tower and turned it into the glass-roofed Galleria at Erieview. Voinovich also enticed Society Bank to build the Society Center, the largest skyscraper in Cleveland and the 15th largest in the nation (since renamed Key Tower). In addition, the National Civic League awarded Cleveland the All-America City Award three times in five years (1982, 1984, 1986), in addition to its first, won in 1950.

===Municipal Light===
One of the major controversies of the previous Kucinich administration was its cancellation of the sale of Cleveland Municipal Light (now Cleveland Public Power). Kucinich&#x27;s insistence on saving it from being absorbed into the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company (CEI) led the business community to force Cleveland into default. Voinovich&#x27;s successful negotiations reversed this action when he first took office, but Voinovich&#x27;s pro-business attitude did not change CEI&#x27;s position on the issue, as they persisted in making efforts to buy out Muni Light and pressuring Voinovich into giving them the right to do so. Voinovich resisted. Early in his tenure, he arranged for capital improvements to strengthen Muni Light&#x27;s operation, and by 1982, it was able to compete with CEI. He asserted that the company was making attempts to cripple Muni Light by lobbying council against much-needed legislation. &quot;We still have a battle going on,&quot; Voinovich said. &quot;They [CEI] are as dedicated as ever to laying away the Municipal Light system.&quot;

The rebuilding process began through Voinovich&#x27;s administration and improvements were made throughout the company including equipment upgrades and increased wages for all employees. To reflect all the change Municipal Light officially changed its name to Cleveland Public Power (CPP) in 1983. In 1984, the company received the American Municipal Power Association&#x27;s Scattergood Award for outstanding system operation and achievement.

===1988 Senate race===

In 1988, Voinovich ran for the Senate seat of Howard Metzenbaum, in a hard-fought and negative campaign. Voinovich accused Metzenbaum of being soft on child pornography, charges that were roundly criticized by many, including John Glenn who recorded a statement for television refuting Voinovich&#x27;s charges. Metzenbaum won the election, 57% to 43%, even as George H. W. Bush carried the state by 11 percentage points.

==Governorship==
In 1990, Voinovich was nominated by the Republicans to replace Governor Richard F. Celeste, a Democrat who was barred from running for a third consecutive term. Voinovich defeated the Democratic nominee, Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr.

During his first four years he pulled Ohio out of a $1.5 billion deficit and led efforts to reform welfare and eliminate unfunded mandates. In 1991 Voinovich served as the Chairman of the Midwestern Governors Association. Voinovich was reelected in 1994, defeating Democrat Robert L. Burch Jr. with 72% of the vote, the largest share of the vote of any governor up for election that year and the largest margin of victory for any Ohio governor in the 20th century. During his second term, Voinovich appointed Nancy Hollister, the state&#x27;s first female lieutenant governor, and Cincinnati mayor Kenneth Blackwell, the state treasurer who became the first African-American to hold state office in Ohio.

Voinovich&#x27;s tenure as governor saw Ohio&#x27;s unemployment rate fall to a 25-year low. The state created more than 500,000 new jobs, the Medicaid growth rate was cut by more than two-thirds, and enrollment in welfare was cut in half. Under Voinovich, Ohio was ranked No. 1 in the nation by &quot;Site Selection Magazine&quot; for new and expanding business facilities.

===Second term===
In 1995 Voinovich was named Public Official of the Year by the &quot;National Journal&quot;. He is credited with leading efforts to create a public voucher plan that used public funds to pay tuition at church-affiliated schools. After significant litigation over the program, the US Supreme Court ruled in a 5–4 decision that the program did not violate the constitutional prohibition against promoting religion in public schools. By the end of his second term, Ohio led the nation in percentage of eligible children participating in the Head Start Program.

When the state legislature wanted to close Central State University, Ohio&#x27;s only historically black state-supported college, Voinovich stepped in by appointing a new board and convincing John Garland to become president.

As both mayor and governor, Voinovich helped to advertise Cleveland as the true birthplace of rock and roll. Beginning in 1985 Voinovich, the City of Cleveland and the State of Ohio began lobbying for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum to be built in Cleveland. It eventually opened in 1995. As a nod to his efforts, the Hall&#x27;s main atrium was renamed the George V. Voinovich Atrium.

===Beyond the governor&#x27;s office===
In 1996, Voinovich was the first governor to endorse U.S. Senator Robert J. Dole&#x27;s bid for the Republican presidential nomination. Later, Voinovich was among nine candidates asked to submit to background checks as potential vice-presidential running mates for Dole. Voinovich withdrew his name from consideration, reiterating his desire to run for the U.S. Senate in 1998.

In 1998, barred by term limits from running for a third term as governor, Voinovich ran for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by longtime incumbent Democrat John Glenn. He won the election over Democratic nominee Mary O. Boyle. Voinovich was briefly succeeded by Nancy Hollister upon his resignation as governor and before he entered the Senate. Hollister was succeeded by the newly elected Bob Taft in January 1999. It was the first time a Republican governor in Ohio had been succeeded by another Republican governor since 1904.

==Senate career==

=== Overview ===

In the Senate, Voinovich opposed lowering tax rates. He frequently joined Democrats on tax issues and in 2000 was the only Republican in Congress to vote against a bill providing for relief from the &quot;marriage penalty&quot;.

In November 2004, in his bid for reelection, Voinovich defeated the Democratic nominee, Ohio state senator and former U.S. Representative Eric D. Fingerhut. With 64% of the vote, Voinovich won all 88 Ohio counties and the most votes ever in a U.S. Senate race in Ohio, 3.5 million.

Voinovich gained national attention when he gave a speech tearfully opposing President George W. Bush&#x27;s nomination of John R. Bolton for U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations at Bolton&#x27;s hearing in front of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Voinovich remarked, &quot;I don&#x27;t feel comfortable voting today on Mr. John Bolton.&quot; As a result, the committee recessed without a vote, stalling the nomination. Democrats refused to invoke cloture and end debate on the nomination; the first time, Voinovich voted to end debate, but the second time he joined Democrats in voting to extend debate and urged Bush to choose another nominee.

In January 2007, Voinovich expressed concern to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that Bush&#x27;s plan to increase troop levels in Iraq would not be effective: &quot;At this stage of the game, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to happen.&quot; As a moderate Republican, Voinovich was viewed as one of few who could potentially influence Bush. Five months later, Voinovich wrote Bush a five-page letter requesting that the U.S. begin pulling troops from Iraq and that the Iraqis start taking care of their own territory, calling for a &quot;comprehensive plan for our country&#x27;s gradual military disengagement from Iraq&quot;.

On April 7, 2008, Voinovich departed from the Republican platform and stated at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing regarding the war in Iraq: &quot;We&#x27;ve kind of bankrupted this country&quot; through war spending. &quot;We&#x27;re in a recession ... and God knows how long it&#x27;s going to last.&quot;

When Michigan became the eighth state to accede to the Great Lakes Compact on July 9, 2008, Voinovich was one of the leading legislators in supporting the interstate compact&#x27;s passage in Congress.

On January 20, 2009, Voinovich was appointed to the Appropriations Committee. His appointment marked the first time an Ohioan served on the coveted Senate committee since Mike DeWine lost his 2006 reelection bid. In accepting the appointment, Voinovich relinquished his seat on the Foreign Relations Committee.

On July 22, 2009, Voinovich opposed a measure that would have allowed people to cross state lines with concealed weapons.

From June 25, 2007 to January 3, 2009, Voinovich sat at what is traditionally known as the Senate&#x27;s &quot;candy desk&quot;.

Voinovich voted in favor of the Matthew Shepard Act.

On December 18, 2010, Voinovich voted in favor of the Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell Repeal Act of 2010.

===Fiscal responsibility===
As the Senate&#x27;s leading debt hawk, Voinovich introduced the Securing America&#x27;s Future Economy (SAFE) Commission Act in every Congress in which he served. The measure proposed the establishment of a national commission to examine the nation&#x27;s tax and entitlement systems and present long-term solutions to place the United States on a fiscally sustainable course and ensure the solvency of entitlement programs for future generations. In January 2010, Voinovich met with President Obama to discuss the urgency of the nation&#x27;s fiscal crisis. Four days later, Obama publicly endorsed the Conrad-Gregg statutory debt commission, which was modeled after Voinovich&#x27;s SAFE Commission. In his 2010 State of the Union address Obama announced that he would create the debt commission by executive order because it had failed to pass the Senate.

===National security===
Called &quot;the Senate&#x27;s leading Balkan expert&quot; and a &quot;leader in the fight against anti-Semitism and hate crime against all groups,&quot; Voinovich was a key voice on the Foreign Relations Committee about the OSCE and the relationship between the United States and countries in Eastern Europe in particular.

He played a leadership role in strengthening and enlarging the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and was the only member of Congress in the room at the 2002 NATO summit in Prague, where membership was formally extended to Latvia, Bulgaria, Estonia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. Voinovich was an active participant in the annual Brussels Forum from its inception in 2007, and served as chairman of the U.S. congressional delegation to the conference in 2010.

===Israel===

As senator and a prominent member of its Foreign Relations Committee, Voinovich consistently supported measures to strengthen Israel. In addition, Voinovich devoted himself to combating anti-Semitism, especially through involvement in the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe and its Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights.

===American competitiveness===
Voinovich authored the National Infrastructure Improvement Act, which established a commission to provide concrete recommendations for current and future infrastructure needs. He was the main sponsor of five-year reauthorizations of the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) in 2002 and 2008, which fostered economic development in the 13 Appalachian states and in Ohio&#x27;s 29 Appalachian counties.

===Improving government===
The &quot;Herald Star&quot; wrote that Voinovich &quot;considers the impact of his votes...choosing carefully without regard for what the political impact might be on him personally&quot;. Government Executive wrote, &quot;no matter what anyone thinks of George Voinovich or Daniel Akaka&#x27;s politics in general, no one can deny that they know their federal employee issues cold.&quot;

===Energy independence===
Voinovich long championed the need for a &quot;Second Declaration of Independence&quot;, referring to the nation&#x27;s energy situation. He supported clean air legislation (&quot;Voinovich has idea on clearing the air&quot;, &quot;The Dayton Daily News&quot;, April 30, 2002) and argued for nuclear-energy development because it &quot;provides a dependable, continuous stream of electricity, supports thousands of jobs, and does not emit any greenhouse gases&quot; (&quot;Depoliticizing decisions&quot;, &quot;The Columbus Dispatch&quot;, June 12, 2010). He served as Chairman and ranking member of the EPW Clean Air and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee, introducing legislation that helped to pave the way for applications for new nuclear power plants in the U.S.

===Great Lakes===
Voinovich sponsored legislation aimed to protect the Great Lakes from foreign species and preserve &quot;our ultimate jewels, the five Great Lakes&quot;. He lobbied his colleagues in the Senate as well as Great Lakes governors and administration officials to take real action. Working with Senator Carl Levin, he introduced legislation to ratify the Great Lakes Compact, a bipartisan agreement among the Great Lakes states to protect the Great Lakes through better water management, conservation, and public involvement.

===2010 campaign===
In a press conference in January 2009, Voinovich announced he would not be seeking a third term, saying, &quot;I must devote my full time, energy and focus to the job I was elected to do, the job in front of me, which seeking a third term — with the money-raising and campaigning that it would require — would not allow me to do.&quot; Voinovich also said that after 44 years in public office it was time for him to relax and spend time with his wife Janet and his family. Pundits felt he would have won had he decided to run against the Democratic nominee Lee Fisher.

Upon Voinovich&#x27;s announcement, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; wrote, &quot;After decades in an arena that has sullied so many, Voinovich&#x27;s personal integrity remains unquestioned. He has never been afraid to work across the aisle, and has never forgotten that tax money comes from the wallets of hard-working people.&quot;

After retiring in January 2011, Voinovich was named a Senior Fellow at Cleveland State University at the Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs, and Ohio Visiting Professor of Leadership and Public Affairs at the George V. Voinovich School of Leadership and Public Affairs at Ohio University. In 1998, Ohio University renamed the Institute of Local Government and Rural Development the Voinovich Center for Leadership and Public Affairs, and in 2007 the Ohio Board of Regents voted to rename the center a school. Since being honored in 1998, Voinovich remained committed to the success of the school.

On June 10, 2016, two days before his death, Voinovich delivered public remarks at the 25th Slovenian Independence Day event at Cleveland City Hall. He was to be a delegate to the July 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland.

===Honors===

Voinovich has been honored several times in his hometown of Cleveland by having prominent landmarks named after him, including Voinovich Bicentennial Park in the city&#x27;s North Coast Harbor district and the George V. Voinovich Bridges spanning downtown.
The Voinovich Livestock Center at the Ohio Expo Center and State Fair in Columbus is named in honor of Voinovich. The lawn in front of the center is the site of &quot;Spountain&quot;, a sculpture by Barry Gunderson. It is also the site of the Farm Bureau Memorial tree, which was planted in soil from all 88 Ohio counties in 1976 during the Ohio Farm Bureau Bicentennial.

==Personal life and death==
Voinovich married his wife, Janet (née Allan), in 1962. They had four children, George, Betsy, Peter, and Molly, and nine grandchildren. Molly, their youngest child, was killed at age 9 after being struck by a van as she walked home from school.

In June 2003, doctors implanted a pacemaker into Voinovich&#x27;s heart because his heart rate had slowed down due to progressive sinus bradycardia.

Voinovich died at his home in Cleveland on June 12, 2016, at the age of 79.

<text>Equatoria is the southernmost region of South Sudan, along the upper reaches of the White Nile and the border between South Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Juba, the national capital is the largest city in South Sudan, is located in Equatoria. Originally a province of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, it also contained most of northern parts of present-day Uganda, including Lake Albert and West Nile. It was an idealistic effort to create a model state in the interior of Africa that never consisted of more than a handful of adventurers and soldiers in isolated outposts.

Equatoria was established by Samuel Baker in 1870. Charles George Gordon took over as governor in 1874, followed by Emin Pasha in 1878. The Mahdist Revolt put an end to Equatoria as an Egyptian outpost in 1889. Later British Governors included Martin Willoughby Parr. Important towns in Equatoria included Lado, Gondokoro, Dufile and Wadelai. The last two former areas of Equatoria, Lake Albert and West Nile are now situated in Uganda.

Under Anglo-Egyptian rule, most of Equatoria became one of the eight original provinces of Sudan. The region of Bahr el Ghazal was split from Equatoria in 1948. In 1976, Equatoria was further split into the provinces of East and West Equatoria. The region has been troubled with violence during both the First and Second Sudanese Civil Wars, as well as the anti-Ugandan insurgencies based in Sudan such as the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army and West Nile Bank Front.

== Culture ==
Due to many years of civil war, the Equatorian culture is heavily influenced by the countries neighboring Equatoria and hosting Equatorians. Many Equatorians fled to Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, Sudan, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and Europe, where they interacted with the nationals and learnt their languages and culture. For most of those who remained in the country, or went North to Sudan and Egypt, they greatly assimilated Arabic culture.

Most Equatorians kept the core of their culture even while in exile and diaspora. Traditionally, culture is highly upheld and a great focus is given to knowing one&#x27;s origin and dialect. Although the common languages spoken in Equatoria are Juba Arabic/Arabi Juba and English, Lingala and Kiswahili are being introduced to the population to improve the country&#x27;s relations with its East African neighbors. Many musicians from Equatoria use English, Lingala, Kiswahili, Arabi Juba (Arabic Creole), their language or dialect or a mix of all. Popular artists sing Afro-beat, R&amp;B, and zouk. Dynamiq is popular for his reggae.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
In the 19th century, Egypt controlled Sudan and established the Equatoria province to further control its interests over the Nile. The Egyptian authorities selected British explorer Sir Samuel Baker to establish Equatoria for them, which he did in 1870. Baker was instructed to establish trading posts along the White Nile and Gondokoro (&quot;Gondu kuru&quot;, means &quot;difficult to dig&quot;, in Bari), a trading center located on the east bank of the White Nile in Southern Sudan. Gondokoro was an important center since it was located within a few kilometres from the cutoff point of navigability of the Nile from Khartoum. It is presently located near the city of Juba in Equatoria.

Baker&#x27;s attempt to create additional trading posts and control Equatoria was unsuccessful because villages surrounding Gondokoro were frequently bypassed by Arab invaders who wanted to impose their culture and way of life on the people. King Gbudwe who ruled the western part of Equatoria at the time as The King of Azande Kingdom despised the Arab culture and way of life and encouraged the tribes to resist the invaders and protect their African culture and their way of life. The invaders were met with stiff resistance from Equatorian tribes such as the Azande, Bari, Lokoya, Otuho, and Pari.

At the end of Baker&#x27;s service as governor, British general Charles George Gordon was appointed governor of Sudan. Gordon took over in 1874 and administered the region until 1876. He was more successful in creating additional trading posts in the area. In 1876, Gordon&#x27;s views clashed with those of the Egyptian governor of Khartoum forcing him to go back to London.

In 1878 Gordon was succeeded by the Chief Medical Officer of the Equatoria province, Mehemet Emin, popularly known as Emin Pasha. Emin made his headquarters at Lado (now in South Sudan). Emin Pasha had little influence over the area because the Khartoum governor was uninterested in his development proposals for the Equatoria region.

In 1881, Muhammad Ahmad Abdullah, a Muslim religious leader, proclaimed himself the Mahdi (&quot;expected one&quot;) and began a holy war to unify the tribes of Western and Central Sudan, including Equatoria. By 1883 the Mahdists had cut off outside communications. However, Emin Pasha managed to request assistance from Britain via Buganda. The British sent the explorer Henry Morton Stanley and who led a relief expedition, called the &quot;Advance,&quot; in February 1887 to rescue Emin. The Advance navigated up the Congo River and then through the Ituri Forest, one of the most difficult forest routes in Africa, resulting in the loss of two-thirds of the expedition&#x27;s personnel. While the Advance succeeded in reaching Emin Pasha by February of the following year, the Mahdists had already overrun the bulk of the province, and Emin had already been deposed as governor by his officers in August 1887. The Advance reached the coast, with Emin, by the end of the year, by which point the Mahdists were firmly in control of Equatoria.

In 1898, the Mahdist State was overthrown by the Anglo-Egyptian force led by British Field Marshal Lord Kitchener. Sudan was proclaimed a condominium under British-Egyptian administration with Equatoria being administered by the British.

=== British policy ===
Equatoria received little attention from the British prior to World War I. Equatoria was closed to outside influences and developed along indigenous lines. As a result, the region remained isolated and underdeveloped. Limited social services to the region were provided by Christian missionaries who opened schools and medical clinics. The education provided by the missionaries was mainly limited to learning English language and arithmetic.

=== Sudanese independence ===
In February 1953, the United Kingdom and Egypt reached an agreement providing for Sudanese self-government and self-determination. On January 1, 1956 Sudan gained independence from the British and Egyptian governments. The new state was under the control of the Arab led Khartoum government. The Arab Khartoum government had promised Southerners full participation in the political system, however, after independence the Khartoum government reneged on its promises. Southerners were denied participation in free elections and marginalized from political power. The government actions created resentment in the south that led to a mutiny by a group of Equatorians sparking the 21 year civil war (1955–1972 and 1983–2004).

=== Equatoria Corps ===
Equatorians played an instrumental role in the struggle for autonomy in South Sudan. The origins of Sudan&#x27;s civil war dates back to 1955, a year before independence, when it became clear the Arabs were going to take over the national government in Khartoum. Equatoria gave its name to the southernmost unit of the British Sudan Defence Force, formed during the Anglo-Egyptian administration. This was the Equatoria or Southern Corps.

On August 18, 1955, No. 2 Company of the Equatoria Corps mutinied at Torit, Eastern Equatoria. No. 2 Company had been ordered to make ready to move to the north, but instead of obeying, the troops mutinied, along with other Southern soldiers across the south in Juba, Yei, Yambio, and Maridi. The Khartoum government sent other Sudan Defence Force units to quell the rebellion and many mutineers of the Equatoria Corps went into hiding rather than surrender. This marked the beginning of the first civil war in southern Sudan. The rebellion that emerged from the Equatoria Corps was later called Anya Nya and the leaders were separatists, who demanded the creation of a separate South Sudanese nation, free from Arab domination. The Equatorian leaders of the Anya Nya and founders of the struggle were Rev. Fr Saturnino Ohure who was of Lotuho origin and was said to have been the first man to have fired a bullet, and launched the start of the first civil war, in Torit; Fr. Saturnino Lohure from Otuho; Aggrey Jaden from Pojulu Joseph Ohide, from Otuho Marko Rume, from Kuku Ezboni Mondiri, from Moru Albino Tombe, from Lokoya Tafeng Lodongi, from Otuho Lazaru Mutek, from Otuho Benjamin Loki, from Pojulu Elia Lupe, from Kakwa Elia Kuzee, from ZandeTimon Boro, from Moru Dominic Dabi Manango, from Zande Alison Monani Magaya, from Zande Isaiah Paul, from Zande Dominic Kassiano Dombo, from Zande and many others.

The Khartoum government sent its forces to arrest the rebels and capture anyone who supported their cause. By the early 1960s civilians believed to be Anya Nya sympathizers were arrested and shipped to Kodok concentration camp where they were tortured and killed. Some of the first detainees and survivors of the horrific torture at Kodok include Emmanuel Lukudu and Philip Lomodong Lako.

By 1969 the Equatorian rebels found support among foreign governments and were able to obtained weapons and supplies. Anya Nya recruits were trained in Israel where they also got some of their weapons. The Anya Nya rebels received financial assistance from Southern Sudanese and Southern exiles from the Middle East, Western Europe, and North America. By the late 1960s, the war had resulted in the deaths of half a million people and several hundred thousand southerners escaped to hide in the forests or to refugee camps in neighboring countries.

Anya Nya controlled the southern countryside while the government forces controlled the major towns in the region. The Anya Nya rebels were small in number and scattered all over the region making their operations ineffective. It is estimated that there were between 5,000 and 10,000 Anya Nya rebels.

On May 25, 1969, Colonel Gaafar Muhammed Nimeiri led a military coup and overthrew General Ibrahim Abboud&#x27;s regime. In 1971 Joseph Lagu, from the Madi ethnic group, became the leader of the southern forces opposed to Khartoum government and founded the South Sudan Liberation Movement (SSLM). Anya Nya leaders united and rallied behind Lagu. Lagu was also supported by exiled southern politicians. With Lagu&#x27;s leadership the SSLM created a governing infrastructure throughout many areas in southern Sudan. In 1972 Nimeri held negotiations with the Anya Nya at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. At the talks the Anya Nya demanded a separate southern government and an army to defend the south. Ethiopia&#x27;s Emperor Haile Selassie moderated the talks and helped the two sides reach an agreement. The result was the Addis Ababa Agreement. The agreement granted autonomy for the South with three provinces: Equatoria, Bar al Ghazal and Upper Nile. The south would have a regional president appointed by the national president to oversee all aspects of government in the region. The national government would maintain authority over defense, foreign affairs, currency, and finance, and economic and social planning, and interregional concerns. The members of the Anya Nya would be incorporated into the Sudanese army and have equal status with the northern forces. The agreement declared Arabic as Sudan&#x27;s official language and English as the south&#x27;s principal language for administration and schooling. Despite opposition from SSLM leaders on the terms of the Agreement, Joseph Lagu approved the agreement and both sides agreed to a cease-fire. The Addis Ababa Accords were signed on March 27, 1972 and the Sudanese celebrated that day as National Unity Day. This agreement resulted in a hiatus in the Sudanese civil war from 1972 to 1983.

=== Recent history ===
In 1983, President Gaafar Nimeiry abolished the parliament and embarked on a campaign to Islamize all of Sudan. He outlawed political parties and enacted Sharia law in the penal code. Non-Muslim southerners were now forced to obey Islamic laws and traditions. The policies revived southern opposition and military insurgency in the South. In 1985 Abdel Rahman Swar al-Dahab led a coup and overthrew the regime. In 1986, Sadiq al-Mahdi was elected president of Sudan. The new regime began negotiations led by Colonel John Garang de Mabior, the leader of the Sala, but failed to reach an agreement to end the southern insurgency. Civil war has continued since then, but international pressure led SPLA and the Khartoum government to reach an agreement to end the 21-year civil war.

In January 2020, the National Alliance for Democracy and Freedom Action (NADAFA) sought to join talks in Rome seeking to resolve political rifts within South Sudan. The group is a coalition of holdout political groups including the People’s Democratic Movement (PDM), which was not signatory to the peace agreement signed by President Salva Kiir’s South Sudanese government in 2018. NADAFA sought a power-sharing arrangement in the new national government, with &quot;People’s Constitutional Conventions&quot; held in Equatoria, Upper Nile and Bahr al Ghazal. In September 2020, Sudans Post published a message from Dr. Hakim Dario, the leader of NADAFA, expressing concern that the new nation had been named &quot;South Sudan&quot; and proposed that the nation should be called &quot;Equatoria Federal Republic&quot;.

On February 9, 2022, the Azande community in Yambio held a coronation ceremony for King Atoroba Peni Rikito Gbudue. The traditional royal title was last held by King Rikito&#x27;s great-grandfather King Gbudue, who died in 1905. Some neighboring cultural groups such as the Maridi and Balanda people wrote letters to the new king, warning him that they would not be subjects to the restored kingdom, with the Maridi letter specifically rejecting any ethnic political divisions, saying &quot;We stand to promote the Republic of South Sudan, not the culture of a specific group.” However, Badagbu Daniel Rimbasa, the king&#x27;s brother, stated that the new king will not participate in politics. “It’s purely promotion of our culture and its preservation and heritage, not political.”

<doc id="363301" wikidata="Q141699" url="?curid=363301" title="Sept-Îles, Quebec">
<text>Sept-Îles (, , ) is a city in the Côte-Nord region of eastern Quebec. Along with Brador and Blanc-Sablon, Sept-Îles is one of the oldest places in the province. The population was 24,569 as of the 2021 Canadian census. The town is called Uashat, meaning &quot;bay&quot; in Innu-aimun.

The city is well known for having major iron companies like Iron Ore Company of Canada and SFP Pointe-Noire iron ore transport service company. The city relies heavily on the iron industry. Sept-Îles has among the highest average wages and the highest average wage increases.

It is among the northernmost places with a paved connection to the rest of Quebec&#x27;s road network. The only settlements on the paved road network that are farther north are Fermont, Radisson and Chisasibi, the latter two of which are in the extreme western part of the province at the north end of the James Bay Road. The only other settlements at higher latitudes in the province are mostly isolated Cree, Innu, or Inuit villages, with access limited to seasonal gravel roads.

Sept-Îles is the seat of the judicial district of Mingan. The city is also home to the most highly attended recreational volleyball tournament in the province: the &quot;Tournoi Orange&quot;, which consists of 405 teams and close to 800 volleyball games.

== History ==
The first inhabitants of the area were varying cultures of aboriginal peoples. The &quot;Montagnais&quot; or Innu people, who call it &quot;Uashat&quot; (&quot;Great Bay&quot;), have lived there since before the time of European encounter. Jacques Cartier sailed by the islands in 1535 and made the first written record of them, calling them the &quot;Ysles Rondes&quot; (&quot;Round Islands&quot;). He was not the first European in the area, as he encountered Basque fishermen who came annually from Europe for whaling and cod fishing.

Early European economic activity in Sept-Îles was based on fishing and the fur trade. In 1650, Jean de Quen founded a mission there, called L&#x27;Ange- Gardien. By 1658, a fur trade post existed there, established by La Compagnie des Habitants, and Louis Jolliet established another trading post in 1679. Great Britain took over Canada from France in 1763 after its victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War, and in 1802, the North West Company (NWC) took over the post. When the North West Company and Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC) merged in 1821, Sept Iles (also known as Seven Islands) became a HBC post. When its lease expired in 1822, it was closed. The post operated again from 1831 to 1859. The HBC opened a store in a new location in 1870.
In 1875, the parish of Saint-Joseph-des-Sept-Îles was created, and in 1886, its post office opened under the English name &quot;Seven Islands&quot; (which was francized to &quot;Sept-Îles&quot; in 1933).

Lacking road access at the time, the town got its first pier in 1908. The City of Sept-Îles was incorporated in 1951, on the 300th anniversary of the first Catholic Mass held in the village.

The modern Sept-Îles was built rapidly during the construction of the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway, the railway link to the northern town of Schefferville. The railway was built between 1950 and 1954 by the Iron Ore Company of Canada. Iron ore mined near Schefferville and Wabush, Labrador, was transported on this railway and shipped from the Port of Sept-Îles. Shipment of the important new commodity resulted in investments that turned this into a major port. In 1952, the HBC built a new store, which was extended in 1954, and expanded with a groceteria in 1956 and a distribution warehouse in 1959.

With the iron ore business, the Sept-Îles deep-water seaport was second in Canada only to Vancouver in terms of yearly tonnage. The huge engineering project led to a major increase in population, and housing was quickly built to accommodate them. The town grew from 2,000 inhabitants in 1951 to 14,000 in 1961, and 31,000 in 1981. The decline in worldwide iron ore prices in recent decades has since caused employment and population to decrease. On January 11, 1986, the HBC store closed.

During the early 1990s, some new jobs accompanied the construction and operation of the new Aluminerie Alouette inc. aluminum processing plant. Construction for Phase 1 began in September 1989, and operation started in 1992. Construction of Phase 2 began in 2003.

In February 2003, the city amalgamated with the municipalities of Gallix and Moisie. The city includes the neighbourhoods of Arnaud, Clarke-City, De Grasse, de la Pointe, de la Rivière, Ferland, La Boule, Lac Labrie, Matamec, Plages, Pointe-Noire and Val-Marguerite.

==Geography ==

Located on the north shore of the Saint Lawrence River, between the Sainte-Marguerite and Moisie rivers, Sept-Îles lies on the shore of a deep-water bay fronted by a seven-island archipelago, about east of Baie-Comeau. The bay constitutes a natural harbour.

The seven islands referred to in its name are named:
* &quot;La Grosse Boule&quot; (&quot;the big ball&quot;)
* &quot;La Petite Boule&quot; (&quot;the small ball&quot;)
* &quot;La Grande Basque&quot; (&quot;the large Basque&quot;, named after the visiting Basque fishermen)
* &quot;La Petite Basque&quot; (&quot;the small Basque&quot;)
* &quot;Île Manowin&quot; (from the Montagnais &quot;manouane&quot; meaning &quot;where eggs are picked&quot;)
* &quot;Île du Corossol&quot; (named after the French ship &quot;Corossol&quot; wrecked on the island in 1693; site of a lighthouse and a bird sanctuary)
* &quot;Îlets Dequen&quot; (a group of tiny islands named after Jean de Quen who founded the local Catholic mission in 1650)

The archipelago is under provincial jurisdiction, with some parts administered by the federal government or by individuals.

There are two First Nations reserves in the area: Uashat in the western city proper, and Maliotenam in the east near the Moisie River.

===Climate===

Winters are long, very cold, and snowy, lasting from late October to late April, but milder than more inland locations, with a January high of and a January low of . Overall precipitation is unusually high for a subarctic climate, and snow totals correspondingly heavy, averaging per season, with an average depth of annually or from December to April inclusive. Summers are mildly warm, with a July high of ; summers thus display stronger maritime influence than do winters. Precipitation is significant year-round, but it is lowest from January to March.

Iron ore from Wabush and Bloom Lake is also shipped at Point Noire port facilities. The Aluminerie Alouette, in activity since 1992, has a large part in the local employment since construction started in 1989. Since its major expansion that started in 2005, it is now the largest primary aluminum smelter in the Americas. As a service centre for northeastern Québec, Sept-Îles economy is also powered by many jobs in the services sector.

==Tourism==

Since 2009, Sept-Îles has been part of the Saint-Laurent destination circuit, which has nine international cruise ports. On a larger scale, an alliance is being created with other ports in northeastern America and Canada under the auspices of Canada New England. The international cruises in Sept-Îles are led by the non-profit organization Destination Sept-Îles Nakauinanu.M The organization&#x27;s mission is to enable the various public and private bodies to enjoy a permanent structure, in the form of a one-stop shop, enabling them to work jointly on the development and promotion of the City of Sept-Îles and from its surroundings to international cruise lines.

<text>Theatresports is a form of improvisational theatre, which uses the format of a competition for dramatic effect. Opposing teams can perform scenes based on audience suggestions, with ratings by the audience or by a panel of judges. Developed by director Keith Johnstone in Calgary, Alberta, in 1977, the concept of Theatresports originated in Johnstone&#x27;s observations of techniques used in professional wrestling to generate heat, or audience reaction.

==Derivatives==
ComedySportz, started in 1984 in Milwaukee, WI, tends to emphasise the sports competition format more than Theatresports, for example by having a referee who awards points and administers fouls. The Australian shows &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot; and &quot;TheatreGames LIVE&quot; follow a similar format to these shows. New York City&#x27;s Face Off Unlimited has also adapted the concept to numerous productions. Two similar formats, Ligue nationale d&#x27;improvisation and Canadian Improv Games both also officially debuted in 1977 in Quebec and Ontario, respectively. The Canadian Improv Games had been doing competitive improv at various events as early as 1974.

<text>The gull-billed tern (Gelochelidon nilotica), formerly &quot;Sterna nilotica&quot;, is a tern in the family Laridae. It is widely distributed and breeds in scattered localities in Europe, Asia, northwest Africa, and the Americas. The Australian gull-billed tern was previously considered a subspecies.

==Taxonomy==
The gull-billed tern was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with terns in the genus &quot;Sterna&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Sterna nilotica&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;Egyptian tern&quot; that had been described in 1785 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his book &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. Latham had in turn based his own account on that by the Swedish naturalist Fredrik Hasselquist that was published in 1757. The gull-billed tern was moved to the resurrected genus &quot;Gelochelidon&quot; based on a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2005. The genus had been introduced in 1830 by the German zoologist Alfred Brehm. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;gelaō&quot; meaning &quot;to laugh&quot; with &quot;khelidōn&quot; meaning &quot;swallow&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;nilotica&quot; is from Latin &quot;niloticus&quot; meaning &quot;of the River Nile&quot;.

Five subspecies are recognised:
==Description==

This is a fairly large and powerful tern, similar in size and general appearance to a Sandwich tern, but the short thick gull-like bill, broad wings, long legs and robust body are distinctive. The summer adult has grey upperparts, white underparts, a black cap, strong black bill and black legs. The call is a characteristic &quot;ker-wik&quot;. It is in length and in wingspan. Body mass ranges from .

In winter, the cap is lost, and there is a dark patch through the eye like a Forster&#x27;s tern or a Mediterranean gull. Juvenile gull-billed terns have a fainter mask, but otherwise look much like winter adults.

Juvenile Sandwich terns have a short bill, and are frequently mistaken for gull-billed tern where the latter species is uncommon, such as North Sea coasts.

==Distribution and habitat==
It breeds in warmer parts of the world in southern Europe, temperate and eastern Asia, both coasts of North America, eastern South America. This bird has a number of geographical races, differing mainly in size and minor plumage details.

All forms show a post-breeding dispersal, but the northern breeders are most migratory, wintering south to Africa, the Caribbean and northern South America, southern Asia and New Zealand.

The gull-billed tern is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

==Behaviour and ecology==

===Breeding===
The gull-billed tern breeds in colonies on lakes, marshes and coasts (including bays and earthen levees). It nests in a ground scrape and lays two to five eggs. While widely distributed in freshwater areas in Eurasia, it is associated almost solely with saltwater, coastal areas in North America.

===Food and feeding===
This is a somewhat atypical tern, in appearance like a &quot;Sterna&quot; tern, but with feeding habits more like the &quot;Chlidonias&quot; marsh terns, black tern and white-winged tern. It does not normally plunge dive for fish like the other white terns, and has a broader diet than most other terns. It largely feeds on insects taken in flight, and also often hunts over wet fields and even in brushy areas, to take amphibians and small mammals. It is also an opportunistic feeder, and has been observed to pick up and feed on dead dragonflies from the road.

<doc id="363323" wikidata="Q308678" url="?curid=363323" title="Habilitation">
<text>Habilitation is the highest university degree, or the procedure by which it is achieved, in Germany, France, Italy, Poland and some other European and non-English-speaking countries. The candidate fulfills a university&#x27;s set criteria of excellence in research, teaching, and further education, which usually includes a dissertation. The degree, sometimes abbreviated Dr. habil. (), dr hab. (), or D.Sc. (&quot;Doctor of Sciences&quot; in Russia and some CIS countries), is often a qualification for full professorship in those countries. In German-speaking countries it allows the degree holder to bear the title PD (for ). In a number of countries there exists an academic post of docent, appointment to which often requires such a qualification. The degree conferral is usually accompanied by a public oral defence event (a lecture or a colloquium) with one or more opponents. Habilitation is usually awarded 5–15 years after a PhD degree or its equivalent. Achieving this academic degree does not automatically give the scientist a paid position, though many people who apply for the degree already have steady university employment.

==History and etymology==
The term &quot;habilitation&quot; is derived from the Medieval Latin , meaning &quot;to make suitable, to fit&quot;, from Classical Latin &quot;fit, proper, skillful&quot;. The degree developed in the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation in the seventeenth century (). Initially, habilitation was synonymous with &quot;doctoral qualification&quot;. The term became synonymous with &quot;post-doctoral qualification&quot; in Germany in the 19th century &quot;when holding a doctorate seemed no longer sufficient to guarantee a proficient transfer of knowledge to the next generation&quot;. Afterwards, it became normal in the German university system to write two doctoral theses: the inaugural thesis (), completing a course of study, and the habilitation thesis (), which opens the road to a professorship.

==Prevalence==

Habilitation qualifications exist or existed in:
* Algeria (, &quot;accreditation to supervise research&quot;, abbreviated HDR)
* Armenia, Azerbaijan (; currently abolished and no longer conferred, but those who have earned the degree earlier will use it for life)

* Slovakia ()
* Slovenia ()

* Sweden ()
* Switzerland ( and/or )
* Tunisia (, &quot;accreditation to supervise research&quot;, abbreviated HDR)

==Process==
A habilitation thesis can be either cumulative (based on previous research, be it articles or monographs) or monographical, i.e., a specific, unpublished thesis, which then tends to be very long. While cumulative habilitations are predominant in some fields (such as medicine), they have been, since about a century ago, almost unheard of in others (such as law).

The level of scholarship of a habilitation is considerably higher than for a doctoral dissertation in the same academic tradition in terms of quality and quantity, and must be accomplished independently, without direction or guidance of a faculty supervisor. In the sciences, publication of numerous (sometimes ten or more) research articles is required during the habilitation period of about four to ten years. In the humanities, a major book publication may be a prerequisite for defense.

It is possible to get a professorship without habilitation, if the search committee attests the candidate to have qualifications equaling those of a habilitation and the higher-ranking bodies (the university&#x27;s senate and the country&#x27;s ministry of education) approve. However, while some subjects make liberal use of this (e.g., the natural sciences in order to employ candidates from countries with different systems and the arts to employ active artists), in other subjects it is rarely done.

The habilitation is awarded after a public lecture, to be held after the thesis has been accepted, and after which the (Latin: &#x27;permission to read&#x27;, i.e., to lecture) is bestowed. In some areas, such as law, philosophy, theology and sociology, the , and thus the habilitation, is given only for certain sub-fields (such as criminal law, civil law, or philosophy of science, practical philosophy, etc.); in others, for the entire field.

Although disciplines and countries vary in the typical number of years for obtaining habilitation after getting a doctorate, it usually takes longer than for the American academic tenure. For example, in Poland until 2018, the statutory time for getting a habilitation (traditionally, although not obligatorily, relying on a book publication) is eight years. Theoretically, if an assistant professor does not succeed in obtaining habilitation in this time, they should be moved to a position of a lecturer, with a much higher teaching load and no research obligations, or even be dismissed. In practice, however, on many occasions schools extend the deadlines for habilitation for most scholars if they do not make it in time, and there is evidence that they are able to finish it in the near future.

===Austria===
In Austria, the procedure is currently regulated by national law (Austrian University Act UG2002 §103). The graduation process includes additionally to the sub-commission of the senate (including students representatives for a hearing on the teaching capabilities of the candidate) an external reviewer. Holding a habilitation allows academics to do research and supervise (PhD, MSc, ...) on behalf of this university. As it is an academic degree, this is even valid if the person is not enrolled (or not enrolled anymore) at this institution (). Appointment to a full professorship with an international finding commission includes a &quot;venia docendi&quot; (UG2002 §98(12)), which is restricted to the time of the appointment (UG2002 §98(13) – ).

While the habilitation ensures the rights of the independent research and the supervision, it is on behalf of the statute of the universities to give those rights also to, e.g., associate professors without habilitation. Currently the major Austrian universities do that only for master&#x27;s level students, but not for PhD programs.

=== Brazil ===
 is a title (similar to in Germany) granted to holders of doctorate degrees upon submission of a cumulative thesis followed by a &quot;viva voce&quot; examination. It has practically disappeared amongst Brazilian Federal HEIs. It is still required at a few institutions for admissions as a full professor (), most notably in the three state universities of the state of São Paulo, as well as at the Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP).

===France===

The degree of &#x27; (State Doctor) or &#x27; (State Doctorate), called (Doctor of Letters) or &#x27; (Doctor of Sciences) before the 1950s, formerly awarded by universities in France had a somewhat similar purpose. In 1984, the was replaced by the &#x27;.

The award of the French habilitation is a general requirement for being the main supervisor of PhD students and to be eligible for full professor positions. The official eligibility named is granted by the French (CNU). Members of corps who are assimilated to full professors by the CNU do not require the French habilitation to supervise PhD students. Depending on the field, the French habilitation requires consistent research from five to ten years after appointment as an associate professor (), a substantial amount of significant publications, the supervision of at least one PhD student from start to graduation, and/or a successful track record securing extramural funding as a principal investigator, as well as a sound, ambitious, and feasible five-year research project. Outstanding postdoctoral researchers who are not yet appointed to a university could also obtain the habilitation if they meet the requirements. The French habilitation committee is constituted by a majority of external and sometimes foreign referees. The French habilitation entitles associate professors () to apply for full professor positions ().

===Germany===

In order to hold the rank of a full professor (W3) within the German university system, it is necessary to have obtained the habilitation (or &quot;habilitation-equivalent achievements&quot;). This can be demonstrated by leading a research group, being a junior professor, or other achievements in research and teaching as a post-doctoral researcher. The habilitation in Germany is usually earned after several years of independent research and teaching, either &quot;internally&quot; while working at a university or &quot;externally&quot; as a research and teaching-oriented practitioner. Once the habilitation thesis (&#x27;, often simply &#x27;) and all other requirements are completed, the candidate (called in German) &quot;has habilitated him- or herself&quot; and receives an extension to his/her doctoral degree, namely &quot;Dr. habil.&quot; (with the specification, such as &quot;Dr. rer. nat. habil.&quot;). The habilitation is thus an additional qualification at a higher level than the German doctoral degree. Only those candidates receiving the highest (or second-highest) grade for their doctoral thesis are encouraged to proceed with a habilitation.

A typical procedure after completing the habilitation is that the successful researcher officially receives the so-called (Latin for &quot;permission for lecturing&quot;) for a specific academic subject at universities (sometimes also referred to as , Latin for &quot;right of teaching&quot;). Someone in possession of the &quot;&quot; but not a professorship has the right to carry the title &quot;Privatdozent&quot; (for men) or (for women), abbreviated &quot;PD&quot; or The status as a PD requires doing some (generally unpaid) teaching in order to keep the title ( or titular teaching).

===Italy===
In the Italian legal system, habilitations are different types of acts and authorizations.

====Habilitations for associate and full professorships in universities====
Regarding university habilitations, the so-called Gelmini reform of the research and university teaching system (Italian Law 240 of year 2010 and subsequent modifications) has established the national scientific habilitation for the calls in the role of associate professor and full professor (called , or ASN). This means that, as a prerequisite for being able to be selected by a university committee to fill these roles, it is necessary to have obtained the scientific qualification for the relative kind of teaching.
For STEM fields (so called &quot;bibliometric fields&quot;), the qualifications requires a two-step evaluation:

# first a quantitative assessment, as each candidate for and ASN as associate or full professor must have at least two out of these three requirements: having published more papers than most associate or full professors in Italian universities, having received more citations than most associate or full professors in Italian universities, having an &quot;h&quot;-index higher than most associate or full professors in Italian universities;
# then, a specific committee (one for each scientific sub-field) will qualitatively evaluate the scientific CV of the candidates, considering funding, mobility, autonomy of the research, awards won, and so on.

The successful candidate will then receive his or her ASN habilitation as associate or full professor (or, in some instances, for both) and may thus apply for those vacancies in Italian universities.

The ASN habilitation also allows to compete for three-year tenure-track assistant professorship positions (which were once called RTDb in the Italian system, for , and now are labeled as RTT, &quot;ricercatore in tenure-track&quot;). At the end of the three-year contract the assistant professor must have a valid ASN habilitation in order to become a permanent associate professor; otherwise, he or she is permanently laid off.
To prevent this (which may be disastrous to already undermanned Italian departments), it is common practice to award RTDb positions to people already habilitated as associate or full professors, which is in practical contrast with the spirit of the Gelmini-reform.

If an ASN habilitation application fails, the candidate can apply again, but only after a 12-month hiatus.

The ASN habilitation was initially valid for four years only, but this validity term was extended many times. It was first extended to six years, then 9 years, then 11 years (2023). Currently (2025), due to extreme scarcity of tenure track positions in Italy, the ASN habilitation validity has been increased to 12 years by yet another government decree in order not to let the first awarded habilitations expire (with consequent protests and possible lawsuits).

====Professional qualifications====

In the field of free regulated professions, protected by a professional body (architects, lawyers, engineers, doctors, pharmacists, journalists, etc.), it identifies the state examination, more properly called &quot;state examination for the qualification for the exercise of professions&quot; that allows already graduated students or those with the necessary titles to register on the list of professionals and work. Many state exams include the possession of a specific qualification among the requirements. For example, to take the habilitation exam for to become an architect or an engineer, one must have already graduated from a university. However, in order to actually practice the profession it is necessary to register with the relevant professional association and, if the profession is exercised independently, it is necessary to have a VAT number. These exams are usually organized by the professional orders with the collaboration of area universities.

In other cases, especially in the case of health professions or childcare professionals, not protected by a professional nature, the degree itself is a qualifying title.

Finally, some habilitations, since their activities cannot be done autonomously, need to be hired in a suitable structure in order to effectively carry out the profession in question. This is for example the case of the education sector: once the qualifying examination has been passed, a public competition must be won for recruitment in an upper or lower secondary school.

===Portugal===
In the Portuguese legal system, there are two types of habilitation degree. The first is normally given to university professors and is named &#x27; or Decree of Law 239/2007 while the second is named &#x27; (Decree of Law 124/99) and is used by doctoral researchers working in institutes outside universities. Legally, they are equivalent and are required for a professor () or a researcher () to reach the top of their specific careers (full professor or coordinator researcher). Both degrees aim to evaluate if the candidate has achieved significant outputs in terms of scientific activity, including activities in postgraduation supervision.

The process to obtain any of the degrees is very similar, with minor changes. Any PhD holder can submit a habilitation thesis to obtain the degree. For &#x27;, the thesis is composed by a detailed CV of the achievements obtained after concluding the PhD, a detailed report of an academic course taught at the university (or a proposed course to be taught), and the summary of a lesson to be given. For &#x27;, the academic course report is replaced by a research proposal or a proposal for advanced PhD studies.

After the candidate submits the habilitation thesis, a jury composed of five to nine full professors or coordinator researchers first evaluates the submitted documents; the majority needs to approve the candidate&#x27;s request. If approved, the candidate then needs to defend their thesis in a two-day public defense. The public defense lasts for two hours each day. On the first day, the curriculum of the candidate is discussed (for both degrees) and in the case of &#x27;, the candidate also needs to present the academic course selected. On the second day, the candidate needs to present a lecture (&#x27;) or a proposal of a research project (&quot;&quot;).

==Equivalent degrees==
The Doctor of Science in Russia and some other countries formerly part of the Soviet Union or the Eastern bloc is equivalent to a habilitation. The cumulative form of the habilitation can be compared to the higher doctorates, such as the D.Sc. (Doctor of Science), Litt.D. (Doctor of Letters), LL.D. (Doctor of Laws) and D.D. (Doctor of Divinity) found in the UK, Ireland, and some Commonwealth countries, which are awarded on the basis of a career of published work. However, higher doctorates from these countries (except Russia) are often not recognized by any German state as being equivalent to the habilitation. In 1999, Russia and Germany signed a Statement on Mutual Academic Recognition of Russian Academic Degrees and German Academic Qualifications, including the equivalence of the Russian Doctor of Science and the German Habilitation qualification.

Furthermore, the position or title of an associate professor (or higher) at a European Union–based university is systematically translated into or compared to titles such as (&quot;W2&quot;) (Germany), (Norway), or (Poland) by institutions such as the European Commission Directorate-General for Research, and therefore usually implies the holder of such title has a degree equivalent to habilitation.

==Debate==

===German habilitation debate===

In 2004, the habilitation was the subject of a major political debate in Germany. The former Federal Minister for Education and Science, Edelgard Bulmahn, aimed to abolish the system of the habilitation and replace it with the alternative concept of the junior professor: a researcher should first be employed for up to six years as a &quot;junior professor&quot; (a non-tenured position roughly equivalent to assistant professor in the United States) and so prove his/her suitability for holding a tenured professorship.

Many, especially researchers in the natural sciences, as well as young researchers, have long demanded the abandonment of the habilitation as they think it to be an unnecessary and time-consuming obstacle in an academic career, contributing to the brain drain of talented young researchers who think their chances of getting a professorship at a reasonable age to be better abroad and hence move, for example, to the UK or the USA. Many feel overly dependent on their supervising principal investigators (the professor heading the research group) since superiors have power to delay the process of completing the habilitation. A further problem comes with funding support for those who wish to pursue a habilitation, where older candidates often feel discriminated against, for example under the DFG&#x27;s Emmy-Noether programme. Furthermore, internal &quot;soft&quot; money might only be budgeted to pay for younger postdoctoral scientists. Because of the need to chase short-term research contracts, many researchers in the natural sciences apply for more transparent career development opportunities in other countries. In summary, a peer-reviewed demonstration of a successful academic development and an international outlook is considered more than compensation for an habilitation where there is evidence of grant applications, well-cited publications, a network of collaborators, lecturing and organisational experience, and experience of having worked and published abroad.

On the other hand, amongst many senior researchers, especially in medicine, the humanities and the social sciences, the habilitation wasand still isregarded as a valuable instrument of quality control before giving somebody a tenured position for life.

Bavaria, Saxony and Thuringia, three states with conservative governments, filed suit at the German Constitutional Court against the new law replacing the habilitation with the junior professor. The Court concurred with their argument that the Bundestag (the federal parliament) cannot pass such a law, because the German constitution explicitly states that affairs of education are the sole responsibility of the states and declared the law to be invalid in June 2004. In reaction, a new federal law was passed, giving the states more freedom regarding habilitations and junior professors. The junior professor has since been legally established in all states, but it is still possible—and encouraged—for an academic career in many subjects in Germany to pursue a habilitation.

<doc id="363325" wikidata="Q1324364" url="?curid=363325" title="Homogeneous space">
<text>In mathematics, a homogeneous space is, very informally, a space that looks the same everywhere, as you move through it, with movement given by the action of a group. Homogeneous spaces occur in the theories of Lie groups, algebraic groups and topological groups. More precisely, a homogeneous space for a group &quot;G&quot; is a non-empty manifold or topological space &quot;X&quot; on which &quot;G&quot; acts transitively. The elements of &quot;G&quot; are called the symmetries of &quot;X&quot;. A special case of this is when the group &quot;G&quot; in question is the automorphism group of the space &quot;X&quot; – here &quot;automorphism group&quot; can mean isometry group, diffeomorphism group, or homeomorphism group. In this case, &quot;X&quot; is homogeneous if intuitively &quot;X&quot; looks locally the same at each point, either in the sense of isometry (rigid geometry), diffeomorphism (differential geometry), or homeomorphism (topology). Some authors insist that the action of &quot;G&quot; be faithful (non-identity elements act non-trivially), although the present article does not. Thus there is a group action of &quot;G&quot; on &quot;X&quot; that can be thought of as preserving some &quot;geometric structure&quot; on &quot;X&quot;, and making &quot;X&quot; into a single &quot;G&quot;-orbit.

== Formal definition ==
Let &quot;X&quot; be a non-empty set and &quot;G&quot; a group. Then &quot;X&quot; is called a &quot;G&quot;-space if it is equipped with an action of &quot;G&quot; on &quot;X&quot;. Note that automatically &quot;G&quot; acts by automorphisms (bijections) on the set. If &quot;X&quot; in addition belongs to some category, then the elements of &quot;G&quot; are assumed to act as automorphisms in the same category. That is, the maps on &quot;X&quot; coming from elements of &quot;G&quot; preserve the structure associated with the category (for example, if &quot;X&quot; is an object in Diff then the action is required to be by diffeomorphisms). A homogeneous space is a &quot;G&quot;-space on which &quot;G&quot; acts transitively.

If &quot;X&quot; is an object of the category C, then the structure of a &quot;G&quot;-space is a homomorphism:
: formula_1
into the group of automorphisms of the object &quot;X&quot; in the category C. The pair defines a homogeneous space provided &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is a transitive group of symmetries of the underlying set of &quot;X&quot;.

=== Examples ===
For example, if &quot;X&quot; is a topological space, then group elements are assumed to act as homeomorphisms on &quot;X&quot;. The structure of a &quot;G&quot;-space is a group homomorphism &quot;ρ&quot; : &quot;G&quot; → Homeo(&quot;X&quot;) into the homeomorphism group of &quot;X&quot;.

Similarly, if &quot;X&quot; is a differentiable manifold, then the group elements are diffeomorphisms. The structure of a &quot;G&quot;-space is a group homomorphism into the diffeomorphism group of &quot;X&quot;.

Riemannian symmetric spaces are an important class of homogeneous spaces, and include many of the examples listed below.

Concrete examples include:
; Isometry groups
* Positive curvature:
*# Sphere (orthogonal group): . This is true because of the following observations: First, &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 is the set of vectors in R&quot;n&quot; with norm 1. If we consider one of these vectors as a base vector, then any other vector can be constructed using an orthogonal transformation. If we consider the span of this vector as a one dimensional subspace of R&quot;n&quot;, then the complement is an -dimensional vector space that is invariant under an orthogonal transformation from . This shows us why we can construct &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 as a homogeneous space.
*# Oriented sphere (special orthogonal group): 
*# Projective space (projective orthogonal group): 
* Flat (zero curvature):
*# Euclidean space (Euclidean group, point stabilizer is orthogonal group): 
* Negative curvature:
*# Hyperbolic space (orthochronous Lorentz group, point stabilizer orthogonal group, corresponding to hyperboloid model): 
*# Oriented hyperbolic space: 
*# Anti-de Sitter space: 

; Others
* Affine space over field &quot;K&quot; (for affine group, point stabilizer general linear group): .
* Grassmannian: 
* Topological vector spaces (in the sense of topology)
* There are other interesting homogeneous spaces, in particular with relevance in physics: This includes Minkowski space or Galilean and Carrollian spaces.

== Geometry ==
From the point of view of the Erlangen program, one may understand that &quot;all points are the same&quot;, in the geometry of &quot;X&quot;. This was true of essentially all geometries proposed before Riemannian geometry, in the middle of the nineteenth century.

Thus, for example, Euclidean space, affine space and projective space are all in natural ways homogeneous spaces for their respective symmetry groups. The same is true of the models found of non-Euclidean geometry of constant curvature, such as hyperbolic space.

A further classical example is the space of lines in projective space of three dimensions (equivalently, the space of two-dimensional subspaces of a four-dimensional vector space). It is simple linear algebra to show that GL4 acts transitively on those. We can parameterize them by &quot;line co-ordinates&quot;: these are the 2×2 minors of the 4×2 matrix with columns two basis vectors for the subspace. The geometry of the resulting homogeneous space is the line geometry of Julius Plücker.

== Homogeneous spaces as coset spaces ==
In general, if &quot;X&quot; is a homogeneous space of &quot;G&quot;, and &quot;H&quot;&quot;o&quot; is the stabilizer of some marked point &quot;o&quot; in &quot;X&quot; (a choice of origin), the points of &quot;X&quot; correspond to the left cosets &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;&quot;o&quot;, and the marked point &quot;o&quot; corresponds to the coset of the identity. Conversely, given a coset space &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;, it is a homogeneous space for &quot;G&quot; with a distinguished point, namely the coset of the identity. Thus a homogeneous space can be thought of as a coset space without a choice of origin.

For example, if &quot;H&quot; is the identity subgroup , then &quot;X&quot; is the &quot;G&quot;-torsor, which explains why &quot;G&quot;-torsors are often described intuitively as &quot;&quot;G&quot; with forgotten identity&quot;.

In general, a different choice of origin &quot;o&quot; will lead to a quotient of &quot;G&quot; by a different subgroup &quot;Ho′&quot; that is related to &quot;Ho&quot; by an inner automorphism of &quot;G&quot;. Specifically,

where &quot;g&quot; is any element of &quot;G&quot; for which . Note that the inner automorphism (1) does not depend on which such &quot;g&quot; is selected; it depends only on &quot;g&quot; modulo &quot;H&quot;&quot;o&quot;.

If the action of &quot;G&quot; on &quot;X&quot; is continuous and &quot;X&quot; is Hausdorff, then &quot;H&quot; is a closed subgroup of &quot;G&quot;. In particular, if &quot;G&quot; is a Lie group, then &quot;H&quot; is a Lie subgroup by Cartan&#x27;s theorem. Hence is a smooth manifold and so &quot;X&quot; carries a unique smooth structure compatible with the group action.

One can go further to &quot;double&quot; coset spaces, notably Clifford–Klein forms Γ\&quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot;, where Γ is a discrete subgroup (of &quot;G&quot;) acting properly discontinuously.

== Example ==
For example, in the line geometry case, we can identify &quot;H&quot; as a 12-dimensional subgroup of the 16-dimensional general linear group, GL(4), defined by conditions on the matrix entries
: &quot;h&quot;13 = &quot;h&quot;14 = &quot;h&quot;23 = &quot;h&quot;24 = 0,
by looking for the stabilizer of the subspace spanned by the first two standard basis vectors. That shows that &quot;X&quot; has dimension 4.

Since the homogeneous coordinates given by the minors are 6 in number, this means that the latter are not independent of each other. In fact, a single quadratic relation holds between the six minors, as was known to nineteenth-century geometers.

This example was the first known example of a Grassmannian, other than a projective space. There are many further homogeneous spaces of the classical linear groups in common use in mathematics.

== Prehomogeneous vector spaces ==
The idea of a prehomogeneous vector space was introduced by Mikio Sato.

It is a finite-dimensional vector space &quot;V&quot; with a group action of an algebraic group &quot;G&quot;, such that there is an orbit of &quot;G&quot; that is open for the Zariski topology (and so, dense). An example is GL(1) acting on a one-dimensional space.

The definition is more restrictive than it initially appears: such spaces have remarkable properties, and there is a classification of irreducible prehomogeneous vector spaces, up to a transformation known as &quot;castling&quot;.

== Homogeneous spaces in physics ==
Given the Poincaré group &quot;G&quot; and its subgroup the Lorentz group &quot;H&quot;, the space of cosets is the Minkowski space. Together with de Sitter space and Anti-de Sitter space these are the maximally symmetric lorentzian spacetimes. There are also homogeneous spaces of relevance in physics that are non-lorentzian, for example Galilean, Carrollian or Aristotelian spacetimes.

Physical cosmology using the general theory of relativity makes use of the Bianchi classification system. Homogeneous spaces in relativity represent the space part of background metrics for some cosmological models; for example, the three cases of the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric may be represented by subsets of the Bianchi I (flat), V (open), VII (flat or open) and IX (closed) types, while the Mixmaster universe represents an anisotropic example of a Bianchi IX cosmology.

A homogeneous space of &quot;N&quot; dimensions admits a set of Killing vectors. For three dimensions, this gives a total of six linearly independent Killing vector fields; homogeneous 3-spaces have the property that one may use linear combinations of these to find three everywhere non-vanishing Killing vector fields &quot;ξ&quot;,
: formula_2
where the object &quot;C&quot;&quot;a&quot;&quot;bc&quot;, the &quot;structure constants&quot;, form a constant order-three tensor antisymmetric in its lower two indices (on the left-hand side, the brackets denote antisymmetrisation and &quot;;&quot; represents the covariant differential operator). In the case of a flat isotropic universe, one possibility is (type I), but in the case of a closed FLRW universe, , where &quot;ε&quot;&quot;a&quot;&quot;bc&quot;is the Levi-Civita symbol.

He graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1974 with first class honours in mathematics and a Diploma in Computer Science with distinction (equivalent to a first-class master&#x27;s in computer science). He served in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) between 1971 and 1984, and attained the rank Brigadier-General, completing a Master of Public Administration degree at Harvard Kennedy School in 1980. Lee resigned from the SAF in 1984 to enter politics and was elected the MP for Teck Ghee SMC. Since its dissolution in 1991, he has represented the Teck Ghee ward of Ang Mo Kio GRC. 

Lee has served as deputy prime minister, minister for finance, minister for trade and industry, and second minister for defence under the two Prime Ministers Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong before assuming the office of prime minister in August 2004. In his first two years, his government enacted a five-day work week and extended maternity leave days. His proposal to build two integrated resorts in Singapore to increase tourism revenue led to the development of the Marina Bay Sands and Resorts World Sentosa. Following the Great Recession of 2008, he oversaw the country&#x27;s economic recovery within two years. Further political reforms in 2010 saw increased online activism, as well as the number of non-constituency members of parliament (NCMPs) in Parliament.

In between 2020 and 2021, Lee oversaw the government response to COVID-19 pandemic and its subsequent recession and recovery. In 2022, he also oversaw the government response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, making Singapore the only Southeast Asian country to impose sanctions on Russia. That same year, his government &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot; legalised same-sex sexual activity between men by repealing the then already unenforced colonial-era Section 377A. Lee was frequently noted by the international media as the world&#x27;s highest-paid state leader. His libel suits against journalists and political opponents had been frequently covered by international news outlets. In April 2024, Lee announced that he would not seek a sixth term as prime minister in the forthcoming general election and resigned from his position as prime minister in May alongside his cabinet; he was succeeded by Lawrence Wong, who formed a new cabinet and subsequently appointed Lee as a senior minister.

==Early life==
Lee Hsien Loong was born at KK Women&#x27;s and Children&#x27;s Hospital in Singapore on 10 February 1952, during the time when Singapore was a British colony. He is the eldest child of Lee Kuan Yew and Kwa Geok Choo and the patriline grandson of a retired storekeeper-turned-salesman, Lee Chin Koon (1903–1995) and Chua Jim Neo (1905–1980), a chef. His mother has ancestry from Tong&#x27;an District and Longhu while his father has ancestry from Dabu County in China.

===Education===
Lee was educated at Nanyang Primary School and Catholic High School—where he played clarinet in the school band, and National Junior College before he was awarded the President&#x27;s Scholarship and Singapore Armed Forces Overseas Scholarship in 1971 by the Public Service Commission (PSC) to study mathematics at Trinity College, University of Cambridge.

He became the Senior Wrangler at Cambridge in 1973, and graduated in 1974 with a Bachelor of Arts with first class honours degree (later promoted to Master of Arts by seniority) in mathematics and a diploma in computer science (now equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree in computer science) with distinction. His college tutor, Denis Marrian, later described Lee as &quot;the brightest mathematician he had admitted to the college&quot;. Béla Bollobás said that Lee &quot;would have been a world-class research mathematician&quot;, but his father did not realise this and persuaded Lee to leave the field. In an interview prior to Lee&#x27;s resignation as prime minister in 2024, Lee revealed that he did not regret on choosing to pursue the path of politics over mathematics, saying that he &quot;had the responsibility to come back to Singapore, be part of Singapore, and do what [he] could to help the country to succeed&quot;, which was &quot;the right thing to do&quot;.

He subsequently went on to complete a Master of Public Administration degree, becoming a Mason Fellow at Harvard University&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government in 1980.

===Military career===
Lee joined the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) in 1971, and served as a commissioned officer between 1974 and 1984, and held various staff and command posts, including Director of the Joint Operations and Plans Directorate, and Chief of Staff of the General Staff.

He also attended the United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth in 1978.

Lee rose quickly through the ranks in the Singapore Army, becoming the youngest brigadier-general in Singapore&#x27;s history after his promotion in July 1983 at the age of 32.

Notably, he was put in command of the rescue operations following the Sentosa cable car disaster. Lee served as commanding officer of the 23rd Battalion Singapore Artillery in the Singapore Army before he left the SAF in 1984 for politics.

==Early political career==
During the 1980s, Lee was regarded as the core member of the next batch of new leaders in the People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) leadership transition that was taking place in the mid-1980s, as Lee Kuan Yew had declared that he would step down as prime minister in 1984. Following the 1984 general election, all of the old Central Executive Committee members except Lee Kuan Yew resigned on 1 January 1985.

Lee was first elected Member of Parliament for the Teck Ghee SMC in 1984, at the age of 32. He was subsequently appointed Minister of State for Trade and Industry, and Minister of State for Defence.

In 1985, Lee chaired the government&#x27;s economic committee, which recommended changes to established government policies to reduce business costs, foster longer-term growth and revive the Singapore economy, which was experiencing a recession at the time. The committee&#x27;s recommendations included reductions in corporate and personal taxes and the introduction of a consumption tax.

In 1986, Lee was appointed Acting Minister for Trade and Industry. In 1987, he became a full member of the Cabinet as Minister for Trade and Industry and Second Minister for Defence.

===PAP Youth Committee===
In March 1986, First Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong discussed the question with Lee on encouraging younger Singaporeans to join the party. Goh was firm that the proposed committee should attract only the right kinds of members, ruling out material rewards as an incentive. The proposed youth wing was to encourage the improvement of the system from within, which would give new members a stake in the country&#x27;s future. Lee later said the establishment of the youth wing reflected concerns by the leadership that the lack of an official channel to engage with the younger generation might lead them to vote for opposition parties and potentially bring the PAP government down. The youth wing was an official &quot;tailor-made&quot; mechanism to allow dissenting opinions to be heard.

Lee was the first chairman of the PAP Youth Committee upon its establishment, the predecessor to Young PAP.

==Deputy Prime Minister==
===Ministerial duties===
On 28 November 1990, Goh Chok Tong succeeded Lee Kuan Yew as prime minister. Lee Hsien Loong was made one of two deputy prime ministers, along with Ong Teng Cheong. He continued to serve as the minister for trade and industry until 1992, when he was diagnosed with lymphoma. He subsequently relinquished his ministerial position and underwent three months of chemotherapy, though he continued to be a deputy prime minister during his illness. The chemotherapy was successful, and his cancer has gone into remission.

Lee was appointed chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in January 1998, and in 2001 he was made the finance minister. To ease the growing budget deficit due to falling tax revenues from cuts in corporate and personal income taxes and other factors such as the Iraq War and SARS outbreak, Lee proposed on 29 August 2003 to raise the GST from three per cent to five per cent, a change that took place in January 2004.

Lee initiated several amendments to render requirements for Singapore citizenship less restrictive, notably for foreign-born children of Singaporean women. The changes were made after repeated pleas from MPs and the Remaking Singapore Committee.

===Visit to Taiwan===
On 10 July 2004, Lee visited Taiwan, an island claimed by the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) that has been ruled by the Republic of China (ROC) since 1945. 
The Singapore government maintains a policy of neutrality in the Cross-Strait relations between the two sides despite having severed diplomatic relations with the Republic of China on 3 October 1990 in favour of the People&#x27;s Republic. To continue facilitating this policy when Lee becomes Prime Minister, Lee believed it to be important for him to &quot;personally feel for the situation&quot; in Taiwan and made the trip going to Taiwan. Ministry of Foreign Affairs officials advised that any visit to Taiwan by an incumbent prime minister would be diplomatically impossible, hence the trip was planned a month before Lee assumed the premiership and in his capacity as a private citizen, not as a government minister or as the head of government, with the PRC embassy informed on 9 July 2004. 

On the same day&#x27;s afternoon, the PRC government summoned the Singapore ambassador in Beijing and urged the cancellation of Lee&#x27;s trip, citing the likelihood of Chen Shui Bian&#x27;s administration in Taiwan exploiting the trip as a diplomatic coup and using it to promote the independence of Taiwan, with the PRC claiming that Singapore was making a &quot;historical error&quot; for the trip. Then-Foreign Minister S. Jayakumar replied to the PRC counterpart of him Li Zhaoxing that the ROC government had been asked to keep the visit low-profile and that it would proceed as planned.

The PRC later retaliated by cancelling several visits by high-ranking PRC officials to Singapore and delaying planned signing ceremonies, hinting that free trade negotiations would also be pushed back. The matter was further complicated and magnified when Taiwanese media headlined the visit and portrayed it as a diplomatic breakthrough, which raised tensions with the PRC. The Singapore government later published the full records of the discussion with the Chinese embassy in Singapore&#x27;s local media.

On 28 August 2004, in his first National Day Rally speech and as prime minister, Lee criticised some Taiwanese political leaders over their lack of understanding over the shifting balance of power across the Taiwan strait and Taiwan&#x27;s international position in their zeal for Taiwanese independence; and he criticised Taiwanese for capitalising on his private visit. He reiterated the reasons for the visit and said that Singapore&#x27;s decision to stand firm on its vital interests had earned it international respect. Relations were eventually mended when Lee met Hu Jintao at the APEC Economics Leaders&#x27; Meeting on 19 November 2004, which signified the end of the dispute.

==Prime Minister (2004-2024)==
===2004–2006: First term===
On 12 August 2004, Lee succeeded Goh Chok Tong as prime minister and relinquished his chairmanship of the Monetary Authority of Singapore to Goh. Chief Justice Yong Pung How had Lee sworn in at the Istana. As prime minister, Lee also became chairman of the People&#x27;s Association.

In his maiden National Day Rally speech on 22 August 2004, Lee announced several new initiatives, among them the policy of the &quot;five-day work week&quot; which removed the half-working day on Saturday. The plan took effect on 1 January 2005. In response to public feedback, maternity leave was also extended from eight to twelve weeks after consultation with employers and unions. To encourage the growth of the birthrate in Singapore, the Baby Bonus scheme was expanded to provide financial support to women who bear a fourth child.

In November 2004, Lee sparked a national debate when he proposed to build two Integrated Resorts (IRs), or hotel-casinos. Despite the longstanding stance against gambling in Singapore, with the exception of regulated industries such as the Singapore Turf Club and Singapore Pools, the government was concerned its stance was hurting the economic competitiveness of the country, risking the loss of tourism revenue to other cities. In April 2005, despite some public opposition, the government approved the proposal. The IRs were built in Marina Bay and Sentosa. To limit the negative social impact of casino gambling, Lee suggested safeguards such as prohibiting minors from the casinos and charging an entrance fee for Singaporeans of S$100 (or S$2000 for a yearly pass). The Casino Control Act was enacted into law on 1 June 2006, which regulated the operations of the casino operators and provided social safeguards intended to deter problem gambling.

In February 2006, Lee announced a S$2.6 billion &quot;Progress Package&quot; to distribute budget surpluses in the form of cash, top-ups to the Central Provident Fund, rental and utilities rebates, and educational funds. The cash bonuses were distributed in early May 2006. As the announcement came three months before the 2006 Singaporean general election, it drew criticism that the ruling party was involved in &quot;vote buying&quot;.

===2006–2011: Second term===
In that election, the PAP won 82 of the 84 seats, including 37 walkovers. The Ang Mo Kio GRC was contested for the first time in 15 years. The Workers&#x27; Party (WP) claimed that they wanted to give Ang Mo Kio residents a chance to exercise their vote. Lee and his six-member GRC team won 60.42% of the votes against WP&#x27;s inexperienced team.

On 29 November 2007, Lee announced that he would relinquish his finance ministerial portfolio to Tharman Shanmugaratnam on 1 December of that year. The handover was largely supported by business analysts, who felt that the importance of the position necessitated the dedication of a full-time minister for Singapore to entrench and promote its role as a financial hub. Regional economist Song Seng Wun said that with the growing sophistication of the economy and the financial markets&#x27; increasing volatility, Lee &quot;may not have the full-time attention&quot; due to his concurrent duties as prime minister.

====Great Recession====
The economy grew for the first two years of Lee&#x27;s tenure but plunged 12.5% during the Great Recession. Singapore became the first Asian country to slip into a recession during the fourth quarter of 2008, with the financial, construction and manufacturing sectors being particularly affected by the Great Recession; the downturn was attributed to the city&#x27;s trade-dependent economy. To counteract the ailing economy, the government announced a S$2.8 billion stimulus fund in November 2008 for SMEs and local firms and further pledged a S$20.5 billion Resilience Package in January 2009. These measures were intended to keep the unemployment rate low, having risen to 2.6% in December 2008 and 3.3% by the end of Q2 2009.

In August 2009, Lee declared that &quot;the worst [was] over&quot; and that Singapore was in a stronger position due to better-than-forecast growth in the manufacturing and services industries. The Ministry of Trade and Industry announced an end to the recession in November 2009 and forecast a 3–5% growth for 2010. Singapore subsequently saw a record-high economic recovery of 14.53%, defying predictions of moderate growth, with the unemployment rate falling to 1.8% by September 2010.

====Political reforms====
On 27 May 2009, Lee gave a speech in Parliament validating the roles of nonpartisan Nominated members of parliament (NMP) and praising the NMP scheme as having improved &quot;quality of debate&quot; in the-PAP dominated parliament. He proposed to make the scheme permanent. In May 2010, Lee instituted electoral reforms to the electoral system by reducing the number of group representation constituencies (GRC) and increasing the number of non-constituency members of parliament (NCMP) and nominated members of parliament (NMP) to a maximum of nine each (inclusive of the number of elected opposition members). A cooling-off day on the day before the election was instituted, where campaigning is prohibited except for party political broadcasts.

===2011–2015: Third term===
In the 2011 Singapore general election, the PAP saw a 6.46% swing downwards to 60.14%, its lowest since independence. The result, while a landslide victory for the PAP by international standards, was seen as a rebuke to the ruling party as a result of massive immigration of low-skilled workers, high-profile rail transport breakdowns and the rising cost of living in the intervening years. During the campaigning period, Lee has sensed the discontent in public sentiment and made a public apology. While the PAP swept into power, winning 81 out of 87 seats, it lost Aljunied GRC to the Workers&#x27; Party (WP), a historic win by an opposition party. Foreign Minister George Yeo and Minister in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office Lim Hwee Hua of the GRC were defeated. Following the election, Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong resigned from the cabinet as part of a rejuvenation process in the government and to provide a clean slate for Lee. Lee was sworn in to a third term on 21 May 2011.

On 1 June 2011, Lee was named chairman of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, which manages more than S$100 billion in assets. He succeeded his father, Lee Kuan Yew, who remained as senior advisor to the fund until his death.

In 2012, Lee indicated that he hoped not to be prime minister beyond the age of seventy, noting the need for someone to be in tune with the public.

===2015–2020: Fourth term===
In the 2015 Singapore general election, Lee was re-elected in Ang Mo Kio GRC, with the PAP winning 83 of 89 seats in Parliament and 69.9% of the national vote. Lee&#x27;s fourth term as prime minister was marked by events such as the China–United States trade war, which adversely affected the nation&#x27;s economy, being highly reliant on free markets and trade. Increased cyberattacks on Singapore-related services and websites led to the introduction of the Cybersecurity Act in 2018 and the establishment of the Cyber Security Agency. The defeat of the Barisan Nasional government in the 2018 Malaysian general election, which saw the return of Mahathir Mohamad as prime minister, led to a chill in relations as the new Pakatan Harapan government sought to overturn previously signed agreements on the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore high-speed rail and Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System, and also disputed with Singapore on airspace and maritime rights. As part of the Lee government&#x27;s effort to promote Singapore as an international center for arbitration, the city hosted the leaders of Mainland China and Taiwan for the Ma-Xi meeting on 7 November 2015 and the North Korea–United States summit on 12 June 2018. Singapore hosted the signing of the Singapore Convention on Mediation on 7 August 2019, the first United Nations treaty named after it, and ratified it on 25 February 2020.

On 20 July 2018, it was announced that sophisticated state-linked actors had hacked Lee&#x27;s health data along with that of 1.5 million other residents. The hack was intended to access Lee&#x27;s data in particular.

On 23 April 2019, Lee reshuffled his cabinet and promoted Heng Swee Keat to deputy prime minister, effective 1 May 2019. As part of the party&#x27;s leadership succession, the move was widely interpreted as a prelude to Heng succeeding Lee as Singapore&#x27;s fourth prime minister after the next general election. Lee noted that the cabinet reshuffle &quot;was more extensive than usual&quot;, with younger, fourth-generation ministers being prioritised and now heading two-thirds of the ministries.

====Planned GST hike to 9%====
Speaking at his party convention on 19 November 2017, Lee said that raising taxes was a necessity to fund investment in the social, healthcare, economic and infrastructure sectors. Annual expenses on preschools is expected to reach $1.7 billion by 2022, while the growth in the ageing population is predicted to create a larger demand for affordable healthcare. Construction and refurbishment of new port and rail infrastructure, coupled with economic restructuring and training of workers, also necessitated tax increases. The taxes raised would be in the form of the GST, which is expected to rise from 7% to 9% by 2025. Lee&#x27;s government said that it was necessary to plan ahead for increasing annual recurrent expenses, with Heng Swee Keat saying that the &quot;hike cannot be put off or scrapped&quot; to pay for critical future needs, especially in the healthcare sector.

In his Budget 2020 speech in February, Heng announced amendments to the GST Voucher Fund Act that would allow grants-in-aid to be given to parents or guardians for infants and children to mitigate their expenses. Second Minister for Finance Lawrence Wong said the intent was to expand the range of people who qualify for the fund. With the amendment, the Act would allow for the funding of the $6 billion Assurance Package, which was intended to delay the impact of the impending hike for five years.

The proposed hike met with broad disapproval from the opposition, with the Workers&#x27; Party and Progress Singapore Party calling for the GST to be retained at its present rate of 7% and others calling for the GST to be suspended entirely or for the exemption of essential goods from the tax.

====POFMA implementation====
Lee&#x27;s government introduced the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) in 2018, colloquially known as the &quot;fake news law&quot;, which was first mooted by Minister of Law and Home Affairs K Shanmugam. Despite concerns by activists and opposition Members of Parliament that the Act would limit free speech under the guise of preventing disinformation, the bill passed by a 72–9 vote on 8 May 2019 after two days&#x27; debate. Reporters Without Borders called the bill &quot;terrible&quot;, &quot;totalitarian&quot;, and a tool for censorship. Reuters wrote that the act &quot;ensnares&quot; government critics. Social media firms like Facebook expressed concern that the law would grant &quot;broad powers to the Singapore executive branch to compel us to remove content they deem to be false and pro-actively push a government notification to users&quot;. In the leadup to the 2020 general election, Lee&#x27;s own brother Lee Hsien Yang accused him of reneging on promises made in his 2004 National Day Rally speech about promising increased civil liberties and the freedom to express diverse views without interference.

Lee and his ministers actively rebutted allegations by overseas media that POFMA is a tool for censorship, saying that &quot;no information or view has been suppressed&quot; as a result of the Act and that the government &quot;has not restricted free debate&quot;. In an interview with &quot;The Straits Times&quot;, Lee noted that fake news could disrupt society, and that the United States and Europe were struggling to manage the situation, especially in light of alleged Russian interference in recent elections. He cited Germany as a country that has enacted a similar law. In response to concerns that POFMA could curb free speech, Lee said that free speech exists within appropriate boundaries, with no society having absolute freedom of speech, and that defamatory or threatening speech should be banned to facilitate meaningful exchange of information and ideals.

====Response to COVID-19 pandemic====
The first COVID-19 case in Singapore was confirmed on 23 January 2020. Early cases were primarily imported until local transmission began to develop. By late March, clusters were detected at multiple dormitories for foreign workers, which soon contributed to an overwhelming number of new cases in the country. In response, Lee announced on 3 April 2020 that Singapore would enter a limited lockdown with restrictions on movement. The policy, officially called &quot;circuit breaker&quot; in governmental parlance, was intended to halt the disease&#x27;s spread in the wider community. Workplaces were shut and all schools switched to home-based learning from 7 April to 1 June. Lee served as advisor to a multi-ministry level task force that had been set up in January, chaired by Minister for Education Lawrence Wong and Minister for Health Gan Kim Yong. Lee&#x27;s government also contributed US$500,000 to support the World Health Organization. With the pandemic pushing Singapore into a recession, the government unveiled four successive stimulus packages intended to keep the economy afloat, the &quot;Unity&quot;, &quot;Resilience&quot;, &quot;Solidarity&quot; and &quot;Fortitude&quot; budgets.

===2020–2024: Fifth term===
Following the 2020 Singapore general election, Lee was re-elected in Ang Mo Kio GRC, with the PAP securing 61.23% of the national vote, beginning his fifth successive term as prime minister. The election was widely seen as a setback for the ruling party, with the opposition Workers&#x27; Party capturing a second GRC.

While noting that voters had delivered a clear mandate, Lee wrote in a letter to the party (&quot;rules of prudence&quot;) that with the official appointment of a leader of the opposition to reflect ground sentiments for alternative ideals, PAP MPs should expect more vigorous debates and probing questions in Parliament. He encouraged party MPs to express their views honestly on proposed policies regardless of their party affiliation, while instructing them to defend their convictions and engage the opposition constructively. As a recognition of the Workers&#x27; Party&#x27;s performance in the election and acknowledgement of society&#x27;s desire for alternative ideas and more robust debate, Lee appointed Pritam Singh as the first official Leader of the Opposition.

Following the election, Lee announced a delay to his planned retirement in 2022 at his 70th birthday, given the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lee attended the Pacific Alliance summit on 11 December 2020 following three years of negotiations with the Latin American trade bloc on the Pacific Alliance-Singapore free trade agreement (PASFTA), with the PASFTA due to be signed in 2021. In 2022, his government strongly opposed Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine due to concerns of the territorial integrity of smaller nations around the world – the only country in Southeast Asia to openly condemn and sanction the Eurasian country.

On 21 August 2022, Lee announced during his annual National Day Rally as prime minister that his government intends to repeal the colonial-era Section 377A of the Penal Code, an unenforced law that criminalised sex between consenting male adults, effectively ending criminalisation both &quot;de facto&quot; and &quot;de jure&quot;. The announcement was celebrated by the LGBT community in Singapore, while adding that this will be the &quot;first step on a long road towards full equality&quot;. During the 2023 National Day Rally speech, Lee indicated a resumption of his succession plan, indicating Lawrence Wong as his likely successor as prime minister.

On 5 November 2023, Lee announced that he would hand over the role of prime minister role to Lawrence Wong by November 2024, before the next General Election which is due by November 2025. The handover ultimately occurred on 15 May 2024. He remains the Secretary-General of the PAP after the handover until the next PAP Central Executive Committee (CEC) meeting.

==Senior Minister (2024–present)==
Lee tendered his resignation as prime minister alongside his cabinet to President Tharman Shanmugaratnam on 13 May 2024, with effect from 15 May 2024. Lee was subsequently appointed as senior minister by Lee&#x27;s successor Lawrence Wong in his new cabinet while remaining as the chairman of the Research, Innovation and Enterprise Council on 15 May 2024.

==Foreign policy==
===China===
The Lee government&#x27;s policy towards the People&#x27;s Republic of China has been marked by extensive cooperation in government-to-government projects such as the Suzhou Industrial Park, Tianjin Eco-City and Chongqing Connectivity Initiative. The China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, the first of any Asian country with China, came into effect in 2009 and was upgraded in 2018, with new regulations governing e-commerce, fair competition and the environment; Singaporean firms were also granted greater access to Chinese markets, including the legal sector, which has been denied to other nations. Under Lee&#x27;s government, Singapore has been the largest investor in China&#x27;s Belt and Road Initiative and one of its earliest proponents, having signed a memorandum of understanding in April 2018. In April 2019, it agreed to further cooperation in trade and law enforcement, with Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing and Shanghai Mayor Ying Yong formalising plans on the formation of the Singapore-Shanghai Comprehensive Cooperation Council, which will be managed on the ministerial level. China has been Singapore&#x27;s largest trading partner since 2013, with trade reaching US$137.1 billion in 2017.

Bilateral relations between the two nations under Lee and the Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping administrations have been called strong. Lee&#x27;s government formally adheres to the One-China policy, most recently reiterating the principle governing its relations with Taiwan in January 2020, despite the pro-independence Tsai Ing-wen administration&#x27;s refusal to recognise the 1992 consensus. In spite of Chinese pressure and repeated offers of Hainan as an alternative site, Singapore continues to regularly send troops to train in Taiwan under &quot;Project Starlight&quot; and expects Beijing to respect its right to do so. Relations between the two nations cooled in 2016 after Singapore expressed its support on the ruling of the South China Sea arbitration case by the Permanent Court of Arbitration between China and the Philippines, which had dismissed Chinese claims to &quot;historical rights&quot; to the sea; Singapore views the surrounding seas as its lifeline and is sensitive to any attempts at hegemony. On 23 November 2016, the Customs and Excise Department of Hong Kong seized nine Singapore Armed Forces military vehicles at the Port of Hong Kong, which had been en route from Taiwan to Singapore after a military training exercise, in what became known as the &quot;Terrex incident&quot;. Both sides downplayed the incident and official responses were described as &quot;relatively muted&quot;, but international and local observers widely interpreted the seizure as a warning to Singapore. The detained vehicles were eventually released in January 2017 after it was officially deemed a customs import violation. Singapore has since sought to improve its relations with China, signing a defence agreement in October 2019 to enlarge military exercises with the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, provide mutual logistics support, and increase exchanges between the two armed forces.

===United States===

Singapore has a close defence and political relationship with the United States and is one of its strongest bilateral partners in Southeast Asia. The US is an important arms supplier to Singapore, with US$7.34 billion in active sales under the Foreign Military Sales system as of 2020. Singapore has traditionally viewed the US as a critical guarantor of stability and security in the Asia-Pacific region and Lee&#x27;s government has continued that policy, emphasising the US&#x27;s role as an important counterweight to the rise of China and its increasing military prowess.


The two nations have a defence pact dating to the 1990 memorandum of understanding (MoU), which allowed US access to Singapore&#x27;s air and naval bases and established the Logistics Group Western Pacific at Sembawang Terminal. On 12 July 2005, Lee and President George W. Bush signed the Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA), which recognised Singapore as a &quot;Major Security Cooperation Partner&quot;. The two nations agreed to address the threats of terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, while also furthering defence and security cooperation. Under the Barack Obama administration&#x27;s Pivot to Asia strategy, the United States Navy has completed multiple littoral combat ship deployments to Singapore since 2014. In December 2015, the SFA was upgraded when Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen and Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter signed the Defence Cooperation Agreement, which expanded cooperation to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, cyber defence, biosecurity and public communications. US P-8A Poseidon surveillance planes were also based in Singapore for the first time, which analysts said was a response to China&#x27;s actions in the South China Sea, with Lee reiterating Singapore&#x27;s commitment to &quot;defend the rights of freedom of navigation and overflight&quot;. In support of the US military intervention against ISIS, the Republic of Singapore Air Force has also contributed aerial refuelling and logistical support to Operation Inherent Resolve. In September 2019, a year before the 1990 MoU&#x27;s expiry, Lee and the Donald Trump administration renewed it for another 15 years.

The United States is Singapore&#x27;s largest foreign investor, with US$15 billion invested in 2017 and stock reaching US$274.3 billion. The Singapore-United States Free Trade Agreement was implemented in January 2004, with trade reaching $45 billion in 2016. Lee was one of the early drafters and a strong advocate of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was intended to lower both non-tariff and tariff barriers to trade and establish an investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) mechanism, and on many occasions urged the U.S. Congress to ratify the deal as soon as possible, adding that not to do so would &quot;affect U.S. standing and credibility&quot; in the world. Fitch analyst Andrew Colquhoun said that membership in the pact would have given Singapore an advantage over Hong Kong&#x27;s close links to China. As a country dependent on free trade, it was &quot;vital&quot; that Singapore retain a seat at the negotiating table. The agreement was ultimately not ratified after Trump became president in 2017 and pulled the US out of the pact.

Malaysia has had six prime ministers and four changes of government since Lee became prime minister in 2004. Lee has sought to improve relations with Malaysia after decades of acrimony by enhancing the countries&#x27; economic integration and infrastructural links. Since 2010, Lee has attended the annual Leaders&#x27; Retreat set for the two countries&#x27; leaders to discuss issues and enhance the dispute resolution mechanism. But bilateral relations remain complex and fraught with occasional disputes involving water supply, land reclamation, and airspace and maritime territorial claims. To avoid harming the relationship, efforts have been made to isolate unresolved disputes from cross-border cooperation tackling transnational crime, terrorism and drug trafficking; this has resulted in close collaboration between Singapore&#x27;s and Malaysia&#x27;s police and security agencies.

In May 2007, Lee agreed with Abdullah Badawi&#x27;s government to invest in the Iskandar Malaysia project and assist in building a tourism and industrial zone; the project was seen as a complement to the Singaporean economy and a strategy for Singapore to expand economically into its immediate hinterland, with RM20.57 billion invested as of 2019. In September 2010, Lee and Prime Minister Najib Razak resolved the longstanding KTM railway land dispute, with Malaysia agreeing to vacate a railway line cutting through the island to Tanjong Pagar railway station in exchange for land parcels in the Central Business District and Marina South, to be managed jointly. With the expiration of the 1961 Water Agreement in August 2011, Singapore handed the Skudai and Gunung Pulai water treatment plants over to the Johor state government, marking the end of one of two water agreements. To ease congestion on the Johor–Singapore Causeway, which links the two countries, Lee revived a dormant 1991 plan to link the Singapore MRT network to Johor Bahru in 2011. During this period, Malaysia also reinstated a plan to connect Kuala Lumpur to Singapore via a high-speed rail network. After joint preliminary technical studies on both rail projects, it was agreed to proceed with the Kuala Lumpur–Singapore high-speed rail (KL-SG HSR) in February 2013 and the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (JB-SG RTS) in December 2016.

After the 2018 Malaysian general election and the fall of the Barisan Nasional government, the Mahathir Mohamad government repeatedly delayed the rail projects, citing their high cost and its financial indebtedness. Lee reiterated the legally binding nature of the joint projects, which stipulated compensation to Singapore in the event of a cancellation, but nevertheless acceded to Malaysia&#x27;s request for an extension to conduct a review. In October 2018, tensions rose when Malaysia extended its Johor Bahru port limits past its 1979 maritime claims into undelimited waters off Singapore&#x27;s reclaimed Tuas sector. The maritime dispute occurred in conjunction with the Pasir Gudang airspace dispute, which began in early December; the airspace is under Malaysian sovereignty but was previously delegated to Singapore to manage in a 1973 agreement. In April 2019, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan and his counterpart Anthony Loke reached a joint agreement to revert to the previous status quo on both disputes. The 2020 Malaysian political crisis resulted in the Pakatan Harapan government&#x27;s collapse and the appointment of Muhyiddin Yassin as prime minister. Singapore has since worked closely with Malaysia to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In July 2020, Lee and Muhyiddin formally agreed to recommence the JB-SG RTS project in a signing ceremony on the causeway. 

On 6 May 2022, Lee alongside his wife visited the Malaysian state of Johor and attended a Johor state award investiture ceremony at the invitation of the Sultan of Johor. Lee was appointed Grand Commander of the Order of the Crown of Johor (First Class), the highest honour awarded in the State of Johor while his wife was appointed Grand Commander of the Order of Sultan Ibrahim of Johor, being the first Singaporean to be appointed to this order at this class. Lee made another visit to Johor alongside his cabinet ministers on 11 January 2024 to attend a commemorative ceremony for the Johor Bahru-Singapore Rapid Transit System (RTS) Link project and witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding on the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (JS-SEZ).
== Controversies ==

===Condominium rebates===

In 1996, while serving as deputy prime minister, Lee and his father Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew addressed Parliament on the allegations of receiving special discounts on four luxury condominium units that they had purchased from Hotel Properties Limited (HPL) on the properties of Nassim Jade and Scotts 28 in 1994 and 1995 respectively. Lee Kuan Yew&#x27;s brother Lee Suan Yew was the director of HPL, leading to the controversy. Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong ordered an immediate investigation into the matter, since although the provision of special discounts or rebates to relatives and associates of directors is permitted under Singapore law, shareholders must approve such transactions.

===Ministerial salary===
Lee&#x27;s salary has been a source of public discontent. From 2008 to 2012, Lee received an annual salary of S$3,870,000 (US$2,856,930), an increase of 25% from the previous S$3,091,200 (US$2,037,168). In January 2012, due to public discontent, Lee took a 28% pay cut, reducing his salary to S$2.2 million (US$1.7 million). He remained the highest-paid head of government in the world until his resignation as prime minister in 2024.

===Allegations of nepotism===
In 2010, Lee, together with his predecessors, threatened legal action against The New York Times Company, which owns the &quot;International Herald Tribune,&quot; regarding an op-ed piece titled &quot;All in the Family&quot; of 15 February 2010 by Philip Bowring, a freelance columnist and former editor of the &quot;Far Eastern Economic Review&quot;. The &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; apologised in March that readers of the article may &quot;infer that the younger Lee did not achieve his position through merit&quot;. The New York Times Company and Bowring agreed to pay S$60,000 to Lee, S$50,000 to Lee Kuan Yew and S$50,000 to Goh (amounting to about US$114,000 at the time), in addition to legal costs. The case stemmed from a 1994 settlement between the three Singaporean leaders and the paper about an article also by Bowring that referred to &#x27;dynastic politics&#x27; in East Asian countries, including Singapore. In that settlement, Bowring agreed not to say or imply that the younger Lee had attained his position through nepotism.

In response, media rights watchdog Reporters Without Borders wrote an open letter urging Lee and other top Singapore government officials to stop taking &quot;libel actions&quot; against journalists. Legal action had been taken in the Singapore courts for defamation against the &quot;Financial Times&quot; (2007) and the New York Times Company. In a 2008 report, the International Bar Association Human Rights Institute cast doubts on the independence of the judiciary in cases involving PAP litigants or interests.

As the eldest son of Lee Kuan Yew, Lee&#x27;s career has been shadowed by allegations of nepotism. He was widely tipped to be prime minister with several critics viewing Goh Chok Tong as a seat-warmer. Lee has challenged his critics to prove their allegations of nepotism or put the matter to rest.

===Oxley Road house dispute===

In June 2017, Lee became embroiled in a dispute with his brother Lee Hsien Yang and sister Lee Wei Ling, over the fate of their father&#x27;s house at 38 Oxley Road. Founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew was averse to a cult of personality. As a result, he had inserted in his final will a demolition clause stating that the house was to be torn down when his daughter moves out; it also states that should demolition be impossible, the house shall be closed to the public.

Lee&#x27;s siblings alleged that he was abusing his powers, using &quot;organs of the state&quot; as prime minister to preserve the house against their father&#x27;s wishes. Lee and the Cabinet denied all their allegations and convened a special sitting of Parliament to debate the matter thoroughly. In his closing speech, Lee stated: &quot;After two days of debate, nobody has stood behind these [his siblings&#x27;] allegations or offered any evidence, not even opposition MPs ... It shows that the Government and I have acted properly and with due process.&quot; He left open options to convene a select committee or Commission of Inquiry should substantive evidence be presented. The siblings accepted Lee&#x27;s offer to settle the dispute in private the following day.

On 1 September 2019, Lee sent a letter, via the Prime Minister Office, to journalist Terry Xu of The Online Citizen (TOC) requesting that Xu take down a TOC article with false allegations. On 5 September, Lee sued Xu for repeating statements made by Lee&#x27;s siblings. By doing so, Lee attracted critics for using the prime minister&#x27;s office for personal matters.

===1MDB defamation case===
In December 2018, Lee sued Leong Sze Hian, a prominent government critic, for sharing an online article on his Facebook page alleging that former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak had signed &quot;secret deals&quot; with Lee to secure help from Singaporean banks to facilitate money laundering from Malaysia&#x27;s government-run strategic development company 1Malaysia Development Berhad, in what became known as the 1MDB scandal. Lee&#x27;s lawyers claimed that Lee had been &quot;gravely injured in his character and reputation&quot; and &quot;brought into public scandal, odium and contempt&quot;. Leong removed the post thereafter but justified his actions by claiming that it was &quot;a matter of public interest... whether or not it was correct&quot; and filed a countersuit against Lee, claiming that the lawsuit proceedings against him were &quot;an abuse of the process of the court&quot;. The Court of Appeal dismissed the countersuit in September 2019, citing that Singapore law does not recognise the concept of the abuse of court process.

In October 2020, Lee took the stand in a four-day trial in the High Court against Leong, who was defended by lawyer Lim Tean, secretary-general of the opposition party Peoples Voice. In an opening statement, Lee&#x27;s lawyer Davinder Singh said that 1MDB had become &quot;a byword for corruption and criminal activity&quot; and that Leong&#x27;s sharing the post might have implied that &quot;Lee was complicit in criminal activity relating to 1MDB&quot;. Lee claimed that he was compelled to file the suit because not to do so would have raised questions, given his history of filing lawsuits against defamatory statements. Leong did not take the witness stand, with Lim arguing that it was unnecessary for Leong to give evidence, and that it was Lee&#x27;s responsibility to prove that Leong&#x27;s actions were malicious and had damaged Lee&#x27;s reputation. The case was adjourned to November 2020. Leong was found guilty in March 2021 of defamation and ordered to pay damages to Lee.

==Personal life==
Lee married his first wife, Wong Ming Yang, a Malaysian-born physician, on 20 May 1978. They have a daughter and a son, Li Xiuqi, born in 1981, and Li Yipeng, born in 1982. Three weeks after giving birth to their son, Wong died of a heart attack on 28 October 1982, at the age of 31.

Lee remarried to Ho Ching in 1985, a promising civil servant who subsequently became the executive director and chief executive officer of Temasek Holdings. They have two sons, Li Hongyi and Li Haoyi. Their elder son, Li Hongyi, was a commissioned officer in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), and is the deputy director of the Government Technology Agency. Their younger son, Li Haoyi, is a software engineer who authors books on the Scala programming language.

Lee was initially diagnosed with lymphoma, for which he underwent chemotherapy in the early 1990s. He subsequently underwent a successful robot-assisted keyhole prostatectomy on 15 February 2015 after being diagnosed with prostate cancer.

Lee is interested in computer programming and has written a Sudoku solver in C++ in his spare time.

<doc id="363328" wikidata="Q429430" url="?curid=363328" title="Symi">
<text>Symi, also transliterated as Syme or Simi (), is a Greek island and municipality. It is mountainous and has the harbour town of Symi and its adjacent upper town Ano Symi, as well as several smaller population centres, beaches and areas of significance in history and mythology. Symi is part of the Rhodes regional unit.

The economy of Symi was traditionally based on the shipbuilding and sponge industries. The population reached 22,500 at its peak during that period. Symi&#x27;s main industry is now tourism, and in 2021 its permanent population had declined to 2,603 with a larger population during the summer.

Symi is known for its unique shrimps. Named &quot;Symi&#x27;s shrimps&quot;, these are small and are pan fried and eaten whole, shell and all.

==Geography==

Symi is part of the Dodecanese island chain, located about north-northwest of Rhodes and from Piraeus, the port of Athens, with of mountainous terrain. Its nearest land neighbors are the Datça and Bozburun peninsulas of Muğla Province in Turkey. Its interior is characterised by small valleys, and its coastline alternates between rocky cliffs, beaches and isolated coves. 

Its main town, located on the northeast coast, is named Symi. The lower town around the harbour, is referred to as Yialos, and the upper town is called Horio or Ano Symi. Other townships are Pedi, Nimborio, Marathounda and Panormitis. Panormitis is the location of the island&#x27;s famous monastery which is visited by people from all over the world, and many Greeks pay homage to St Michael of Panormitis each year. The island has 2,603 inhabitants, mostly engaged in tourism, fishing, and trade. In the tourist season which lasts from Easter until Panormitis Day in early November, tourists and day-trippers increase the number of people on the island to as much as 6,000. 

In addition to its many historical sites, the island&#x27;s isolated beaches, many reachable only by small boats, are popular with tourists. The Municipality of Sými includes the uninhabited offshore islets of Gialesíno, Diavátes, Kouloúndros, Marmarás, Nímos, Sesklío, and Chondrós. Its total land area is .

==History==
In Greek mythology, Symi is reputed to be the birthplace of the Charites, and takes its name from the nymph Syme. According to a different account attributed to Mnaseas in Athenaeus&#x27; &quot;Deipnosophistae, Glaucus named the island after his wife Syme, when they settled the island. In antiquity, the island was known as Aigli and Metapontis. Pliny the Elder and some later writers claimed that the name was derived from &quot;simia&quot;, &quot;a monkey&quot;.

In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot;, the island is mentioned as the domain of King Nireus, who fought in the Trojan War on the side of the Greeks and was described as the most handsome man in the Achaean forces, after Achilles. Thucydides writes that during the Peloponnesian War there was a Battle of Syme near the island in January, 411 BC, in which an unspecified number of Spartan ships defeated a squadron of Athenian vessels.

Little is known about the island before the 14th century. Archaeological evidence indicates that it was continuously inhabited, and ruins of citadels suggest that it was an important location. It was part of the Roman Empire and later the Byzantine Empire, until its conquest by the Knights of St. John in 1309.

===Early modern: Hospitaller and Ottoman eras===
This conquest, fueled by the Knights&#x27; interest in shipping and commerce, launched several centuries of prosperity for Symi, as its location amidst the Dodecanese made it an important waypoint for trade until the advent of steam-powered shipping in the 19th century. In 1522, Symi was conquered by the Ottoman Empire, along with nearby Rhodes, but it was allowed to retain many of its privileges, so its prosperity continued virtually uninterrupted.

Under the Ottomans the island was called &quot;Sömbeki&quot;. Symi was noted for its sponges, which provided much of its wealth. It attained the height of its prosperity in the mid 19th century. Many of the colorful neoclassical mansions covering the slopes near the main city date from that period. Although Symiots took part in the Greek War of Independence of 1821–1829, it was left out of the new Greek state and remained under Ottoman rule.

===Modern era===

The island, along with the rest of the Dodecanese, changed hands several times in the 20th century. In 1912, the Dodecanese declared independence from the Ottomans to become the Federation of the Dodecanese Islands, though they were almost immediately occupied by Italy. The island was formally ceded to Italy in 1923, and on 12 October 1943 it was occupied by the Nazis. At the end of World War II, the surrender of German forces in the region took place on Symi to the British. The island was occupied by Britain for three years as a result. Symi was rejoined with Greece in 1948.

The island has become popular with tourists from abroad, especially British and Italians, and is now the permanent home of about 120 non-Greek residents, some 50 of whom are British. The influx of tourists has led to the restoration of a great number of homes, many of which were destroyed during World War II. These restorations, by law, have to conform to &quot;guidelines laid down by the Greek culture ministry&#x27;s Archaeological Service.&quot; Between 1998 and 2006, it is estimated that the price of a &quot;ruin&quot; on Symi increased fivefold. The growing population of EU expatriates has led to demographic as well as political changes, since EU citizens are allowed to vote in local elections and have attempted to exert influence on the island&#x27;s politics. Opinions on whether this is a sign of growing integration differ.

There has been considerable restoration of many houses in Symi in the past decade, by architects including Haris A. Kalligas and Anastasia Papaioannou, both winners of the Europa Nostra Awards for their work on Symi and elsewhere in Greece.

On 5 June 2024, British TV and radio presenter Michael Mosley went missing on the island while on holiday with his wife. After four days of searching, his body was found on 9 June, on the rocky slope outside the wall of a private resort called Agia Marina. It appeared that he had taken the wrong path sometime after leaving the town of Pedi.

==Culture==

===Landmarks===
* The Monastery of the Archangel Michael Panormitis is a Greek Orthodox monastery built on the southwest coast in the early 18th century. It overlooks a bay, and is still inhabited by monks.
* The Kastro overlooks the main town of Symi, Ano Symi. It was built by the Knights of St. John as an expansion of a Byzantine castle on the same site, many parts of which are still visible. There are remnants of an ancient citadel, on which the two later castles were built.
* The municipal clock tower which was built circa 1880
* The War memorial in the harbour consists of a monument, &quot;the Dove of Peace&quot;, in front of a bas-relief sculpture of a Trireme
* The town of Symi has thirteen major churches and dozens of chapels, some dating back to the Byzantine era.
* The village of Nimborio has surviving ancient Pelasgian walls and a set of twelve domes remaining from workshops used by artists.
* In late 2020 the renovated Historical Museum of Symi reopened. The collections include many artefacts found by the early 20th-century Symian antiquarians Michael and Niketas Chaviaras, sons of Demosthenes Chaviaras (1849–1922), himself an important figure in local historical research. In the 1980s, the Chaviaras family archive was donated to the museum.

===Festival===
Since 1995, Symi has hosted the Symi Festival during July to September. This festival was founded by Greek political journalist, Yannis Diakogiannis, who established it in the birthplace of his father Eleftherios C. Diakogiannis. Since its inception, it has attracted many Greek musicians, Katy Garbi, Eleftheria Arvanitaki, Glykeria, Alkistis Protopsalti, Dimitra Galani, Miltos Pasxahildis, etc., to perform at free open-air concerts in the main square of Yialos, and includes many dance and theatre events.

===Sister cities===
In 2008, Tarpon Springs, Florida, a town with a high percentage of Greek Americans, established a sister city-relationship with Symi. Located on the Gulf Coast of the United States, Tarpon Springs attracted many Greek sponge fishermen to Florida, for the &quot;sponge rush&quot; at the beginning of the twentieth century.

===Local media===
The island has one local amateur AM radio station, Radio Symi, broadcasting on 1485 kHz.

<doc id="363329" wikidata="Q34339" url="?curid=363329" title="Mark W. Clark">
<text>Mark Wayne Clark (1 May 1896 – 17 April 1984) was a United States Army officer who saw service during World War I, World War II, and the Korean War. He was the youngest four-star general in the US Army during World War II.

During World War I, he was a company commander and served in France in 1918, as a 22-year-old captain, where he was seriously wounded by shrapnel. After the war, the future US Army Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall, noticed Clark&#x27;s abilities. During World War II, he commanded the United States Fifth Army, and later the 15th Army Group, in the Italian campaign. He is known for leading the Fifth Army when it captured Rome in June 1944, around the same time as the Normandy landings. He was also the head of planning for Operation Torch, the largest seaborne invasion at the time.

On 10 March 1945, at the age of 48, Clark became one of the youngest American officers promoted to the rank of four-star general. Dwight D. Eisenhower, a close friend, considered Clark to be a brilliant staff officer and trainer of men.

Throughout his thirty-six years of military service, Clark was awarded many medals, the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC), the US Army&#x27;s second-highest decoration, being the most notable.

A legacy of the &quot;Clark Task Force,&quot; which he led from 1953 to 1955 to review and to make recommendations on all federal intelligence activities, is the term &quot;.&quot;

==Early life and career==
Clark was born in Madison Barracks, Sackets Harbor, New York, but spent much of his youth in Highland Park, Illinois, while his father, Charles Carr Clark, a career infantry officer in the United States Army, was stationed at Fort Sheridan. His mother, Rebecca &quot;Beckie&quot; Ezekkiels, was the daughter of Romanian Jews; Mark Clark was baptized Episcopalian as a cadet at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York.

Clark gained an early appointment to the USMA in June 1913 at the age of 17, but lost time from frequent illnesses. Known as &quot;Contraband&quot; by his classmates, because of his ability to smuggle sweets into the barracks, while at West Point, he met and befriended Dwight D. Eisenhower, who lived in the same barracks division and was his company cadet sergeant. Although Eisenhower was two years senior to him and had graduated as part of the West Point class of 1915, both formed a friendship. Clark graduated from West Point on 20 April 1917, exactly two weeks after the American entry into World War I, and six weeks before schedule, with a class ranking of 110 in a class of 139, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Infantry Branch. He graduated alongside young men such as Matthew Ridgway, J. Lawton Collins, (both of whom later became U.S. Army Chief of Staff) Ernest N. Harmon, William W. Eagles, Norman Cota, Laurence B. Keiser, John M. Devine, Albert C. Smith, Frederick A. Irving, Charles H. Gerhardt, Bryant Moore and William K. Harrison. All of these men would, like Clark himself, rise to high command and become generals.

Like his father, he decided to join the Infantry Branch. He was assigned to the 11th Infantry Regiment, which later became part of the 5th Division when it was activated in December, where he became a company commander in Company &#x27;K&#x27; of the 3rd Battalion, 11th Infantry, with First Lieutenant John W. O&#x27;Daniel serving as a platoon commander in his company. In the rapid expansion of the U.S. Army during the war, he rose quickly in rank, promoted to first lieutenant on 15 May and captain on 5 August 1917.

In late April 1918, shortly before Clark&#x27;s 22nd birthday and over a year after his graduation from West Point, he arrived on the Western Front, to join the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF). Arriving with his company at the French port of Brest on 1 May, his 22nd birthday, the next few weeks were spent in training in trench warfare under the tutelage of the French Army and soon afterwards the division was inspected by General John J. Pershing, the AEF&#x27;s Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C). Serving in the Vosges mountains, the Commanding Officer (CO) of the regiment&#x27;s 3rd Battalion, Major R. E. Kingman, fell ill and Clark was promoted to acting battalion commander on 12 June 1918, with O&#x27;Daniel taking over command of Clark&#x27;s company. Two days later, when Clark&#x27;s division was relieving a French division in the trenches, he was wounded by German artillery in the right shoulder and upper back, knocking him unconscious; the soldier standing next to him, Private Joseph Kanieski, was killed. They were two of the first casualties suffered by the 5th Division during the war.

Captain Clark recovered from his injuries within six weeks, but was graded unfit to return to the infantry, being transferred to the Supply Section of the newly formed First Army. In this position he served with Colonel John L. DeWitt, and supervised the daily provision of food for the men of the First Army, which earned Clark recognition at the higher levels of command. He stayed in this post until the end of hostilities on 11 November 1918. He then served with the Third Army in its occupation duties in Germany and returned to the United States in June 1919, just over a year after he was sent overseas.

==Interwar period==
During the interwar period, Clark served in a variety of staff and training roles. From 1921 to 1924, he served as an aide in the office of the Assistant Secretary of War. In 1925, he completed the professional officer&#x27;s course at the US Army Infantry School and then served as a staff officer with the 30th Infantry Regiment at The Presidio in San Francisco, California. His next assignment was as a training instructor to the Indiana Army National Guard, in which he was promoted to major on 14 January 1933, more than 15 years after his promotion to captain.

Major Clark served as a deputy commander of the Civilian Conservation Corps district in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1935–1936, between tours at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School in 1935 and the U.S. Army War College in 1937. Among his classmates there were Matthew Ridgway, Walter Bedell Smith and Geoffrey Keyes, all of whom he would serve with during World War II.

Assigned to Fort Lewis, Washington, Clark was selected by General George C. Marshall, the newly promoted Army Chief of Staff, to instruct at the U.S. Army War College in March 1940, where he received a promotion to lieutenant colonel on 1 July. Clark and Brigadier General Lesley J. McNair, later the commander of Army Ground Forces, selected the thousands of acres of unused land in Louisiana for military maneuvers in the Louisiana Maneuvers. On 4 August 1941, Clark, skipping the rank of colonel, was promoted two grades to the temporary rank of brigadier general as the U.S. Army geared up for entry into World War II, and made Assistant Chief of Staff (G-3) at General Headquarters, United States Army, in Washington, D.C.

==World War II==
In January 1942, a month after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the American entry into World War II, Clark was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff of Army Ground Forces (AGF), commanded by Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair, and in May 1942 became its Chief of Staff.

===Service in Europe and North Africa===
On 17 April 1942, Clark was temporarily promoted to the two-star rank of major general. Two weeks before his 46th birthday he was the youngest major general in the U.S. Army. In June, Clark, along with Major General Dwight Eisenhower, was sent to England as Commanding General (CG) of II Corps, and the next month moved up to CG, Army Forces in the European Theater of Operations (ETO). Along with Eisenhower, he was sent to work out the feasibility of a cross-channel invasion of German-occupied Europe that year, based on the Germany first strategy which had been agreed on by American and British military and political leaders the year before if the United States were to enter the conflict. In England Clark first met the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, who was much impressed by Clark, referring to him as &quot;The American Eagle,&quot; along with General Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS, the professional head of the British Army), and Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery, then commander of the South Eastern Command. After a cross-channel invasion was ruled out for 1942, attention was turned to planning for an Allied invasion of French North Africa, given the codename of Operation Gymnast, later Operation Torch. In October, Clark was assigned to the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO) as deputy to Eisenhower, who was now the Supreme Allied Commander in the theater, relinquishing command of II Corps. Clark&#x27;s duty was to prepare for Operation Torch. Clark also made a covert visit to French North Africa (see Operation Flagpole) to meet with pro-Allied officers of the Vichy French forces.

===Fifth Army and service in Italy===
Eisenhower greatly appreciated Clark&#x27;s contributions. Clark, at the age of 46, was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant general on 11 November 1942, three days after the Torch landings. He was the youngest three-star general in the U.S. Army. On 5 January 1943, the United States created its first field army overseas, the Fifth Army, with Clark as its CG, although neither Clark nor Fifth Army saw service in the fighting in North Africa. Many officers, most notably Major General George S. Patton Jr., who was both older and senior to Clark, and was then commanding I Armored Corps, came to resent him, believing he had advanced too quickly. Patton, in particular, believed Clark was &quot;too damned slick&quot; and believed Clark was much too concerned with himself. In the presence of senior commanders Patton and Clark were friendly, although Patton, in his journal, wrote &quot;I think that if you treat a skunk nicely, he will not piss on you—as often&quot;, referring to Clark after both he and General Marshall, the Army Chief of Staff, visited Patton&#x27;s headquarters as the latter explained his plans for the upcoming invasion of Sicily. Clark, for his part, claimed he found it difficult to command men who had been his senior, and he proved reluctant to remove those commanders if they failed in battle. The Fifth Army&#x27;s initial mission was preparing to keep a surveillance on Spanish Morocco. His permanent rank was upgraded to brigadier general on 1 September 1943.

On 9 September 1943, the Fifth Army, composed of the U.S. VI Corps, under Major General Ernest J. Dawley—who was a decade older than Clark and about whom Clark had doubts—and the British X Corps, under Lieutenant General Sir Richard L. McCreery—to whom Clark later scornfully referred as a &quot;feather duster&quot;—under Clark&#x27;s command landed at Salerno (codenamed Operation Avalanche). The invasion, despite good initial progress, was nearly defeated over the next few days by numerous German counterattacks, and Major General Dawley, the VI Corps commander, was sacked and replaced by Major General John P. Lucas, who himself was later sacked and replaced after his perceived failure during Operation Shingle. Clark was subsequently criticized by historians and critics for this near-failure, blamed on poor planning by Clark and his staff. Despite this Clark was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC), the citation for which reads:

The Fifth Army, by now composed of five American divisions (the 3rd, 34th, 36th and 45th Infantry, along with the 82nd Airborne) and three British divisions (7th Armoured, 46th and 56th Infantry), operating alongside the British Eighth Army, under General Bernard Montgomery, subsequently advanced up the spine of Italy, and captured the Italian city of Naples on 1 October 1943, and crossed the Volturno Line in mid-October. Progress, however, soon began to slow down, due to German resistance, lack of Allied manpower in Italy, and the formidable German defenses known as the Winter Line, which was to hold the Allies up for the next six months.

During the Battle of Monte Cassino, Clark ordered the bombing of the Abbey on 15 February 1944. This was under direct orders from his superior, British General Sir Harold R. L. G. Alexander, Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the Allied Armies in Italy (AAI). Clark and his chief of staff, Major General Alfred Gruenther, remained unconvinced of the military necessity of the bombing. When handing over the U.S. II Corps position to the New Zealand Corps, under Lieutenant General Sir Bernard C. Freyberg, the Assistant Division Commander (ADC) of the U.S. 34th Infantry Division, Brigadier General Frederic B. Butler, claimed &quot;I don&#x27;t know, but I don&#x27;t believe the enemy is in the convent. All the fire has been from the slopes of the hill below the wall.&quot; The commander of the 4th Indian Infantry Division, Major General Francis Tuker, urged the bombing of the entire massif with the heaviest bombs available. Clark finally pinned down the Commander-in-Chief, Alexander, recounting that &quot;I said, &#x27;You give me a direct order and we&#x27;ll do it&#x27; and he did.&quot;

Clark&#x27;s conduct of operations in the Italian campaign is controversial, particularly during the actions around the German Gustav Line, such as the U.S. 36th Infantry Division&#x27;s assault on the Gari river in January 1944, which failed with 1,681 casualties in the 36th Infantry Division. American military historian Carlo D&#x27;Este called Clark&#x27;s choice to take the undefended Italian capital of Rome, after Operation Diadem and the breakout from the Anzio beachhead, in early June, rather than focusing on the destruction of the German 10th Army, &quot;as militarily stupid as it was insubordinate&quot;. Although Clark described a &quot;race to Rome&quot; and released an edited version of his diary for the official historians, his complete papers became available only after his death.

Clark led the Fifth Army, now much reduced in manpower, having given up both the U.S. VI Corps and the French Expeditionary Corps (CEF) for Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of Southern France (which Clark had always opposed), throughout the battles around the Gothic Line. For the offensive, Clark&#x27;s Fifth Army (now composed only of the II Corps—with the 34th and 85th Infantry Divisions—under Major General Geoffrey Keyes, and the IV Corps—with the 88th and 91st Infantry Divisions—under Major General Willis D. Crittenberger and the 1st Armored Division in reserve) was reinforced by the British XIII Corps, under Lieutenant General Sidney Kirkman. The initial stages went well until the autumn weather began and, as it did the previous year, the advance bogged down.

Early on the morning of 28 January 1944, a PT boat carrying Clark to the Anzio beachhead, six days after the Anzio landings, was mistakenly fired on by U.S. naval vessels. Several sailors were killed and wounded around him. Next month, during the air raid he ordered on Monte Cassino abbey, 16 bombs were mistakenly dropped at the Fifth Army headquarters compound then 17 miles (27 km) away from there, exploding yards from his trailer while he was at his desk inside. A few months later, on 10 June, he again narrowly escaped death when, while flying over Civitavecchia in a Stinson L-5, his pilot, Maj. John T. Walker, failed to see the cable of a barrage balloon, which embedded itself into one of the wings, forcing the plane into a rapid downward spiral around the cable. The plane broke free after the third time around, leaving the outer section of the wing behind. Miraculously, Walker managed to crash-land in an open meadow and the two men escaped uninjured. &quot;I never had a worse experience&quot; wrote Clark to his wife.

===15th Army Group===
In December 1944 Clark succeeded Alexander as commander of the AAI, renamed the 15th Army Group, and Alexander was made the Supreme Commander of the AFHQ in the Mediterranean, replacing Field Marshal Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, who himself was called to Washington to replace Field Marshal Sir John Dill as head of the British Joint Chiefs of Staff. Succeeding Clark as commander of the Fifth Army was Lieutenant General Lucian Truscott, who had previously commanded VI Corps and, before that, the 3rd Division. Clark was promoted to the four-star rank of acting general on 10 March 1945, aged 48, the youngest in the United States Army. His permanent rank was upgraded to major general on 7 October 1944.

Clark led the 15th Army Group throughout the final months of the Italian campaign, although no major offensives took place, due mainly to a critical shortage of manpower throughout the ranks of both the Fifth and Eighth Armies along with the worsening winter weather. After much retraining and reorganizing, Clark then led the army group in the final offensive in Italy, codenamed Operation Grapeshot, which brought the war in Italy to an end, and he afterwards accepted the German surrender in Italy in May and became Commander of the Allied Forces in Italy at the end of World War II in Europe.

==Post-war era==
Later in 1945, as Commander in Chief of US Forces of Occupation in Austria, Clark gained experience negotiating with communists, which he would put to good use a few years later. Clark served as deputy to the US Secretary of State in 1947 and attended the negotiations for an Austrian treaty with the Council of Foreign Ministers in London and Moscow. In June 1947, Clark returned home and assumed command of the Sixth Army, headquartered at the Presidio in San Francisco and two years later was named chief of Army Field Forces. On 20 October 1951, he was nominated by President Harry S Truman to be the US emissary to the Holy See. Clark withdrew his nomination on 13 January 1952, after protests from Texas Senator Tom Connally and from Protestant groups.

==Congressional inquiry==

It was announced on 20 January 1946 that the 36th Infantry Division Veterans&#x27; Association had unanimously called for a congressional inquiry into Clark&#x27;s actions during the 36th Infantry Division&#x27;s disastrous crossing of the Gari River (erroneously identified as the Rapido) on the night of 20 January 1944. The petition read:

Be it resolved, that the men of the 36th Division Association petition the Congress of the United States to investigate the river Rapido fiasco and take the necessary steps to correct a military system that will permit an inefficient and inexperienced officer, such as General Mark W. Clark, in a high command to destroy the young manhood of this country and to prevent future soldiers being sacrificed wastefully and uselessly.

Two resolutions were heard in the House of Representatives, one of which claimed the incident was &quot;one of the most colossal blunders of the Second World War... a murderous blunder&quot; that &quot;every man connected with this undertaking knew... was doomed to failure.&quot;

Clark was absolved of blame by the House of Representatives but never commented on the Rapido River episode.

==Korean War==

During the Korean War, he took over as commander of the United Nations Command on 12 May 1952, succeeding General Matthew Ridgway, a close friend and a fellow graduate of the West Point class of 1917. In this capacity he also served as Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, overseeing all U.S. forces in the postwar occupation of Japan. Clark commanded the UN forces in Korea until the armistice was signed on 27 July 1953, and retired from the Army on 31 October that year. He retained his position as SCAP and governor of the Ryukyu Islands until 7 October, when he was succeeded by John E. Hull.
===Later career===
From 1954 to 1965, after retiring from the Army, Clark served as president of The Citadel, the Military College of South Carolina in Charleston.

From 1954 to 1955, Clark was head of the Clark Task Force to study and make recommendations on all intelligence activities of the Federal government. The task force had been created in 1953 by the second Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government, or the Hoover Commission, which had been chaired by Herbert Hoover.

Members of the Clark Task Force were Admiral Richard L. Conolly, a former Deputy Chief of Naval Operations; Ernest F. Hollings, the speaker pro tempore of South Carolina&#x27;s House of Representatives; California businessman Henry Kearns; Edward V. Rickenbacker, World War I flying ace and president of Eastern Air Lines; and Donald S. Russell, a former Assistant Secretary of State. The staff director was Major General James G. Christiansen. The task force first met in early November 1954 and in May 1955 submitted a top-secret report for the president and another that was unclassified for the Hoover Commission and Congress. The Clark task force coined the term Intelligence Community to describe &quot;the machinery for accomplishing our intelligence objectives.&quot;
Clark wrote two memoirs: &quot;Calculated Risk&quot; (1950) and &quot;From the Danube to the Yalu&quot; (1954). His wife, Maurine, also wrote a memoir: &quot;Captain&#x27;s Bride, General&#x27;s Lady&quot; (1956).

In 1962, Clark was elected an honorary member of the South Carolina Society of the Cincinnati in recognition of his outstanding service to his country.

==Retirement and death==
General Clark retired in 1965 when he stepped down as president of The Citadel. He lived in Charleston, South Carolina, in retirement and died there on April 17, 1984, at age 87. He was the last surviving American officer who had held four-star rank during World War II. He was buried on the campus of The Citadel.

==Awards and decorations==
==Dates of rank==
==Personal life==
Clark married Maurine Doran, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. M. A. Doran of Muncie, Ind., 17 May 1924. Mrs. Clark died 5 October 1966. Their son was Maj. William Doran Clark, U.S.A. (Ret.), and their daughter Patricia Ann (Mrs. Gordon H. Oosting). Later in life he married Mary Dean. Patricia Ann did not have any children. William had 5 children: Louise Clark Goddard, Doran Clark Abrams, D&#x27;Wayne Clark Waterman, Helen Clark Atkeson, and Larry Clark.

Mark W. Clark was initiated to the Scottish Rite Freemasonry in the Mystic Tie Lodge No. 398, Indianapolis, IN, receiving the 33rd and highest degree.

==Legacy==
An interstate spur (I-526) in the suburbs of Charleston, South Carolina, was named Mark Clark Expressway in his honor.

Mark Clark Hall on the campus of The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina, is named in General Clark&#x27;s honor.

The General Mark W. Clark National Guard Armory in North Charleston, South Carolina, is named in Clark&#x27;s honor.

From 1949 to August 17, 2010, the Mark Clark Bridge in Washington connected Camano Island with the adjacent town of Stanwood on the mainland. It was then superseded by the Camano Gateway Bridge, and the Mark Clark Bridge was demolished the following month.

Fort Drum&#x27;s Clark Hall is named after him. Fort Drum is near Clark&#x27;s Madison Barracks birthplace, and Clark Hall is used for administrative in processing and out-processing soldiers assigned to the 10th Mountain Division.

The term &quot;intelligence community&quot; was created by the federal intelligence-review &quot;Clark Task Force,&quot; which he headed from 1953 to 1955. The term remains in use by the US government and by civilians.

He was used in the 1979 novel Kane and Abel as the reason for the Abel character going to World War II.

Two locations in the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro—the Academia Militar das Agulhas Negras in Resende, and a street in São Gonçalo—have been named after Clark.

The Agulhas Negras Military Academy Stadium, Brazil ( AMAN ), is named General Mark Clark.

In the neighborhood of Santa Catarina, in the city of São Gonçalo, located in the State of Rio de Janeiro – Brazil, there is a street called Gen. Mark Clark.

==In film==
Clark was portrayed by Michael Rennie in the 1968 film &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Brigade&quot;. The film is about the exploits of the 1st Special Service Force, commanded by Colonel Robert T. Frederick, which came under Clark&#x27;s command in the Italian Campaign.

Clark was portrayed by Robert Ryan in the 1968 war film &quot;Anzio&quot;, under the pseudonym “General Carson”.

Clark was portrayed by William Schallert in the 1979 television miniseries &quot;&quot;.

General Clark was referred to in the television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, season 11, episode 3: &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;. In the episode, he created a program that awarded an enemy soldier $100,000 and U.S. citizenship.

<text>Bycatch (or by-catch), in the fishing industry, is a fish or other marine species that is caught unintentionally while fishing for specific species or sizes of wildlife. Bycatch is either the wrong species, the wrong sex, or is undersized or juveniles of the target species. The term &quot;bycatch&quot; is also sometimes used for untargeted catch in other forms of animal harvesting or collecting. Non-marine species (freshwater fish not saltwater fish) that are caught (either intentionally or unintentionally) but regarded as generally &quot;undesirable&quot; are referred to as rough fish (mainly US) or coarse fish (mainly UK).

In 1997, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defined bycatch as &quot;total fishing mortality, excluding that accounted directly by the retained catch of target species&quot;. Bycatch contributes to fishery decline and is a mechanism of overfishing for unintentional catch.

The average annual bycatch rate of pinnipeds and cetaceans in the US from 1990 to 1999 was estimated at 6215 animals with a standard error of 448.

Bycatch issues originated with the &quot;mortality of dolphins in tuna nets in the 1960s&quot;.

There are at least four different ways the word &quot;bycatch&quot; is used in fisheries:
* Catch which is retained and sold but which is not the target species for the fishery 
* Species/sizes/sexes of fish which fishers discard
* Non-target fish, whether retained and sold or discarded
* Unwanted invertebrate species, such as echinoderms and non-commercial crustaceans, and various vulnerable species groups, including seabirds, sea turtles, marine mammals and elasmobranchs (sharks and their relatives).

Additionally, the term &quot;deliberate bycatch&quot; is used to refer to bycatch as a source of illegal wildlife trade (IWT) in several areas throughout the world.

There are several tools to estimate bycatch limits—the maximum number of animals that could be sustainably removed from a population impacted by bycatch.
These include the &#x27;potential biological removal&#x27; (PBR) and the &#x27;sustainable anthropogenic mortality in stochastic environments&#x27; (SAMSE), which incorporates stochastic factors to determine sustainable limits to bycatch and other human-caused mortality of wildlife.

== Examples ==

===Recreational fishing===
Given the popularity of recreational fishing throughout the world, a small local study in the US in 2013 suggested that discards may be an important unmonitored source of fish mortality.

===Shrimp trawling===


The highest rates of incidental catch of non-target species are associated with tropical shrimp trawling. In 1997, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) documented the estimated bycatch and discard levels from shrimp fisheries around the world. They found discard rates (bycatch to catch ratios) as high as 20:1 with a world average of 5.7:1.

Shrimp trawl fisheries catch two percent of the world total catch of all fish by weight, but produce more than one-third of the world total bycatch. US shrimp trawlers produce bycatch ratios between 3:1 (3 bycatch:1 shrimp) and 15:1 (15 bycatch:1 shrimp).

Trawl nets in general, and shrimp trawls in particular, have been identified as sources of mortality for cetacean and finfish species. When bycatch is discarded (returned to the sea), it is often dead or dying.

Tropical shrimp trawlers often make trips of several months without coming to port. A typical haul may last four hours after which the net is pulled in. Just before it is pulled on board the net is washed by zigzagging at full speed. The contents are then dumped on deck and are sorted. An average of 5.7:1 means that for every kilogram of shrimp there are 5.7 kg of bycatch. In tropical inshore waters the bycatch usually consists of small fish. The shrimps are frozen and stored on board; the bycatch is discarded.

Recent sampling in the South Atlantic rock shrimp fishery found 166 species of finfish, 37 crustacean species, and 29 other species of invertebrate among the bycatch in the trawls. Another sampling of the same fishery over a two-year period found that rock shrimp amounted to only 10% of total catch weight. Iridescent swimming crab, dusky flounder, inshore lizardfish, spot, brown shrimp, longspine swimming crabs, and other bycatch made up the rest.

Despite the use of bycatch reduction devices, the shrimp fishery in the Gulf of Mexico removes about 25–45 million red snapper annually as bycatch, nearly one-half the amount taken in recreational and commercial snapper fisheries.

===Cetacean===
Cetaceans, such as dolphins, porpoises, and whales, can be seriously affected by entanglement in fishing nets and lines, or direct capture by hooks or in trawl nets. Cetacean bycatch is increasing in intensity and frequency. In some fisheries, cetaceans are captured as bycatch but then retained because of their value as food or bait. In this fashion, cetaceans can become a target of fisheries.
One example of bycatch is dolphins caught in tuna nets. As dolphins are mammals and do not have gills, they may drown while stuck in nets underwater. This bycatch issue has been one of the reasons of the growing ecolabelling industry, where fish producers mark their packagings with disclaimers such as &quot;dolphin friendly&quot; to reassure buyers. However, &quot;dolphin friendly&quot; does not mean that dolphins were not killed in the production of a particular tin of tuna, but that the fleet which caught the tuna did not &quot;specifically&quot; target a feeding pod of dolphins, but relied on other methods to spot tuna schools.
The bycatch of the Caspian seal may be recognized as one of the biggest entanglements of pinnipeds as bycatch in the world 

===Albatross===

Of the 22 albatross species recognised by IUCN on their Red List, 15 are threatened with extinction, six species are considered as Near Threatened, and only one of Least Concern. Two species, the Tristan albatross and the waved albatross, are considered as Critically Endangered. One of the main threats is commercial longline fishing, because albatrosses and other seabirds which readily feed on offal are attracted to the set bait, after which they become hooked on the lines and drown. An estimated 100,000 albatross per year are killed in this fashion. Unregulated pirate fisheries exacerbate the problem.

A research study examined the impact of illegal longline fishing vessels on albatrosses, by using environmental criminology as a guiding theoretical framework. The results indicated that potentially illegal longline fishing activities are highly concentrated in areas of illegally-caught fish species, and the risk to bycatch albatrosses is significantly higher in areas where these illegal longline fishing vessels operate. These findings provide strong grounding that illegal longline fishing poses a particularly serious threat to the survival of seabirds.
===Sea turtles===

Sea turtles, already critically endangered, have been killed in large numbers in shrimp trawl nets. Estimates indicate that thousands of Kemp&#x27;s ridley, loggerhead, green, and leatherback sea turtles are caught in shrimp trawl fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico and the US Atlantic annually The speed and length of the trawl method is significant because, &quot;for a tow duration of less than 10 minutes, the mortality rate for sea turtles is less than one percent, whereas for tows greater than sixty minutes the mortality rate rapidly increases to fifty to one hundred percent&quot;.

Sea turtles can sometimes escape from the trawls. In the Gulf of Mexico, the Kemp&#x27;s ridley turtles recorded most interactions, followed in order by loggerhead, green, and leatherback sea turtles. In the US Atlantic, the interactions were greatest for loggerheads, followed in order by Kemp&#x27;s ridley, leatherback, and green sea turtles.
===Fishing gear===
Bycatch is inevitable wherever there is fishing. The incidental catch is not limited to only fish species: dolphins, sea turtles, and seabirds are also victims of bycatch. Longlines, trawls and purse seine nets are driving factors in the endangerment of no fewer than fifteen shark species. Bycatch may also affect reproduction of populations as juveniles are also victims of bycatch. Bycatch happens most commonly with the use of gillnetting, longlines, or bottom trawling. Longlines with bait hook attachments can potentially reach lengths of dozens of kilometres, and, along with gill nets in the water and bottom trawls sweeping the sea floor, can catch essentially everything in their path. There are thousands of kilometres of nets and lines cast into the world&#x27;s oceans daily. This modern fish gear is robust and invisible to the eye, making it efficient at catching fish and bycatching everything that happens to be in the way. Hook-and-line fishing could limit bycatch to a certain extent as the non-target animals can be released back to the ocean fairly quickly.

==Mitigation==

Concern about bycatch has led fishers and scientists to seek ways of reducing unwanted catch. There are two main approaches.

One approach is to ban fishing in areas where bycatch is unacceptably high. Such area closures can be permanent, seasonal, or for a specific period when a bycatch problem is registered. Temporary area closures are common in some bottom trawl fisheries where undersized fish or non-target species are caught unpredictably. In some cases fishers are required to relocate when a bycatch problem occurs.

The other approach is alternative fishing gear. A technically simple solution is to use nets with a larger mesh size, allowing smaller species and smaller individuals to escape. However, this usually requires replacing the existing gear. In some cases, it is possible to modify gear. Bycatch reduction devices (BRDs) and the Nordmore grate are net modifications that help fish escape from shrimp nets.

===Bycatch reduction devices===
BRDs allow many commercial finfish species to escape. The US government has approved BRDs that reduce finfish bycatch by 30%. Spanish mackerel and weakfish bycatch in the South Atlantic was reduced by 40%. However, recent surveys suggest BRDs may be less effective than previously thought. A rock shrimp fishery off Florida found the devices failed to exclude 166 species of fish, 37 crustacean species, and 29 species of other invertebrates.

A pulsed electric field-based shark and ray bycatch mitigation device, SharkGuard, was reported by 2022 study to have reduced bycatch of blue shark by 91% and of stingrays by 71% with commercial fishing gear in a French longline tuna fishery in the Mediterranean.

===Turtle excluder devices===
In 1978, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) started to develop turtle excluder devices (TED). A TED uses a grid which deflects turtles and other big animals, so they exit from the trawl net through an opening above the grid. US shrimp trawlers and foreign fleets which market shrimp in the US are required to use TEDs. Not all nations enforce the use of TEDs.

For the most part, when they are used, TEDs have been successful reducing sea turtle bycatch. However, they are not completely effective, and some turtles are still captured. NMFS certifies TED designs if they are 97% effective. In heavily trawled areas, the same sea turtle may pass repeatedly through TEDs. Recent studies indicate recapture rates of 20% or more, but it is not clear how many turtles survive the escape process.

===Conservation engineering of trawl nets===
The size selectivity of trawl nets is controlled by the size of the net openings, especially in the &quot;cod end&quot;. The larger the openings, the more easily small fish can escape. The development and testing of modifications to fishing gear to improve selectivity and decrease impact is called &quot;conservation engineering&quot;.
Longline fishing is controversial in some areas because of bycatch. Mitigation methods have been successfully implemented in some fisheries. These include:
* weights to sink the lines quickly
* streamer lines to scare birds away from baited hooks while deploying the lines
* setting lines only at night with minimal ship lighting (to avoid attracting birds)
* limiting fishing seasons to the southern winter (when most seabirds are not feeding young)
* not discharging offal while setting lines.

However, gear modifications do not eliminate bycatch of many species. In March 2006, the Hawaii longline swordfish fishing season was closed due to excessive loggerhead sea turtle bycatch after being open only a few months, despite using modified circle hooks.

===No discards policy===
One solution that Norway came up with to reduce bycatch is to adopt a &#x27;no discards&#x27; policy. This means that the fishermen must keep everything they catch. This policy has helped to &quot;encourage bycatch research&quot;, which, in turn has helped &quot;encourage behavioral changes in fishers&quot; and &quot;reduce the waste of life&quot; as well.

===Seabirds===
Seabirds get entangled in longlines by flocking around vessels, this eventually leads to drowning because they try to catch baits on the hooks. Fisheries had been using &quot;streamer lines&quot; as a cost effective solution to mitigate this type of bycatch, and it has dramatically reduced seabird mortality. These streamer lines have bright colors and are made of polyester rope, they are positioned alongside the longlines on both sides. Their bright colors and constantly flapping of water frightens the seabirds and they fly away before reaching the baited hooks. A successful example would be the use of streamer lines in Alaskan groundfish longline fisheries, as the deaths of seabirds declined by about 70% after the deployment of these lines.

==Alternative to discarding==
Some fisheries retain bycatch, rather than throwing the fish back into the ocean. Sometimes bycatch is sorted and sold as food, especially in Asia, Africa and Latin America, where cost of labour is cheaper. Bycatch can also be sold in frozen bags as &quot;assorted seafood&quot; or &quot;seafood medley&quot; at cheaper prices. Bycatch can be converted into fish hydrolysate (ground up fish carcasses) for use as a soil amendment in organic agriculture or it can be used as an ingredient in fish meal. In Southeast Asia bycatch is sometimes used as a raw material for fish sauce production. Bycatch is also commonly de-boned, de-shelled, ground and blended into fish paste or moulded into fish cakes (surimi) and sold either fresh (for domestic use) or frozen (for export). This is commonly the case in Asia or by Asian fisheries. Sometimes bycatch is sold to fish farms to feed farmed fish, especially in Asia.

==Non-fisheries bycatch==
The term &quot;bycatch&quot; is used also in contexts other than fisheries. Examples are insect collecting with pitfall traps or flight interception traps for either financial, controlling or scientific purposes (where the bycatch may either be small vertebrates or untargeted insects) and control of introduced vertebrates which have become pest species like the muskrat in Europe (where the bycatch in traps may be European minks or waterfowl).

<doc id="363338" wikidata="Q187073" url="?curid=363338" title="Bologna Process">
<text>The Bologna Process is a series of ministerial meetings and agreements between European countries to ensure comparability in the standards and quality of higher-education qualifications. The process has created the European Higher Education Area under the Lisbon Recognition Convention. It is named after the University of Bologna, where the Bologna declaration was signed by education ministers from 29 European countries in 1999. The process was opened to other countries in the European Cultural Convention of the Council of Europe, and government meetings have been held in Prague (2001), Berlin (2003), Bergen (2005), London (2007), Leuven (2009), Budapest-Vienna (2010), Bucharest (2012), Yerevan (2015), Paris (2018), and Rome (2020).

Before the signing of the Bologna declaration, the Magna Charta Universitatum was issued at a meeting of university rectors celebrating the 900th anniversary of the University of Bologna (and European universities) in 1988. One year before the declaration, education ministers Claude Allègre (France), Jürgen Rüttgers (Germany), Luigi Berlinguer (Italy) and Baroness Blackstone (UK) signed the Sorbonne declaration in Paris in 1998, committing themselves to &quot;harmonising the architecture of the European Higher Education system&quot;. The Bologna Process has 49 participating countries.

==Signatories==
Signatories of the Bologna Accord, members of the European Higher Education Area, are:

* 1999: Austria, Belgium (Flemish Community and French Community of Belgium separately), Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom.
* 2001: Croatia, Cyprus, Liechtenstein, Turkey, European Commission
* 2003: Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Russia, Serbia, Vatican City
* 2005: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine
* May 2007: Montenegro
* 2010: Kazakhstan
* May 2015: Belarus
All member states of the EU are participating in the process, with the European Commission also a signatory. Monaco and San Marino are the only members of the Council of Europe which did not adopt the process.

The ESU, EUA, EURASHE, EI, ENQA, UNICE, the Council of Europe and UNESCO are part of the process&#x27; follow-up. Other groups at this level are ENIC, NARIC and EURODOC.

==Rejected countries==
Four countries, Israel, Kyrgyzstan, and the unrecognized Northern Cyprus and Kosovo, have applied to join but did not meet the membership criteria.

Israel is not a party to the European Cultural Convention of the Council of Europe, although it has observer status. Although Israel is not geographically part of Europe, it is part of the UNESCO European Region (although not a UNESCO member). Israel has also ratified the Lisbon Recognition Convention but, under the criteria of the 2003 Berlin Communiqué, it is ineligible for the Bologna Process.

Kosovo is not a party to the European Cultural Convention of the Council of Europe. Although Serbia is a party, Kosovo declared independence from it and has theoretically been a part of the Bologna Process since the Kosovo War. It was suggested that Kosovo could be associated with the process in a category appropriate to its situation, such as guest or special-observer status.

Kyrgyzstan is not a party to the European Cultural Convention of the Council of Europe, although has also ratified the Lisbon Recognition Convention.

Northern Cyprus is not a party to the European Cultural Convention of the Council of Europe and not recognized as an independent political entity by any member of the Bologna Process except Turkey.

==Qualifications framework==
The basic framework is three cycles of higher-education s. The framework adopted by the ministers at their meeting in Bergen in 2005 defines the qualifications in terms of learning outcomes, which are statements of what students know and can do on completing their degrees. In describing the cycles, the framework uses the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS):

* First cycle: typically 180–240 ECTS credits (a minimum of 60 credits per academic year), usually awarding a bachelor&#x27;s degree. The European Higher Education Area did not introduce a bachelor-with-honours programme, which allows graduates to receive a &quot;BA hons.&quot; degree (used, for example, in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada) and sometimes enables graduates to begin doctoral studies without first obtaining a master&#x27;s degree.
* Second cycle: typically 60–120 ECTS credits (a minimum of 60 credits per academic year), usually awarding a master&#x27;s degree.
* Third cycle (doctoral degree): There is no concrete ECTS range, since the disciplines vary in length and comprehensiveness. However, some countries have minimum credit weight requirements on doctoral degrees. Those country-level requirements typically require 120–420 ECTS of study.

In most cases, it would take three to four years to earn a bachelor&#x27;s degree and another one or two years for a master&#x27;s degree. Doctoral degrees usually require another two to four years of specialization, primarily individual research under a mentor. Degree names may vary by country. One academic year normally corresponds to 60 ECTS credits, equivalent to 1,500–1,800 hours of study.

==Effects by state==
The process, an intergovernmental agreement between EU and non-EU countries, does not have the status of EU legislation. Since the Bologna Declaration is not a treaty or convention, there are no legal obligations for the signatory states; participation and cooperation are voluntary.

Although the declaration was created without a formal affiliation with EU institutions, the European Commission (which has supported European projects such as the Tuning and TEEP projects) plays an important role in implementing the process. Most countries do not fit the framework, using their traditional systems. The process, which will result in bilateral agreements between countries and institutions which recognise each other&#x27;s degrees, is moving from strict convergence in time spent on qualifications towards a competency-based system which will have an undergraduate and postgraduate division (with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in the former and a master&#x27;s and doctorate in the latter).

In mainland Europe, five-year-plus first degrees are common. Many do not complete their studies, and many countries are introducing bachelor-level qualifications. The situation is evolving as the Bologna Process is implemented.

Some countries introduced the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS) and discussed their degree structures, qualifications, financing and management of higher education and mobility programmes. At the institutional level, the reform involved higher-education institutions, their faculties or departments, student and staff representatives and other factors. Priorities varied by country and institution.

===Andorra===
In Andorra, degrees are awarded by the state in all three cycles (bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctoral). The University of Andorra has adapted its classroom studies to the European Higher Education Area in accordance with the Bologna Agreement. The degree workload is counted in European credits, with a European equivalent of 180 credits (three years) for bachelor&#x27;s degrees and 120 credits (two years) for master&#x27;s degrees.

===Austria===
Austria&#x27;s situation is similar to Germany&#x27;s, with the lowest undergraduate degrees the Magister (FH) and Diplom (FH) (designed to take three or four years). The lowest graduate degrees are Magister and Diplom, which typically fulfill a thesis requirement (including final examination and thesis defence) and can be obtained after four to six years of study. In 2000 many curricula began to be converted into bachelor&#x27;s degrees (&quot;Bakkalaureat&quot;; the term was replaced by &quot;bachelor&#x27;s&quot; in most curricula by 2007) and master&#x27;s (&quot;Magisterstudium&quot;) programmes, with nominal durations of six semesters (three years) and three to four semesters (18 months to two years) respectively.

Enrollment in a doctoral programme generally requires a master&#x27;s degree in a related field. Although the nominal duration of doctoral programmes is two or three years, the time to graduate varies considerably and is generally longer.

===Armenia===

Armenia ratified the Bologna Process in 2005 and is a member of the European Higher Education Area.

===Azerbaijan===
Azerbaijan is a full member of the Bologna Process since 2005.

===Belarus===
Belarus became a member of the European Higher Education Area at a conference in Yerevan, Armenia, in May 2015.

===Croatia===
In Croatia, implementation of the Bologna Process began during the 2005–2006 academic year. 
&quot;Diploma&quot; degree became &quot;baccalaureate&quot; (bachelor&#x27;s degree, ), and the programmes were shortened from four to about three years. &quot;Magisterij&quot; (master&#x27;s degree) is achieved after two additional years of post-graduate study. The &quot;doktorat&quot; degree (doctorate) may be received after three more years (eight years total).

The typical length of study is three years for a bachelor&#x27;s degree (&quot;baccalaureus&quot;), two years for a master&#x27;s degree (&quot;magistar&quot;) and three years for a doctor of science (&quot;doktor znanosti&quot;). A local distinction is made between vocational and academic degrees at the baccalaureate level, and between engineering and other programs at levels below the doctoral.

There are several exceptions. The first degree in economics still takes four years, and the master&#x27;s degree is obtained after an additional year at the University of Zagreb&#x27;s Faculty of Economics and Zagreb School of Economics and Management. The four-plus-one-year system also applies to fine arts and music. Medical and related studies replace the bachelor&#x27;s degree with six-year first professional degrees and graduate Doctor of Medicine (&quot;doktor medicine&quot;) degrees.

The old degrees are translated as follows:
* &quot;Diploma&quot; holders hold master&#x27;s degrees (&quot;magistar inženjer&quot; for engineers and &quot;magistar&quot; for others).
* The old master&#x27;s degree is grandfathered into &quot;magistar znanosti&quot; (Master of Science), an intermediate title between the new master&#x27;s degree and a doctorate for local use.
* Doctoral degrees remain the same.

In May 2008, about 5,000 students protested weak funding, imprecisely defined new rules and the poor results of the Bologna reform.

===Denmark===
Denmark introduced the 3+2+3 system in 1971 with an education-management working group of the Society of Danish Engineers and a 1984–85 group of the Federation of Danish Industries, both headed by Hans Bruno Lund. Before the adoption of international standards, the lowest degree normally awarded at universities in Denmark was equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree (Kandidat/cand.mag). Although bachelor&#x27;s degrees have been obtained after three years of study, most students continue the additional two years required for a master&#x27;s degree. Mid-length (two-to four-year) professional degrees have been adapted as professional bachelor&#x27;s degrees ( years).

===Finland===
In the Finnish pre-Bologna system, higher education was divided between universities and polytechnics. In universities, degrees were divided in most fields into a three-year bachelor&#x27;s degree (&quot;kandidaatti&quot;) and a two-year master&#x27;s degree (&quot;maisteri&quot;). In these fields, the Bologna Process resulted in no change.

In engineering, universities only offered a -year master&#x27;s program (&quot;diplomi-insinööri&quot;). This has been replaced by a three-year bachelor&#x27;s degree (&quot;tekniikan kandidaatti&quot;) and a two-year master&#x27;s degree (&quot;diplomi-insinööri&quot;), for which the English names are Bachelor of Science (Technology) and Master of Science (Technology). A corresponding change has been made in military higher education, where the officer&#x27;s degree was divided between bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s programmes. Finnish Universities of Applied Sciences, which have offered bachelor&#x27;s-equivalent engineering programmes, began offering master&#x27;s-degree programs in 2005. Some Master of Engineering (&quot;insinööri (ylempi AMK)&quot;) programmes are taught in English.

Only medicine and dentistry retain their non-standard degree structure, where the Licentiate (higher than a master&#x27;s degree, but less extensive than Doctor of Medicine or Dentistry degrees) is the basic degree. A six-year program of at least 360 ECTS credits leads to the Licentiate of Medicine (&quot;lääketieteen lisensiaatti&quot;) degree. There is an intermediate title (but not an academic degree) of &quot;lääketieteen kandidaatti&quot;, and no master&#x27;s degree.

Polytechnic degrees are considered bachelor&#x27;s degrees in international use. In domestic use, bachelors transferring from polytechnics to universities may be required to amass a maximum of 60 ECTS credits of additional studies before beginning master&#x27;s-level studies. In conjunction with the Bologna Process, polytechnics have the right to award master&#x27;s degrees.

===France===
In France the &quot;baccalauréat&quot;, awarded at the end of secondary education, allows students to enter university. Before the LMD reform amid the 2000s which implemented the Bologna Process, it was followed by a two-year &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;études universitaires générales&quot; (DEUG) and a third-year Licence (the equivalent of a UK bachelor&#x27;s degree).

Students could then pursue a Maîtrise, a one-year research degree which could be followed by a one-year vocational degree (the &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;études supérieures spécialisées&quot; or DESS) or research degree (the &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;études approfondies&quot;, or DEA).
The DEA, preparation for a doctorate, was equivalent to the M. Phil. Students could then pursue a &quot;doctorat&quot; (PhD), which took at least three years.

The DESS was created in 1975 for students who completed four-year degrees. Intended as a doctorate with a more practical approach than research, it included the production of a 120-page paper which was defended to a jury of three international specialists in the field. The mini-thesis was kept in the libraries of the university issuing the DESS, unlike a PhD dissertation (distributed by its author to every French university library).

Higher education in France is also provided by non-university institutions dedicated to specific subjects. The &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;ingénieur&quot; (engineering diploma) is awarded to students after five years of study in state-recognized &quot;Écoles d&#x27;ingénieurs&quot;, particularly the Grandes Écoles such as Mines, Centrale and ENAC.

Although the &quot;baccalauréat&quot; and &quot;doctorat&quot; are unchanged in the Bologna system (known in France as LMD reform), the DEUG and &quot;licence&quot; have been merged into a three-year Licence. The Maîtrise, DESS and DEA have been combined into a two-year master&#x27;s degree, which can be work- (&quot;master professionnel&quot;) or research-oriented (&quot;master recherche&quot;). The &quot;Diplôme d&#x27;ingénieur&quot; degree is still separate from a university degree, but holders may legally claim a master&#x27;s degree as well.

Strikes occurred in 2002 and 2003 and 2007 protesting LMD reform, focusing more on under-funding of French universities since May 1968 than on the Bologna Process. Although the two major student organisations object to some aspects of its application to the French system, they generally welcome the European process.

===Georgia===
Although Georgia joined the Bologna Process in 2005 at the Bergen summit, steps towards the establishment of the European Higher Education Area were completed earlier. Since the end of the 1990s, many Georgian universities (mostly private) have introduced limited educational programs allowing students to graduate with a bachelor&#x27;s degree (four years) and earn a master&#x27;s degree (one to two years) while preserving the old five-to-six-year scheme. During the Soviet era, the only degree was the discontinued Specialist.

Cycles of higher education are divided into first (bachelor&#x27;s degree with 240 credits), second (master&#x27;s degree, 120 credits) and third (doctorate, 180 credits). Human and veterinary medicine and dentistry (300–360 credits) are integrated programs with a qualification equal to a master&#x27;s degree.

===Greece===
Greece joined the Bologna Process in 1999. Since 2007, more-intensive steps towards the establishment of the European Higher Education Area were completed.

===Hungary===
In Hungary, the Bologna system applies to those who began their university education in or after September 2006. One hundred and eight majors were available for selection (compared with over 400 in 2005), of which six are exempt from the bachelor&#x27;s-master&#x27;s division: law, human and veterinary medicine, dentistry, pharmacy and architecture.

According to an online poll by the National Tertiary Education Information Centre, 65 percent of respondents thought it unnecessary to adopt the system. The new system provides less of a guarantee that students will obtain a master&#x27;s degree, because many will complete their education after the three-year bachelor&#x27;s degree. Students are expected to study more unrelated subjects during the first three years, due to the smaller number of majors.

===Iceland===

In Iceland, bachelor&#x27;s degrees are usually three years in duration; master&#x27;s degrees are two years, and doctoral degrees range from three to six years.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, bachelor&#x27;s degrees are commonly three to four years in duration; master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees are basically similar to those in the UK. Bachelor&#x27;s degrees are first-cycle qualifications. Except for the MA at the Trinity College Dublin, a master&#x27;s degree is always a postgraduate degree (teaching or research). The generic outcomes for Irish degrees are laid out in the 2003 National Framework of Qualifications. In 2006, Ireland was the first country to verify the compatibility of its national framework with that of the EHEA.

===Italy===
Italy fits the framework since its 1999 adoption of the 3+2 system. The first degree is the &quot;Laurea triennale&quot;, which may be obtained after three years of study. Selected students may then complete their studies with two additional years of specialization leading to the &quot;Laurea Magistrale&quot;.

The Laurea corresponds to a bachelor&#x27;s degree; the Laurea Magistrale, corresponding to a master&#x27;s degree, grants access to third-cycle programmes (post-MA degrees, doctorates or specialized schools) lasting two to five years (completing a PhD usually takes three years). A five-year degree, Laurea Magistrale a Ciclo Unico (Single-cycle Master&#x27;s Degree) is awarded in law (Giurisprudenza), in Primary teacher education (Scienze della Formazione Primaria), in Architecture (Architettura), in Pharmacy (Farmacia) and Pharmaceutical Sciences (Chimica e Tecnologia Farmaceutiche), as well as in visual arts (Accademia di Belle Arti) and music (Conservatorio di Musica). A six-year degree, Laurea Magistrale a Ciclo Unico (Single-cycle Master&#x27;s Degree) is awarded in medicine (Medicina) and dentistry (Odontoiatria). The title for BA and BS undergraduate students is &quot;Dottore&quot; and for MA, MFA, MSc, MD and MEd graduate students &quot;Dottore magistrale&quot; (abbreviated &quot;Dott.&quot;, &quot;Dott.ssa&quot; or &quot;Dr.&quot;). This should not be confused with PhD and post-MA graduates, whose title is &quot;Dottore di Ricerca&quot; (Research Doctor).

The Italian system has two types of postgraduate degree (called &quot;Master&quot;, not to be confused with the master&#x27;s degree). &quot;Laurea Magistrale&quot; (120 ECTS) allows access to third-cycle programmes, and &quot;Master universitario&quot; (at least 60 ECTS) may be divided into first- (second cycle) and second-level master&#x27;s degrees (third cycle).
A first-level master&#x27;s degree is accessible by a first-cycle degree and &quot;does not allow access to PhD and to 3rd cycle programmes, since this type of course does not belong to the general requirements established at national level, but it is offered under the autonomous responsibility of each university&quot;.

===Kazakhstan===
Kazakhstan has been a full member of the Bologna Process and European Higher Education Area since 2010.

===Netherlands===
The Netherlands differentiates between HBO (university of applied sciences) and WO (scientific education or research universities). WO and HBO have adopted the bachelor&#x27;s-master&#x27;s system. It generally requires three (WO) or four (HBO) years of education to obtain a bachelor&#x27;s degree; graduates may then apply for a master&#x27;s program at a university, which generally require one to two years to complete. An HBO bachelor graduate may have to pass one year of pre-master&#x27;s education to bridge the gap between their HBO study and (research-oriented) WO study to be admitted to a WO Master&#x27;s programme, which may grant degrees such as MA, MSc and LLM. There are also HBO master&#x27;s studies, and HBOs are the only institutions offering associate degrees. A masters degree is the default (legal) requirement to enter a PhD program in the Netherlands. Dispensation can be granted on an individual base, judged by a special committee. With an HBO master&#x27;s degree, it is also possible to follow a professional doctorate at a university of applied sciences.

===Portugal===
Due to the Bologna Process, in 2005 new &quot;licenciatura&quot; (licentiate) degrees were organized at university and polytechnic institutions of Portugal. Previously a four- to six-year programme, equivalent to 300 ECTS, it is now a three-year first cycle and the only requirement for the two-year second cycle which awards a master&#x27;s degree. Some Bologna courses are integrated five- or six-year programmes awarding a joint master&#x27;s degree, a common practice in medicine. In engineering, despite the use of two cycles, an engineer may be licensed only after obtaining a master&#x27;s degree. Master&#x27;s degrees attained after five or six years of study correspond to the old undergraduate degrees known as &quot;licenciatura&quot;. The new &quot;licenciatura&quot;, obtained after three years of study, corresponds to the discontinued &quot;bacharelato&quot; awarded by polytechnics from the 1970s to the early 2000s (roughly equivalent to an extended associate degree). Old and new master&#x27;s degrees are the first graduate degree before a doctorate, and the old and new &quot;licenciatura&quot; are undergraduate degrees.

The &quot;licenciatura&quot; degree (a four- to six-year course) was required for applicants who wished to undertake the old master&#x27;s and doctoral programmes, but admission was reserved for those with a &quot;licenciatura&quot; degree with a grade above 14 (out of 20). After the changes introduced by the Bologna Process, the master&#x27;s degree is conferred at the end of a programme roughly equivalent in time to many old &quot;licenciatura&quot; programmes. The process was developed to improve the education system to one based on the development of competency rather than the transmission of knowledge. Its goal was the development of a system of easily comparable degrees to simplify the comparison of qualifications across Europe. Its flexibility and transparency is intended to enable wider recognition of student qualifications, facilitating movement around a European Higher Education Area based on two main cycles (undergraduate and graduate) and providing third-cycle degrees for doctoral candidates.

===Russia===
The Russian higher education framework was basically incompatible with the process. The generic, lowest degree in all universities since the Soviet era is the &quot;Specialist&quot;, which can be obtained after five to six years of study. Since the mid-1990s, many universities have introduced limited programmes allowing students to graduate with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in four years and a master&#x27;s degree in an additional one to two years while preserving the old system.

After accession to the Bologna process happened in 2003, in October 2007, Russia moved to two-tier education in line with the Bologna Process. Universities inserted a BSc diploma in the middle of their standard specialist programmes, but the transition to MS qualification has not been completed.

Although Specialists and masters are eligible for doctoral programmes (&quot;Aspirantura&quot;), bachelors are not; the Specialist degree is being discontinued. In most universities bachelor&#x27;s- and master&#x27;s-degree education is free of charge, although some state and private universities charge for one or both. The labour market does not yet understand BSc diplomas, but some universities made the program similar to classical education and the MS stage remains mandatory for most graduates.

===Sweden===
A bill proposing new regulations in the field of Higher Education was presented to Parliament in 2005, and the new system came into force in July 2007. The new system of degrees will have two degrees, of different lengths, in each cycle.

Students may not always be offered all the combinations above to obtain a degree. The is usually not offered, and many schools require students to obtain the before obtaining a or . Most third-cycle programmes require at least a , although the legal minimal requirement is either a degree from the second cycle or four years of finished courses, where at least one year is second cycle.

In July 2007 a new system of credits, compatible with the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System, was introduced in which one credit (&quot;högskolepoäng&quot;) in the new system corresponds to one ECTS credit and two-thirds of a credit in the old system (&quot;poäng&quot;).

Some Swedish universities have introduced the ECTS standard grading scale for all students, and others will use it only for international students. Since criterion-referenced grading is used instead of relative grading in the Swedish educational system, the 10-, 25-, 30-, 25- and 10-percent distribution of students among A, B, C, D and E will not be done. Some universities only give Fail or Pass grades (F or P) for certain courses (such as internship and thesis projects) or assignments, such as laboratory exercises.

==Seminars==
Several Bologna Process seminars have been held. The first devoted to a single academic discipline, Chemistry Studies in the European Higher Education Area (which approved Eurobachelor), was held in June 2004 in Dresden.

<doc id="363340" wikidata="Q2264756" url="?curid=363340" title="Separable extension">
<text>In field theory, a branch of algebra, an algebraic field extension formula_1 is called a separable extension if for every formula_2, the minimal polynomial of formula_3 over is a separable polynomial (i.e., its formal derivative is not the zero polynomial, or equivalently it has no repeated roots in any extension field). There is also a more general definition that applies when is not necessarily algebraic over . An extension that is not separable is said to be &quot;inseparable&quot;.

Every algebraic extension of a field of characteristic zero is separable, and every algebraic extension of a finite field is separable.
It follows that most extensions that are considered in mathematics are separable. Nevertheless, the concept of separability is important, as the existence of inseparable extensions is the main obstacle for extending many theorems proved in characteristic zero to non-zero characteristic. For example, the fundamental theorem of Galois theory is a theorem about normal extensions, which remains true in non-zero characteristic only if the extensions are also assumed to be separable.

The opposite concept, a purely inseparable extension, also occurs naturally, as every algebraic extension may be decomposed uniquely as a purely inseparable extension of a separable extension. An algebraic extension formula_1 of fields of non-zero characteristic is a purely inseparable extension if and only if for every formula_5, the minimal polynomial of formula_3 over is &quot;not&quot; a separable polynomial, or, equivalently, for every element of , there is a positive integer such that formula_7.

The simplest nontrivial example of a (purely) inseparable extension is formula_8, fields of rational functions in the indeterminate &quot;x&quot; with coefficients in the finite field formula_9. The element formula_10 has minimal polynomial formula_11, having formula_12 and a &quot;p&quot;-fold multiple root, as formula_13. This is a simple algebraic extension of degree &quot;p&quot;, as formula_14, but it is not a normal extension since the Galois group formula_15 is trivial.

==Informal discussion==
An arbitrary polynomial with coefficients in some field is said to have &quot;distinct roots&quot; or to be square-free if it has roots in some extension field formula_16. For instance, the polynomial has precisely roots in the complex plane; namely and , and hence &quot;does have&quot; distinct roots. On the other hand, the polynomial , which is the square of a non-constant polynomial &quot;does not&quot; have distinct roots, as its degree is two, and is its only root.

Every polynomial may be factored in linear factors over an algebraic closure of the field of its coefficients. Therefore, the polynomial does not have distinct roots if and only if it is divisible by the square of a polynomial of positive degree. This is the case if and only if the greatest common divisor of the polynomial and its derivative is not a constant. Thus for testing if a polynomial is square-free, it is not necessary to consider explicitly any field extension nor to compute the roots.

In this context, the case of irreducible polynomials requires some care. A priori, it may seem that being divisible by a square is impossible for an irreducible polynomial, which has no non-constant divisor except itself. However, irreducibility depends on the ambient field, and a polynomial may be irreducible over and reducible over some extension of . Similarly, divisibility by a square depends on the ambient field. If an irreducible polynomial over is divisible by a square over some field extension, then (by the discussion above) the greatest common divisor of and its derivative is not constant. Note that the coefficients of belong to the same field as those of , and the greatest common divisor of two polynomials is independent of the ambient field, so the greatest common divisor of and has coefficients in . Since is irreducible in , this greatest common divisor is necessarily itself. Because the degree of is strictly less than the degree of , it follows that the derivative of is zero, which implies that the characteristic of the field is a prime number , and may be written
:formula_17

A polynomial such as this one, whose formal derivative is zero, is said to be &quot;inseparable&quot;. Polynomials that are not inseparable are said to be &quot;separable&quot;. A &quot;separable extension&quot; is an extension that may be generated by &quot;separable elements&quot;, that is elements whose minimal polynomials are separable.

==Separable and inseparable polynomials==
An irreducible polynomial in is separable if and only if it has distinct roots in any extension of (that is if it may be factored in distinct linear factors over an algebraic closure of . 
Let in be an irreducible polynomial and its formal derivative. Then the following are equivalent conditions for the irreducible polynomial to be separable:
* If is an extension of in which is a product of linear factors then no square of these factors divides in (that is is square-free over ).
* There exists an extension of such that has pairwise distinct roots in .
* The constant is a polynomial greatest common divisor of and .
* The formal derivative of is not the zero polynomial.
* Either the characteristic of is zero, or the characteristic is , and is not of the form formula_18

Since the formal derivative of a positive degree polynomial can be zero only if the field has prime characteristic, for an irreducible polynomial to not be separable, its coefficients must lie in a field of prime characteristic. More generally, an irreducible (non-zero) polynomial in is not separable, if and only if the characteristic of is a (non-zero) prime number , and ) for some &quot;irreducible&quot; polynomial in . By repeated application of this property, it follows that in fact, formula_19 for a non-negative integer and some &quot;separable irreducible&quot; polynomial in (where is assumed to have prime characteristic &quot;p&quot;).

If the Frobenius endomorphism formula_20 of is not surjective, there is an element formula_21 that is not a th power of an element of . In this case, the polynomial formula_22 is irreducible and inseparable. Conversely, if there exists an inseparable irreducible (non-zero) polynomial formula_23 in , then the Frobenius endomorphism of cannot be an automorphism, since, otherwise, we would have formula_24 for some formula_25, and the polynomial would factor as formula_26

If is a finite field of prime characteristic &quot;p&quot;, and if is an indeterminate, then the field of rational functions over , , is necessarily imperfect, and the polynomial is inseparable (its formal derivative in &quot;Y&quot; is 0). More generally, if &quot;F&quot; is any field of (non-zero) prime characteristic for which the Frobenius endomorphism is not an automorphism, &quot;F&quot; possesses an inseparable algebraic extension.

A field &quot;F&quot; is perfect if and only if all irreducible polynomials are separable. It follows that is perfect if and only if either has characteristic zero, or has (non-zero) prime characteristic and the Frobenius endomorphism of is an automorphism. This includes every finite field.

==Separable elements and separable extensions==
Let formula_16 be a field extension. An element formula_2 is separable over if it is algebraic over , and its minimal polynomial is separable (the minimal polynomial of an element is necessarily irreducible).

If formula_29 are separable over , then formula_30, formula_31 and formula_32 are separable over &quot;F&quot;.

Thus the set of all elements in separable over forms a subfield of , called the separable closure of in .

The separable closure of in an algebraic closure of is simply called the separable closure of . Like the algebraic closure, it is unique up to an isomorphism, and in general, this isomorphism is not unique.

A field extension formula_16 is separable, if is the separable closure of in . This is the case if and only if is generated over by separable elements.

If formula_34 are field extensions, then is separable over if and only if is separable over and is separable over .

If formula_16 is a finite extension (that is is a -vector space of finite dimension), then the following are equivalent.
# is separable over .
# formula_36 where formula_37 are separable elements of .
# formula_38 where is a separable element of .
# If is an algebraic closure of , then there are exactly formula_39 field homomorphisms of into that fix .
# For any normal extension of that contains , then there are exactly formula_39 field homomorphisms of into that fix .
The equivalence of 3. and 1. is known as the &quot;primitive element theorem&quot; or &quot;Artin&#x27;s theorem on primitive elements&quot;.
Properties 4. and 5. are the basis of Galois theory, and, in particular, of the fundamental theorem of Galois theory.

==Separable extensions within algebraic extensions== 
Let formula_41 be an algebraic extension of fields of characteristic . The separable closure of in is formula_42 For every element formula_43 there exists a positive integer such that formula_44 and thus is a purely inseparable extension of . It follows that is the unique intermediate field that is &quot;separable&quot; over and over which is &quot;purely inseparable&quot;.

If formula_41 is a finite extension, its degree is the product of the degrees and . The former, often denoted , is referred to as the &quot;separable part&quot; of , or as the &#x27; of ; the latter is referred to as the &quot;inseparable part&quot; of the degree or the &#x27;. The inseparable degree is 1 in characteristic zero and a power of in characteristic .

On the other hand, an arbitrary algebraic extension formula_16 may not possess an intermediate extension that is &quot;purely inseparable&quot; over and over which is &quot;separable&quot;. However, such an intermediate extension may exist if, for example, formula_16 is a finite degree normal extension (in this case, is the fixed field of the Galois group of over ). Suppose that such an intermediate extension does exist, and is finite, then , where is the separable closure of in . The known proofs of this equality use the fact that if formula_48 is a purely inseparable extension, and if is a separable irreducible polynomial in , then remains irreducible in &quot;K&quot;[&quot;X&quot;]). This equality implies that, if is finite, and is an intermediate field between and , then .

The separable closure of a field is the separable closure of in an algebraic closure of . It is the maximal Galois extension of . By definition, is perfect if and only if its separable and algebraic closures coincide.

== Separability of transcendental extensions ==

Separability problems may arise when dealing with transcendental extensions. This is typically the case for algebraic geometry over a field of prime characteristic, where the function field of an algebraic variety has a transcendence degree over the ground field that is equal to the dimension of the variety.

For defining the separability of a transcendental extension, it is natural to use the fact that every field extension is an algebraic extension of a purely transcendental extension. This leads to the following definition.

A &quot;separating transcendence basis&quot; of an extension formula_16 is a transcendence basis of such that is a separable algebraic extension of . A finitely generated field extension is &quot;separable&quot; if and only it has a separating transcendence basis; an extension that is not finitely generated is called separable if every finitely generated subextension has a separating transcendence basis.

Let formula_16 be a field extension of characteristic exponent (that is in characteristic zero and, otherwise, is the characteristic). The following properties are equivalent:
* is a separable extension of ,
*formula_51 and are linearly disjoint over formula_52
*formula_53 is reduced,
*formula_54 is reduced for every field extension of ,
where formula_55 denotes the tensor product of fields, formula_56 is the field of the th powers of the elements of (for any field ), and formula_57 is the field obtained by adjoining to the th root of all its elements (see Separable algebra for details).

== Differential criteria ==
Separability can be studied with the aid of derivations. Let be a finitely generated field extension of a field . Denoting formula_58 the -vector space of the -linear derivations of , one has
:formula_59
and the equality holds if and only if &quot;E&quot; is separable over &quot;F&quot; (here &quot;tr.deg&quot; denotes the transcendence degree).

In particular, if formula_1 is an algebraic extension, then formula_61 if and only if formula_1 is separable.

Let formula_63 be a basis of formula_58 and formula_65. Then formula_66 is separable algebraic over formula_67 if and only if the matrix formula_68 is invertible. In particular, when formula_69, this matrix is invertible if and only if formula_70 is a separating transcendence basis.

<text>Smash Mouth is an American rock band from San Jose, California. The band was formed in 1994 and was originally composed of Steve Harwell (lead vocals), Kevin Coleman (drums), Greg Camp (guitar), and Paul De Lisle (bass). Harwell&#x27;s departure in 2021 left De Lisle as the sole remaining original member. They are known for their songs &quot;Walkin&#x27; on the Sun&quot; (1997), &quot;All Star&quot; (1999), and &quot;Then The Morning Comes&quot; (1999), as well as a cover of The Monkees&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot; (2001).

The band adopted retro styles covering several decades of popular music. They have also performed numerous covers of popular songs, including War&#x27;s &quot;Why Can&#x27;t We Be Friends?&quot;, Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up”, Simple Minds&#x27; &quot;Don&#x27;t You (Forget About Me)&quot;, ? &amp; the Mysterians&#x27; &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Enough of You Baby&quot;, The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Getting Better&quot;, Queen&#x27;s &quot;Under Pressure&quot;, House of Pain&#x27;s &quot;Jump Around&quot;, and &quot;I Wan&#x27;na Be Like You&quot; from &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;. They also composed two songs for the South Korean animated film &quot;Pororo, The Racing Adventure&quot;: &quot;Beside Myself&quot; and &quot;Everything Just Crazy&quot;.

==History==
===1990–1997: formation and &quot;Fush Yu Mang&quot;===
Smash Mouth&#x27;s roots trace back to 1990 when Steve Harwell and Kevin Coleman met. Smash Mouth was then formed in 1994 by Harwell, who had formerly played in a rap group called F.O.S. (Freedom of Speech). Coleman, who was Harwell&#x27;s manager, knew guitarist Greg Camp and bassist Paul De Lisle, who had both played in a local punk band, and introduced the three musicians to each other. They began rehearsing together along with Coleman, who played as the drummer. They soon developed into a band, and named themselves Smashmouth, an American football term. During their early years, the band played largely rock music.

The band&#x27;s first publicity came when a demo of the song &quot;Nervous in the Alley&quot; was played by a San Jose radio station, KOME. Soon after, Interscope Records signed the band, and the group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Fush Yu Mang&quot;, was released in 1997, featuring another member: the keyboardist Michael Klooster. Also, upon signing to Interscope Records, the band changed their name from Smashmouth to Smash Mouth. The album eventually went double platinum led by the band&#x27;s first major single &quot;Walkin&#x27; on the Sun&quot;. The singles &quot;The Fonz&quot; and a cover of &quot;Why Can&#x27;t We Be Friends&quot; from the 1998 Kevin Bacon film &quot;Wild Things&quot; were also subsequently released.

===1998–2004: rise to fame, &quot;Astro Lounge&quot;, &quot;Smash Mouth&quot;, and &quot;Get the Picture?&quot;===
The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Astro Lounge&quot;, was released in 1999 and marked a change in direction, as it had less of the previous ska influence and more of a pop sound. It led to more publicity for the band, and ended up being one of the most critically acclaimed albums from the group. Supported by the hit singles &quot;All Star&quot; (which was featured in several film soundtracks, most notably in &quot;Shrek&quot; (2001), although the official music video references &quot;Mystery Men&quot;) and &quot;Then the Morning Comes&quot;, &quot;Astro Lounge&quot; was eventually certified as triple platinum.

Also in 1999, &quot;The East Bay Sessions&quot; was released as a collection of early songs. Shortly after the release of the album, drummer Kevin Coleman left the band due to back problems. He was initially replaced by Michael Urbano, who was quickly replaced by Mitch Marine for the tour supporting &quot;Astro Lounge&quot;, who was subsequently replaced by Urbano after the tour.

In 2001, Smash Mouth covered the Monkees&#x27; hit song &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot;. It was featured on both the soundtrack for &quot;Shrek&quot; (along with &quot;All Star&quot;) and their self-titled album. The album sold fewer copies than the band&#x27;s earlier works, eventually being certified gold. Also in 2001, the group appeared as themselves in the climactic scene of the film &quot;Rat Race&quot;.

In 2003, &quot;Get the Picture?&quot; was released, featuring the singles &quot;You Are My Number One&quot;, &quot;Hang On&quot; and &quot;Always Gets Her Way&quot;. Smash Mouth was dropped from Interscope shortly after the release of &quot;Get the Picture?&quot;. That same year, the band performed a cover of the Sherman Brothers song &quot;I Wanna Be Like You&quot; for the animated film &quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot;.

===2005–2011: new label, fluctuating lineup and &quot;Summer Girl&quot;===
Smash Mouth released the greatest hits compilation &quot;All Star Smash Hits&quot; in 2005. The album contains some more popular songs from previous Smash Mouth albums, as well as songs from soundtrack albums that were not on the band&#x27;s releases. On certain networks and time slots, the album was advertised as having 18 tracks, including an edited version of &quot;Flo&quot;. Smash Mouth played at Gumby&#x27;s Birthday Celebration in August 2005.

In December 2005, the band released a Christmas album &quot;Gift of Rock&quot;. It featured covers of Christmas songs by many artists, such as the Kinks and the Ramones, and one original song, &quot;Baggage Claim&quot;.

Smash Mouth&#x27;s fifth studio album, originally to be titled &quot;Old Habits&quot;, was recorded in 2005 and expected to be released in early 2006. The band had said that the album was much more like the ska punk featured on &quot;Fush Yu Mang&quot; and &quot;The East Bay Sessions&quot;. In September 2005, the band performed what was tentatively going to be the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Getaway Car&quot;, on &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot;. The album was delayed many times, in the hope of gaining publicity with Harwell&#x27;s appearance on the reality show &quot;The Surreal Life&quot;. Smash Mouth returned to the studio intent on improving the record. &quot;Old Habits&quot; was shelved, replaced by &quot;Summer Girl&quot;, which included some remixed &quot;Old Habits&quot; tracks as well as new songs. After being delayed in much the same way &quot;Old Habits&quot; was for several months, the album was released on September 19, 2006. Smash Mouth let Sony Pictures use much of their music from &quot;Summer Girl&quot; and other songs for the movie &quot;Zoom&quot;, whose opening titles credit the film&#x27;s music to the band.

Before the release of &quot;Summer Girl&quot;, drummer Michael Urbano left the band without warning on February 14, 2006 due to creative differences. He was initially replaced by former drummer Mitch Marine, and then by Jason Sutter, best known for his work with American Hi-Fi and the Rembrandts. The band released their new album, &quot;Summer Girl&quot;, later that year. In early 2007, one year after joining the band, Sutter left Smash Mouth to play drums for former Soundgarden and Audioslave frontman Chris Cornell; fill-in drummer Marine returned to Smash Mouth.

Band members changed over the course of several years. Greg Camp left the band in the summer of 2008. Smash Mouth recruited Leroy Miller to play guitar. Leroy left in 2009 and Camp returned to the band, but in 2011 Camp left once again and this time the band recruited Sean Hurwitz. Hurwitz stayed until 2012, and was replaced by Mike Krompass. Later in 2012, Hurwitz returned. In 2009 Mitch Marine left once again and was replaced by Urbano, who left again after only one year in 2010, and was replaced by Marine once again. Marine left yet again after a brief spell in 2010 and was replaced by Randy Cooke. Cooke was briefly replaced by Jason Sutter in 2011, then Charlie Paxson.

In June 2011, a writer at Something Awful offered $20 if the band&#x27;s lead singer, Steve Harwell, would eat 24 eggs. Others on Twitter began offering additional sums, eventually targeted to various charities. In July 2011, Harwell accepted the challenge if fans could gather pledges of $10,000 for St. Jude Children&#x27;s Hospital. The fundraising goal was reached in less than a week. A self-styled &quot;reality TV fan,&quot; Harwell requested that his friend celebrity chef Guy Fieri prepare the eggs. The event was held at Johnny Garlic&#x27;s restaurant, in Dublin, California, on October 11, 2011. With about 150 people attending, Harwell was able to finish the eggs with the help of audience members as well as the San Jose Sharks mascot, Sharkie. $15,000 was raised for charity.

===2012–2019: &quot;Magic&quot;, live album and reunion with Camp===
After parting ways with Universal Records and signing with 429 Records, Smash Mouth released their sixth studio album titled &quot;Magic&quot;, on September 4, 2012. The album was primarily produced by new band member Mike Krompass. The first single, also entitled &quot;Magic&quot;, debuted on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart at No. 22. The band spent the rest of 2012 touring behind the new project as well as promoting the release of their musical book of food recipes and things of the like — &quot;Recipes from the Road&quot;. Cooke temporarily left again toward the end of 2012, replaced by Paxson. In 2013 the band took part in the &quot;Under the Sun&quot; with Gin Blossoms and Sugar Ray. Paxson left in July during the tour, and was initially going to be replaced by a returning Cooke; however, he was replaced by Sutter once again. Tod Burr, former drum tech of Def Leppard and drummer of Merle Jagger, came on board in 2012 as drum and keyboard tech of Smash Mouth.

On February 1, 2013, Smash Mouth headlined the AutoNation Coast to Coast rebranding event (which combined all AutoNation dealerships into a single brand) at Wayne Huizenga Park in Fort Lauderdale, Florida with Michela Paige from Season 3 of &quot;The Voice&quot;. The event also served as a final round in the AutoNation Culture of Caring Contest.

On October 6, 2014, Smash Mouth composed two songs for the English version of the South Korean animated film &quot;Pororo, The Racing Adventure&quot;, including &quot;Beside Myself&quot;, and &quot;Everything Just Crazy&quot; which plays at the end credits.

In 2014, Smash Mouth was part of the &quot;Under the Sun&quot; tour with Uncle Kracker, Blues Traveler, and Sugar Ray.

On June 14, 2015, Smash Mouth performed at the Taste of Fort Collins food festival in Fort Collins, Colorado. Before the encore, in an incident that lasted about three minutes, singer Steve Harwell became angry, yelled profanities at the audience, and left the stage after bread that had been distributed by the festival was thrown in the air and a few pieces were reportedly thrown onto the stage. Harwell later apologized for the incident in an interview with &quot;The Herald-Mail&quot;. Event organizer Jason Ornstein explained that he asked Harwell if he wanted him to have the DJs make an announcement instructing the crowd not to throw bread but according to Ornstein, Harwell &quot;stormed on [stage] and took matters into his own hands&quot;. He continued &quot;It wasn&#x27;t like anyone was going to be getting hurt by throwing bread up in the air ... We just had to laugh at it, because he just really made a fool of himself.&quot; Fort Collins Police Services stated laws prohibiting disorderly conduct, harassment, and &#x27;throwing of &quot;missiles,&quot;&#x27; i.e. objects, apply to event attendees.

In May 2016, Smash Mouth released their first live album titled &quot;Playlist: The Very Best of Smash Mouth&quot; through Sony Music. The recordings were harvested from shows in Rapid City, South Dakota, and Manila.

2016 saw the band gain a new member in Sam Eigen and the return of Cooke. Eigen is a long-time friend of both Steve Harwell and Paul De Lisle, and has played with Alanis Morissette, Janet Jackson, and John Fogerty. He can also be heard playing guitar on several of Harwell&#x27;s solo recordings over the years.

Greg Camp rejoined Smash Mouth in early 2018. An acoustic re-recording of Smash Mouth&#x27;s first album, &quot;Fush Yu Mang&quot;, funded through PledgeMusic was released in 2018 for the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary.

On November 1, 2018, Smash Mouth released the single &quot;Unity&quot;. It features hip-hop artists Kool Keith and Darryl McDaniels of Run-DMC. They then toured Australia in the same year during November to sell-out crowds around the country, performing a mix of theater, festival, and pub shows. During the Arlie Beach Festival of Music in Queensland, Steve Harwell became ill and had to leave the stage. However, Nicky Bomba, Frankie J Holden, Wilbur Wilde from Melbourne Ska Orchestra, and the remainder of Smash Mouth continued the set without him. Harwell recovered the next day and the Australian tour continued without any further incidents. In 2019, the band released a cover of the Hollies&#x27; song, &quot;Bus Stop&quot;.

===2020–present: Harwell&#x27;s departure and death, &quot;Missile Toes&quot; and &quot;Fush Yu Too&quot;===

On August 8, 2020, the band performed at the 2020 Sturgis Rally and vocalist Harwell said things such as &quot;fuck that COVID shit&quot; during the performance. A report from the IZA Institute of Labor Economics later cited the event as being a superspreading event.

In October 2021, the band performed at The Big Sip beer and wine festival in Bethel, New York. Harwell appeared to be intoxicated, threatening audience members and performing what looked like a Nazi salute. Following the performance, Harwell announced his retirement due to ongoing health issues. Prior to Harwell&#x27;s last show, the band was already performing with a substitute singer ostensibly filling in while Harwell dealt with his health issues.

In March 2022, it was announced upon Steve Harwell&#x27;s departure, that the band has recruited new lead singer Zach Goode (formerly of Ghoulspoon, Divided By Zero and The Secret Seven). On March 2, 2022, the band released a cover of Rick Astley&#x27;s song &quot;Never Gonna Give You Up&quot;. Smash Mouth released a new single, &quot;4th of July&quot;, on July 1, 2022.

In July 28, 2023, the band released &quot;Underground Sun&quot; as a single. The music video was created using AI.

On September 3, 2023, it was announced that Harwell was receiving hospice care and was expected to have only days left to live. Harwell died the next day at his home in Boise, Idaho, at the age of 56 from liver failure.

On November 6, 2023, the band announced their second Christmas album, &quot;Missile Toes&quot;, which released on November 17. The album consists of 10 songs, six of which are covers of classic Christmas songs, and four of which are originals. Featured artists Susanna Hoffs and Sophie Grey make appearances.

On April 12, 2024, Smash Mouth released the single and video &quot;Ride On&quot;, and on July 12, the band released a cover of the iconic Brady Bunch song, &quot;Sunshine Day&quot; featuring Greg Brady&#x27;s actor, Barry Williams.

Throughout summer 2024, the band embarked on the Ride On Tour with close to 100 shows, touring everywhere from Alaska to Hawaii with major festival stops in Mexico, Chile, Peru, and Malaysia along the way.

The band joined Cleopatra Records in late 2024, and released a cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Love Me Do&quot; in November. On December 4, 2024, the band confirmed a full length LP titled &quot;Fush Yu Too&quot; was in the works and was to be due by the end of February. Prior to that in March, during the Ride On Tour, the band hinted going back to the studio to record an LP in the same ska style as &quot;Fush Yu Mang&quot;.

On January 21st, 2025 the band released a cover of &quot;Blinding Lights&quot; by the Weeknd, with which the band had received backlash for using AI for the cover art. It was later confirmed that track, as well as &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, would be included on Cleopatra&#x27;s compilation album, &quot;Punk Rock Valentines&quot;, which released on February 7.

==Musical style==

Earlier in their career, Smash Mouth was part of the ska punk scene. After the success of their single, &quot;Walkin&#x27; on the Sun&quot;, the band began including more elements of psychedelic pop and other retro styles of the 1960s in their compositions. They would ultimately come to be known as a pop rock, power pop and alternative rock band, despite still retaining some elements of their ska and reggae roots.

<doc id="363344" wikidata="Q701051" url="?curid=363344" title="Wei Tao-ming">
<text>Wei Tao-ming (; October 28, 1899 – May 18, 1978) was a Chinese diplomat and public servant. He was the Republic of China&#x27;s Ambassador to the United States during the Second World War and foreign minister during the years when the People&#x27;s Republic of China sought to oust the ROC from the United Nations. He was also civilian Governor of Taiwan Province (1947–1949), replacing Governor General Chen Yi.

Wei enlisted USA help to support Taiwan and oppose the Chinese communists.

==Early life==
Wei Tao-ming was born in Jiujiang, Jiangxi province in 1899. His father, Wei Tiao-yuan, was an educator and member of Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s revolutionary movement. Wei Tao-ming&#x27;s early schooling was at a missionary school, though he graduated from Kiangsi (Jiangxi) First Middle School in 1918. He then studied French in Beijing for a year before moving to France in 1919. He obtained his doctorate in law from the University of Paris in 1926 and returned to China to pursue a legal career in Shanghai.

He was married to Zheng Yuxiu, the first female lawyer and judge in Chinese history. She earned her doctoral degree in law at the Sorbonne in France and was the first Chinese person to practice law at the French extraterritorial courts in Shanghai. Zheng was also one of the revolutionaries involved in the attempted assassination of military official and politician Yuan Shikai, commonly reviled in Chinese history for taking advantage of both the Qing imperial court and the Republicans. She advocated women having their own voices and choices in marriage, and wrote it into the Republic of China&#x27;s law. Her autobiography, &quot;My Revolutionary Years&quot; (1944), was published while her husband was Ambassador to the United States, and is revered as one of the best first hand accounts of modern Chinese history.

==Political career==
He became involved with the Kuomintang. At the age of 29, Wei became president of the Judicial Yuan. From 1930 to 1931, Wei served as mayor of special municipality of Nanjing, then capital of the Republic of China.

Wei was among the Nationalist government insiders implicated in corruption during the 1942-1943 American Dollar Bond scandal. After the 1941 Japanese declaration of war against the United States and the United Kingdom, the two allies sought to support China in a concrete way despite logistical limitations following the loss of British Burma. The two countries loaned significant amounts of money to the Nationalist government. The Nationalist government decided to use USD$200 million to absorb excess fabi in an effort to curb inflation. In theory, Chinese purchasers would use fabi to buy bonds at the official exchange rate and be paid in dollars when the bonds were redeemed following victory over Japan. The American Dollar Bonds were issued on March 24, 1942. The public response was poor, with few bond sales. In October 1943, H.H. Kung sent a secret memorandum to Chiang Kai-shek asking that the bond sales end. Subscriptions were closed on October 15, 1943 and a central bank official falsely announced that all bonds had been sold. Secretly, insiders then purchased the remaining bonds using currency acquired on the black market. The result was a windfall for Nationalist government insiders including Wei, Kung, Long Yun, members of the Soong family, and others.

As Ambassador to the United States from September 1942 to 1946, Wei helped secure American material and military support for the Republic of China as it resisted Japanese invasion and Communist insurgency. His public declarations were covered by the New York Times, and he accompanied Soong Mei-ling during her visits to Washington, D.C., and New York. He resigned from his post in October 1945, citing personal reasons, and was succeeded by Wellington Koo, then Ambassador to the Court of St. James.

Wei&#x27;s wife Zheng Yuxiu christened the &quot;SS China Victory&quot; in 1944. The Ceremony had both an ancient Chinese invocation to the sea gods and the traditional American tradition of a bottle of champagne breaking. The matron of honor at the launching was Mrs. T. K. Chang, wife of the Chinese consul at Los Angeles. &quot;SS&quot; &quot;China Victory&quot; was the first of a long line of Victory ships to leave the Calship building.

During his tenure as Governor of Taiwan Province, Wei created the Departments of Civil Affairs (民政廳), Finance (財政廳), Construction (建設廳), and Education (教育廳). He also employed thirteen members on the provincial board (省政委員), including those who were Taiwanese-born. He became the minister of foreign affairs after being the Governor (position succeeded by Chen Tsyr-shiou).

After the Chinese Communist Revolution, Wei spent some time in Hong Kong, then made his way back to Taiwan.

Wei served as foreign minister of the Republic of China during the 1960s and was active in maintaining U.S. support for Taipei. He also maintained a coalition in the United Nations General Assembly to reject membership for the People&#x27;s Republic of China. He resigned for health reasons in 1971 as Beijing&#x27;s campaign to oust the ROC from the United Nations was on the verge of succeeding. 

He died in Taipei on May 18, 1978, at the age 78.

<text>Chen Cheng (; ; January 4, 1898 – March 5, 1965), courtesy name Tsi-siou (), was a Chinese political and military leader, and one of the main commanders of the National Revolutionary Army during the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War.

After moving to Taiwan at the end of the civil war, he served as the Governor of Taiwan Province, Vice President, and Premier of the Republic of China (ROC). He represented the ROC in visits to the United States and helped to initiate land reforms and tax reduction programs that caused communism to become unattractive in Taiwan since peasants were able to own land.

==Early life==
Chen Cheng was born in Qingtian County, Zhejiang, graduated from Baoding Military Academy in 1922, and entered Whampoa Military Academy two years later. It was there that he first met Chiang Kai-shek, Commandant of the Academy. Later, Chen joined National Revolutionary Army to participate in the Northern Expedition.

==Rise in military==
During the Northern Expedition, Chen displayed good leadership ability. Within a year, he was promoted from commanding battalions to divisions already.

After the expedition, Chen became active in the wars against the warlords. His successes in the battles allowed him to be promoted again, to the commander of the 18th Army.

==Anticommunist campaigns==
In 1931, Chen was assigned the task of suppressing the Red Army. In various campaigns searching for the main force of Red Army, Chen&#x27;s units experienced heavy casualties. In the fifth campaign against the Communists, he finally managed to defeat them, which forced the Red Army to launch its Long March.

Campaigns against the Red Army came to an end after the Xi&#x27;an Incident in which Chiang and his staff were forced to agree to co-operate with the communists against the invading Imperial Japanese Army.

==War against Japan==

During the Battle of Shanghai, he was one of the top military assistants of Chiang Kai Shek. It was his idea to seek a decisive action in Southern China, rather than confronting the Japanese in Northern China, where Nationalist troops were in poor condition and lacked transporting vehicles. After the fall of Shanghai and of Nanjing, Chen moved to Hubei to command the Battle of Wuhan in 1938. Wuhan was the provisional headquarters of the Chinese Army. The Japanese, however, managed, despite heavy losses to defeat the Chinese and captured Wuhan on October 25, 1938.

In the last years of the war, Chen went on to command in the Battle of Changsha, the Battle of Yichang, and the Battle of West Hubei. In 1943, he was appointed the commander of the Chinese Expeditionary Force in the Burma Theater until he was replaced by Wei Li-huang because of illness.

==Chinese Civil War==

After the Second Sino-Japanese War, Chen became the Chief of the General Staff and commander-in-chief of the navy. He followed Chiang&#x27;s orders and began to raid the &quot;liberated&quot; areas of the Red Army, which launched the Chinese Civil War.

In August 1947, Chiang appointed Chen as director of the Northeastern Headquarters to command the Nationalist forces against the Communists in that area. He made the crucial mistake of dissolving the local security regiments because they had served in the Japanese-collaborationist Manchukuo Imperial Army, which made the total Nationalist strength in Manchuria fall from 1.3 million to less than 480,000. He also dismissed some of the most capable Nationalist commanders, such as Du Yuming, Sun Li-jen, Zheng Dongguo, and Chen Mingren. As a result, he suffered a series of major defeats, and Chiang recalled Chen to Nanjing and sent Wei Lihuang to replace him in Shenyang as Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast and Fan Hanjie as deputy commander-in-chief and director of Jinzhou forward command center. Chen took a sick leave in Taiwan to treat his chronic stomach ailment.

==In Taiwan==

Chiang appointed Chen as the Governor of Taiwan Province in 1949 to plan the development of Taiwan as a Nationalist stronghold. After the Nationalist force retreated to Taiwan, Chen went on to hold key civilian government positions such as Vice-Executive of the Kuomintang, Vice President, and Premier of the Republic of China. He was the youngest premier since promulgation of the 1947 constitution to take office.

In his years on Taiwan, he introduced various land and economic reforms and carried out the reconstruction of Taiwan. Chen&#x27;s 37.5% Arable Rent Reduction initiative was credited with stopping the spread of communism in Taiwan. The policy capped the rent farmers paid to landlords at 37.5% of the harvest. Prior to the directive, landlords had often sought more than half of the crop as payment.

He was also credited with launching several construction projects. One was the Shimen Reservoir, in Taoyuan County, which reduced flooding and increased the rice crop production.

On May 19, 1949, Chen promulgated the Order of Martial Law to announce the imposition of martial law throughout Taiwan to expel communist infiltration and to buffer defense capabilities.

==Death==

Chen died of hepatic tumors in 1965. His cremated remains were moved to Fo Guang Shan, Kaohsiung County (now part of Kaohsiung City), in August 1995.

<text>Various types of stability may be discussed for the solutions of differential equations or difference equations describing dynamical systems. The most important type is that concerning the stability of solutions near to a point of equilibrium. This may be discussed by the theory of Aleksandr Lyapunov. In simple terms, if the solutions that start out near an equilibrium point formula_1 stay near formula_1 forever, then formula_1 is Lyapunov stable. More strongly, if formula_1 is Lyapunov stable and all solutions that start out near formula_1 converge to formula_1, then formula_1 is said to be asymptotically stable (see asymptotic analysis). The notion of &quot;exponential stability&quot; guarantees a minimal rate of decay, i.e., an estimate of how quickly the solutions converge. The idea of Lyapunov stability can be extended to infinite-dimensional manifolds, where it is known as structural stability, which concerns the behavior of different but &quot;nearby&quot; solutions to differential equations. Input-to-state stability (ISS) applies Lyapunov notions to systems with inputs.

==History==
Lyapunov stability is named after Aleksandr Mikhailovich Lyapunov, a Russian mathematician who defended the thesis &quot;The General Problem of Stability of Motion&quot; at Kharkov University in 1892. A. M. Lyapunov was a pioneer in successful endeavors to develop a global approach to the analysis of the stability of nonlinear dynamical systems by comparison with the widely spread local method of linearizing them about points of equilibrium. His work, initially published in Russian and then translated to French, received little attention for many years. The mathematical theory of stability of motion, founded by A. M. Lyapunov, considerably anticipated the time for its implementation in science and technology. Moreover Lyapunov did not himself make application in this field, his own interest being in the stability of rotating fluid masses with astronomical application. He did not have doctoral students who followed the research in the field of stability and his own destiny was terribly tragic because of his suicide in 1918 . For several decades the theory of stability sank into complete oblivion. The Russian-Soviet mathematician and mechanician Nikolay Gur&#x27;yevich Chetaev working at the Kazan Aviation Institute in the 1930s was the first who realized the incredible magnitude of the discovery made by A. M. Lyapunov. The contribution to the theory made by N. G. Chetaev was so significant that many mathematicians, physicists and engineers consider him Lyapunov&#x27;s direct successor and the next-in-line scientific descendant in the creation and development of the mathematical theory of stability.

The interest in it suddenly skyrocketed during the Cold War period when the so-called &quot;Second Method of Lyapunov&quot; (see below) was found to be applicable to the stability of aerospace guidance systems which typically contain strong nonlinearities not treatable by other methods. A large number of publications appeared then and since in the control and systems literature.
More recently the concept of the Lyapunov exponent (related to Lyapunov&#x27;s First Method of discussing stability) has received wide interest in connection with chaos theory. Lyapunov stability methods have also been applied to finding equilibrium solutions in traffic assignment problems.

==Definition for continuous-time systems==
Consider an autonomous nonlinear dynamical system

:formula_8,

where formula_9 denotes the system state vector, formula_10 an open set containing the origin, and formula_11 is a continuous vector field on formula_10. Suppose formula_13 has an equilibrium at formula_1 so that formula_15 then

# This equilibrium is said to be Lyapunov stable if for every formula_16 there exists a formula_17 such that if formula_18 then for every formula_19 we have formula_20.
# The equilibrium of the above system is said to be asymptotically stable if it is Lyapunov stable and there exists formula_17 such that if formula_22 then formula_23.
# The equilibrium of the above system is said to be exponentially stable if it is asymptotically stable and there exist formula_24 such that if formula_18 then formula_26 for all formula_19.

Conceptually, the meanings of the above terms are the following:
# Lyapunov stability of an equilibrium means that solutions starting &quot;close enough&quot; to the equilibrium (within a distance formula_28 from it) remain &quot;close enough&quot; forever (within a distance formula_29 from it). Note that this must be true for &quot;any&quot; formula_29 that one may want to choose.
# Asymptotic stability means that solutions that start close enough not only remain close enough but also eventually converge to the equilibrium.
# Exponential stability means that solutions not only converge, but in fact converge faster than or at least as fast as a particular known rate formula_31.

The trajectory &quot;formula_32&quot; is (locally) &quot;attractive&quot; if

:formula_33 as formula_34

for all trajectories formula_35 that start close enough to formula_36, and &quot;globally attractive&quot; if this property holds for all trajectories.

That is, if &quot;x&quot; belongs to the interior of its stable manifold, it is &quot;asymptotically stable&quot; if it is both attractive and stable. (There are examples showing that attractivity does not imply asymptotic stability. Such examples are easy to create using homoclinic connections.)

If the Jacobian of the dynamical system at an equilibrium happens to be a stability matrix (i.e., if the real part of each eigenvalue is strictly negative), then the equilibrium is asymptotically stable.

===System of deviations===
Instead of considering stability only near an equilibrium point (a constant solution formula_37), one can formulate similar definitions of stability near an arbitrary solution formula_32. However, one can reduce the more general case to that of an equilibrium by a change of variables called a &quot;system of deviations&quot;. Define formula_39, obeying the differential equation:

:formula_40.

This is no longer an autonomous system, but it has a guaranteed equilibrium point at formula_41 whose stability is equivalent to the stability of the original solution formula_32. 

===Lyapunov&#x27;s second method for stability===
Lyapunov, in his original 1892 work, proposed two methods for demonstrating stability. The first method developed the solution in a series which was then proved convergent within limits. The second method, which is now referred to as the Lyapunov stability criterion or the Direct Method, makes use of a &quot;Lyapunov function V(x)&quot; which has an analogy to the potential function of classical dynamics. It is introduced as follows for a system formula_43 having a point of equilibrium at formula_44. Consider a function formula_45 such that
* formula_46 if and only if formula_44
* formula_48 if and only if formula_49
* formula_50 for all values of formula_51 . Note: for asymptotic stability, formula_52 for formula_49 is required.
Then &quot;V(x)&quot; is called a Lyapunov function and the system is stable in the sense of Lyapunov. (Note that formula_54 is required; otherwise for example formula_55 would &quot;prove&quot; that formula_56 is locally stable.) An additional condition called &quot;properness&quot; or &quot;radial unboundedness&quot; is required in order to conclude global stability. Global asymptotic stability (GAS) follows similarly.

It is easier to visualize this method of analysis by thinking of a physical system (e.g. vibrating spring and mass) and considering the energy of such a system. If the system loses energy over time and the energy is never restored then eventually the system must grind to a stop and reach some final resting state. This final state is called the attractor. However, finding a function that gives the precise energy of a physical system can be difficult, and for abstract mathematical systems, economic systems or biological systems, the concept of energy may not be applicable.

Lyapunov&#x27;s realization was that stability can be proven without requiring knowledge of the true physical energy, provided a Lyapunov function can be found to satisfy the above constraints.

==Definition for discrete-time systems==
The definition for discrete-time systems is almost identical to that for continuous-time systems. The definition below provides this, using an alternate language commonly used in more mathematical texts.

Let (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;d&quot;) be a metric space and &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;X&quot; a continuous function. A point &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; is said to be Lyapunov stable, if,

:formula_57

We say that &quot;x&quot; is asymptotically stable if it belongs to the interior of its stable set, &quot;i.e.&quot; if,

:formula_58

==Stability for linear state space models==
A linear state space model

:formula_59,

where formula_60 is a finite matrix, is asymptotically stable (in fact, exponentially stable) if all real parts of the eigenvalues of formula_60 are negative. This condition is equivalent to the following one:

:formula_62

is negative definite for some positive definite matrix formula_63. (The relevant Lyapunov function is formula_64.)

Correspondingly, a time-discrete linear state space model

:formula_65

is asymptotically stable (in fact, exponentially stable) if all the eigenvalues of formula_60 have a modulus smaller than one.

This latter condition has been generalized to switched systems: a linear switched discrete time system (ruled by a set of matrices formula_67)

:formula_68

is asymptotically stable (in fact, exponentially stable) if the joint spectral radius of the set formula_67 is smaller than one.

==Stability for systems with inputs==

A system with inputs (or controls) has the form

:formula_70

where the (generally time-dependent) input u(t) may be viewed as a &quot;control&quot;, &quot;external input&quot;,
&quot;stimulus&quot;, &quot;disturbance&quot;, or &quot;forcing function&quot;. It has been shown that near to a point of equilibrium which is Lyapunov stable the system remains stable under small disturbances. For larger input disturbances the study of such systems is the subject of control theory and applied in control engineering. For systems with inputs, one must quantify the effect of inputs on the stability of the system. The main two approaches to this analysis are BIBO stability (for linear systems) and input-to-state stability (ISS) (for nonlinear systems)

==Example==
This example shows a system where a Lyapunov function can be used to prove Lyapunov stability but cannot show asymptotic stability.
Consider the following equation, based on the Van der Pol oscillator equation with the friction term changed:

:formula_71

Let

:formula_72

so that the corresponding system is

:formula_73

The origin formula_74 is the only equilibrium point.
Let us choose as a Lyapunov function

:formula_75

which is clearly positive definite. Its derivative is

:formula_76

It seems that if the parameter formula_77 is positive, stability is asymptotic for formula_78 But this is wrong, since formula_79 does not depend on formula_80, and will be 0 everywhere on the formula_80 axis. The equilibrium is Lyapunov stable but not asymptotically stable.

==Barbalat&#x27;s lemma and stability of time-varying systems==
It may be difficult to find a Lyapunov function with a negative definite derivative as required by the Lyapunov stability criterion, however a function formula_82 with formula_83 that is only negative semi-definite may be available. In autonomous systems, the invariant set theorem can be applied to prove asymptotic stability, but this theorem is not applicable when the dynamics are a function of time. 

Instead, Barbalat&#x27;s lemma allows for Lyapunov-like analysis of these non-autonomous systems. The lemma is motivated by the following observations. Assuming f is a function of time only:

* Having formula_84 does not imply that formula_85 has a limit at formula_86. For example, formula_87.
* Having formula_85 approaching a limit as formula_89 does not imply that formula_84. For example, formula_91.
* Having formula_85 lower bounded and decreasing (formula_93) implies it converges to a limit. But it does not say whether or not formula_94 as formula_89.

Barbalat&#x27;s Lemma says:
:If formula_85 has a finite limit as formula_89 and if formula_98 is uniformly continuous (a sufficient condition for uniform continuity is that formula_99 is bounded), then formula_84 as formula_101.

An alternative version is as follows:

:Let formula_102 and formula_103. If formula_104 and formula_105, then formula_106 as formula_107 

In the following form the Lemma is true also in the vector valued case:

:Let formula_85 be a uniformly continuous function with values in a Banach space formula_109 and assume that formula_110 has a finite limit as formula_111. Then formula_106 as formula_111.

The following example is taken from page 125 of Slotine and Li&#x27;s book &quot;Applied Nonlinear Control&quot;.

Consider a non-autonomous system
:formula_114
:formula_115

This is non-autonomous because the input formula_116 is a function of time. Assume that the input formula_117 is bounded.

Taking formula_118 gives formula_119

This says that formula_120 by first two conditions and hence formula_121 and formula_122 are bounded. But it does not say anything about the convergence of formula_121 to zero, as formula_83 is only negative semi-definite (note formula_122 can be non-zero when formula_83=0) and the dynamics are non-autonomous.

Using Barbalat&#x27;s lemma:

:formula_127.

This is bounded because formula_121, formula_122 and formula_116 are bounded. This implies formula_131 as formula_86 and hence formula_133. This proves that the error converges.

<text>Edwin Abbott (12 May 1808 – 27 May 1882) was an English educator.

Abbott was born in London in 1808, the son of Edward Abbott, an oilman and Italian warehouseman descended from George Abbot, archbishop of Canterbury. In 1827 he was made headmaster of the Philological School of General Instruction, Marylebone, the school he had himself attended. As a headmaster he was known as firm but humane. He married his first cousin Jane Abbott (1806–1882) in 1831. The couple had eight children, including Edwin Abbott Abbott, author of &quot;Flatland&quot;; a daughter, Elizabeth, married John Humffreys Parry.

Abbott&#x27;s social concern led him to keep up contact with the Christian Socialists. He translated the third volume of J. H. Merle D&#x27;Aubigné&#x27;s history of the reformation, wrote textbooks on Latin, English grammar and arithmetic, and published a concordance to Alexander Pope.

Abbott retired as headmaster in 1872, and died at Upper Norwood in 1882. The school was renamed St Marylebone Grammar School in 1901, and one of the four senior houses was named after Abbott.

<doc id="363371" wikidata="Q7488335" url="?curid=363371" title="Barbi Twins">
<text>Shane and Sia Barbi ( Carlson; born April 2, 1963), popularly known as The Barbi Twins, are American identical twins, cover models, co-authors, and frequently nude spokespersons as part of their animal rights advocacy.

==Modeling==
Shane and Sia began modeling at the age of seven when they posed for a layout in the Sears mail-order catalog. As adults, their career has included fashion and mainly pin-up modeling. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; did a cover story about the Barbi Twins when their billboard went up on Sunset Boulevard in 1989 immediately catapulting them to worldwide attention. In 1989, 1990, and early 1991, they modeled for Chanel, Thierry Mugler, Jean Paul Gaultier, John Galliano and others.

===&quot;Playboy&quot;===
According to their 2001 &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot;, the billboard, and the press that came from it, caught the eye of Hugh Hefner. The twins were put on the cover of &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine in the September 1991 issue, which broke records by selling out in less than two weeks. In an unprecedented move, Hefner erected a billboard to promote the Barbi Twins and their second &quot;Playboy&quot; issue (which also broke sales records).

===Other print work===
&quot;USA Today&quot; said that the twins career brought them &quot;caviar dreams and champagne life styles of the rich and famous&quot;. Playboy called their covers &quot;legendary&quot; and credited their subsequent television appearances with &quot;the highest ratings&quot;, remarking that the twins became Hollywood landmarks and global obsessions. The twins have also generated a degree of controversy – a Saturday morning cartoon and an MTV show were criticized for being &quot;too sexy&quot; or &quot;too controversial&quot;.

Magazines and tabloids called them everything from &quot;the sexiest twins alive&quot; and &quot;the best selling calendar models of the world&quot; (&quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; UK) to referring to them as both &quot;bizarre and bulimic&quot; and &quot;sexual icons and America&#x27;s cartoon sweethearts&quot; (&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;) They were a favorite for cover models appearing on the covers and inside not only &quot;Playboy&quot; but mainstream national and international magazines including &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; and &quot;Redbook&quot;. Newspapers, magazines and tabloids including &#x27;USA TODAY&quot;.

Shane Barbi was among the many notable quotables when &quot;Newsweek&quot;″s &quot;Overheard&quot; section (syndicated from the &quot;New York Post&quot;, Page Six) picked up a quote from her during an interview, &quot;You can ask us about our cup size or favorite positions but please no personal questions.&quot; &quot;Stuff&quot; magazine gave the twins the title of &quot;Sex Symbols for 1993&quot;, placing them in good company with other popular female icons such as Marilyn Monroe (1956), Farrah Fawcett (1977), Madonna (1991), Sharon Stone (1992), and Cindy Crawford (1994).

&quot;Redbook&quot; magazine took excerpts from the book &quot;Diana&#x27;s Boys&quot;, which reveals how Prince William had his first crush on the Barbi Twins.

After four years of the &quot;best selling calendars&quot;, photographs from a photo shoot were stolen from a NY film lab and &quot;held for ransom&quot; but were later returned.

In 2011 were featured and voted as one of MAXIM&#x27;s Hottest Famous Twins, were featured in numerous movie posters on behalf of animal causes (see Animal Activism below) and on covers and featured articles in True Cowboy Magazine.

===Merchandising===
Shane and Sia posed together in several internationally distributed Barbi Twins calendars from 1993 to 2007. After the success of their 1993 calendar the &quot;Barbi Mania&quot; continued with dozens of posters, a comic-art calendar and two comic books. Other merchandise such as promotional trading cards, postcards, gift cards, gift wrap, mugs, lighters and just about any product that could have their images (or more specifically bodies) stamped on it were for sale. &quot;The Daily Star UK&quot; ran a comic strip called &quot;The Barbi Twins&quot;, and featuring the twin models with psychic abilities. Gift shops worldwide contained Barbi Twin products and every Spencer Gifts had dedicated a corner to Barbi Twin merchandise as &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot; reported.

===Film and television===
&quot;48 Hours&quot; did a special on the Barbi Twins in 2002 on their eating disorders, and the &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot; did a biography on the twins in 2001. They also had several guest appearances on talk shows for television and radio, such as &quot;The Geraldo Rivera Show&quot; and &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;. The twins made several appearances along with William Shatner, John Landis, and many others in the American animated series &quot;Eek! The Cat&quot; playing twin rocket scientists, &quot;Dr. Shane and Dr. Sia&quot;. In 2007, they received an associate producer credit on Curt Johnson&#x27;s animal activist documentary titled &quot;Your Mommy Kills Animals&quot;, which received highly acclaimed reviews from &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

In 2010 the twins again showed their support for the animal community and were featured in the movie &quot;Skin Trade&quot;.

In 2012 the twins announced their first feature documentary called &quot;I HAVE A DREAM&quot; about breed discrimination. Breed discrimination was at the root of the recent death of Lennox, a dog that was destroyed just for being a breed too similar to a pit bull.

===Barbi v. Flynt===
In November 2003, the Barbi Twins sued Larry Flynt and &quot;Hustler&quot; magazine for shots taken at &quot;Playboy&quot; studios that eventually found their way into the January 2004 issue of &quot;Hustler&quot; without permission. The twins had a vitamin line they were planning to be introduced in 2004 and they claimed that the pictures, &quot;allegedly&quot; taken by Shane&#x27;s then-husband Ken Wahl, were never meant to be published. They sued for both the pictures and a fictional story that appeared in &quot;Hustler&quot; as the Barbi Twins claimed it ruined their health image. However, the twins&#x27; lawsuit was not successful, as Flynt possessed a valid photo release signed by the twins.

==Personal lives and history==

===Parents===
The twins are the daughters of property developer Bob Carlson (d. October 2001), a devout Christian, and Marsha Barbi, a former Miss Ohio, but their parents divorced when the twins were just two. The twins believe that their mother was always a lesbian and when she left their father, she and they traveled to West Hollywood where Marsha became an &quot;outspoken lesbian feminist&quot;. According to the twins, Marsha had numerous lesbian lovers including some quite famous women. Then she met closeted singer Dusty Springfield in 1975 and the two women lived together for two years.

===Spouses===
Shane Barbi married actor Ken Wahl in 1997.

===Health issues===
The twins struggled with bulimia. According to their &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot; and a candid interview in &quot;USA TODAY&quot; their bulimia and insecurities caused them to be obsessed with crash-dieting, bingeing and purging, abusing laxatives and destructive exercise routines for up to 10 hours a day. Their disorders manifested into agoraphobia preventing them from attending the Hollywood major premieres and invitations they received, causing them to cancel events, and to turn down offers for their own television shows and movies, and even dates with their high-profile suitors.

During their recovery, the twins armed themselves with degrees in health and nutrition, and began lecturing in 2000 on &quot;How to eat to live, not live to eat&quot;. They lectured at the Learning Annex, universities and high schools as well as on radio, television and on-line. In early 2001, they came out to the nation on the CBS television program &quot;48HRS&quot; in a piece about eating disorders, entitled &quot;Slim Chance&quot;. They also shared their recovery story in a chapter in a celebrity addiction book called &quot;Feeding the Fame&quot;.

The twins&#x27; first health and fitness book, &quot;Dying To Be Healthy: A Breakthrough Diet, Nutrition and Self Help Guide&quot; (1999), tells the story of their struggles with eating disorders and how they overcame it. Their second book, &quot;The Eco Anti-Diet, Plus Confession&quot; (2006), helps people understand how to be &quot;eco and animal friendly&quot; while being healthy and fit. 100% of the proceeds of the books go to animal charities.

===Miscellaneous===
By the year 2000 the twins began using their modeling career to help show support and draw focus on other issues they felt important, including publishing books on fitness and health issues, showing their support for the military with their patriotic images and words of support, and animal rights.

==Animal activism==

===Early years===
According to the twins, their interest in animal activism began in childhood, after experiencing, at their father&#x27;s ranch, animals they&#x27;d befriended and named would end up going to slaughter. In response, they drafted a heartfelt manifesto they called &quot;Civil Rights for Animals&quot;.

===Website===
The twins founded a website for animal activism called &quot;TheKittyLiberationFront.org&quot;, which has now become &quot;TwinBunnies.com&quot;, and help animal charities and rescue groups worldwide, volunteer with shelters for walking and rehabilitating dogs, participate in the TNR (Trap, Neuter and Return). They made a calendar featuring shelter animals called &quot;Pinup Pets&quot;, which was to support the hurricane animal rescue efforts (as seen in their documentary &quot;Your Mommy Kills Animals&quot;).

In a 2009 article by Fox News called the twins &quot;the Willie Nelson of pin-up girls&quot;, interviewing the twins where they spoke of how they (the twins) use their &quot;seven and a half minutes each of fame&quot; to speak out for animals. They participate in animal protests, such as anti-pet shops, anti-puppy mill, anti-circus, and anti-animal experimentation (vivisection) and are vegan. They held a vigil for pets lost during the pet food poisoning that occurred that same year. They also help lobby animal bills, such as the pet food safety bill.

===Wild horses===
In 2009 they became very active in lobbying in favor of the ROAM act for wild horses along with Willie Nelson, and continued their support speaking openly about the horse slaughter ban, the ban on de-clawing and the fight against factory farms and animal cruelty.

===Marine life===
In 2010 they helped bring public awareness to the ban on seal hunting in Canada by doing a media blitz to help end the brutality of seal hunting, the dangers to the sea turtles and other endangered species affected by the BP oil spill, and helped lobby and pass HR5566, the Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act Bill (banning violent images against animals on websites).

===Film and video===
The Twins use their celebrity status in every way they can including offering their images up in posters displaying their &quot;wacky humor and good looks&quot;, such as their 2010 posters to support causes such as the Anti Fur movie &quot;Skin Trade&quot; and the cruelty that happens in the dairy industry in the documentary &quot;Earthlings&quot;.=, and their 2011 covers and featured articles in &quot;True Cowboy Magazine&quot; and their continuing fight to save the wild horses (February and April 2011 issues).

===Other efforts===
The twins participate in animal rescue projects. In 2011, they worked the Animal Welfare Institute to support the ban on horse slaughter. and appeared in the documentary &quot;The Petition&quot; about the issue.

====Finding Luka Magnotta====
In 2012, the twins spearheaded a movement to track down a person posting online videos of killing kittens, believed to be Luka Magnotta. They have been searching for him since 2008. Their search ended after his capture in 2012.

<text>In mathematics, the Fredholm integral equation is an integral equation whose solution gives rise to Fredholm theory, the study of Fredholm kernels and Fredholm operators. The integral equation was studied by Ivar Fredholm. A useful method to solve such equations, the Adomian decomposition method, is due to George Adomian.

==Equation of the first kind==

A Fredholm equation is an integral equation in which the term containing the kernel function (defined below) has constants as integration limits. A closely related form is the Volterra integral equation which has variable integral limits.

An inhomogeneous Fredholm equation of the first kind is written as

and the problem is, given the continuous kernel function formula_1 and the function formula_2, to find the function formula_3.

An important case of these types of equation is the case when the kernel is a function only of the difference of its arguments, namely formula_4, and the limits of integration are ±∞, then the right hand side of the equation can be rewritten as a convolution of the functions formula_1 and formula_3 and therefore, formally, the solution is given by
:formula_7
where formula_8 and formula_9 are the direct and inverse Fourier transforms, respectively. This case would not be typically included under the umbrella of Fredholm integral equations, a name that is usually reserved for when the integral operator defines a compact operator (convolution operators on non-compact groups are non-compact, since, in general, the spectrum of the operator of convolution with formula_1 contains the range of formula_11, which is usually a non-countable set, whereas compact operators have discrete countable spectra).

==Equation of the second kind==
An inhomogeneous Fredholm equation of the second kind is given as
Given the kernel formula_12, and the function formula_13, the problem is typically to find the function formula_14.

A standard approach to solving this is to use iteration, amounting to the resolvent formalism; written as a series, the solution is known as the Liouville–Neumann series.

==General theory==
The general theory underlying the Fredholm equations is known as Fredholm theory. One of the principal results is that the kernel yields a compact operator. Compactness may be shown by invoking equicontinuity. As an operator, it has a spectral theory that can be understood in terms of a discrete spectrum of eigenvalues that tend to 0.

==Applications==
Fredholm equations arise naturally in the theory of signal processing, for example as the famous spectral concentration problem popularized by David Slepian. The operators involved are the same as linear filters. They also commonly arise in linear forward modeling and inverse problems. In physics, the solution of such integral equations allows for experimental spectra to be related to various underlying distributions, for instance the mass distribution of polymers in a polymeric melt,
 or the distribution of relaxation times in the system. 
In addition, Fredholm integral equations also arise in fluid mechanics problems involving hydrodynamic interactions near finite-sized elastic interfaces.

A specific application of Fredholm equation is the generation of photo-realistic images in computer graphics, in which the Fredholm equation is used to model light transport from the virtual light sources to the image plane. The Fredholm equation is often called the rendering equation in this context.
