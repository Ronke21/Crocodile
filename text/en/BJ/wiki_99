<text>A noria (, &quot;nā‘ūra&quot;, plural &quot;nawāʿīr&quot;, from , &quot;nā‘orā&quot;, lit. &quot;growler&quot;) is a hydropowered &quot;scoop wheel&quot; used to lift water into a small aqueduct, either for the purpose of irrigation or to supply water to cities and villages.

== Name and meaning ==

=== Etymology ===
The English word &quot;noria&quot; is derived via Spanish &quot;noria&quot; from Arabic &quot;nā‘ūra&quot; (ناعورة), which comes from the Arabic verb meaning to &quot;groan&quot; or &quot;grunt&quot;, in reference to the sound it made when turning.

===&quot;Noria&quot; versus &quot;saqiyah&quot;===
The term &quot;noria&quot; is commonly used for devices which use the power of moving water to turn the wheel. For devices powered by animals, the usual term is &quot;saqiyah&quot; or &quot;saqiya&quot;. Other types of similar devices are grouped under the name of chain pumps. However, the names of traditional water-raising devices used in the Middle East, India, Spain and other areas are often used loosely and overlappingly, or vary depending on region. Al-Jazari&#x27;s book on mechanical devices, for example, groups the water-driven wheel and several other types of water-lifting devices under the general term &quot;saqiya&quot;. In Spain, by contrast, the term &quot;noria&quot; is used for both types of wheels, whether powered by animals or water current.

==Function==

The noria performs the function of moving water from a lower elevation to a higher elevation, using the energy derived from the flow of a river. It consists of a large, narrow undershot water wheel whose rim is made up of a series of containers or compartments which lift water from the river to an aqueduct at the top of the wheel. Its concept is similar to the modern hydraulic ram, which also uses the power of flowing water to pump some of the water out of the river.

Traditional norias may have pots, buckets or tubes attached directly to the periphery of the wheel, in effect sakias powered by flowing water rather than by animals or motors. For some the buckets themselves form the driving surfaces, for most the buckets are separate to the water wheels and attached on one side. More modern types can be built up compartments. All types are configured to discharge the lifted water sideways to a channel. For a modern noria in Steffisburg, Switzerland, the designers have uniquely connected the two functional wheels not directly but via a pair of cog wheels. This allows individual variation of speeds, diameters, and water levels.

Unlike the water wheels found in watermills, a noria does not provide mechanical power to any other process. A few historical norias were hybrids, consisting of waterwheels assisted secondarily by animal power. There is at least one known instance where a noria feeds seawater into a saltern.

==History==
Paddle-driven water-lifting wheels had appeared in ancient Egypt by the 4th century BC. According to John Peter Oleson, both the compartmented wheel and the hydraulic noria appeared in Egypt by the 4th century BC, with the saqiyah being invented there a century later. This is supported by archeological finds in the Faiyum, where the oldest archeological evidence of a water wheel has been found, in the form of a saqiyah dating back to the 3rd century BC. A papyrus dating to the 2nd century BC also found in the Faiyum mentions a water wheel used for irrigation, a 2nd-century BC fresco found at Alexandria depicts a compartmented saqiyah, and the writings of Callixenus of Rhodes mention the use of a saqiyah in the Ptolemaic Kingdom during the reign of Pharaoh Ptolemy IV Philopator in the late 3rd century BC.

The undershot water wheel and overshot water wheel, both animal- and water-driven, and with either a compartmented body (Latin &quot;tympanum&quot;) or a compartmented rim, were used by Hellenistic engineers between the 3rd and 2nd century BC. In 1st century BC, Roman architect Vitruvius described the function of the noria. Around 300, the Romans replaced the wooden compartments with separate, attached ceramic pots that were tied to the outside of an open-framed wheel, thereby creating the noria.

During the Islamic Golden Age, norias were adopted from classical antiquity by Muslim engineers, who made improvements to the noria. For example, the flywheel mechanism used to smooth out the delivery of power from a driving device to a driven machine, was invented by ibn Bassal (fl. 1038–1075) of al-Andalus, who pioneered the use of the flywheel in the noria and saqiyah. In 1206, Ismail al-Jazari introduced the use of the carank in the noria and saqiya, and the concept of minimizing was implied for the purpose of maximising their efficiency.

Muslim engineers used norias to discharge water into aqueducts which carried the water to towns and fields. The norias of Hama, for example, were in diameter and are still used in modern times (although currently only serving aesthetic purposes). The largest wheel has 120 water collection compartments and could raise more than 95 litres of water per minute. In the 10th century, Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi&#x27;s &quot;Al-Hawi&quot; describes a noria in Iraq that could lift as much as 153,000 litres per hour, or 2550 litres per minute. This is comparable to the output of modern norias in East Asia, which can lift up to 288,000 litres per hour, or 4800 litres per minute.

In the late 13th century the Marinid sultan Abu Yaqub Yusuf built an enormous noria, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Grand Noria&quot;, in order to provide water for the vast Mosara Garden he created in Fez, Morocco. Its construction began in 1286 and was finished the next year. The noria, designed by an Andalusian engineer named Ibn al-Hajj, measured 26 metres in diameter and 2 metres wide. The wheel was made of wood but covered in copper, fitted into a stone structure adjoined to a nearby city gate. After the decline of the Marinids both the gardens and the noria fell into neglect; the wheel of the noria reportedly disappeared in 1888, leaving only remains of the stone base.

Numerous norias were also built in Al-Andalus, during the Islamic period of the Iberian Peninsula (8th-15th centuries), and continued to be built by Christian Spanish engineers afterwards. The most famous are the Albolafia in Cordoba (of uncertain date, partly reconstructed today), along the Guadalquivir River, and a former noria in Toledo, along the Tagus River. According to al-Idrisi, the Toledo noria was especially large and could raise water from the river to an aqueduct over 40 meters above it, which then supplied water to the city. Norias and similar devices were also used on vast scale in some parts of Spain for agricultural purposes. The rice plantations of Valencia were said to have 8000 norias, while Mallorca had over 4000 animal-driven saqiyas which were in use up until the beginning of the 20th century. The Alcantarilla Noria near Murcia, a noria built in the 15th century under Spanish Christian rule, is one of the better-known examples to have survived to the present-day.

<text>Inia is a genus of river dolphins from South America, containing one to four species.

==Taxonomy==

The genus was described by Alcide d&#x27;Orbigny in 1834 when &quot;Delphinus geoffrensis&quot;, described by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1817, was recognized to be a unique taxon. D&#x27;Orbigny also described &quot;Inia boliviensis&quot; as type species of the genus. A 1998 classification listed a single species, &quot;Inia geoffrensis&quot;, in the genus &quot;Inia&quot;, with three recognized subspecies. Most of the scientific community accepted this single species classification, as does the IUCN. As of 2016 the Committee on Taxonomy of the Society for Marine Mammalogy considers the genus &quot;Inia&quot; to contain one species with only two subspecies: the Bolivian (&quot;I. g. boliviensis&quot;) and the Amazon (&quot;I. g. geoffrensis)&quot; subspecies. In 2014, the population in the Araguaia-Tocantins basin was proposed to define an additional species, &quot;Inia araguaiaensis&quot;, but this remains debated. The American Society of Mammalogists recognizes the highest number of species at four, although this is only tentative, pending further studies which could either confirm or deny the classification.

<text>Roigheim () is a small municipality in Southwest Germany, in Heilbronn County, situated along the Seckach river. With approximately 1,400 inhabitants, Roigheim is the smallest independent community in the German state (Bundesland) Baden-Württemberg. It is also the home of Pucaro Elektro-Isolierstoffe GmbH.

== History ==
Archeologists have found remains that date back to the Stone Age. The first proof of a settlement comes from the Roman Empire at around 150 AD. The first time Roigheim was mentioned in a chronicle was in 1110 as Rohinkheim. In 1287 the small village became part of the area of the duke of Hohenlohe and only in 1504 it was bequeathed to Württemberg. It changed hands again in 1521 when it was given to the bishop of Würzburg. On 10 May 1719 there was a devastating fire in which 115 houses burned down. 
During most of its early history, the majority of the population was working the many farms. The moderate climate allowed the farming on the surrounding hillsides. In the 19th century a paper mill and a gypsum factory were built. The former continues to exist today as a factory for manufacturing insulation material for power plants with the name of Pucaro. 
Roigheim survived World War I relatively unharmed. World War II, however, brought the village closer to the front. In 1945 there were 356 refugees placed in Roigheim and about 50 foreign prisoners working in the gypsum factory. 
From Tuesday 3 April 1945 Roigheim was occupied by the Americans and the village became part of the American occupation zone. On 6 May 1946 there was the first election after the war but the people of Roigheim, still deeply rooted in traditional ideas, were not yet true democrats. The mayor, Christian Hübler, who was elected was only a pawn to be replaced by the former mayor, Eugen Reichert. Reichert had not been allowed to run for office in 1946 due to U.S. policy but after the three years had passed, in 1948, Hübler stepped down and was replaced by Reichert.

== Origin of the name ==

There are two versions for the origin of the name Roigheim. One story says that Roigheim comes from the Alemannic warrior Roho who is supposed to have settled what he then named Rohingen before 500. When the Franconians conquered the villages they renamed it Rohinkheim. The second story claims that the founder of Roigheim was called Rohink. As he was a Franconian, he named the village Rohinkheim, heim being the customary ending for Franconian villages.

== Facts and figures ==
Roigheim&#x27;s area consists of 46% farm land, 32% wood, 4% waste land and water, 8% settled terrain, and 10% pastures (1980).
In 1992 there were 72% Protestant-Lutheran, 18% Catholics, and 10% rest. This is a great contrast to 1907 when 98% were Protestant-Lutheran and 2% Catholic.
The population has also experienced great change. In 1939 only 935 people were living in Roigheim. After that date the population increased rapidly to 1,620 in 1960 when it peaked. In 1992 the population had receded slightly to 1,498. 
In 1993, 6% of the population were citizens of other countries than Germany.

<doc id="374379" wikidata="Q2123883" url="?curid=374379" title="Orcinus">
<text>Orcinus is a genus of Delphinidae, the family of carnivorous marine mammals known as dolphins. It includes the largest delphinid species, &quot;Orcinus orca&quot;, known as the orca or killer whale. Two extinct species are recognised, &quot;Orcinus paleorca&quot; and &quot;O. citoniensis&quot;, describing fossilised remains of the genus. The other extinct species &quot;O. meyeri&quot; is disputed.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Orcinus&quot; was published by Leopold Fitzinger in 1860, its type species is the orca named by Linnaeus in 1758 as &quot;Delphinus orca&quot;. Taxonomic arrangements of delphinids published by workers before and after Fitzinger, such as John Edward Gray as &quot;Orca&quot; in 1846 and &quot;Orca&quot; (&quot;Gladiator&quot;) in 1870, are recognized as synonyms of &quot;Orcinus&quot;. The descriptions of species as &quot;Orcinus glacialis&quot; Berzin and Vladimirov, 1983 and &quot;Orcinus nanus&quot; Mikhalev and Ivashin, 1981 are considered synonyms of &quot;Orcinus orca&quot;, the existing species of orca.

International Code of Zoological Nomenclature mentions that the name &quot;orca&quot; originates from Latin word &quot;orca&quot;, which means a large-bellied pot, and &quot;Orcinus&quot; is a derived word formed by adding a masculine suffix to it. This comes from Latin &quot;orca&quot; used by Ancient Romans for these animals, possibly borrowing Ancient Greek (&quot;óryx&quot;) which referred (among other things) to a whale species, perhaps a narwhal. As part of the family Delphinidae, the species is more closely related to other oceanic dolphins than to other whales.

The published names for the genus and their relationship to other delphinids combined epithets such as &quot;orca, grampus, gladiator&quot; and &quot;orcinus&quot; throughout the nineteenth century. The instability of this uncertain synonymy was complicated by the repetition of mistakes, a lack of specimens and contradictory descriptions, especially by J. E. Gray. The beaching of whales in Eastern Australia (a female and male &quot;Grampus griseus&quot;) prompted a taxonomic revision in 1933, the authors Tom Iredale and Ellis Troughton proposed that the extensive use of &quot;Grampus&quot; be conserved as the generic name of orca (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;) and that a new genus named &quot;Grampidelphis&quot; be established for Rissos dolphin (&quot;Grampus&quot;); the general stability of current species names emerged after the publication of the Philip Hershkovitz&#x27;s &quot;Catalog of Living Whales&quot; (US National Museum, 1966).

The type of the genus is &quot;Delphinus orca&quot;, published by Linnaeus in the 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The type locality was named as &quot;Oceano Europaeo&quot;.

== Description ==
A genus of carnivorous marine mammals, cetaceans of the delphinid family, with teeth in the upper and lower jaws. They possess a large brain which is informed by sophisticated auditory and echolocation techniques. The existing population, known as orca or killer whale, are a well known apex predator readily distinguished by their great size, 7 to 10 metres long, and mostly black and white coloring. These are highly intelligent and gregarious animals, able to communicate, educate, and cooperate in hunting the largest marine animals. The ecotypes within this species complex may coexist in a region, with resident and transient pods being sympatric, but these are known to be genetically isolated. Distinctions within the living &quot;Orcinus&quot; population are often observed in unique social behaviours, their cultures, which provided a significant evolutionary advantage in moving from a diet of cephlapods and fish to other mammals.

The fossil remains of &quot;Orcinus&quot; species are frequently teeth, deposited during the Pliocene, especially in Italy. &quot;Orcinus citoniensis&quot; is known by a well preserved skull and jaw. This specimen was an animal smaller than the orca, around 4 metres in length, and possessed a greater number of proportionally smaller teeth. 

The diet of modern orca is wide-ranging, although some ecotypes may be specialist fishers in a local range. Most delphinids feed on cephlapods, squid and octopuses, and earlier &quot;Orcinus&quot; species are thought to have also exploited this resource. The great size of orcas may have been the result of feeding &#x27;up the foodchain&#x27;, but the ability to prey on other mammals and the largest whales is proposed instead to be the result of exaptation. The social structure of orcas involves strategems that allow a pod to overcome animals greater in size than the individuals, whereas other great marine predators, such as &quot;Otodus megalodon&quot;, likely exceeded the size of their targets.

== Distribution ==
Fossil evidence of &quot;Orcinus&quot; species occur in a temporal range of 3.6 million years ago until the present day. The most ancient species &quot;Orcinus meyeri&quot; refers to fossils of a partial jaw and teeth located at the early Miocene horizon of a site near Stockach in Germany.

== Classification ==
The classification of &quot;Orcinus&quot; within subfamilies of delphinids may be summarised as:
* Delphinidae
** Delphininae
** Lissodelphininae
** Globicephalinae
** Orcininae
*** &quot;Orcinus&quot;
**** &quot;Orcinus citoniensis&quot; Capellini, 1883.
**** &quot;Orcinus meyeri&quot; J. F. Brandt, 1873.
**** &quot;Orcinus orca&quot; = &quot;Delphinus orca&quot; Linnaeus, 1758. The existing population, a complex predicted to include cryptic species and subspecies
**** &quot;Orcinus paleorca&quot; H. Matsumoto, 1937.
**Subfamily &quot;incertae sedis&quot; (&quot;Lagenorhynchus albirostris&quot;, &quot;Lagenorhynchus acutus&quot;)

The extant population is considered as a single species, although previously recognised diversity of orca populations suggests a number of cryptic species and subspecies may be recognised.
Other members of Orcininae were moved to Globicephalinae, and the relation of &quot;Orcinus&quot; with other dolphins is unknown.

<doc id="374385" wikidata="Q853133" url="?curid=374385" title="Creative problem-solving">
<text>Creative problem-solving (CPS) is the mental process of searching for an original and previously unknown solution to a problem. To qualify, the solution must be novel and reached independently. The creative problem-solving process was originally developed by Alex Osborn and Sid Parnes. Creative problem solving (CPS) is a way of using creativity to develop new ideas and solutions to problems. The process is based on separating divergent and convergent thinking styles, so that one can focus their mind on creating at the first stage, and then evaluating at the second stage.

== Creative solution types ==
The process of creative problem-solving usually begins with defining the problem. This may lead to finding a simple non-creative solution, a textbook solution, or discovering prior solutions developed by other individuals. If the discovered solution is sufficient, the process may then be abandoned.

A creative solution will often have distinct characteristics that include using only existing components, or the problematic factor, as the basis for the solution. However, a change of perspective may in many cases be helpful. A solution may also be considered creative if readily available components can be used to solve the problem within a short time limit.

If a creative solution has a broad application, such that the usage goes beyond the original intent, it may be referred to as an innovative solution, or an innovation (some innovations may also be considered an invention).
== Techniques and tools ==
Many techniques and tools employed for creating effective solutions to a problem are described in creativity techniques and problem-solving articles.

=== Creative problem-solving technique categories ===
* Mental state shift and cognitive re-framing: Changing one&#x27;s focus away from active problem-solving and towards a creative solution set.
* Multiple idea facilitation: Increasing the quantity of fresh ideas based on the belief that a greater number of ideas will raise the chances that one of these is valuable. This may include randomly selecting an idea (such as choosing a word from a list) and thinking about its similarities to the situation. In turn, this random act may inspire a related idea that would lead to a solution.
* Inducing a change of perspective: Efficiently entering a fresh perspective may result in a solution that thereby becomes obvious. This is especially useful for solving particularly challenging problems. Many techniques to this end involve identifying independent dimensions that differentiate closely associated concepts. Differentiating concepts help overcome a tendency to use oversimplified associative thinking, in which two related concepts are so closely associated that their differences are overlooked.

== Idea generation techniques ==
* Brainstorming: Brainstorming is an idea generation method invented by Alex Osborn and further developed by Charles Hutchison Clark. Brainstorming aims to encourage the generation of new and unusual ideas in a group of people. Alex Osborn based his development of brainstorming on the Indian technique Prai-Barshana, which has been around for about 400 years. He named brainstorming after the idea of this method, namely &quot;using the brain to storm a problem.&quot;
* Creative Thinking: Coming up with ideas, especially innovative ideas, needs creativity and can be supported by certain creativity techniques. The creativity process is usually applied through a person, product, process, and place. Thus, creativity means that a creative person develops great ideas and novel products through a creative process in a creative environment.
Creativity processes use these influencing factors as they support the search for ideas, problem solving and evaluation, and selection of ideas via rules, a group of people, and a creative process.
* Design thinking: Design thinking is an approach to problem-solving and ideation process that works through four key elements.

# The user as the starting point
# Interdisciplinary team
# Iterative process
# Creative environment. In the design thinking process, the &quot;&#x27;customer&#x27;s needs&quot; are first determined through an iterative process and a question is defined, then creative solutions and ideas are generated through brainstorming and visualized via prototypes for user feedback.
* Complex Opportunity Recognition Techniques: Opportunity Recognition describes the identification of opportunities to generate growth for companies. The different idea generation techniques of opportunity recognition are based either on the market, the company, or the company&#x27;s environment. In order for this approach to be suitable for young companies, it must fulfill the following attributes:

# Not too resource-intensive
# Suitable for workshops
# High growth potential
# Don&#x27;t require existing structures or certain age of the company

<doc id="374388" wikidata="Q408887" url="?curid=374388" title="Uranium hexafluoride">
<text>Uranium hexafluoride, sometimes called hex, is an inorganic compound with the formula . Uranium hexafluoride is a volatile, toxic white solid that is used in the process of enriching uranium, which produces fuel for nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons.

==Preparation==
Uranium dioxide is converted with hydrofluoric acid (HF) to uranium tetrafluoride:
In samples contaminated with uranium trioxide, the oxyfluoride is produced in the HF step:
The resulting is subsequently oxidized with fluorine to give the hexafluoride:

==Properties==

=== Physical properties ===
At atmospheric pressure, sublimes at 56.5 °C.

The solid-state structure was determined by neutron diffraction at 77 K and 293 K.

===Chemical properties===
UF6 reacts with water, releasing hydrofluoric acid. The compound reacts with aluminium, forming a surface layer of  that resists any further reaction from the compound. 

Uranium hexafluoride is a mild oxidant. It is a Lewis acid as evidenced by its binding to form heptafluorouranate(VI), .

Polymeric uranium(VI) fluorides containing organic cations have been isolated and characterized by X-ray diffraction.

==Application in the fuel cycle==

As one of the most volatile compounds of uranium, uranium hexafluoride is relatively convenient to process and is used in both of the main uranium enrichment methods, namely gaseous diffusion and the gas centrifuge method. Since the triple point of ; 64 °C(147 °F; 337 K) and 152 kPa (22 psi; 1.5 atm); is close to ambient conditions, phase transitions can be achieved with little thermodynamic work.

Fluorine has only a single naturally occurring stable isotope, so isotopologues of differ in their molecular weight based solely on the uranium isotope present. This difference is the basis for the physical separation of isotopes in enrichment.

All the other uranium fluorides are nonvolatile solids that are coordination polymers.

The conversion factor for the isotopologue of (&quot;hex&quot;) to &quot;U mass&quot; is 0.676.

Gaseous diffusion requires about 60 times as much energy as the gas centrifuge process: gaseous diffusion-produced nuclear fuel produces 25 times more energy than is used in the diffusion process, while centrifuge-produced fuel produces 1,500 times more energy than is used in the centrifuge process.

In addition to its use in enrichment, uranium hexafluoride has been used in an advanced reprocessing method (fluoride volatility), which was developed in the Czech Republic. In this process, spent nuclear fuel is treated with fluorine gas to transform the oxides or elemental metals into a mixture of fluorides. This mixture is then distilled to separate the different classes of material. Some fission products form nonvolatile fluorides which remain as solids and can then either be prepared for storage as nuclear waste or further processed either by solvation-based methods or electrochemically.

Uranium enrichment produces large quantities of depleted uranium hexafluoride (D or D-) as a waste product. The long-term storage of D- presents environmental, health, and safety risks because of its chemical instability. When is exposed to moist air, it reacts with the water in the air to produce (uranyl fluoride) and HF (hydrogen fluoride) both of which are highly corrosive and toxic. In 2005, 686,500 tonnes of D- was housed in 57,122 storage cylinders located near Portsmouth, Ohio; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; and Paducah, Kentucky. Storage cylinders must be regularly inspected for signs of corrosion and leaks. The estimated lifetime of the steel cylinders is measured in decades.

== Accidents and disposal ==

There have been several accidents involving uranium hexafluoride in the US, including a cylinder-filling accident and material release at the Sequoyah Fuels Corporation in 1986 where an estimated 29 500 pounds of gaseous escaped. The U.S. government has been converting D to solid uranium oxides for disposal. Such disposal of the entire D stockpile could cost anywhere from $15 million to $450 million.

<text>Anthropocene is a term that has been used to refer to the period of time during which humanity has become a planetary force of change. It appears in scientific and social discourse, especially with respect to accelerating geophysical and biochemical changes that characterize the 20th and 21st centuries on Earth. Originally a proposal for a new geological epoch following the Holocene, it was rejected as such in 2024 by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) and the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS).

The term has been used in research relating to Earth&#x27;s oceans, geology, geomorphology, landscape, limnology, hydrology, ecosystems and climate. The effects of human activities on Earth can be seen for example in biodiversity loss and climate change. Various start dates for the Anthropocene have been proposed, ranging from the beginning of the Neolithic Revolution (12,000–15,000 years ago), to as recently as the 1960s. The biologist Eugene F. Stoermer is credited with first coining and using the term &quot;anthropocene&quot; informally in the 1980s; Paul J. Crutzen re-invented and popularized the term.

The Anthropocene Working Group (AWG) of the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS) of the ICS voted in April 2016 to proceed towards a formal golden spike (GSSP) proposal to define an Anthropocene epoch in the geologic time scale. The group presented the proposal to the International Geological Congress in August 2016.

In May 2019, the AWG voted in favour of submitting a formal proposal to the ICS by 2021. The proposal located potential stratigraphic markers to the mid-20th century. This time period coincides with the start of the Great Acceleration, a post-World War II time period during which global population growth, pollution and exploitation of natural resources have all increased at a dramatic rate. The Atomic Age also started around the mid-20th century, when the risks of nuclear wars, nuclear terrorism and nuclear accidents increased.

Twelve candidate sites were selected for the GSSP; the sediments of Crawford Lake, Canada were finally proposed, in July 2023, to mark the lower boundary of the Anthropocene, starting with the Crawfordian stage/age in 1950.

In March 2024, after 15 years of deliberation, the Anthropocene Epoch proposal of the AWG was voted down by a wide margin by the SQS, owing largely to its shallow sedimentary record and extremely recent proposed start date. The ICS and the IUGS later formally confirmed, by a near unanimous vote, the rejection of the AWG&#x27;s Anthropocene Epoch proposal for inclusion in the Geologic Time Scale. The IUGS statement on the rejection concluded: &quot;Despite its rejection as a formal unit of the Geologic Time Scale, Anthropocene will nevertheless continue to be used not only by Earth and environmental scientists, but also by social scientists, politicians and economists, as well as by the public at large. It will remain an invaluable descriptor of human impact on the Earth system.&quot;

==Development of the concept==

An early concept for the Anthropocene was the Noosphere by Vladimir Vernadsky, who in 1938 wrote of &quot;scientific thought as a geological force&quot;. Scientists in the Soviet Union appear to have used the term &quot;Anthropocene&quot; as early as the 1960s to refer to the Quaternary, the most recent geological period.

Ecologist Eugene F. Stoermer subsequently used &quot;Anthropocene&quot; with a different sense in the 1980s and the term was widely popularised in 2000 by atmospheric chemist Paul J. Crutzen, who regards the influence of human behavior on Earth&#x27;s atmosphere in recent centuries as so significant as to constitute a new geological epoch.

The term &quot;Anthropocene&quot; is informally used in scientific contexts. The Geological Society of America entitled its 2011 annual meeting: &quot;Archean to Anthropocene: The past is the key to the future&quot;. The new epoch has no agreed start-date, but one proposal, based on atmospheric evidence, is to fix the start with the Industrial Revolution 1780, with the invention of the steam engine. Other scientists link the new term to earlier events, such as the rise of agriculture and the Neolithic Revolution (around 12,000 years BP).

Evidence of relative human impact – such as the growing human influence on land use, ecosystems, biodiversity, and species extinction – is substantial; scientists think that human impact has significantly changed (or halted) the growth of biodiversity. Those arguing for earlier dates posit that the proposed Anthropocene may have begun as early as 14,000–15,000 years BP, based on geologic evidence; this has led other scientists to suggest that &quot;the onset of the Anthropocene should be extended back many thousand years&quot;; this would make the Anthropocene essentially synonymous with the current term, &quot;Holocene&quot;.

=== Anthropocene Working Group ===
In 2008, the Stratigraphy Commission of the Geological Society of London considered a proposal to make the Anthropocene a formal unit of geological epoch divisions. A majority of the commission decided the proposal had merit and should be examined further. Independent working groups of scientists from various geological societies began to determine whether the Anthropocene will be formally accepted into the Geological Time Scale.
In January 2015, 26 of the 38 members of the International Anthropocene Working Group published a paper suggesting the Trinity test on 16 July 1945 as the starting point of the proposed new epoch. However, a significant minority supported one of several alternative dates. A March 2015 report suggested either 1610 or 1964 as the beginning of the Anthropocene. Other scholars pointed to the diachronous character of the physical strata of the Anthropocene, arguing that onset and impact are spread out over time, not reducible to a single instant or date of start.

A January 2016 report on the climatic, biological, and geochemical signatures of human activity in sediments and ice cores suggested the era since the mid-20th century should be recognised as a geological epoch distinct from the Holocene.

The Anthropocene Working Group met in April 2016 to consolidate evidence supporting the argument for the &quot;Anthropocene&quot; as a true geologic epoch. Evidence was evaluated and the group voted to recommend &quot;Anthropocene&quot; as the new geological epoch in August 2016. 

In April 2019, the Anthropocene Working Group (AWG) announced that they would vote on a formal proposal to the International Commission on Stratigraphy, to continue the process started at the 2016 meeting. In May 2019, 29 members of the 34 person AWG panel voted in favour of an official proposal to be made by 2021. The AWG also voted with 29 votes in favour of a starting date in the mid 20th century. Ten candidate sites for a Global boundary Stratotype Section and Point have been identified, one of which will be chosen to be included in the final proposal. Possible markers include microplastics, heavy metals, or radioactive nuclei left by tests from thermonuclear weapons.

In November 2021, an alternative proposal that the Anthropocene is a geological event, not an epoch, was published and later expanded in 2022. This challenged the assumption underlying the case for the Anthropocene epoch – the idea that it is possible to accurately assign a precise date of start to highly diachronous processes of human-influenced Earth system change. The argument indicated that finding a single GSSP would be impractical, given human-induced changes in the Earth system occurred at different periods, in different places, and spread under different rates. Under this model, the Anthropocene would have many events marking human-induced impacts on the planet, including the mass extinction of large vertebrates, the development of early farming, land clearance in the Americas, global-scale industrial transformation during the Industrial Revolution, and the start of the Atomic Age. The authors are members of the AWG who had voted against the official proposal of a starting date in the mid-20th century, and sought to reconcile some of the previous models (including Ruddiman and Maslin proposals). They cited Crutzen&#x27;s original concept, arguing that the Anthropocene is much better and more usefully conceived of as an unfolding geological event, like other major transformations in Earth&#x27;s history such as the Great Oxidation Event.

In July 2023, the AWG chose Crawford Lake in Ontario, Canada as a site representing the beginning of the proposed new epoch. The sediment in that lake shows a spike in levels of plutonium from hydrogen bomb tests, a key marker the group chose to place the start of the Anthropocene in the 1950s, along with other elevated markers including carbon particles and nitrates from the burning of fossil fuels and widespread application of chemical fertilizers respectively. Had it been approved, the official declaration of the new Anthropocene epoch would have taken place in August 2024, and its first age may have been named Crawfordian after the lake.

=== Rejection in 2024 vote by IUGS ===
In March 2024, an internal vote was held by the IUGS: After nearly 15 years of debate, the proposal to ratify the Anthropocene had been defeated by a 12-to-4 margin, with 2 abstentions. These results were not out of a dismissal of human impact on the planet, but rather an inability to constrain the Anthropocene in a geological context. This is because the widely-adopted 1950 start date was found to be prone to recency bias. It also overshadowed earlier examples of human impacts, many of which happened in different parts of the world at different times. Although the proposal could be raised again, this would require the entire process of debate to start from the beginning. The results of the vote were officially confirmed by the IUGS and upheld as definitive later that month.

== Proposed starting point ==

===Industrial Revolution===
Crutzen proposed the Industrial Revolution as the start of Anthropocene. Lovelock proposes that the Anthropocene began with the first application of the Newcomen steam engine in 1712. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change takes the pre-industrial era (chosen as the year 1750) as the baseline related to changes in long-lived, well mixed greenhouse gases. Although it is apparent that the Industrial Revolution ushered in an unprecedented global human impact on the planet, much of Earth&#x27;s landscape already had been profoundly modified by human activities. The human impact on Earth has grown progressively, with few substantial slowdowns. A 2024 scientific perspective paper authored by a group of scientists led by William J. Ripple proposed the start of the Anthropocene around 1850, stating it is a &quot;compelling choice ... from a population, fossil fuel, greenhouse gasses, temperature, and land use perspective.&quot;

=== Mid 20th century (Great Acceleration) ===
In May 2019 the twenty-nine members of the Anthropocene Working Group (AWG) proposed a start date for the Epoch in the mid-20th century, as that period saw &quot;a rapidly rising human population accelerated the pace of industrial production, the use of agricultural chemicals and other human activities. At the same time, the first atomic-bomb blasts littered the globe with radioactive debris that became embedded in sediments and glacial ice, becoming part of the geologic record.&quot; The official start-dates, according to the panel, would coincide with either the radionuclides released into the atmosphere from bomb detonations in 1945, or with the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963.

=== First atomic bomb (1945) ===
The peak in radionuclides fallout consequential to atomic bomb testing during the 1950s is another possible date for the beginning of the Anthropocene (the detonation of the first atomic bomb in 1945 or the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963).

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Anthropocene&quot; is a combination of &quot;&quot; from the Ancient Greek () meaning &#x27;human&#x27; and &quot;&quot; from () meaning &#x27;new&#x27; or &#x27;recent&#x27;.

As early as 1873, the Italian geologist Antonio Stoppani acknowledged the increasing power and effect of humanity on the Earth&#x27;s systems and referred to an &#x27;anthropozoic era&#x27;.

==Nature of human effects==
===Biodiversity loss===
The human impact on biodiversity forms one of the primary attributes of the Anthropocene. Humankind has entered what is sometimes called the Earth&#x27;s sixth major extinction. Most experts agree that human activities have accelerated the rate of species extinction. The exact rate remains controversial – perhaps 100 to 1000 times the normal background rate of extinction.

Anthropogenic extinctions started as humans migrated out of Africa over 60,000 years ago. Increases in global rates of extinction have been elevated above background rates since at least 1500, and appear to have accelerated in the 19th century and further since. Rapid economic growth is considered a primary driver of the contemporary displacement and eradication of other species.

According to the 2021 &quot;Economics of Biodiversity&quot; review, written by Partha Dasgupta and published by the UK government, &quot;biodiversity is declining faster than at any time in human history.&quot; A 2022 scientific review published in &quot;Biological Reviews&quot; confirms that an anthropogenic sixth mass extinction event is currently underway. A 2022 study published in &quot;Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment&quot;, which surveyed more than 3,000 experts, states that the extinction crisis could be worse than previously thought, and estimates that roughly 30% of species &quot;have been globally threatened or driven extinct since the year 1500.&quot; According to a 2023 study published in &quot;Biological Reviews&quot; some 48% of 70,000 monitored species are experiencing population declines from human activity, whereas only 3% have increasing populations.

===Biogeography and nocturnality===
Studies of urban evolution give an indication of how species may respond to stressors such as temperature change and toxicity. Species display varying abilities to respond to altered environments through both phenotypic plasticity and genetic evolution. Researchers have documented the movement of many species into regions formerly too cold for them, often at rates faster than initially expected.

Permanent changes in the distribution of organisms from human influence will become identifiable in the geologic record. This has occurred in part as a result of changing climate, but also in response to farming and fishing, and to the accidental introduction of non-native species to new areas through global travel. The ecosystem of the entire Black Sea may have changed during the last 2000 years as a result of nutrient and silica input from eroding deforested lands along the Danube River.

Researchers have found that the growth of the human population and expansion of human activity has resulted in many species of animals that are normally active during the day, such as elephants, tigers and boars, becoming nocturnal to avoid contact with humans, who are largely diurnal.

===Climate change===
One geological symptom resulting from human activity is increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide () content. This signal in the Earth&#x27;s climate system is especially significant because it is occurring much faster, and to a greater extent, than previously. Most of this increase is due to the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas.


===Geomorphology===
Changes in drainage patterns traceable to human activity will persist over geologic time in large parts of the continents where the geologic regime is erosional. This involves, for example, the paths of roads and highways defined by their grading and drainage control. Direct changes to the form of the Earth&#x27;s surface by human activities (quarrying and landscaping, for example) also record human impacts.

It has been suggested that the deposition of calthemite formations exemplify a natural process which has not previously occurred prior to the human modification of the Earth&#x27;s surface, and which therefore represents a unique process of the Anthropocene. Calthemite is a secondary deposit, derived from concrete, lime, mortar or other calcareous material &quot;outside the cave environment&quot;. Calthemites grow on or under man-made structures (including mines and tunnels) and mimic the shapes and forms of cave speleothems, such as stalactites, stalagmites, flowstone &quot;etc&quot;.

===Stratigraphy===

====Sedimentological record====
Human activities, including deforestation and road construction, are believed to have elevated average total sediment fluxes across the Earth&#x27;s surface. However, construction of dams on many rivers around the world means the rates of sediment deposition in any given place do not always appear to increase in the Anthropocene. For instance, many river deltas around the world are actually currently starved of sediment by such dams, and are subsiding and failing to keep up with sea level rise, rather than growing.

====Fossil record====
Increases in erosion due to farming and other operations will be reflected by changes in sediment composition and increases in deposition rates elsewhere. In land areas with a depositional regime, engineered structures will tend to be buried and preserved, along with litter and debris. Litter and debris thrown from boats or carried by rivers and creeks will accumulate in the marine environment, particularly in coastal areas, but also in mid-ocean garbage patches. Such human-created artifacts preserved in stratigraphy are known as &quot;technofossils&quot;.

Changes in biodiversity will also be reflected in the fossil record, as will species introductions. An example cited is the domestic chicken, originally the red junglefowl &quot;Gallus gallus&quot;, native to south-east Asia but has since become the world&#x27;s most common bird through human breeding and consumption, with over 60 billion consumed annually and whose bones would become fossilised in landfill sites. Hence, landfills are important resources to find &quot;technofossils&quot;.

====Trace elements====
In terms of trace elements, there are distinct signatures left by modern societies. For example, in the Upper Fremont Glacier in Wyoming, there is a layer of chlorine present in ice cores from 1960&#x27;s atomic weapon testing programs, as well as a layer of mercury associated with coal plants in the 1980s.

From the late 1940s, nuclear tests have led to local nuclear fallout and severe contamination of test sites both on land and in the surrounding marine environment. Some of the radionuclides that were released during the tests are Cs, Sr, Pu, Pu, Am, and I. These have been found to have had significant impact on the environment and on human beings. In particular, Cs and Sr have been found to have been released into the marine environment and led to bioaccumulation over a period through food chain cycles. The carbon isotope C, commonly released during nuclear tests, has also been found to be integrated into the atmospheric CO, and infiltrating the biosphere, through ocean-atmosphere gas exchange. Increase in thyroid cancer rates around the world is also surmised to be correlated with increasing proportions of the I radionuclide.

The highest global concentration of radionuclides was estimated to have been in 1965, one of the dates which has been proposed as a possible benchmark for the start of the formally defined Anthropocene.

Human burning of fossil fuels has also left distinctly elevated concentrations of black carbon, inorganic ash, and spherical carbonaceous particles in recent sediments across the world. Concentrations of these components increases markedly and almost simultaneously around the world beginning around 1950.

=== Anthropocene markers ===
A marker that accounts for a substantial global impact of humans on the total environment, comparable in scale to those associated with significant perturbations of the geological past, is needed in place of minor changes in atmosphere composition.

A useful candidate for holding markers in the geologic time record is the pedosphere. Soils retain information about their climatic and geochemical history with features lasting for centuries or millennia. Human activity is now firmly established as the sixth factor of soil formation. Humanity affects pedogenesis directly by, for example, land levelling, trenching and embankment building, landscape-scale control of fire by early humans, organic matter enrichment from additions of manure or other waste, organic matter impoverishment due to continued cultivation and compaction from overgrazing. Human activity also affects pedogenesis indirectly by drift of eroded materials or pollutants. Anthropogenic soils are those markedly affected by human activities, such as repeated ploughing, the addition of fertilisers, contamination, sealing, or enrichment with artefacts (in the World Reference Base for Soil Resources they are classified as Anthrosols and Technosols). An example from archaeology would be dark earth phenomena when long-term human habitation enriches the soil with black carbon.

Anthropogenic soils are recalcitrant repositories of artefacts and properties that testify to the dominance of the human impact, and hence appear to be reliable markers for the Anthropocene. Some anthropogenic soils may be viewed as the &#x27;golden spikes&#x27; of geologists (Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point), which are locations where there are strata successions with clear evidences of a worldwide event, including the appearance of distinctive fossils. Drilling for fossil fuels has also created holes and tubes which are expected to be detectable for millions of years. The astrobiologist David Grinspoon has proposed that the site of the Apollo 11 Lunar landing, with the disturbances and artifacts that are so uniquely characteristic of our species&#x27; technological activity and which will survive over geological time spans could be considered as the &#x27;golden spike&#x27; of the Anthropocene.

An October 2020 study coordinated by University of Colorado at Boulder found that distinct physical, chemical and biological changes to Earth&#x27;s rock layers began around the year 1950. The research revealed that since about 1950, humans have doubled the amount of fixed nitrogen on the planet through industrial production for agriculture, created a hole in the ozone layer through the industrial scale release of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), released enough greenhouse gasses from fossil fuels to cause planetary level climate change, created tens of thousands of synthetic mineral-like compounds that do not naturally occur on Earth, and caused almost one-fifth of river sediment worldwide to no longer reach the ocean due to dams, reservoirs and diversions. Humans have produced so many millions of tons of plastic each year since the early 1950s that microplastics are &quot;forming a near-ubiquitous and unambiguous marker of Anthropocene&quot;. The study highlights a strong correlation between global human population size and growth, global productivity and global energy use and that the &quot;extraordinary outburst of consumption and productivity demonstrates how the Earth System has departed from its Holocene state since c. 1950 CE, forcing abrupt physical, chemical and biological changes to the Earth&#x27;s stratigraphic record that can be used to justify the proposal for naming a new epoch—the Anthropocene.&quot;

A December 2020 study published in &quot;Nature&quot; found that the total anthropogenic mass, or human-made materials, outweighs all the biomass on earth, and highlighted that &quot;this quantification of the human enterprise gives a mass-based quantitative and symbolic characterization of the human-induced epoch of the Anthropocene.&quot;

== Debates ==
Although the validity of &quot;Anthropocene&quot; as a scientific term remains disputed, its underlying premise, i.e., that humans have become a geological force, or rather, the dominant force shaping the Earth&#x27;s climate, has found traction among academics and the public. In an opinion piece for &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B&quot;, Rodolfo Dirzo, Gerardo Ceballos, and Paul R. Ehrlich write that the term is &quot;increasingly penetrating the lexicon of not only the academic socio-sphere, but also society more generally&quot;, and is now included as an entry in the Oxford English Dictionary. The University of Cambridge, as another example, offers a degree in Anthropocene Studies. In the public sphere, the term &quot;Anthropocene&quot; has become increasingly ubiquitous in activist, pundit, and political discourses. Some who are critical of the term &quot;Anthropocene&quot; nevertheless concede that &quot;For all its problems, [it] carries power.&quot; The popularity and currency of the word has led scholars to label the term a &quot;charismatic meta-category&quot; or &quot;charismatic mega-concept.&quot; The term, regardless, has been subject to a variety of criticisms from social scientists, philosophers, Indigenous scholars, and others.

The anthropologist John Hartigan has argued that due to its status as a charismatic meta-category, the term &quot;Anthropocene&quot; marginalizes competing, but less visible, concepts such as that of &quot;multispecies.&quot; The more salient charge is that the ready acceptance of &quot;Anthropocene&quot; is due to its conceptual proximity to the status quo – that is, to notions of human individuality and centrality.

Other scholars appreciate the way in which the term &quot;Anthropocene&quot; recognizes humanity as a geological force, but take issue with the indiscriminate way in which it does. Not all humans are equally responsible for the climate crisis. To that end, scholars such as the feminist theorist Donna Haraway and sociologist Jason Moore, have suggested naming the Epoch instead as the &quot;Capitalocene&quot;. Such implies capitalism as the fundamental reason for the ecological crisis, rather than just humans in general. However, according to philosopher Steven Best, humans have created &quot;hierarchical and growth-addicted societies&quot; and have demonstrated &quot;ecocidal proclivities&quot; long before the emergence of capitalism. Hartigan, Bould, and Haraway all critique what &quot;Anthropocene&quot; does as a term; however, Hartigan and Bould differ from Haraway in that they criticize the utility or validity of a geological framing of the climate crisis, whereas Haraway embraces it.

In addition to &quot;Capitalocene,&quot; other terms have also been proposed by scholars to trace the roots of the Epoch to causes other than the human species broadly. Janae Davis, for example, has suggested the &quot;Plantationocene&quot; as a more appropriate term to call attention to the role that plantation agriculture has played in the formation of the Epoch, alongside Kathryn Yusoff&#x27;s argument that racism as a whole is foundational to the Epoch. The Plantationocene concept traces &quot;the ways that plantation logics organize modern economies, environments, bodies, and social relations.&quot; In a similar vein, Indigenous studies scholars such as Métis geographer Zoe Todd have argued that the Epoch must be dated back to the colonization of the Americas, as this &quot;names the problem of colonialism as responsible for contemporary environmental crisis.&quot; Potawatomi philosopher Kyle Powys Whyte has further argued that the Anthropocene has been apparent to Indigenous peoples in the Americas since the inception of colonialism because of &quot;colonialism&#x27;s role in environmental change.&quot;

Other critiques of &quot;Anthropocene&quot; have focused on the genealogy of the concept. Todd also provides a phenomenological account, which draws on the work of the philosopher Sara Ahmed, writing: &quot;When discourses and responses to the Anthropocene are being generated within institutions and disciplines which are embedded in broader systems that act as de facto &#x27;white public space,&#x27; the academy and its power dynamics must be challenged.&quot; Other aspects which constitute current understandings of the concept of the &quot;Anthropocene&quot; such as the ontological split between nature and society, the assumption of the centrality and individuality of the human, and the framing of environmental discourse in largely scientific terms have been criticized by scholars as concepts rooted in colonialism and which reinforce systems of postcolonial domination. To that end, Todd makes the case that the concept of &quot;Anthropocene&quot; must be indigenized and decolonized if it is to become a vehicle of justice as opposed to white thought and domination.

Eco-philosopher David Abram, in a book chapter titled &#x27;Interbreathing in the Humilocene&#x27;, has proposed adoption of the term ‘Humilocene’ (the Epoch of Humility), which emphasizes an ethical imperative and ecocultural direction that human societies should take. The term plays with the etymological roots of the term ‘human’, thus connecting it back with terms such as humility, humus (the soil), and even a corrective sense of humiliation that some human societies should feel given their collective destructive impact on the earth.

===&quot;Early anthropocene&quot; model===
William Ruddiman has argued that the Anthropocene began approximately 8,000 years ago with the development of farming and sedentary cultures. At that point, humans were dispersed across all continents except Antarctica, and the Neolithic Revolution was ongoing. During this period, humans developed agriculture and animal husbandry to supplement or replace hunter-gatherer subsistence. Such innovations were followed by a wave of extinctions, beginning with large mammals and terrestrial birds. This wave was driven by both the direct activity of humans (e.g. hunting) and the indirect consequences of land-use change for agriculture. Landscape-scale burning by prehistoric hunter-gathers may have been an additional early source of anthropogenic atmospheric carbon. Ruddiman also claims that the greenhouse gas emissions in-part responsible for the Anthropocene began 8,000 years ago when ancient farmers cleared forests to grow crops.

Ruddiman&#x27;s work has been challenged with data from an earlier interglaciation (&quot;Stage 11&quot;, approximately 400,000 years ago) which suggests that 16,000 more years must elapse before the current Holocene interglaciation comes to an end, and thus the early anthropogenic hypothesis is invalid. Also, the argument that &quot;something&quot; is needed to explain the differences in the Holocene is challenged by more recent research showing that all interglacials are different.

=== Homogenocene ===
Homogenocene (from old Greek: , &quot;same&quot;; , &quot;kind&quot;; kainos-, &quot;new&quot;;) is a more specific term used to define our current epoch, in which biodiversity is diminishing and biogeography and ecosystems around the globe seem more and more similar to one another mainly due to invasive species that have been introduced around the globe either on purpose (crops, livestock) or inadvertently. This is due to the newfound globalism that humans participate in, as species traveling across the world to another region was not as easily possible in any point of time in history as it is today.

The term Homogenocene was first used by Michael Samways in his editorial article in the &quot;Journal of Insect Conservation&quot; from 1999 titled &quot;Translocating fauna to foreign lands: Here comes the Homogenocene.&quot;

The term was used again by John L. Curnutt in the year 2000 in &quot;Ecology&quot;, in a short list titled &quot;A Guide to the Homogenocene&quot;, which reviewed &quot;Alien species in North America and Hawaii: impacts on natural ecosystems&quot; by George Cox. Charles C. Mann, in his acclaimed book &quot;1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created&quot;, gives a bird&#x27;s-eye view of the mechanisms and ongoing implications of the homogenocene.

===Humanities===

The concept of the Anthropocene has also been approached via humanities such as philosophy, literature and art. In the scholarly world, it has been the subject of increasing attention through special journals, conferences, and disciplinary reports. The Anthropocene, its attendant timescale, and ecological implications prompt questions about death and the end of civilisation, memory and archives, the scope and methods of humanistic inquiry, and emotional responses to the &quot;end of nature&quot;. Some scholars have posited that the realities of the Anthropocene, including &quot;human-induced biodiversity loss, exponential increases in per-capita resource consumption, and global climate change,&quot; have made the goal of environmental sustainability largely unattainable and obsolete.

Historians have actively engaged the Anthropocene. In 2000, the same year that Paul Crutzen coined the term, world historian John McNeill published &quot;Something New Under the Sun&quot;, tracing the rise of human societies&#x27; unprecedented impact on the planet in the twentieth century. In 2001, historian of science Naomi Oreskes revealed the systematic efforts to undermine trust in climate change science and went on to detail the corporate interests delaying action on the environmental challenge. Both McNeill and Oreskes became members of the Anthropocene Working Group because of their work correlating human activities and planetary transformation.
===Popular culture===
* In 2019, the English musician Nick Mulvey released a music video on YouTube named &quot;In the Anthropocene&quot;. In cooperation with Sharp&#x27;s Brewery, the song was recorded on 105 vinyl records made of washed-up plastic from the Cornish coast.
* &quot;The Anthropocene Reviewed&quot; is a podcast and book by author John Green, where he &quot;reviews different facets of the human-centered planet on a five-star scale&quot;.
* Photographer Edward Burtynsky created &quot;The Anthropocene Project&quot; with Jennifer Baichwal and Nicholas de Pencier, which is a collection of photographs, exhibitions, a film, and a book. His photographs focus on landscape photography that captures the effects human beings have had on the earth. 
* In 2015, the American death metal band Cattle Decapitation released its seventh studio album titled &quot;The Anthropocene Extinction&quot;.
* In 2020, Canadian musician Grimes released her fifth studio album titled &quot;Miss Anthropocene&quot;. The name is also a pun on the feminine title &quot;Miss&quot; and the words &quot;misanthrope&quot; and &quot;Anthropocene.&quot;

<text>The Congregation of the Mission (), abbreviated CM and commonly called the Vincentians or Lazarists, is a Catholic society of apostolic life of pontifical right for men founded by Vincent de Paul. It is associated with the Vincentian Family, a loose federation of organizations that look to Vincent de Paul as their founder or patron.

== Mission ==
Inspired by the &quot;first mission&quot; of Chátillon-les-Dombes and Folleville, where he delivered his first mission sermon, St. Vincent de Paul discovered the need and importance of popular missions and general confessions. His concern to form a group of missionaries for the most abandoned areas of France was born in him, and in 1625 he founded the Congregation of the Mission as an apostolic society together with other priests, Anthony Portail, M. Belin, Francis de Coudray and John de la Salle. Years later, this mission found its motto in the passage in Luke&#x27;s gospel, &quot;Evangelizare pauperibus misit me&quot; (The Holy Spirit sent me to bring the Good News to the poor, Luke 4:18).

In 1633, motivated by that same Spirit, St. Vincent de Paul and St. Louise de Marillac founded the Company of the Daughters of Charity, a group of women dedicated to serving the &quot;poorest of the poor&quot;. Prayer and community life were essential elements of their vocation of service, with a characteristic spirit of humility, simplicity and charity.

==History==

The Congregation has its origin in the successful mission to the common people conducted by Vincent de Paul and five other priests on the estates of the Gondi family. More immediately it dates from 1624, when the little community acquired a permanent settlement in the &quot;Collège des Bons Enfants&quot; in Paris, which later became a seminary under the name of St. Firmin. The first missions of the Vincentians were in the suburbs of Paris and in Picardy and Champagne. 
Archiepiscopal recognition was obtained in 1626. By a papal bull on January 12, 1633, the society was constituted a congregation, with Vincent de Paul as its head. About the same time the canons regular of St. Victor handed over to the congregation their priory of Saint Lazare (formerly a lazar-house or leper hospital) in Paris, which led to its members being popularly known as &#x27;Lazarists&quot;.

Within a few years the Vincentians had acquired another house in Paris and set up other establishments throughout France; missions were also sent to Italy (1638), Tunis (1643), Algiers and Ireland (1646), Madagascar (1648), Poland (1651), and Turkey (1783). A bull of Alexander VII in April 1655 further confirmed the society; this was followed by a brief in September of the same year, regulating its constitution. The rules then adopted, which were framed on the model of those of the Jesuits, were published at Paris in 1668 under the title &quot;Regulae seu constitutiones communes congregationis missionis&quot;. Its special aims were the religious instruction of the poor, the training of the clergy, and foreign missions.

On the eve of the French Revolution, Saint Lazare was plundered by the mob and the congregation was later suppressed; it was restored by Napoleon in 1804 at the desire of Pius VII, abolished by him in 1809 in consequence of a quarrel with the pope, and again restored in 1816. The Vincentians were expelled from Italy in 1871 and from Germany in 1873.

The Vincentian province of Poland was singularly prosperous; at the date of its suppression in 1796 it possessed thirty-five establishments. The Congregation of the Mission was permitted to return in 1816, where it is very active. In Madagascar it had a mission from 1648 until 1674. In 1783 Vincentians were appointed to take the place of the Jesuits in the Levantine and Chinese missions; and in 1874 their establishments throughout the Ottoman Empire numbered sixteen. In addition, they established missions in Persia, Abyssinia, Mexico, the South American republics, Portugal, Spain, and Russia, some of which were later suppressed. In the same year they had fourteen establishments in the United States of America.

== Mother House ==
The Mother House (Maison Mère) is the successor of the first Mother House which was the former priory of Saint Lazare. This house, located at 95 rue de Sèvres, was the former residence of the Duke of Lorges, and was made available to the Congregation of the Mission by the French government in 1817. Finally, in 2006, the French State made the Congregation of the Mission the owner of the house and its grounds.

The Mother House consists of a series of buildings around a paved courtyard. The entrance is in the central neo-Renaissance style pavilion at the back of the courtyard. In a niche on the façade is a statue of Saint Vincent de Paul.

Currently, for the occasion of the 400th anniversary of the Congregation of the Mission, the Vincentians are renovating the Mother House, with the aim of accommodating those seeking spiritual enrichment, especially members of all branches of the Vincentian Family, pilgrims and people of faith.

== Vincentian Family ==
There are people who do not belong to groups or congregations of consecrated life, but who live the spirit of St. Vincent, his spirituality and charism; they are volunteers, they are in parishes, schools, hospitals and so many other places.

The spirituality of Vincent de Paul has influenced the foundation of other societies of apostolic life and even of some institutes of consecrated life which, in communion, form today what is called the Vincentian family.8 There are 170 congregations, with 2 million people involved, and groups of lay people, which have grown from a &quot;family&quot; to a &quot;movement&quot;, reaching almost 4 million people:

* the Daughters of Charity, founded by Vincent de Paul himself, with the help of Louise de Marillac in 1633,
* the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul of Novara, a religious congregation founded in 1773 in Italy,
* the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul of Majorca, founded in Spain in 1798,
* the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, founded by Jeanne Antide Touret in Canada in 1799,
* the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul of Gijzegem, founded in Belgium in 1818,
* the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul of Fulda, founded in Germany in 1835,
* the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul of Innsbruck, founded in Austria in 1835,
* the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul of Paderborn, founded in Germany in 1840,
* the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul of Hildesheim, founded in Germany in 1852,
* the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul of Freiburg, also foiunded in Germany in 1853,
* the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul of Halifax, founded in Canada,
* the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul of Zagreb, founded in the former Yugoslavia,
* the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul of the Prince of Palagonia, founded in Parmelo, Italy, in 1835,
* the Sisters of Providence of Kingston, founded in Canada,
* the Malabar Vincentians of the Syro-Malabar rite, founded in India in 1927,
* and the Vincentian laity, who share the work and spirituality of the Congregation of the Mission and of the various Vincentian congregations or societies. There are many Vincentian lay groups, among them the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Vincentian Marian Youth, the Miraculous Medal Association, the Volunteers of Charity and the members of the Conferences of St. Vincent de Paul.

==Present day==
In 2022, the Congregation of the Mission had 3,099 incorporated members, of whom 2,781 were priests. They have 476 houses, spread over five vice-provinces: Mozambique, Nigeria, Costa Rica and St. Cyril and Methodius (Ukraine), and thirty-seven provinces on five continents.

Its specific apostolate remains the evangelization of the poor and the formation of the clergy. , Tomaž Mavrič is the incumbent worldwide superior general of the Congregation of the Mission, elected during its general assembly on July 5, 2016.

===Opus Prize Finalist===
On August 30, 2007, The Catholic University of America, (with the Opus Prize 2004 Foundation, affiliated with The Opus Group), announced that it would award on November 8 a $1-million and two $100,000 Humanity prizes to finalist organizations which contributed to solve most persistent social problems: John Adams (of &quot;So Others Might Eat&quot; which serves the poor and homeless in Washington, DC); Stan Goetschalckx (founder and director of AHADI International Institute in Tanzania which educates refugees from Congo, Rwanda, and Burundi); and Bebot Carcellar of the Vincentian Missionaries Social Development Foundation. On November 8, 2007, David M. O&#x27;Connell, president of Catholic University, personally bestowed these Opus Prizes at the university&#x27;s Edward J. Pryzbyla University Center.

==Philippines==
In 2008 the Vincentian family marked 150 years in the Philippines, led by the provincial Bienvenido M. Disu, Gregorio L. Bañaga, President of Adamson University, and Archbishop Jesus Dosado of the Archdiocese of Ozamiz. The Philippine province has a deacon, 5 incorporated brothers, and 97 priests. A major work is the housing program for hundreds of families, especially those affected by demolitions and relocations along the Philippine North and South Railways tracks.

The CBCP Newsletter announced on July 10, 2008, the appointment of the Philippine Marcelo Manimtim as director of Paris-based Centre International de Formation. Manimtim is the first Asian to hold the office.

===Housing programs===
In 1991, Carcellar was assigned to Payatas. With his &quot;Planning for a new home, Systemic Change Strategy,&quot; he organized Philippine massive home constructions, which he began by a savings program at Payatas dumpsite. Carcellar&#x27;s &quot;The Homeless Peoples Federation Philippines&quot; provided slum dwellers of Iloilo City and Mandaue City with initiatives to survive poverty. In 2008 it promoted savings in Southeast Asia, since the Philippine Federation affiliated with an international network called &quot;Slum/Shack Dwellers International&quot;.

Another, younger Vincentian was also assigned by Cardinal Gaudencio Rosales as the Coordinator of the Housing Ministry of the Archdiocese of Manila.

===Vincentian Center for Social Responsibility===
On September 28, 2007, Philippine Vice President Noli De Castro welcomed the launching of the Vincentian Center for Social Responsibility by the Adamson University. The center intends to engage the Adamson&#x27;s academic community more deeply and directly in nation-building and to directly respond to Millennium Development Goals&#x27; poverty alleviation initiatives in the country. De Castro also cited the Adamson University and a Vincentian priest named Atilano &quot;Nonong&quot; Fajardo for their efforts in putting up the Vincentian Center.

The Vincentian Center for Social Responsibility is also responsible for the creation of the Vincentian Facilitators, the Academic Social Responsibility, the Academic Social Entrepreneurship, and the Academic Social Journalism at the Vincentian-owned Adamson University. Through the Vincentian Center, the movement towards academic social networking has become a reality in the university. It is also responsible for organizing the First Northville and Southville People&#x27;s Congress, consisting of around 750,000 relocatees from Metro Manila and the provinces of Cavite, Bulacan and Laguna.

==United States of America==
The Vincentians travelled to the United States in 1816 and two years later established St. Mary&#x27;s of the Barrens seminary. They founded Niagara University (1856), St. John&#x27;s University (1870), and DePaul University (1898).

The Eastern Province&#x27;s headquarters is located in Germantown, PA located next to the Basilica Shrine of the Miraculous Medal. The priests of this province serve in several parishes along the eastern sea board. The also founded and still run Niagara University along with St. John&#x27;s University (New York City). They also has a sub-province in Panama.

The Western Province of the USA has a mission in Kenya, where in conjunction with parish ministry water projects have been initiated to provide clean water to the people.

<text>Emanuel Sperner (9 December 1905 – 31 January 1980) was a German mathematician, best known for two theorems. He was born in Waltdorf (near Neiße, Upper Silesia, now Nysa, Poland), and died in Sulzburg-Laufen, West Germany. He was a student at Carolinum in Nysa and then Hamburg University where his advisor was Wilhelm Blaschke. He was appointed Professor in Königsberg in 1934, and subsequently held posts in a number of universities until 1974.

Sperner&#x27;s theorem, from 1928, says that the size of an antichain in the power set of an &quot;n&quot;-set (a Sperner family) is at most the middle binomial coefficient(s). It has several proofs and numerous generalizations, including the Sperner property of a partially ordered set.

Sperner&#x27;s lemma, from 1928, states that every Sperner coloring of a triangulation of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional simplex contains a cell colored with a complete set of colors. It was proven by Sperner to provide an alternate proof of a theorem of Lebesgue characterizing dimensionality of Euclidean spaces. It was later noticed that this lemma provides a direct proof of the Brouwer fixed-point theorem without explicit use of homology.

Sperner&#x27;s students included Kurt Leichtweiss and Gerhard Ringel.

<text>Neophocaena is a genus of porpoise native to the Indian and Pacific oceans, as well as the freshwater habitats of the Yangtze River basin in China. They are commonly known as finless porpoises. Genetic studies indicate that &quot;Neophocaena&quot; is the most basal living member of the porpoise family.

There are three species in this genus:

== Description ==
The finless porpoises are the only porpoises to lack a true dorsal fin. Instead there is a low ridge covered in thick skin bearing several lines of tiny tubercles. In addition, the forehead is unusually steep compared with those of other porpoises. With fifteen to twenty-one teeth in each jaw, they also have, on average, fewer teeth than other porpoises, although there is some overlap, and this is a not a reliable means of distinguishing them. Finless porpoises in Ariake Sound-Tachibana Bay showed ontogenctic and seasonal variations in diet. The mean length at weaning was estimated to be 101 cm, corresponding to approximately 6 months of age. Calves fed on small-sized demersal fish and cephalopods.

<text>The snubfin dolphins (&quot;Orcaella&quot;) are a genus of cetaceans containing two members: the Irrawaddy dolphin (&quot;Orcaella brevirostris&quot;) and the Australian snubfin dolphin (&quot;Orcaella heinsohni&quot;). The genus was long believed to be monotypic with the only species being the Irrawaddy dolphin; however, in 2005, supposed Irrawaddy dolphin populations inhabiting the Australian/New Guinean regions were found to be significantly different and were declared a separate new species named the Australian snubfin dolphin.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
Until 2005, &quot;Orcaella brevirostris&quot; was the only recognized species in the genus &quot;Orcaella&quot;. However, comparisons within the populations of &quot;Orcaella&quot; inhabiting the Asia region and populations inhabiting the Australia/New Guinea region show distinctions in habitat, morphology, and genetics. Morphological differences include skull shape, presence or absence of a median dorsal groove in front of the dorsal fin, height of dorsal fin, and coloration. Genetic analysis constitutes a 5.9% difference between the two populations. In 2005, these significant distinctions considered by Beasley, Arnold and Robertson warranted a taxonomic split of the genus &quot;Orcaella&quot; into two separate species, &quot;Orcaella brevirostris&quot; and &quot;Orcaella heinsohni&quot;. &quot;Orcaella brevirostris&quot; known as the Irrawaddy dolphin consists of the Asian population. The newly recognized species, known as the Australian snubfin dolphin, consists of the Australian/New Guinea population.

The snubfin dolphins (&quot;Orcaella&quot;) contain two of the 35 species of oceanic dolphins that make up the Cetacean family of Delphinidae. The phylogenetic status of &quot;Orcaella&quot; has long been confused. Although the snubfin dolphins share similar external features with the Monodontidae (narwhal), a genetic study conducted by Arnason and Gretarsdottir identified the &#x27;Irrawaddy dolphin&#x27; as a delphinid. In their study, phylogenetic information obtained from a highly repetitive DNA (hrDNA) component characteristic of all cetaceans show that &quot;Orcaella&quot; share close relationships with the Delphinidae rather than the Monodontidae.

Some molecular analyses indicate that the genus &quot;Orcaella&quot; is closely related to the orca of the genus &quot;Orcinus&quot;, the two of them together forming the subfamily Orcininae. However, more recent studies have firmly found that &quot;Orcaella&quot; belongs in the Globicephalinae.

==Habitat==

Irrawaddy dolphins are mainly found in shallow and coastal waters in the Indo-West Pacific region. The Range of their presence stretches from the Bay of Bengal to the northeastern Australian Coast. One of their most common habitats are in the Mekong River of southern Laos, Ranging from the Khone Falls all the way to the Cambodian Border. Much of the data on the Irrawaddy dolphins of this region is collected by the Lao shore, where they are sighted daily during the dry season supposedly due to the importance of deep-water pools in the area. Their geographic range also extends to the coasts of Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia with some even being restricted to freshwater environments such as certain bodies of water in India and Thailand. They are known to stay relatively close to the shore, with most sightings being as close 1.6 kilometers off the shoreline and as far as 5 kilometers.

==Population==
In the western Gulf of Carpentaria in Australia, an estimate of one thousand specimens were calculated, though this number may be incorrect due to the lack of visibility when looking into the water and the unpredictable movement patterns of the dolphins. These dolphins form small groups of around ten, with information leading researchers to believe that they only occur in small, localized populations, rather than large groups that travel together. In spite of this, it is difficult to specifically designate a number for their population due to outstanding factors such as the large lack of data and human interference.

==Characteristics==

===Irrawaddy dolphin===
The Irrawaddy dolphin shares similar physical characteristics with the beluga whale, but its genetic makeup ties the Irrawaddy dolphin and the killer whale as close relatives of one another. Irrawaddy dolphins have a slate blue to a slate gray color and their bodies can grow up to 180-275 centimeters in length.

Irrawaddy dolphins eat fish and crustaceans and are rarely found by themselves. They are usually found in groups of around ten dolphins. These dolphins swim rather slowly while scouting for areas. They will raise their heads above the water and continue to swim around to familiarize themselves with their surroundings.

===Australian snubfin dolphin===
Australian snubfin dolphins are very similar to the Irrawaddy dolphins, however, while the bodies of Irrawaddy dolphins are two-colored, the bodies of Australian snubfins are three-colored. Australian snubfins can vary in color from a gray to a blue-gray. Their white underside, including the belly and genitals, helps in distinguishing them from the Irrawaddy dolphins. The Australian snubfins do not have a beak, but their necks, like the necks of Irrawaddy dolphins, are very flexible which leave creases or wrinkles behind their heads. Australian snubfins are shy and tend to stay away from boats. The skulls and fins of Australian snubfins also have slight variations from the Irrawaddy dolphins. Similar to the Irrawaddy, the Australian snubfins feed on fish and fish eggs, crustaceans, and cephalopods.

The bodies of the female Australian snubfin dolphins can grow up to 2.3m while the male bodies can grow up to 2.7m. Like the Irrawaddy dolphins, the Australian snubfins can weigh up to 130 kg.

Australian snubfins usually group together in schools of up to fifteen dolphins. Unlike the Irrawaddy dolphins, Australian snubfins can be found traveling alone. Usually the average school of Australian snubfins consists of five dolphins. These groups of Australian snubfins are found along Australia&#x27;s north coast from the Kimberley National Marine Park in Western Australia to the Gladstone region of Queensland and can be spotted in the waters of Papua New Guinea.

==Conservation==

===Irrawaddy dolphin===
In 2008, the IUCN Red List changed its assessment of the Irrawaddy dolphin (&quot;Orcaella brevirostris&quot;) from data deficient to vulnerable. Currently, five out of the seven sub-populations of Irrawaddy dolphin are categorized as critically endangered. The species was given the status due to the low sizes of sub-populations, significant range declines, and threats to the species continue to be documented, unsustainable and severe.

====Threats====
Irrawaddy dolphins inhabit freshwater environments making them subject to anthropogenic threats. They include mortality from bycatch (specifically gillnets); habitat degradation caused by: dams, deforestation, and mining; contact with vessels; and capture for live aquarium display. Irrawaddy dolphin have also been hunted in the past in certain areas including the Mekong and Mahakam Rivers. Other potential threats include noise pollution in nearby cities and the possibility of mass pathogen induced mortalities.

====Conservation====
The action plan for the Conservation of Irrawaddy dolphins provides detail on strategies to alleviate the bycatch problem and considers that protection of certain areas of freshwater Irrawaddy dolphin populations can be an effective method of conservation.

===Australian snubfin dolphin===
After the species of Australian snubfin dolphin (&quot;Orcaella heinsohni&quot;) was declared a new species in 2005, the species was categorized as near threatened on the IUCN Red List in 2008. Although data of population structure and population trends is limited, the species was categorized as near threatened rather than data deficient. This is due to species&#x27; small population size (fewer than 10,000 mature individuals), limited range, low densities, and the species&#x27; vulnerability to bycatch. After more conclusive data is collected, a reassessment of the species has the potential to be categorized as either vulnerable or endangered.

====Threats====
Due to its occurrence in the close proximity to the Australian/New Guinean shore, the Australian snubfin dolphin is threatened by anthropogenic causes. A significant number of Australian snubfin dolphins are killed by anti-shark nets used to protect bathers and inshore gill-nets embedded across creeks and rivers. However, compared to the Irrawaddy dolphin, the Australian snubfin dolphins have fewer cases of habitat degradation.

====Conservation actions====
Regulations have been set in order to mitigate bycatch, however net attendance rules and gear modifications are hardly enforced.

<text>An electronic portfolio (also known as a digital portfolio, online portfolio, e-portfolio, e-folio, or eFolio) is a collection of electronic evidence assembled and managed by a user, usually but not only on the Web (online portfolio).

Such electronic evidence may include input text, electronic files, images, multimedia, blog entries, and hyperlinks. E-portfolios are both demonstrations of the user&#x27;s abilities and platforms for self-expression. If they are online, users can maintain them dynamically over time.

One can regard an e-portfolio as a type of learning record that provides actual evidence of achievement. Learning records are closely related to the learning plan, an emerging tool which individuals, teams, communities of interest, and organizations use to manage learning. To the extent that a personal learning environment captures and displays a learning record, it may also operate as an electronic portfolio.

E-portfolios, like traditional portfolios, can facilitate students&#x27; reflection on their own learning, leading to more awareness of learning strategies and needs.

==Types==
There are three main types of e-portfolios, although they may be referred to using different terms:
*developmental (e.g., working)
*assessment
*showcase

A developmental e-portfolio can show the advancement of skill over a period of time rubrics. The main purpose is to provide an avenue for communication between student and instructor. An assessment portfolio will demonstrate skill and competence in a particular domain or area. A showcase portfolio highlights stellar work in a specific area, it is typically shown to potential employers to gain employment. When it is used for job application it is sometimes called career portfolio. Most e-portfolios are a mix of the three main types to create a hybrid portfolio.

==Usage==
Electronic portfolios have been used in:
* Schools (&quot;see also&quot; Technology integration)
* Higher education
* Continuing professional development
* Job applications/professional advertisements
* Therapy groups
* Assessment
* Accreditation 
* Recognition of prior learning (RPL)

===In education===
In education, the electronic portfolio is a collection of a students&#x27; work that can advance learning by providing a way for them to organize, archive, and display work. The electronic format allows a professor to evaluate student portfolios as an alternative to paper-based portfolios because they provide the opportunity to review, communicate, and give feedback in an asynchronous manner. In addition, students are able to reflect on their work, which makes the experience of creating the e-portfolio meaningful. A student e-portfolio may be shared with a prospective employer or used to record the achievement of program or course specific learning outcomes.

The uses of e-portfolios are most common in the courses with departments of education. Most preservice teachers are asked to compile an e-portfolio to demonstrate competencies needed to gain teaching certification or licensure. Student e-portfolios are increasingly being used in other disciplines such as communications, math, business, nursing, engineering and architecture. In education e-portfolios have six major functions:
* Document skills and learning;
* Record and track development within a program;
* Plan educational programs;
* Evaluate and monitor performance;
* Evaluate a course; 
* Find a job

In general e-portfolios promote critical thinking and support the development of technology literacy skills. Faculty now use e-portfolios to record course or discipline designs that may be shared with colleagues to promote teaching and learning. A teaching e-portfolio is used to showcase career accomplishments.
Different sorts of files can be added here which the marking and other work is easier for the student as well as tutor.

E-portfolios also help to foster an independent and autonomous way of thinking, according to Strivens. This is in large part because people must focus on their collective work, think about how it will be portrayed, and what the work says about them as an individual. The individual is then in charge of their learning and the choice of where to demonstrate their proficiency. People are also forced to reflect on what they have learned and how they plan to build and improve in the future. This helps people to become better critical thinkers and helps them to develop their writing and multimedia skills. Today, many students are using multimedia such as Facebook, Twitter, and texting—all informal settings. The electronic portfolio, on the other hand, is a more formal setting where students must apply both their knowledge of how the web works and the message they want to convey. In this sense, students&#x27; use and comfort with the web at times can be a hindrance if they are not taught to use electronic portfolios in the correct fashion, suggests Lane. Many universities and schools are currently working to make sure that students are gaining practice and experience with electronic portfolios so that they are able to use them to the best of their ability. For example, in places like Michigan students can earn the MCOATT (Michigan Certificate of Outstanding Achievement in Teaching Technology) for submitting an electronic portfolio which demonstrates evidence of technology being used in the classroom. This consortium is an organization aimed to make Michigan one of the leaders in integrating technology into the training of young professionals.

<text>Maria Isabella Boyd (May 9, 1844 – June 11, 1900), best known as Belle Boyd (and dubbed the Cleopatra of the Secession or Siren of the Shenandoah, and later the Confederate Mata Hari) was a Confederate spy in the American Civil War. She operated from her father&#x27;s hotel in Front Royal, Virginia, and provided valuable information to Confederate General Stonewall Jackson in 1862.

==Early life==
Maria Isabella &quot;Belle&quot; Boyd was born on May 9, 1844, in Martinsburg, Virginia (now part of West Virginia). She was the eldest child of Benjamin Reed and Mary Rebecca (Glenn) Boyd. She described her childhood as idyllic. After some preliminary schooling in Martinsburg, she attended finishing school at the Mount Washington Female College in Baltimore, Maryland in 1856 at age 12.

==Southern spy==

Boyd&#x27;s espionage career began by chance. According to her 1866 account, a band of Union army soldiers heard that she had Confederate flags in her room on July 4, 1861, and they came to investigate. They hung a Union flag outside her home. Then one of the men cursed at her mother, which enraged Boyd. She pulled out a pistol and shot the man, who died some hours later. A board of inquiry exonerated her of murder, but sentries were posted around the house and officers kept close track of her activities. She profited from this enforced familiarity, charming at least one of the officers whom she named in her memoir as Captain Daniel Keily, 

She wrote in her memoir that she was indebted to Keily &quot;for some very remarkable effusions, some withered flowers, and a great deal of important information.&quot; She conveyed those secrets to Confederate officers via her slave Eliza Hopewell, who carried them in a hollowed-out watch case. Boyd was caught on her first attempt at spying and told that she could be sentenced to death. 

General James Shields and his staff gathered in the parlor of the local hotel in mid-May 1862. Boyd hid in the closet in the room, eavesdropping through a knothole that she enlarged in the door. She learned that Shields had been ordered east from Front Royal, Virginia. That night, she rode through Union lines, using false papers to bluff her way past the sentries, and reported the news to Colonel Turner Ashby, who was scouting for the Confederates. She then returned to town. When the Confederates advanced on Front Royal on May 23, Boyd ran to greet Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s men, avoiding enemy fire that put bullet holes in her skirt, as according to her memoir. She urged an officer to inform Jackson that &quot;the Yankee force is very small [...] Tell him to charge right down and he will catch them all.&quot; 

Jackson did and wrote a note of gratitude to her: &quot;I thank you, for myself and for the army, for the immense service that you have rendered your country today.&quot; For her contributions, she was awarded the Southern Cross of Honor. Jackson also gave her captain and honorary aide-de-camp positions.

Boyd was arrested at least six times but somehow evaded incarceration. By late July 1862, detective Allan Pinkerton had assigned three men to work on her case. She was finally captured by Union officials on July 29, 1862, after her lover gave her up, and they brought her to the Old Capitol Prison in Washington, D.C. the next day. An inquiry was held on August 7, 1862, concerning violations of orders that Boyd be kept in close custody. She was held for a month before being released on August 29, 1862, when she was exchanged at Fort Monroe. She was arrested again in June 1863, but was released after contracting typhoid fever.

In March 1864, Boyd attempted to travel to England, but she was intercepted by a Union blockade and sent to Canada where she met Union naval officer Samuel Wylde Hardinge. The two married in England. and had a daughter, Grace. Boyd became an actress in England after her husband&#x27;s death to support her daughter. Following the death of her husband in 1866, she and her daughter returned to the United States. 

Boyd assumed the stage name Nina Benjamin to perform in several cities, eventually ending up in New Orleans where she married John Swainston Hammond in March 1869, a former British Army officer who fought for the Union Army during the Civil War. They had two sons and two daughters; their first son died as an infant. Boyd divorced Hammond in 1884 and married Nathaniel Rue High in 1885. She subsequently began touring the country giving dramatic lectures of her life as a Civil War spy.

==Postwar years and death==

Boyd published a highly fictionalized narrative of her war experiences in the two-volume &quot;Belle Boyd in Camp and Prison&quot;. She died of a heart attack in Kilbourn City, Wisconsin (Wisconsin Dells) on June 11, 1900, at age 56. She was buried in the Spring Grove Cemetery in Wisconsin Dells, with members of the Grand Army of the Republic as her pallbearers. For years, her grave simply read:

<doc id="374421" wikidata="Q1966867" url="?curid=374421" title="Russian tradition of the Knights Hospitaller">
<text>The Russian tradition of the [[Knights Hospitaller]] is a collection of charitable organisations claiming continuity with the Russian Orthodox grand priory of the Order of Saint John. 

The order emerged when Malta was captured by Napoleon in 1798 during the expedition to Egypt. The Grand Master at the stronghold of Malta, Ferdinand von Hompesch, failed to anticipate or prepare for the threat. The Order continued to exist in a diminished form and negotiated with European governments for a return to power. The Emperor of Russia gave shelter to the largest number of Knights in St Petersburg and this gave rise to the Russian tradition of the Knights Hospitaller and recognition within the Russian Imperial Orders. In gratitude the Knights declared Ferdinand von Hompesch deposed and Emperor Paul I was elected as the new Grand Master. The continuous Order was also approved by the Papacy, but due to British fear of Russians establishing a presence in the Mediterranean and because many knights were Orthodox Christians, the Order became de facto the traditional Order but de jure not recognised similarly or at par with the Sovereign Military Order of Malta or the Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg).

The organisations that claim to belong to the Russian tradition of the Knights Hospitaller are usually ecumenical, admitting baptized Christians from various Christian denominations.

==Origin==
Blessed Gerard created the Order of St John of Jerusalem as a distinctive Order from the previous Benedictine establishment of Hospitallers (Госпитальеры). It provided medical care and protection for pilgrims visiting Jerusalem. After the success of the First Crusade, it became an independent monastic order, and then as circumstances demanded grafted on a military identity, to become an Order of knighthood. The Grand Priory of the Order moved to Rhodes in 1312, where it ruled as a sovereign power, then to Malta in 1530 as a sovereign/vassal power.

==17th century==

In 1698, Peter the Great sent a delegation to Malta under Field Marshal Boris Sheremetev, to observe the training and abilities of the Knights of Malta and their fleet. Sheremetev also investigated the possibility of future joint ventures with the Knights, including action against the Turks and the possibility of a future Russian naval base.

Before leaving Malta, Ambassador Sheremetev, established diplomatic relations and was invested as a Knight of Devotion of the order.

==18th century==

The special relationship between the Knights of Malta and the crown of Russia continued into the 18th century.

From 1766 to 1769, Catherine the Great sent many distinguished Russian naval officers for special training with the Knights of Malta.

From 1770 to 1798 there was a continuing presence of the Russian Navy among the Knights of Malta.

From 1772 to 1773, Grand Master Pinto sent Baillif Sagramoso as an ambassador to Russia, with the aim of maintaining the Order&#x27;s cordial relationship with the northern giant.

In 1789, Bailiff Count Giulio Renato de Litta, while on an official visit from the Knights of Malta, assisted with the reorganization of Russia&#x27;s Baltic Fleet, and later served as a commander with the Russian Imperial Navy in the war against Sweden.

In 1782, Empress Catherine sent her son Grand Duke Paul to visit Grand Master De Rohan as a gesture of her respect and admiration. The next year, she sent Count Psaro as an envoy to visit De Rohan in Malta to solidify her relationship with the Knights of Malta, and further Russian influence in the Mediterranean.

In 1797, Paul I, Emperor of Russia signed a Treaty with the Order of Malta, establishing a Roman Catholic Grand Priory of 10 Commanderies in Russia in compensation for the loss of income from the former Polish Grand Priory (of 6 Commanderies), which lay in the Polish territory annexed by Russia.

In 1798, following Napoleon&#x27;s taking of Malta, the Order was dispersed, but with a large number of refugee Knights sheltering in St Petersburg, where they elected the Russian Emperor, Paul I as their Grand Master, replacing Ferdinand Hompesch then held in disgrace. Hompesch abdicated in 1799, under pressure from the Austrian Court, leaving Paul as the De facto Grand Master. Although Paul I was the leader of the Russian Orthodox Church, he assumed leadership of the order, which he structured as a Grand Priory with two divisions, a Catholic priory and an Ecumenical priory (for Lutherans and Orthodox Christians).

==19th century – October Revolution of 1917==

In 1802, the mission of the Corps des Pages (founded in 1759 as a school for training chamber pages) was broadened to that of a military academy, based on the ideals of the Order of St John. In 1810, the school was moved to the palace of the Sovereign Order of St John of Jerusalem. It continued at this location in St. Petersburg for over one hundred years (until the revolution).

There is disagreement about what happened next. Following Imperial Decrees of Alexander I of Russia in 1810–1811, the properties of Russian Grand Priory of Russia was nationalized, and the property basis of the until then hereditary commanderies became non-existent. Proponents of the view that a separate Russian order existed, see this as if a fiscal and legal separation of the Russian tradition of St John from the main Roman Catholic HQ was created (The main motive of these decrees was financial as Alexander sought to reduce his father&#x27;s lavish expenditures and build up a war chest for his struggle against Napoleon. As early as May 1802, Lord St. Helens (British Minister to the Court of Russia) informed the Hon. Arthur Paget (Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Court of Austria) that the Russian Emperor was going to make the Russian Priory &quot;an independent and separate Community&quot;, which would have stripped &quot;perhaps nine-tenths of the Revenues that constituted the Order’s principal income!&quot; Although the Emperor did not take this action in 1802, by 1810, necessity forced the independence. Proponents of the survival claim that a Russian Order came to exist from 1810 and was akin to the German Johanniter Order, a Johannine tradition, but legally separate.

Opponents of the interpretation of this as a creation of a separate Russian order have argued that Emperor Alexander I abolished the Russian Grand Priory and/or the Order based on Decree for 1810, not least due to taking away the substance of the commanderies. Proponents say in return that is a bad misreading, misleading even Russian authors such as V.A. Durov. The Decree of 1810 Ukase 24.134 – 26 February 1810, which removed the Order&#x27;s property, specifically states that the Order is still to continue, and that &quot;All the expenses connected with the maintenance and running of the Order should be paid from the State Treasury&quot; &quot;cited from the Ukase.&quot; Opponents argue that this reference is to the Order of Malta in Italy, which the emperor had recognized.

The Court Almanachs following that period still listed the Order of St John, listing as &quot;protecteur&quot; Alexandre Pavlovitch. In the 1813 Almanac the total membership of the Russian Grand Priory was 853, and the Catholic Grand Priory numbered 152. A further 21 members of the Order resided in Russia, providing in excess of a 1000 members.

However, there is no documentary evidence of any new members being admitted to any Russian order. There is also no evidence of any Russians fulfilling the requirements for membership of the order and succession to a commandery set out in the statutes issued by Emperor Paul. There is also no surviving evidence of any office holders of a Russian Grand Priory beyond 1810. Perhaps most tellingly there is no documentation that Emperor Alexander or his successors signed or styled themselves as protectors, grand masters or grand priors of any such institution.

A further decree was issued in 1817 forbidding Army Officers from wearing their decorations because they received them from outside of Russia from a foreign Bailiff of the Roman Catholic Order, which no longer officially existed in Russia by then. No such decree was ever issued concerning members of the &quot;non-Roman Catholic&quot; Russian Grand Priory, and in fact the reverse was true.

One of the leading French Bailiffs of the Military Order of Malta, who had studied the Russian tradition provided a footnote in his book; &quot;Nevertheless, the Tsars have exceptionally authorised the eldest sons of the descendants of hereditary commanders to wear the decorations. Such an authorisation can be cited in the military service records of 19 October 1867.(De Taube. p. 43) One can also find the name of Demidoff, in his quality as hereditary commander in the Almanach de Gotha (1885, p. 467 and 1923, p. 556) and in the Almanach de St Petersbourg, 1913/14 p. 178&quot; &quot; Pierredon, Count Marie Henri Thierry Michel de, Histoire Politique de l&#x27;Ordre Souverain de Saint-Jean de Jerusalem, (Ordre de Malte) de 1789 à 1955, Vol 2, page 197&quot;.

In the Division of Petitions of His Imperial Majesty&#x27;s Chancery, for 1912, Record No. 96803 permission is given to Count Alexander Vladimirovitch Armfeldt to wear the insignia of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, with the transfer of that right, after his death, to his son.

Portraits of Russian nobility wearing insignias of the Order of St John can be found throughout the 19th Century, with listings of members found in the Court Almanacs from the early 19th century through to the 20th Century.

It has been claimed that there is evidence of the Order&#x27;s existence in Russia throughout the 19th Century on into the 20th Century; however, this is only through secondary evidence in handbooks, etc., and not primary sources. Some of these works include:

==20th–21st centuries==
This Russian Hospitaller tradition of St John continued within the Russian Empire. Russian émigrés who went into exile following the Revolution in 1917 have attempted to keep the Order alive.

On 24 June 1928, a group of 12 Russian Hereditary Commanders met in Paris to re-establish the activities of the Russian Grand Priory. They were supported by three other Russian Nobles who were aspirants and admitted as Knights, and a Hereditary Commander of the Catholic Grand Priory of Russia. They came under the leadership of Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich to 1933, and Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich to 1956, both holding the title of &quot;Grand Prior&quot;. In 1939, Grand Duke Andrei and the Council agreed to the creation of a Priory in Denmark; the Priory of &quot;Dacia&quot;. On 9 December 1953, the Hereditary Commanders held a reunion in Paris and drew up a Constitution for the Russian Grand Priory in exile. In February 1955, the exiled Grand Priory based in Paris was registered as a Foreign Association under French Law as &quot;The Russian Grand Priory of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem.&quot;

Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia became the &quot;Protector&quot; to the Paris group in 1956, but refused the title of Grand Prior. Commander Nicholas Tchirikoff became the Dean of the Union until 1974. Prince Nikita Troubetzkoy became the remaining member of the council, which effectively signalled the end of the formal Paris group.

In 1958, a working title was adopted; &quot;Union des Descendants des Commandeurs Hereditaires et Chevaliers du Grand Prieure Russe de l&#x27;Ordre de St Jean de Jerusalem&quot;. Although by 1975, with the death of the secretary, the original leadership had died out and the jurisdiction of the Paris Group came to a definite legal end; it is asserted that the tradition has been maintained by the Priory of Dacia, (which was acknowledged as a legal part of the Union) together with a number of descendants of the Hereditary Commanders associated with the Russian Grand Priory Association. In 1977, however, Count Nicholas Bobrinsky, along with several of the Hereditary Commanders, also claimed to maintain this tradition and became what is now known as the Orthodox Order of the Knights of St. John, Russian Grand Priory. This international philanthropic and chivalric group in the Russian tradition is based in New York, and has over 600 members including descendants of hereditary Russian nobility including several of the original Hereditary Commander families, as well as descendants of the House of Romanov and other Royal Houses, and has recognition as an NGO/DPI by the United Nations.

Paul I had created under Russian law, the Family Commanders of the Russian Grand Priory with Hereditary Rights. It is the descendants of these Commanders who have, with the support of members of the Imperial family, continued that Russian tradition in exile. In the latter days of the Empire and into exile, these were known as &quot;Hereditary Commanders&quot;. The Commanders organised within the &quot;Russian Grand Priory&quot;, a corporate organisation which existed under various names; &quot;Association of Hereditary Commanders&quot; (1928), &quot;Russian Philanthropic Association of the descendants of the hereditary commanders of Sovereign the Order of Malta&quot; (1929–1932), &quot;Union des Commandeurs Hereditaires et Chevaliers du Grand Prieure Russe de l&#x27;Ordre de St Jean de Jerusalem&quot; (1957–1958) and the longer &quot;Union&quot; title given above (1958–1975). Today various groups claim to be the continuation of the Russian Priory.

In July 2014, Maria Vladimirovna, Grand Duchess of Russia, a dynast of the House of Romanov and a leading claimant to the Russian Throne, whose claims are disputed by some members of the Romanov family, issued a statement through her Chancellery, disavowing and denying that any chivalric orders, or noble or hereditary commanderies, associated with the Order of St John survived Alexander I&#x27;s decrees, citing the history of the Order of Malta in Russia, as well as Russian source documents.

==Self styled / mimic orders==

The history of the survival of this tradition has been complicated by various mimic orders. The large passage fees (alleged in some cases to be in the region of $50,000) collected by the American Association of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta in the early 1950s may well have tempted Charles Pichel to create his own &quot;Sovereign Order of St John of Jerusalem, Knights Hospitaller&quot; in 1956. Pichel avoided the problems of being an imitation of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta by giving his organization a mythical history, claiming that it was founded by Russian Hereditary Commanders living in, or visiting, the US and dated to 1908; a spurious claim, but which nevertheless misled many including some academics. In truth, the foundation of his organisation had no connection to the genuine Russian tradition of the Knights Hospitaller. Once created, the attraction of a few exiled Russian nobles into membership of Pichel&#x27;s &quot;Order&quot; lent some credence to his claims. This organisation and others have led to scores of other self-styled Orders. Two offshoots of the Pichel Order were successful in gaining the backing of two exiled monarchs, the late King Peter II of Yugoslavia, and King Michael of Romania.

<text>Revolting Cocks, also known as RevCo, are an American-Belgian industrial rock band, and sometimes supergroup, that began as a musical side project for Richard 23 of Front 242, Luc van Acker, and Al Jourgensen of Ministry.

==History==
=== 1984: Origins ===
Revolting Cocks&#x27; origins date to late 1984, when Belgian industrial dance group Front 242, after being invited by Chicago-based indie record label Wax Trax! Records, commenced their first American tour as an opening act for their then-labelmates, American band Ministry. Afterwards, Ministry lead singer Al Jourgensen asked Front 242 member Richard 23 to produce a dub remix project. After returning to Brussels, Richard 23 discussed collaboration with Luc van Acker; Van Acker, previously session guitarist for Shriekback, joined the newly formed project after talking with Jourgensen over the phone. The band&#x27;s name came from an incident that took place in a Chicago bar; according to van Acker and Jourgensen, the band was trying out &quot;insulting French expressions&quot; on a waiter, ordering something they said meant &quot;revolting cock&quot; which led the waiter to say, &quot;You are revolting cocks!&quot;

Their first release was &quot;No Devotion&quot; on Wax Trax! Records in 1985. The single was quickly followed by an album, &quot;Big Sexy Land&quot; (1986), featuring a mix of industrial, hard rock, and EBM with dominating sampling and strong synthesized beats.

=== 1985–1994: Initial run ===
Richard 23 quit in 1986, after falling out with Jourgensen over his and Adrian Sherwood&#x27;s remix of the song &quot;You Often Forget&quot;. The group&#x27;s remaining two members were augmented by Chris Connelly (formerly of Finitribe, later of Ministry), Paul Barker and Bill Rieflin (both formerly of The Blackouts and at the time in Ministry), with various others appearing as contributors or guests.

The following live album, &quot;Live! You Goddamned Son of a Bitch&quot; (1988), recorded at a single September 1987 show in Chicago, featured more aggressive versions of the &quot;Big Sexy Land&quot; tracks along with some new material. This trend continued on &quot;Beers, Steers, and Queers&quot; (1990), layering sample over sample and pushing ever further into distortion. The budget for &quot;Beers, Steers, and Queers&quot; and its accompanying single &quot;(Let&#x27;s Get) Physical&quot; ballooned to $30,000 in early 1990 primarily due to copyright troubles surrounding the cover of Olivia Newton-John&#x27;s hit song, and led to a strained relationship between Jourgensen and Wax Trax. As it happened, these would be the last Revolting Cocks releases on Wax Trax as Sire Records bought out the rights to all of Jourgensen&#x27;s side projects.

&quot;Linger Ficken&#x27; Good&quot; (1993) was released by Sire Records, with most tracks returning to the less layered material. Included was a cover of Rod Stewart&#x27;s &quot;Da Ya Think I&#x27;m Sexy?&quot;, also released as a single. A tour was planned but cancelled, and the band went on hiatus.

=== 2004–2010: First revival ===
In 2004, Jourgensen and former RevCo player Phildo Owens (Skatenigs, Snow Black) revived the group and previewed a new song, &quot;Prune Tang&quot;. An album titled &quot;Purple Head&quot; was due in 2004, but was delayed until 2006 with a change in title to &quot;Cocked and Loaded&quot;. &quot;Caliente (Dark Entries)&quot;, a cover of &quot;Dark Entries&quot; by Bauhaus, with vocalist Gibby Haynes (Butthole Surfers), was featured on the soundtrack to &quot;Saw II&quot; in 2005.

After assembling a touring line up to open for Ministry on the MasterBaTour of 2006, Jourgensen chose vocalist Josh Bradford (Stayte, Simple Shelter, V.H.S.), keyboardist Clayton Worbeck (Stayte, Simple Shelter), and guitarist Sin Quirin (Society 1, later Ministry and ReVamp) as the new full-time members for the Revolting Cocks, now simply being called &quot;RevCo&quot;. The group recorded &quot;Sex-O Olympic-O&quot;, which was originally set to be released in October 2008, but was delayed multiple times until it saw release on March 3, 2009. Following a tour, a second album with this lineup, &quot;¿Got Cock?&quot;, was released on April 13, 2010. The project fell apart once again with Bradford and Worbeck parting ways. Quirin continued to work with Jourgensen following Ministry&#x27;s revival in 2011.

=== 2010s: Second revival ===
In celebration of the record label, a &quot;Wax Trax! Records Retrospectacle: Year Anniversary&quot; concert series was held from April 15 to 17, 2011 at Metro Chicago in Chicago, Illinois. As a part of the lineup, Chris Connelly, Paul Barker, and Luc van Acker performed Revolting Cocks songs with Duane Buford, Dan Brill, Jamie Duffy and others. For their performance on the 17th, Richard 23 joined them on stage to sing &quot;No Devotion&quot;.

In 2016, Richard 23, van Acker, Barker, and Connelly performed under the shorter name The Cocks for a six-date tour to mark the 30th anniversary of &quot;Big Sexy Land&quot;, accompanied by Dan Brill and Jason Novak. A larger tour followed in 2017, with the band using the original Revolting Cocks name. The band played a series of gigs in Europe, including the WGT and Infest festivals, before returning to the US for a tour with Front Line Assembly.

On April 8, 2018, Jourgensen announced that another album was in the process of being recorded.

<text>The Dorr Rebellion (1841–1842) (also referred to as Dorr&#x27;s Rebellion, Dorr&#x27;s War or Dorr War) was an attempt by residents to force broader democracy in the state of Rhode Island. It was led by Thomas Wilson Dorr, who mobilized his followers to demand changes to the state&#x27;s electoral rules. The state was still using its 1663 colonial charter as a constitution, which required that voters own land as qualification to vote. The rebellion established a parallel government alongside the existing chartered government and wrote a new constitution for Rhode Island. It failed, but it forced the rewriting of the state constitution to expand eligibility to vote.

== Precursors and causes ==
Rhode Island&#x27;s colonial charter of 1663 stated that any male landowner could vote. Most of the residents in Rhode Island Colony were farmers and held land, and this qualification was more democratic than any of the other American colonies. By the 1840s, the state required landed property worth at least $134, or ownership of land generating annual rent of at least $7, in order to vote.

As urbanization increased, large numbers of people did not own any land and therefore did not meet the requirement to vote. By 1829, 60 percent of the state&#x27;s men were ineligible to vote. Many of these were recent Irish Catholic immigrants.

Reformers favoring universal male suffrage argued that an electorate made up of only 40 percent of the state&#x27;s men, based on a colonial charter signed by the British monarch, was un-republican and thus violated the United States Constitution&#x27;s Guarantee Clause, Art. IV: Sec. 4 (&quot;The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government&quot;).

Before the 1840s, several attempts were made to replace the colonial charter with a new state constitution that provided broader voting rights, but all failed. The state lacked a procedure to amend the Charter. The Rhode Island General Assembly had failed to reapportion the legislature based on demographic changes as the cities acquired much larger populations. By 1841, most states of the United States had removed property requirements and other restrictions on voting (see Jacksonian democracy). Rhode Island was the only state falling significantly short of universal white male suffrage.

== Rebellion ==

In 1841, suffrage supporters led by Dorr gave up on attempts to change the system from within. In October, they held a People&#x27;s Convention and drafted a new constitution, known as the People&#x27;s Constitution, which granted the vote to all white men with one year&#x27;s residence. Dorr had originally supported granting voting rights to blacks, but he changed his position in 1840 because of pressure from white immigrants who wanted to gain the vote first. At the same time, the state&#x27;s General Assembly formed a rival convention and drafted the Freemen&#x27;s Constitution, with some concessions to democratic demands.

Late in that year, the two constitutions were voted on, and the Freemen&#x27;s Constitution was defeated in the legislature, largely by Dorr supporters, while the People&#x27;s Convention version was overwhelmingly supported in a referendum in December. Much of the support for the People&#x27;s Convention constitution was from the newly eligible voters, but Dorr claimed that most of those eligible under the old constitution had also supported it, making it legal.

In early 1842, both groups organized elections of their own, leading in April to the selections of both Dorr and Samuel Ward King as Governor of Rhode Island. King showed no signs of introducing the new constitution; when matters came to a head, he declared martial law. On May 4, the state legislature requested the dispatch of federal troops to suppress the &quot;lawless assemblages&quot;. President John Tyler sent an observer, then decided not to send soldiers because &quot;the danger of domestic violence is hourly diminishing&quot;. Nevertheless, Tyler cited the U.S. Constitution and added:

If resistance is made to the execution of the laws of Rhode-Island, by such force as the civil peace shall be unable to overcome, it will be the duty of this Government to enforce the constitutional guarantee—a guarantee given and adopted mutually by all the original States.

Most of the state militiamen were Irishmen newly enfranchised by the Dorr referendum, and they supported him. The Irish who played a growing role in Democratic politics in other states, such as Tammany Hall in New York City, gave Dorr their verbal support, but sent no money or men to help.

The &quot;Dorrites&quot; led an unsuccessful attack against the arsenal in Providence, Rhode Island on May 19, 1842. Defenders of the arsenal on the &quot;Charterite&quot; side (those who supported the original charter) included Dorr&#x27;s father Sullivan Dorr and his uncle Crawford Allen. At the time, these men owned the Bernon Mill Village in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. In addition, among the defenders of Providence were many black men who had supported Dorr before he dropped them from his call for suffrage. Dorr&#x27;s cannon failed to fire, no one was hurt, and his army retreated in disarray.

After his defeat, Dorr fled to New York and returned in late June 1842 with armed supporters. He assembled his forces on Acote&#x27;s Hill in Chepachet, where they hoped to reconvene the People&#x27;s Convention. Governor King called out the state militia which marched on Chepachet to engage the Dorrite forces. Charterite forces were sent to Woonsocket to defend the village and to cut off the Dorrite forces&#x27; retreat. The Charterites fortified a house in preparation for an attack, but it never came.

Dorr disbanded his forces, realizing that he would be defeated in battle by the approaching militia, and fled the state. Governor King issued a warrant for his arrest with a reward of $5,000.

== Aftermath ==
The Charterites were finally convinced of the strength of the suffrage cause and called another convention. In September 1842, a session of the Rhode Island General Assembly met at Newport, Rhode Island and framed a new state constitution, which was ratified by the old, limited electorate, was proclaimed by Governor King on January 23, 1843, and took effect in May. The new constitution greatly liberalized voting requirements by extending suffrage to any native born adult male, regardless of race, who could pay a poll tax of $1, which would go to support public schools in the state. The constitution retained the property requirement for non-native born citizens and prohibited members of the Narragansett Indian Tribe from voting.

In the next Presidential election held after the Dorr Rebellion in 1844, 12,296 votes were cast, a significant increase from the 8,621 cast in 1840.

In &quot;Luther v. Borden&quot; (1849), the Supreme Court of the United States held that the constitutional right to change governments was unquestioned, but that the Supreme Court did not have the authority to interfere because the Constitutional guarantee of a &quot;republican form of government&quot; was a political question best left to the other branches of the federal government.

== Dorr&#x27;s fate ==
Dorr returned in 1843, was found guilty of treason against the state, and was sentenced in 1844 to solitary confinement and hard labor for life. The harshness of the sentence was widely condemned, and Dorr was released in 1845, his health now broken. His civil rights were restored in 1851. In 1854, the court judgment against him was set aside. He died later that year.

==Interpretations==
Historians have long debated the meaning and nature of the rebellion.

Mowry (1901) portrayed the Dorrites as irresponsible idealists who ignored the state&#x27;s need for stability and order. Gettleman (1973) hailed it as an early working-class attempt to overthrow an elitist government. Dennison (1976) saw it as a legitimate expression of Republicanism in the United States, but concluded that politics changed little for Rhode Islanders after 1842 because the same elite groups ruled the state.

However, in 1854, the Rhode Island Supreme Court wrote: &quot;The union of all the powers of government in the same hands is but the definition of despotism&quot;. Thus, the same Court that convicted Dorr of treason against the charter in 1844 ruled ten years later that the charter had improperly authorized a despotic, non-republican, un-American form of government. Coleman (1963) explored the complex coalition that supported Dorr, with the changing economic structure of the state in mind, noting that the middle classes, the poor farmers, and the industrialists mostly peeled off after the 1843 Constitution gave in to their demands. The factory workers remained but were too few and too poorly organized to do much. He finds Seth Luther to be one of the few stalwarts from the working class.

The timidity of the Dorrites in 1842, Coleman concludes, was a reflection of their fragile coalition. Looking at Dorr himself, Coleman (1976) argued: &quot;At several crucial moments the suffragists were offered, but rejected, every reform they asked for. Indeed, the constitution they were offered even went beyond their demands. But Dorr would have no part of it; the process of formulation was flawed. It did not conform to his concept of popular sovereignty. Compromise was out of the question. Principle became all. Dorr hungered for the vindication of principle. He was determined to lead his supporters into martyrdom.&quot;

Henry Bowen Anthony wrote a poetical satire of the events, which was published without attribution in Boston by Justin Jones in 1842. It was republished in 1870, again without attribution to Anthony, along with another work concerning the events entitled &quot;The Dorriad, and The Great Slocum Dinner&quot;, by Sidney S. Rider &amp; Brother, Providence.

<text>Blankety Blank is a British comedy game show which first aired in 1979. The show is based on the American game show &quot;Match Game&quot;, with contestants trying to match answers given by celebrity panellists to fill-in-the-blank questions.

The original series ran from 18 January 1979 to 12 March 1990 on BBC1, hosted first by Terry Wogan from 1979 until 1983, then by Les Dawson from 1984 until 1990. A revival hosted by Paul O&#x27;Grady (under his drag alter-ego Lily Savage) was produced by Pearson Television&#x27;s UK subsidiary Fremantle (UK) Productions for BBC One from 26 December 1997 to 28 December 1999, followed with ITV from 7 January 2001 to 10 August 2002 as Lily Savage&#x27;s Blankety Blank.

David Walliams hosted a one-off Christmas Special for ITV on 24 December 2016, with Bradley Walsh hosting a 2020 Christmas Special of the show for the BBC, which in turn led to a second revival series that premiered on 2 October 2021.

==Format==
===Main game===
Two contestants compete, each attempting to match as many of the six celebrity panellists as possible in a series of fill-in-the-blank statements.

The main game is played in two rounds. The contestant with initial control in each round is given a blind choice of two statements, &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot;, and the host reads the chosen one aloud, with one word missing that is indicated by the word &quot;blank&quot;. Statements are frequently written with comedic, double entendre answers in mind. A classic example: &quot;Did you catch a glimpse of that girl on the corner? She has the world&#x27;s biggest &quot;blank&quot;.

While the contestant thinks of an answer, the celebrities write their responses on cards, without conferring. Once all six have done so, usually indicated by the celebrities lighting up their name card, the contestant states their answer. The host then asks the celebrities to reveal theirs, one at a time. The contestant scores one point for each celebrity whose answer is either an exact match or reasonably close, as determined by a panel of off-screen judges. The opposing contestant then takes a turn with the unused statement.

Initial control of the first round is determined by coin toss, while the trailing contestant after the first round starts the second. Only the celebrities that a contestant fails to match in the first round participate on that turn in the second, so there is only ever a maximum of six points possible. This also increases the chance of a tie-break. If a contestant makes all six matches in the first round, they sit out for the second and the opponent is given one chance to tie the score. Should the trailing contestant fail to at least tie the score, the game ends immediately without the leader having to take a turn.

The high scorer after two rounds wins the game and advances to the Supermatch. Ties are broken with one final question in which both contestants write down their responses and the celebrities then give their answers, one at a time. The first contestant to raise their matching answer wins; if the tiebreaker ends with no winner, a new question is played.

The &quot;A&quot;/&quot;B&quot; choice was eliminated when Les Dawson became the host, and reinstated once Lily Savage succeeded him.

===Supermatch===
The contestant is presented with a fill-in-the-blank phrase and must attempt to choose the most common response based on a studio audience survey. They may ask any three celebrities for help, then use one of those responses or offer one of their own. The contestant earns 150, 100 or 50 Blanks for matching the first, second, or third most popular answers, respectively. Failing to match any of these answers ends the round immediately.

A second main game is then played with two new contestants, and the winner plays the Supermatch as above. The winner who scores higher in the Supermatch becomes the day&#x27;s champion; any ties are broken as in the main game. The champion then chooses one celebrity to match against on a short phrase, and an exact match doubles the number of Blanks earned in the Supermatch. Regardless of the outcome, the champion receives a prize whose value depends on the final total of Blanks. Each episode offers a star prize for 300 Blanks, requiring a contestant to match the most popular answer in their own Supermatch and win the head-to-head final.

On &quot;Lily Savage&#x27;s Blankety Blank&quot;, the contestant with the highest Supermatch score or winner of a tiebreaker played the head-to-head round for an additional prize. In the current revival, both players play the tiebreaker even without a tie.

===Supermatch prizes===
Prizes on British game shows prior to 1990 were poor by modern standards. The Independent Broadcasting Authority restricted the value of prizes on ITV shows, and BBC-programme prizes were also of a modest value. Channels regulated by the Independent Broadcasting Authority were limited to the giving away prizes with the maximum value usually being £1,750. The poor-quality prizes on &quot;Blankety Blank&quot; became a running joke throughout the show&#x27;s various runs, particularly during the Dawson era. Dawson drew attention to the fact that the prizes were less-than-mediocre, not pretending that the show had &quot;fabulous prizes&quot; as others did, but making a joke of it, such as referring to them as &quot;fire salvaged&quot; prizes.

The consolation prize was the &quot;Blankety Blank&quot; chequebook and pen, which Dawson would often call &quot;The &quot;Blankety Blank&quot; chequepen and book!&quot;
In 1993, the IBA prize limits had been lifted, and the star prize on the 1990s revival was generally a holiday.

In the 2021 series, the Supermatch prizes consist of £500, £750, and prize worth over £750.

==Revivals and special editions==
&quot;Blankety Blank&quot; returned to British screens in November 2004 as a one-off edition as part of the BBC&#x27;s annual &quot;Children in Need &quot; telethon, in which Terry Wogan reprised his role as the host of the show, accompanied by his wand microphone.

In 2006, the show was released as an interactive DVD game, featuring Wogan.

Another one-off edition was shown on 21 April 2007 as part of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot; hosted by Vernon Kay.

A one-off edition of the programme was recorded in aid of Comic Relief&#x27;s &quot;24 Hour Panel People&quot;, on 6 March 2011. The recording was broadcast live on the Red Nose Day website and, in an edited version, on BBC Three on 14 March. Paul O&#x27;Grady returned as host, this time as himself.

On 22 August 2016, it was announced that David Walliams would front a Christmas special on ITV. The episode aired on Christmas Eve from 6.30–7.30pm and had seven panellists instead of the usual six, with the Chuckle Brothers playing together at one position.

On 14 December 2020, it was announced that Bradley Walsh would host a Christmas special on BBC One and the episode aired on Christmas Day from 7.00-7.40pm. At 5.26 million viewers, it was the third most watched Christmas Day programme in the overnight ratings. This special was so successful that the BBC announced on 30 April 2021 that it had been commissioned for a full series to air on Saturday nights later in the year on BBC One. A further series of 10 episodes (including a Christmas special) had been commissioned for transmission in 2022.

<doc id="374448" wikidata="Q837455" url="?curid=374448" title="Automatic test pattern generation">
<text>ATPG (acronym for both automatic test pattern generation and automatic test pattern generator) is an electronic design automation method or technology used to find an input (or test) sequence that, when applied to a digital circuit, enables automatic test equipment to distinguish between the correct circuit behavior and the faulty circuit behavior caused by defects. The generated patterns are used to test semiconductor devices after manufacture, or to assist with determining the cause of failure (failure analysis). The effectiveness of ATPG is measured by the number of modeled defects, or fault models, detectable and by the number of generated patterns. These metrics generally indicate test quality (higher with more fault detections) and test application time (higher with more patterns). ATPG efficiency is another important consideration that is influenced by the fault model under consideration, the type of circuit under test (full scan, synchronous sequential, or asynchronous sequential), the level of abstraction used to represent the circuit under test (gate, register-transfer, switch), and the required test quality.

== Basics ==
A defect is an error caused in a device during the manufacturing process. A fault model is a mathematical description of how a defect alters design behavior. The logic values observed at the device&#x27;s primary outputs, while applying a test pattern to some device under test (DUT), are called the output of that test pattern. The output of a test pattern, when testing a fault-free device that works exactly as designed, is called the expected output of that test pattern. A fault is said to be &quot;detected&quot; by a test pattern if the output of that test pattern, when testing a device that has only that one fault, is different than the expected output. The ATPG process for a targeted fault consists of two phases: &quot;fault activation&quot; and &quot;fault propagation&quot;. Fault activation establishes a signal value at the fault model site that is opposite of the value produced by the fault model. Fault propagation moves the resulting signal value, or fault effect, forward by sensitizing a path from the fault site to a primary output.

ATPG can fail to find a test for a particular fault in at least two cases. First, the fault may be intrinsically undetectable, such that no patterns exist that can detect that particular fault. The classic example of this is a redundant circuit, designed such that no single fault causes the output to change. In such a circuit, any single fault will be inherently undetectable.

Second, it is possible that a detection pattern exists, but the algorithm cannot find one. Since the ATPG problem is NP-complete (by reduction from the Boolean satisfiability problem) there will be cases where patterns exist, but ATPG gives up as it will take too long to find them (assuming P≠NP, of course).

== Fault models ==
* single fault assumption: only one fault occur in a circuit. if we define &quot;k&quot; possible fault types in our fault model the circuit has &quot;n&quot; signal lines, by single fault assumption, the total number of single faults is &quot;k×n&quot;.
* multiple fault assumption: multiple faults may occur in a circuit.

=== Fault collapsing ===
Equivalent faults produce the same faulty behavior for all input patterns. Any single fault from the set of equivalent faults can represent the whole set. In this case, much less than &quot;k×n&quot; fault tests are required for a circuit with &quot;n&quot; signal line. Removing equivalent faults from entire set of faults is called fault collapsing.

==== The stuck-at fault model ====

In the past several decades, the most popular fault model used in practice is the single stuck-at fault model. In this model, one of the signal lines in a circuit is assumed to be stuck at a fixed logic value, regardless of what inputs are supplied to the circuit. Hence, if a circuit has &quot;n&quot; signal lines, there are potentially &quot;2n&quot; stuck-at faults defined on the circuit, of which some can be viewed as being equivalent to others. The stuck-at fault model is a &quot;logical&quot; fault model because no delay information is associated with the fault definition. It is also called a &quot;permanent&quot; fault model because the faulty effect is assumed to be permanent, in contrast to &quot;intermittent&quot; faults which occur (seemingly) at random and &quot;transient&quot; faults which occur sporadically, perhaps depending on operating conditions (e.g. temperature, power supply voltage) or on the data values (high or low voltage states) on surrounding signal lines. The single stuck-at fault model is &quot;structural&quot; because it is defined based on a structural gate-level circuit model.

A pattern set with 100% stuck-at fault coverage consists of tests to detect every possible stuck-at fault in a circuit. 100% stuck-at fault coverage does not necessarily guarantee high quality, since faults of many other kinds often occur (e.g. bridging faults, opens faults, delay faults).

==== Transistor faults ====
This model is used to describe faults for CMOS logic gates. At transistor level, a transistor maybe stuck-short or stuck-open. In stuck-short, a transistor behaves as it is always conducts (or stuck-on), and stuck-open is when a transistor never conducts current (or stuck-off). Stuck-short will produce a short between VDD and VSS.

==== Bridging faults ====

A short circuit between two signal lines is called bridging faults. Bridging to VDD or Vss is equivalent to stuck at fault model. Traditionally both signals after bridging were modeled with logic AND or OR of both signals. If one driver dominates the other driver in a bridging situation, the dominant driver forces the logic to the other one, in such case a dominant bridging fault is used. To better reflect the reality of CMOS VLSI devices, a Dominant AND or Dominant OR bridging fault model is used. In the latter case, dominant driver keeps its value, while the other one gets the AND or OR value of its own and the dominant driver.

==== Opens faults ====

==== Delay faults ====
Delay faults can be classified as:
* Gate delay fault
* Transition fault
* Hold Time fault
* Slow/Small delay fault
* Path delay fault: This fault is due to the sum of all gate propagation delays along a single path. This fault shows that the delay of one or more paths exceeds the clock period. One major problem in finding delay faults is the number of possible paths in a circuit under test (CUT), which in the worst case can grow exponentially with the number of lines &quot;n&quot; in the circuit.

== Combinational ATPG ==
The combinational ATPG method allows testing the individual nodes (or flip-flops) of the logic circuit without being concerned with the operation of the overall circuit. During test, a so-called scan-mode is enabled forcing all flip-flops (FFs) to be connected in a simplified fashion, effectively bypassing their interconnections as intended during normal operation. This allows using a relatively simple vector matrix to quickly test all the comprising FFs, as well as to trace failures to specific FFs.

== Sequential ATPG ==
Sequential-circuit ATPG searches for a sequence of test vectors to detect a particular fault through the space of all possible test vector sequences. Various search strategies and heuristics have been devised to find a shorter sequence, or to find a sequence faster. However, according to reported results, no single strategy or heuristic out-performs others for all applications or circuits. This observation implies that a test generator should include a comprehensive set of heuristics.

Even a simple stuck-at fault requires a sequence of vectors for detection in a sequential circuit. Also, due to the presence of memory elements, the controllability and observability of the internal signals in a sequential circuit are in general much more difficult than those in a combinational logic circuit. These factors make the complexity of sequential ATPG much higher than that of combinational ATPG, where a scan-chain (i.e. switchable, for-test-only signal chain) is added to allow simple access to the individual nodes.

Due to the high complexity of the sequential ATPG, it remains a challenging task for large, highly sequential circuits that do not incorporate any Design For Testability (DFT) scheme. However, these test generators, combined with low-overhead DFT techniques such as partial scan, have shown a certain degree of success in testing large designs. For designs that are sensitive to area or performance overhead, the solution of using sequential-circuit ATPG and partial scan offers an attractive alternative to the popular full-scan solution, which is based on combinational-circuit ATPG.

== Nanometer technologies ==
Historically, ATPG has focused on a set of faults derived from a gate-level fault model. As design trends move toward nanometer technology, new manufacture testing problems are emerging. During design validation, engineers can no longer ignore the effects of crosstalk and power supply noise on reliability and performance. Current fault modeling and vector-generation techniques are giving way to new models and techniques that consider timing information during test generation, that are scalable to larger designs, and that can capture extreme design conditions. For nanometer technology, many current design validation problems are becoming manufacturing test problems as well, so new fault-modeling and ATPG techniques will be needed.

== Algorithmic methods ==
Testing very-large-scale integrated circuits with a high fault coverage is a difficult task because of complexity.
Therefore, many different ATPG methods have been developed to address combinational and sequential circuits.

* Early test generation algorithms such as boolean difference and literal proposition were not practical to implement on a computer.
* The D Algorithm was the first practical test generation algorithm in terms of memory requirements. The D Algorithm [proposed by Roth 1966] introduced D Notation which continues to be used in most ATPG algorithms. D Algorithm tries to propagate the stuck at fault value denoted by D (for SA0) or (for SA1) to a primary output. 
* Path-Oriented Decision Making (PODEM) is an improvement over the D Algorithm. PODEM was created in 1981, by Prabhu Goel, when shortcomings in D Algorithm became evident when design innovations resulted in circuits that D Algorithm could not realize.
* Fan-Out Oriented (FAN algorithm) is an improvement over PODEM. It limits the ATPG search space to reduce computation time and accelerates backtracing.
*Methods based on Boolean satisfiability are sometimes used to generate test vectors.
*Pseudorandom test generation is the simplest method of creating tests. It uses a pseudorandom number generator to generate test vectors, and relies on logic simulation to compute good machine results, and fault simulation to calculate the fault coverage of the generated vectors.
* Wavelet Automatic Spectral Pattern Generator (WASP) is an improvement over spectral algorithms for sequential ATPG. It uses wavelet heuristics to search space to reduce computation time and accelerate the compactor. It was put forward by Suresh kumar Devanathan from Rake Software and Michael Bushnell, Rutgers University. Suresh kumar Devanathan invented WASP as a part of his thesis at Rutgers.

== Relevant conferences ==
ATPG is a topic that is covered by several conferences throughout the year. The primary US conferences are the International Test Conference and The VLSI Test Symposium, while in Europe the topic is covered by DATE and ETS.

<text>Connie Stevens (born Concetta Rosalie Ann Ingoglia; August 8, 1938) is an American actress and singer. Born in Brooklyn to musician parents, Stevens was raised there until the age of 12, when she was sent to live with family friends in rural Missouri. In 1953, when she was 15 years old, Stevens relocated with her father to Los Angeles.

She began her career in 1957, making her feature film debut in &quot;Young and Dangerous&quot;, before releasing her debut album, &quot;Concetta&quot;, the following year. She had a supporting role in the musical comedy &quot;Rock-A-Bye Baby&quot; (1958) opposite Jerry Lewis, followed by the drama film &quot;The Party Crashers&quot; (also 1958) opposite Frances Farmer.

Stevens gained widespread recognition for her portrayal of &quot;Cricket&quot; Blake on the ABC TV Warner Brothers series &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot;, beginning in 1959 opposite Robert Conrad and Anthony Eisley. She garnered concurrent musical success when her single &quot;Sixteen Reasons&quot; became a national radio hit, peaking at number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and the UK Singles Chart in 1960. Stevens continued to appear in film and television throughout the 1970s and 1980s, as well as performing as a musical nightclub act.

Stevens&#x27; later film roles include in the comedy &quot;Tapeheads&quot; (1988) and the drama &quot;Love Is All There Is&quot; (1996). In 2009, Stevens made her directorial debut with the feature film &quot;Saving Grace B. Jones&quot;, which she also wrote and produced, based partly on elements of her own childhood.

==Early life==
Stevens was born Concetta Rosalie Ann Ingoglia in Brooklyn, New York, United States, the daughter of musician Peter Ingoglia (known as Teddy Stevens) and singer Eleanor McGinley. Stevens is of Italian and Irish descent. She adopted her father&#x27;s stage name of Stevens as her own. Her parents divorced and she lived with her grandparents and attended Catholic boarding schools. Actor John Megna was her maternal half-brother. 

At the age of 12, she witnessed a murder while waiting at a bus stop in Brooklyn in 1950-51. The event traumatized Stevens, and she was sent to live with family friends in Boonville, Missouri.

Coming from a musical family, Stevens joined the singing group called The Fourmost with Tony Butala, who went on to fame as founder of The Lettermen. Stevens moved to Los Angeles with her father in 1953.

==Career==

===Early films===
Her first notable film role was in &quot;Young and Dangerous&quot; (1957) with Mark Damon, a low budget teen movie. She also was in &quot;Eighteen and Anxious&quot; (1957); and an episode of &quot;The Bob Cummings Show&quot; (&quot;Bob Goes Hillbilly&quot;). In December 1957 Stevens signed a seven-year contract with Paramount starting at $600 a week going up to $1,500 a week.

Jerry Lewis saw her in &quot;Dragstrip Riot&quot; (1958), and cast her as his love interest in his 1958 production of &quot;Rock-A-Bye Baby&quot;, giving Stevens her first big break.

Stevens made another film with Damon, &quot;The Party Crashers&quot; (1958), before Paramount dropped her.

===Warner Bros. and &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot;===

In May 1959, she signed a seven-year contract with Warner Bros. starting at $300 per week. Like many Warners contract players, Stevens was kept busy guest-starring on their regular TV shows such as &quot;The Ann Sothern Show&quot;, &quot;Maverick&quot;, &quot;Tenderfoot&quot;, &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; and &quot;Cheyenne&quot;.

She appeared opposite James Garner in an episode of the TV Western series &quot;Maverick&quot; titled &quot;Two Tickets to Ten Strike,&quot; which also featured Adam West. Stardom came when she was cast as Cricket Blake in the popular television detective series &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; from 1959 to 1963, a role that made her famous; her principal costar was Robert Conrad.

First televised on December 23, 1960, she appeared (uncredited) in &quot;The Dresden Doll&quot;, Episode 15 of Season 3 of &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot; as her character from &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot;, Cricket Blake.

In a televised interview on August 26, 2003, on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, Stevens recounted that while on the set of &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; she was told she had a telephone call from Elvis Presley. &quot;She didn&#x27;t believe it, but in fact it was Elvis, who invited her to a party and said that he would come to her house and pick her up personally&quot;; they subsequently dated.

===Music career===
Stevens&#x27; first album was titled &quot;Concetta&quot; (1958). She had minor single hits with the standards &quot;Blame It on My Youth&quot; (music by Oscar Levant and lyrics by Edward Heyman), &quot;Looking for a Boy&quot; (music by George Gershwin and lyrics by Ira Gershwin), and &quot;Spring Is Here&quot; (music by Richard Rodgers and lyrics by Lorenz Hart).

After making several appearances on the Warner Bros. hit TV series &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, she recorded the hit novelty song &quot;Kookie, Kookie (Lend Me Your Comb)&quot; (1959), a duet with one of the stars of the program, Edd Byrnes, that reached #4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. She and Byrnes also appeared together on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom&quot;.

She had hit singles as a solo artist with &quot;Sixteen Reasons&quot; (1960), her biggest hit, reaching #3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, (#9 in the UK) and a minor #71 hit &quot;Too Young to Go Steady&quot; (1960) (music by Jimmy McHugh and lyrics by Harold Adamson). Other single releases were &quot;Apollo&quot;,&quot;Why&#x27;d You Wanna Make Me Cry?&quot;, &quot;Something Beautiful,&quot; &quot;Mr. Songwriter,&quot; &quot;Now That You&#x27;ve Gone,&quot; &quot;La-La (Means I Love You)&quot; (originally performed by The Delfonics), and &quot;Keep Growing Strong&quot; (which was remade by the Stylistics under the title &quot;Betcha by Golly, Wow&quot;).

===Film stardom and theatre===
Stevens&#x27; popularity on the small screen and as a recording star encouraged Warner Bros. to try her in films. She starred in three films for the studio, all opposite Troy Donahue: &quot;Parrish&quot; (1961), as a rural girl; &quot;Susan Slade&quot; (1962), playing the title role, an unwed mother; and &quot;Palm Springs Weekend&quot; (1963), a teen romantic comedy. In 1962 Warner Bros. suspended her briefly for refusing to go on a publicity tour. She performed in &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; on stage in Kansas.

When &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot; ended, Stevens guest-starred on &quot;Temple Houston&quot; and &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;. She played the lead in the horror film &quot;Two on a Guillotine&quot; (1965), for Warners.

Stevens later starred as Wendy Conway in the television sitcom &quot;Wendy and Me&quot; (1964–1965) with George Burns, who also produced the show with Warner Bros. and played an older man who watched Wendy&#x27;s exploits upstairs on what appears to be a surreptitious closed-circuit television hook-up in his apartment. She had a percentage of the show, and had three and a half years left on her contract with Warners. She said &quot;I&#x27;ve done the teenage epics... and want to move up into something like &quot;Virginia Woolf&quot; or &quot;Any Wednesday&quot;. I want to be a big star but do I have to throw tantrums and behave badly to get there? Can&#x27;t I just be talented and work hard and be happily married?&quot;

Stevens had the juvenile lead in &quot;Never Too Late&quot; (1965), released by Warner Bros. She signed a new contract with Warner Bros. to make one film a year for six years.

She reprised her stage performance of &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; at Carousel Theatre, California, then followed it with &quot;Any Wednesday&quot;, at Melodyland, Anaheim California. Stevens was reunited with Jerry Lewis in &quot;Way... Way Out&quot; (1966).

===Broadway and nightclubs===
Stevens in 1966 starred in the Broadway production of Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Star-Spangled Girl&quot; with Anthony Perkins and Richard Benjamin. While she continued to appear in television series such as &quot;ABC Stage 67&quot;, &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, and &quot;Love, American Style&quot;, Stevens enjoyed performing live, so in 1968 she also began appearing regularly in nightclubs in Las Vegas, where her shows were well received by both audiences and entertainment critics.

===TV movies===
Stevens had a small role in a TV movie &quot;The Littlest Angel&quot; (1969). She made &quot;Mister Jerico&quot; (1970) for British TV and had a supporting role in &quot;The Grissom Gang&quot; (1971).

Stevens starred in the TV movies &quot;Call Her Mom&quot; (1972), &quot;Playmates&quot; (1972), &quot;Every Man Needs One&quot; (1972), and &quot;The Sex Symbol&quot; (1974).

She turned down the Valerie Perrine role in &quot;Lenny&quot; because of its nudity.

She had the lead in a feature &quot;Scorchy&quot; (1976).

In the 1970s, Stevens started singing the &quot;Ace Is the Place&quot; jingle on Ace Hardware TV commercials in Southern California, and was a guest on &quot;The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast&quot; a few times.

In the spring of 1977, Stevens appeared in a first-season episode of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;.

===1980s===
She was in &quot;Love&#x27;s Savage Fury&quot; (1979), &quot;Murder Can Hurt You!&quot; (1980), &quot;Scruples&quot; (1980), &quot;Aloha Paradise&quot;, &quot;Side Show&quot; (1981), &quot;Harry&#x27;s Battles&quot; (1981), and &quot;Grease 2&quot; (1982).

Stevens guest starred on &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;Detective in the House&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; and &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot;.

She had supporting roles in &quot;Rowdies&quot; (1986), &quot;Back to the Beach&quot; (1987), &quot;Tapeheads&quot; (1988), and &quot;Bring Me the Head of Dobie Gillis&quot; (1988).

She also was seen numerous times on the Bob Hope USO specials, including his Christmas Show from the Persian Gulf (1988).

In 1988, Stevens said &quot;I still want to make movies with Marlon Brando. But first I&#x27;ve got to get hot. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying to do - get hot. I&#x27;m still waiting for the big role. I haven&#x27;t peaked yet.&quot;

She elaborated:
I&#x27;m a big star all over the world except in Hollywood. I play (nightclubs in) Japan and Hong Kong every Christmas and New Year&#x27;s... I don&#x27;t have a hit TV show, I don&#x27;t have a hit record, I don&#x27;t have a hit movie, but I created something that people still love. I invented Cricket. There was barely a part written for me. Half the time, I said whatever I wanted. I was everybody&#x27;s daughter. I was every boy&#x27;s fantasy girlfriend. Girls wanted to be like me. That good feeling still exists. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m a big business, with 17 people working for me. I may not be the richest woman in the world, but I do okay. But Hollywood is a different story... There&#x27;s something wrong when an actress can come off a &#x27;Dynasty&#x27; or a &#x27;Falcon Crest&#x27; and get a production deal (to star in a mini-series or TV movie) and I can&#x27;t.
Stevens had a regular role on the sitcom &quot;Starting from Scratch&quot; (1988). She said at the time, &quot;TV is not my favorite medium; the work is hard, you don&#x27;t have any life, and I feel like I&#x27;ve already been a champion in it, but the economics of the business is you need momentum to get hot. I&#x27;m using this to get me into movies.&quot; The show only lasted one season.

===1990s onwards===
Stevens’ later appearances include &quot;Ellen&quot;, &quot;Love Is All There Is&quot;, &quot;Baywatch&quot;, &quot;Clueless&quot;, &quot;James Dean: Race with Destiny&quot; (1997), &quot;Returning Mickey Stern&quot;, &quot;Titus&quot;, &quot;Wild Card&quot;, &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot;, &quot;Fat Actress&quot;, &quot;The Wedding Album&quot;.

In 1997, Stevens wrote, edited, and directed a documentary entitled &quot;A Healing&quot;, about Red Cross nurses who served during the Vietnam War. The following year it won the title of Best Film at the Santa Clarita International Film Festival. She also co-wrote and directed the thriller &quot;Saving Grace B. Jones&quot; (2009); it was shot in Boonville and is based on true events that Stevens witnessed there, as a child.

She also was in &quot;Double Duty&quot; (2009), &quot;Just Before I Go&quot; (2014), and &quot;Search Engines&quot; (2016), co-starring daughter Joely Fisher.

==Other projects==

In 1969, Stevens toured with the Bob Hope USO tour to Guam and Southeast Asia.

In 1987, she, Barbara Eden and Lee Greenwood toured with Bob Hope on his USO tour to the Persian Gulf. Among her charitable works, she founded the Windfeather project to award scholarships to Native Americans, and supports CancerGroup.com. In 1991 Stevens received the Lady of Humanities Award from Shriners Hospital and the Humanitarian of the Year Award by the Sons of Italy in Washington, D.C.

Stevens developed her own cosmetic skin care product line, Forever Spring, and in the 1990s opened the Connie Stevens Garden Sanctuary Day Spa in Los Angeles.

In 1994, accompanied by her two daughters, she issued her first recording in several years, &quot;Tradition: A Family at Christmas,&quot;

She made nightclub appearances and headlined in major Las Vegas showrooms.

==Awards and recognition==
Stevens has a star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars in Palm Springs, California, a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6249 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California, and a star on the Italian Walk of Fame in Toronto, Ontario.

On September 23, 2005, Stevens was elected secretary-treasurer of the Screen Actors Guild, the union&#x27;s second-highest elected position. She succeeded James Cromwell, who did not seek re-election.

On June 29, 2013, the National Society of Daughters of the American Revolution&#x27;s President General, Merry Ann Wright, presented Stevens with the Founder&#x27;s Medal for Patriotism for her 40+ years of work with the USO.

==Personal life==
Stevens dated actor Glenn Ford in the early 1960s.

She was married twice during her twenties. Her first husband, from 1963 until their 1966 divorce, was actor James Stacy. Her second husband, from 1967 until they divorced in 1969, was singer Eddie Fisher. She is the mother of actresses Joely Fisher and Tricia Leigh Fisher, and the former stepmother of Todd Fisher and actress Carrie Fisher. Stevens is a half-sister of John Megna through their mother.

<text>Fyshwick () is a retail and light industrial suburb of Canberra, Australia, east of the South Canberra district. At the , Fyshwick had a population of 56.

It has many motor vehicle dealers, stores selling home furnishings and hardware, and stores that sell goods wholesale. Fyshwick also has the Canberra Outlet Centre and the Fyshwick Fresh Food Markets. There are also some cafés and fast-food outlets.

It was named after Sir Philip Fysh, a Tasmanian politician who assisted in bringing about Australia&#x27;s Federation. The suffix &quot;wick&quot;, from Old English, means &quot;dwelling place&quot;and, by extension, &quot;village&quot; or &quot;district&quot;. Its streets are named after Australia&#x27;s industrial towns and regionsfor example, Mount Isa is represented by Isa Street and Townsville is represented by Townsville Street.

Fyshwick is also known for its adult entertainment industry. Fyshwick and Mitchell are the two places in the ACT where strip clubs and brothels may operate legally. Prostitution in the ACT was decriminalised in 1992, but strip clubs and brothels are restricted to those two suburbs. Fyshwick was also known for firework retailers before their 2009 ban from public purchase in the Australian Capital Territory.

The only railway line into Canberra runs through the middle of Fyshwick, dividing the area into halves. Ipswich and Newcastle Streets as well as the Monaro Highway cross the railway line, uniting both halves of Fyshwick.

The Fyshwick sewage treatment works was built in 1967 to treat waste water that could not easily be pumped to the other side of Canberra. It is now used to treat industrial waste water, which is then used to water the Duntroon grounds and golf course.
==History==
One noteworthy portion of Fyshwick, located between the railway line and Canberra Avenue, was built as an internment camp during early 1918. It was known as the Molonglo Internment Camp, although it was also referred to as a concentration camp. The site was intended to accommodate 3,500 German and Austrian nationals being expelled from China, however once the camp had been established in May 1918 these internees were no longer destined for Molonglo. Instead, the camp housed 150 internees transferred from the Bourke Camp in New South Wales. The camp was closed in late 1919 after the internees were deported to Germany. Most of the camp&#x27;s buildings were sold off, with the remaining buildings being converted to house construction workers, some of whom were unemployed returned servicemen. It was then called Molonglo Settlement. Gradually the camp buildings were moved to other camp sites around Canberra and the roads used to service the camp became the first streets of Fyshwick.
The internment camp&#x27;s hospital at what is now Tennant Street became the Molonglo Public School. This school closed in 1942 and then became a naval auxiliary wireless station. This operated until 1946. The station consisted of one wooden T-shaped building and a fibro mess hall. This station operated the receivers for the strategic fixed radio links to Australia for Whitehall, Halifax and Bombay Fort. During this period 14 WRANS operated the equipment. Marion Stevens was a Petty Officer in charge of the station from 1943 to 1946. She was notable as the only woman in charge of a transmitting station.

The station was part of the Harman radio network, as was connected via a landline to the main Harman site. Equipment at the Molonglo station included teleprinters for use when reception was good. During poorer radio propagation periods morse code radiotelegraphy had to be used.

After the war the Molonglo station became a dog training school. In the early 1980s the buildings were demolished.

==Geology==
Most of the north of Fyshwick is underlain by Canberra Formation, calcareous shale.
On top of this to the east and west of Jerrabomberra creek are Tertiary pebble gravels, and also quaternary alluvium.
There are two andesite dykes intruded across Gladstone Street.

South of the South Fyshwick fault is the dacitic andesite of the Ainslie Volcanics.

The South Fyshwick Fault starts in Narrabundah, runs east from Lithgow St to Tennant Street, crosses the Molonglo river and heads north east to Dundee Hill to join Sullivans Fault.

==Education==
Fyshwick residents get preference for:
*A shared Priority Enrollment Area (PEA) of Forrest Primary and Red Hill Primary
*Telopea Park School (for high school)
*Narrabundah College

<doc id="374481" wikidata="Q116243" url="?curid=374481" title="Quota method">
<text>The quota or divide-and-rank methods make up a category of apportionment rules, i.e. algorithms for allocating seats in a legislative body among multiple groups (e.g. parties or federal states). The quota methods begin by calculating an entitlement (basic number of seats) for each party, by dividing their vote totals by an electoral quota (a fixed number of votes needed to win a seat, as a unit). Then, leftover seats, if any are allocated by rounding up the apportionment for some parties. These rules are typically contrasted with the more popular highest averages methods (also called divisor methods).

By far the most common quota method are the largest remainders or quota-shift methods, which assign any leftover seats to the &quot;plurality&quot; winners (the parties with the largest remainders, i.e. most leftover votes). 

When using the Hare quota, this rule is called [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamilton]]&#x27;s method, and is the third-most common apportionment rule worldwide (after Jefferson&#x27;s method and Webster&#x27;s method).

Despite their intuitive definition, quota methods are generally disfavored by social choice theorists as a result of apportionment paradoxes. In particular, the largest remainder methods exhibit the no-show paradox, i.e. voting &quot;for&quot; a party can cause it to &quot;lose&quot; seats. The largest remainders methods are also vulnerable to spoiler effects and can fail resource or house monotonicity, which says that increasing the number of seats in a legislature should not cause a party to lose a seat (a situation known as an Alabama paradox).

==Method==
The largest remainder method divides each party&#x27;s vote total by a &quot;quota&quot;. Usually, quota is derived by dividing the number of valid votes cast, by the number of seats. The result for each party will consist of an integer part plus a fractional remainder. Each party is first allocated a number of seats equal to their integer. This will generally leave some remainder seats unallocated. To apportion these seats, the parties are then ranked on the basis of their fractional remainders, and the parties with the largest remainders are each allocated one additional seat until all seats have been allocated. This gives the method its name - largest remainder.

Largest remainder methods produces similar results to single transferable vote or the quota Borda system, where voters organize themselves into solid coalitions. The single transferable vote or the quota Borda systembehave like the largest-remainders method when voters all behave like strict partisans (i.e. only mark preferences for candidates of one party).

==Quotas==

There are several possible choices for the electoral quota. The choice of quota affects the properties of the corresponding largest remainder method, and particularly the seat bias. Smaller quotas allow small parties to pick up seats, while larger quotas leave behind more votes. A somewhat counterintuitive result of this is that a &quot;larger&quot; quota will always be more favorable to &quot;smaller&quot; parties. A party hoping to win multiple seats sees fewer votes captured by a single popular candidate when the quota is small.

The two most common quotas are the Hare quota and the Droop quota. The use of a particular quota with one of the largest remainder methods is often abbreviated as &quot;LR-[quota name]&quot;, such as &quot;LR-Droop&quot;.

The Hare (or simple) quota is defined as follows:

: formula_1

LR-Hare is sometimes called Hamilton&#x27;s method, named after Alexander Hamilton, who devised the method in 1792.

The Droop quota is given by:

: formula_2

and is applied to elections in South Africa.

The Hare quota is more generous to less-popular parties and the Droop quota to more-popular parties. Specifically, the Hare quota is &quot;unbiased&quot; in the number of seats it hands out, and so is more proportional than the Droop quota (which tends to give more seats to larger parties). The Hare suffers the disproportionality that it sometimes allocates a majority of seats to a party with less than a majority of votes in a district.

==Examples==
The following example allocates 10 seats using the largest-remainder method by Droop quota.
== Pros and cons ==
It is easy for a voter to understand how the largest remainder method allocates seats. Moreover, the largest remainder method satisfies the quota rule (each party&#x27;s seats are equal to its ideal share of seats, either rounded up or rounded down) and was designed to satisfy that criterion. However, this comes at the cost of greater inequalities in the seats-to-votes ratio, which can violate the principle of one man, one vote.

However, a greater concern for social choice theorists, and the primary cause behind its abandonment in many countries, is the tendency of such rules to produce erratic or irrational behaviors called apportionment paradoxes:

* &quot;Increasing&quot; the number of seats in a legislature can &quot;decrease&quot; a party&#x27;s apportionment of seats, called the Alabama paradox.
* Adding more parties to the legislature can cause a bizarre kind of spoiler effect called the new state paradox.
** When Congress first admitted Oklahoma to the Union, the House was expanded by 5 seats, equal to Oklahoma&#x27;s apportionment, to ensure it would not affect the seats for any existing states. However, when the full apportionment was recalculated, the House was stunned to learn Oklahoma&#x27;s entry had caused New York to lose a seat to Maine, despite there being no change in either state&#x27;s population.
** By the same token, apportionments may depend on the precise order in which the apportionment is calculated. For example, identifying winning independents first and electing them, then apportioning the remaining seats, will produce a different result from treating each independent as if they were their own party and then computing a single overall apportionment.

Such paradoxes also have the additional drawback of making it difficult or impossible to generalize procedure to more complex apportionment problems such as biproportional apportionments or partial vote linkage. This is in part responsible for the extreme complexity of administering elections by quota-based rules like the single transferable vote (see counting single transferable votes).

=== Alabama paradox ===
The Alabama paradox is when an &quot;increase&quot; in the total number of seats leads to a &quot;decrease&quot; in the number of seats allocated to a certain party. In the example below, when the number of seats to be allocated is increased from 25 to 26, parties D and E end up with fewer seats, despite their entitlements increasing.

With 25 seats, the results are:

With 26 seats, the results are:

<doc id="374483" wikidata="Q1076951" url="?curid=374483" title="Chris Argyris">
<text>Chris Argyris (July 16, 1923 – November 16, 2013) was an American business theorist and professor at Yale School of Management and Harvard Business School. Argyris, like Richard Beckhard, Edgar Schein and Warren Bennis, is known as a co-founder of organization development, and known for seminal work on learning organizations.

== Biography ==
Argyris was born a twin—along with Thomas S. Argyris (1923–2001)—into a family of Greek immigrants to the United States in Newark, New Jersey. Argyris (pronounced AHR-JUR-ris) grew up in Irvington, New Jersey, and Athens, Greece. In World War II he served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. After his service he studied psychology at Clark University, where he met Kurt Lewin. He obtained his MA in 1947, and joined the University of Kansas, where he obtained his MSc in Psychology and Economics in 1949. In 1951 received his PhD from Cornell University, with a thesis under the supervision of William F. Whyte on organizational behavior.

In 1951 Argyris started his academic career at Yale University as part of the Yale Labor and Management Center where he worked under its director and an early influence, E. Wight Bakke. At Yale he subsequently became appointed Professor of Management science. In 1971 he moved to Harvard University, where he was Professor of Education and Organizational Behavior, until his retirement. Argyris was active as director of the consulting firm Monitor in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Argyris received an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Toronto in 2006 and a Doctor of Science award from Yale University in 2011.

Argyris died on November 16, 2013, age 90, and is buried at Linwood Cemetery in Weston, Massachusetts.

== Work ==

Argyris&#x27; early research explored the impact of formal organizational structures, control systems and management on individuals and how they responded and adapted to them. This research resulted in the books &quot;Personality and Organization&quot; (1957) and &quot;Integrating the Individual and the Organization&quot; (1964). He then shifted his focus to organizational change, in particular exploring the behaviour of senior executives in organizations, in &quot;Interpersonal Competence and Organizational Effectiveness&quot; (1962) and &quot;Organization and Innovation&quot; (1965).

From there he moved on to an inquiry into the role of the social scientist as both researcher and actor (&quot;Intervention Theory and Method&quot; (1970); &quot;Inner Contradictions of Rigorous Research&quot; (1980) and &quot;Action Science&quot; (1985) – with Robert Putnam and Diana McLain Smith). His fourth major area of research and theorizing – in significant part undertaken with Donald Schön – was in individual and organizational learning and the extent to which human reasoning, not just behavior, can become the basis for diagnosis and action (&quot;Theory in Practice&quot; (1974); &quot;Organizational Learning&quot; (1978); &quot;Organizational Learning II&quot; (1996) – all with Donald Schön). He has also developed this thinking in &quot;Overcoming Organizational Defenses&quot; (1990) and &quot;Knowledge for Action&quot; (1993).

=== Adult personality ===
Argyris believed that managers who treat people positively and as responsible adults will achieve productivity. Mature workers want additional responsibilities, variety of tasks, and the ability to participate in decisions. He also came to the conclusion that problems with employees are the result of mature personalities managed using outdated practices.

=== Action science ===
Argyris&#x27; collaborative work with Robert W. Putnam, (not to be confused with Robert D. Putnam), and Diana McLain Smith advocates an approach to research that focuses on generating knowledge that is useful in solving practical problems. Other key concepts developed by Argyris include ladder of inference, double-loop learning , theory of action/espoused theory/theory-in-use, high advocacy/high inquiry dialogue and actionable knowledge and the study of adult personality.

Argyris&#x27; concept of Action Science begins with the study of how human beings design their actions in difficult situations. Human actions are designed to achieve intended consequences and governed by a set of environment variables. How those governing variables are treated in designing actions are the key differences between single-loop learning and double-loop learning. When actions are designed to achieve the intended consequences and to suppress conflict about the governing variables, a single-loop learning cycle usually ensues. On the other hand, when actions are taken, not only to achieve the intended consequences, but also to openly inquire about conflict and to possibly transform the governing variables, both single-loop and double-loop learning cycles usually ensue. (Argyris applies single-loop and double-loop learning concepts not only to personal behaviors but also to organizational behaviors in his models.)

Model 1 illustrates how single-loop learning affects human actions. Model 2 describes how double-loop learning affects human actions. The following Model 1 and Model 2 tables introduce these ideas (tables are from Argyris, Putnam &amp; Smith, 1985, Action Science, Ch. 3). Other key books conveying Argyris&#x27; approach include Argyris &amp; Schon, 1974 and Argyris, 1970, 1980, 1994).

<doc id="374485" wikidata="Q5724524" url="?curid=374485" title="Henry Kučera">
<text>Henry Kučera (15 February 1925 – 20 February 2010), born Jindřich Kučera (), was a Czech-American linguist who pioneered corpus linguistics, linguistic software, a major contributor to the &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot;, and a pioneer in the development of spell checking computer software. He is remembered in particular as one of the initiators of the Brown Corpus.

==Early life and education==
Kučera was born in Třebařov (between Pardubice and Olomouc) in Czechoslovakia and later moved with his family to Hodonín, where he studied. When the Communists came to power in February 1948, his studies in philosophy and linguistics at Charles University in the Czech capital of Prague were interrupted. He was forced to leave Czechoslovakia in April 1948 when it became clear that his political writings had placed him at risk of detention by the Communist authorities.

Kučera then moved to Allied-occupied Germany where he worked under the supervision of the U.S. CIC (Counterintelligence Corps) for refugee organizations, assisting Czech refugees with relocation programs and preparing passports. It was during this time that he met Pavel Tigrid, who went on to become Kučera&#x27;s mentor and longtime friend. Following the Velvet Revolution in 1989, Tigrid went on to become the Minister of Culture for Czechoslovakia.

==Teaching career==
In 1949, he traveled to New York City aboard the . After receiving his PhD from Harvard University, he taught at the University of Florida at Gainesville for two years. Kučera then returned to Harvard as a research fellow. In 1955 he received an appointment at Brown University, where he was promoted to full professor in 1965. He spent the rest of his teaching career there. He retired in 1990 as the Fred M. Seed Professor Emeritus of Linguistics and Cognitive Sciences with, among other honors, a black tie retirement party and the publication of a Festschrift about his accomplishments.

==Works==
While at Brown, he was able to further pursue his interest in linguistics. There he became interested in the computational analysis of human language, though at the time there were scarcely any tools for this type of research.

In 1963 and 1964, Kučera collaborated with W. Nelson Francis to create the &quot;Brown Corpus of Standard American English&quot;, generally known as the &quot;Brown Corpus&quot;. This was a carefully compiled selection of current American English as published during the year 1961 in 1,000 sources on a wide variety of subjects. It has been very widely used in computational linguistics, and was for many years among the most-cited resources in the field. Kučera and Francis themselves subjected it to a variety of computational analyses from which derived their classic work &quot;Computational Analysis of Present-Day American English&quot; (1967), followed by Francis and Kučera&#x27;s &quot;Frequency Analysis of English Usage: Lexicon and Grammar&quot; (1982).

Shortly thereafter, Boston publisher Houghton-Mifflin approached Kučera to supply a million word, three-line citation base for its new &quot;American Heritage Dictionary&quot;. This ground-breaking new dictionary, which first appeared in 1969, was the first dictionary to be compiled using corpus linguistics for word frequency and other information.

Kučera wrote one of the first spell checkers over Christmas break, 1981, in PL/I, at the behest of Digital Equipment Corporation. It was a simple, rapid spelling verifier. Further development resulted in &quot;International Correct Spell&quot;, a spell checking program which was used on word processing systems such as WordStar and Microsoft Word as well as numerous small computer applications. Kučera later oversaw the development of Houghton-Mifflin&#x27;s Correct Text grammar checker, which also drew heavily on statistical techniques for analysis. He founded Language Systems Incorporated (LSI), later Language Systems Software Incorporated (LSSI), to manage his software programs and updates until the patents expired in 2002. Houghton-Mifflin spun out Inso Corporation . With income largely from Microsoft and others licensing the spelling and grammar tools, in 1996 Inso acquired Electronic Book Technologies.

==Honors==
In addition to his PhD in Linguistics from Harvard University, Kučera had a doctorate from Charles University in Prague which was restored after the Velvet Revolution ousted the communist rule in Czechoslovakia in 1989. He received honorary degrees from Pembroke College in Providence, RI, Bucknell University in Lewisburg, PA, and Masaryk University in Brno, Czech Republic (1990). Kučera was a member of the academic honor society Phi Beta Kappa.

<text>April Wine is a Canadian rock band formed in 1969 and based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, led by singer-guitarist-songwriter Myles Goodwyn until his death in 2023. April Wine first experienced success with their second album, &quot;On Record&quot; (1972), which reached the top 40 in Canada and yielded two hit singles: a cover of Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Bad Side of the Moon&quot;, a top 20 hit in Canada; and a cover of Hot Chocolate&#x27;s &quot;You Could Have Been a Lady&quot;, a number 2 song in Canada.

They have experienced only moderate international success, but great popularity in their home country of Canada. Their greatest response internationally throughout the 1970s and early &#x27;80s came with songs such as, &quot;You Could Have Been a Lady&quot; (1972), &quot;Tonite Is a Wonderful Time to Fall in Love&quot; (1975), &quot;Roller&quot; (1979), &quot;I Like to Rock&quot; (1980), &quot;Sign of the Gypsy Queen&quot; (1981), and &quot;Just Between You and Me&quot; (1981). They have released 16 studio albums.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
Although April Wine officially began in late 1969 in Waverley, Nova Scotia, their roots can be traced to St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, in 1967/68, where brothers David and Ritchie Henman grew up playing music together before moving to Nova Scotia.

Three of the founding members - David Henman (guitar), Ritchie Henman (drums), and their cousin Jim Henman (bass) - were originally in a band named Prism (not to be confused with the Vancouver-based band of the same name). After a brief break to attend university, the trio reformed with Myles Goodwyn on lead vocals and guitar. Goodwyn had previously played with Jim Henman in a group called the Termites. David Henman christened the new group &quot;April Wine&quot;. They realized that Halifax did not provide opportunities to play and record, so they sent a demo tape to Aquarius Records in Montreal. Aquarius managers Terry Flood and Donald K. Tarlton returned a rejection letter but the band mistook it for an invitation. On April 1, 1970, April Wine went to Montreal, bringing with them their instruments and $100 in cash; Flood and Tarlton were persuaded to sign the band to a contract. They were set up in a chalet and booked at a local comedy club, Café André. They spent the next five months touring eastern Canada with Mashmakhan.

The band recorded and released their self-titled debut album &quot;April Wine&quot; in September 1971. The album included a single, &quot;Fast Train&quot;, which was a top 40 hit in Canada and peaked at #38 on the RPM Singles Chart. It established Myles Goodwyn as April Wine&#x27;s main songwriter. The album did not sell well, but the success of the single led the band&#x27;s label to ask for a second album. Jim Henman left the band in the fall of 1971 and was replaced by Jim Clench. In the meantime, the band spent 1971 touring the college circuit, with the exception of July 30th, when they opened at Montreal&#x27;s Place Des Nations for The Guess Who. 1972 was much the same, although they began to play larger venues and opened for a few more large acts, like Ike &amp; Tina Turner, Jethro Tull, Badfinger and Stevie Wonder.

=== Mainstream success ===
Under the guidance of producer Ralph Murphy, April Wine recorded their second album, &quot;On Record&quot; in 1972. The first single was a cover version of the Hot Chocolate song &quot;You Could Have Been a Lady&quot;. The record was a commercial success, hitting number two for a single week on the RPM Canadian charts, as well as cracking the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in the United States where it stayed for 11 weeks, peaking at No. 32. A second single, a cover of &quot;Bad Side of the Moon&quot; by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, also got much airplay on Canadian radio and was a minor hit in the U.S. Both tracks remain staples on classic rock radio stations in Canada. &quot;On Record&quot; was certified Gold in Canada and the band, along with Murphy, returned to the studio.

While the band was recording their third album in 1973, David and Ritchie Henman quit. Goodwyn and Clench held auditions and the replacements were drummer Jerry Mercer (formerly of Mashmakhan) and guitarist Gary Moffet. They finished the album, &quot;Electric Jewels&quot;, with the songs &quot;Weeping Widow,&quot; &quot;Just Like That&quot; and &quot;Lady Run, Lady Hide&quot;, which would stay in April Wine&#x27;s set lists for many years. In support of this album, the band embarked on the Electric Adventure Tour where nearly every Canadian arena or concert hall that seated more than 2500 saw the band play. The tour also featured a massive lighting and pyrotechnic show. Touring proved successful; Gene Cornish and Dino Danelli of The Rascals attended a 1974 concert in Massey Hall, and were so impressed they offered to record and produce a live album of the band. The one-night recording session was something of a rushed enterprise; they wanted the album to be released by the end of the tour. Goodwyn wasn&#x27;t happy with the sound, but &quot;April Wine Live&quot; went gold.

=== Gold and platinum years ===
The band&#x27;s fifth release, 1975&#x27;s &quot;Stand Back&quot;, went double platinum in Canada, riding on the success of the singles &quot;Tonight Is A Wonderful Time To Fall In Love&quot; and &quot;I Wouldn&#x27;t Want To Lose Your Love&quot;. April Wine went on tour with Heart, then Thundermug. In April 1976, April Wine became the first band to sell out Regina Stadium and the first band to sell out Edmonton&#x27;s Kinsmen Field House two nights in a row. Following the tour, Jim Clench left, eventually to join Bachman–Turner Overdrive (in 1977); he was replaced by Steve Lang.

The band&#x27;s next release, in 1976, was &quot;The Whole World&#x27;s Goin&#x27; Crazy&quot;. It was the first April Wine release to hit platinum status based on advanced sales orders alone. The album contained the popular title track as well as a hit single, the ballad &quot;Like A Lover, Like A Song&quot;. Their sixth album, &quot;Forever for Now&quot;, was another platinum seller and contained the band&#x27;s biggest single to date, &quot;You Won&#x27;t Dance With Me&quot;.

On March 4 &amp; 5, 1977, April Wine was booked to play a charity concert at Toronto&#x27;s famed El Mocambo Club. The co-headliner on the bill was a band called &quot;The Cockroaches&quot;, which turned out to be The Rolling Stones. The pseudonym was a poorly kept secret and huge crowds turned out for the event. April Wine&#x27;s performance was captured and released as the album &quot;Live at the El Mocambo&quot;. The band then got its first chance at touring the U.S., opening for The Rolling Stones, Styx and Rush.

Also in 1977, Brian Greenway, late of The Dudes (the Henmans&#x27; new band) was brought in as a third guitarist and co-vocalist. His addition gave April Wine a powerful three guitar attack that would make their hard rock sound. This also allowed Goodwyn to switch to keyboards for ballads. They also signed to Capitol Records (in addition to Aquarius).

1978 saw continued Canadian success, and the beginning of international success. The band&#x27;s seventh album, and the first with Capitol, was &quot;First Glance&quot;, which had an immediate impact and the singles &quot;Let Yourself Go&quot; and &quot;Get Ready For Love&quot; were successful on Canadian radio. It was the third single, the raucous &quot;Roller&quot;, that brought the band mass appeal across North America—it stayed on the Billboard Hot 100 for eleven weeks. &quot;First Glance&quot; stayed on the Billboard album chart for many weeks, making it April Wine&#x27;s first gold record outside of Canada. Constant touring helped propel the band to greater success, as Americans embraced the hard rock of this &quot;new&quot; band from Canada—in 1978, they toured with Rush and played with Triumph, Starcastle, and Teaze and, in July, played a concert with the Rolling Stones, Journey, and the Atlanta Rhythm Section.

Following on the popularity of &quot;First Glance&quot;, April Wine released &quot;Harder ... Faster&quot; in 1979. &quot;Say Hello&quot; and &quot;I Like to Rock&quot; were popular hits on both sides of the border and &quot;Harder ... Faster&quot; proved to be yet another multi-platinum release for the band. It would stay on the Billboard top album chart for 40 weeks. 1979 was spent touring with Styx, Rush, Toto, Boston, Squeeze and Blue Öyster Cult. By now, the band had accumulated enough hits that Aquarius was able to release the album &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. In 1979, the BBC released &quot;In Concert&quot; for international distribution; in 1981, Aquarius released another compilation album, &quot;The Best of April Wine Rock Ballads&quot;.

=== 1980s ===

On 16th August 1980 the band performed at the inaugural Monsters of Rock festival in Castle Donington, England.

&quot;The Nature of the Beast&quot; was released in January 1981, and riding on the popularity of the hit singles &quot;Just Between You and Me&quot; and the band&#x27;s cover of the Lorence Hud song &quot;Sign of the Gypsy Queen&quot;, the album hit multi-platinum success in Canada, and was the first April Wine album to reach platinum status internationally. April Wine embarked on an extensive support tour, performing to their largest crowds ever. In addition to a packed schedule of solo concerts, they toured with Diamond Head, Harlequin, Krokus and Franke and the Knockouts, played five concerts with Loverboy, and travelled to Germany to play a concert with Neil Young, Jethro Tull, the Michael Schenker Group (MSG), and King Crimson. The band then went on an eighteen-month hiatus.

In July 1982 April Wine released their tenth studio album, &quot;Power Play&quot;. The album included the singles &quot;Enough is Enough&quot;, &quot;If You See Kay&quot; and &quot;Anything You Want, You Got It&quot;. The latter would become the band&#x27;s opening number on the supporting tour, while the &quot;Enough is Enough&quot; video started receiving frequent rotation on MTV. Despite decent sales, &quot;Power Play&quot; was not met with the same critical acclaim the prior two albums had received; both the album and its singles charted well on Billboard&#x27;s lists, but for shorter periods of time than earlier albums and singles. Still, it was certified gold, and then platinum, in October. The &quot;Power Play&quot; tour in 1982 was the band&#x27;s most extensive—three months, with Saga, Eddie Money and Uriah Heep. The New York concerts with Saga and Money resulted in separate &quot;Live From Central Park&quot; albums.

The band started writing and recording their next album, &quot;Animal Grace&quot;, but the members were not getting along, and Myles Goodwyn moved from Canada to the Bahamas. Both &quot;Animal Grace&quot; and its single &quot;This Could be the Right One&quot; rose quickly on the charts, but stayed only for a short time. In 1984 the band got together for its announced &quot;Farewell Tour&quot;, which was a month-long tour across Canada.
The tour was successful enough to spawn another live album, &quot;One for the Road&quot;.

April Wine still owed Capitol Records one more album. So Greenway joined Goodwyn in Nassau, along with Montreal session musicians Daniel Barbe (keyboards), Jean Pellerin (bass) and drummer Marty Simon, to record what was supposed to be the band&#x27;s final album, &quot;Walking Through Fire&quot;. It was released in September 1985 under the April Wine name.
=== Rebirth ===

In 1988 Goodwyn moved back to Canada. Although there was interest in an April Wine reunion, and the subject was discussed among the former members, other commitments prevented them from getting together until 1992. April Wine returned to the stage that year, starting with a free concert in Portage la Prairie, Manitoba. The reunited band consisted of Goodwyn, Greenway, returning drummer Jerry Mercer and bassist Jim Clench, who hadn&#x27;t played with the band since 1975. Filling out the act was third guitarist Steve Segal. The band toured in both Canada and the US. In 1993, now with Flood Ross Entertainment, they released the first &quot;true&quot; April Wine album in a decade, &quot;Attitude&quot;. It was certified gold in Canada soon after its release. Segal remained with the band through one more studio release, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Frigate&quot;. Each year, for the next five years, they went out on tour, playing with, among others, Def Leppard, Foreigner, Meat Loaf, Loverboy, Peter Frampton, Blue Öyster Cult and Nazareth.

The band released another album in 2001, entitled &quot;Back to the Mansion&quot;. Also in 2001, the band&#x27;s song &quot;Roller&quot; was featured in the movie &quot;Joe Dirt&quot;. Then in 2003, they released the live album called &quot;Greatest Hits Live 2003&quot;. In the meantime, various labels released several compilation albums.

In 2004 Silverline released April Wine&#x27;s first DVD-A called &quot;From the Front Row ... Live!&quot;. From 2001 to 2004 their live shows included Carl Dixon (formerly of the bands Coney Hatch, and The Guess Who) on guitars, keyboards and backing vocals.

April Wine entered into its 37th year as a band in 2006. On October 31 of that year, Aquarius Records released &quot;April Wine Rocks!&quot;, a new compilation of April Wine favourites, including a bonus live tune and a new album, entitled &quot;Roughly Speaking&quot;, was released on November 28, 2006. At the end of that year, Clench left the band for the second time and was replaced by bassist Breen LeBoeuf. A year later, Mercer announced his retirement; his scheduled final show in Calgary, Alberta, ringing in the 2009 new year, was cancelled due to bad weather. Mercer was replaced by drummer Blair Mackay.

April Wine was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame at the Juno Awards of 2010 in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador. Goodwyn and Greenway accepted the honour.

On November 3, 2010, Jim Clench died in Montreal, of lung cancer, at 61. LeBoeuf left April Wine the following July and was replaced by Richard Lanthier from the Yes tribute band Close to the Edge. Mackay left in March 2012 and was succeeded by Roy &quot;Nip&quot; Nichol, late of the band SamHill. Steve Lang died on February 4, 2017, at age 67, of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Labels continued to release their music; BGO Records released a re-mastered &quot;The Nature Of The Beast / Power Play&quot; in 2020. April Wine continued to tour across Canada annually and to play festivals in Europe and in the United States, with the group consisting of Goodwyn, Greenway, Lanthier, and drummer Roy &quot;Nip&quot; Nichol. They played a concert in Ottawa in September 2021.

Their song &#x27;Sign of the Gypsy Queen&#x27; can be heard in the background in the penultimate Breaking Bad episode Granite State; the guitar solo is playing behind Jesse&#x27;s recorded confession tape being watched by Todd and Uncle Jack in the neo-Nazi compound.

In December 2022 Myles Goodwyn announced that he would no longer be touring with the band, turning over his vocal and guitar duties to Marc Parent: &quot;I&#x27;ve had a long career, happy, fulfilling. I&#x27;ve seen much of the world and I&#x27;m grateful to continuing support of radio and our fans worldwide, but touring has been very difficult in recent years because of my diabetes and my health comes first, so unfortunately, my touring days are officially over.&quot; He only focused on writing and recording. He played his final show with the group in early March 2023 with original April Wine member Jim Henman coming out on stage to take a bow during his farewell speach. Goodwyn died in Halifax, Nova Scotia on December 3, 2023, at the age of 75.

<text>Enontekiö (; ; ; ; ) is a municipality in the Finnish part of Lapland with approximately inhabitants. It is situated in the outermost northwest of the country and occupies a large and very sparsely populated area of about between the Swedish and Norwegian border. Finland&#x27;s highest point, the Halti fell, with a height of above the mean sea level, is situated in the north of Enontekiö. The municipality shares borders with regions of Sweden and Norway that encompass the Scandinavian Mountains. The administrative centre of Enontekiö is the village of Hetta. About one fifth of the community&#x27;s population are Sami people. Enontekiö&#x27;s main industries are tourism and reindeer husbandry.

==Geography==
===Location and dimensions===

Enontekiö is located in the region of Lapland in the outermost northwest tip of Finland. The salient between the Swedish and Norwegian borders, which is occupied by the municipality of Enontekiö, is called &quot;Käsivarsi&quot; (Finnish for &quot;arm&quot;), because before World War II, Finland&#x27;s borders had the shape of a woman&#x27;s figure (&quot;Suomi-neito&quot;) and the area looked like her raised right arm. The municipality occupies a large and sparsely populated area of (more than three times the area of Luxembourg). Thus Enontekiö is Finland&#x27;s third-largest municipality in size, after Inari and Sodankylä, and with a population density of only , it is the second-most sparsely populated municipality, after Savukoski.

Enontekiö&#x27;s neighbouring municipalities are Inari in the east, Kittilä in the southeast, and Muonio in the south; on the Swedish side in the west, there is Kiruna Municipality and on the Norwegian side in the north, there are Storfjord Municipality, Gáivuotna Municipality (also known as Kåfjord), Nordreisa Municipality, and Kautokeino Municipality. Enontekiö shares a border of more than with the two adjacent nations. The border to Sweden is formed by the river Muonionjoki and its tributary, Könkämäeno.

===Villages===
The main village of Enontekiö is the settlement of Hetta in the south, with approx. 530 inhabitants. There is no village with the name of Enontekiö, but Hetta is often called the municipality&#x27;s name. Other important places are the village of Kilpisjärvi, which is located near the border triangle of Finland-Sweden-Norway, as well as Karesuvanto and Palojoensuu, both of which are located at the Muonionjoki at the Swedish border. Enontekiö&#x27;s villages are concentrated in the southern area and along the banks of the rivers Könkämäeno and Muonionjoki in the west of the municipality. Often, there is a corresponding village on the Swedish side of the river, bearing the same name (or the Swedish form of the name), e.g. Karesuvanto/Karesuando. In contrast, the part of the Käsivarsi Mountains away from the rivers is almost completely uninhabited.

===Topography===

In its northern region, Enontekiö shares borders with areas of Sweden and Norway in which segments of the Scandinavian Mountains are located. Through that and through its location in the far north of Finland, it is geologically and scenically very different from the rest of the country. Halti, the highest mountain of Finland with a height of 1,324 m, is located in Enontekiö, together with all 21 other mountains higher than in the country. Besides Haltitunturi, probably the best known and scenically most distinctive mountain is the Saana with a height of , which rises above the village of Kilpisjärvi. The southern part of the municipality is less mountainous, but some single fjells (&quot;tunturi&quot;, which means hills towering above the timber line) rise above the otherwise rather flat surrounding area. Below, a part of the Pallastunturi–Ounastunturi-massif extends into Enontekiö&#x27;s territory.

A little more than 5% of the municipality&#x27;s area consists of water. Several large rivers originate in Enontekiö: The Muonionjoki, Ounasjoki, Ivalojoki, and one of the headstreams of the Tenojoki have their sources in the municipality. Enontekiö owes its name to them: &quot;Eno&quot; is an old Finnish word for &quot;major river&quot; cognate with the Northern Sámi word &quot;Eatnu&quot; or &quot;large river, largest river (in a specific region)&quot; and &quot;tekiö&quot; is derived from the Northern Sámi derivational suffix &quot;-dat&quot; which forms abstract nouns. All of the 825 lakes in the area are rather small. The largest lakes are the Pöyrisjärvi, the Kilpisjärvi near the village with the same name, and the Ounasjärvi near Hetta.

===Flora and fauna===

The vegetation of Enontekiö is very meagre, due to the extreme northern latitude. The northern border of the natural geographic range of the spruce approx. matches the southern border of the municipality; the range of the pine ends only north of Hetta, too. North of that, only birches grow. The timber line is approximately ; above that, a tundra-like vegetation predominates. Heaths extends above timber line.

The lower heathlands are dominated by shrubs such as Betula nana, Vaccinium myrtillus and Empetrum hermaphroditum, whereas in the fjell heaths at higher elevations Salix herbacea, Empetrum and alpine grasses with lichens and mosses occur. In the mountains of the north-west Cassiope tetragona is abundant. The largest part of the municipal area consists of these plateaus or bogs, which mainly predominate at the rivers. Only 19% of Enontekiö&#x27;s area is afforested. About 70% of the total area is conservation area of various grades. Enontekiö contains parts of the Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park, as well as the wilderness areas of Käsivarsi, Pulju, Pöyrisjärvi and Tarvantovaara.

Due to the harsh climatic conditions, there are not especially many species among Enontekiö&#x27;s fauna; however, there are Arctic species that are unknown to southern Finland, e.g. Norway lemming, Arctic fox, snowy owl, Eurasian dotterel, ptarmigan, and ring ouzel. Besides the semi-domesticated reindeer, there are a lot of small mammals and bird species.

===Climate===
Enontekiö&#x27;s climate is characterised by the extreme northern location, the high altitude compared to the rest of Finland and the closeness of the Arctic Ocean. Due to the moderating influence of the Gulf Stream, the winters are not quite as harsh as in central Lapland, which is characterised by the continental climate, but the summers are shorter and cooler.

The annual average temperatures of Enontekiö are the lowest of Finland. In Kilpisjärvi, in the north of the municipal area, the long-term average is −2.3 °C (compared to Helsinki: approx. +5 °C; Berlin approx. +9 °C). July is the warmest month, with an average temperature of +10.9 °C, the coldest is January with −13.6 °C. Due to these extreme climatic conditions, the growing season only lasts a little over 100 days. Thus, the winter, with its 200 days, is very long. The annual average precipitation is . In the cold season, enormous amounts of snow can fall: The highest snow depth ever recorded in Finland was measured on April 19, 1997, in Kilpisjärvi: . Normally, a permanent snow cover is generally formed in October and does not melt again until the end of May. In sheltered places, snow can remain even longer; thus a ski race is traditionally held for Midsummer&#x27;s night in Kilpisjärvi.

Enontekiö&#x27;s municipal area is located between 200 and 300 km north of the Arctic Circle. Accordingly, there are extreme seasonal differences in the length of daylight. In Kilpisjärvi, the Midnight Sun shines between May 22 and July 23. Accordingly, Polar night (&quot;kaamos&quot;) prevails between December 2 and January 11. Enontekiö has the highest rate of occurrence of Polar lights in Finland: In the region around Kilpisjärvi, this natural spectacle can be observed on average three out of four nights during the dark season in clear weather.

==History==
===Prehistory and Swedish age===
The first human settlement in Enontekiö emerged after the retreat of the glaciers at the end of the last ice age, when people of the Komsa culture migrated from the coast of the Arctic Ocean. The oldest traces of settlement were found at the shores of the Ounasjärvi Lake and are dated to a time 6,000 BC. Later, the Sami population of Lapland, which predominated for a long time in Enontekiö, developed by the blending of this stone-age ancestral population with speakers of Uralic languages, who immigrated after the 3rd millennium BC. Initially, the inhabitants of Enontekiö made their living from hunting and fishing, and they had only a few reindeer as draught animals.

In early modern times, Enontekiö came under Swedish influence during the course of the Christianisation of the shamanistic Sami. In the 16th century, Enontekiö&#x27;s first church was built. It was a small wooden building in the village of Rounala on the right shore (today in Sweden) of the Könkämäeno river. According to tradition, the church was erected by three Sami brothers who had converted to Christianity. It was a central meeting point, where Sami people gathered for religious ceremonies, where merchants travelled to sell their wares, and where Swedish officials held judicial courts at particular times. In 1611, a new church was built in the village of Markkina. After the destruction of this church, another one was erected in the same place in 1661.

Since the end of the 17th century, the reindeer-Sami culture, which was based on keeping large herds of reindeer, spread from Norwegian and Swedish Lapland to Enontekiö. The reindeer-Sami of Enontekiö had a nomadic way of life; they moved with their animals between the coniferous forests in the south to Kåfjord, Kvænangen, and Nordreisa (in Norway) on the coast of the Arctic Ocean following the annual cycle of summer and winter grazing land. Enontekiö&#x27;s last nomads did not settle down until the 1960s, but the culture of the reindeer-Sami is still preserved in the large-scale herding of reindeer. As of the 17th century, the first Finnish people settled down in the south of Enontekiö and introduced the culture of settled agriculture. Due to the Finnish immigration and the assimilation of the old-established Sami population, a Finnish majority emerged over the years.

===Period of Russian sovereignty===
In 1809 when Sweden ceded the region of today&#x27;s Finland to Russia in the Treaty of Fredrikshamn, Enontekiö became a part of the newly founded Grand Duchy of Finland, too. Because the church of Markkina stood on the Swedish—and therefore wrong—side of the river after the Swedish-Russian demarcation, it was torn down in 1826. Its beams were shipped down the Muoniojoki to Palojoensuu, where the church was rebuilt as henceforth the fourth church of Enontekiö. Already in 1864, the church was again moved to Hetta, which had in the meantime became the largest settlement of the region. The closing of the Russian-Norwegian border in 1852 and of the Russian-Swedish border in 1889 had severe consequences for Enontekiö&#x27;s reindeer-nomads, because they could no longer move with their herds to the coast of the Arctic Ocean. As a result, they transferred their grazing areas inland to the southeast and helped spread the culture of reindeer-herding to the remaining parts of Lapland. Due to the separation of the administration of the municipality from the church administration, the political municipality of Enontekiö came into existence in 1877.

===After independence===

With the Finnish declaration of independence in 1917, Enontekiö became a part of the independent republic of Finland, too.

During the Continuation War (1941–1944), where Finland allied with Germany in fighting against the Soviet Union, Enontekiö, together with all of northern Finland, was part of the operational region of the Wehrmacht. In 1942, the Germans in Enontekiö started to establish the Sturmbock emplacement in occupied Norway and in Petsamo in order to protect the harbours on the Arctic Ocean. When Finland concluded the Moscow Armistice with the Soviet Union on September 4, 1944, committing themselves to expel the German troops, the Finnish-German Lapland War broke out. Lapland&#x27;s civilian population had to be moved to a safe place in a very short time. Enontekiö&#x27;s population was evacuated to neutral Sweden together with all of western Lapland&#x27;s inhabitants. After the Germans quickly left southern Lapland, the 12,000 soldiers of the 7th &quot;Gebirgsdivision&quot; (Mountain Division) of the Wehrmacht occupied the Sturmbock emplacement at the end of October. During their fallback, the German applied the tactics of scorched earth and devastated Enontekiö, too. During the cold winter, a war of attrition was maintained between German troops, barricaded in their fortifications, and Finnish troops, who took a stand in Markkina. After the Wehrmacht had abandoned Petsamo and northern Norway, the Sturmbock emplacement was no longer of strategic value and was cleared without a struggle at the beginning of January in 1945. In order to secure the flank in Lyngen Municipality, their last emplacement in northern Norway, the Germans still operated in the north of the Käsivarsi region, where minor combat operations took place, before the last Wehrmacht soldiers left Finnish soil on April 27 at Kilpisjärvi.

==Population==
===Population development and structure===
Enontekiö currently has nearly 2,000 inhabitants. In the beginning 1990s, there were still 2,500 inhabitants. Because the structurally weak Lapland was hit harder by the Finnish economic crisis than the south, a wave of migration to expansion centers in the south started in the middle of the decade. Initially, the number of inhabitants also rapidly decreased in Enontekiö, but it now has consolidated at a lower level. Enontekiö&#x27;s population consists of under the age of 15, between 15 and 64, and older than 64. The excess of men is conspicuous. They account for 53.2% of the population.

===Sami===

Enontekiö is part of the native settlement area of the indigenous Sami people. Nineteen percent of the municipality&#x27;s population are ethnic Sami, but only speak Sami as their native language. The municipality is part of the Sami &quot;homeland&quot; (&quot;kotiseutualue&quot;), which is defined by law and where Sami have special minority rights. Thus Northern Sami, the particular Sami language used in Enontekiö, has official status in the municipality besides the Finnish language, and therefore is allowed to be used in contact with the authorities. Well-known Sami from Enontekiö are the artist, Nils-Aslak Valkeapää and the Joik-singer Wimme.

===Religion===
Enontekiö&#x27;s Evangelical Lutherans are part of the parish of Enontekiö, which is subordinate to the diocese of Oulu. It has been an independent parish since 1916, it had previously been a chapel parish of Muonio. As in the rest of Lapland, the Laestadianism, a conservative Lutheran movement of the Great Awakening, is strongly represented in Enontekiö. The Laestadian are organised within the Evangelical Lutheran Church. From 1826 to 1849, Lars Levi Laestadius, the founder of the Laestadianism, was pastor in Karesuando in Sweden, from where his doctrine quickly spread to the adjacent Enontekiö. The first awakening in Finland took place in the winter of 1846/47 in Enontekiö and Muonio.

==Politics==
===Parliamentary elections===
Results of the 2019 Finnish parliamentary election in Enontekiö:

* Centre Party 38.2%
* True Finns 15.2%
* National Coalition Party 14.7%
* Social Democratic Party 12.7%
* Swedish People&#x27;s Party 0,3%
* Left Alliance 4.8%
* Green League 9.0%
* Christian Democrats 3.4%

===Administration===
After some contested decisions have been made during the 2017-2021 election period, some members of the formerly dominating Centre Party established the independent list &quot;Enontekiöläisten ääni&quot; (&quot;Voice of the people of Enontekiö&quot;). In the 2021 elections of the municipal council, which is the highest instance for local affairs, the new list &quot;Enontekiöläisten ääni&quot; gained the most votes and now provides five out of 17 representatives to the municipal council. Both of the large parties in rural Finland, the National Coalition Party and the Centre Party have three seats in the municipal council each. The Green league and the local Sami list of &quot;Johtti Sápmelaččat&quot; have two representatives each. Like &quot;Enontekiöläisten ääni,&quot; also the Finns Party is new to the municipal council. The Finns Party as well as the Christian Democrats provide one representative to the municipal council each. Since 2017 the National Coalition Party and the Christian Democrats have been in a local alliance. The number of seats in the local municipal council is 17.

===Coat of arms===

Enontekiö&#x27;s coat of arms was designed by Olof Eriksson. It depicts a silver, red-armoured Willow grouse in a blue field. The willow grouse is a very prevalent bird in Northern Lapland and was an important food for Enontekiö&#x27;s inhabitants in the past, which is why it is also called the &quot;bird of life&quot;.

===Twin municipalities===
Enontekiö is a twin municipality with three of its neighbouring municipalities, Kiruna Municipality in Sweden, Storfjord Municipality in Norway, and Kautokeino Municipality in Norway.

==Economy and infrastructure==
===Economy===

Enontekiö&#x27;s economic structure has a large percentage involved in the service sector: 76% of the gainfully employed population work in the tertiary sector, 45% of these work in civil service. Agriculture and forestry employ 13% of Enontekiö&#x27;s inhabitants, the manufacturing sector 6%. As is usual in the structurally weak Lapland, the unemployment in Enontekiö is a big problem: In January 2007 with 24.7%, the municipality had the second highest unemployment rate of all Finnish municipalities. In 1996 at the peak of the Finnish economic crisis, the unemployment rate was near 40%.

Reindeer husbandry was the dominant branch of business in Enontekiö for a long time. In the northwest of Lapland, reindeer husbandry has already been done for centuries, in contrast to the other regions of the Finnish reindeer husbandry area, where it was only introduced on a large scale in the 19th century after the eradication of the wild Finnish forest reindeer (&quot;Rangifer tarandus fennicus&quot;). Reindeer husbandry plays an important role even today. The herders are organised in the cooperatives (&quot;paliskunta&quot;) of Näkkälä and Käsivarsi and have a total of 20,000 semi-domesticated reindeer. Due to the climatic conditions, agriculture is scarcely possible, but dairy farming is operated on a small scale. Due to the sparse vegetation, forestry plays only a minor role.

Tourism is a major branch of business in Enontekiö, even if there are fewer visitors than in those municipalities of Lapland which have big skiing centres. Enontekiö mostly attracts nature tourists, who travel to Lapland for hiking, fishing, canoeing, skiing or snowmobiling, as well as automobile tourists, such as those on their way to the North Cape. Annually, more than 100,000 overnight stays are registered. Twenty percent of the tourists are from abroad. The largest group are the Norwegians, followed by the Germans, Swedes, Dutch, and British. The Norwegians visit Enontekiö mainly for its low prices. The Norwegian shopping tourism made up 40% of the retail business volume in all of Enontekiö, and even 60–70% in Kilpisjärvi, near the border.

===Transportation===

Enontekiö&#x27;s most important traffic connection is highway 21 (E8). Along its entire route, starting in Tornio at the Gulf of Bothnia, it follows the line of the Finnish–Swedish border and ends in Kilpisjärvi at the Norwegian border. The main road 93 branches off highway 21 at Palojoensuu and at first leads in an eastward direction to the municipal centre of Hetta and then further in a northward direction to the Norwegian border. The villages of the southern part of the municipality are connected to each other by small roads. But in the northern part of Enontekiö, highway 21 is the only road, taking a course next to the banks of the Muonionjoki and Könkämäeno; the uninhabited area between the river valley and the Norwegian border has no roads at all. There are three border crossings in Enontekiö: The village of Karesuvanto is connected by a bridge with the Swedish bank and there are border crossings to Norway in Kilpisjärvi and Kivilompolo.

The municipality has its own airport, (Enontekiö Airport), west of Hetta. It is mainly approached by charter flights, whose passengers account for 95% of the airport&#x27;s passenger volume. Regular flights to Enontekiö are established only in the spring. The company Finncomm Airlines provides direct flights to Enontekiö from Helsinki-Vantaa between March and May. The passenger volume of 13,700 passengers per year is relatively low.

Enontekiö is not connected to the railroad network. The next railroad station is in Kolari, approximately to the south.

===Education and social affairs===
There are five primary schools in Enontekiö: In the Kilpisjärvi primary school, pupils are taught from preschool to 9th grade, in the schools of Karesuvanto, Hetta, and Peltojärvi, from preschool to 6th grade. Enontekiö&#x27;s upper school is attended by pupils of the 7th to 9th grade. The higher education entrance qualification can be obtained after graduating from the upper school at the secondary school of Enontekiö. The primary schools of Kilpisjärvi and Karesuvanto and the upper school of Enontekiö offer native language education to Sami pupils. Adult education takes place at an adult education centre. The municipality&#x27;s library is located in the main village of Hetta, more remote regions are supplied by a mobile library. The University of Helsinki runs a biological research station in Kilpisjärvi. The University of Oulu runs the KAIRA radio telescope facility at Kilpisjärvi as well.

Healthcare is organised together with the neighbouring municipality of Muonio. In Enontekiö, there are two health centres for inpatient treatment, one in Hetta and one in Karesuvanto. Beds are available in Muonio&#x27;s health centre.

==Culture and sightseeing==
===Buildings===

The church of Enontekiö was built in the central village of Hetta in 1951/52 as a replacement for its predecessor, which was destroyed during the Lapland war; it is the sixth church of the municipality. It is a modern building made from brick and concrete and designed by the architect, Veikko Larkas. The slender church tower is 30 m high and is connected to the nave by a porch. The artist Uuno Eskola made the altarpiece of the church with a combination of fresco and mosaic techniques. It depicts the resurrected Jesus Christ, who is blessing Lapland and its people. The church&#x27;s organ was a gift from Germany from 1958.

Due to their preserved old building structure, the villages of Kultima, Näkkälä, Nunnanen, Peltovuoma, Pöyrisjärvi, and Raittijärvi are officially listed cultural monuments. The stone bridge of Ahdaskuru, erected in 1943 near the Norwegian border, is also listed; it is the only bridge in Lapland which was not destroyed during the Lapland War.

===Museums===
There are three museums in Enontekiö: The buildings of the museum of local history, which opened in 1991, were moved to Hetta from different villages in the municipality. They are a farmhouse from Raattama from the end of the 19th century, a living room from Ylikyrö from the 1920s, a storehouse also from Ylikyrö from the 18th century, a sauna from Muotkajärvi built in 1937, and a cattle shed from Kaukonen in the neighbouring municipality of Kittilä. The nature and culture centre of Fjell-Lapland is maintained by the Finnish Forest Office (&quot;Metsähallitus&quot;) and is located in Hetta, too. With its exhibitions, it shows the nature of northern Lapland and the culture of the reindeer-Sami. In Järämä, approximately 20 km north of Karesuvanto, a part of the Sturmbock emplacement from the Lapland War was restored. Since 1997, there is an annexed museum, dealing with the history of the Lapland War in Enontekiö.

===Regular events===
Since 1971, a Sami cultural event, the Mary&#x27;s Days of Hetta (&quot;Hetan Marianpäivät&quot;), is held at the beginning of March. It continues the old Sami tradition of meeting in the church village on special holidays. Today, Mary&#x27;s Days include performances of Sami music, art exhibitions, contests of riding a reindeer sleigh and roping. At Easter, a church and chamber music festival, the Music Days of Hetta (&quot;Hetan musiikkipäivät&quot;), is held in Enontekiö. From the end of April to the beginning of May, a contest of ice fishing (&quot;Kilpisjärven pilkkiviikot&quot;) attracts fishermen. In late summer, a tournament of orienteering (&quot;Suomen tunturisuunnistus&quot;) is held on the fells near Kilpisjärvi.

<doc id="374491" wikidata="Q1850749" url="?curid=374491" title="Speaker of the Riksdag">
<text>The speaker of the [[Riksdag]] () is the presiding officer of the national unicameral legislature in Sweden.

The Riksdag underwent profound changes in 1867, when the medieval Riksdag of the Estates was abolished. The new form of the Riksdag included two elected chambers, each with its own speaker. Since the &quot;de facto&quot; introduction of parliamentarism in 1917, the Riksdag has properly functioned as the institution to which the prime minister and the government are held accountable. In 1971 the institution was transformed into a unicameral legislature with 350 members, reduced to 349 in 1976 to avoid parliamentary deadlocks. Since 1975, in accordance with the Instrument of Government of 1974, it is the speaker and no longer the monarch who appoints and dismisses the prime minister.

The current speaker is Andreas Norlén, who has held the gavel since September 2018.

== Duties of the speaker ==

The speaker is the head and presiding officer of the Riksdag, and is elected by the chamber as the first order of business when the Riksdag re-convenes following a general election. As such, the speaker coordinates the work that takes place in the Riksdag. The office is mandated in the Swedish constitution and the duties of the office are set out in the Instrument of Government (1974) and the Riksdag Act.

The speaker themselves does not take part in debates, nor do they participate in the parliamentary committees. Consequently, they have no vote, and a substitute is appointed to fill his or her seat in the Riksdag during their time in office. While the speaker is still one of the elected representatives of the Riksdag, they are expected to remain unbiased and objective with regards to the political issues that are debated.

In terms of official protocol, the position of speaker is the second highest-ranked public position in Sweden. Only the monarch outranks the speaker since the monarch is the head of state. Additionally, the speaker nominally outranks the prime minister of Sweden, even though (since the 1974–75 reforms) that person is the country&#x27;s &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot; chief executive.

===Appointment and dismissal of the prime minister===
One of the more important aspects of the work of the speaker is to head negotiations concerning the forming of a new government in case there is a shift of power after an election. The speaker can then dismiss a prime minister who is voted out of office, which happened for the first time on 25 September 2018. After the negotiations, the speaker proposes the new prime ministerial candidate to the chamber, and following a positive vote, the speaker signs the commission () on behalf of the Riksdag. The prime minister appoints and dismisses their own cabinet ministers, forming the government (), without the involvement of the speaker.

In case of either a voluntary resignation or a vote of no confidence, the letter of resignation of a prime minister is handed to the speaker.

In most other parliamentary systems, including other constitutional monarchies, these duties are instead handled by the head of state. Relieving the Swedish monarch of political powers, although not the key objective from the outset, nevertheless became an important part of constitutional reform in the 1970s.

The speaker also attends the special change-of-government council held at the Stockholm Palace following the appointment of a new prime minister. During these meetings the speaker informs the monarch on the procedure of forming the incoming government. The monarch then announces the change of government.

===Deputy speakers===
The speaker is assisted by three deputy speakers who are also elected by the chamber. Traditionally, the second, third and fourth largest parties gets to name of one of their members for these offices. There is some disagreement whether the &quot;largest party&quot; or the &quot;leading party of the largest party bloc&quot; should hold the speakership (and thus also the position of First Deputy Speaker).
Unlike the Speaker (and cabinet ministers), the deputy Speakers are not replaced by an alternate and remain members of the Riksdag with voting rights.

===Regent ad interim===
In case all adult members of the Swedish royal family who are in the line of succession to the throne, as prescribed in the Act of Succession, are out of the country, the speaker assumes the role of &quot;Regent ad interim&quot; (). This would also be the case if they were all to decease.

Below are listed all speakers who have acted as Regent ad interim: 

* Ingemund Bengtsson (2-3 July 1988)

===Riksdag Board===
The speaker chairs the Riksdag Board (), which deliberates on the organisation of the work of the Riksdag, directs the work of the Riksdag Administration () and decides upon matters of major significance concerning the international contacts programme.

===War Delegation===
The speaker chairs the War Delegation (), when it is deemed necessary to convene.

<text>Bridgnorth is a market town and civil parish in Shropshire, England. The River Severn splits it into High Town and Low Town, the upper town on the right bank and the lower on the left bank of the River Severn. The population at the 2011 Census was 12,079.

==History==

Bridgnorth is named after a bridge over the River Severn, which was built further north than an earlier bridge at Quatford. The earliest historical reference to the town is in 895, when it is recorded that the Danes created a camp at &quot;Cwatbridge&quot;; subsequently in 912, Æthelfleda constructed a mound on the west bank of the River Severn, or possibly on the site of Bridgnorth Castle, as part of an offensive against the Danes. Earliest names for Bridgnorth include Brigge, Brug and Bruges, all referring to its position on the Severn.

After the Norman conquest, William I granted the manor of Bridgnorth to Roger de Montgomerie. The town itself was not created until 1101, when Robert of Bellême, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury, the son of Roger de Montgomerie, moved from Quatford, constructing a castle and a church on the site of the modern-day town. The town became a royal borough on Robert Bellême&#x27;s attainder in 1102. The castle&#x27;s purpose was to defend against attacks from Wales. The town was attacked and burnt by Roger Mortimer, 1st Earl of March during the Despenser War in 1322. A small Jewish community was established in the town in 1267, but was expelled in 1274; one of the community was arrested in a campaign against alleged Jewish coin clipping, a prelude towards Edward I&#x27;s Edict of Expulsion in 1290.

Bridgnorth&#x27;s town walls were initially constructed in timber between 1216 and 1223; murage grants allowed them to be upgraded to stone between the 13th and 15th centuries. By the 16th century, the antiquarian John Leland reported them in ruins and of the five gates, only one survives today.
It is probable that Henry I granted the burgesses certain privileges, for Henry II confirmed to them all the franchises and customs which they had had in the time of Henry I. King John in 1215 granted them freedom from toll throughout England except the city of London, and in 1227 Henry III conferred several new rights and liberties, among which were a gild merchant with a hanse. These early charters were confirmed by several succeeding kings, Henry VI granting in addition Assize of Bread and Ale and other privileges. The burgesses were additionally granted two fairs: a yearly fair on the feast of the Translation of St Leonard and the three following days was granted in 1359, and in 1630 Charles I granted them licence to hold another fair on the Thursday before the first week in Lent and two following days. The burgesses returned two members to parliament in 1295, and continued to do so until 1867, when they were assigned only one member. The town was disfranchised in 1885.

During the Civil War, Bridgnorth was one of the Midlands&#x27; main royalist strongholds, and in 1642 many royalist troops were garrisoned there. In 1646, Cromwell&#x27;s Roundheads arrived with orders to take Bridgnorth for the Parliamentarians from the garrison led by Sir Robert Howard. After a three-week siege, Cromwell was successful and he ordered that the castle be demolished.

Bridgnorth had an ironworks in Low Town run by Hazledine and Company which in 1808 built the locomotive &quot;Catch Me Who Can&quot; designed and promoted by Richard Trevithick. A plaque on the foundry&#x27;s site commemorates this association.

By 1824, the borough and liberties of Bridgnorth were well defined.

The population of the municipal borough in 1841 was 6,198, and that of the town was 5,770.

More than 255 men from the Bridgnorth area volunteered in the first months of the First World War. Their names were published in the Bridgnorth Journal on 26 December 1914 and those killed in action are remembered on the war memorial, sculpted by Adrian Jones, in the castle grounds.

Until 1961 the Royal Air Force&#x27;s initial recruit training unit was at RAF Bridgnorth, a station opened in 1939. During the Second World War, two women were killed in a German air raid in August 1940 when bombs hit neighbouring houses in High Town. In 2005, unverified German papers dating from 1941 were found, outlining new details about Operation Sea Lion, the military plans of Nazi Germany for an invasion of Britain. Two quiet Shropshire towns were mentioned in the documentation: Ludlow and Bridgnorth. Some experts believe that it was Hitler&#x27;s intention to make Bridgnorth his personal headquarters in Britain, due to its central position in the UK, rural location, rail connections and airfield.

In 1978, Bridgnorth was twinned with the French town of Thiers, and in 1992 it also twinned with the Bavarian town of Schrobenhausen, Germany that had already twinned with Thiers a few years earlier. On 21 August 2003 Bridgnorth was granted Fairtrade Town status.

==Geography==
The town is in the Severn Valley, where the river passes through a relatively narrow valley with largely-wooded slopes. High Town, the part of the town sited on the west side of the Severn, is built on a notable promontory, at the southern end of which the castle was constructed, and is known as Castle Hill. Low Town is on lower-lying ground on the banks of the river. High Town is at an elevation of 65–68 metres (213–223 feet) above sea level, whilst Low Town is at 32–33 metres (105 feet). The lie of the land of Low Town is less hilly but then rises steeply to its immediate east.

The West Midlands Green Belt covers the countryside to the east of the Severn and the settlement.

The civil parish includes Danesford, Oldbury and Quatford.

==Landmarks==
Bridgnorth is home to a funicular railway that links the High and Low towns, the Castle Hill Railway, which is the steepest and only inland railway of its type in England. Additionally, within the High Town is Bridgnorth railway station on the Severn Valley Railway, which runs southwards to Kidderminster.
The ruins of Bridgnorth Castle, built in 1101, are present in the town. Due to damage caused during the English Civil War, the castle is inclined at an angle of 15 degrees.

High Town has two prominent Church of England churches. Church of St. Mary Magdalene, Bridgnorth, a church built in the classic style of the late 18th century, was designed by Thomas Telford; and is still used for worship. St. Leonard&#x27;s was formerly collegiate, and Bridgnorth was a Royal Peculiar until 1856. It was subsequently largely rebuilt but is no longer used for regular worship. It has many community uses and is in the care of the Churches Conservation Trust.

Bishop Percy&#x27;s House on the Cartway was built in 1580 by Richard Forster and has been a Grade 1 listed building since 18 July 1949. It was one of the few properties of its type to survive the great fire of Bridgnorth in April 1646, and was the birthplace of Thomas Percy (Bishop of Dromore), author of &#x27;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry&#x27;.

Other notable buildings in the town are the 17th century Bridgnorth Town Hall, a half-timbered building, and a surviving town gate the Northgate which houses the museum. Daniel&#x27;s Mill, a well known watermill is situated a short distance along the River Severn from Bridgnorth.

The remains of an old hermitage can be seen from the high town, they are commonly called The Queens Parlor by locals. One local legend tells of its occupation in AD 925 by a hermit called Ethelred or Ethelwald, a grandson to Alfred the Great. This may not be such an unlikely story as Bridgnorth was founded in 912 by Alfred the Great&#x27;s daughter Ethelfleda.
==Education==
There are a number of primary schools in Bridgnorth, including: Castlefields County Primary School, two Church of England schools, St Mary&#x27;s and St Leonard&#x27;s; the Roman Catholic St John&#x27;s school; and, in addition, the Morville and Brown Clee schools.

The town has two secondary schools: Oldbury Wells School and Bridgnorth Endowed School (previously named Bridgnorth Grammar School). These serve the town and its outlying villages, including Alveley and Highley.

There is a sixth form in Bridgnorth, Bridgnorth Sixth Form, which is run within Oldbury Wells School. A consultation was published which outlines consideration of no new student intake in September 2024 and potential closure in September 2025. In September 2023, Telford College made a deal with both Bridgnorth secondary schools.
==Culture==

There is a theatre, the &quot;Theatre on the Steps&quot;, and a 1930s cinema, the Majestic. The Northgate Museum contains many artefacts connected with the town and surrounding area. It was the first independent museum in Shropshire to be accredited by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council. The town has an orchestra, Bridgnorth Sinfonia, which performers regular concerts in St Mary&#x27;s Church in East Castle Street.

===Sport and clubs===

Bridgnorth Town F.C. was the football club based in Bridgnorth. They joined the Worcestershire Combination in 1938 and twice reached the 5th round of the FA Vase. They won the championship of the West Midlands (Regional) League Premier Division in 2008. Affiliated to the club was the junior section known as &quot;Bridgnorth Town Juniors&quot;. The teams ranged from under 8s to under 16s and competed in the Telford Junior League. After folding, the club was effectively replaced by &quot;phoenix club&quot; A.F.C. Bridgnorth.
Bridgnorth Spartans Juniors Football Club run junior and adult teams. These teams include boys&#x27; teams, ranging from Under-8s to Under-15s, girls&#x27; teams and women&#x27;s teams. Home games are played at Oldbury Wells School.

Bridgnorth Rowing Club occupies &#x27;The Maltings&#x27; building on the edge of Severn Park, which was purchased by the club in 1983. Work to convert the malting building into the boat house started in 1993. It competes in events in the local region and further afield, including attending the annual Head of the River Race on the Thames in London, and hosts an annual regatta with racing along the length of the Severn Park.
Bridgnorth Army Cadets is the oldest Army Cadet detachment in Shropshire. The Army Cadet Force (ACF) in 2010 celebrated 150 years.

In 2007, Bridgnorth hosted the UK Downhill Street Race in cycling.

In January 2010, the Kidderminster branch of Stagecoach Theatre Arts expanded to Bridgnorth, providing the town with a part-time performing arts school for people of ages between 6 and 18. The Kidderminster School is now named &quot;Stagecoach Kidderminster &amp; Bridgnorth&quot;.

===Media===
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Wrekin and the local relay TV transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Shropshire, Heart West Midlands, Capital North West and Wales, Smooth West Midlands, Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire, Greatest Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire, and Severnvalley Radio, a community based station.

The town is served by the local newspaper, Shropshire Star (formerly Bridgnorth Journal).

==Transport==
===Roads===
Bridgnorth grew initially as a market town at the centre of a system of local radial roads linking it with more rural, smaller settlements. Many of these roads crossed Bridgnorth at the point on the High Street where the town hall now stands. The River Severn historically also played a major role as a trading connection for the town, but is no longer generally navigable this far upstream.

Bridgnorth is connected to Shrewsbury and Stourbridge by the A458 road, Telford and Kidderminster by the A442 road, and Wolverhampton via the A454 road. The town is from the M54 motorway, at Telford.

The A458 passes to the south of the town centre on a by-pass, construction of which was started in 1982 and now serves to relieve the town centre of the congestion that once plagued it. The bypass also provided a second bridge across the Severn at Bridgnorth, which remains the only local alternative to the historic bridge that connects Low and High towns.

===Buses===
The town is served by buses to and from Telford, Shrewsbury, Wolverhampton, Much Wenlock, Ironbridge, Shifnal and Kidderminster. These are operated by Arriva Midlands, Select Bus Services, and Diamond Bus.

===Railway===

Currently the closest towns with active railway stations on the National Rail network are Telford and Wolverhampton. However, Bridgnorth does still have a station on an active heritage line, the Severn Valley Railway. Bridgnorth station was not the northern terminus of this line when built, but the main intermediate station, being 18 miles from Hartlebury and 22 miles from Shrewsbury. The station, which was opened to the public by the SVR on 1 February 1862, was passed to Great Western Railway (GWR) and then eventually to British Railways in 1948. It closed to passengers after 101 years of service on 8 September 1963 and to freight traffic on 30 November 1963. Although thought by some to have been closed as part of the Beeching cuts, its planned closure pre-dated his report.

The neo-Jacobean station is the only listed railway station on the Severn Valley Railway. Necessitating that, any future plans to enhance visitor facilities will need to be carefully designed to be in keeping with the railway station&#x27;s architecture and historic character.

The line now ends just north of the modern-day station, where the line formerly bridged Hollybush Road and passed through Bridgnorth Tunnel and on to the next station on the line, Linley. There exists an ongoing debate whether the railway should extend beyond its current limits north of Bridgnorth.
===Cliff railway===
The Bridgnorth Cliff Railway, also known as the Bridgnorth Funicular Railway or Castle Hill Railway, is a funicular railway which has operated in Bridgnorth for over 100 years. The line links the lower part of High Town to the upper part. The bottom entrance is adjacent to the River Severn while the top is adjacent to the ruins of Bridgnorth Castle.

Opened on 7 July 1892 to great fanfare and the proclamation of a public holiday, the line is one of four funicular railways in the UK built to the same basic design - the others were the Clifton Rocks Railway in Bristol; the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway in Devon; and the Constitution Hill Railway in Aberystwyth, Wales.

It is one of the steepest railways in the country and at least one source (the information panel outside the top station) claims it is both the steepest and shortest. It is the only functional inland funicular railway in England - there are about 15 more at English seaside towns. Originally, the railway was powered by a simple system using water and gravity, but was converted in 1943–44 to run on electricity. Then, in 1955, new cars were installed on the railway; these were able to carry 18 passengers each and are still in use today. As of return tickets cost £2.00 with discounts available for groups of 15 or more. Single tickets are not available.

The railway allows people to easily get between the two parts of High Town as the only other way down is down 200 steps or by using roads which drastically increase the journey. The terminals at the upper and lower part of the railway are currently used as tea-rooms and guest houses.

The railway was temporarily closed in December 2022 due to damage to a retaining wall and further damage was discovered during repairs. The railway reopened on 4th March 2024.

===Walking and cycling===
Bridgnorth being split between High and Low Towns is connected by at least a dozen steps — for which the place is noted — from the north, going clockwise:
*innominate steps from Love Lane to Bramble Ridge
*Moat St Steps from St Leonard&#x27;s Close to Moat Street
*Granary Steps from St Leonard&#x27;s Close to Friars&#x27; Street

*Library Steps from Castle Walk to Underhill Street
*Cannon Steps from Castle Walk to Hollybush Road
*Folly Hole from New Road to Hollybush Road
*Ebenezer / Railway Steps from New Road to Hollybush Road

The town is on National Route 45 of the Sustrans National Cycle Network, which is named the Mercian Way.

The long-distance trail called the Geopark Way begins in the town.

Every year since 1967, a sponsored walk has been held in Bridgnorth. Since 2017 this has been organised by the Bridgnorth Lions Club.

==Economy==
On the eastern side of the town is a large aluminium works, founded in the 1950s.

==Governance==
The town council has sixteen members, with four elected from each of the four wards that cover the civil parish (named Castle, Morfe, East, and West). Castle ward includes Oldbury, while Morfe ward includes Danesford and Quatford.

Local government and services are otherwise provided by Shropshire Council and the town elects four of its members — one electoral division comprises East and Morfe wards together with Astley Abbotts, and the other comprises West and Castle wards together with Tasley. From 1974 until 2009, there was also Bridgnorth District Council, a tier of local government between the county and town councils.

<text>The Woodwardian Professor of Geology is a professorship held in the Department of Earth Sciences at the University of Cambridge. It was founded by John Woodward in 1728 under the title of Professor of Fossils. Woodward&#x27;s will left to the University a large collection of fossils and also dictated that the professor should be elected by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of Ely, the President of the Royal Society, the President of the Royal College of Physicians, the Member of Parliament for the University of Cambridge, and the University Senate.

<text>Bridport is a market town and civil parish in Dorset, England, inland from the English Channel near the confluence of the River Brit and its tributary the Asker. Its origins are Saxon and it has a long history as a rope-making centre. On the coast and within the town&#x27;s boundary is West Bay, a small fishing harbour also known as Bridport Harbour.

The town features as Port Bredy in Thomas Hardy&#x27;s Wessex novels. In the 21st century, Bridport&#x27;s arts scene has expanded with an arts centre, theatre, cinema and museum.

In the 2011 census the population of Bridport&#x27;s built-up area was 13,568. The town is twinned with Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue, France.

== History ==
Bridport&#x27;s origins are Saxon. During the reign of King Alfred it became one of the four most important settlements in Dorset – the other three being Dorchester, Shaftesbury and Wareham – with the construction of fortifications and establishment of a mint.

Bridport&#x27;s name probably derives from another location nearby. In the early 10th century the Burghal Hidage recorded the existence of a fortified centre or burh in this area, called &#x27;Brydian&#x27;, which is generally accepted as referring to Bridport. &#x27;Brydian&#x27; means &#x27;place at the (River) Bride&#x27;, and this name may have come from an earlier burh in the Bride Valley a few miles to the east, which perhaps was abandoned or not completed in favour of the harbour site at Bridport. A probable location for an earlier burh is at Littlebredy. In 1086 the Domesday Book recorded that the town was called &#x27;Brideport&#x27;; &#x27;port&#x27; is Old English for a market town, thus &#x27;Brideport&#x27; may have described the market town belonging to or associated with Bredy. At a later date, in a reversal of a more typical derivation, the town lent its name to the river on which it stood; previously this had been the River Wooth, but it became the River Brit.

The Domesday Book recorded that Bridport had 120 houses in the reign of Edward the Confessor (1042–1066). In 1253 the town was awarded its first charter by Henry III, and by the subsequent reign of Edward I Bridport sent two members to Parliament. In the 14th and 15th centuries, like other Dorset coastal towns, Bridport suffered heavy losses due to frequent outbreaks of the Black Death; one 14th-century account by Geoffrey Baker recorded that the disease &quot;almost stripped the seaports of Dorset of their inhabitants&quot;. Around this time the town was also subjected to attacks by raiding French and Spanish forces.

Since the Middle Ages Bridport has been associated with the production of rope and nets. The earliest official record of this industry dates from 1211, when King John ordered that Bridport make &quot;as many ropes for ships both large and small and as many cables as you can&quot;. The raw materials needed, flax and hemp, used to be grown in the surrounding countryside, though they were superseded in modern times by artificial fibres such as nylon. Bridport&#x27;s main street is particularly wide due to it previously having been used to dry the ropes, after they had been spun in long gardens behind the houses. Ropes for gallows used to be made in the town, hence the phrase &quot;stabbed with a Bridport dagger&quot; being used to describe a hanging.
In the English Civil War (1642–1651) the population of Bridport mainly supported the royalists. At the end of the war in 1651 Charles II briefly stayed in the town at The George Inn as he sought to escape Parliamentarian forces after his defeat at the Battle of Worcester. Local loyalty to the king again played a part in the first action in the Duke of Monmouth&#x27;s Rebellion when on 16 June 1685, 40 cavalry and 400 foot soldiers, commanded for Monmouth, moved on from Lyme Regis to Bridport, where they encountered 1,200 men from the local royalist Dorset militia. The skirmish ended with retreat of the rebel force, although many of the militiamen deserted and joined Monmouth&#x27;s army.

Many buildings in Bridport, particularly in the main street, date from the 18th century. Bridport Town Hall was built in 1785–6, with its clock tower and cupola added about twenty years later. Older buildings can be found in South Street, and include the 13th-century St. Mary&#x27;s parish church, the 14th-century chantry and the 16th-century Bridport Museum.

The population of Bridport in 1841 was 4,787. During the 19th century Bridport&#x27;s population grew little, unlike many Dorset towns, although many sturdy buildings were constructed at this time, showing that at least parts of the population remained prosperous. In 1857 the Bridport Railway was opened, which joined the town with the existing national rail network. This benefitted the town&#x27;s textile industry and brought cheaper goods such as coal to the area. In 1884 the line was extended from Bridport&#x27;s station to a new terminus on the coast at Bridport Harbour, which was renamed West Bay as part of attempts to promote it as a resort. The West Bay extension closed to passengers in 1930 and all traffic in 1962. The entire Bridport line closed in 1975.

The town gave its name to Bridport, Vermont and Bridport, Tasmania.

==Governance==
In the UK national parliament, Bridport is within the West Dorset parliamentary constituency. , the Member of Parliament (MP) is Edward Morello of the Liberal Democrats.

Bridport has two-tiers of local government. At the lower level, Bridport is a civil parish governed by a town council of 20 members elected from 5 wards representing neighbourhoods of the town. At the upper level, Bridport is part of Dorset unitary authority. Bridport electoral ward (which also includes neighbouring Symondsbury) elects 3 of the 82 members to Dorset Council.

In 1835 Bridport became a municipal borough, the district contained only the parish of Bridport from 1894. in 1974 the district and parish were abolished and it became part of West Dorset district. A successor parish was formed covering the same area as the former district and its parish. In 2019 Bridport became part of Dorset unitary authority area. The rural hinterland around the town formed Bridport Rural District from 1894 to 1974.

On 1 April 2024 the parishes of Bothenhampton and Allington were abolished and merged with Bridport, part of Allington also went to Symondsbury.

== Geography ==

Bridport is in the county of Dorset in South West England. Measured directly, it is about west of the county town Dorchester, SSW of Yeovil in Somerset, east of Exeter in Devon and inland from the English Channel at West Bay. The town centre is sited between the small River Brit and its tributary the Asker, about north of their confluence, at an altitude of . Another small tributary, the River Simene, also joins the Brit to the west of the town centre.

Bridport contains several neighbourhoods, some of which used to be separate villages. These include Allington, Skilling, Coneygar, Bothenhampton, Bradpole, Court Orchard and St Andrew&#x27;s Well. South of the town centre and within the town&#x27;s boundary is West Bay, a small fishing harbour known as Bridport Harbour until the arrival of the railway.

The geology of Bridport comprises rocks formed in the Pliensbachian, Toarcian, Aalenian, Bajocian, Bathonian and Callovian ages of the Jurassic Period, overlain by superficial Quaternary deposits of alluvium alongside the rivers. There are several faults in the area, including the Mangerton Fault, which is aligned SSW-NNE and runs from West Bay up the valleys of the River Brit and Mangerton River. This intersects with several E-W faults, including three in the lower Brit Valley, between Bothenhampton and West Bay, that run east, and two, north of the town centre, that run west. The land beneath the town centre and to the west and southwest (around the neighbourhood of Skilling) is mostly Eype Clay, a micaceous mudstone, though slightly younger Down Cliff Sand crowns the hill at Watton Cross. The hills immediately north of the town are formed from Bridport Sand, with Allington Hill and Watton Hill having small caps of Inferior Oolite. North of the hills, moving away from the town&#x27;s built-up area, undifferentiated Down Cliff Sand and Thorncombe Sand is separated from the Bridport Sand of the hills in most places by a band of Beacon Limestone. The hills east of the town, around Walditch and Loders, are also mostly of Bridport Sand capped by Inferior Oolite, with the Beacon Limestone outcropping near their base and the undifferentiated sands closer to the town. To the south east however, the faults running east from the lower Brit Valley are associated with a change to slightly younger material, mostly calcareous mudstones and sandstones (Fuller&#x27;s Earth, Frome Clay and Forest Marble), with small outcrops of Cornbrash limestone and Kellaways Formation to the south of Bothenhampton parish church.

The coast at Bridport is part of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site that covers a continuous of coastline in Dorset and neighbouring east Devon. Chesil beach starts at Portland and ends at West Bay. The east pier of West Bay is at the east end of Chesil beach. All of the town is also within the Dorset National Landscape area, a protected landscape designation of national significance. The town&#x27;s most notable landmark is the conical Colmers Hill, its distinctive shape and small clump of summit trees being very noticeable from West Street.

Bridport is a Met Office coastal weather observation point.

== Demography ==
In the 2011 census the population of the built-up area of Bridport was 13,568. The 2012 mid-year estimate of the population of Bridport&#x27;s built-up area is 14,697.

According to council tax records, in 2014 the proportion of homes within Bridport&#x27;s built-up area that were second homes was 4.8%. The figure for Bridport parish alone was 5.6%.

== Economy ==

Writing in 1965, Ralph Wightman stated that &quot;in the best possible meaning of the word Bridport has always been an industrial town, and its industries always had a connection with the countryside and the sea [...] Bridport has not had any industrial revolution. It has not blasted the countryside, and it has escaped the worst depressions. Perhaps this accounts for the fact that it has always been famous for good food and drink&quot;.

In 2012 there were 4,900 people employed in Bridport, 59% of whom were employed full-time and 41% part-time.

== Culture, art and media ==
In the 21st century, Bridport&#x27;s arts scene has contributed to the town becoming increasingly popular with people from outside the locality. It has an arts centre, theatre, library, cinema and museum, and several annual events.
Bridport Arts Centre originated in the early 1970s when local activists bought an old Wesleyan chapel and adjacent schoolroom on South Street and converted them into a theatre and art gallery—named the Allsop Gallery in memory of broadcaster and local resident Kenneth Allsop. The centre hosts a diverse programme of cultural events and since the 1990s has received funding from the Arts Council. In 1973 the centre founded the Bridport Prize, an annual international poetry and short story competition described by its patron Fay Weldon as &quot;a prize really worth fighting for in terms of prestige and genuine literary accomplishment&quot;.
The Electric Palace Cinema has occupied its existing site since 1926. It closed down in 1999 but an ensuing campaign to &#x27;Save the Palace&#x27; resulted in the building being listed before being bought by a new owner and refurbished to include a digital projector, auditorium murals, a new restaurant and art deco bar. It reopened in 2007 and in March 2009 hosted the world premiere of &quot;The Young Victoria&quot;.

The Lyric Theatre, which reopened in 2010, hosts quirky theatre, puppetry, comedy, clowning and music. It is also the base of children&#x27;s theatre company Stuff and Nonsense. Bridport Museum, located in South Street, includes an extensive exhibition of the town&#x27;s long history of rope-making.

Bridport features as &#x27;Port Bredy&#x27; in the fictional &#x27;Wessex&#x27; of Thomas Hardy&#x27;s novels, and is the setting for Eden Phillpotts&#x27; 1918 novel &quot;The Spinners&quot;. Frederick Harcourt Kitchin, under the pseudonym Bennet Copplestone, used the area in his 1922 novel &quot;The Treasure of Golden Cap&quot;.

=== Events ===
Bridport holds a number of festivals. The Bridport Literary Festival has been running since 2005 and has played host to literary figures such as Elizabeth Jane Howard, Victoria Glendinning, Minette Walters and Fay Weldon. Bridport Food Festival is held in late June at Asker Meadow. It showcases locally produced foods for which the area is well known. The Food Festival week concludes with the Round Table Beer Festival. Since 2010, there has been an annual Hat Festival which takes place in &#x27;Bucky Doo Square&#x27; for a weekend every September. An annual Christmas Tree Festival is held every December in the United Church. Over sixty trees are decorated by local and national charities, with visitors able to make donations.

Bridport holds an annual carnival on the third Saturday in August. The main feature is a carnival parade of floats, walking acts and majorettes, with other attractions including a car boot sale, fete and funfair. After the carnival South Street is closed for the night as live music is played while people dance in the street. The funfair is also open late. On the following night a torchlight procession takes place, with 1,500 torches carried 2 miles from the town centre to a bonfire at West Bay. This is followed by live music and fireworks. West Bay&#x27;s funfair opens until late. The events raise money for local good causes and organisations.

Melplash Show, described by its organisers as &quot;the South West’s premier agricultural exhibition&quot;, is held annually on the showground at West Bay on the Thursday before the August Bank Holiday weekend.

Local artists in Bridport and the surrounding area open up their studios as part of Bridport Open Studios, which marked its 15th year in 2013. The event takes place over the three days of the August Bank Holiday weekend and over 100 artists participate. The popularity of the event has led to three more open events in November, Easter and May. The biggest artist led venue is the St Michael&#x27;s Studio complex on the St Michael&#x27;s Trading Estate. It provides studios for 25 artists and attracted over 700 visitors to the 2009 event.

Other one-day events include the West Bay Wallow, a charity swim event in which participants often wear fancy dress, organised by the Bridport Round Table on Boxing Day, and a raft race in the River Brit basin, also at West Bay, in July; it is organised by the RNLI and participants race in homemade rafts and usually wear fancy dress. It has been run for over forty years and attracts thousands of spectators, with money raised for the RNLI.

=== Media ===
Bridport has one local weekly newspaper, the &quot;Bridport News&quot;, owned by Newsquest and published on Thursdays. The &quot;Dorset Echo&quot; also serves Bridport.

Bridport receives &quot;BBC Spotlight&quot; and ITV West Country television, transmitted in digital from the Stockland Hill Transmitter and a digital relay transmitter based at Highlands End. Local radio includes Greatest Hits Radio and BBC Radio Solent.

Bridport has one community website, Bridport Radio, which uses a newspaper style format. It mixes local information with comedic made-up news stories. The site allows users to comment on local subjects.

=== Filming location ===
Bridport and the surrounding area was used to film Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall&#x27;s Channel 4 television programme &quot;River Cottage&quot; and the BBC dramas &quot;Harbour Lights&quot; starring Nick Berry and &quot;Rockliffe&#x27;s Folly&quot; starring Ian Hogg. West Bay was used to film the 1950s film &quot;The Navy Lark&quot; (based on the radio series of the same name), the opening credits of &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot;, and much of the filming of the crime drama &quot;Broadchurch&quot;, starring David Tennant and Olivia Colman, and was written by Chris Chibnall who lives in Bridport.

== Transport ==
The A35 trunk road between Honiton and Southampton passes around the centre of Bridport on a bypass. Routes which start in the town include the A3066, which heads north through Beaminster towards Crewkerne, and the B3157 coast road to Weymouth. The busiest main route in the Bridport area is the A35 west of the town at Miles Cross, which in 2012 had an average of 15,200 vehicles per day – this was an 85% increase over vehicle numbers in 1983, but a 3% decrease compared to 2007. Other main routes around the town have experienced similar changes. Bridport is quite some distance from the UK motorway network with the nearest motorway access at junction 25 of the M5 at Taunton, 32 miles (51 km) away via the B3162 and A358 roads.

Bridport railway station was closed in May 1975, along with the Bridport – Maiden Newton branch line. The nearest railway stations to Bridport are Maiden Newton on the Heart of Wessex Line, Crewkerne on the West of England Main Line, and Dorchester South on the South West Main Line. There is a bus service (X51) linking the railway stations in Axminster, Dorchester and Weymouth, and another (X53) between Axminster and Weymouth via Bridport. There are a few buses a day northwards to Beaminster, Crewkerne and Yeovil, although travelling beyond Beaminster often involves a change. In 2017 Dorset County Council cut all rural bus subsidies in the area and so most of the surrounding villages are not served by scheduled services, with the exception of buses provided mainly for school transport but upon which the public is allowed to travel.

The nearest port with scheduled passenger services is Poole. The nearest international airports are Exeter and Bournemouth.
== Education ==
Primary schools in Bridport are Bridport Primary School, St Mary&#x27;s CE VC Primary School, St Catherine&#x27;s RC Primary School and Symondsbury CE VC Primary School.

The sixth form is combined with Beaminster School in nearby Beaminster. Children also attend other secondary schools within the region: The Woodroffe School in Lyme Regis, Colyton Grammar School in east Devon, and the Thomas Hardye School in Dorchester. There are daily buses running to these schools from Bridport. Further and higher education in the region is provided by Yeovil College, Weymouth College, Kingston Maurward College and Bournemouth University.

== Religion ==
St Mary&#x27;s Church was founded in the 13th century though much of it dates from the 15th century and it was substantially restored and altered in the 19th century. There is a 17th-century brass in St. Catherine&#x27;s Chapel that commemorates Edward Coker who was killed in 1685 during the Monmouth Rebellion. There is a strong connection with the Bridport United Church (Methodist/URC) and the two hold joint services, study groups and children&#x27;s holiday clubs. The parish is linked with Roumois in the Diocese of Évreux, Normandy. The church has a maximum capacity of 400 and hosts many events. It has a peal of eight bells.

Opposite the church is a Society of Friends Meeting House. There has been a Quaker presence in the town since the middle of the 17th century. George Fox visited the Friends in the town in 1655 and said, &quot;A fine Meeting there is there.&quot; The Bridport Quaker Meeting still meets for worship on Sunday and Wednesday mornings.

Bridport has a history of nonconformism; a Dissenters&#x27; Academy was built in the town in 1768, and by 1865 the single Anglican church, St Mary&#x27;s, was outnumbered by non-Church-of-England establishments by seven to one. The Wesleyan chapel on South Street, now the Bridport Arts Centre, is a Grade II listed building; it was erected in 1838, designed by James Wilson of Bath, Somerset, and built by Charles and Joseph Galpin of Bridport.
The Unitarian &quot;Chapel in the Garden&quot;, on the north side of East Street, provides a neutral development resource for an open faith community.

Water Polo matches are held in summer in the outer harbour at West Bay, continuing a tradition dating back to 1898. The area also hosts a real tennis court, one of 27 in the UK. Hyde court, near the village of Walditch, was renovated and re-opened in 1998 with the aid of a lottery grant. Bowling is represented by Bridport Bowling Club, in Priory Lane (flat green outdoors in summer and short mat in winter), and Bridport Indoor Bowling Club in Shoe Lane.

<text>Hexham ( ) is a market town and civil parish in Northumberland, England, on the south bank of the River Tyne, formed by the confluence of the North Tyne and the South Tyne at Warden nearby, and close to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. Hexham was the administrative centre for the Tynedale district from 1974 to 2009. In 2011, it had a population of 13,097.

Smaller towns and villages around Hexham include Corbridge, Riding Mill, Stocksfield and Wylam to the east, Acomb and Bellingham to the north, Allendale to the south and Haydon Bridge, Bardon Mill and Haltwhistle to the west. Newcastle upon Tyne is to the east and Carlisle to the west.

==Toponym==
The name Hexham derives from the Old English &quot;Hagustaldes ea&quot; and later &quot;Hagustaldes ham&quot; from which the modern form (with the &quot;-ham&quot; element) derives. &quot;Hagustald&quot; is related to the Old High German &quot;hagustalt&quot;, denoting a younger son who takes land outside the settlement; the element &quot;ea&quot; means &quot;stream&quot; or &quot;river&quot; and &quot;ham&quot; is the Old English form of the Modern English &quot;home&quot; (and the Scots and Northern English &quot;hame&quot;).

== History ==
Hexham Abbey originated as a monastery founded by Wilfrid in 674. The crypt of the original monastery survives, and incorporates many stones taken from nearby Roman ruins, probably Corbridge or Hadrian&#x27;s Wall.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; (Manuscript D: Cotton Tiberius B IV) records the murder of King Ælfwald by Sicga at &quot;Scythlecester&quot; (which may be modern Chesters) on 23 September 788:
This year Alfwald, king of the Northumbrians, was slain by Siga, on the ninth day before the calends of October; and a heavenly light was often seen on the spot where he was slain. He was buried at Hexham in the church.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Her wæs Alfwald Norðhymbra cyning ofslægen fram Sigan on .viiii. Kalendas Octobris, 7 heofonlic leoht wæs lome gesewen þær þær he ofslægen wæs, 7 he wæs bebyrged on Hagustaldesee innan þære cyrican.&quot;

Like many towns in the Anglo-Scottish border area and adjacent regions, Hexham suffered from the border wars between the kingdoms of Scotland and England, including attacks from William Wallace who burnt the town in 1297. In 1312, Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland, demanded and received £2000 from the town and monastery in order for them to be spared a similar fate. In 1346 the monastery was sacked in a later invasion led by King David II of Scotland.

In 1464, during the Wars of the Roses, the Battle of Hexham was fought somewhere to the south of the town; the actual site is disputed. The defeated Lancastrian commander, Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset, was executed in Hexham marketplace. There is a legend that Queen Margaret of Anjou took refuge after the battle in what is known as The Queen&#x27;s Cave, where she was accosted by a robber; the legend formed the basis for an 18th-century play by George Colman the Younger (&quot;The Battle of Hexham&quot;); but it has been established that Queen Margaret had fled to France by the time the battle took place. The Queen&#x27;s Cave in question is on the south side of the West Dipton Burn, to the southwest of Hexham.

Until 1572, Hexham was the administrative centre of the former Liberty or Peculiar of Hexhamshire.

In 1715, James Radclyffe, 3rd Earl of Derwentwater, raised the standard for James Francis Edward Stuart in Hexham Market place.

&quot;Hexham&quot; was used in the Borders as a euphemism for &quot;Hell&quot;. Hence the term &quot;To Hexham wi&#x27; you an&#x27; ye’r whussel!&quot;, recorded in 1873, and the popular expression &quot;Gang to Hexham!&quot;. &quot;Hexham-birnie&quot; is derived from the term and means &quot;an indefinitely remote place&quot;.

===Hexham riot===
In 1761, the Hexham Riot took place in the Market Place when a crowd protesting about changes in the criteria for serving in the militia were fired upon by troops from the North York Militia. Some 45 protesters were killed, earning the Militia the sobriquet of The Hexham Butchers.

== Notable buildings ==
Hexham&#x27;s architectural landscape is dominated by Hexham Abbey. The current church largely dates from c. 1170–1250, in the Early English Gothic style of architecture. The choir, north and south transepts and the cloisters, where canons studied and meditated, date from this period.

The abbey stands at the west end of the market place, which is home to the Shambles, a covered market built by Sir Walter Blackett in 1766; it is a Grade II* listed building.

At the east end of the market place stands the Moot Hall, originally commissioned as a gatehouse that was part of the defences of the town. The Moot Hall, which is considered one of the best examples of a medieval courthouse in the north of England, is a Grade I listed building.

The Old Gaol, behind the Moot Hall on Hallgates, was one of the first purpose-built jails in England. It was built between 1330 and 1333 and is a Grade I listed building.

The Leazes on Shaws Lane is a Grade II listed mansion built in 1853 by John Dobson for William Kinsopp.
Hexham Library and the Queen&#x27;s Hall Art Centre can both be found in the Queen&#x27;s Hall, completed in 1866. The building contains the Brough Local Studies Collection which is the second-largest local history collection in the county.

Dare Wilson Barracks, the home of X Company, 5th Battalion, The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was completed in 1891.

The Hexham Courant is the local newspaper, serving Hexham and Tynedale since 1864. It was first launched by J. Catherall &amp; Co., and at that time espoused the Liberal cause. It later absorbed the Conservative-supporting &quot;Hexham Herald&quot;. In 1977, CN Group acquired the newspaper.

== Economy ==
The major employer in Hexham is Austrian firm Egger.

Hexham had been long famous for its manufacture of leather. Wright (1823) gives some statistics77 men &amp; boys employed as Leather dressers and Glove-cutters, 40 boys employed as Dusters and 1,111 women employed as Sewers. Skins dressed annually were 80,000, and 18,000 skins of dressed leather were imported. From these were made and exported annually 23,504 dozens of pairs of gloves. Dutch Oker was used in the processing, but local fell clay could be used if necessary.Tanning was a necessary allied industry and there were four tanneries, employing a score of men. In a year they dealt with 5,000 hides and 12,000 calf skins. They supplied local saddlers, bootmakers and cobblers.
Hexham also had 16 master hatters, and the trade employed 40 persons. There were two woollen manufactories, worked by steam power, and two rope manufactories. There were corn water mills below the bridge. A windmill on the Sele was ruinous, but there was one still working on Tyne Green. It was, and still is a flourishing market, including a mart for cattle and other farm animals.

In Hexham the Subskimmer was designed and made by Submarine Products.

Botanical brewery Fentimans is based in Hexham.

== Sport ==
Hexham&#x27;s racecourse is at Yarridge Heights in the hills above the town, with National Hunt (steeplechase) races throughout the year.

<text>Horncastle is a market town and civil parish in the East Lindsey district in Lincolnshire, England. It is east of Lincoln. Its population was 6,815 at the 2011 census and estimated at 7,123 in 2019. A section of the ancient Roman walls remains.

==History==
===Romans===
Although fortified, Horncastle was not on any important Roman roads, which suggests that the River Bain was the principal route of access to it.

Roman Horncastle has become known recently as &quot;Banovallum&quot; (i. e. Wall on the River Bain). Although this Roman name has been adopted by some local businesses and the town&#x27;s secondary modern school, it is not firmly known to be original. &quot;Banovallum&quot; was merely suggested in the 19th century through an interpretation of the &quot;Ravenna Cosmography&quot;, a 7th-century list of Roman towns and road-stations, and may equally have meant Caistor.

The place-name ‘Horncastle’ is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as ‘Hornecastre’. It appears as ‘Hornecastra’ in the Pipe Rolls of 1130. The name means “the Roman fort in the tongue of land” between the River Bain and River Waring.

The Roman walls remain in places. One section is on display in the town&#x27;s library, which was built over the top of the wall. The Saxons called the town &quot;Hyrnecastre&quot;, from which its modern name derives.

===Domesday Book===
Horncastle is listed in the 1086 &quot;Domesday Book&quot; with 41 households, including 29 villagers and twelve smallholders, and had of meadow and two mills, all belonging to King William.

===Church===

Dating from the 13th century, well before the Reformation, the Anglican parish church is dedicated to St Mary the Virgin. It is a Grade II* listed building in the Early English style, but was extensively restored 1859–1861 by Ewan Christian.

===English Civil War===
Four miles out is the village of Winceby, where in 1643 the Battle of Winceby helped to gain Lincolnshire for Parliament, although its leader, Oliver Cromwell, was almost killed. Local legend has it that the 13 scythe blades hanging on the wall of the south chapel of St Mary&#x27;s Church were used as weapons at Winceby, but this is mainly seen as apocryphal. The historical opinion is that they probably date from the Lincolnshire Rising of 1536. Both theories on the scythes appear in the &quot;Church History&quot; Lincoln website.

===Blood sports===
Horncastle was once a centre for cockfighting and bull-baiting. &quot;The Fighting Cocks&quot; remains the name of a local pub. Bull-baiting was practised in the area known as the Bull Ring. One historian finds that the practise continued until about 1810. Both these sports were banned in England and Wales under the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835.

===Market and horse fair===

Horncastle gained a Crown market charter in the 13th century. It was long known for its great August horse fair, a famous trading event that continued until the mid-20th century. It ended after the Second World War, when horses had largely ceased to be used on farms. The town remains a centre of the antiques trade.

The annual horse fair was probably first held in the 13th century. It would last for a week or more every August. In the 19th century it was probably the largest such event in the United Kingdom. The slogan, &quot;Horncastle for horses&quot;, was a sign of the town&#x27;s standing in this trade. The fair was George Borrow&#x27;s setting for some scenes in his semi-autobiographical books &quot;Lavengro&quot; and &quot;The Romany Rye&quot;. The last was held in 1948. Livestock markets continued for pigs and cattle, the last cattle market being held in 2000.

In 1894 the Stanhope Memorial, designed by E. Lingen Barker, was raised in the centre of the Market Place in memory of Edward Stanhope MP. It is a Grade II listed structure made of limestone, red sandstone and pink and grey streaked marble.

===Notable buildings===
The Grade II listed Old Court House in Louth Road was built in 1865. There are 116 other listed edifices in the town, including the three places of worship – St Mary&#x27;s (Grade II*), Holy Trinity (Grade II) and the Congregational Church (Grade II) – and several sections of the Roman walls (Grade I). The former Horncastle Town Hall was built as a drill hall and completed in around 1903.

The Sir Joseph Banks Centre commemorates the botanist who sailed with Captain Cook on &quot;HMS Endeavour&quot;. Banks, who lived at nearby Revesby Abbey, contributed to botanical science, with around 80 plant species bearing his name, and helped establish Kew Gardens as a leading institution. 

==Population==
Historically, the civil parish lost population from the mid-19th to mid-20th centuries, as urbanisation and agricultural changes drew people to cities, where more work was available. However, the population since the late 20th century it has risen, to 6,815 in 2011, its highest so far. The estimated population in 2019 was still higher at 7,123.

==Geography==
Horncastle lies 7 miles from Woodhall Spa, 18 miles from Boston, 21 miles from Lincoln and 13 miles from Louth. It is near the main A158 road between Lincoln to Skegness, to the south of the Lincolnshire Wolds, where the north–south River Bain meets the River Waring from the east, and north of the West and Wildmore Fens. The south of Horncastle is called Cagthorpe. Langton Hill to the west was part of Horncastle Rural District in the Parts of Lindsey, but is now in the district of East Lindsey, based in Manby.

North of Horncastle are the villages of West Ashby and Low Toynton, and to their south Milestone House and Mareham on the Hill on the eastern outskirts. The Viking Way meets the River Waring, then north of the A158 the village of High Toynton. The A153 skirts the southern edge of the River Bain to reach Roughton and Thornton. The border follows the Old River Bain west of the A153 and north over the river meadows, crossing the Horncastle Canal and Viking Way. Eastwards it crosses the B1191 to the village of Langton and northwards to Thimbleby. It meets the B1190, then the A158 at the B1190 junction, following Accommodation Road to the east and skirting the north of the town along Elmhurst Road, past Elmhurst Lakes, to reach West Ashby at the River Bain near Hemingby Lane.

== Demographics ==
At the 2021 census, Horncastle&#x27;s built up area had a population of 7,291. Of the findings, the ethnicity and religious composition of the ward was:

The religious composition of the ward at the 2021 Census was recorded as:

Lincolnshire Integrated Voluntary Emergency Service is based at the Boston Road Industrial Estate. The Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust is based in Banovallum House. Mortons of Horncastle is a major national magazine publisher of classic motorcycles, aviation and road transport heritage titles, based in the industrial estate off the A153 (Boston Road).

==Governance==
An electoral ward of the same name exists. It includes Thimbleby and had a total population at the 2011 Census of 7,073.

==Politics==
Horncastle has always been a safe area for the Conservative Party, except for two years in the early 1920s, when it had Liberal Party representation. It had an eponymous parliamentary constituency for 98 years, from 1885 to 1983. It then became Gainsborough and Horncastle, and after 1997 Louth and Horncastle. Henry Haslam served as MP in the Second World War and the five years of the Churchill wartime government. The veteran politician Sir Peter Tapsell was MP for the town in 1966–1983 and 1997–2015, being Father of the House of Commons from 2010 to 2015. After a redistribution of parliamentary constituencies, Edward Leigh was MP from 1983–1997. In 2024 Victoria Atkins was re-elected as the Conservative MP for Louth and Horncastle.

==Education==
===Primary schooling===
Horncastle Primary School stands in Bowl Alley Lane.

===Secondary schooling===
Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Grammar School was founded in 1571, and is among the top schools in Lincolnshire, having been at times among the top schools in the country. Its tennis, hockey, netball and cricket teams compete regionally, and the tennis team was a regional winner in the 2005 British Schools Tennis Championships. Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s is a specialist Science College and Language College. Its Design and Technology department recently entered two teams in the National 4X4 for Schools engineering competition, one of which came first nationally in its age group, while the other came second nationally overall.

The Banovallum School is a non-selective community school serving Horncastle and surrounding villages; it forms a science specialist school jointly with Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Grammar School. The most recent Ofsted inspection in 2019 judged the school to be overall Grade 2 (good). It had a building added in 2010, with facilities for cookery, woodwork, metalwork, art and music.

St Lawrence School is a special-needs school with a county-wide intake. It comprises the Lincolnshire Wolds Federation with St Bernard&#x27;s School, Louth.

===Colleges===
Horncastle College was a &quot;lifelong-learning&quot; adult education college that ran short and residential courses in I.T., art, languages and local history. It has been replaced by Fortuna Horncastle Business Centre.

==Transport==
===Roads===

Horncastle sits at the crossroads of two major Lincolnshire roads: the east–west A158, joining the county town of Lincoln with the resort of Skegness on the Lincolnshire coast, and the north–south A153 joining Louth with Sleaford and Grantham in the south. These meet at the Bull Ring in central Horncastle.

The A158 through Horncastle becomes busy in the summer holidays with Skegness holidaymakers. To alleviate traffic pressure in the town centre a relief road, Jubilee Way, was built in the 1970s. Minor roads run from Horncastle to Bardney, Boston (via Revesby), Fulletby and Woodhall Spa.

Horncastle is a hub for the InterConnect rural bus service. Regular services run to Lincoln, Skegness and across the Wolds. The Viking Way long-distance footpath passes through the town.

===Railway===
The Great Northern Railway&#x27;s Lincoln–Boston line ran through Kirkstead, from Horncastle, and a branch line from Kirkstead (later Woodhall Junction) through Woodhall Spa to Horncastle opened on 11 August 1855. The last passenger service ran in 1954, with complete closure to goods traffic in 1971. Horncastle railway station was demolished in the 1980s and replaced by housing. The nearest railway station now is Metheringham () on the Peterborough to Lincoln Line. Part of the old railway is followed by the Viking Way footpath.

===Waterways===

Horncastle Canal, based on the River Bain, was begun in 1792 and opened in 1802. In 2004 it was suggested that the canal be renovated with the help of private capital and promoted as a route for pleasure craft, as has been done successfully in other areas. A local kick-start programme raised money for the project.

== Media ==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Belmont TV transmitter. BBC East Midlands and ITV Central can also be received from the Waltham TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Lincolnshire on 94.9 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Lincolnshire on 102.2 FM, Hits Radio Lincolnshire, which broadcasts on DAB and County Linx Radio that broadcast online. 

The Horncastle News is the town’s weekly local newspaper.

==Sport==
===Field games===
Horncastle Town FC, founded in 1873, is an amateur club based at The Wong. It joined the Lincolnshire Football League in the 1996/1997 season.

The town&#x27;s cricket club at Coronation Walk has two men&#x27;s and five youth teams.

Horncastle Hockey Club is a voluntary field-hockey body set up in November 1970 at Coronation Walk, Horncastle. In 2020 it had two men&#x27;s and two women&#x27;s teams and a junior section.

===Court games===
Horncastle and District Tennis Club has served for over 70 years. Initially on grass courts in Stanhope Road, the club moved to the current Coronation Walk location in the 1970s.

Horncastle Community Members Squash Club in Hemmingby Lane was founded in November 2006 to preserve an existing club by buying out retiring owners who had run it for 25 years.

==Floods==

The town has been susceptible to flooding, notably in 1920 and 1960, and with three floods between 1981 and 1984.

Folk belief associates the occurrence of floods with installations of new vicars in Horncastle&#x27;s Anglican Church. The vicar changed in 1919 and 1959, both less than a year before a flood. The flooding of the early 1980s was attributed to the change of vicar in 1980, but there was no flooding after the change of vicar in 1999. The River Bain and River Waring overflowed during the 2007 United Kingdom floods.

Flooding recurred in 2012. A £15 million, 30-year-old proposed flood-defence scheme was seen as unlikely to have prevented the 2012 flood, but new flood defences are being discussed. An anti-flood pump was installed in 2013.

On 7 October 1960 Horncastle entered the UK Weather Records with a &quot;highest 180-minute total&quot; rainfall of 178 mm. Water levels are said to have risen as a consequence.

Real-time river levels are available from the Environment Agency:
*River Bain at Horncastle Victoria Mill
*River Waring at Horncastle&#x27;s Banks Road

Flood warnings for the town:
*Watermill Road, Bridge Street, St. Lawrence Street, Prospect Street and West Street areas
*Stanhope Road, Banks Road, East Street, North Street, Wharf Road and Waring Street areas

==Twin town==
Horncastle is twinned with Bonnétable, a &quot;ville de marché&quot; (market town) in the French department of Sarthe, with a population of about 4,000. The towns&#x27; relationship is commemorated by a &quot;Rue Horncastle&quot; in Bonnétable and a Bonnetable Road in Horncastle (without the acute accent).

<text>Robert Creel Davis (November 6, 1949 – September 8, 1991), known professionally as Brad Davis, was an American actor. For his debut film role as Billy Hayes in the 1978 film &quot;Midnight Express,&quot; he won the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor and was nominated for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, along with BAFTA Award nominations for Best Actor in a Leading Role and Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles.

Davis subsequently played the title role in the Rainer Werner Fassbinder film &quot;Querelle&quot; (1982), and appeared in such films as &quot;A Small Circle of Friends&quot; (1980), &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; (1981), and &quot;Cold Steel&quot; (1987). He also starred in television films and miniseries.

Davis, who struggled with substance abuse issues throughout his adult life, was diagnosed with HIV in 1985 and died of AIDS-related illness in 1991.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
He was born in Tallahassee, Florida, to Eugene Davis, a dentist whose career declined due to alcoholism, and his wife, Anne (née Creel) Davis. His brother Gene is also an actor. Davis was known as Bobby during his youth, but took Brad as his stage name in 1973. He attended and graduated from Titusville High School.

According to a 1997 &quot;New York Times&quot; interview with his widow Susan Bluestein, Davis suffered physical abuse from his father and sexual abuse from his mother. As an adult, Davis was an alcoholic and an intravenous drug user, then became sober in 1981. Davis was bisexual.

=== Early acting roles ===
At 16, after winning a music-talent contest, Davis worked at Theater Atlanta. He later moved to New York City and attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, and the American Place Theater where he studied acting. After a role on the soap opera &quot;How to Survive a Marriage&quot;, he performed in Off-Broadway plays.

In 1976, he was cast in the television mini-series &quot;Roots&quot;, then as Sally Field&#x27;s love interest in the television film &quot;Sybil&quot;. The same year, he married casting director Susan Bluestein. They would have one child together, Alex Blue Davis (b. 1983), a musician and actor.

In 1977, he was cast as John Rambo in &quot;First Blood&quot; when John Frankenheimer was scheduled to direct the film before it was cancelled due to Orion Pictures&#x27; acquisition of Filmways.

=== &quot;Midnight Express&quot; and stardom ===
His most successful film role was as the main character Billy Hayes in &quot;Midnight Express&quot; (1978), for which he won the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture Acting Debut – Actor. He was nominated for a similar award at that year&#x27;s BAFTA Awards, in addition to receiving Best Actor nominations at both ceremonies (Richard Dreyfuss won for &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot;).

In 1980, Davis would play war correspondent Phil Caputo in the biographical made-for-television film &quot;A Rumor of War&quot;. The same year, he would be top-billed for his role in the film &quot;A Small Circle of Friends&quot;.

In 1981, he played American track star Jackson Scholz in the Academy Award-winning film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;.

In 1982, Davis played the title role of Georges Querelle in the film film &quot;Querelle,&quot; Rainer Werner Fassbinder&#x27;s final film before his death by a drug overdose.

=== Supporting roles and television films ===
Davis played the lead role of Ned Weeks in &quot;The Normal Heart&quot; (1985), Larry Kramer&#x27;s play about AIDS.

While continuing to play supporting roles in theatrical films, Davis appeared regularly in made-for-television films, including &quot;Chiefs&quot;, &quot;Robert Kennedy &amp; His Times, The Rainbow Warrior Conspiracy&quot;, and &quot;The Plot to Kill Hitler.&quot; He played Queeg in a 1988 television adaptation of &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial&quot;, directed by Robert Altman, opposite Eric Bogosian and Jeff Daniels.

== Illness and death ==
Diagnosed with HIV in 1985, Davis kept his condition private until shortly before his death at age 41 on September 8, 1991, in Los Angeles. In 1997, his wife Susan revealed that he probably contracted HIV through intravenous drug use, and that he committed assisted suicide by a drug overdose. It was revealed in a book proposal that Davis had written before his death that he had to keep his HIV-positive status a secret to be able to continue to work and support his family.

He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills.

<text>Hornsea is a seaside town and civil parish in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. The settlement dates to at least the early medieval period. The town was expanded in the Victorian era with the coming of the Hull and Hornsea Railway in 1864. In the First World War, the mere was briefly the site of RNAS Hornsea Mere, a seaplane base. During the Second World War, the town and beach were heavily fortified against invasion.

The civil parish encompasses Hornsea town; the natural lake, Hornsea Mere; and the lost or deserted villages of Hornsea Beck, Northorpe and Southorpe. Structures of note in the parish include the medieval parish church of St Nicholas, Bettison&#x27;s Folly, Hornsea Mere and the sea front promenade.

The economy includes a mix of tourism and small manufacturing. Most notably, Hornsea Pottery was established in Hornsea in 1949 and closed in 2000. Modern Hornsea still functions as a coastal resort and has large caravan sites to the north and south.

The soft soil and low-lying geography result in consistent coastal erosion that threatens some of the infrastructure of the community. This is expected to worsen as climate change causes sea level rise. In some areas, residents have already been forced to take a managed retreat.

== Etymology and name ==
The name &quot;Hornsea&quot; likely derives from the Old Norse elements &quot;horn&quot; (&quot;horn&quot;), &quot;nes&quot; (&quot;headland, promontory&quot;) and &quot;sæ&quot; (&quot;sea, lake&quot;).

Hornsea may have been the site of Cornu Vallis, a place-name derived from Brittonic &quot;corno&quot; (&quot;horn&quot;)

==Geography==
The civil parish of Hornsea is located on the Holderness coast approximately north-east of Hull. The parish is bounded by the civil parishes of Atwick to the north, Seaton to the west, Hatfield and Mappleton to the south, and by the North Sea to the east. The civil parish contains the coastal town of Hornsea, and a suburb of &quot;Hornsea Bridge&quot; or &quot;Hornsea Burton&quot; south of the former railway line, as well as Hornsea Mere. Excluding the town and its suburbs there are no other habitations of note in the parish, except some farms. The remainder of the parish is low lying farm land divided into fields.

Most of the civil parish lies at between above sea level, with the highest points in the parish under . The B1242 road runs north to south parallel with the coast through the parish and the A1035 runs westward connecting with the A165 near Leven. Additionally a foot and cycle path, the Hornsea Rail Trail, part of the Trans Pennine Trail runs south-west from the town centre towards Hull.

Hornsea Mere is a lake of around with an outflow towards the sea by the Stream Dike Drain. This drain also separates Hornsea from the Hornsea Bridge suburb.

According to the 2011 UK census, Hornsea parish had a population of 8,432. Hornsea is in the Parliamentary constituency of Beverley and Holderness.

===Geology and erosion ===

The underlying geology is primarily boulder clay. High points in the area are formed of gravel. (See &quot;moraine&quot;.) The topsoils are fine and loamy, whilst the rock beneath the boulder clay is classed as Flamborough Chalk from the Upper Cretaceous period. Historically large stones in the boulder clay were removed for use in road construction – this activity had been prohibited at Hornsea by the board of trade by 1885. Sands and clays were also used locally in building (), though better quality materials were found elsewhere.

Some early writers (William Camden 1551–1623) thought that ground conditions in the area were evidence of an earthquake, whilst supposed the Mere and fossil finds to be evidence of a great flood or deluge in the area. Since at least the late 19th century the geological conditions overlying the underlying chalk have been interpreted as being from a glacial process in origin – both the boulder clay and the gravel beds and moraines.

Borings suggest the chalk probably lies at around under the sand, gravel and clay beds at Hornsea, though possibly deeper. Water in Hornsea has been obtained from wells and bore holes, though some borings have yielded water contaminated with iron, whilst others failed to reach an aquifer even at a depth of .

The Mere is the last of many lakes in the Holderness area – the remainder had been drained by the late 19th century. At the sea remains of a submarine forest were found in a bed of peat found around halfway between cliff and lower water. The trees found were oak, alder and willow. A variety of fossils have been found in the deposits, including those of the extinct Eurasian cave lion (&quot;Felis spelaea&quot;), Woolly Mammoth (&quot;Elephas primigenius&quot;), Aurochs (&quot;Bos primigenius&quot;) as well as Red Deer (&quot;Cervus elaphus&quot;) and Horse species (&quot;Equus&quot;). Molluscs found in the subterranean gravel appear to have been freshwater species. It is thought the source of the submarine forests recorded on the coast at Hornsea may have been a second mere on the eastern side of the present lake which was silted and was lost to the sea at some point.

The coast at Hornsea is subject to erosion. The rate of erosion varies, but has been inferred at around per year in the latter part of the 16th century; estimated by George Poulson at per year in the late 18th century, though recorded at up to in some years in the same period. The rate of erosion may have been influenced by the presence or absence of erosion limiting groynes or a pier. South, at Hornsea Burton, erosion rates rose from pa between the periods 1845–76 and 1876–82, thought to be due to the construction of groynes north of the beach at Hornsea. The current (2008) rate of erosion is north of and south of Hornsea – the difference due to the defences at Hornsea preventing the renewing flow of sediment southwards.

An apocryphal inscription said to have been found in Hornsea references the nearing of the sea by erosion – the figure of ten miles given as the distance the town once stood from the sea is certainly artistic licence.

===Hornsea town===

The old town of Hornsea is centred on the Market Place, and includes Southgate, Westgate and Mere Side; the resort and promenade is connected to the old town by Newbegin and New Road, and includes much of the Victorian development of the town. Buildings in the town are predominately red brick, with pantile or slate roofs; some structures use local cobbles as a building material. Modern Hornsea also incorporates several caravan sites, mainly on the northern and southern edge. There are two notable parks in Hornsea, Hall Garth Park which includes a historic moated site, and the Memorial Gardens.

The area of &#x27;old&#x27; Hornsea centred on the Market Place, and including Hall Garth Park and the large houses around Hornsea Town railway station and Grosvenor Road are now (2007) part of a Conservation Area – the area excludes the 19th/20th century resort, and promenade.

Like other small North Sea coastal resorts Hornsea has a promenade, laid out gardens, hotels, fish and chip shops, gift shops and so on. On the southern edge of Hornsea, near the site of Hornsea Pottery is a shopping centre known as Hornsea Freeport – the Freeport adapted some of the original theme park set up by Hornsea Pottery.

There are three schools in Hornsea: Hornsea Community Primary School, Hornsea Burton Primary School and Hornsea School and Language College.

Hornsea has an independent lifeboat service provided by Hornsea Inshore Rescue, a registered charity since 1994.

Hornsea has a high frequency of all-day public transport bus service to and from Hull, Beverley, Hessle and a daily service to Bridlington, and to Withernsea.

==History==

===Prehistory to medieval===
There is evidence of prehistoric human activity in the area. Near Norththorpe, north of Hornsea crop marks indicate a site interpreted as a Neolithic henge monument, thought to have been later reused as a Bronze Age ringwork. The site is similar to one excavated at Paddock Hill, near Thwing. The site consists of cropmarks indicating circular ditch surrounding a diameter circular area, with a probably entrance point at the east-south-east. There are cropmark indications that an outer ditch existed and that a roundhouse or henge was located inside the monument. Prehistoric finds in Hornsea include a polished Neolithic stone axehead, Neolithic or Bronze Age flints, and Bronze Age flint arrowhead.

There are also cropmarks in the Hornsea area indicating human activity during the Iron Age/Roman Britain period, thought to the remnants of field systems.

An Anglo-Saxon burial ground was discovered in 1913 near the Hydro on Cliff Road – the site was re-excavated in 1982. Thirteen skeletons were initially found, and a further six at the later excavations – a wide variety of grave goods were found including vases, and objects of bronze, ivory, bone, silver, jet and beads.

Hornsea is mentioned as a Manor, as &quot;Hornesse&quot;, in the Domesday Book of 1086. After the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, overlordship passed from Morcar to Drogo de la Beuvrière. Drogo fled to Flanders after killing his wife, a relative of William the Conqueror, and Holderness subsequently passed to Odo, Count of Aumale. In around 1088 Odo gave the manor, church and lands at Hornsea to the Benedictine St Mary&#x27;s Abbey, York. Rights of fishing in the Mere also passed to the Abbey.
The church of Saint Nicholas dates to the 13th century, with alterations in the 14th and 15th centuries. The church is of cobbles plus stone dressings, much of it in the perpendicular style. The font, some memorials and an effigy also date to the 13th century, a restored former medieval market cross is found in the churchyard. The church tower was formerly surmounted by a spire, reported as ruinous in the early 1710s and said to have fallen down in 1733. The church was extensively restored in the 1860s by George Gilbert Scott, including rebuilding of the upper tower; further work was done at the beginning of the 20th century by Brodrick, Lowther &amp; Walker. The medieval rectory of the church was located to the north, at a moated site – some earthwork remains are still extant, and were incorporated into the public Hall Garth Park in the 19th century. Other remnants of the medieval town include a wayside cross on Southgate, probably formed of remnants of other medieval crosses.

During the medieval period Hornsea was a market town, and also functioned as a fishing town and port. In 1377 the Poll Tax recorded 271 tax payers in Hornsea, and a further 264 at Hornsea Beck, and 96 at Hornsea Burton; in 1490 the parish of Hornsea recorded that there were 340 persons in Hornsea, and 240 at Hornsea Beck and 50 at Hornsea Burton.

There is limited evidence on the extent to which Hornsea functioned as a port. However, there are several medieval references to it. In 1228 documents refer to tolls on merchandise from ships both north and south of the beck. Holinshed noted &quot;Horneseie Beck&quot; as amongst the places on the coast used for trade; and sometime before the reign of Elizabeth I (16th century) the large sum of £3,000 had been spent on a pier at Hornsea – it was destroyed by the sea sometime around the latter half of the 16th century.

Coastal erosion had ended Hornsea&#x27;s importance as a port by the 16th century, though its market continued to be important locally.

After the Dissolution of the Monasteries (1540) right of ownership of Hornsea were returned to the Crown from St Mary&#x27;s Abbey. Subsequently, the property was split into three parts – the manor, church and mere.

There were windmills in Hornsea during the medieval period – two belonging to the Abbey of St Mary&#x27;s are recorded in the 16th century. There was another in Hornsea Burton, recorded as early as 1584, and is documented again in 1663, with the site still recorded in the late 19th century – the mill was located at the end of the Mill Lane (now Burton Lane).

===17th to 19th centuries===
83 houses were recorded for tax purposes in 1676; and a record of 133 families in the parish was made in 1743. By 1801 the population was 533, rising steadily to 704 by 1811, then to 780 in 1831, and to 1,005 in 1841.

There were several Quakers in Hornsea in the mid 17th century – an early meeting room was in a cottage in Westgate. In 1676 three cottages in Southgate were recorded as being given up for the use as a cemetery by the Acklams, a Quaker family.

In 1732 the town was struck by a &#x27;hurricane&#x27; which in addition to destroying the church&#x27;s spire, unroofed around 40 buildings, as well as causing part of the vicarage to collapse, and overturned one windmill. Another windmill is recorded on Atwick Road in 1732, and in 1820–21 a new windmill was built – by 1909 it was steam operated.

Historically, the common building material in the area has been brick or cobbles – extant buildings in brick date to as early as the late 17th century, alternatively large cobbles have also been used in the area for building construction – several structures of this type survive in the town, dating to the late 17th, 18th or 19th century, including some listed buildings, utilising cobbles or cobbles with brick. The Old Hall in Hornsea Market Place dates to the early 17th century, and is built of brick on cobble foundations.

Whilst enclosure at Hornsea Burton had begun around 1660, the fields around Hornsea were enclosed in 1809.
By the mid 19th century Hornsea comprised three main streets at the eastern end of the Mere – Westgate, Southgate and Market Place; two streets, Newbegin and Eastgate led eastward towards the sea from Market Place, merging around from the cliff – the land east of Hornsea town towards the sea was in agricultural use.

A Quaker meeting house, located to the rear of Westgate, now known as &#x27;Quaker Cottage&#x27; was used in the 18th century for meetings. Non-conformist churches were built in the early 19th century – an Independent chapel was built on Southgate near to the Market Place , with a burial ground to the rear; and a Wesleyan chapel built on the corner of Back Southgate/Mere Side/Chamber&#x27;s Lane , (replaced in 1870 by one in Newbegin and later used as a school); a Primitive Methodist chapel was built on Westgate in 1835, replaced and then demolished after a replacement was built in the Market Place in 1864, with a minister&#x27;s house built on the site.

A tower folly, Bettison&#x27;s Folly was built , by local brewmaster William Bettison, a tower built by a local business man in the 19th century. The tower contains the only fully working retractable flag pole in the country.

Hornsea was promoted as a seaside resort from around 1800, with early attractions including bathing machines, horse races on the beach and a chalybeate spring near the mere. More facilities were built in the 1830s including the first Marine Hotel.
A railway line was sanctioned in 1846 from Arram to Hornsea in 1846, but was unbuilt following the fall of George Hudson and the financial problems of the York and North Midland Railway. In 1861 a company was formed to promote railways in the East Riding of Yorkshire, and obtained an act for a line from Wilmington, Kingston upon Hull to Hornsea in 1862. Joseph Armitage Wade, a Hull timber merchant and Hornsea resident was a key promoter of the line. Work began October 1862, with the line completed early 1864 the Hull and Hornsea Railway. Hornsea Railway Station was designed by Rawlins Gould, built in brick with sandstone, with five central bays surrounded by two five bay extensions on either side – the station is still extant and was listed 1979. Hornsea Bridge railway station was built short of the Hornsea Town terminus, and functioned as a goods station as well as a passenger station. The new railway not only benefited the resort, but also enabled Hornsea to function as a dormitory suburb to Hull.

There was significant growth in the small scale fishing that took place at Hornsea before the railway – persons recorded as Fishermen rose from 3 in 1851 to a dozen or more in the 1870s to 1890s, with 12 boats and 20 men recorded in 1894 – crab was the major catch, rather than wet fish – crabbing continued to the 1930s but declined after the Second World War.
At the same time as the promotion and development of the railway the town was also improved: New Road was laid out in 1848 to improve access to the sea – in the 1860s/&#x27;70s Joseph Wade establishing a brick and tile works, and developed Grosvenor Terrace – No.31 of which was layered with his patent &#x27;Acorn&#x27; tiles. The coming of the railway was followed by further development, including Alexandra Hotel (1867); Wilton Terrace (1868); the high status dwellings Brampton House (1872–73); and the Grosvenor Estate, built during the period from 1865 to the early 20th century.

Civic improvements following or coincidental the opening of the railway included a gas works (1864, J.A. Wade); a gasworks for the Lansdowne estate, Cliff Road (1870, W.M. Jackson, closed 1899); improved drainage (1874–75, local board); and a Waterworks on Atwick Road (, local board).

Wade&#x27;s brickworks was established south of Hornsea Bridge railway station – by 1890 an hydraulic engineering works had been established adjacent west, both close to the site of the modern Freeport. There was also a short lived brickworks north of the mere, and sand and gravel extraction also took place in the parish, as well as lime kiln activity. (see also § Geology.)

The sea front was also developed, the 1837 Marine Hotel was rebuilt in 1874, and again in 1900; gardens were added to the north in 1898; and the Imperial Hydro Hotel built 1914 on the Esplanade (demolished ). Between 1878 and 1880 a pier was constructed – it was damaged within a year after a ship collided with it during a storm, shortening it by . In 1897 the pier was sold for demolition. The entrance building remained as an amusement arcade until the 1920s.

Other notable mid 19th century additions to the town include the two storey three bay vicarage on Newbegin; the stuccoed Pike and Heron public house (); a Primitive Methodist chapel in the Market Place built 1864; a Gothic Revival style non-conformist Congregational church on Hornsea Cliff Road/New Road, built 1868; and the Wesleyan church and adjacent church hall on Newbegin, built 1870, replacing the one in Back Southgate.

By 1864 the population had risen on 1,685, then to 1,836 in 1881 and to 2,013 by 1891, reaching 2,381 by 1901.

===20th century===

By the early 1900s the old town centred on the Market Place had grown little, but new developments had been built near Hornsea Town railway station, specifically the new streets of Eastbourne, Burton, and Alexandra Road; additionally a new estate had been built at the sea front, north of the old road to the sea along Cliff Road – this included the (new) Marine Hotel, as well the promenade and gardens parallel to the new Flamborough Terrace Road and the new (1907) sea defences. The promenade and gardens (Victoria Gardens) were begun in the 1890s. The &#x27;Floral Hall&#x27; was added to the seafront gardens in 1913 – both the gardens and hall were extended in 1928.

New sea defences were constructed following a destructive storm on the east coast in March 1906. The timber defences were destroyed or damaged by the storm with most of the beach swept away, and a large amount of cliff eroded exposing the underlying clay. The new defences at Hornsea were constructed north of New Road protecting the seafront at Marine Terrace and Victoria Gardens. The works consisted of four groynes plus a concrete sea wall reinforced by steel pile supports. The work was carried out by A. Fasey and Son (Leytonstone) under W.T. Douglas of Westminster. The sea wall was lengthened by to the north and south respectively in 1923, and extended south beyond the stream dike outlet of the mere in 1930.
Early 20th century additions to the town included a Church Institute built 1906–07; and the Pickering Almshouses (see Christopher Pickering) built 1908; both on Newbegin. A convalescent home, Gregson Court was built on Cliff Road in 1908–09. The early 20th century house, &#x27;Farrago&#x27;, on Wilton Road, built with a bolted steel frame with brick and stone dressing by builder David Reynard Robinson is now listed. Hornsea Golf Course was established a mile south of the town in 1910 to a design by Sandy Herd. (The course is outside the modern parish in Mappleton.)

During the First World War a seaplane base was constructed on Hornsea Mere, named RNAS Hornsea Mere, the base was used to operate submarine patrols in the North Sea. The base was abandoned after the end of the war.

By the 1920s the town had grown further, generally infill and fringe development, as well as housing further along Newbegin and Eastgate blurring the separation between the old town and the seaside resort. A park had also been built between the Eastgate and Newbegin filling the area formerly known as Hall Garths. Some housing had also been built in the area around Hornsea Bridge station.

Civic improvements in the interbellum included transfer of the fire brigade (est.1902) to a former lifeboat house (1924); reconstruction of the sewers and supply of water from Hull via a water tower at Mappleton (1927); and an electricity supply, via the &quot; South East Yorkshire Light &amp; Power Co. Ltd.&quot;, with power supplied by Hull Corporation (1930). In 1927, the Urban District Council converted Elim Lodge into Hornsea Town Hall.
In 1938 Wakefield Metropolitan District Council opened a school in Hornsea on the open air principle, the site was used by the Free French during the Second World War, and later returned to educational use.

During the Second World War Hornsea was fortified with numerous anti-invasion structures, designed to prevent a beachhead being established at Hornsea by invading forces – beach defences consisted of pillboxes flanking the promenade, whilst the beach was protected by anti-tank cubes and mines; at South Cliff 4.7-inch guns were installed. Beyond the beach any potential invasion was protected against by road and rail blocks, further pillboxes, and minefields, limiting routes through the town to three roads and the railway line – the road access was narrowed by the use of concrete blocks and protected by pillboxes – the fortification was intended to hold up or delay any invasion force landing at Hornsea.

Many of the predominantly reinforced concrete structures are no longer extant, the recorded defences include: coastal beach defence batteries, with 4.7-inch gun batteries, other gun emplacements, numerous pillboxes, road blocks and road and railway antitank obstacles, including extensive anti-tank cubes on the beach, Royal Observer Corps posts, weapons pits and/or infantry trenches, barbed wire protected trackways and Army camps and associated facilities, including a camp &quot;Rolston camp&quot;, located east of the Hornsea Bridge suburb on ground now destroyed by coastal erosion, with associated infantry trenches, grenade ranges, strongpoints and minefields, some farm buildings were also fortified. Other Second World War structures also included air raid shelters, and &#x27;Diver&#x27; anti-aircraft battery designed to destroy V1 flying bombs.
By the middle of the 20th century Hornsea had continued to grow, with new housing built or under construction south of Hornsea Town station, and at the coastal resort. New schools had also been established.

Hornsea&#x27;s population rose consistently through the 20th century, with growth averaging several hundred persons per decade – by 1951 the population had risen by nearly 3,000 from 1900 levels to 5,324.
Hornsea Pottery was founded 1949. In 1953 the business was moved to the former Wade brickworks (Marlborough Avenue), and the Hornsea Pottery Co. Ltd. established 1955. The company became a major local employer with 200 persons working by the 1960s.
The Church of the Sacred Heart (Catholic) was built in 1956 on Southgate.

The Hull to Hornsea railway line was closed in 1964/5. Hornsea Bridge Station was later demolished. The railway line&#x27;s closure led to some contraction of the tourist industry, and decline in the town.

Civic improvements in the second half of the 20th century included a new fire station on Southgate (1965); the closure of the gas works, and transfer to North Sea gas (late 1960s); and a new outfall sewer and pumping station (1970s). Small industrial estates were built off Cliff Road in the late 1960s, and near Rolston Road on former railway land in the 1980s. (&quot;Hornsea Bridge Industrial estate&quot;, Old Bridge Road)

Much of the post war expansion was around south of Hornsea Bridge station, and west of Cliff Road to the north. By 1970 Hornsea&#x27;s urban expansion had reached near the level maintained until the end of the 20th century. Housing was expanded to the west of the town off the B1244/Westgate on Cheyne Walk and later Cheyne Garth after the 1970s. The estate south of the town was expanded with the addition of Tansley Lane .

A museum, &quot;The North Holderness Museum of Village Life&quot; (Hornsea Museum) was established in 1978, on Newbegin. Hornsea Pottery entered receivership in 1984 and after several changes of owner production ended in 2000. A visitor attraction was built at the site – in 1994 &#x27;Hornsea Freeport&#x27;, a shopping attraction, was opened at the site. The town gained a swimming pool at &#x27;Hornsea Leisure Centre&#x27; in 1996.

===21st century===

In 2009 Tesco submitted and had accepted an application to build a large store near Southgate. The store opened January 2012.

By 2011, Hornsea&#x27;s population was 8,432, increasing from 8,243 in 2001, and from 7,934 persons in 1991.

In 2012, a former Methodist chapel was converted for use as the latest incarnation of Hornsea Town Hall.

==Lost villages==
===Hornsea Beck===
Hornsea Beck was a small village or hamlet close to the sea – it is recorded in existence as early as 1367, and had been completely destroyed by the coastal erosion by . Losses to the sea of 38 houses are recorded from 1546 to 1609.

===Hornsea Burton===
:&quot;See also § History&quot;
Hornsea Burton was located to the south-east of Hornsea Town. The present &#x27;Hornsea Burton Road&#x27; leads east to the coast where it stops, but it once continued some half a mile further to Hornsea Burton village, now long since inundated by the sea. By 1840 the remaining western part of the village was depopulated.
===Northorpe===
Northorpe was located north of Hornsea. The site was completely depopulated sometime between the late 1600s and 1809.

===Southorpe===
The village was once a settlement at Southorpe, on the south side of the mere – the village was recorded by the Domesday survey, and existed until the 17th century. By the beginning of the 19th century the village had been abandoned.

<text>Kirkby Lonsdale () is a town and civil parish in the Westmorland and Furness district of Cumbria, England, on the River Lune. Historically in Westmorland, it lies south-east of Kendal on the A65. The parish recorded a population of 1,771 in the 2001 census, increasing to 1,843 at the 2011 Census. 

Notable buildings include St Mary&#x27;s Church, a Norman building with fine carved columns. The view of the River Lune from the churchyard is known as Ruskin&#x27;s View after John Ruskin, who called it one of the loveliest in England. It was painted by J. M. W. Turner.

==Governance==
Kirkby Lonsdale is in the Morecambe and Lunesdale parliamentary constituency; Lizzi Collinge of the Labour Party was elected as its Member of Parliament at the 2024 general election.

In local government the town is within Westmorland and Furness. Until 2023 it was in the Kirkby Lonsdale ward of South Lakeland District Council and the Sedbergh &amp; Kirkby Lonsdale Division of Cumbria County Council. It has a parish council, Kirkby Lonsdale Town Council.

==Early history==
Early signs of occupation include a Neolithic stone circle on Casterton Fell and remains of Celtic settlements at Barbon, Middleton and Hutton Roof.

During the Roman period, a Roman road followed the River Lune, linking forts at Low Borrow Bridge near Tebay and Over Burrow, south of Kirkby Lonsdale. A Roman milestone unearthed in 1836 and described as &quot;the best in the country&quot; was re-erected on a hill near Hawkin Hall (SD 623 859), close to where it was found.
Kirkby Lonsdale developed at a crossing over the River Lune, where drovers&#x27; and pack-horse routes converged. It is one of few Cumbrian towns mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Book, where it is called Cherchibi (village with a church). An earlier church was rebuilt by the Normans, who erected an artificial mound or motte on nearby glebe land. A wooden tower or keep is thought to have surmounted the stronghold as a base for controlling the surrounding area.

In later years, the mound was used for cockfighting, hence the current name of Cockpit Hill. In 1093, Ivo de Taillebois (Baron of Kendal) granted the church at Kirkby Lonsdale to St Mary&#x27;s Abbey in York, which held it until the Dissolution. Thereafter the abbey and its possessions, including St Mary&#x27;s Church, passed to Trinity College, Cambridge, which retains the patronage to this day.

In 1227, the town gained a market charter and the right to hold an annual fair every September. Each week stallholders gathered in Market Street to sell their wares, as did horse traders in the Horsemarket and pig sellers in Swinemarket. Thursday was as now the scene of great activity. Kirkby has an annual festival called the Victorian Fair.

==19th century onward==

The weekly market and daily throughput of drovers and pack-horse carriers created a bustling town, with a total of 29 inns and alehouses, of which eight remain. By the early 19th century, the old market area was becoming too congested and a new market place was built in 1822.
The steep incline of Mill Brow with its fast-flowing, now culverted stream was the industrial heart of Kirkby Lonsdale, with several mills using water power for grinding corn, bark and bone, carding wool, manufacturing snuff, making bobbins and fulling cloth, and sawing timber.

The Keighley and Kendal Turnpike of 1753 passed through Kirkby Lonsdale and met there with a turnpike from Milnthorpe on the coast. In 1818, the two trusts were amalgamated. Kirkby Lonsdale railway station, away in Lancashire, opened in 1861 and closed to passengers in 1954.

Today Kirkby Lonsdale remains a busy town with a market. The centre has a mixture of elegant 18th-century buildings and stone cottages huddled round cobbled courtyards and narrow alleyways, with names such as Salt Pie Lane and Jingling Lane.

St Mary&#x27;s Church is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Kendal, the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. Its benefice is united with those of six local churches to form the Kirkby Lonsdale Team Ministry. It contains Norman architecture and is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building.

Kirkby Lonsdale&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth School on Biggins Road is a secondary school specialising in the performing arts, sports and languages.

A two-day Victorian fair used to be hosted in the town each September. The streets were closed to traffic and filled with traders&#x27; stalls, craft demonstrations and entertainment, while visitors were encouraged to wear Victorian dress.

Motorbike enthusiasts meet every Sunday at Devil&#x27;s Bridge.

==Devil&#x27;s Bridge==

The town is noted for the Devil&#x27;s Bridge (), which at one time carried the Skipton to Kendal road over the River Lune. It dates from around 1370 and is built of fine gritstone ashlar. Of its three spans, the western two measure each and the eastern one , or from river to parapet. The piers are hexagonal, round and extending upwards to provide pedestrian refuges. At the eastern end is a sundial in the form of a square block on an octagonal column. The bridge was probably built by monks of St Mary&#x27;s Abbey, York.

Like many bridges of the same name, it features a legend that the Devil appeared to an old woman, promising to build a bridge in exchange for the first soul to cross over it. When the bridge was finished, the woman threw bread over the bridge and her dog chased after it, thereby outwitting the Devil. Several large stones in the surrounding area, including the Great Stone of Fourstones, are ascribed to the Devil&#x27;s purse strings bursting open as he ferried masonry to build it. It was repaired in 1705 and repointed in 1829 using Roman-style cement. The eastern arch was repaired in about 1869.

The roadway on the bridge is only wide, insufficient for modern traffic. As numbers increased the bridge was closed to vehicles in 1932. Traffic instead crosses the river by the Stanley Bridge, to the south, which was built in the 1930s. Devil&#x27;s Bridge is a Grade I listed structure and a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

The river beneath Devil&#x27;s Bridge is popular with scuba divers for its relatively easy access and egress, deep rock pools (about 16 ft in a low swell) and good visibility. The bridge also witnesses illegal &quot;tombstoning&quot; (bridge diving), which has caused at least one death, of a 22-year-old man in 2012.

==Lee Child/Jack Reacher connection==
One of the world&#x27;s bestselling thriller writers, Lee Child, author and creator of Jack Reacher, was living in the town when he wrote his first novel, &quot;Killing Floor&quot;. 

In 1994, Jim Grant was a television executive, recently made redundant from Granada Television in Manchester, when he decided, out of financial necessity, to become a thriller writer. He was living at 10 Abbotsgate, just off Mitchelgate, in Kirkby Lonsdale at the time -- his daughter Ruth was a pupil at the Queen Elizabeth School.

He chose the name &#x27;Lee Child&#x27; as a pseudonym because it was short and would slip alphabetically between Raymond Chandler and Agatha Christie on bookstore shelves. He began writing his first novel with a modern knight errant as his hero, but he didn&#x27;t have a name for his character. Grant came up with the name &#x27;Reacher&#x27; on a shopping trip to Asda supermarket in Kendal.

Grant&#x27;s favoured watering hole was the Snooty Fox in the centre of Kirkby Lonsdale. Once a week he, his American wife Jane and friends would form a team in the pub quiz at the Pheasant Inn at nearby Casterton. It was at the Pheasant that he received an enthusiastic phone call from a London literary agent on Thursday, 7 December 1995.

<text>An Enemy of the People (original Norwegian title: &quot;En folkefiende&quot;) is an 1882 play by Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen that explores the conflict between personal integrity and societal norms. The play centers on Dr. Thomas Stockmann, who discovers a serious contamination issue in his town&#x27;s new spas, endangering public health. His courageous decision to expose this truth brings severe backlash from local leaders, including his brother Peter Stockmann, who is a powerful political figure in the town.

Set against the backdrop of a community grappling with economic and environmental concerns, the play highlights the often harsh consequences faced by those who challenge established systems. Ibsen’s depiction of this struggle emphasizes the tension between truth and expediency. The character of Peter Stockmann is based on Ibsen’s own uncle, Christian Cornelius Paus, whose political influence and authoritative role in Ibsen&#x27;s hometown of Skien parallel those of Peter in the play. Ibsen himself was uncertain about the play&#x27;s classification, noting in a letter to his publisher that it contained both comedic and serious elements, reflecting his complex view of the protagonist&#x27;s moral stance. This exploration of moral and societal conflict follows Ibsen’s earlier work, &quot;Ghosts&quot;, which faced similar criticism for its bold critique of societal norms.

==Plot overview==
===Act I===
Dr. Thomas Stockmann is the medical officer of a recently opened spa in a small town. The play begins with a dinner party hosted by Dr. Stockmann and his wife, Katrine. The dinner guests include Dr. Stockmann&#x27;s brother Peter (the mayor) and Hovstad (the editor of the newspaper). Peter asks Stockmann about a rumor that Hovstad is about to print an article the doctor wrote regarding the spa baths. Dr. Stockmann is evasive about the nature of this article, and Peter leaves. Petra, Dr. Stockmann&#x27;s daughter, brings in a letter containing lab test results confirming Dr. Stockmann&#x27;s suspicions that the spa water is contaminated with bacteria, and Hovstad agrees to print Dr. Stockmann&#x27;s article, although revealing the truth may force the baths to shut down, with negative repercussions for the town&#x27;s economy. Dr. Stockmann has mixed reactions to these events but ultimately rejoices about preventing the harm that the contaminated water would have caused.

===Act II===
The next morning Morten Kiil, Dr. Stockmann&#x27;s father-in-law, stops by to congratulate him on what Kiil believes is an elaborate prank, since Kiil thinks the notion that the baths are tainted is too ridiculous to be believed, especially not by the mayor. Hovstad and the printer Aslaksen visit to reinforce their commitment to the doctor and extend their gratitude; the newspaper wants to confront the government of the town and expose its corruption, and this opportunity is a good start.

Peter arrives and tells Dr. Stockmann that if he selfishly proceeds to publish this article, he will be partially culpable for the town&#x27;s ruin. Peter urges Dr. Stockmann to think of the bigger picture, retract the article, and solve the problem in a quieter way. Dr. Stockmann refuses; Peter warns of terrible consequences for him and his family.

===Act III===
In the newspaper office, Hovstad and the sub-editor, Billing, discuss the pros and cons of running Dr. Stockmann&#x27;s article. Dr. Stockmann arrives and tells them to print the article, but they begin questioning how valuable it is to expose the government in this way, concluding that printing this article will do more harm than good, because of its likely effect on the town&#x27;s economy. Peter Stockmann appears with a statement of his own, intended to reassure the public about the safety of the spa baths, and the newspaper agrees to print it. Desperate, Dr. Stockmann decides that he does not need the paper to print anything and that he can fight this battle on his own. He decides to call a town meeting and spread the information that way. Although Katrine Stockmann realizes that her husband is risking his reputation, she stands by him.

===Act IV===
At a town meeting in Captain Horster&#x27;s house, Dr. Stockmann is about to read his water report to the townspeople. Billing, the family, the mayor, Aslaksen, and Hovstad are there. Aslaksen, a respected citizen, is elected Chairman of the meeting. Permission for Dr. Stockmann&#x27;s being allowed to speak is about to be voted on, when Dr. Stockmann says he has a different subject. He then winds up into a passionate oration about social evolution. He says that new, truthful ideas are always condemned, due to the &quot;colossal stupidity of the authorities&quot; and the small-mindedness of &quot;the compact liberal majority&quot; of the people, who may as well &quot;be exterminated.&quot; The audience feels insulted by these accusations and anger rises. By the end of the meeting the audience has rebelled, repeatedly shouting, &quot;He is an enemy of the people!&quot; Dr. Stockmann tells his father-in-law, Kiil, that it is his tannery that is leaking most of the poisons into the baths. As the crowd is leaving, voices are heard threatening to break Stockmann&#x27;s windows.

===Act V===
By the next morning, Dr. Stockmann&#x27;s house, especially his study, has been badly damaged, for the town has turned against him and his family. The landlord is evicting them from their house; Petra has been fired from her job as a schoolteacher for having progressive opinions; Peter comes to the house with a letter from the board of directors of the baths that terminates his contract along with a resolution from the homeowners&#x27; association stating that no one should hire Dr. Stockmann in this town again.

Dr. Stockmann&#x27;s father-in-law, Morton Kiil, arrives to say that he has just bought shares in the Baths with the money that he had intended to leave to his daughter and grandchildren. Kiil expects this will cause his son-in-law to stop his crusade, to ensure that the spa does not go bankrupt and his family will have a secure future. Dr. Stockmann rebuffs Kiil&#x27;s threat and also ignores Peter&#x27;s advice to leave town for a few months. Katrine tells Dr. Stockmann she is afraid that the people will drive him out of town. But Dr. Stockmann replies that he intends to stay and make them understand &quot;that considerations of expediency turn morality and justice upside down.&quot; He ends by proclaiming himself the strongest man in town because he is able to stand alone.

==Cast==
==Themes==
In &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot;, speaking the language of comic exaggeration through the mouth of his spokesman, the idealist Doctor Thomas Stockmann, Ibsen puts into very literal terms the theme of the play: It is true that ideas grow stale and platitudinous, but one may go one step further and say flatly that truths die. According to Stockmann, there are no absolute principles of either wisdom or morality. In this Ibsen is referring indirectly to the reception of his previous plays. For example, the commandment &quot;honor thy father and thy mother&quot; referred to in &quot;Ghosts&quot; is not simply either true or false. It may have been a truth once and a falsehood today. As Stockmann states in his excited harangue to his political enemies: 
Yet, Ibsen addresses in an engaging manner a number of challenges that remain highly relevant today, such as environmental issues (versus economic interests), professional responsibilities (of experts in policy debates) and, last but not least, the moral dilemmas and tensions involved in whistle blowing.

==Background==

As in any other plays, Ibsen derived names and traits from his relatives, including the name Stockmann, a real family in Telemark from which lbsen himself was descended; Ibsen was also born in Stockmanngaarden in Skien. Peter Stockmann, who in the Norwegian original holds the offices of (city judge/magistrate) and (chief of police), was based on lbsen&#x27;s uncle, Christian Cornelius Paus, who held the same two offices in Skien and who was also a descendant of the Stockmann family. In Dr. Stockmann&#x27;s &quot;buttoned-up brother, the magistrate, who sticks to tea and advocates moderation and respect for society&#x27;s laws,&quot; the parallel to the magistrate Paus becomes almost too obvious, writes Ibsen scholar Jon Nygaard.

==Reception==
The play has gained renewed attention in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.

=== Critical reviews ===
Scottish drama critic William Archer, an early and contemporary advocate of Ibsen&#x27;s plays, said the play was less sensational than some of Ibsen&#x27;s earlier efforts, but was a strong drama with excellent dialogue and characters.

==Adaptations==
A Nazi adaptation of the play was Hans Steinhoff&#x27;s 1937 film &quot;Ein Volksfeind&quot;.

This classic play was adapted by Arthur Miller in the 1950s in a production that opened at the Broadhurst Theater on December 28, 1950. It starred Academy Award winner Fredric March and his wife Florence Eldridge as well as Morris Carnovsky; future Oscar winner Rod Steiger was a &quot;townsperson.&quot; Miller&#x27;s adaptation was presented on National Educational Television in 1966, in a production starring James Daly. It was also made into a movie of the same name in 1978, starring Steve McQueen. The BBC then cast Robert Urquhart as &quot;Tom Stockman&quot; in their 1980 TV version, adapting the story and the cast names to reflect it now being set in a Scottish town. In the creation of his adaptation of Ibsen&#x27;s work, several changes were made by Miller to make the play more accessible and accepting to a 1950s audience, as opposed to Ibsen&#x27;s late 1800s audience. Many major edits not only included the transformation of speech and language, but changes were made to the character of Dr. Stockmann to avoid having him champion eugenics. Throughout the play, Dr. Stockmann acts as a Christ figure. Miller found it necessary therefore to change Ibsen&#x27;s use of genetic and racial theories from the late 1800s to further Dr. Stockmann&#x27;s standing as a champion of the lower classes as opposed to a scientist with a belief in racial determinism and the importance of eugenics for &quot;improving&quot; people. For example, in Ibsen&#x27;s original, a portion of Dr. Stockmann&#x27;s speech to the people contained:
In Miller&#x27;s adaptation, no such eugenics-positive screed is read. Miller keeps Dr. Stockmann&#x27;s ideals as a character, and his dedication to facing down the hypocrisy of the aristocracy and governmental bureaucrats, but portrays him as more of a democratic thinker and socialist, while retaining some of the original character&#x27;s ideas about the evolution of animals and humans, and the need to cultivate humane qualities in order to bring the masses to a more rational and educated level, so that they can fully participate in a democracy. In Miller&#x27;s adaptation, part of the doctor&#x27;s speech reads:

A version was produced for Australian television in 1958.

The 1972 Greek film &quot;O ehthros tou laou&quot; (An Enemy of the People) is an adaptation of the play, taking place in Greece during the mid-1930s.

The play was the indirect inspiration for the blockbuster movie &quot;Jaws&quot;.

Satyajit Ray&#x27;s 1989 film &quot;Ganashatru&quot; was based on this play. In 1990, PBS produced the play for their show &quot;American Playhouse&quot;, starring William Anton and John Glover.

In 2000 an adaptation of the play called &quot;Paragon Springs&quot; written by Steven Dietz premiered at Milwaukee Repertory theatre in Milwaukee Wisconsin, U.S.A. The play is set in &quot;a small town in the American Midwest&quot; in 1926.

&quot;An Enemy of the People&quot; (with the subtitle &quot;The strongest one is the one who stands alone&quot;), a Norwegian film released in 2004 and directed by Erik Skjoldbjærg, is an adaptation of Ibsen&#x27;s play.

In 2007 Ouriel Zohar&#x27;s troupe Compagnie Ouriel Zohar performed an adaptation for two actors only of &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot;, performed first in Paris, then Fréjus, Besançon (2008), Liège, Minsk, Valleyfield (Canada, 2009), and Porto Heli (Greece, 2010).

In early 2013, a stage adaptation entitled &quot;عدو الشعب&quot; (Arabic: &quot;Enemy of the people&quot; or &quot;A Public Enemy&quot;) was organized and directed by Nora Amin (who played Doctor Stockmann&#x27;s wife, with Tarek El-Dewiri as Doctor Stockmann) in Cairo. It was translated into colloquial Arabic and featured a rock-themed soundtrack played live on-set. Jointly sponsored by the Norwegian Embassy in Cairo and the Ibsen Studies Center in Norway, it received various positive reviews at a time when Egypt was plunged into deep political turmoil.

A new adaptation by Robert Falls, based on a 19th-century translation by Eleanor Marx, was staged at Chicago&#x27;s Goodman Theatre from March - April 2018.

In Autumn 2021, a new National Theatre of Scotland adaptation entitled simply &quot;Enemy&quot;, authored by Keiran Hurley and directed by Finn den Hertog, toured Scotland. The play is set in a fictional Scottish town, is written using contemporary language and makes use of innovative technical effects such as overhead projected Twitter feeds, social media comments, and video live streams.

In 2024 at Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre, Thomas Ostermeier directed an adaptation he co-wrote with Florian Borchmeyer. It was first staged in 2012, but was translated from German to English by Duncan Macmillan for the London performance. Starring Matt Smith and Jessica Brown Findlay, the adaptation converts the Act IV town meeting into an audience participation event which allows contemporary issues to be aired.

A new adaptation by Amy Herzog on Broadway at the Circle in the Square Theatre previewed on February 27, 2024, with an opening night March 18. The production was directed by Sam Gold and starred Jeremy Strong, Michael Imperioli, and Victoria Pedretti. Strong won the Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Play for his performance.

==Censored in Mainland China==
&quot;An Enemy of the People&quot;, produced by Berlin&#x27;s Schaubühne theater, was performed in Beijing from September 6 to September 8, 2018, but the subsequent touring of the show was cancelled due to its themes. The audience in Beijing reportedly showed overwhelming support for Dr. Stockmann, and allegedly shouted criticism of the Chinese regime during interaction parts. Even in subsequent censored performances, audiences yelled &quot;for personal freedom!&quot; The regime&#x27;s censorship officers would not agree to any more touring unless the script was doctored in favor of the regime&#x27;s thought on what a play should be.

<doc id="374513" wikidata="Q1154385" url="?curid=374513" title="Swimming stroke">
<text>Human swimming typically consists of repeating a specific body motion or swimming stroketo propel the body forward. There are many kinds of strokes, each defining a different swimming style or crawl.

In high school, collegiate, and Olympic swimming, there are two undulating strokes (breaststroke and butterfly stroke) and two alternating strokes (front crawl and backstroke).

Most strokes involve rhythmic and coordinated movements of all major body parts — torso, arms, legs, hands, feet, and head. Breathing typically must be synchronized with the strokes, too. It is possible, however, to swim by moving only legs without arms or only arms without legs; such strokes may be used for special purposes, for training or exercise, or by amputees (paralympians) and paralytics.

==Swimming styles==
Within a competitive sense particularly, swim stroke techniques are continuously changing to become either easier or more efficient as more people explore the activity.
* Front crawl: the fastest style for swimming on the surface. Done while face down. The arms alternate while the legs perform a flutter kick.
** Dolphin crawl: Similar to front crawl, but with a dolphin kick. One kick per arm or two kicks per cycle. This style is often used in training.
** Catch up stroke: A variation of the front crawl where one arm always rests at the front while the other arm performs one cycle. This can also be used as a drill when training in competitive swimming.
** Head-high crawl (also known as the water polo stroke, lifeguard approach stroke, or Tarzan drill): This stroke is used for water polo, lifeguards to keep the victim in sight, or those who simply want to see where they&#x27;re going and breathe with ease. It is similar to front crawl, but with head above the water. This can also be used as a drill when training in competitive swimming.
* Trudgen: The trudgen is similar to the front crawl, except that it is paired with a scissors kick, similar to that used in the sidestroke.
** Trudgen crawl: Similar to the trudgen, but with the use of a flutter kick (up and down leg kick) between the scissors kicks.
** Double trudgen: Similar to the trudgen, but the sides of the scissors kick alternate.
** Double trudgen crawl: Similar to the double trudgen, but with a flutter kick between the scissors kick alternate.
* Butterfly stroke: performed face down in the water. The legs perform a dolphin kick while the arms move in a forward circle at the same time.
** Slow butterfly (also known as &quot;moth stroke&quot;): Similar to butterfly, but with an extended gliding phase, Breathing during the pull/push phase, return head into the water during recovery. This style uses two kicks per cycle.
* Breaststroke: performed face down in the water without rotating the torso. The arms stay in the water and move synchronously, while the legs perform a whip kick (which is sometimes called a breaststroke kick). It is possible to keep the head elevated out of the water throughout the stroke, although the head usually dips in and out.
** Inverted breaststroke: Similar to elementary backstroke, but with a whip kick and arm motions.
* Backstroke (Back crawl): Done while lying on the back. One arm reaches behind the head with a fingertip entry while the other arm is by the side. The legs perform a flutter kick.
** Elementary backstroke: Both arms move synchronized (They begin out like an airplane, then go beside the body like a soldier then they run up the sides and back out to an airplane position) with whip kick.
** Inverted butterfly: Similar to elementary backstroke, but with a dolphin kick. This is often used for training.
** Back double trudgen: Similar to the backstroke, but with a scissors kick to alternating sides.
**Old English Backstroke : Lying on back, breaststroke legs and butterfly arms
* Sidestroke: On the side, pull the water as if with a rope with arms going out and stopping in the middle while ensuring that the strokes are most hydrodynamic when moving towards the desired location, and pushing the most water when moving away from the location. In addition, the legs are performing a scissors kick, which is like whip kick, but sideways.
** Lifesaving stroke: Similar to the side stroke, but only the bottom arm moves while the top arm tows a swimmer in distress.
** Combat sidestroke: This stroke was developed and used by the United States Navy SEALs and is designed to be more efficient and reduce profile in the water.
* Composite stroke is drill stroke within one basic stroke, &quot;ins&quot; (for example, Front crawl flutter/scissor Dolphin/Dolphin flutter) or between two basic stroke, &quot;weens&quot; (Over arm 1 Arm Lead Sidestroke to 2 Arms Lead Dolphin). It is a strength and stamina training technique.
* Dog paddle: face over water and paddling with alternate hands, often with the nose and mouth above the water. This stroke can be used in reverse to propel the body feet first.
* Survival travel stroke: Alternating underwater arm stroke, one cycle for propulsion, one for a lift to stay on the surface. This style is slow but sustainable.
* Breast feet first strokes: With legs extended, use the arms with a pushing, flapping, clapping or uplifting motion.
* Snorkeling: Swimming on the breast using a snorkel, usually in combination with masks and fins. Any stroke on the breast can be used, and there is no need to lift or turn the head for breathing.
* Finswimming is the progression of a swimmer using fins either on the water surface or underwater. Finswimming is usually done on the breast.
* Flutter back finning: Symmetrically underwater arm recovery with flutter kick.
* Feet first swimming: A very slow stroke on the back where a breaststroke movement with the arms propels the body forward feet first. Also the arms can be lifted out of the water and pulled backwards together with a scooping movement. Alternatively, the arms can be raised behind the head, alternately or together pushing with the hands, propelling the body. Similarly, the hands can be brought together in a clapping action. These strokes are often used for training.
* Corkscrew swimming: Alternating between front crawl and backstroke every arm. This leads to a constant rotation of the swimmer. The stroke is used mainly for training purposes and is also sometimes known as Newfie Stroke, referring to Newfoundland. When rotating every third stroke, this is called &quot;waltz crawl&quot;.
* Gliding: The swimmer is stretched with the arms to the front, the head between the arms and the feet to the back. This streamlined shape minimizes resistance and allows the swimmer to glide, for example after a start, a push off from a wall, or to rest between strokes.
* Turtle stroke: On the breast, extend right arm then pull, after pushing with the left leg (while opposite limbs are recovering), then opposite limbs repeat this process, i. e. left arm pulls after right leg pushes. Uses muscles of the waist. Head can easily be above or below water: this is a slow but very sustainable stroke, common in turtles and newts.
* Open water swimming: Mostly freestyle stroke. Difference is that due to swimming in open water visibility will be an issue and every 4th or 6th stroke the head is slightly lifted upwards for visibility.

A study done by Barbosa Tiago M. in a study called Energetics and biomechanics as determining factors of swimming performance: Updating the state of the art. This text discusses the relationship between segmental kinematics and center of mass kinematics in competitive swimming, focusing on how stroke length (SL) and stroke frequency (SF) influence swimming velocity (v) and performance. Freestyle is the fastest stroke, followed by Butterfly, Backstroke, and Breaststroke, with performance variations depending on distance and stroke technique. A decline in velocity during a race is linked to a decrease in SL, with greater reliance on SF for speed when SL is short. High-level swimmers maintain higher and more stable spatial-temporal parameters, particularly in Freestyle, where SF variability is lower than in Backstroke. Across laps, both genders exhibit a “zig-zag” pattern in SF, peaking during the final lap, with this pattern being more pronounced in males and less variable among elite swimmers.
A study done by Rejman Marek called Goggle-free swimming as autonomous water competence from the perspective of breath control on execution of a given distance. The study explored adolescents’ ability to maintain breathing rhythm while swimming with and without goggles, emphasizing water competence over stroke techniques. Results showed that the absence of goggles negatively impacted breath control for both genders, with boys struggling more to swim effectively and safely. The study recommends incorporating goggle-free swimming into elementary education, focusing on simple forms of swimming for breath control training, and accounting for gender differences in visual perception and motor control during instruction.

==Special purpose styles==
A number of strokes are only used for special purposes, e.g. to manipulate an object (a swimmer in distress, a ball), or just to stay afloat.

===Underwater swimming===
Swimming underwater is faster than swimming on the surface. Underwater swimming is not its own category in the Olympics, but in the 1988 Olympics several competitors swam much of the backstroke race underwater. After that, the Olympics created a rule that swimmers are only allowed to stay underwater for the first 10 meters (later changed to 15 meters) after a start or a turn.

Any style with underwater recovery can be done underwater for certain distances depending on the need for air. Underwater swimming on the back has the additional problem of water entering the nose. To avoid this, the swimmer can breathe out through the nose or wear a nose clip. Some swimmers can close their nostrils with the upper lip or with the compressor naris muscles.
* Dolphin kick: The feet kick up and down, while pressed together. This is the style that is usually used at the beginning of the race, to hold on to the speed the swimmer generates by pushing off the walls at the start and the turns. When it is used for underwater swimming, the arms are usually extended in front of the head, keeping still with the hands together.
* Fish kick: Similar to the dolphin kick, but performed while on the swimmer&#x27;s side. This may be the fastest form of swimming. Swimming creates vortices which propel the swimmer forward. In the dolphin kick, the vortices go up and down, where they&#x27;re disturbed when they hit the surface of the water or the bottom of the pool. But with the fish kick, they go sideways, where there are no obstructions.
* Pull-down Breaststroke: most common swim stroke underwater as it requires very low energy. Main application is for dynamic apnea (DNF)
* Sea lion stroke: based on the swimming style of sea lions, this swimming stroke is primarily performed with sculling, arms at the side along the bodyline and strongly supported with flutter kicks in a contralateral sequence. It is very effective when swimming through narrow underwater places.

===Lifesaving strokes===
* Lifesaving stroke: Similar to the side stroke, but only the bottom arm moves while the top arm tows a swimmer in distress.
* Lifesaving approach stroke (also known as &quot;head-up front crawl&quot; or &quot;Tarzan stroke&quot;): Similar to the front crawl, but with the eyes to the front above the water level, such as to observe the surroundings as for example a swimmer in distress or a ball.
* Pushing rescue stroke: This stroke helps to assist a tired swimmer: The tired swimmer lies on the back and the rescuer swims a whip kick and pushes against the soles of the tired swimmer (not taught or recognized by the RLSS body governing UK lifeguarding).
* Pulling rescue stroke: This stroke helps to assist a swimmer in distress. Both swimmers lie on the back, and the rescuer grabs the armpits of the swimmer in distress and performs a whip kick (on the back) for forwarding motion. The kick has to be not too shallow as otherwise the victim will be hit.
* Extended Arm Tow (unconscious victim): swimming sidestroke or breaststroke on their back, the rescuer holds the head with a straight arm, the hand cupping underneath the chin, and ensures that the mouth and nose are out of the water.
* Arm Tow: the rescuer swims sidestroke, behind the casualty holds the upper right arm of a casualty with their left hand or vice versa, lifting the casualty out of the water.
* Vice Grip Turn and Trawl: used on a victim with a suspected spinal injury. The lifeguard approaches slowly to the victim (who is usually face down in water), places one hand on the victim&#x27;s chin, with arm pressed firmly against the victim&#x27;s chest. The other hand is placed on the back of the victim&#x27;s head with the arm down the victim&#x27;s back. Both arms press together (like a vice), and the lifeguard uses his feet to begin moving forward and then rolls under the victim to come up alongside her or him, but with the victim now on his or her back. (This is one of the hardest lifesaving maneuvers, as the grip must be perfect on the first attempt; otherwise, the victim may be given further spinal damage, such as paralysis.)
* Clothes swimming: The swimmer is wearing clothes that restrict movement when wet, i.e. almost all clothes. This is done to practice situations where the swimmer fell in the water dressed or the rescuer did not have time to undress. Due to the restricted movement and the weight of wet clothes out of the water, overarm recovery is harder, which makes a style with underwater recovery, like the breaststroke, the better option.
* Rescue tube swimming: The lifeguard pulls a flotation device, which is pushed forward when approaching the victim.

===Without forward motion===

* Survival floating (also known as &quot;dead man float&quot; and drownproofing): Lying on the prone (face down in water) with minimal leg movement, and staying afloat with the natural buoyancy. Lift the head to breathe only then back to floating. This style is only to stay afloat and to rest.
* Back floating: Similar to the survival floating, except on the back.
* Treading water: The swimmer is in the water head up and feet down. Different kicks, such as the whip kick or eggbeater kick, and hand movements (Sculling) are used to stay afloat. This is useful to keep the head out of the water for a better view or to catch an object as for example in water polo. In addition, treading water is used in training by competitive swimmers in order to build up the strength of the kick; butterfly or scissors kick are most common when training vertically.
* Sculling: This is a figure 8 movement of the hands for forward motion or upward lift. Used in surf lifesaving, water polo, synchronized swimming and treading water.
* Turtle float: The knees are raised to the chest and encircled by the arms.
* Jellyfish float: Holding the ankles with the hands.
* Head first surface dive
* Foot first surface dive
* Pencil float

<text>Okehampton ( ) is a town and civil parish in West Devon in the English county of Devon. At the 2021 census, the parish had a population of 7,313, which was slightly more than the 7,104 recorded at the 2011 census. The Okehampton built-up area had a population of 9,112 at the 2021 census, up from 7,647 in 2011.

Okehampton is situated at the northern edge of Dartmoor west of Exeter, north of Plymouth and south of Barnstaple.

==Toponymy==
The name means settlement or estate (&quot;tun&quot;) on the River Okement. This is shown by early forms of the name, such as &quot;Ochementone&quot; as recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, and &quot;Okementon(a)&quot; in 1167 and 1275. The name was later associated with the common suffix &quot;-hampton&quot;, but as late as the 1930s the original name was remembered by the pronunciation &quot;Okington&quot; or &quot;Okenton&quot; still used by old people in the district.

==History==

Okehampton was founded by the Saxons. The earliest written record of the settlement is from 980 AD as , meaning settlement by the Ockment, a river which runs through the town. It was recorded as a place for slaves to be freed at cross roads.

Like many towns in the West Country, Okehampton grew on the medieval wool trade. Notable buildings in the town include the 15th century chapel of St. James and Okehampton Castle, which was established by the Norman Sheriff of Devon, Baldwin FitzGilbert (d.1090), and the 17th century Okehampton Town Hall.

===Feudal barony===
Okehampton was the caput of a large feudal barony, which at the time of the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; was held by Baldwin FitzGilbert. The tenure of the barony is obscure for the twenty years following his death in 1090. After that it was held by the heiress Maud d&#x27;Avranches until her death in 1173, and then passed to her daughter, Hawise de Curci (died 1219), who married Reginald de Courtenay. His French possessions were confiscated by the French King Louis VII, but were given, together with the marriage of his daughter Elizabeth de Courtenay, to his youngest brother Peter I of Courtenay. The Courtenay family rebuilt Okehampton Castle, until King Henry VIII seized the lands and had Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter executed for treason in 1539. The castle is now owned by English Heritage and is open to the public during the summer season. The town is also home to the Museum of Dartmoor Life, which has received notable visitors such as the then-Prince Charles.
===Political representation===
Okehampton elected two members to the Unreformed House of Commons. The Reform Act of 1832 abolished its representation as a rotten borough.
==Military presence==
There is a substantial army training camp on Dartmoor which can be reached via Okehampton, and is commonly referred to as &quot;Okehampton Camp&quot;. It is managed by the Defence Training Estate, and used by a variety of military units, including the Commando Training Centre Royal Marines (CTCRM), Lympstone, Devon, and many cadet training units. The Ten Tors event is run by the Army each year in early May from Okehampton Camp.

==Education==
Schools in the town include Okehampton Primary School and Okehampton College. There are also a number of smaller primary schools in the surrounding areas for children within the catchment area of Okehampton that include South Tawton, Hatherleigh, Chagford, North Tawton and Bridestowe.

== Religion ==
The Anglican parish church of All Saints is located on Church Path, on a slight hill to the west of the town centre. Its origins are Saxon, long predating the earliest recorded consecration by Bishop Bronescombe of Exeter in 1261. The medieval building was reconstructed in 1447, but was almost completely destroyed in a fire in 1842. Another reconstruction followed, overseen by John Hayward who incorporated an granite ashlar tower which survived the fire into the new church.

Within the building, the remnants of a reredos can be seen in the south aisle. Its replacement was constructed in stone by Harry Hems in 1891. The choir stalls and altar rails date from this time, while the pulpit is slightly earlier. Stained glass in the church includes work by Morris &amp; Co., the Kemp studios and Ward and Hughes. Some medieval glass is preserved in the Lady Chapel. The church is a Grade II* listed building.

Fairplace United Church is located on St James Street. The church has been a centre for both Methodism and the United Reformed Church. Fairplace Church was built in 1904 for the Wesleyan Methodists, who were joined by a congregation from the Bible Christian tradition in 1962. It then joined with the United Reform Church in 1974.

The Baptist Chapel on Fore Street was built in 1889 and enlarged in 1901. Other churches include the Okehampton New Life Church, a Pentecostal church, a Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses hall on East Street, and the Catholic church of St Boniface on Station Road.

==Climate==
Okehampton has a very wet temperate oceanic climate (Cfb), its location on the northwestern edge of Dartmoor makes for cooler temperatures and higher precipitation compared to lower-lying areas in Devon. The town centre received an annual average rainfall of 1,536mm circa 1981-2010, with certain areas to the south and west of the town exceeding 1,600mm.

==Sport==
The town&#x27;s football team, Okehampton Argyle F.C., is a non-league club which was established in 1926 after the original side, Okehampton Town, disbanded. The club competes in the South West Peninsula League which sits at Steps 6 and 7 of the National League System; four leagues below the top division of non-league football, the Football Conference. The town also has a rugby club, Okehampton RFC, which is believed to have been founded in 1884. There is also a table tennis club in the town that was purpose-built for the sport beside the local post office off the town.

==Media==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC South West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Caradon Hill and local relay TV transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Devon, Heart West, Greatest Hits Radio South West and Radio Exe.

The town is served by the local newspaper, Okehampton Times which publishes on Thursdays.

==Transport==
Okehampton&#x27;s location at the edge of the moor means that it has always been a route centre.

===Road===
The A30 trunk road gives fast access to the east and west.

After years of uncertainty, this trunk road was finally re-routed in 1988 to bypass the town, which had previously been a holiday traffic bottleneck on summer weekends.

===Rail===
Okehampton railway station is on the former northerly rail route from Exeter St Davids to Plymouth via Tavistock. The line from Exeter was kept open for freight traffic to and from Meldon Quarry, west of Okehampton. In 1997, Devon County Council revived a passenger rail service from Exeter, on summer weekends only, in an attempt to reduce motor traffic to the national park, which became a summer Sunday service, operated at its closure by Great Western Railway. In March 2010, the freight operator Devon &amp; Cornwall Railways announced plans to reinstate a daily passenger service terminating in Exeter, though this never came to fruition. The station was also previously served by heritage trains, but closed to all services in 2019.

Okehampton station then reopened to a regular service on 20 November 2021 as part of refurbishment of the line. The Dartmoor Line, as it is now called, opened with a two hourly service to Exeter St Davids which increased to hourly in Spring 2022.

In the wake of widespread disruption caused by damage to the mainline track at Dawlish by coastal storms in February 2014, leaving Plymouth and Cornwall with no rail connection to the rest of the country, Network Rail considered reopening the Exeter-to-Plymouth route via Okehampton and Tavistock.

===Bus services===
Okehampton is served by various bus services from Exeter, Bude, Newquay and Tavistock. Stagecoach South West service 6 links from Exeter bus station via Exeter St Davids to Okehampton. Other services from Exeter bus station include the 6A service via Exeter St Davids, which continues to Launceston.
Dartline run service 118 to Tavistock. There are also rural services operated by County Bus and MD Coaches.
There was formerly a town service numbered 318, but it was withdrawn in 2015.

===Coach excursions===
Lomax Tours run coach trips from Okehampton to various places of interest.

==Nearby settlements==
Except for the open country of Dartmoor to the south, Okehampton is surrounded by many smaller villages and towns. Notable examples are the villages of South Zeal with its ancient burgage plots, granite thatched cottages and Dartmoor Folk Festival; Belstone on the outskirts of Dartmoor; and Sticklepath which has an annual fire show on Bonfire Night, 5 November. Other nearby villages and settlements include Hatherleigh, North Tawton, Whiddon Down, Chagford, Bratton Clovelly, Lydford, Folly Gate, Southcott, Northlew, Jacobstowe, Bridestowe and Sourton.

<text>Saint Austell (, ; ) is a town in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom, south of Bodmin and west of the border with Devon.

At the 2021 census it had a population of 20,900.

==History==

St Austell was a village centred around the parish church, until the arrival of significant tin mining in the 18th century turned it into a town.

St Austell is named after the 6th-century Cornish saint, St Austol, a disciple of St Mewan. In a Vatican manuscript there is a 10th-century list of Cornish parish saints. This includes Austoll, which means that the church and village existed at that time, shortly after 900.

St Austell is not mentioned in Domesday Book (1086). However, A. L. Rowse, in his book &quot;St. Austell: Church, Town, and Parish&quot;, cites records which show a church was dedicated on 9 October 1262 by Bishop Bronescombe, and other records show a church there in 1169, dedicated to &quot;Sanctus Austolus&quot;. The current church dates from the 13th–14th centuries, and was extended in 1498–99. The join between the two sections is still visible.

In the time of Henry VIII, St Austell is described as a poor village. In John Leland&#x27;s &quot;Itinerary&quot; he says, in around 1542, &quot;&quot;. Neither travel writer, John Norden (c. 1547 – 1625) or Richard Carew (1555–1620) in his &quot;Survey of Cornwall&quot; mentioned St Austell as a place of any consequence. Oliver Cromwell granted a charter to hold a market on Friday, as a reward to a local gentleman who fought for him at the battle of Boconnoc.

The village started to grow in the 18th century. The nearby Polgooth mine became known as the greatest tin mine in the world. Around 1760 the Land&#x27;s End to Plymouth road went through the town. Along with William Cookworthy&#x27;s discovery of china clay at Tregonning Hill in west Cornwall, and the same mineral, found in greater quantity in Hensbarrow downs north of St Austell, the town became more prominent.

China clay mining soon took over from tin and copper mining as the principal industry in the area, and this eventually contributed enormously to the growth of the town. The china clay industry really only came into its own during the mid-19th to early 20th centuries, at a time when the falling prices of tin and other metals forced many mines to close down or convert to clay mining. The success and high profitability of the industry attracted many families whose breadwinner had been put out of work by the depression in the local metal mining industry, and increased the population of the town considerably. This meant that more shops and businesses took root, providing more jobs and improving trade. This, along with other factors, led to St Austell becoming one of the ten most important commercial centres of Cornwall.

The town was a noted centre of Methodism. By 1839 &quot;The West Briton&quot; recorded 37 non-conformist chapels in the town.

==Climate==
===Redevelopment===
Work began in 1963 on a brutalist-style pedestrian precinct which included shops, offices, and flats. The design was by Alister MacDonald &amp; Partners and the materials reinforced concrete with some stone facing.

In the 2000s this area of the town had become very outdated, and underwent a £75 million redevelopment process. In August 2007, developers David McLean and demolition team Gilpin moved onto the town centre site to complete the preparation, with the Filmcentre which was originally an Odeon cinema dating back to 1936, being demolished in late September/early October.

In October 2007, the South West of England Regional Development Agency (SWRDA) announced the new development would be named &quot;White River Place&quot;. It was also announced that 50% of shop units had been leased to High Street stores, with New Look, Peacocks, Bonmarché and Wilko opening new stores. This would mean New Look relocating from its current premises in Fore Street and the return of Peacocks to St Austell following the demolition of its old store to make way for the new development. Bonmarché, Peacocks and Wilko have since closed.

It was announced in October 2008 that the developer David McLean Developments had gone into administration and concern was expressed that this could jeopardise the completion of the project.

The new White River Cinema opened its doors in December 2008 for the first time: the cinema is technically advanced and the first purpose-built cinema in Cornwall for over 60 years. The Torchlight Carnival was revived in November 2009 as a direct result of public demand through a survey conducted with local residents. The Torchlight Procession has become an important event in the town&#x27;s calendar, heralding in the Winter celebrations and drawing thousands of people from across Cornwall and Devon. The event is run by a small group of non-affiliated volunteers.

The St Austell and Clay Country Eco-town is a plan for several new settlements around St Austell on old Imerys sites. It was given outline government approval in July 2009.

The Cornwall Council strategic planning committee voted in July 2011 to approve a £250 million beach resort scheme at Carlyon Bay, St Austell. The development was initially proposed in 2003.

==Governance==

The arms of St Austell are Argent a saltire raguly Gules.

===Parliamentary===
St Austell is in the parliamentary constituency of St Austell and Newquay which was created in 2010 by the Boundary Commission for England (increasing the number of seats in Cornwall from five to six). Before 2010 it was in the Truro and St Austell seat.

===Local government===
The main local authority is Cornwall Council, the unitary authority created as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England. The six former Districts and the former Cornwall County Council were abolished and replaced by Cornwall Council on 1 April 2009.

Also on 1 April 2009, four new parishes were created for the St Austell area. They are:
* &quot;St Austell Town Council&quot; covering Boscoppa, Bethel, Gover, Mount Charles, Poltair and Holmbush; represented by 20 councillors.
* &quot;Carlyon Parish Council&quot; covering Carlyon Bay and Tregrehan; represented by 9 councillors.
* &quot;St Austell Bay Parish Council&quot; covering Charlestown, Duporth, Porthpean and Trenarren; represented by 7 councillors.
* &quot;Pentewan Valley Parish Council&quot; covering Tregorrick, Trewhiddle, London Apprentice and Pentewan; represented by 9 councillors.

Before this date the area had been an unparished area.

==Economy==
St Austell is the main centre of the china clay industry in Cornwall and employs around 2,200 people , with sales of £195 million.

The St Austell Brewery, which celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2001, supplies cask ale to pubs in Cornwall and other parts of the country. Its flagship beer is &quot;St Austell Tribute&quot;; a number of other ales are brewed but are less commonly sold outside Cornwall. St Austell Brewery&#x27;s first public house, The Seven Stars Inn, purchased in 1863, still stands on East Hill in the town but has closed as a public house; the building is let by the Brewery at &#x27;minimal rent&#x27; to a charity providing an educational facility for young people. Tregonissey House, the site of the company&#x27;s first steam brewery, built in 1870, can also be seen in Market Hill. A brewery museum and visitor centre is open to the public on the present brewery site in Trevarthian Road.

===Tourism===
As in much of Cornwall and neighbouring counties, tourism is increasingly important to St Austell&#x27;s economy. Tourists are drawn to the area by nearby beaches and tourist attractions such as the Eden Project, sited in a former clay pit, and the Lost Gardens of Heligan. The China Clay Country Park, in a former china-clay pit north of the town, tells the story of the men, women and children who lived, worked and played in the shadow of the clay tips around St Austell.

St Austell is home to several public houses, numerous high street retailers, and several independent shops, many of which cater for tourists. The town has a small museum which is situated in St Austell Market House.

A Brewery Museum and Visitor Centre is situated on the site of the St Austell Brewery in Trevarthian Road.

===Newspaper and radio===
The town has two weekly newspapers:
* &quot;St Austell Guardian&quot;, part of the Cornish Guardian series published by Cornwall and Devon Media Ltd, has a long history in the town and is published on Friday.
* &quot;St Austell Voice&quot;, sister paper to the &quot;Newquay Voice&quot;, had offices close to the town centre in Truro Road, but has since moved to Old Vicarage Place. It is published on Wednesday.

Radio St Austell Bay is a local radio station which broadcasts from studios at Tregorrick Park. It launched in January 2008 to cover the area from Trewoon in the west to Tywardreath in the east.

==Landmarks==

Notable Cornish architect Silvanus Trevail designed a number of St Austell&#x27;s buildings and houses, including the Thin End and the Moorland Road terrace. Other notable architects from St Austell include John Goode, who contributed considerably during the 1970s to residential developments in the area.

Pevsner remarks in his guide to Cornwall that the following buildings are notable:
*The Parish Church
*The Old Market Hall, in Italian Renaissance style, 1844
*Friends Meeting House, 1829, a plain granite structure
*Masonic Hall, South Street, 1900 and is home to nine Masonic bodies
*White Hart Hotel: once contained panoramic wallpaper of the Bay of Naples by Dufour (now in the Victoria and Albert Museum)
*Holy Well at Menacuddle
*Three buildings of the 1960s: Penrice School, 1960; Public Library, 1961; former Magistrates&#x27; Court, 1966

==Media==
===Television===
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC South West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Caradon Hill and local relay TV transmitters.

===Radio===
Local radio stations are BBC Radio Cornwall on 95.2 FM, Heart West on 105.1 FM, and CHAOS Radio, a community based station which broadcast from the town on 105.6 FM.

===Newspapers===
The town is served by the local newspaper, St Austell Voice.

==Transport==

St Austell railway station was opened by the Cornwall Railway on 4 May 1859 on the hillside above the town centre. Two branch lines west of the town were later opened to serve the china clay industry; the Newquay and Cornwall Junction Railway which is still partly open, and the short-lived Trenance Valley line. The independent narrow gauge Pentewan Railway ran from West Hill to the coast at Pentewan. The Cornish Main Line in St Austell is quite renowned for its viaducts in the Gover Valley and Trenance areas of the town. The original timber structure was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, it was high, long on 10 piers; it was replaced by a stone viaduct in 1899.

There was a siding located west of the viaduct. In the early years trains from St Austell had to push wagons over the tall, curving viaduct to shunt this siding. The Great Western Railway&#x27;s instructions stated that: &quot;Trucks may be pushed from St Austell to the Siding, but when this is done the speed of the Train between the two places must not exceed 8 miles an hour, and the head Guard must ride on the leading vehicle, unless it be a bonnet end one, in which case he must ride in the first low sided vehicle from it, to keep a good look out, and be prepared to give a signal to the Driver either by Day or Night, as may be required&quot;. Train services today operate west to and , and east to and London. There are also CrossCountry services on most days to the North of England and Scotland.

The town&#x27;s bus station faces the entrance to the railway station to offer an easy interchange between buses and trains. National Express coach services call here, a dedicated link operates to the Eden Project, and local buses operate to villages such as Fowey and Mevagissey. The town can be accessed by the A390 which by-passes the town to the south on its way from Liskeard to Truro, or by the A391 from Bodmin, or by the A3058 from Newquay. In addition there are the B3273 to Mevagissey, the B3274 to Padstow and the A3082 to Fowey.

===St Austell bus station===

St Austell bus station is the main bus and coach terminus for the town. The bus station is located in the forecourt of the railway station, formerly a railway goods yard.

The bus station was redeveloped again in 2008, the new facility being opened on 3 November. It now comprises seven stands and shares facilities such as a taxi rank and buffet with the adjoining railway station which is operated by Great Western Railway, a sister company to the main local bus operator. Local services are provided by Go Cornwall and Kernow. Long-distance coach services are part of the National Express Coaches network.

====History====
The Great Western Railway started to operate what they called &#x27;road motors&#x27; from outside their railway station on 3 August 1908. These first services ran to St Columb Road via St Dennis.

A bus garage was later provided nearby in Eliot Road, next to the railway&#x27;s new goods yard. The network was progressively extended over the next twenty years, after which time the services were transferred to the Western National Omnibus Company, formed in 1929 to free the railway company from its bus services and avoid complaints about its transport monopoly. Western National has now become part of the FirstGroup and operates as Kernow.

==Education==
St Austell has three comprehensive schools, Poltair School, formerly the grammar school, and Penrice Academy; together with Brannel School which is situated in the nearby village of St Stephen-in-Brannel. Several of these are joining an academy trust called CELT (Cornwall Education and Learning Trust).

Cornwall College St Austell is a Further &amp; Higher Education institution incorporating the former St Austell Sixth Form Centre and Mid Cornwall College of Further Education. The college is based at John Keay House, which is also home to the college group&#x27;s headquarters.

There are a number of primary schools within the town.

==Health services==
St Austell has its own hospital, St Austell Community Hospital, formerly called Penrice Hospital.

==Religious sites==
The church was originally dedicated to St Austol, a Breton saint associated with St Meven, but is now dedicated to the Holy Trinity. By 1150 it had been appropriated to the Priory of Tywardreath by the Cardinhams: this continued until 1535. There was originally a Norman church here, of which some remains may be seen.

The present church is of the 15th century and is large because the mediaeval parish was also a large one: the tower is impressive. All four outside walls bear sculptural groups in carved niches: the Twelve Apostles in three groups on the north, east and south; the Holy Trinity above the Annunciation and below that the Risen Christ between two saints on the west. The tower can be dated to between 1478 and 1487 by the arms of Bishop Courtenay, and the walls are faced in Pentewan stone.

The tower and other parts of the church have an interior lining of granite On the south side of the church, a formerly separate chantry has been incorporated into the church when it was extended. (The chantry itself was abolished in 1543.)

There are holy wells at Menacuddle and Towan. A new organ was placed on the north side of the chancel in 1880 and the first recital was held on 22 April. The organ was built by Messrs Bryceson Brothers and Ellis and cost circa £600. The church is dedicated to the Holy Trinity, is Grade I listed, and seats 300. There is a Cornish cross in the churchyard which was found buried in the ground on the manor of Treverbyn in 1879. This cross was erected in the churchyard on a new base in 1879. Another cross is in the grounds of a house originally known as Moor Cottage. This house was built in 1819; the cross was brought from Hewas in the parish of Ladock.

The parish of St Austell was part of the archdeaconry of Cornwall and Diocese of Exeter until 1876 when the Diocese of Truro was established. A new rural deanery of St Austell was established in 1875. The style of worship of the parish church is in the Evangelical tradition of the Church of England. The two chapels-of-ease are All Saints, Pentewan, and St Levan&#x27;s, Higher Porthpean. In the 19th century the following parishes were created out of St Austell parish: St Blazey (1845); Charlestown (1846), Treverbyn (1847) and Par (1846 out of St Blazey and Tywardreath).

===Quakers===
There was formerly a Quaker burial ground at Tregongeeves, just outside the town on the Truro Road. It was covered by about of earth removed from the building of the new road in the 1960s. A high stone wall bounds the remaining acre of land; access can be gained through a wrought iron gate.

Approximately forty of the headstones from Tregongeeves were removed and are now located at the Friends meeting house in the High Cross Street in St Austell, just below the high wall which surrounds St Austell railway station. That meeting house is still in use.

==Sport==
===Cornish wrestling===
St Austell has been a major centre for Cornish wrestling for centuries.
The ancient traditional location for wrestling tournaments was the Bull Ring, behind the stables at the White Hart Inn.
Other places used for Cornish wrestling tournaments include:
* The Wrestling Downs was also a traditional place for wrestling tournaments, opposite Polkyth, that initially were built on in the 1930s making Tremayne Place. 
* Wrestling Green which was another traditional venue for wrestling tournaments, which was very close to the Wrestling Downs.
* Fairfield - located above St Austell station, opposite the library.
* Mount Charles - tournaments were held here in the 1800s and 1900s.
* St Austell football field - there were many tournaments held in the St Austell football field as soon as it was built. Note that this replaced the use of Fairfield (which is relatively close by).
* The Public Rooms were used for Cornish wrestling tournaments and challenge matches.
* West Hill School playing fields associated with West Hill School, were used for wrestling tournaments.

Many famous Cornish wrestlers came from St Austell including Jacob Halls, James Bullocke, Samuel Rundle, Joseph Menear, Philip Hancock and Thomas Stone. Others who were successful in Cornish wrestling in the United States include Thomas Eudy, John Tippett and John H Rowett.

St Austell was at one time well known for a couple of techniques:
* Hancock Slew: This was also spelt Slue. This throw was invented by Philip Hancock (who was from St Austell). It involves grasping the ropes of the jacket and using these to propel your opponent over your shoulder. It is a very dangerous throw and is now called the Flying Mare.
* Lock Arm: At the end of the 1800s the St Austell wrestlers were renowned for this throw, which involved locking the opponent’s arm with your arm, so as to make them vulnerable to a range of throws.

Currently there is a Cornish wrestling club, open to the public, which meets every Monday from 7pm to 9pm above the St Austell rifle club, by the football club opposite Poltair School.

===Speedway===
Speedway racing first took place a venue called Rocky Park, under the name &quot;St Austell Gulls&quot;. The sport was a hit during various years, between 1949 and 1963 at the Cornish Stadium. The sport returned to the area in the late 1990s, in the Clay Country Moto Parc, located at Old Pound, Nanpean.

The club operated as the St Austell Gulls for four years, until the club changed ownership, and moved up a league to the Premier League, re-formed as the Trelawny JAG Tigers, until site owners Imerys Minerals Ltd ended the lease. Speedway has not been held in Cornwall since. Many attempts have been made to re-introduce the sport, but none have got past planning permission. The two highest-profile bids were at Par Moor Motor Museum and St Eval Raceway. The owner of the land for the Par Moor bid confirmed that he would rent the land for speedway but locals objected. The St Eval bid failed after residents expressed fears about noise.

===Stock car racing===
Stock car racing, promoted by 1950s Kiwi Speedway star Trevor Redmond, ran side by side with speedway on numerous occasions. Numerous championships were run here, including the 1972 BriSCA World Championship for Formula 2 cars, won by Jimmy Murray from Northern Ireland. It closed its doors in 1987.

===Greyhound racing===
A greyhound racing track was also opened at the Cornish Stadium and traded from 1958 to 1986. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and was known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks.

===Football===
St Austell Football Club was formed on 17 September 1890. In 1908 the club won its first trophy: the Cornwall Charity Cup. The club achieved some success in the late 1920s and 1930s, winning the Senior Cup and Charity Cup twice. In May 2009, the team won the Senior Cup with a closely fought 3–2 victory over Saltash United.

===Rugby and tennis===
Tregorrick Park is the home of St Austell RFC, St Austell Tennis Club and Cornwall Table Tennis Centre. St Austell RFC play in the Tribute Western Counties West league and the club supports two senior teams, a ladies team and 14 youth teams covering most age groups. Founded in 1963 St Austell RFC has played at the Tregorrick Park ground since their move from Cromwell Road in the 1980s to make way for the Asda supermarket.

Tregorrick Park also hosts a gym, sports hall, squash courts, bar, function room and holds local events such as firework displays and schools cross country competitions.

===Cricket===
Wheal Eliza cricket ground is the home of St Austell Cricket Club, and is also used for Minor Counties matches. The club supports four senior teams, a ladies&#x27; team and youth teams. Facilities at Wheal Eliza includes two playing fields with their own changing room facilities enabling the club to hold two competitive matches every match day. The club also has a pavilion, scorebox, artificial and grass nets.

===Baseball===
In 2017, the St Austell Claycutters baseball club was established to compete in the South West Baseball League. While the team are named and associated with St. Austell, all outdoor training and home games are held on the sports fields at Fowey River Academy in Fowey.

===Golf===
There are three 18-hole golf courses located around St Austell; St Austell Golf Club, Carlyon Bay Golf Club, and Porthpean Golf Club. St Austell Golf Club is the only one that has a driving range as well as being the oldest of the three, being founded in 1911, with Carlyon Bay being designed a year later in 1912. There used to be a 9-hole course known as St Austell Bay but since 2014 this has been turned into a 36-hole football-golf course known as Cornwall Football Golf.

<doc id="374524" wikidata="Q1235885" url="?curid=374524" title="Seaton, Devon">
<text>Seaton () is a seaside town, fishing harbour and civil parish in East Devon on the south coast of England, between Axmouth (to the east) and Beer (to the west). It faces onto Lyme Bay and is on the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site. A sea wall provides access to the mostly shingle beach stretching for about a mile, and a small harbour on the River Axe estuary.

The population of Seaton parish at the 2011 census was 8,413, whilst the Seaton and Beer Urban Area (which includes Colyton) had an estimated population of 12,815 in 2012. There are 3,300 homes in the parish, of which approximately one third are of single-person occupancy. The majority of those persons are of pensionable age.

==History==

A farming community existed here 4,000 years before the Romans arrived, and there were Iron Age forts in the vicinity at Seaton Down, Hawkesdown Hill, Blackbury Camp and Berry Camp. During Roman times this was an important port although the town&#x27;s Roman remains have been reburied to preserve them. In Saxon times Seaton was known as &quot;Fluta&quot; or Fleet, the Saxon word for creek. The town of Fleet was founded by Saxon Charter in 1005 AD. The first mention of Seaton was in a papal bull by Pope Eugenius in 1146.

Seaton was an important port for several centuries, supplying ships and sailors for Edward I&#x27;s wars against Scotland and France. In the 14th century heavy storms caused a landslip which partially blocked the estuary, and the shingle bank started to build up. In 1868 the arrival of the railway reduced the use of the harbour.

In 2013 Laurence Egerton, a metal detector enthusiast, found a collection of some 22,000 copper-alloy Roman coins. The &quot;Seaton Down Hoard&quot; is one of the largest and best-preserved collections of 4th-century coins ever found in Britain.

The church on the edge of town was built in the 14th century, with a squat tower dating from the 15th century.

===Railway===
Seaton was served by the Seaton branch line, opened in 1868, from Seaton Junction on the Salisbury to Exeter main line. The railway was successful and considerably assisted in the development of Seaton as a holiday destination. The line had one of the world&#x27;s first concrete bridges, built over the River Axe in 1877.

With the increase in car ownership in the 1960s, usage of the line declined, and with many other Devon branch lines, it closed in 1966. The nearest railway station now is at Axminster, seven miles away.

Part of the trackbed was purchased in 1969 to construct Seaton Tramway, which opened in 1970 and links Seaton with Colyford and Colyton.

===Holiday resort===

In the 19th century Seaton developed as a holiday resort, which it remains to this day. A Warners holiday camp opened in 1935 close to the station, encouraged by the ease of travel. Seaton lost its largest holiday camp at the beginning of 2009.
Many of the town buildings are Victorian, including a notable collection of large houses at Seaton Hole, but the town also has notable buildings from the 1930s and later periods. Seaton Town Hall, now used as a theatre, was completed in 1904.

===Recent history===
The area to the east of the retail area to the River Axe (mainly floodplain) has been the subject of a regeneration plan formulated in 2003 and approved in detail in 2009, despite local opposition. As of early 2011, the level of the site has been raised above flood level using a million tons of sand brought in by sea. A large Tesco supermarket and filling station have been built on one half of this site: the other half is to be offered for residential development. A Jurassic Coast Discovery Centre has also been erected nearby, being completed in 2016. A further residential development is planned along the riverside.

As of October 2019 work has begun on a £200,000 skate-park.

==Transport==
Seaton is just off the A3052 road which starts at Exeter to the West and Lyme Regis to the East.

The Seaton Tramway runs frequent oldstyle tram services to Colyton between February and October, Christmas and New Year.

Seaton&#x27;s nearest railway station is at Axminster (around away) on the West of England line linking Exeter to London Waterloo.

Some of the bus services in the town are provided by &quot;AVMT Buses&quot; who run services to many of the nearby towns and villages including Axminster, Branscombe, Sidmouth, Colyton, Beer &amp; Lyme Regis. Stagecoach operates services to Exeter via Sidmouth and limited services to Exeter via Honiton, while Dartline operate limited services to Taunton which also run via Honiton.

Seaton is on route 2 of the National Cycle Network.

==Natural history==

=== Geology ===
The coastal cliffs either side of Seaton have long been of interest to geologists. To the East are the characteristically red-coloured cliffs of Triassic age rocks assigned to the Branscombe Mudstone Formation, capped by younger rocks (Cretaceous) of the Upper Greensand Formation and finally by chalk. The Seaton Fault, which is visible at Seaton Hole at the western end of the beach, is responsible for the presence of significant chalk cliffs extending to Beer Head. In common with much of this coast the cliffs in this area are prone to landslip and collapse, such movement restricting coastal development and presenting a hazard to those walking the coast.

===Wildlife===
The area around Seaton is rich in wildlife. The agricultural landscape supports areas of ancient woodland (often with displays of bluebells), important networks of hedges, unimproved grassland and springline mires.
Around Beer there are remnants of flower-rich chalk grassland, a rare habitat in Devon. The Axe Estuary, with its areas of grazing marsh, and the River Axe itself, are of international importance for their aquatic communities. To the east of the Axe lies the Axmouth to Lyme Regis Undercliffs National Nature Reserve. This large area of coastal landslides and cliffs supports important woodland and grassland habitats and is of considerable significance for its geology. To the west of the Axe is a series of nature reserves, collectively known as Seaton Wetlands and including Seaton Marshes, Black Hole Marsh, Colyford Common and Stafford Marsh. Between them, these reserves include freshwater grazing marshes, intertidal lagoons, scrapes, ditches and bird hides, and are host to a diverse variety of birds and mammals.

Eurasian otters are present on the River Axe, and at the end of 2009 are being seen regularly on Seaton marshes/Colyford Common. Dormice are present throughout the area. To the west, near Beer, are man-made caves of importance for a diversity of hibernating bats, including the very rare Bechstein&#x27;s bat. The Axe Estuary and its marshes are important for wintering wildfowl and waders, such as Eurasian curlew and common redshank, while in the summer butterflies and dragonflies abound. In 2007, an Audouin&#x27;s gull was seen here – the fourth British record of this bird.

==Attractions==
Seaton Tramway offers a ride through the Axe and Coly valleys to Colyford and Colyton. It runs alongside the Axe estuary, giving panoramic views of the nature reserves and the estuary wildlife.Seaton tram station, opened in 2018, includes a fully enclosed facility featuring a four track layout, Claude&#x27;s Diner and a gift shop.

Pecorama, west of Seaton at Beer, is a tourist attraction by the model railway manufacturer Peco. It includes the Beer Heights Light Railway and numerous model railway layouts.

On 26 March 2016 the Seaton Jurassic Centre opened in the town. This was a time travelling experience telling the story of the natural heritage of the Jurassic Coast past and present. The attraction closed in September 2021, but has a current planned reopening under the name Jurassic Discovery, now operated by Seaton Tramway. The soft play and cafe area opened at the new centre in March 2024 with the rest of the building planned to launch later in the year.

==Industry==
Its position next to floodplains and hemmed in by hills on either side means expansion is difficult and has hampered growth of local employment. In 2010 redevelopment of a large portion of the town commenced with new business sites providing a surge in non-seasonal employment.

==Media==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC South West and ITV West Country, received from the Stockland Hill TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Devon, Heart West, Greatest Hits Radio South West and East Devon Radio, a community based station. The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Midweek Herald&quot; which publishes on Wednesdays.

Between 1976 and 1990, the town was home to the Independent Broadcasting Authority&#x27;s Harman Engineering Training College, which trained broadcast engineers.

==Twin towns==
Seaton is twinned with Thury-Harcourt-le-Hom in France.

<doc id="374530" wikidata="Q1026673" url="?curid=374530" title="Ventnor">
<text>Ventnor () is a seaside resort town and civil parish established in the Victorian era on the southeast coast of the Isle of Wight, England, from Newport. It is situated south of St Boniface Down, and built on steep slopes leading down to the sea. The higher part is referred to as Upper Ventnor (officially Lowtherville); the lower part, where most amenities are located, is known as Ventnor. Ventnor is sometimes taken to include the nearby and older settlements of St Lawrence and Bonchurch, which are covered by its town council. The population is 5,567 according to the 2021 Census

Ventnor became extremely fashionable as both a health and holiday resort in the late 19th century, described as the &#x27;English Mediterranean&#x27; and &#x27;Mayfair by the Sea&#x27;. Medical advances during the early twentieth century reduced its role as a health resort and, like other British seaside resorts, its summer holiday trade suffered from the changing nature of travel during the latter part of the century.

Its relatively sheltered location beneath the hilly chalk downland and south-facing orientation towards the English Channel produces a microclimate with more sunny days and fewer frosts than the rest of the island. This allows many species of subtropical plant to flourish; Ventnor Botanic Garden is particularly notable.
==History==
While Bonchurch and St Lawrence both have churches dating back to the Norman era, the area in-between that became Ventnor was unremarkable until the 19th century. In Anglo-Saxon times it was known as &quot;Holeweia&quot;, which by the 12th century had become &quot;Holeweye&quot;, or hollow way (although possibly the name derived from the &quot;Holy Well&quot; spring on the downs). By 1617 its name appears as Ventnor, probably named after the family name &quot;le Vyntener&quot;.

There are indications of Bronze Age settlement, with burial mounds on the nearby downs, and excavations have evidenced small scale settlement in the area during both the Iron Age and the early Roman period. These include middens and palaeoenvironmental deposits at Binnel Bay, Woody Bay, St Catherine&#x27;s Point and Rocken End. The Isle of Wight was the last part of England to be converted to Christianity, and Saint Boniface is believed to have preached locally in the 8th century. During the 13th century, the area was covered by the manors of Holloway and Steephill, both belonging to the Lisle family.

A 1992 archaeological survey found evidence of a medieval settlement at Flowers Brook, which was referred to in a 1327 subsidy roll as &quot;Villata de steple&quot;. This area was subsequently incorporated into two farms, with some cottages on the site demolished in 1834. Ventnor watermill, on a site just north of the current cascade, is first mentioned in 1327, was destroyed by fire in 1848, rebuilt by 1853, and demolished in 1875.

In the early nineteenth century, in addition to the mill, Ventnor consisted solely of a few fishermen&#x27;s huts by the cove, a couple of inns, and a farm. In 1804, it was described by John Britton as a &quot;hamlet...formed by a range of neat cottages chiefly inhabited by fishermen, open to the sea in front, and backed by woods and the high downs&quot;. The area was divided between the parishes of Godshill and Newchurch. In 1820 both of the manors (Holloway was then known as Ventnor Manor) were sold to John Hamborough and other building speculators. The spur for expansion was the publication in 1830 of the second edition of physician James Clark&#x27;s book: &quot;The influence of climate on disease&quot;. This identified the microclimate of Ventnor and the Undercliff as ideal for people with chest complaints (&quot;nothing along the south coast will bear comparison with it&quot;, Clark enthused), at a time when consumption (now known as TB) was a common cause of death.
Thereafter Ventnor developed very rapidly into a town, with numerous hotels and boarding houses targeting sick visitors, particularly during the winter, and a wider range of shops than would be expected for a town of its size (by 1891 it had four chemists). In 1844 Parliament passed an Act &quot;for better paving, lighting, cleansing, and otherwise improving part of the parish of Newchurch, called Ventnor, and for establishing a market therein&quot;. However, not everyone was enamoured with the fast-growing town: in 1845, after recounting the positive reviews of others, writer John Gwilliam complained of the &quot;intolerable&quot; summer heat and the chalk dust about the town, concluding that to live there would &quot;be one of the greatest punishments that could be inflicted upon me in the Isle of Wight&quot;.

In 1853 the first newspaper on the island, the &quot;Ventnor Mercury&quot;, was launched (it continued publication until 1985). In 1869 Dr Arthur Hill Hassall opened the &quot;Royal National Hospital for Diseases of the Chest&quot; in St Lawrence, and many local buildings date from the 1860s, by when the current commercial centre of the town was already substantially developed. The later nineteenth century also saw development aimed at wealthier holidaymakers from Britain and Europe, as British seaside resorts generally became very popular.
The first pier from 1860 was washed away. Breakwaters were built in 1863, and by the following year, a steamer service to Littlehampton connected with trains to London. In 1866 the Isle of Wight Railway reached Ventnor, and in 1870 the iron Royal Victoria Pier was constructed. Subsequent storm damage delayed the full establishment of steamer services until 1888 when they were carrying 10,000 passengers from Bournemouth, Southsea, Sandown and Shanklin. The railway ran a non-stop train from Ryde to Ventnor, named &#x27;The Invalid Express&#x27; for the consumptive patients; one train famously completed the journey in a little over twenty minutes. Ventnor became known as &#x27;Mayfair by the sea&#x27; for the number of wealthy Londoners who were visiting. In 1887, &quot;Bartholomew&#x27;s Gazetteer&quot; described Ventnor as &quot;one of the most popular of English health resorts&quot;, with the parish then having a population of 5,739.

By the early twentieth century, Ventnor was a flourishing resort town, with several newspapers, a scientific institute, an extensive library, assembly room, pavilion, various sporting clubs, several churches, an annual regatta and carnival, and a new municipal park. In 1901 its population exceeded 6,000.

The physical fabric of the town was not affected by the First World War, although local businesses suffered from the suspension of the summer and winter resort trade, and its war memorial commemorates the local men who died in the fighting. Ventnor and St Lawrence became receiving centres for wounded soldiers. The summer holiday visitors returned in the 1920s, although the winter health trade never resumed. The town reached its zenith in the 1930s when steam packets operated between Southsea and the town&#x27;s pier. The Art Deco Winter Gardens opened in 1936/7. The relatively small sandy beach was ideal for bathing, and Victorian era hotels in the town&#x27;s suburbs and near the sea, such as the Ventnor Towers Hotel, remained popular with tourists.
During World War II, the Isle of Wight became a heavily defended restricted area. The radar station at RAF Ventnor was attacked several times during 1940, and the town itself was also bombed, and again in 1942. By the end of the war 120 buildings in the town had been destroyed and nearly 1,500 damaged, with sixteen fatalities. The holiday trade disappeared and was slow to return during post-war austerity. Nevertheless, by the early 1950s the number of tourists warranted 46 trains scheduled to run between Ventnor and Ryde every summer Saturday.

By the 1960s, the British seaside holiday was facing competition from cheap foreign package tours and the rising popularity of motoring. The railway line to Ventnor West closed in 1952 and to Ventnor station in 1966. The pier, damaged by fire and the elements, had fallen into disuse and was finally dismantled in the 1990s. By the 1980s, according to author Michael Freeman: &quot;The town entered the twilight era that characterised so many English seaside places...[with] crumbling public facilities, boarded up shops, faded lodging houses and hotels, not to mention unemployment&quot;. During more recent years, there have been some signs of a renaissance, as its strongly Victorian character came back into fashion, with development of the Haven, re-opening of the Winter Gardens, some new shops and restaurants, a lively cultural scene, and the growth in short break travel.

==Governance==

Ventnor is within the Isle of Wight East parliamentary constituency, with local services provided by the unitary Isle of Wight Council. Ventnor comprises part of two of the council&#x27;s thirty nine wards, with &quot;Wroxall, Lowtherville and Bonchurch&quot; taking in the very eastern side of the town, as well as Bonchurch and Upper Ventnor, and &quot;Ventnor and St Lawrence&quot; covering the town centre and western part of the town, including the Esplanade, as well as St Lawrence. Prior to 1974, the town had its own Urban District Council (formed in 1894), merged into South Wight District Council during that year, as a second tier beneath the Isle of Wight County Council. The district council was abolished in 1995 when the unitary authority for the island was created. Since 1994, a conservation area has covered much of the central area of the town.

Ventnor has a town council that manages various local services, including the park, four car parks, public toilets, and allotments. The Council is responsible for local byelaws, and is consulted by the Isle of Wight Council on matters such as planning and transport. The Town Council has eleven councillors covering four wards, with Ventnor West having six of the councillors, plus separate wards for Bonchurch &amp; Ventnor East, Lowtherville, and St Lawrence. Its coat of arms, displayed on welcome signs by roads into the town, shows Hygeia, the ancient Greek goddess of health, adopted in 1890 to reference its importance as a health resort, surrounded by wild roses referencing the garden isle.

The &#x27;Our Place&#x27; project in 2014, led by the Town Council working with residents and local public and private sector providers, identified the priorities for the town as being improved health and wellbeing, a renewed and refreshed economy, and enhanced community capacity. The Council&#x27;s Strategy Plan, developed in 2016 against the background of reduced funding from Isle of Wight Council for local services and the transfer of new responsibilities to the Town Council, focuses on the need for community inclusiveness, co-operation, influence and sustainability, in order to build the capacity to respond effectively to economic and social challenges.

==Geography==
Ventnor is on the south-east coast of the Isle of Wight, an island in the English Channel about off the coast of Hampshire, at . It is by road south-south-east of the island&#x27;s county town Newport, and about south-west of London. Its coastline is dominated by cliff scenery, with the town rising up the steep south-facing terraces between Ventnor Bay and St Boniface Down, which, at , is the highest point on the island. The town itself extends from the seashore up to the slopes of the downs, with its commercial centre being above sea-level; the urban area is contiguous with the neighbouring settlements of St Lawrence to the west and Bonchurch to the east.


There are nearby Sites of Special Scientific Interest at Ventnor Downs, St Lawrence Bank, Rew Down, and the Bonchurch Landslips, as well as the coast west of the town that forms part of the island&#x27;s largest SSSI between Steephill Cove and Compton Chine. The downs are part of the Isle of Wight Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Ventnor beach is one of the island&#x27;s principal if smaller beaches; there are also small beaches at Bonchurch and Steephill. The Isle of Wight Coastal Path runs through Ventnor. The town has no river, although there are tufa-depositing springs along the downs feeding streams that flow the short distance to the sea, such as one through Cascade Gardens, and another through the park that becomes Flowers Brook.

The tides along the coast are strong, with a tidal range of around . Three miles off the coast, there is a parallel ridge under the sea rising to within of the surface; tidal flows forced between it, and the island have carved out a deep channel known as &#x27;St Catherine&#x27;s Deep&#x27;. Offshore there are 71 recorded sites of shipwrecks, and three air wrecks classified as Military Remains Protected Places. The notable Clarendon wreck occurred just along the coast near Blackgang Chine in 1836, which prompted the building of St Catherine&#x27;s lighthouse.

The local coastline needs active shoreline management, with one of the longest stretches of naturally-developing soft cliffs along the British coast. Many are now protected by rock armour, large grey boulders imported from Somerset, or east of Ventnor by concrete tetrapods, all part of a £1.6 million programme of sea defence work completed in the 1990s. The coast here is also part of the South Wight Maritime Special Area of Conservation, with subtidal reefs that provide important habitats for marine species.

Ventnor is the seventh largest town on the Isle of Wight, with a population of just under 6,000. The nearest town is Shanklin, nearly four miles to the north-east, and the nearest villages are Whitwell and Wroxall, both less than distant.

==Geology==
 The local geomorphology defines the town. The Isle of Wight has complex geology of folded layers of sedimentary rocks (Greensand, chalk, and Gault clay), with Ventnor itself situated on the Undercliff, which is the largest urban landslide complex in North West Europe. According to the council&#x27;s Shoreline Management Plan, the &quot;medium to high sandstone, clay or chalk debris cliffs...are important for their geomorphological, ecological and entomological interest&quot;.

A significant area is built on the Gault clay, known locally as &#x27;blue slipper&#x27;, which when saturated allows the rocks above to suffer from landslip. The ground is notoriously unstable, and there are indications that the area is becoming less stable as the support provided by the lower slopes is slowly eroded.

The Shoreline Management Plan aims to protect the shoreline from erosion that would otherwise reactivate relic landslides along the Undercliff. The council believes that cliff protection works at Wheelers and Monks Bays &quot;appear to have significantly reduced the occurrences of landslide re-activations&quot;. Nevertheless, the periodic movement has destroyed buildings over the years, led to cracking of local roads, and disrupted utilities. In 2011 a vent opened at the former bus stop in Ocean View Road. A nearby Site of Special Scientific Interest is known as the Landslip. In 2014, after storms and heavy rain, a landslip caused the road between Ventnor and Niton to collapse.

The local area is an important one for fossils; the Compton Chine to Steephill Cove SSSI is a nationally important site with notable invertebrate assemblages.

==Climate==
Ventnor and the Isle of Wight have a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. The Met Office maintains a weather station at Ventnor Park. Because of its coastal location, Ventnor currently holds the British record for the warmest night for the month of June: in 1976.

According to the Tourist Board, the Isle of Wight is one of the sunniest places in the UK. Ventnor competes with Eastbourne to be considered the sunniest, both with about 1888 hours of sunshine per year, and averaging five hours of sun a day, peaking at eight hours during the summer. The town is sheltered from north winds behind St Boniface Down, and consequently has its own microclimate. This enables the Botanic Garden to grow species that would not survive outside elsewhere in the UK.

==Wildlife==
The climate and habitats in Ventnor support species that are rare in the UK, including some that are particularly associated with warmer and more southerly locations and are not established in much of the rest of the country. The town has the largest and oldest British colony of common wall lizards; whether these are a relict native population or were released in the 1920s is debated. A wall specially designed as a habitat has been built at the Botanic Garden, and small tunnels for the lizards installed beneath a local road.

The Isle of Wight is one of the principal British refuges of the once ubiquitous UK red squirrel population. They are relatively shy and most likely seen in wooded areas away from the town.

Ventnor downs support a small herd of feral goats, introduced in 1993 to control the growth of holm oak trees, and managed by the National Trust. Although not native to the UK, holm oak was introduced from the Mediterranean; the Victorians planted it widely in Ventnor, which has the largest holm oak wood in Northern Europe. This is described in the Isle of Wight Biodiversity Action Plan as a &quot;remarkable and extensive area of recent secondary woodland&quot;, and is gradually becoming colonised by other Mediterranean species including large white helleborine, yellow birds nest, the large fungus Amanita ovoidea, and the oak rustic moth. The holm oak stabilises the land, but is invasive, its further spread limited by the goats.

The only significant remaining UK population of Glanville fritillary butterfly, one of Britain&#x27;s rarest, is found along the southern coast of the Isle of Wight including Ventnor. According to the National Trust, the &quot;downland above the town is immensely rich and important for butterflies... of top national importance&quot;. The coastal downs west of Ventnor are also one of few locations in the UK where Field Cow-wheat can be found.

Early gentian can be found on Rew Down, just north-west of the town. It is a rare species in the UK first recorded in 1883 at this site and recognised as internationally important by EU Habitats Directives. This down is also noted for pyramidal orchids and the once-endangered adonis blue butterfly.

Ventnor&#x27;s subtidal reefs provide important habitats for marine species, for some of which the Isle of Wight is the eastern limit of distribution, representing the transition zone between the Gulf Stream from the south-west and cooler North Sea waters. These include the rare seaweed Gracilaria bursa-pastoris (or shepherd’s purse seaweed). The local coastline attracts bottlenose dolphin, basking shark and other cetaceans, as well as being an important area for fish species, including rays.

=== Ventnor Botanic Garden ===

Ventnor Botanic Garden was founded in 1970 by Sir Harold Hillier and occupies the 22-acre site of the former Royal National Hospital for Chest Diseases. The warm and sunny microclimate allows plants that are usually too tender for mainland Britain to grow. Its collection comprises worldwide temperate and subtropical trees and shrubs, organised by region, notably from Australia and New Zealand but also from Japan and the Mediterranean. Plants nevertheless have to be selected to tolerate the shallow alkaline soil and salt winds. 
Echium pininana is a tall species of flowering plant in the borage family Boraginaceae, native to La Palma in the Canary Islands, but grown in the Botanic Garden and in local gardens.

The Garden has a temperate house, and a visitor centre renovated in 2001. The Garden claims to be Britain&#x27;s hottest garden and to have developed the &#x27;Ventnor Method&#x27;, presenting plants in association with each other as they are seen in the wild. Its species of puya plants from the Andes are part of the National Plant Collection, and almost unique in Britain for being grown outdoors. Its Palm Court was planted in the late 19th century, and some of the current trees may be the originals.

==Demography==

Having passed 6,000 by the turn of the 20th century, Ventnor&#x27;s population peaked at over 7,300 in the early 1950s. According to UK census data, the population of Ventnor parish was 6,257 in 2001 and 5,976 in 2011, with a 2016 ONS estimate of 5,837, indicating a trend of declining population of just under 0.5% per year. With an area of , the population density in 2016 was . 51.7% of the population is female, with 16% aged 0–17 years, 53% aged 18–64, and 31% aged 65 or over. Mosaic analysis of the 2011 census classified 27% of Ventnor East and 39% of Ventnor West households as &quot;active elderly people living in pleasant retirement locations&quot;, with 46% of East and 20% of West as &quot;residents of small and mid-sized towns with strong local roots&quot;.

===Population===
In March 2011, Ventnor parish had 2,846 occupied households, each containing an average of 2.1 people, 66% being houses (detached 29%, semi-detached 22%, terraced 15%) and 34% flats (18% purpose built, 14% conversions, 2% in commercial buildings). However, there were a further 733 household spaces (about 20% of the total) with no residents on the 2011 census day. Of the households, 43% owned their home outright, 23% owned with a mortgage or loan, 20% were private rented, and 12% social rented. 26% had no car in the household.

Of residents aged at least 16 in 2011, 47% were married, 27.5% single and never married, 13.1% divorced, 9.7% widowed, 2.5% separated, and 0.2% in a same-sex civil partnerships. 57.7% were living as a couple, and 42.3% were not. 94.3% had been born in the UK (91.5% in England, 1.4% in Scotland, 1.2% in Wales and 0.2% in Northern Ireland), with 0.6% born in Ireland, 2.1% in the rest of the EU, and 3.0% elsewhere. 24.3% had no passport.

===Age===

In 2011 the average age of Ventnor residents was 47.3 years, compared with averages of 44 years for the island and 39 for England. The age distribution was as follows:
===Ethnicity===
==Economy==

The English Indices of Deprivation 2010 identified the central area of Ventnor as being one of the 20% most deprived areas, with the economy dependent on low paid seasonal work from tourism, and challenges from child poverty, inadequate housing, and relatively high levels of disability and ill health. The 2015 Indices suggest that this relative position has worsened, with Lowtherville closer to falling into the 20%. In the sub-domains, central Ventnor scored particularly badly for employment, and Lowtherville for children in poverty. 9% of households in Ventnor East are without central heating, compared to an English average of 2.7%. An analysis published in 2014 suggests that the average annual income in Ventnor, at £27,978, is the lowest of any sub-area on the island.

Of the population aged 16–74, on census day 2011 24% were working full-time, 14% part-time, 16% self-employed, 5% unemployed, 5% studying, 4% looking after home or family, 6% long-term sick or disabled, and 24% retired. The most common occupational categories were health and social (15%), wholesale and retail (14%), accommodation and food servicing (14%), and education (11%). However, of those in employment, 64% worked full-time and 36% part-time.

The town has many hotels and cafés, open seasonally to support the tourist trade. The main retail centres are the town centre (principally the High Street and Pier Street) and the Esplanade. There is an industrial estate on the site of the former station in Upper Ventnor, and a local shellfish industry near the Haven. Ventnor also has a small shipbuilding company.

Regarding its retail sector, an IOW Council Retail Assessment (based on a 2009 health check) concluded: &quot;Although the town has a good mix of local and tourist focussed retail and leisure provision, the high level of vacant units and charity shops gives the impression of a poor quality of retail provision. It suffers from a relative lack of public transport accessibility.&quot; It recommended that &quot;planning policies focus on protecting...local convenience and specialist comparison goods, such as antiques and vintage items&quot;.

==Arts and culture==

Ventnor is recognised as having a lively arts scene for a town of its size, with several annual arts events, venues for theatre and independent film, and active arts clubs.

Ventnor Fringe Festival has been held annually since 2010. This is an open arts festival taking place in venues across the town, similar to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe on a smaller scale. Previous acts include Liam Bailey and Johnny Flynn as well as theatre companies such as Paines Plough. The Fringe coincides with the Ventnor Carnival and, since 2012, the Isle of Wight Film Festival.

Ventnor Carnival is a traditional town carnival, held in the middle of August, with carnival floats, marching bands and drinking. The carnival started in 1889 and claims to be the second oldest carnival in the UK. From 2016 there has been an annual &quot;Ventnor Day&quot; to celebrate the town, since 2017 organised on the same day as the Round the Island Race, with music, entertainment and stalls promoting local community groups.

Between 2005 and 2008, Ventnor hosted the Isle of Wight International Jazz Festival, with headline acts including Maceo Parker, Humphrey Lyttelton and Cleo Laine. Between 2011 and 2016, Isle of Arts was an annual festival held in the town, with acts including Rich Hall, Sandi Toksvig, Alan Davies and Phill Jupitus. Isle of Arts ended after 2016, because of the costs of the event. However the range of the Ventnor Fringe has since been expanded, and now runs concurrently with the Ventnor International Festival, with acts visiting from around the world.

Ventnor does not have a mainstream cinema, but there is a local film club that arranges showings of international films. There have also been outdoor film screenings during the summer Fringe. Ventnor Arts Club occupies a former bank in the town centre, and arranges live broadcasts of opera, ballet and theatre performances as well as music events.

Each July, Isle of Wight Arts holds a free open studios event across the island, with a wide range of local artists and craftspeople opening their homes and studios to the public.

== Landmarks ==

Ventnor&#x27;s landmarks arise from its natural environment, its Victorian heritage, and its tourist appeal past and present. Although modest in altitude at , the chalk St Boniface Down is north of the town. The downs have a thick layer of acid flint gravels, with dry heathland vegetation. The town&#x27;s small beach of reddish chert sand and pebbles of flint and chert, with Ventnor Haven to the east and the prominent Spyglass Inn at its western end, will be familiar to many visitors. It is backed by an esplanade, which was created in 1848, now fronted by pubs, cafes, shops and restaurants. The gnomon on the esplanade was presented to the town by Sir Thomas Brisbane in 1851. At its eastern end is Ventnor&#x27;s pumping station, a £14 million project completed in 2002 as part of &#x27;Shifting Sands&#x27;, a joint initiative between English Heritage and the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment. It is disguised as a bandstand and viewing platform.

Just west of the beach is the Ventnor sign on the cliffs at La Falaise, with the town&#x27;s name in white concrete blocks. It was erected between the wars and intended to provide a landmark visible from the sea, replacing the chalk letters that were damaged in 1992. Just along the coastal path is Flowers Brook, a stream flowing through a small coastal meadow and recreation ground. In 2015 the meadow was earmarked for the coastal substation of a tidal energy generation scheme, but the scheme was suspended in 2017. A short distance further west is Steephill Cove, a hamlet and small beach that is inaccessible to motor vehicles, which has cafes and self-catering cottages.

Ventnor Park, on the western side of town, was awarded &#x27;Park of the Year&#x27; at the 2016 South and South East England in Bloom Awards. It has a bandstand, small aviary and stream, a putting green open seasonally, outdoor gym, and live music on Sunday afternoons during the summer. The land was originally owned by the Hambrough family, and leased to the town in the 1880s. Other public open spaces include Cascade Gardens, with its former mill stream and small waterfall, which were laid out in 1903. Below is a paddling-pool on the esplanade with a model of the Isle of Wight that children can play on.

RAF Ventnor is a former radar monitoring station atop St Boniface Down, and is now used for civilian and air traffic communications antennae. It also contains bunkers that were part of an early warning network, later converted into nuclear shelters during the Cold War as part of the ROTOR programme, now sealed and inaccessible. There is a memorial plaque nearby at the site of the 1962 Channel Airways Dakota accident, after which new regulations were introduced to improve air passenger safety.

Ventnor Exchange is an arts centre that opened in 2014 in the old Post Office building on Church Street. It organises the annual Ventnor Fringe Festival, supports emerging artists, and runs creative workshops for young actors, artists and writers. The winter gardens is an Art Deco building, dating from 1936, which was designed as a result of a competition in 1935 and built on the site of the vicarage. It was closed in 2011, then refurbished and re-opened as a cafe/restaurant and entertainment venue in 2014.

Along the coast, other notable landmarks include Blackgang Chine, the UK&#x27;s oldest theme park, which opened in 1843. Its first attraction, still on display, was the skeleton of a whale washed up on an island beach the following year, The powerful lighthouse of St Catherine&#x27;s is five miles away, at the southernmost tip of the island.

Ventnor Town Hall survives but was converted into flats in 1994.

== Transport ==
Surrounded by hills, with no railway connection, no roads within the County&#x27;s Strategic Road Network, and only two year-round bus routes connecting to other towns, Ventnor is relatively isolated from the rest of the island.

===Access by road===

Historically Ventnor was difficult to reach by road, along narrow and steep tracks. In the mid-nineteenth century the three routes were, from the east, through Bonchurch via the steep White (now Bonchurch) Shute, from the north, via Old Shute described by Michael Freeman as &quot;a precipitous descent&quot;, and from the west by a steep shute connecting Whitwell with St Lawrence. The modern routes respectively via the Leeson Road, Ocean View Road, and Whitwell Road, as well as the route to Niton along the Undercliff (closed to vehicles since 2014 following a landslip) were all created in the later nineteenth century.

===History of the railway===
 Railways reached the town in 1866 from Shanklin and Wroxall, and in 1900 from Merstone and Godshill. Ventnor railway station was the terminus of the Isle of Wight Railway (later the Island Line), and it brought many visitors to the town. Ventnor West railway station was the terminus of the Isle of Wight Central Railway from Cowes through Newport. Both stations suffered from being away from the town centre, requiring an onward road journey for travellers.

Ventnor West station was closed in 1952, before the closures ordered by Dr Beeching. Ventnor Station was closed in 1966, as part of a plan that also saw the remaining Ryde-Shanklin line electrified. Thereafter the town suffered economic decline from which it has not fully recovered. More recently the local MP has asked about the feasibility of extending the Island Line to Ventnor.

Between 2004 and 2010 a &#x27;rail link&#x27; bus by Wightbus ran from St Lawrence and Ventnor to Shanklin, facilitating the journey to and from Ventnor.

===Bus services===
Southern Vectis run buses on route 3 and 6 from Ventnor to destinations including Newport, Ryde, Sandown, Shanklin and Niton. Additionally Island Minibus service run the local number 31 route which connects Ventnor to Bonchurch Village, the Botanic Garden and esplanade. Previously operated by Wightbus, the link to the esplanade was restored in 2011 after many years, despite suggestions that this would be impractical.

===Pedestrianisation===

As of 2018, the Town Council is consulting about the possibility of pedestrianising part of the High Street and/or the Esplanade.

== Education ==
Education on the Isle of Wight is provided by local education authority-maintained schools, and independent schools. As a rural community, many of these schools are small, with average numbers of pupils lower than in many urban areas. In 2011 schools in the Isle of Wight were re-organised from a three-tier to a two-tier primary and secondary system, with pupils at state schools changing schools at age eleven. The former Middle Schools were closed.

Ventnor now has one secondary, one primary and one special school:

* The Island Free School (secondary);
* St Francis Catholic and CofE Primary School Academy;
* St Catherine&#x27;s School, a special school for pupils with speech and language difficulties.

Of the adult population in 2011, 25% had no qualifications, slightly higher than the English average of 22%. 24% had degree-level qualifications, compared to 27% in England.

Ventnor&#x27;s library was founded as the Ventnor and Bonchurch Literary and Scientific Institution in 1848, moving into its current building in the High Street two years later. It has been part of the county library service since 1940. Nearly a third of residents are active members of the library, which also offers a music collection and open access computers, and a venue for both educational and cultural events.

The town has a small heritage centre and museum, in a local shop purchased by the Local History Society in 1987. The museum&#x27;s collection and archive documents Ventnor&#x27;s growth and popularity during Victorian times.

==Religious sites==

 Ventnor has churches of several Christian denominations. St Catherine&#x27;s Church is one of two Church of England parish churches, dating from 1837 and financed by John Hamborough. The other is Holy Trinity Church, dating from 1860-2, which is constructed in a Gothic Revival style with a tall spire. The cost of building Holy Trinity was met by three sisters who disliked the evangelical nature of the original parish church. There is also a third Church of England place of worship, St Alban&#x27;s, which is anglo-catholic and was built in 1923.

Our Lady and St Wilfrid&#x27;s Catholic Church, dating from 1871, was destroyed by fire in 2003 and rebuilt in 2015.
There is also a Baptist Church in the town centre, opened in 1875. The Methodist community meets in the hall of the Catholics.

In the 2011 census, just under 60% of the population defined themselves as Christian, about 30% as having no religion, with about 9% declining to answer and very few people identifying with other religions.

==Sport and recreation==
Ventnor Cricket Club has several active teams, and plays on its ground just east of the Botanic Garden. Its pitch is unusual in that it is not flat but situated in a bowl, rising toward the boundaries. This has prevented them in being promoted beyond Division Two in the Southern Premier Cricket League.

Ventnor Rugby Club runs two men&#x27;s teams, and plays at its ground west of the town on the Whitwell Road.

Ventnor Football Club is adjacent to the rugby club, with the grounds housing the Ventnor Men’s &amp; Rew Valley youth teams.

There is a riding school and equestrian centre north of Ventnor on the road to Godshill.

<text>Votians, also referred to as Votes, Vots and Vods (, &quot;vađđalaizõd&quot;; ; ; ) are a Finnic ethnic group native to historical Ingria, the part of modern-day northwestern Russia that is roughly southwest of Saint Petersburg and east of the Estonian border-town of Narva. The Finnic Votic language spoken by Votians is close to extinction. The language is still spoken in three villages of historical Votia and by an unknown number of speakers in the countryside. The villages are &quot;Jõgõperä&quot; (Krakolye), &quot;Liivcülä&quot; (Peski), and &quot;Luuditsa&quot; (Luzhitsy). In the Russian 2020 census, 99 people identified as Votian.

Votians were one of the founding people of Veliky Novgorod.

==History==

Votians are the oldest known ethnic group in Ingria. They are probably descended from an Iron-age population of north-eastern Estonia and western Ingria. Some scholars claim they were a tribe of Estonians, who developed a separate identity during isolation from other Estonians. It is speculated the ancient Estonian county of Vaiga got its name from Votians. The Kylfings, a people active in Northern Europe during the Viking Age, may have been Votes.

The earliest literary references to the Votes by their traditional name are from medieval Russian sources, where Votes are referred to as &quot;Voď&quot;. Older Russian sources grouped them (under the name Chudes) with Estonians. Lake Peipus near the Votian homelands is called &quot;Chudsko ozero&quot;, meaning &quot;Lake of Chudes&quot; in Russian.
In 1069, the Votes were mentioned taking part in an attack on the Novgorod Republic by the Principality of Polotsk. Eventually Votes became part of the Novgorod Republic, and in 1149 they were mentioned taking part in an attack by Novgorod against &quot;&quot;, who are speculated to be peoples of Tavastia. One of the administrative divisions of Novgorod, &quot;Voch&#x27;skaa&quot;, was named after Votes. After the collapse of Novgorod in the 1470s, the Grand Principality of Moscow deported many Votes from their homelands, and began more aggressive conversion of them. Missionary efforts started in 1534, after Novgorod&#x27;s archbishop Macarius complained to Ivan IV that Votes were still practicing their pagan beliefs. Macarius was authorized to send monk Ilja to convert the Votes. Ilja destroyed many of the old holy shrines and worshipping places. Conversion was slow and the next archbishop had to send priest Nikifor to continue Ilja&#x27;s work. Slowly Votes were converted and they became devoted Christians.

Sweden controlled Ingria in the 17th century, and attempts to convert local Orthodox believers to the Lutheran faith caused some of the Orthodox population to migrate elsewhere. At the same time many Finnish peoples immigrated to Ingria. Religion separated the Lutheran Finns and Estonians and the Orthodox Izhorians and Votes, so intermarriage was uncommon between these groups. Votes mainly married other Votes, or Izhorians and Russians. They were mostly trilingual in Votic, Ingrian and Russian. In 1848, the number of Votes had been 5,148, (Ariste 1981: 78), but in the Soviet Russian census of 1926 there were only 705 left. From the early 20th century on, the Votic language no longer passed to following generations. Most Votes were evacuated to Finland along with Finnish Ingrians during World War II, but were returned to the Soviet Union following the September 1944 Moscow Armistice.

As a distinct people, Votes have become practically extinct after Stalinist dispersion to distant Soviet provinces as &#x27;punishment&#x27; for alleged disloyalty and cowardice during World War II. Expellees allowed to return in 1956 found their old homes occupied by Russians. In 1989, there were still 62 known Votes left, with the youngest born in 1930. There were 73 self-declared Votes in the 2002 Russian census. Of them 12 lived in St. Petersburg, 12 in Leningrad Oblast and 10 in Moscow. In 2008 Votes were added to the list of Indigenous peoples of Russia, granting them some support to preserving their culture. There have been some conflicts with Votic villagers and foresters, and in 2001 the Votic museum was burned in the village of Lužitsõ. Another possible problem is a port which is being constructed to Ust-Luga. It is planned that some 35,000 people would move near historic Votic and Izhoran villages.

==Votes in Latvia==
The Votes in Latvia were called &quot;krieviņi&quot; in Latvian. The word comes from &quot;krievs&quot;, which means &quot;Russian&quot;. Historical sources indicate the Teutonic Knights led by Vinke von Overberg captured many people in Ingermanland during their attack there in 1444–1447, and moved them to Bauska, where a workforce was needed to build a castle. It is estimated that some 3,000 people were transferred there. After the castle was built, the Votes did not go back, but were settled in the vicinity of Bauska and became farmers. Gradually, they forgot their own language and customs and were assimilated by the neighboring Latvians. They are first mentioned in literature of 1636. The first &quot;modern&quot; scientist to study them was Finnish Anders Johan Sjögren, but the first person to connect them with Votes was Ferdinand Johan Wiedemann in 1872. Latvian poet Jānis Rainis had some Votic roots.

Some modern people in Latvia around Bauska, with historic Krevinian ancestry still wish to identify with Votians and there has been new interest in Votian culture among them. There also exists a Votic museum in Latvia.

== Votes in Estonia ==
Votians used to live largely within the Narva region. Votes largely mixed with the Estonians, there exists information about Christians called &quot;poluverniki&quot; &#x27;half believers&#x27;, who mixed Orthodoxy and Lutheranism, this form of Christianity was practiced due to Orthodox Votians mixing with the Lutheran Estonians. Paul Ariste found that the Votic language influenced many Northern Estonian dialects.

Today Estonia still has Votian cultural events in Narva.

==Culture==

Historically most Votes were farmers. Slash and burn (&quot;sardo&quot;) was practiced until the early 20th century. Cattle, horses and geese were the most important livestock. Some made their living from fishing. Many primitive fishing habits survived a long time in Votic communities, such as fishing with a club or spear. Seine fishing was practiced during the winter. Votians formed seine groups (&quot;artelli&quot;) and made fishing trips as far as the Finnish outer islands like Seskar. Fishermen lived in wooden sleds called (&quot;pudka&quot;) during these trips. Hunting was never an important source of income, because local nobility had reserved the right to hunt to themselves. Since St. Petersburg was so close to Votic homelands, many of the Votes went working there. Men worked in factories and women worked as servants. This contributed to rapid demise of Votic culture.

Votes were quite poorly educated, and only one Vote, Dmitri Tsvetkov, is known to have ever attended and graduated from a university. Ancient Votic religion is not known well, but it is assumed that it was similar to other Finnic beliefs.

===Language and identity===
Most Votes were able to speak Ingrian and Russian as well as the Votic language. In fact, Ingrian was more common in everyday use than Votic in some villages. Votic was commonly used with family members, while Russian and Ingrian were used with others. Russian was the only language used in churches. Votes often referred to themselves as &quot;Izhorians&quot;, since this term was more commonly known among others. The term came in use when people wanted to make a difference between Lutheran and Orthodox Finnic populations in Ingria.

== Genetics ==
According to a 2024 study, the majority of Votians belong to the paternal haplogroup R1a. Their second most common haplogroup is N1c, which is typical for Finno-Ugric peoples. A small proportion of Votes have haplogroup I2a1. When comparing the paternal lineages (combination of ancient haplogroups) of Votians to other Baltic-Finnic groups living in Russia and Slavic Central Russians, they are closer to the latter. However, in terms of autosomal DNA, they resemble other Baltic Finns, especially Izhorians and Ingrian Finns, and differ from Central Russians.
