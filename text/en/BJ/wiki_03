<text>Varian Mackey Fry (October 15, 1907 – September 13, 1967) was an American journalist. Fry ran a rescue network in Vichy France from August 1940 to September 1941 that helped 2,000 anti-Nazi and Jewish refugees, mostly artists and intellectuals, escape from persecution by Nazi Germany during World War II.

Fry spent &quot;thirteen months directing a bold, high-risk, and much celebrated refugee-smuggling operation in the south of France that included an all-star cast of &quot;Kulturträgers&quot; [culture carriers], among them artists Marc Chagall and Max Ernst, and writer André Breton and philosopher Hannah Arendt.&quot; His activities, illegal under the laws of Vichy France, contrary to the policies of the United States government, and opposed by many of the other refugee relief organizations in France resulted in his expulsion and the severing of ties with him by his organization, the Emergency Rescue Committee.

He was the first of five Americans to be recognized as &quot;Righteous Among the Nations&quot;, an honorific given by the State of Israel to non-Jews who saved the lives of many Jews and anti-Nazi refugees during World War II.

==Early life==
Fry was born in New York City. His parents were Lillian (Mackey) and Arthur Fry, a manager of the Wall Street firm Carlysle and Mellick. The family moved to Ridgewood, New Jersey, in 1910. He grew up in Ridgewood and enjoyed bird-watching and reading. During World War I, at 9 years of age, Fry and friends conducted a fund-raising bazaar for the American Red Cross that included a vaudeville show, an ice cream stand and fish pond. He was educated at Hotchkiss School from 1922 to 1924, when he left the school due to hazing rituals. He then attended the Riverdale Country School, graduating in 1926.

An able and multilingual student, Fry scored in the top 10% of the Harvard University entrance exams. In 1927, as a Harvard undergraduate, he founded &quot;Hound &amp; Horn&quot;, an influential literary quarterly, in collaboration with Lincoln Kirstein. He was suspended for a prank just before graduation and had to repeat his senior year. Through Kirstein&#x27;s sister, Mina, he met his future wife, Eileen Avery Hughes, an editor of &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, who was seven years his senior and had been educated at Roedean School and Oxford University. Although Fry was a closeted homosexual, according to his son James, they married on 2 June 1931.

==Journalist==
While working as a foreign correspondent for the American journal &quot;The Living Age&quot;, Fry visited Berlin in 1935, and witnessed Nazi abuse against Jews on more than one occasion, which &quot;turned him into an ardent anti-Nazi&quot;. He said in 1945, &quot;I could not remain idle as long as I had any chances at all of saving even a few of its intended victims.&quot;

Following his visit to Berlin, in 1935 Fry wrote about the savage treatment of Jews by Hitler&#x27;s regime in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He wrote books about foreign affairs for Headline Books, owned by the Foreign Policy Association, including &quot;The Peace that Failed.&quot; It describes the troubled political climate following World War I, the break-up of Czechoslovakia and the events leading up to World War II.

==Emergency Rescue Committee==

In June 1940 during World War II, the army of Nazi Germany defeated France. The northern and western one-half of France was occupied by Germany; the southeastern one-half, called Vichy France, remained nominally independent, but with the obligation to &quot;surrender upon demand&quot; all German citizens if requested by the German government. Tens of thousands of refugees from Nazi Germany, and many others from elsewhere, had fled to Vichy France, mostly ending up in Marseilles or in one of the sordid refugee camps scattered around Vichy. The United States was still neutral in the war and maintained a diplomatic and commercial presence in Vichy France. Marseilles was a beehive of refugees and British soldiers stranded after the Dunkirk evacuation. Humanitarian and relief organizations in the city included the American Friends Service Committee (Quakers), Unitarians, YMCA, Red Cross, and seven Jewish organizations, especially HICEM whose funding came mostly from American Jews, were present to aid refugees. The Pat O&#x27;Leary Line in the city mostly helped stranded soldiers escape to Spain.

On June 25, 1940, two hundred prominent people met at the Hotel Commodore in New York City and founded the Emergency Rescue Committee (ERC). They raised 3,500 dollars in contributions and in mid-July began looking for a representative to serve in Marseilles. When none of the candidates seemed viable or willing, Fry volunteered and was accepted, albeit with reservations.

Fry was given three tasks for what was projected to be a three-week visit to France: (1) report on conditions impacting refugees; (2), help people identified as in danger from the Nazis escape to Portugal or Morocco; and (3) identify people who would work with the ERC. The emphasis would be on rescuing the elite intellectuals and artists trapped in Vichy France. Fry remained in France for thirteen months.

Fry was an unlikely choice as ERC&#x27;s representative. One of the founders of the ERC, Karl Frank, said, &quot;Send him to France, and he&#x27;s dead.&quot; That being said, Fry was probably not in great danger in France. At that time, &quot;an American passport gave most Americans abroad a reasonably justified sense of invulnerability.&quot; A biographer, Andy Marino, called Fry a &quot;neurasthenic intellectual and expert on the ancient Greeks.&quot; His advantages were that he was an American and thus from a neutral country, spoke some French and German, would be unknown to the German Gestapo, and might be seen by them as just-another &quot;high-minded dumb Yank.&quot; 
Eleanor Roosevelt supported the ERC; her husband Franklin, President of the United States, less so. He had an election to win in 1940 and refugees were not his priority. Moreover, the mood of the country was contrary to the admission of more refugees. A 1938 Roper Poll indicated that only 8.7 percent of the American populace wanted the United States to increase the number of refugees permitted to enter the U.S. beyond the number in the immigration quota. Another poll taken after the anti-Jewish Kristallnacht riots in Germany, found that only 21 percent of Americans wanted more Jewish immigrants to be admitted to the U.S. Department of State officials in charge of approving entry visas to refugees were often accused of being anti-Semitic and anti-refugee, but they reflected the views of the U.S. government and its people.

In 1942, the Emergency Rescue Committee and the American branch of the European-based International Relief Association joined forces under the name the International Relief and Rescue Committee, which was later shortened to the International Rescue Committee (IRC). The IRC has continued into the 21st century as a nonsectarian, nongovernmental international relief and development organization.

==France==

In August 1940, Fry arrived in Marseille representing the ERC in an effort to help persons seeking to flee the Nazis. Fry had $3,000 taped to his leg and a list of 200 artists and intellectuals, mostly German Jews, under imminent threat of arrest by agents of the Gestapo. He worked to circumvent bureaucratic processes set up by French authorities, who would not issue exit visas. Other anti-Nazi writers, avant-garde artists, musicians, and hundreds of others came to him, desperately seeking any chance to escape France. Fry&#x27;s organization in Marseilles was called the &quot;Centre Americain de Secours&quot; (American Center for Relief).

Initially, Fry relied on the experienced Waitstill Sharp of the Unitarian Service Committee to help him. Sharp said he spent three days orienting Fry on the techniques of semi-clandestine life. Fry&#x27;s first major operation in September 1940 was in cooperation with Sharp. Four of the refugees in Marseilles most likely to deported to Nazi Germany were novelists Lion Feuchtwanger and Heinrich Mann, Golo Mann, the son of novelist Thomas Mann, and Czech writer Franz Werfel, plus their family members and a few others. Determined to take the refugees to Spain and hence get them to the United States, Fry and Sharp accompanied the group to the Spanish border, and Sharp continued on with them to Lisbon. An American named Leon &quot;Dick&quot; Ball guided them via smugglers&#x27; foot trails across the Pyrenees to an illegal entry into Spain. Sharp was less than complimentary about Alma Werfel who crossed the border in a white flowing dress that could be seen for miles. Her &quot;legendary appeal&quot; was lost on him. All the party of refugees made it to the United States.

Back in Marseille, despite the watchful eye of the collaborationist Vichy regime, Fry and a small group of volunteers hid people at the Villa Air-Bel until they could be smuggled out through neutral Spain and then to the relative safety of neutral Portugal where they took ships, mostly to the United States. Some of the exiles escaped on ships leaving Marseille for the French Caribbean colony of Martinique, from where they might also go to the United States.

Fry&#x27;s most important associate was a young French Protestant named Daniel Bénédite who functioned as his Chef de Cabinet and often his eyes and ears. Bénédite was briefly imprisoned by the French for his activities with ERC, but released through the intervention of one of the American diplomats in Marseilles. American Charlie Fawcett was the security guard, responsible for policing the long line of refugees waiting to be interviewed at Fry&#x27;s headquarters. Fawcett also secured the release of several interned woman by claiming to be married to them. Among Fry&#x27;s closest associates were Americans Miriam Davenport, a former art student at the Sorbonne, and Chicago heiress Mary Jayne Gold, a lover of the arts and the &quot;good life&quot; who had come to Paris in the early 1930s. Gold was wealthy and financed many of the operations of the ERC.
Especially instrumental in getting Fry the U.S. visas he needed for the artists, intellectuals and political dissidents on his list was Hiram Bingham IV, an American Vice Consul in Marseilles. Bingham was personally responsible for issuing thousands of visas, many not in accordance with U.S. immigration policies. Another diplomat in Marseilles was Mexican Gilberto Bosques Saldívar who is credited with giving visas to 40,000 persons, mostly Jews, to emigrate to Mexico. The Unitarian office in Lisbon, under the direction of Charles Joy and, later, Robert Dexter, helped refugees to wait in safety for visas and other necessary papers, and to gain passage by sea from Lisbon. The YMCA representative in Marseilles, Donald A. Lowrie was the leader of an advocacy group for refugees of 25 aid organizations in Vichy France. Lowrie obtained false passports from Czech diplomat Vladamir Vochoc for Czech refugees, including many Jews, and passed them on to Fry. In the United States, helping to secure visas for refugees, was Alfred Barr, Director of the Museum of Modern Art, and his wife Margaret Scolari Barr, an art historian also working at the MoMA.

The &quot;Centre Americain de Secours&quot; office in Marseilles continued to function after Fry&#x27;s departure in September 1941, getting an additional 300 people out of France. The Vichy government ordered the office closed in June 1942.

==Controversy==
Fry was shunned by most of the refugee aid organizations in Vichy France, especially after a cable in September 1940 from U.S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull:

The priority of the United States in Vichy France was not facilitating the emigration of refugees to the U.S. John Hurley, a diplomat at the U.S. Consulate in Marseilles, advised Fry to return home and the ERC in New York called him back. He responded by justifying his program and saying that he needed to stay in Marseilles until a replacement arrived. He stayed another year. To Fry, the other refugee organizations were too law abiding, while they regarded him as a threat to their refugee aid programs and their attempts to build a working relationship with the American diplomats and Vichy officials to obtain visas and exit permits. HICEM, the well-funded and large Jewish organization, was wary of Fry as he was of them. He considered HICEM too sectarian. Apparently referring to Fry and the atmosphere at the Villa Air-Bel, Unitarian Charles Joy, said caustically that &quot;working with refugees was not a parlor game.&quot;

Fry was forced to leave France in September 1941 after officials of both the Vichy government and the State Department objected to his covert activities. He then spent more than a month in Lisbon before returning to the United States in October. In January 1942, the ERC fired him. &quot;Unfortunately, your attitude since returning to this country have made it inadvisable for us to continue your connection with the Committee,&quot; read the dismissal letter.

==Refugees aided by Fry==
Among the problems of Fry and his associates was the character of some of the refugees. Author Marino said the artistic and intellectual refugees handled by the ERC were like &quot;herding cats...these were arrogant Germans who were used to having servants and ordering people around. And they&#x27;d suddenly been thrust into a position where it was the opposite, and they were the supplicants, and they were the people who depended on others for their lives, not just employment and food.&quot;

Charlie Fawcett, one of Fry&#x27;s associates, commented similarly: &quot;They wouldn’t listen to you. They thought, &#x27;We were so famous, nobody will do anything to us.&#x27; Some of them said that! &#x27;The French wouldn’t dare to do anything to us—there’s world opinion.&#x27; World opinion—can you imagine that? Let me tell you, world opinion wasn’t standing behind them much in those days.&quot;

The selection of those deeded eligible for ERC help among many tens of thousands of refugees was a brutal process, consisting of interviews and the personal knowledge of Fry and his associates. Fry later admitted that mistakes were made in deciding who received and who was denied help. The ERC staff was leery of anyone not known to them as he or she could be a police spy.

==Back in the United States==

Fry wrote and spoke critically against U.S. immigration policies particularly relating to the fate of Jews in Europe. In a December 1942 issue of &quot;The New Republic&quot;, he wrote a scathing article titled: &quot;The Massacre of Jews in Europe&quot;.

Other American refugee workers with experience in Europe, acknowledging that Fry&#x27;s program in France had been effective, recruited him in 1944 to provide guidance to the Roosevelt administration&#x27;s late-breaking refugee rescue program, the War Refugee Board.

Fry published a book in 1945 about his time in France under the title &quot;Surrender on Demand&quot;, first published by Random House, 1945. (Its title refers to the 1940 French-German armistice clause requiring France to hand over to German authorities any refugee from &quot;Greater Germany&quot; the Gestapo might identify, a requirement Fry routinely violated.) A later edition was published by Johnson Books, in 1997, in conjunction with the U.S. Holocaust Museum. In 1968, the US publisher Scholastic (which markets mainly to children and adolescents) published a paperback edition under the title &quot;Assignment: Rescue&quot;.

After the war, Fry worked as a journalist, magazine editor and business writer. He also taught college and was in film production. Feeling as if he had lived the peak of his life in France, he developed ulcers. Fry went into psychoanalysis and said that &quot;as time went on, he grew more and more troubled.&quot;

Fry and his wife Eileen divorced after he returned from France. She developed cancer and died on May 12, 1948. During her hospital convalescence, Fry visited her and read to her daily. At the end of 1948 or early 1949, Fry met Annette Riley, who was 16 years his junior. They married in 1950, had three children together, but were separated in 1966, possibly owing to his irrational behavior, believed to have been a result of manic depression.

Fry died of a cerebral hemorrhage and was found dead in his bed on September 13, 1967, by the Connecticut State Police. He was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn, New York with his parents.

Fry&#x27;s papers are held in Columbia University&#x27;s Rare Book and Manuscript Library.

<text>The Socialist Party of Latvia (, abbr. LSP; ) is a communist party in Latvia. It is positioned on the far-left on the political spectrum.

It was formed in 1994 as a successor party to the Communist Party of Latvia, which was banned in 1991. According to the &quot;programme of the party&quot;, the LSP was founded as an organization upholding socialist ideas after the 1991 events that the party describes as a &quot;counter-revolutionary bourgeois-nationalist coup&quot;.

== Overview ==
The current CEOs of the party are Bokišs Fridijs, Burlaks Ingars and Frolovs Vladimirs. Between 1999 and 2015, the position was held by Alfrēds Rubiks, once mayor of Riga and later, leader of the unionist movement and head of the Latvian Communist Party (CPSU platform). He was imprisoned for six years in 1991, on charges of participating in a coup d&#x27;état against the Latvian authorities in August 1991. He is not one of the party&#x27;s members in the Saeima (Latvian Parliament) since he is not allowed to contest elections. However, his sons Artūrs Rubiks and Raimonds Rubiks are members of the Saeima representing the Socialist Party, elected on a joint list with Harmony.

The LSP is more popular among the Russian-speaking population of Latvia. It places a high priority on issues important to ethnic Russians, such as language and citizenship laws. The party also believes that Latvian citizenship should be granted to all citizens of the former USSR living in Latvia in 1990. This would entail a major change in the current law, which only gives automatic citizenship to descendants of people who were citizens of the Republic of Latvia before it was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940, and requires the Soviet citizens who moved to Latvia between 1940 and 1990 (mainly Russians), to go through a naturalization process.

In the election held on 5 October 2002, the party was part of the For Human Rights in United Latvia () coalition that won 19.0% of the popular vote and 25 out of 100 seats, 5 of those seats went to Socialist Party. The party was a member of this alliance of predominantly Russian-speaking parties from 1998 to 2003.

Today, the party&#x27;s platform is centered on anti-corruption and promoting an independent Latvia that is outside the European Union. In 2005, the LSP entered the Harmony Centre coalition, which won 17 seats in the 2006 election. Four of these 17 parliament members were representatives of the Socialist Party. In 2011, HC won 31 seats, with the Socialists receiving three seats (Artūrs Rubiks, Raimonds Rubiks and Igors Zujevs). The party did not contest the 2014 parliamentary election, however, all three of its outgoing MPs were placed on the SDPS list and were members of the &quot;12th Saeima&quot; (2014–2018). The same strategy was used in the 2018 election, but only Artūrs Rubiks was elected. The party gained a seat within the Harmony list for the 2020 Riga City Council election, with Artūrs Rubiks&#x27; older brother Raimonds Rubiks being elected.

<doc id="356655" wikidata="Q1034435" url="?curid=356655" title="Cape Henlopen State Park">
<text>Cape Henlopen State Park is a Delaware state park on on Cape Henlopen in Sussex County, Delaware, in the United States. William Penn made the beaches of Cape Henlopen one of the first public lands established in what has become the United States in 1682 with the declaration that Cape Henlopen would be for &quot;the usage of the citizens of Lewes and Sussex County.&quot; Cape Henlopen State Park has a 24-hour and year-round fishing pier as well as campgrounds. The remainder of the park is only open from sunrise to sunset, and includes a bathhouse on the Atlantic Ocean, an area for surf-fishing, a disc golf course, and bicycle and walking paths. The beach at Herring Point is a popular surfing spot. The park is a stop on Delaware&#x27;s Coastal Heritage Greenway.

==History==
Cape Henlopen, on Delaware Bay, has long been a public use area although it did not officially become a Delaware state park until 1964. William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania and early leader of Delaware, decreed that Cape Henlopen and its natural resources be set aside for the use and enjoyment of the citizens of the Delaware Colony. Penn&#x27;s decree established Cape Henlopen as one of the first public use parcels of land in the Thirteen Colonies.

The cape was an important strategic location for the U.S. Navy and Army during the American Revolution, War of 1812, Civil War, World War I, and World War II. Cape Henlopen Light, the sixth lighthouse built on the Atlantic Coast, was constructed from 1767-1769. This lighthouse was in operation until 1924 when it was abandoned after it was extensively damaged in 1920 by a storm. The lighthouse now rests at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, after falling into the water on April 13, 1926.

A small gun platform was built by 1918 near the present site of Point Comfort parking lot. It was abandoned and removed prior to construction of Fort Miles.

During World War II, the U.S. Army built Fort Miles at Cape Henlopen. Numerous bunkers, concrete observation towers and the pier built to accommodate the laying of mines on the harbor floor remain today. Within the park grounds are a handful of fire control towers from that era, as well as underground gun batteries (bunkers) which were to be used in conjunction with the towers against the eventuality of air attack.
Off the coast on the bay side are two lighthouses: the Harbor of Refuge Light and the Delaware Breakwater East End Light.

==Wildlife==
Cape Henlopen State Park is home to a vast array of wildlife, notably several species of shorebird. The black skimmer, least tern, and piping plover are all endangered species that are abundant within the park. Horseshoe crabs are also very common, especially in the Delaware Bay.

==Activities and amenities==
The beach at Cape Henlopen State Park is open year-round. There are two beaches that are open to swimming at the park with lifeguard patrols between the Memorial and Labor Day weekends. A modern bath house with showers, changing rooms and a snack bar is located at the northern beach. North Shore Beach, the southern beach at Cape Henlopen State Park, is a popular beach among lesbians.

Cape Henlopen State Park has two facilities that are rented out for large group gatherings, a pavilion for picnics and the &quot;Officer&#x27;s Club&quot; a remnant of the Fort Miles days. The 18 hole disc golf course and basketball courts are open year-round. Hunting is permitted during Delaware&#x27;s designated hunting seasons in some parts of the park.

Cape Henlopen State Park is a popular fishing destination. Anglers may fish from the beach or from the fishing pier on Delaware Bay. A concessionaire operates the Cape Henlopen Fishing Center, a bait and tackle shop at the pier. It is open seven days a week May 15 - October 1. Visitors to the park may drive onto the beach for surf fishing after receiving a permit from the park authorities. Access over the dunes is open to pedestrians at all times.

The pine covered dunes of Cape Henlopen State Park are open to camping in some areas with over 150 campsite available. Most sites have running water. They are available from family camping March 1 - November 30. Reservations are required. A primitive campground is available for use by youth groups.

There are a variety of marked nature and hiking trails at the park, ranging from a beach to pine forests. Bicycles are another popular way to explore the park, and free bike loans are available (weather permitting).

Cape Henlopen State Park is the eastern terminus of the American Discovery Trail, which is the only transcontinental trail in the United States.
The park&#x27;s Seaside Nature Center features marine aquariums and natural history exhibits about the park. Environmental education programs are offered year-round. The nature center also contains an auditorium and a gift shop. Programs offered include hayrides, guided nature walks and hikes, birding trips, preschool programs, school programs and children&#x27;s vacation workshops.

<doc id="356670" wikidata="Q2565443" url="?curid=356670" title="We the Living">
<text>We the Living is the debut novel of the Russian American novelist Ayn Rand. It is a story of life in post-revolutionary Russia and was Rand&#x27;s first statement against communism. Rand observes in the foreword that &quot;We the Living&quot; was the closest she would ever come to writing an autobiography. Rand finished writing the novel in 1934, but it was rejected by several publishers before being released by Macmillan Publishing in 1936. It has since sold more than three million copies.

==Plot==
The story takes place from 1922 to 1925, in post-revolutionary Russia. Kira Argounova, the protagonist of the story, is the younger daughter of a bourgeois family. An independent spirit with a will to match, she rejects any attempt by her family or the nascent Soviet state to cast her into a mold. At the beginning of the story, Kira returns to Petrograd with her family, after a prolonged exile due to the assault of the Bolshevik revolutionaries. Kira&#x27;s father had been the owner of a textile factory, which was seized and nationalized. Having given up all hopes of regaining their past possessions after the victories of the Red Army, the family returns to the city in search of livelihood. They find that their home has also been seized and converted to living quarters for several families.

Kira&#x27;s family eventually manages to find living quarters, and Kira&#x27;s father gets a license to open a textile shop, an establishment that is but a shadow of his old firm. Life is excruciatingly difficult in these times; living standards are poor, and weary citizens wait in long queues for meager rations of food and fuel. With some effort, Kira manages to obtain her Labor Book, which permits her to study and work. Kira also manages to enroll in the Technological Institute, where she aspires to fulfill her dream of becoming an engineer. At the Institute, Kira meets fellow student Andrei Taganov, an idealistic Communist and an officer in the GPU (the Soviet secret police). The two share a mutual respect and admiration for each other in spite of their differing political beliefs, and become friends.

In a chance encounter, Kira meets Leo Kovalensky, an attractive man with a free spirit. It is love at first sight for Kira, and she throws herself at Leo, who initially takes her to be a prostitute. He is also strongly attracted to her and promises to meet her again. Kira and Leo are shown to be united by their desperate lives and their beliefs that run counter to what is being thrust on them by the state. After a couple of meetings, when they share their deep contempt for the state of their lives, the two plan to escape the country together.

Kira and Leo are caught while attempting to flee the country, but escape imprisonment with the help of a GPU officer who knew Leo&#x27;s father before the revolution. Kira leaves her parents&#x27; apartment and moves into Leo&#x27;s. She is expelled from the Technological Institute as the result of a purge of all students connected to the bourgeoisie, and she loses her job as well. The relationship between Kira and Leo, intense and passionate in the beginning, begins to deteriorate under the weight of their hardships and their different reactions. Kira keeps her ideas and aspirations alive, but decides to go along with the system until she feels powerful enough to challenge it. Leo, in contrast, sinks slowly into indifference and depression. He contracts tuberculosis and is prescribed treatment in a sanatorium. Kira&#x27;s efforts to finance his treatment fail, and her appeals to the authorities to get state help fall on deaf ears.

As Kira&#x27;s relationship with Leo evolves, so does her relationship with Andrei. Despite their political differences, she finds Andrei to be the one person with whom she can discuss her most intimate thoughts and views. Andrei&#x27;s affection and respect for Kira slowly turns into love. When he confesses his love to Kira, she is dismayed but also desperate, so she feigns love for Andrei and agrees to become his mistress. She uses money from Andrei to fund Leo&#x27;s treatment.

Leo returns cured of tuberculosis and healthy, but a changed man. He opens a food store that is a front for black market trade, bribing a GPU officer to look the other way. Andrei, who is concerned that corruption is damaging the communist state, starts investigating the store. He arrests Leo and in the process discovers that Kira has secretly been living with Leo. Disillusioned about both his personal relationship and his political ideals, Andrei secures Leo&#x27;s release and shortly thereafter commits suicide. Kira, perhaps the only genuine mourner at his state funeral, wonders if she has killed him. Having lost any moral sense that he may have left, Leo leaves Kira to begin a new life as a gigolo. After Leo&#x27;s departure, Kira makes a final attempt to cross the border. Almost in sight of freedom, she is shot by a border guard and dies.

==Publication history==

===Background===
Ayn Rand was born in 1905 in Saint Petersburg, then capital of the Russian Empire, to a bourgeois family whose property was expropriated by the Bolshevik government after the 1917 Russian Revolution. Concerned about her safety due to her strong anti-communist views, Rand&#x27;s family helped her emigrate to the United States in 1926. She moved to Hollywood, where she obtained a job as a junior screenwriter and also worked on other writing projects. In 1929 she began a novel under the working title &quot;Airtight: A Novel of Red Russia&quot;; it drew on her experiences to depict life in the Soviet Union in the 1920s and criticize the Soviet government and communist ideology.

===Initial publication===

The novel was first completed in 1934. Despite support from H. L. Mencken, who deemed it &quot;a really excellent piece of work&quot;, it was rejected by several publishers until September 1935, when George Platt Brett of Macmillan Publishing agreed to publish it. Brett&#x27;s decision was not without controversy within Macmillan. Associate editor Granville Hicks, then a member of the Communist Party USA, was strongly opposed to publishing Rand&#x27;s novel. Rand later said that Brett was unsure whether the novel would turn a profit, but he thought it was a book that ought to be published. The first edition was issued on April 7, 1936.

The initial American publication of &quot;We the Living&quot; was not a commercial success. Macmillan did not expect the novel to sell and did little marketing. Initial sales were slow and although they picked up later, Macmillan destroyed the plates before the first printing of 3000 copies sold out. Eighteen months after its release, the novel was out of print. Rand&#x27;s royalties from the first American edition amounted to $100.

There was also a British publication by Cassell in January 1937, and editions were published in Denmark and Italy. These did considerably better than the American release, remaining in print into the 1940s.

===Revised edition===
In 1957, Rand&#x27;s novel &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; became a best-seller for Random House. Its success motivated them to republish &quot;We the Living&quot; in 1959. In preparation for the new edition, Rand made some changes to the text. In her foreword to the revised edition, Rand declared that &quot;In brief, all the changes are merely editorial line changes.&quot; Rand&#x27;s description notwithstanding, some of the changes have been taken to have philosophical significance. In the first edition, Kira said to Andrei, &quot;I loathe your ideals. I admire your methods.&quot; In the second edition, this became simply &quot;I loathe your ideals.&quot; A few pages later, Kira said to Andrei, &quot;What are your masses but mud to be ground underfoot, fuel to be burned for those who deserve it?&quot; Rand&#x27;s revision deleted this sentence.

The significance of these and other revisions has been debated. Rand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein commented, &quot;She claims that the revision was minimal. Some readers of both editions have questioned her definition of &#x27;minimal&#x27;.&quot; According to Ronald Merrill, Kira in the first edition &quot;adopts in the most explicit terms possible the ethical position of Friedrich Nietzsche&quot;. Rand had made her break with Nietzsche by the time she published &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;. Canadian writer Barbara Branden said that &quot;Some of her readers were disturbed when they discovered this and similar changes&quot;, but insisted that &quot;unlike Nietzsche, she rejected as unforgivably immoral any suggestion that the superior man had the right to use physical force as a means to his end.&quot; Robert Mayhew cautioned that &quot;We should not conclude too quickly that these passages are strong evidence of an earlier Nietzschean phase in Ayn Rand&#x27;s development, because such language can be strictly metaphorical (even if the result of an early interest in Nietzsche)&quot;. Susan Love Brown countered that &quot;Mayhew becomes an apologist for Rand&#x27;s denials of change and smooths over the fact that Rand herself saw the error of her ways and corrected them.&quot;

Nearly everyone who reads &quot;We the Living&quot; today reads the second edition. The first is a rare book; the second has sold over three million copies.

===Deleted passages===
Some passages were deleted during publication, which were posthumously published in section 2 of &quot;The Early Ayn Rand&quot; in 1984 for the first time.

==Reception and influence==
Rand believed that &quot;We the Living&quot; was not widely reviewed; however, Rand scholar Michael S. Berliner says &quot;it was the most reviewed of any of her works&quot;, with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications. Overall these reviews were mixed, but more positive than the reviews she received for her later work. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, reviewer Harold Strauss said Rand had &quot;a good deal of narrative skill&quot;, but the novel was &quot;slavishly warped to the dictates of propaganda&quot; against the Soviets. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; called it a &quot;first rate&quot; representation of the realities of life in Soviet Russia. In his syndicated &quot;A Book a Day&quot; column, Bruce Catton called it &quot;a tragic story&quot; about the harmful impact of revolution on the middle class. Ethel Lockwood recommended it as a realistic look at the impact of Soviet policies, but warned it was not for the &quot;squeamish&quot; or those unaccustomed to &quot;the continental viewpoint toward sex relationships&quot;.

When the book was released in Australia, it received several positive reviews. In the &quot;Australian Women&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, news editor Leslie Haylen described the novel as &quot;very vivid, human, and wholly satisfying&quot;, saying it described Russian life without taking sides. &quot;The Barrier Miner&quot; said it was &quot;entertaining&quot; and &quot;intensely moving&quot;, and not at all propaganda. The &quot;Wodonga and Towong Sentinel&quot; called it a &quot;vivid story&quot; that showed Russia &quot;dispassionately, without once imposing any preconceived ideas on the reader&quot;.

Rand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein compared it to two of her later novels, saying, &quot;While it does not have the power of &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; or the majestic sweep of &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot;, &quot;We the Living&quot; is still a compelling story about interesting characters.&quot; Literary professor Shoshana Milgram connected the novel&#x27;s themes to those of Rand&#x27;s 1938 novella &quot;Anthem&quot;: both address individualism and the word &quot;I&quot;, and &quot;Anthem&quot; heroine Liberty 5-3000 is reminiscent of Kira, both being &quot;strong and defiant&quot; women who are submissive with their respective male protagonists. Historian James Baker said it was &quot;preachy&quot; and &quot;indoctrinated without entertaining&quot;.

==Adaptations==
===Play===

Shortly after the novel was published, Rand began negotiations with Broadway producer Jerome Mayer to do a theatrical adaptation. Rand wrote the script, but Mayer&#x27;s financing fell through. Several years later, she was able to interest George Abbott in producing the play. Helen Craig took the lead role as Kira, alongside John Emery as Leo and Dean Jagger as Andrei. It opened under the title &quot;The Unconquered&quot; at the Biltmore Theatre on February 13, 1940, but closed just five days later after scathing reviews.

The play was not published during Rand&#x27;s lifetime. In 2014, Palgrave Macmillan published a volume with both the final script and an earlier version, edited by Robert Mayhew.

===Film===
&quot;We the Living&quot; was published in an Italian translation in 1937. Without Rand&#x27;s permission, it was adapted in 1942 as an Italian film, released in two parts, titled &quot;Noi Vivi&quot; (&quot;We the Living&quot;) and &quot;Addio Kira&quot; (&quot;Goodbye Kira&quot;). The films were directed by Goffredo Alessandrini for Scalera Films of Rome, and starred Alida Valli as Kira, Fosco Giachetti as Andrei, and Rossano Brazzi as Leo. Prior to their release, the films were nearly censored by Mussolini&#x27;s government, but they were permitted because the story itself was set in Soviet Russia and was directly critical of that regime. The films were successful, and the public easily realized that they were as much against fascism as communism. After several weeks, German authorities, who were allied with the Italian government, insisted that the film be pulled from distribution because of its anti-Fascist themes.

Rediscovered in the 1960s through the efforts of Rand&#x27;s lawyers, Erika Holzer and Henry Mark Holzer, these films were re-edited into a new version with English subtitles composed by Erika Holzer and revision co-producer Duncan Scott. This version, approved by Rand and her estate, was re-released as &quot;We the Living&quot; in 1986.

<text>The pipa, pípá, or p&#x27;i-p&#x27;a () is a traditional Chinese musical instrument belonging to the plucked category of instruments. Sometimes called the &quot;Chinese lute&quot;, the instrument has a pear-shaped wooden body with a varying number of frets ranging from 12 to 31. Another Chinese four-string plucked lute is the liuqin, which looks like a smaller version of the pipa. The pear-shaped instrument may have existed in China as early as the Han dynasty, and although historically the term &quot;pipa&quot; was once used to refer to a variety of plucked chordophones, its usage since the Song dynasty refers exclusively to the pear-shaped instrument.

The pipa is one of the most popular Chinese instruments and has been played for almost two thousand years in China. Several related instruments are derived from the pipa, including the Japanese biwa and Korean bipa in East Asia, and the Vietnamese đàn tỳ bà in Southeast Asia. The Korean instrument is the only one of the three that is no longer widely used.

==History==
There are some confusions and disagreements about the origin of pipa. This may be due to the fact that the word pipa was used in ancient texts to describe a variety of plucked chordophones of the period from the Qin to the Tang dynasty, including the long-necked spiked lute and the short-necked lute, as well as the differing accounts given in these ancient texts. Traditional Chinese narrative prefers the story of the Han Chinese Princess Liu Xijun sent to marry a barbarian Wusun king during the Han dynasty, with the &quot;pipa&quot; being invented so she could play music on horseback to soothe her longings. Modern researchers such as Laurence Picken, Shigeo Kishibe, and John Myers suggested a non-Chinese origin.

The earliest mention of pipa in Chinese texts appeared late in the Han dynasty around the 2nd century AD. According to Liu Xi&#x27;s Eastern Han dynasty &quot;Dictionary of Names&quot;, the word pipa may have an onomatopoeic origin (the word being similar to the sounds the instrument makes), although modern scholarship suggests a possible derivation from the Persian word &quot;barbat&quot;, the two theories however are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Liu Xi also stated that the instrument called &quot;pipa&quot;, though written differently ( or ) in the earliest texts, originated from amongst the Hu people (a general term for non-Han people living to the north and west of ancient China). 

Another Han dynasty text, &quot;Fengsu Tongyi&quot;, also indicates that, at that time, &quot;pipa&quot; was a recent arrival, although later 3rd-century texts from the Jin dynasty suggest that pipa existed in China as early as the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC). An instrument called &quot;xiantao&quot; (弦鼗), made by stretching strings over a small drum with handle, was said to have been played by labourers who constructed the Great Wall of China during the late Qin dynasty. This may have given rise to the &quot;Qin pipa&quot;, an instrument with a straight neck and a round sound box, and evolved into &quot;ruan&quot;, an instrument named after Ruan Xian, one of the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove and known for playing similar instrument. Yet another term used in ancient text was &quot;Qinhanzi&quot; (秦漢子), perhaps similar to Qin pipa with a straight neck and a round body, but modern opinions differ on its precise form.
The pear-shaped pipa is likely to have been introduced to China from Central Asia, Gandhara, and/or India. As people traveled along the Silk Road, the &quot;oval&quot; or oval-shaped pipa traveled through Central Asia and was introduced to China, where it became known as the &quot;pipa.&quot; 

Pear-shaped lutes have been depicted in Kusana sculptures from the 1st century AD. The pear-shaped pipa may have been introduced during the Han dynasty and was referred to as Han pipa. However, depictions of the pear-shaped pipas in China only appeared after the Han dynasty during the Jin dynasty in the late 4th to early 5th century. Pipa acquired a number of Chinese symbolisms during the Han dynasty - the instrument length of three feet five inches represents the three realms (heaven, earth, and man) and the five elements, while the four strings represent the four seasons.

Depictions of the pear-shaped pipas appeared in abundance from the Southern and Northern dynasties onwards, and pipas from this time to the Tang dynasty were given various names, such as Hu pipa (胡琵琶), bent-neck pipa (曲項琵琶, quxiang pipa), some of these terms however may refer to the same pipa. Apart from the four-stringed pipa, other pear-shaped instruments introduced include the five-stringed, straight-necked, wuxian pipa (五弦琵琶, also known as Kuchean pipa (龜茲琵琶)), a six-stringed version, as well as the two-stringed hulei (忽雷). From the 3rd century onwards, through the Sui and Tang dynasty, the pear-shaped &quot;pipas&quot; became increasingly popular in China. By the Song dynasty, the word pipa was used to refer exclusively to the four-stringed pear-shaped instrument.
The pipa reached a height of popularity during the Tang dynasty, and was a principal musical instrument in the imperial court. It may be played as a solo instrument or as part of the imperial orchestra for use in productions such as &quot;daqu&quot; (大曲, grand suites), an elaborate music and dance performance. During this time, Persian and Kuchan performers and teachers were in demand in the capital, Chang&#x27;an (which had a large Persian community). Some delicately carved &quot;pipa&quot;s with beautiful inlaid patterns date from this period, with particularly fine examples preserved in the Shosoin Museum in Japan. It had close association with Buddhism and often appeared in mural and sculptural representations of musicians in Buddhist contexts. One of the Buddhist Four Heavenly Kings, the Eastern Dhṛtarāṣṭra, is often depicted with a pipa. Additionally, masses of &quot;pipa&quot;-playing Buddhist semi-deities are depicted in the wall paintings of the Mogao Caves near Dunhuang. The four and five-stringed &quot;pipas&quot; were especially popular during the Tang dynasty, and these instruments were introduced into Japan during the Tang dynasty as well as into other regions such as Korea and Vietnam. The five-stringed &quot;pipa&quot; however had fallen from use by the Song dynasty, although attempts have been made to revive this instrument in the early 21st century with a modernized five-string pipa modeled on the Tang dynasty instrument.

During the Song dynasty, &quot;pipa&quot; fell from favour at the imperial court, perhaps a result of the influence of neo-Confucian nativism as &quot;pipa&quot; had foreign associations. However, it continued to be played as a folk instrument that also gained the interest of the literati. The &quot;pipa&quot; underwent a number of changes over the centuries. 

By the Ming dynasty, fingers replaced plectrum as the popular technique for playing pipa, although finger-playing techniques existed as early as Tang. Extra frets were added; the early instrument had 4 frets (相, &quot;xiāng&quot;) on the neck, but during the early Ming dynasty extra bamboo frets (品, pǐn) were affixed onto the soundboard, increasing the number of frets to around 10 and therefore the range of the instrument. The short neck of the Tang &quot;pipa&quot; also became more elongated.

In the subsequent periods, the number of frets gradually increased, from around 10 to 14 or 16 during the Qing dynasty, then to 19, 24, 29, and 30 in the 20th century. The 4 wedge-shaped frets on the neck became 6 during the 20th century. 

The 14- or 16-fret &quot;pipa&quot; had frets arranged in approximately equivalent to the western tone and semitone, starting at the nut, the intervals were &quot;T-S-S-S-T-S-S-S-T-T-3/4-3/4-T-T-3/4-3/4&quot;. Some frets produced a &quot;3/4&quot; tone or &quot;neutral tone&quot;. In the 1920s and 1930s, the number of frets was increased to 24, based on the 12 tone equal temperament scale, with all the intervals being semitones. The traditional 16-fret &quot;pipa&quot; became less common, although it is still used in some regional styles such as the pipa in the southern genre of &quot;nanguan&quot;/nanyin. The horizontal playing position became the vertical (or near-vertical) position by the Qing dynasty, although in some regional genres such as nanguan the pipa is still held guitar fashion. 

During the 1950s, the use of metal strings in place of the traditional silk ones also resulted in a change in the sound of the pipa which became brighter and stronger.

===In Chinese literature===
Early literary tradition in China, for example in a 3rd-century description by Fu Xuan, &quot;Ode to Pipa&quot;, associates the Han pipa with the northern frontier, Wang Zhaojun and other princesses who were married to nomad rulers of the Wusun and Xiongnu peoples in what is now Mongolia, northern Xinjiang and Kazakhstan. Wang Zhaojun in particular is frequently referenced with pipa in later literary works and lyrics, for example Ma Zhiyuan&#x27;s play &quot;Autumn in the Palace of Han&quot; (漢宮秋), especially since the Song dynasty (although her story is often conflated with other women including Liu Xijun), as well as in music pieces such as &quot;Zhaojun&#x27;s Lament&quot; (昭君怨, also the title of a poem), and in paintings where she is often depicted holding a pipa.

There are many references to pipa in Tang literary works, for example, in &quot;A Music Conservatory Miscellany&quot; Duan Anjie related many anecdotes associated with pipa. The &quot;pipa&quot; is mentioned frequently in the Tang dynasty poetry, where it is often praised for its expressiveness, refinement and delicacy of tone, with poems dedicated to well-known players describing their performances. A famous poem by Bai Juyi, &quot;Pipa xing&quot; (琵琶行), contains a description of a pipa performance during a chance encounter with a female pipa player on the Yangtze River:

The encounter also inspired a poem by Yuan Zhen, &quot;Song of Pipa&quot; (琵琶歌). Another excerpt of figurative descriptions of a pipa music may be found in a eulogy for a pipa player, &quot;Lament for Shancai&quot; by Li Shen:

During the Song dynasty, many of the literati and poets wrote &quot;ci&quot; verses, a form of poetry meant to be sung and accompanied by instruments such as &quot;pipa&quot;. They included Ouyang Xiu, Wang Anshi, and Su Shi. During the Yuan dynasty, the playwright Gao Ming wrote a play for &quot;nanxi&quot; opera called &quot;Pipa ji&quot; (琵琶記, or &quot;Story of the Pipa&quot;), a tale about an abandoned wife who set out to find her husband, surviving by playing the &quot;pipa&quot;. It is one of the most enduring works in Chinese theatre, and one that became a model for Ming dynasty drama as it was the favorite opera of the first Ming emperor. The Ming collection of supernatural tales &quot;Fengshen Yanyi&quot; tells the story of Pipa Jing, a pipa spirit, but ghost stories involving &quot;pipa&quot; existed as early as the Jin dynasty, for example in the 4th century collection of tales &quot;Soushen Ji&quot;. Novels of the Ming and Qing dynasties such as &quot;Jin Ping Mei&quot; showed &quot;pipa&quot; performance to be a normal aspect of life in these periods at home (where the characters in the novels may be proficient in the instrument) as well as outside on the street or in pleasure houses.

==Playing and performance==

The name &quot;pipa&quot; is made up of two Chinese syllables, &quot;pí&quot; (琵) and &quot;pá&quot; (琶). These, according to the Han dynasty text by Liu Xi, refer to the way the instrument is played – &quot;pí&quot; is to strike outward with the right hand, and &quot;pá&quot; is to pluck inward towards the palm of the hand. The strings were played using a large plectrum in the Tang dynasty, a technique still used now for the Japanese biwa. It has however been suggested that the long plectrum depicted in ancient paintings may have been used as a friction stick like a bow. The plectrum has now been largely replaced by the fingernails of the right hand. The most basic technique, &quot;tantiao&quot; (彈挑), involves just the index finger and thumb (&quot;tan&quot; is striking with the index finger, &quot;tiao&quot; with the thumb). The fingers normally strike the strings of pipa in the opposite direction to the way a guitar is usually played, i.e. the fingers and thumb flick outward, unlike the guitar where the fingers and thumb normally pluck inward towards the palm of the hand. Plucking in the opposite direction to &quot;tan&quot; and &quot;tiao&quot; are called &quot;mo&quot; (抹) and &quot;gou&quot; (勾) respectively. When two strings are plucked at the same time with the index finger and thumb (i.e. the finger and thumb separate in one action), it is called &quot;fen&quot; (分), the reverse motion is called &quot;zhi&quot; (摭). A rapid strum is called &quot;sao&quot; (掃), and strumming in the reverse direction is called &quot;fu&quot; (拂). A distinctive sound of pipa is the tremolo produced by the &quot;lunzhi&quot; (輪指) technique which involves all the fingers and thumb of the right hand. It is however possible to produce the tremolo with just one or more fingers.The left hand techniques are important for the expressiveness of pipa music. Techniques that produce vibrato, portamento, glissando, pizzicato, harmonics or artificial harmonics found in violin or guitar are also found in pipa. String-bending for example may be used to produce a glissando or portamento. Note however that the frets on all Chinese lutes are high so that the fingers and strings never touch the fingerboard in between the frets, this is different from many Western fretted instruments and allows for dramatic vibrato and other pitch changing effects.

In addition, there are a number of techniques that produce sound effects rather than musical notes, for example, striking the board of the pipa for a percussive sound, or strings-twisting while playing that produces a cymbal-like effect.

The strings are usually tuned to although there are various other ways of tuning. Since the revolutions in Chinese instrument-making during the 20th century, the softer twisted silk strings of earlier times have been exchanged for nylon-wound steel strings, which are far too strong for human fingernails, so false nails are now used, constructed of plastic or tortoise-shell, and affixed to the fingertips with the player&#x27;s choice of elastic tape. However, false nails made of horn existed as early as the Ming period when finger-picking became the popular technique for playing pipa.

The pipa is held in a vertical or near-vertical position during performance, although in the early periods the instrument was held in the horizontal position or near-horizontal with the neck pointing slightly downwards, or upside down. Starting about the 10th century, players began to hold the instrument &quot;more upright&quot;, as the fingernail style became more important. Through time, the neck was raised and by the Qing dynasty the instrument was mostly played upright.
==Repertoire==

Pipa has been played solo, or as part of a large ensemble or small group since the early times. Few pieces for pipa survived from the early periods, some, however, are preserved in Japan as part of togaku (Tang music) tradition. In the early 20th century, twenty-five pieces were found amongst 10th-century manuscripts in the Mogao caves near Dunhuang, most of these pieces however may have originated from the Tang dynasty. The scores were written in tablature form with no information on tuning given, there are therefore uncertainties in the reconstruction of the music as well as deciphering other symbols in the score. Three Ming dynasty pieces were discovered in the &quot;High River Flows East&quot; (高河江東, &quot;Gaohe Jiangdong&quot;) collection dating from 1528 which are very similar to those performed today, such as &quot;The Moon on High&quot; (月兒高, &quot;Yue-er Gao&quot;). During the Qing dynasty, scores for pipa were collected in &quot;Thirteen Pieces for Strings&quot;. During the Qing dynasty there originally two major schools of &quot;pipa&quot;—the Northern and Southern schools, and music scores for these two traditions were collected and published in the first mass-produced edition of solo pieces for pipa, now commonly known as the &quot;Hua Collection&quot; (華氏譜). The collection was edited by Hua Qiuping (華秋萍, 1784–1859) and published in 1819 in three volumes. The first volume contains 13 pieces from the Northern school, the second and third volumes contain 54 pieces from the Southern school. Famous pieces such as &quot;Ambushed from Ten Sides&quot;, &quot;The Warlord Takes Off His Armour&quot;, and &quot;Flute and Drum at Sunset&quot; were first described in this collection. The earliest-known piece in the collection may be &quot;Eagle Seizing a Crane&quot; (海青挐鶴) which was mentioned in a Yuan dynasty text. Other collections from the Qing dynasty were compiled by Li Fangyuan (李芳園) and Ju Shilin (鞠士林), each representing different schools, and many of the pieces currently popular were described in these Qing collections. Further important collections were published in the 20th century.

The pipa pieces in the common repertoire can be categorized as &quot;wen&quot; (文, civil) or &quot;wu&quot; (武, martial), and &quot;da&quot; (大, large or suite) or &quot;xiao&quot; (小, small). The &quot;wen&quot; style is more lyrical and slower in tempo, with softer dynamic and subtler colour, and such pieces typically describe love, sorrow, and scenes of nature. Pieces in the &quot;Wu&quot; style are generally more rhythmic and faster, and often depict scenes of battles and are played in a vigorous fashion employing a variety of techniques and sound effects. The &quot;wu&quot; style was associated more with the Northern school while the &quot;wen&quot; style was more the Southern school. The &quot;da&quot; and &quot;xiao&quot; categories refer to the size of the piece – &quot;xiao&quot; pieces are small pieces normally containing only one section, while &quot;da&quot; pieces are large and usually contain multiple sections. The traditional pieces however often have a standard metrical length of 68 measures or beat, and these may be joined to form the larger pieces &quot;dagu&quot;.

Famous solo pieces now performed include:

Most of the above are traditional compositions dating to the Qing dynasty or early 20th century, new pieces however are constantly being composed, and most of them follow a more Western structure. Examples of popular modern works composed after the 1950s are &quot;Dance of the Yi People&quot; and &quot;Heroic Little Sisters of the Grassland&quot; (草原英雄小姐妹). Non-traditional themes may be used in these new compositions and some may reflect the political landscape and demands at the time of composition, for example &quot;Dance of the Yi People&quot; which is based on traditional melodies of the Yi people, may be seen as part of the drive for national unity, while &quot;Heroic Little Sisters of the Grassland&quot; extols the virtue of those who served as model of exemplary behaviour in the People&#x27;s commune.

==Schools==

There are a number of different traditions with different styles of playing pipa in various regions of China, some of which then developed into schools. In the narrative traditions where the pipa is used as an accompaniment to narrative singing, there are the Suzhou &quot;tanci&quot; (蘇州彈詞), Sichuan &quot;qingyin&quot; (四川清音), and Northern &quot;quyi&quot; (北方曲藝) genres. Pipa is also an important component of regional chamber ensemble traditions such as Jiangnan sizhu, Teochew string music and Nanguan ensemble. In Nanguan music, the pipa is still held in the near-horizontal position or guitar-fashion in the ancient manner instead of the vertical position normally used for solo playing in the present day.

There were originally two major schools of pipa during the Qing dynasty—the Northern (Zhili, 直隸派) and Southern (Zhejiang, 浙江派) schools—and from these emerged the five main schools associated with the solo tradition. Each school is associated with one or more collections of pipa music and named after its place of origin:

* Wuxi school (無錫派) – associated with the &quot;Hua Collection&quot; by Hua Qiuping, who studied with Wang Junxi (王君錫) of the Northern school and Chen Mufu (陳牧夫) of the Southern school, and may be considered a synthesis of these two schools of the Qing dynasty. As the first published collection, the &quot;Hua Collection&quot; had considerable influence on later pipa players.
* Pudong school (浦東派) – associated with the &quot;Ju Collection&quot; (鞠氏譜) which is based on an 18th-century handwritten manuscript, &quot;Xianxu Youyin&quot; (閑敘幽音), by Ju Shilin.
* Pinghu school (平湖派) – associated with the &quot;Li Collection&quot; (李氏譜) first published in 1895; it was compiled by Li Fangyuan who came from a family of many generations of &quot;pipa&quot; players.
* Chongming school (崇明派) – associated with &quot;Old Melodies of Yingzhou&quot; (瀛洲古調) compiled by Shen Zhaozhou (沈肇州, 1859–1930) in 1916.
* Shanghai or Wang school (汪派) – named after Wang Yuting (汪昱庭) who created this style of playing. It may be considered a synthesis of the other four schools especially the Pudong and Pinghu schools. Wang did not publish his notation book in his lifetime, although handwritten copies were passed on to his students.

These schools of the solo tradition emerged by students learning to play the pipa from their master, and each school has its own style, performance aesthetics, notation system, and may differ in their playing techniques. Different schools have different repertoire in their music collection, and even though these schools share many of the same pieces in their repertoire, a same piece of music from the different schools may differ in their content. For example, a piece like &quot;The Warlord Takes off His Armour&quot; is made up of many sections, some of them metered and some with free meter, and greater freedom in interpretation is possible in the free meter sections. Different schools however can have sections added or removed, and may differ in the number of sections with free meter. The music collections from the 19th century also used the gongche notation which provides only a skeletal melody and approximate rhythms sometimes with the occasional playing instructions given (such as tremolo or string-bending), and how this basic framework can become fully fleshed out during a performance may only be learnt by the students from the master. The same piece of music can therefore differ significantly when performed by students of different schools, with striking differences in interpretation, phrasing, tempo, dynamics, playing techniques, and ornamentations.

In more recent times, many pipa players, especially the younger ones, no longer identify themselves with any specific school. Modern notation systems, new compositions as well as recordings are now widely available and it is no longer crucial for a pipa players to learn from the master of any particular school to know how to play a score.

==Performers==
===Historical===

Pipa is commonly associated with Princess Liu Xijun and Wang Zhaojun of the Han dynasty, although the form of pipa they played in that period is unlikely to be pear-shaped as they are now usually depicted. Other early known players of &quot;pipa&quot; include General Xie Shang from the Jin dynasty who was described to have performed it with his leg raised on tiptoe. The introduction of pipa from Central Asia also brought with it virtuoso performers from that region, for example Sujiva (蘇祇婆, &quot;Sujipo&quot;) from the Kingdom of Kucha during the Northern Zhou dynasty, Kang Kunlun (康崑崙) from Kangju, and Pei Luoer (裴洛兒) from Shule. Pei Luoer was known for pioneering finger-playing techniques, while Sujiva was noted for the &quot;Seven modes and seven tones&quot;, a musical modal theory from India. (The heptatonic scale was used for a time afterwards in the imperial court due to Sujiva&#x27;s influence until it was later abandoned). These players had considerable influence on the development of &quot;pipa&quot; playing in China. Of particular fame were the family of &quot;pipa&quot; players founded by Cao Poluomen (曹婆羅門) and who were active for many generations from the Northern Wei to Tang dynasty.

Texts from Tang dynasty mentioned many renowned pipa players such as He Huaizhi (賀懷智), Lei Haiqing (雷海清), Li Guaner (李管兒), and Pei Xingnu (裴興奴). Duan Anjie described the duel between the famous pipa player Kang Kunlun and the monk Duan Shanben (段善本) who was disguised as a girl, and told the story of Yang Zhi (楊志) who learned how to play the pipa secretly by listening to his aunt playing at night. Celebrated performers of the Tang dynasty included three generations of the Cao family—Cao Bao (曹保), Cao Shancai (曹善才) and Cao Gang (曹剛), whose performances were noted in literary works.

During the Song dynasty, players mentioned in literary texts include Du Bin (杜彬). From the Ming dynasty, famous pipa players include Zhong Xiuzhi (鍾秀之), Zhang Xiong (張雄, known for his playing of &quot;Eagle Seizing Swan&quot;), the blind Li Jinlou (李近樓), and Tang Yingzeng (湯應曾) who was known to have played a piece that may be an early version of &quot;Ambushed from Ten Sides&quot;.

During the Qing dynasty, apart from those of the various schools previously mentioned, there was Chen Zijing (陳子敬), a student of Ju Shilin and known as a noted player during the late Qing dynasty.

===Modern era===
In the 20th century, two of the most prominent &quot;pipa&quot; players were Sun Yude (孙裕德; 1904–1981) and Li Tingsong (李廷松; 1906–1976). Both were pupils of Wang Yuting (1872–1951), and both were active in establishing and promoting &quot;Guoyue&quot; (&quot;national music&quot;), which is a combination of traditional regional music and Western musical practices. Sun performed in the United States, Asia, and Europe, and in 1956 became deputy director of the Shanghai Chinese Orchestra. As well as being one of the leading pipa players of his generation, Li held many academic positions and also carried out research on pipa scales and temperament. Wei Zhongle (卫仲乐; 1908－1997) played many instruments, including the &quot;guqin&quot;. In the early 1950s, he founded the traditional instruments department at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. Players from the Wang and Pudong schools were the most active in performance and recording during the 20th century, less active was the Pinghu school whose players include Fan Boyan (樊伯炎). Other noted players of the early 20th century include Liu Tianhua, a student of Shen Zhaozhou of the Chongming school and who increased the number of frets on the &quot;pipa&quot; and changed to an equal-tempered tuning, and the blind player Abing from Wuxi.

Lin Shicheng (林石城; 1922–2006), born in Shanghai, began learning music under his father and was taught by Shen Haochu (沈浩初; 1899–1953), a leading player in the Pudong school style of pipa playing. He also qualified as a doctor of Chinese medicine. In 1956, after working for some years in Shanghai, Lin accepted a position at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing. Liu Dehai (1937–2020), also born in Shanghai, was a student of Lin Shicheng and in 1961 graduated from the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing. Liu also studied with other musicians and has developed a style that combines elements from several different schools. Ye Xuran (叶绪然), a student of Lin Shicheng and Wei Zhongle, was the Pipa Professor at the first Musical Conservatory of China, the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. He premiered the oldest Dunhuang Pipa Manuscript (the first interpretation made by Ye Dong) in Shanghai in the early 1980s.

Other prominent students of Lin Shicheng at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing include Liu Guilian (刘桂莲, born 1961), Gao Hong and Wu Man. Wu Man, probably the best known &quot;pipa&quot; player internationally, received the first-ever master&#x27;s degree in pipa and won China&#x27;s first National Academic Competition for Chinese Instruments. She lives in San Diego, California and works extensively with Chinese, cross-cultural, new music, and jazz groups. Shanghai-born Liu Guilian graduated from the Central Conservatory of Music and became the director of the Shanghai Pipa Society, and a member of the Chinese Musicians Association and Chinese National Orchestral Society, before immigrating to Canada. She now performs with Red Chamber and the Vancouver Chinese Music Ensemble. Gao Hong graduated from the Central Conservatory of Music and was the first to do a joint tour with Lin Shicheng in North America. They recorded the critically acclaimed CD &quot;Eagle Seizing Swan&quot; together.

Noted contemporary pipa players who work internationally include Min Xiao-Fen, Zhou Yi, Qiu Xia He, Liu Fang, Cheng Yu, Jie Ma, Gao Hong, Yang Jing, Yang Wei (杨惟), Yang Jin (杨瑾), Guan Yadong (管亚东), Jiang Ting (蔣婷), Tang Liangxing (湯良興), and Lui Pui-Yuen (呂培原, brother of Lui Tsun-Yuen). Some other notable pipa players in China include Yu Jia (俞嘉), Wu Yu Xia (吳玉霞), Fang Jinlong (方錦龍) and Zhao Cong (赵聪).

==Use in contemporary classical music==

In the late 20th century, largely through the efforts of Wu Man (in USA), Min Xiao-Fen (in USA), composer Yang Jing (in Europe) and other performers, Chinese and Western contemporary composers began to create new works for the pipa (both solo and in combination with chamber ensembles and orchestra). Most prominent among these are Minoru Miki, Thüring Bräm, YANG Jing, Terry Riley, Donald Reid Womack, Philip Glass, Lou Harrison, Tan Dun, Bright Sheng, Chen Yi, Zhou Long, Bun-Ching Lam, and Carl Stone.

Cheng Yu researched the old Tang dynasty five-stringed pipa in the early 2000s and developed a modern version of it for contemporary use. It is very much the same as the modern pipa in construction save for being a bit wider to allow for the extra string and the reintroduction of the soundholes at the front. It has not caught on in China but in Korea (where she also did some of her research) the bipa was revived since then and the current versions are based on Chinese pipa, including one with five-strings. The 5 String Pipa is tuned like a Standard Pipa with the addition of an Extra Bass String tuned to an E2 (Same as the Guitar) which broadens the range (Tuning is E2, A2, D3, E3, A3). Jiaju Shen from The Either also plays an Electric 5 String Pipa/Guitar hybrid that has the Hardware from an Electric Guitar combined with the Pipa, built by an instrument maker named Tim Sway called &quot;Electric Pipa 2.0&quot;.

==Use in other genres==
The pipa has also been used in rock music; the California-based band Incubus featured one, borrowed from guitarist Steve Vai, in their 2001 song &quot;Aqueous Transmission,&quot; as played by the group&#x27;s guitarist, Mike Einziger. The Shanghai progressive/folk-rock band Cold Fairyland, which was formed in 2001, also use &quot;pipa&quot; (played by Lin Di), sometimes multi-tracking it in their recordings. Australian dark rock band The Eternal use the &quot;pipa&quot; in their song &quot;Blood&quot; as played by singer/guitarist Mark Kelson on their album &quot;Kartika&quot;. The artist Yang Jing plays &quot;pipa&quot; with a variety of groups. The instrument is also played by musician Min Xiaofen in &quot;I See Who You Are&quot;, a song from Björk&#x27;s album &quot;Volta&quot;. Western performers of pipa include French musician Djang San, who integrated jazz and rock concepts to the instrument such as power chords and walking bass.

==Electric pipa==

The electric pipa was first developed in the late 20th century by adding electric guitar–style magnetic pickups to a regular acoustic pipa, allowing the instrument to be amplified through an instrument amplifier or PA system.

A number of Western pipa players have experimented with amplified pipa. Brian Grimm placed the contact mic pickup on the face of the pipa and wedged under the bridge so he is able to plug into pedalboards, live computer performance rigs, and direct input (DI) to an audio interface for studio tracking. In 2014, French zhongruan player and composer Djang San, created his own electric pipa and recorded an experimental album that puts the electric pipa at the center of music. He was also the first musician to add a strap to the instrument, as he did for the zhongruan, allowing him to play the pipa and the zhongruan like a guitar.

In 2014, an industrial designer residing in the United States Xi Zheng (郑玺) designed and crafted an electric pipa – &quot;E-pa&quot; in New York. In 2015, pipa player Jiaju Shen (沈嘉琚) released a mini album composed and produced by Li Zong (宗立), with E-pa music that has a strong Chinese flavor within a modern Western pop music mould.

<text>The Progressive Party of Working People (, , ΑΚΕΛ or AKEL; ) is a Marxist–Leninist communist party in Cyprus.

AKEL is one of the two major parties in Cyprus, and it supports a federal solution of the internal aspect of the Cyprus problem and it places particular emphasis on rapprochement with the Turkish Cypriots. It supported entry into the European Union with certain reservations. Initially supportive of the Annan Plan in 2004, the AKEL ultimately opposed the plan because the UN Security Council did not provide guarantees on post-reunification security.

As a strong supporter of welfare benefits and nationalization, AKEL successfully put into practice several social measures to support the economic welfare of Cypriots during the Great Recession, such as increasing low pensions by 30% and strengthening the welfare benefits given to university students to €12 million per year. Overall, €1.2 billion were spent on welfare benefits during the first three years that AKEL was in power, with various improvements made in social welfare provision. The party has been in opposition since the 2013 election. The party&#x27;s candidate was defeated in the 2018 presidential election against the incumbent president. For the 2023 presidential election, the party supported independent candidate Andreas Mavroyiannis, who was also defeated.

==History==
It was founded in 1926 with the name Communist Party of Cyprus (CPC; , ). The communist party set as its aim not only the struggle against exploitation, but also the independence of Cyprus from British rule. The party became illegal in 1931 when the British colonial government-imposed restrictions on civil rights following the Cyprus revolt riot. In 1941, leading members of the underground communist party and others founded AKEL. In the first municipal elections in 1943 (before that mayors were appointed) AKEL candidates became mayors of Limassol (Ploutis Servas) and Famagusta (Adam Adamantos).

Unlike its predecessor, AKEL was not against Enosis. Instead, AKEL supported a gradual process, starting off with a constitution and self-government, while Cyprus would remain a colony, leading to self-determination and Enosis. After the failure of the consultative assembly in 1949 to grant a constitution acceptable to the Cypriot members, AKEL changed line, supporting immediate Enosis with no intermediate stages.

During the late 1950s, AKEL was opposed to the violent tactics followed by the anti-British resistance movement of EOKA. EOKA accused AKEL of being collaborators with the British, even though AKEL had also been illegal since 1955. Several AKEL members were assassinated by EOKA at the time for being &quot;traitors&quot;, including AKEL supporter Savas Menikou, who was stoned to death. AKEL denounced EOKA&#x27;s leadership as being anti-communist, as its leader George Grivas had fought against the communist side during the Greek Civil War. Grivas later founded EOKA B, which supported the 1974 coup d&#x27;état following his death.

About 1958, the Turkish Cypriot nationalist organization TMT started forcing Turkish Cypriots members of AKEL to leave. Editor of a workers&#x27; newspaper Fazıl Önder was killed and the head of the Turkish bureau of PEO (AKEL&#x27;s trade union) Ahmet Sadi moved to the UK to save his life.

In the first presidential elections for independent Cyprus, AKEL backed Ioannis Kliridis (father of Glafkos Klerides) against Makarios III. The last Turkish Cypriot to be a member of the central committee of AKEL, Derviş Ali Kavazoğlu, was killed by TMT in 1965.

In the mid 1960s the U.S. State Department estimated the party membership to be approximately 10,000 (3.25% of the working age population).

===Recent history===

At the legislative elections on 27 May 2001, the party won 34.7% of the popular vote and 20 out of 56 seats. After this election, AKEL&#x27;s General Secretary, Dimitris Christofias, was elected as President of the House of Representatives, serving in that post until 2006. His election was supported by AKEL, Movement for Social Democracy (EDEK), and the Democratic Party (DIKO).

AKEL is a member of the European United Left - Nordic Green Left political group in the European Parliament, and it is considered to be moderately eurosceptic. Cyprus joined the EU in 2004, and in the 2004 European parliament election, AKEL elected two members (Adamos Adamou and Kyriacos Triantaphyllides).

AKEL remained the largest political party in the 2006 legislative elections; however, the party lost two seats, winning 18 seats with 31.31% of the vote.

In the second round presidential election held on 24 February 2008, Dimitris Christofias, General Secretary of AKEL, was elected President of Cyprus. Christofias won 53.36% of the vote against his right-wing opponent Ioannis Kasoulidis&#x27; 46.64%.

On 21 January 2009, Andros Kyprianou was elected general secretary of the party with 54.3% in the central committee election.

In the 2009 election to the European Parliament, AKEL received 34.9% of the votes, and again elected two out of Cyprus&#x27; six members (Kyriacos Triantaphyllides and Takis Hadjigeorgiou). In the 2014 election, they held their two seats with a reduced 27% of the vote.

In the 22 May 2011 legislative election AKEL received 32.67% of the votes, and elected 19 out of the 56 members of parliament.

In an interview with Athens News Agency, party leader Andros Kyprianou said that AKEL was considering Cyprus&#x27; exit from the eurozone, saying, &quot;It is an option on the table&quot;, but that it will require &quot;study and planning&quot;.

In the 2013 presidential election, Stavros Malas, who was supported by AKEL lost by a margin of 42.52% to 57.48%. In the 2018 presidential election, conservative president Nicos Anastasiades won a second five-year term with 56 percent of the vote. The AKEL-backed independent candidate, Stavros Malas, lost the election with 44 percent.

In 2016 legislative election AKEL was the second largest party with 25.7 percent of the vote, 7 percent less than the previous election.

Niyazi Kızılyürek was elected to the European Parliament in 2019 for AKEL, making him the first Turkish-Cypriot to enter the European Parliament and thus breaking what was considered a taboo on the island. AKEL advocates the creation of a federal state in which Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots would live together.

==Youth==

The party&#x27;s youth wing is the United Democratic Youth Organisation, which was founded in 1959.

<text>Thixendale is a village and civil parish in North Yorkshire, England. Historically part of the East Riding of Yorkshire, it is located in the Yorkshire Wolds about 20 miles east of York.

The place name &quot;Thixendale&quot; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &quot;Sixtendale&quot; and &quot;Xistendale&quot;. The name means &#x27;Sigstein&#x27;s Dale or Valley&#x27;. The name &quot;Sigstein&quot; is also the source for the name of Sysonby in Leicestershire.

In 2016, the North Yorkshire County Council estimated the population of the parish to be 200.

The only pub, the Cross Keys, is a regular winner of local CAMRA awards.

The Yorkshire Wolds Way National Trail, a long-distance footpath, passes to the east end of the village.

The church of St Mary, Thixendale is one of a group of village buildings according to designs by George Edmund Street in 1868–1870. It was designated in 1966 by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. It is on the Sykes Churches Trail devised by the East Yorkshire Historic Churches Group.

For many years until the late 1990s, television signals were blocked by the surrounding hills until a small transmitter was built, providing the village with terrestrial television for the first time. The transmitter ceased operation in the early 2000s, with villagers now relying on satellite TV and, since 2017, fast broadband.

<text>Charles Barry Jr. (1823–1900) was an English architect of the mid-late 19th century, and eldest son of Sir Charles Barry. Like his younger brother and fellow architect Edward Middleton Barry, Charles Jr. designed numerous buildings in London. He is particularly associated with works in the south London suburb of Dulwich.

Charles Jr. worked extensively on projects in London and East Anglia with fellow architect Robert Richardson Banks (1812–72), working from an office in Sackville Street, and then collaborated with his shorter-lived brother Edward on several schemes.

==Projects==

Charles Sr. had been architect and surveyor to Dulwich College, designing the Old Grammar School (an 1842 establishment for the education of poor boys from Dulwich and Camberwell), among other buildings. Charles Jr. then succeeded his father in the role. He designed the New College (1866–70) – a building of red brick and white stone, designed in a hybrid of Palladian and Gothic styles.

His other projects include:

* The Cliff Town Estate, Southend, Essex (with Banks)
* Bylaugh Hall, Norfolk (1849–1852, with Banks)
* Lady Wimborne Estate Cottages, Canford Magna, Ashington, and Poole, Dorset, (1849, with Banks)
* The Pump House in the Italian Gardens, Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens, (1860, with Banks)
* St Saviour&#x27;s Church, Harome (1861-1862)
* The Crystal Palace (High Level) railway station (1863-1865, demolished 1961) and the surviving Crystal Palace Subway
* The forecourt of Burlington House (home of the Royal Academy), in Piccadilly, including the apartments of the Geological Society of London, Linnean Society of London, Royal Astronomical Society, Royal Society of Chemistry, and Society of Antiquaries of London (1869–73, with Banks).St Stephen&#x27;s Church, south Dulwich (1867–75)
*Stevenstone House, Devon (1868–72)
*Mausoleum of Wynn Ellis, Whitstable (1872)
*All Saints Church, Whitstable, rebuilding (1875–76)
*Clumber Park, Nottinghamshire, (1879)
* Chancel and pulpit of St Peter&#x27;s Church, Kensington Park Road, London (1879)
* New chambers at Inner Temple, London (1879; with Edward)
* Great Eastern Hotel, Liverpool Street station, London (1884; the design was a collaboration with his brother Edward who died in 1880 before it was finished)
* Dulwich Park (1884)

Charles Jr. was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1876, and was a member of the Society&#x27;s Council in 1878. He was President of the Royal Institute of British Architects from 1876-79. He was also awarded the prestigious RIBA Royal Gold Medal in 1877. His pupils included Sir Aston Webb (himself a later President of the RIBA and winner of the Royal Gold Medal).

==Family==
He lived in a large villa &quot;Lapsewood&quot; in Sydenham Hill. His son was Lt Col Arthur John Barry CBE, TD, MICE (b. 21 November 1859), civil engineer and architect. A. J. Barry collaborated on major international engineering projects with his uncle, Charles Jr.&#x27;s brother John Wolfe-Barry, and Bradford Leslie and was the author of &quot;Railway Expansion in China and the Influence of Foreign Powers in its Development&quot; [London, 1910].

<text>Rudolf Schuster (born 4 January 1934) is a Slovak politician, who served as the second president of Slovakia from 1999 to 2004. He was elected on 29 May 1999 and inaugurated on 15 June. In the presidential elections of April 2004, in which he sought re-election, Schuster was defeated. He received only 7.4% of the vote, with three other candidates (more specifically Ivan Gašparovič, Vladimír Mečiar, and Eduard Kukan) receiving more than that. He was succeeded by Ivan Gašparovič.

==Life and career==
Schuster was born in Košice. From 1964 to 1990, he was a member of the Communist Party of Slovakia. Before becoming president, he was Mayor (Slovak: &quot;primátor&quot;) of Košice in 1983–1986 and 1994–1999 respectively. He was also the last Communist president of the Slovak National Council (1989–1990), Ambassador of Czechoslovakia to Canada (1990–1992) and a leader of the Party of Civic Understanding (&quot;SOP – Strana občianskeho porozumenia&quot;, 1998–1999).

Schuster speaks German (including Mantak dialect), Slovak, Czech, Russian, English and Hungarian fluently.

Schuster&#x27;s father&#x27;s family is of Carpathian German origin, while his mother&#x27;s family is of Hungarian origin. Rudolf Schuster was married in 1961 to Irena Trojáková (died 2008) and he has two children (son Peter and daughter Ingrid) and two granddaughters. In his private life, he is a sports fan, a traveller and a writer. He is also a camera fan.

In 1998, Schuster founded the centre-left Party of Civic Understanding. In 1999 he received honorary citizenship from Miskolc, as recognition of the good cooperation between the city and Košice during his mayorship.
In 2004, Schuster sought re-election in the 2004 presidential election and received 7.4% of the votes.

== Writing ==
Rudolf Schuster is a member of the Association of Slovak Writers. He has been author of film scripts for various television films. His most famous works are detective novels and travelogues mainly about Brazil and Canada.

 (Meirion, with as a Welsh suffix of land, literally &#x27;Land adjoined to Meirion&#x27;) was a sub-kingdom of Gwynedd, founded according to legend by Meirion (derived from the Latin name ), a grandson of Cunedda, a warrior-prince who brought his family to Wales from the (the &#x27;Old North&#x27;, northern England and southern Scotland today), probably in the early 5th century. His dynasty seems to have ruled there for the next four hundred years. The kingdom lay between the River Mawddach and the River Dovey, spreading in a north-easterly direction.

==Cantref==
The ancient name of the was (or &#x27;the of the Ordovices&#x27;). The familiar name coming from Meirion&#x27;s kingdom.

The of held the presumed boundaries of the previous kingdom but now as a fief of the Kingdom of Gwynedd where it continued to enjoy long spells of relative independence. It was divided into the commotes of (administered from at ) and (possibly centred on where there is a mound). The was effectively abolished in 1284 following the Statute of Rhuddlan with the area being reorganised with the addition of some neighbouring to form the county of Merionethshire.

==County==
The area of Meirionnydd was enlarged under the Statute of to become a county, gaining the old of and (shown as Dunoding in the map of medieval cantrefi). The name for the county was anglicised to the English phonetic equivalent of &quot;Merioneth&quot;, sometimes appearing with the suffix &quot;-shire&quot; as &quot;Merionethshire&quot;.

Merioneth became an administrative county with an elected county council in 1889 under the Local Government Act 1888. In 1974 the administrative county was abolished with most of the area merging with Caernarfonshire and Anglesey to create a new county of Gwynedd.

==District==

The 1974 reforms established a two-tier system, with upper-tier county councils and lower-tier district councils. The county of Gwynedd was divided into five districts, one of which was called , reverting to the Welsh spelling of the name &quot;Merioneth&quot;. The district of covered almost the same area as the pre-1974 county of Merioneth, excluding only the Rural District, which went to the district of Clwyd. The Meirionnydd district replaced eight former districts:
* Bala Urban District
* Barmouth Urban District
* Deudraeth Rural District
* Dolgellau Rural District
* Dolgellau Urban District
* Ffestiniog Urban District
* Penllyn Rural District
* Tywyn Urban District

Under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, the previous two-tier system of counties and districts was replaced with new principal areas (each designated either a &quot;county&quot; or a &quot;county borough&quot;), whose councils perform the functions previously divided between the county and district councils. The area merged with the neighbouring Arfon and Dwyfor districts to become a county, which the government originally named &quot;Caernarfonshire and Merionethshire&quot;. During the transition to the new system, the shadow authority requested a change of name from &quot;Caernarfonshire and Merionethshire&quot; to . The government confirmed the change with effect from 2 April 1996, one day after the new council came into being.

Since 1996, Gwynedd Council has used the former Meirionnydd district as a committee area for discussing local matters.

===Political control===
The first election to Meirionnydd District Council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 1 April 1974. Throughout the council&#x27;s existence a majority of the seats on the council were held by independents:
===Premises===
The district council was based at in , which had been built in 1953 as the headquarters of the old Merioneth County Council. Since 1996 the building has served as an area office of Gwynedd Council.

<text>Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, sometimes referred to simply as Brewer&#x27;s, is a reference work containing definitions and explanations of many famous phrases, allusions, and figures, whether historical or mythical.

The &quot;New Edition revised, corrected, and enlarged&quot; from 1895 is now in the public domain, and Web-based versions are available online.

The most recent version is the 20th edition, published in November 2018 by Chambers Harrap Publishers.

==History==
Originally published in 1870 by Cassell, Petter &amp; Galpin and written by the Reverend E. Cobham Brewer, it was aimed at the growing number of people who wanted to understand the origins of phrases and historical or literary allusions, but did not have a university education. The &#x27;phrase&#x27; part of the title refers mainly to the explanation of various idioms and proverbs, while the &quot;fable&quot; part might more accurately be labelled &quot;folklore&quot; and ranges from classical mythology to relatively recent literature. On top of this, Brewer added notes on important historical figures and events, and other things which he thought would be of interest, such as Roman numerals. Brewer&#x27;s provides information often not included in more traditional dictionaries and encyclopaedias. A &quot;New Edition revised, corrected, and enlarged&quot; of 1440 pages was published by the author in 1895, not long before he died. Since then, it has been continually republished; in revised and updated editions.

This retitled and updated version, initially edited by Adrian Room, was first published in 2000 (). A second edition (), edited by Ian Crofton and John Ayto, was published on 30 November 2010. While this title is based on the structure of &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable&quot;, it contains entries from 1900 onwards and exists alongside its parent volume as a separate work.

==Other special editions==

A variety of spin-off editions have been published in the past, some straying quite far from the theme of &#x27;phrase and fable&#x27;, such as &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of Cinema&quot; (1997) and William Donaldson&#x27;s A–Z of &#x27;roguish Britons&#x27;, &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Rogues, Villains and Eccentrics&quot; (2002). &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of London Phrase and Fable&quot; was published in 2009 and &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of Irish Phrase and Fable&quot; was reissued at the same time.

<doc id="356707" wikidata="Q913567" url="?curid=356707" title="Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia">
<text>The Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (, KSČM) is a communist party in the Czech Republic. As of 2022, KSČM has a membership of 20,450. Sources variously describe the party as either left-wing or far-left on the political spectrum. It is one of the few former ruling parties in post-Communist Central Eastern Europe to have not dropped the &quot;Communist&quot; title from its name, although it has changed its party program to adhere to laws adopted after 1989. It was previously a member party of The Left group in the European Parliament, and an observer member of the European Left Party, but is now unaffiliated. 

For most of the first two decades after the Velvet Revolution, the party was politically isolated and accused of extremism, but later moved closer to the Czech Social Democratic Party (ČSSD). After the 2012 Czech regional elections, KSČM began governing in coalition with the ČSSD in 10 regions. It has never been part of a governing coalition in the executive branch but provided parliamentary support to Andrej Babiš&#x27; Second Cabinet until April 2021. The party&#x27;s youth organization was banned from 2006 to 2010, and there have been calls from other parties to outlaw the main party. Until 2013, it was the only political party in the Czech Republic printing its own newspaper, called &quot;Haló noviny&quot;. The party&#x27;s two cherry logo comes from the song &quot;Le Temps des cerises&quot;, a revolutionary song associated with the Paris Commune.

== History ==
The party was formed in 1989 by a congress of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ), which decided to create a party for the territories of Bohemia and Moravia (including Czech Silesia), the areas that were to become the Czech Republic. The new party&#x27;s organization was significantly more democratic and decentralized than the previous party, and gave local district branches of the party significant autonomy.

In 1990, KSČ was reorganized as a federation of KSČM and the Communist Party of Slovakia (KSS). Later, KSS changed its name to the Party of the Democratic Left, and the federation dissolved in 1992. During the party&#x27;s first congress, held in Olomouc in October 1990, party leader Jiří Svoboda attempted to reform the party into a democratic socialist one, proposing a democratic socialist program and changing the name to the transitional Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia: Party of Democratic Socialism. Svoboda had to balance the criticisms of older, conservative communists, who made up a majority of the party&#x27;s members, with the demands of an increasingly large and moderate bloc of members, led primarily by a group of young KSČM parliamentarians called the Democratic Left, who demanded the immediate social democratization of the party. Delegates approved the new program but rejected the name change.

During 1991 and 1992, factional tensions increased, with the party&#x27;s conservative, anti-revisionist wing increasingly vocal in criticizing Svoboda. There was an increase in popularity of the anti-revisionist Marxist–Leninist clubs amongst rank-and-file party members. On the party&#x27;s other wing, the Democratic Left became increasingly critical of the slow pace of the reforms and began demanding a referendum of members to change the name. In December 1991, the Democratic Left split off and formed the short-lived Party of Democratic Labour. The referendum on changing the name was held in 1992, with 75.94% voting not to change the name.

The party&#x27;s second congress, held in Kladno in December 1992, showed the increasing popularity of the party&#x27;s anti-revisionist wing. It passed resolutions reinterpreting the 1990 program as a &quot;starting point&quot; for KSČM, rather than a definitive statement of a post-communist program. Svoboda, who was hospitalized due to an attack by an anti-communist, could not attend the congress but was nevertheless overwhelmingly re-elected. After the party&#x27;s second congress in 1992, several groups split away. A group of post-communist delegates split off and merged with the Party of Democratic Labour to form the Party of the Democratic Left (SDL). Several independent left-wing members who had participated with KSČM in the 1992 electoral pact, which was called the Left Bloc, left the party to form the Left Bloc Party. Both groups eventually merged into the Party of Democratic Socialism.

In 1993, Svoboda attempted to expel the members of the &quot;For Socialism&quot; platform, a group in the party that wanted a restoration of the pre-1989 Communist regime; however, with only the lukewarm support of KSČM&#x27;s central committee, he briefly resigned. He withdrew his resignation after the central committee agreed to move the party&#x27;s next congress forward to June 1993 to resolve the issues of its name and ideology. At the 1993 congress, held in Prostějov, Svoboda&#x27;s proposals were overwhelmingly rejected by two-thirds majorities. Svoboda did not seek re-election as chairman, and neocommunist Miroslav Grebeníček was elected chairman. Grebeníček and his supporters were critical of what they termed the inadequacies of the pre-1989 regime but supported the retention of the party&#x27;s communist character and program. The members of the &quot;For Socialism&quot; platform were expelled at the congress, with the existence of platforms in the party being banned altogether, on the grounds that they gave too much influence to minority groups. Svoboda left the party.

The expelled members of &quot;For Socialism&quot; formed the Party of Czechoslovak Communists, later renamed the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, which was led by Miroslav Štěpán. KSČM refuses to work with this group. The party was left on the sidelines for most of the first decade of the Czech Republic&#x27;s existence. Václav Havel suspected KSČM was still an unreconstructed neo-Stalinist party and prevented it from having any influence during his presidency; however, the party provided the one-vote margin that elected Havel&#x27;s successor Václav Klaus as president. After a long-running battle with the Ministry of the Interior, the Communist Youth Union led by Milan Krajča, was dissolved in 2006 for allegedly endorsing in its program the replacement of private with collective ownership of the means of production. The decision met with international protests.

In November 2008, the Czech Senate asked the Supreme Administrative Court to dissolve KSČM because of its political program, which the Senate argued contradicted the Constitution of the Czech Republic. 30 out of the 38 senators who were present agreed to this request, and expressed the view that the party&#x27;s program did not reject violence as a means of attaining power and adopted &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; of Karl Marx; however, this was only a symbolic gesture, as according to the constitution only the cabinet may file a petition to the Supreme Administrative Court to dissolve a political party. For the first two decades after the end of Communist rule in Czechoslovakia, the party was politically isolated. After the 2012 Czech regional elections, it started participating in coalitions with the Czech Social Democratic Party, forming part of the ruling coalition in 10 out of 13 regions. From 2018 to 2021, KSČM provided parliamentary support to Andrej Babiš&#x27; Second Cabinet.

After the party&#x27;s poor performance in the 2021 Czech legislative election, in which KSČM failed to reach the 5% voting threshold and was excluded from representation in parliament for the first time in its history, Filip resigned as leader of the party. On 23 October 2021, Member of European Parliament Kateřina Konečná was elected as leader.

== Ideology ==
As a communist party and the successor of the former ruling Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, its party platform promotes anti-capitalism and socialism through a Marxist lens. It holds Eurosceptic views in regards to the European Union.

== Leaders ==
== Electoral results ==
KSČM&#x27;s strongest bases of support are in the regions hit by deindustrialization, particularly in the Karlovy Vary and Ústí nad Labem regions. In 2012, the party won a regional election for the first time in Ústí nad Labem. Its regional leader Oldřich Bubeníček subsequently became the first communist regional governor in the history of Czech Republic. The party is stronger among older than younger voters, with the majority of its membership over 60. The party is also stronger in small and medium-sized towns than in big cities.

<text>Herod Antipas (, &quot;Hērṓidēs Antípas&quot;; ) was a 1st-century ruler of Galilee and Perea. He bore the title of tetrarch (&quot;ruler of a quarter&quot;) and is referred to as both &quot;Herod the Tetrarch&quot; and &quot;King Herod&quot; in the New Testament. He was a son of Herod the Great and a grandson of Antipater the Idumaean. He is widely known today for accounts in the New Testament of his role in events that led to the executions of John the Baptist and Jesus of Nazareth (, ).

Following the death of his father (4 BC in Schürer&#x27;s 1890 publication, 1 BC in much of the more recent scholarship, such as Jack Finegan, W. E. Filmer, and Andrew Steinmann), Herod Antipas was recognized as tetrarch by Caesar Augustus and subsequently by his brother, the ethnarch Herod Archelaus. Antipas officially ruled Galilee and Perea as a client state of the Roman Empire. He was responsible for building projects at Sepphoris and Betharamphtha, and for the construction of his capital Tiberias on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. Named in honour of his patron, the emperor Tiberius, the city later became a centre of rabbinic learning after the Jewish-Roman wars.

Antipas divorced his first wife Phasa&#x27;el, the daughter of King Aretas IV of Nabatea, in favour of Herodias, who had formerly been married to his half-brother Herod II. (Antipas was Herod the Great&#x27;s son by Malthace, while Herod II was his son by Mariamne II.) According to the New Testament Gospels, it was John the Baptist&#x27;s condemnation of this arrangement that led Antipas to have him arrested; John was subsequently put to death in Machaerus. Besides provoking his conflict with John the Baptist, the tetrarch&#x27;s divorce added a personal grievance to previous disputes with Aretas over territory on the border of Perea and Nabatea. The result was a war that proved disastrous for Antipas; a Roman counter-offensive was ordered by Tiberius but abandoned upon that emperor&#x27;s death in 37. In 39 Antipas was accused by his nephew Agrippa I of conspiracy against Emperor Caligula, who sent him into exile in Gaul, according to Josephus. Accompanied there by Herodias, he died at an unknown date.

The Gospel of Luke states that Jesus was first brought before Pontius Pilate for trial, since Pilate was the governor of Roman Judea, which encompassed Jerusalem where Jesus was arrested. Pilate initially handed him over to Antipas, in whose territory Jesus had been most active, but Antipas sent him back to Pilate&#x27;s court.

==Early life==
Antipas was a son of Herod the Great, who had become king of Judea, and Malthace, who was from Samaria. His date of birth is unknown but was before 20 BC. Antipas, his full brother Archelaus, and his half-brother Philip were educated in Rome.

Antipas was not Herod&#x27;s first choice of heir. That honour fell to Aristobulus and Alexander, Herod&#x27;s sons by the Hasmonean princess Mariamne. It was only after they were executed (c. 7 BC), and Herod&#x27;s oldest son Antipater was convicted of trying to poison his father (5 BC), that Herod fell back on his youngest son Antipas, revising his will to make him heir. During his final illness, Herod had yet another change of heart about the succession. According to the final version of his will, Antipas&#x27; elder brother Archelaus was to become king of Judea, Idumea, and Samaria, while Antipas would rule Galilee and Perea with the lesser title of tetrarch. Philip was to receive Iturea, Trachonitis, Batanea, Gaulanitis, Auranitis, and Paneas also with the title of tetrarch.

Because of Judea&#x27;s status as a Roman client kingdom, Herod&#x27;s plans for the succession had to be ratified by Emperor Augustus. The three heirs therefore travelled to Rome to make their claims, Antipas arguing he ought to inherit the whole kingdom and the others maintaining that Herod&#x27;s final will ought to be honoured. Despite qualified support for Antipas from Herodian family members in Rome—who favoured direct Roman rule of Judea but considered Antipas preferable to his brother—Augustus largely confirmed the division of territory set out by Herod in his final will. Archelaus gained the title of ethnarch rather than king.

==Reign==
===6/5 BC &quot;de jure&quot;, 1 BC &quot;de facto&quot; to AD 39===
Recent studies of the coins of Herod Antipas provide a more accurate dating of his years of reign than was previously possible. The highest number on those coins of that bear a year-number is 43, indicating that he claimed to have exercised his authority for 43 years. The termination of these 43 years can be determined quite accurately, as follows:
His [Antipas&#x27;s] wife Herodias was jealous of the honors given to her brother Herod Agrippa, honors above those of her husband Antipas, and so she persuaded Antipas to go to Rome to seek equal honors from Gaius Caesar (Caligula). Agrippa turned Caligula against Antipas, so that Caligula banished him and his wife. This would have to be year 43 of Antipas, because he has coins dating to year 43. The banishment must have been before the fall of AD 39, because Caligula left for Gaul in the fall of that year, not returning until August 31, AD 40. The encounter between Caligula and Antipas could not have occurred after Caligula&#x27;s return from Gaul (i.e., after August of AD 40), because Antipas was not involved in the trouble over Caligula&#x27;s statue for the Jerusalem temple that is related by Josephus and Philo (&quot;Legatio ad Galium&quot;) after his account of the deposition of Antipas.
From this determination it might be thought that the beginning of Antipas&#x27;s tetrarchy could be determined quite simply by calculating a date 43 years earlier than the end of his reign sometime in AD 39, but before the autumn of that year. But the calculation is complicated by several issues that must be settled before the calculation is done: 1) Was Antipas calculating his 43 years according to the Roman calendar year that began in January, or was he using the Judean calendar? 2) If he was using the Judean calendar, did that calendar reckon the regnal year for kings to start in the lunar month of Nisan in the spring (March/April), or in Tishri in the fall (September/October)? 3) When counting years of reign, did the Judean kings and tetrarchs using inclusive (also called non-accession) numbering, or non-inclusive (accession) reckoning?

The answer to question 1) is fairly simple: Virtually all scholars agree that the Herodians, and Josephus who is the main source for their lives, always used Judean years, not Roman, when dating Judean reigns. When referring to the reigns of Roman emperors, he used the Roman system. 
The answer to question 2) is quite straightforward: In affairs of government, such as the regnal years of Judean kings or tetrarchs, a Tishri-based year was used. That Judeans in the first century BC and the first century AD used a Tishri-based calendar for governmental affairs, which would include the reigns of Judean kings and tetrarchs, is made explicit by Josephus in &quot;Antiquities&quot; 1.81/1.3.3: 
After relating that Moses instituted Nisan as the first month for festivals and &quot;everything related to divine worship,&quot; he [Josephus] continues: . . . &quot;concerning, however, buying (&quot;praseis&quot;) and selling (&quot;onas&quot;) and the other financial administration [or tax administration] (&quot;dioikasin&quot;) he [Moses] preserved the earlier arrangement.&quot; The lexicons give the meaning of &quot;dioikasis&quot; as &quot;administration, management,&quot; or &quot;control, government, administration, treasury department.&quot; There is no meaning of &quot;ordinary affairs&quot; as rendered by Whiston and later Thackeray. By using the word &quot;dioikasis&quot;, Josephus clearly meant that the affairs of government (administration) were according to a Tishri-based calendar, and it is unfortunate that Thackeray apparently followed Whiston in rendering this Greek word in English. Josephus was stating that all activities other than those related to divinely mandated religious observances would be reckoned by a fall calendar that started with the first day of Tishri.

It is also unfortunate that Emil Schürer, in his study of the Herodian period, assumed that Josephus and the Judean rulers used a Nisan-based year, contradicting this passage in Josephus. On the same page, Schürer cites the Mishnah, a source much later than Josephus, which says that the regnal year for kings began on Nisan 1, a statement that not only contradicts the citation in Josephus, but also the meticulous works of Thiele and Coucke that showed that Judah always used a Tishri-based year in reckoning the reigns of its kings. That Josephus reckoned regnal years for the Herodians is also demonstrated in the research of Filmer, Finegan, and Steinmann.
Coucke, throughout his work just cited, introduced a notation that indicated clearly whether the regnal year under consideration was a Judean Tishri-based year or the Nisan-based regnal year used in the northern kingdom. A slight modification of that notation is used here: For a Nisan-based year that began in the (Roman/Julian) year AD 38, the notation will be AD 38n, that is, the year that began on Nisan 1 of AD 38 and ended the last day of Adar in AD 39. For a Tishri-based year, the notation AD 38t, as adopted by Young, Steinmann, and various other authors, will be used: AD 38t refers to the year that began in Tishri of AD 38 and ended the last day of Elul in AD 39.
The final issue to be settled before the beginning of Antipas reign can be calculated is whether Judean kings and tetrarchs using inclusive (also called non-accession) numbering, or non-inclusive (accession) reckoning. That issue should have been settled long ago, through the work of Filmer. Filmer cited six priestly rulers in the Hasmonean period, whose lengths or reign are given by Josephus (&quot;Ant. &quot; 13.228 to 14.97/13.7.4 to 14.6.1) as 8 years, 31 years, 1 year, 27 years, 9 years, and 3 and 1/2 year: Total 79 1/2 years. Filmer summarizes: &quot;If each of these reigns had been reckoned by the non-accession year system, the total would have exceeded the actual period by six years, and the fact that it does not do so proves that Josephus used the accession-year method.&quot;
That the accession-year method continued to be used in Judea after the Hasmonean period (second century BC) has received confirmation from a study of the coins of Herod and his successors. Among Herod&#x27;s minted coins, only one set has a year number, and that is the year number &quot;3&quot;. Numismatists are in general agreement that this refers to the year that Herod became &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Judean when his armies, and those of the Roman general Sossius, captured Jerusalem on the Day of Atonement, three years after he had been appointed king of Judea by the Roman Senate in either the Schürer system (fall 40 BC to fall 37 BC) or the dates of more recent scholarship (fall 39 BC to fall 36 BC). (Of these two alternatives, the latter is favored by Josephus&#x27;s statement (&quot;Ant&quot;. 14.457/14.16,4) that Jerusalem fell to the combined armies of Herod and Sossius on the Day of Atonement, 27 years to the day after the city fell to Pompeius the Great on the day of Atonement in 63 BC: 63 BC – 27 = 36 BC). Regarding accession vs. non-accession reckoning, Filmer pointed out that if Herod used a non-accession year on his year 3 coin, only two actual years would have passed:
It has been pointed out by B. Kanael that coins always express conditions &quot;de jure&quot; and not &quot;de facto&quot;, so that in this case they would be dated from Herod from Herod&#x27;s legal appointment in Rome, and not from his taking possession of Jerusalem. But the peculiar fact is that of all the coins of Herod&#x27;s reign, only those of the 3rd year are dated, and furthermore, appear to commemorate some event of great importance. This could only have been the capture of Jerusalem, for in the 3rd year after that event nothing of any consequence is known to have happened. The conclusion is that Herod, in minting these coins, wished to emphasize that he had already been king three years when he captured Jerusalem, and that his regnal years must be reckoned accordingly.
Herod&#x27;s year 3 coin is therefore not compatible with the non-accession method of counting regnal years that is crucial to the chronological system developed by Schürer, whether one uses Schürer&#x27;s dates for Herod&#x27;s appointment as king of Judea by the Roman Senate (40 BC) or the 39 BC of more recent scholarship.

The above discussion has shown that in order to calculate the year in which Herod Antipas considered as the start of his reign, the following data should be used.
#Antipas reckoned that his reign lasted 43 years, as attested by his year-43 coin.
#Antipas, in common with all the Herodians, and as reported by Josephus, considered each regnal year to begin in the fall month of Tishri. 
#From correlation with Roman history, notably the career of Gaius Caesar (Caligula), the 43rd year of Antipas ended before the fall season of AD 39. By Tishri reckoning, his final year was thus AD 38t.
#The Herodians used accession reckoning for their reigns, as established by Filmer, and quite definitely corroborated by the Year 3 coin of Herod the Great.
The calculation of the year in which Antipas began his reign is therefore: AD 38t – 43 – 1 (no year zero) = 6t BC. Notice that this is before the death of Herod in either the Schürer system (between Nisan 1 and Nisan 14 of 4 BC), and also in the system of Filmer, who calculated that, although Herod died between the lunar eclipse of January 9/10 of 1 BC and Passover of that year, his sons antedated their reigns back to 4 BC because they claimed their father shared some royal prerogatives and power with them at that time. The more exact math in this matter is given in indicated in the first sentence of this paragraph. It is also of interest that the date of 6t BC to which Antipas antedated his reign is the same Tishri-based year to which Philip the Tetrarch antedated his reign. Explaining why the ethnarchs antedated their reigns to a time before the death of Herod in either the Filmer or the Schürer chronologies, Andrew Steinmann writes,
Given the explicit statements of Josephus about the authority and honor Herod had granted his sons during the last years of his life, we can understand why all three of his successors [Archelaus, Antipas, and Philip] decided to antedate their reigns to the time when they were granted a measure of royal authority while their father was still alive. Although they were not officially recognized by Rome as ethnarch or tetrarchs until after Herod&#x27;s death, they nevertheless appear to have reckoned their reigns from 6t BC.

After the death of Herod the Great, Augustus confirmed the testament of the dead king by making Antipas tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, a region he ruled for 42 years. The two territories were separated by the region of the Decapolis, with Galilee to the north and Perea to the south. Threats to stability in both areas would have been clear to Antipas when he took office. While he had been making his case to Augustus in Rome, dissidents had attacked the palace of Sepphoris in Galilee, seizing money as well as weapons which they used to terrorize the area. In a counterattack ordered by Quinctilius Varus, Roman governor of Syria, Sepphoris was destroyed by fire and its inhabitants sold as slaves. Perea, meanwhile, bordered on the Kingdom of Nabatea, which had long had uneasy relations with Romans and Jews.

Part of Antipas&#x27; solution was to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a builder. He rebuilt and fortified Sepphoris, while also adding a wall to Betharamphtha in Perea. The latter city was renamed Livias after Augustus&#x27; wife Livia, and later Julias after his daughter. However, the tetrarch&#x27;s most noted construction was his capital on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee, Tiberias, so named to honour his patron Tiberius, who had succeeded Augustus as emperor in 14 AD. Residents could bathe nearby at the warm springs of Emmaus, and by the time of the First Jewish-Roman War the city&#x27;s buildings included a stadium, a royal palace, and a sanctuary for prayer. It gave its name to the sea and later became a centre of rabbinic learning after the Jewish-Roman wars. However, pious Jews at first refused to live in it because it was built atop a graveyard and therefore a source of ritual impurity. Antipas had to colonize it with a mixture of foreigners, forced migrants, poor people, and freed slaves.

At other times Antipas was more sensitive to Jewish tradition. His coins carried no images, which would have violated Jewish prescriptions against idolatry. When Pontius Pilate, governor of Judea from 26 to 36, caused offence by placing votive shields in the Antonia palace at Jerusalem, Antipas and his brothers successfully petitioned for their removal.

===John the Baptist and Jesus===

====Marriage to Herodias====
Early in his reign, Antipas had married Phasa&#x27;el, the daughter of King Aretas IV of Nabatea. However, on a visit to Rome he stayed with his half-brother Herod II and there he fell in love with his wife, Herodias, granddaughter of Herod the Great and Mariamne I, and the two agreed to marry after Herod Antipas had divorced his wife. Phasa&#x27;el learned of the plan and asked permission to travel to the frontier fortress of Machaerus, whence Nabatean forces escorted her to her father. With his daughter safe in his custody, Aretas declared war on Herod. Josephus states that Aretas was joined in this war by &quot;fugitives from the tetrarchy of Phillip&quot;, whereas Moses of Chorene states that Aretas was joined by the Edessan army. It is said that the joint Petra-Edessan army prevailed over the forces of Herod Antipas.

It is generally agreed that the war, in which Herod was defeated, occurred in 36, a year before the death of Tiberius. A point of contention today is how long before this date Herod&#x27;s marriage to Herodias took place. Some surmise that the marriage of Antipas and Herodias took place shortly before the war in about 34, after the death of Philip, but others have pointed to Josephus&#x27; &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; (Book 18, chapter 5, paragraph 4) comment that Herodias &quot;divorced herself from her husband while he was alive&quot; to argue that it took place before Herod II&#x27;s death, in about 27, thus making it possible for Jesus to have been born in the reign of Herod the Great (as indicated by the Gospel of Matthew) and to have died in his early 30s (as indicated by the Gospel of Luke).

====John&#x27;s ministry and execution====
Antipas faced more immediate problems in his own tetrarchy after John the Baptist (in 28/29 according to the Gospel of Luke or 27, if the co-regency of Augustus and Tiberius is included in Luke&#x27;s reckoning of time, for which there is some evidence) began a ministry of preaching and baptism by the Jordan River, which marked the western edge of Antipas&#x27; territory of Perea. The Gospels state that John attacked the tetrarch&#x27;s marriage as contrary to Jewish law (it was incestuous, as Herodias was also Antipas&#x27; niece, but also John criticized the fact that she was his brother&#x27;s wife (), lending credence to the belief that Antipas and Herodias married while Herod II was still alive), while Josephus says that John&#x27;s public influence made Antipas fearful of rebellion. 

John was imprisoned in Machaerus and later executed by beheading. According to Matthew and Mark, Herod was reluctant to order John&#x27;s death. However, during his birthday banquet, he had been so pleased by the dancing of Herodias&#x27; daughter (unnamed in the text but named by Josephus as Salome), he had sworn an oath and promised to grant whatever she asked. Her mother then prompted her to ask for John&#x27;s head on a platter. Compelled not to violate his oath to the girl or the guests, Antipas ordered John beheaded.

====Jesus&#x27; ministry and trial====
Among those baptized by John was Jesus of Nazareth, who began his own ministry in Galilee, causing Antipas, according to Matthew and Mark, to fear that John had been raised from the dead. Luke states that a group of Pharisees warn Jesus to flee because Antipas was plotting his death, whereupon Jesus denounces the tetrarch as a &quot;fox&quot; and declares that he, Jesus, would not fall victim to such a plot to run from heading towards Jerusalem because &quot;it cannot be that a prophet should perish away from Jerusalem&quot;. 

Luke also credits the tetrarch with a role in Jesus&#x27; trial. According to Luke, Pilate, on learning that Jesus was a Galilean and therefore under Herod&#x27;s jurisdiction, sent him to Antipas, who was also in Jerusalem at the time. Initially, Antipas was pleased to see Jesus, hoping to see him perform a miracle, but when Jesus remained silent in the face of questioning, Antipas mocked him and sent him back to Pilate. Luke states that these events improved relations between Pilate and Herod despite their earlier enmity.

The reason for Antipas&#x27; involvement has been debated. Theodor Mommsen argues that the normal legal procedure of the early Roman Empire was for defendants to be tried by the authorities of their home provinces. A. N. Sherwin-White re-examined the relevant legal texts and concluded that trials were generally based on the location of the alleged crimes, but that there was a possibility of referral to a province of origin in special cases. If Pilate was not required to send Jesus to Antipas, he may have been making a show of courtesy to the tetrarch and trying to avoid the need to deal with the Jewish authorities himself. When Jesus was sent back, Pilate could still have represented Antipas&#x27; failure to convict as support for his own view (according to Luke) that Jesus was not guilty of a capital offence, thus allowing him to avoid responsibility for Jesus&#x27; crucifixion.

With the lack of historical evidence, it has been suggested that Jesus&#x27; trial by Antipas is unhistorical. English historian Robin Lane Fox alleges that the story was invented based on Psalm 2, in which &quot;the kings of the earth&quot; are described as opposing the Lord&#x27;s &quot;anointed&quot;, and also served to show that the authorities failed to find grounds for convicting Jesus.

===Later reign===

Between 34 and 36 the conflict with Aretas of Nabatea—caused by Antipas&#x27; divorce from Aretas&#x27; daughter and the rulers&#x27; disagreement over territory—developed into open war. Antipas&#x27; army suffered a devastating defeat after fugitives from the former tetrarchy of Philip sided with the Nabateans, and Antipas was forced to appeal to Tiberius for help. The emperor ordered Lucius Vitellius, governor of Syria, to march against Aretas and ensure that he was captured or killed. Vitellius obediently mobilized two legions, sending them on a detour around Judea while he joined Antipas in attending a festival at Jerusalem. While staying there he learned of the death of Tiberius (16 March 37), concluded he lacked the authority to go to war, and recalled his troops.

Josephus implies that Vitellius was unwilling to cooperate with the tetrarch because of a grudge he bore from an earlier incident. According to his account, Antipas provided hospitality at a conference on the Euphrates between Vitellius and King Artabanus III of Parthia, and after Vitellius&#x27; diplomatic success anticipated the governor in sending a report to Tiberius. However, other sources place the meeting between Vitellius and Artabanus under Tiberius&#x27; successor Caligula, leading some historians to think that Josephus misdated it to the reign of Tiberius or conflated it with an earlier diplomatic meeting involving Antipas and Vitellius.

==Exile and death==
Antipas&#x27; fall from power was due to Caligula and to his own nephew Agrippa, brother of Herodias. When Agrippa fell into debt during the reign of Tiberius despite his connections with the imperial family, Herodias persuaded Antipas to provide for him, but the two men quarrelled, and Agrippa departed. After Agrippa was heard expressing to his friend Caligula his eagerness for Tiberius to die and leave room for Caligula to succeed him, he was imprisoned. When Caligula became emperor in 37, he released his friend and granted him rule of Philip&#x27;s former tetrarchy (slightly extended), with the title of king.

Josephus relates that Herodias, jealous at Agrippa&#x27;s success, persuaded Antipas to ask Caligula for the title of king for himself. However, Agrippa simultaneously presented the emperor with a list of charges against the tetrarch: allegedly, he had conspired against Tiberius with Sejanus (executed in 31) and was plotting against Caligula with King Artabanus. As evidence, Agrippa noted that Antipas had a stockpile of weapons sufficient for 70,000 men. Hearing Antipas&#x27; admission to this last charge, Caligula decided to believe the allegations of conspiracy. In the summer of 39, Antipas&#x27; money and territory were turned over to Agrippa, while Antipas was exiled. His place of exile is described by Josephus in &quot;Antiquities&quot; as Lugdunum, a city in Gaul, and as Hispania in &quot;The Wars of the Jews&quot;. There are two places in France that claim to be the place of exile: Lyon (Lugdunum) and Saint-Bertrand-de-Comminges (Lugdunum Convenae), on the Spanish border. Antipas died in exile. The 3rd-century historian Cassius Dio seems to imply that Caligula had him killed, but this is usually treated with skepticism by modern historians.

==Legacy==
Among the followers of Jesus and members of the early Christian movement mentioned in the New Testament are Joanna, the wife of one of Antipas&#x27; stewards, and Manaen, a &quot;foster-brother&quot; or &quot;companion&quot; of Antipas (both translations are possible for the Greek ). It has been conjectured that these were sources for early Christian knowledge of Antipas and his court. In any case, Antipas featured prominently in the New Testament in connection with the deaths of John the Baptist and Jesus. The pseudepigraphical &quot;Gospel of Peter&quot; further states that it was Antipas rather than Pilate who ordered the crucifixion of Jesus. In line with the work&#x27;s anti-Judaic theme, it pointedly remarks that Herod and &quot;the Jews&quot;, unlike Pilate, refused to &quot;wash their hands&quot; of responsibility for the death.

Antipas has appeared in a large number of representations of the passion of Jesus—most notably portrayed by Frank Thring in &quot;King of Kings&quot; (1961), José Ferrer in &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot; (1965), and Christopher Plummer in &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (1977). Often, as in the films &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; (2004), Antipas is portrayed as effeminate (Antipas is played in those films by Joshua Mostel and Luca De Dominicis respectively); the origin of this tradition may have been Antipas&#x27; manipulation by his wife Herodias, as well as Christ&#x27;s description of him as a &quot;fox&quot; in Luke 13:32, using a feminine word in the original Greek. In &quot;Salome&quot; (1953), he is portrayed by Charles Laughton. He was played by Mitchell Lewis in &quot;Salomé&quot; (1923). He also features in &quot;The Secret Magdalene&quot; by Ki Longfellow. In Longfellow&#x27;s view, he was not effeminate so much as rash, ineffective, and when backed into a corner by his furious ex-father-in-law, willing to do anything to save himself.

In Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s &quot;Hérodias&quot; (1877), Herodias uses her long-concealed daughter, Salome, to manipulate Herod sexually for her own political purposes. This conceit (original to Flaubert) inspired Oscar Wilde&#x27;s play &quot;Salome&quot; (1891), the first version of the legend to show Salome with a will of her own, opposing her mother and lusting after John the Baptist. Naive and puzzled by her stepfather&#x27;s lascivious attentions, the young girl arouses Herod in order to avenge herself on the prophet who has refused her advances. Flaubert&#x27;s novella was turned into an opera by Jules Massenet (&quot;Hérodiade&quot;, 1881) in which Salome, ignorant of her royal parentage, becomes a disciple of John, who is then executed by the lustful and jealous Herod (a baritone). In Richard Strauss&#x27;s operatic setting of Wilde&#x27;s play (1905), Herod (a tenor) is depicted as befuddled by both drink and lust, and in bitter conflict with his wife (as in Flaubert). At the end of the opera (as in Wilde&#x27;s play), disgusted with Salome&#x27;s behavior with the head of John, he orders her execution. In &quot;Journey to Bethlehem&quot;, he is portrayed as the semi-loyal son of Herod and struggles to follow his father&#x27;s commands.

<doc id="356717" wikidata="Q107280931" url="?curid=356717" title="Horror Business">
<text>&quot;Horror Business&quot; is the third single released by the American horror punk band Misfits. It was released on June 26, 1979 through vocalist Glenn Danzig&#x27;s own label, Plan 9 Records, and is commonly said to have been inspired by the unsolved murder of Nancy Spungen. The B-side of the single features the songs &quot;Teenagers from Mars&quot; and &quot;Children in Heat&quot;.

The single&#x27;s cover artwork features a skeletal figure inspired by the titular character from the 1946 film serial &quot;The Crimson Ghost&quot;. The figure became a mascot for the band, and its skull image would serve as the Misfits&#x27; logo for the rest of their career.

==Background and recording==
On October 12, 1978, the body of Nancy Spungen was discovered in the bathroom of her room at Hotel Chelsea in Manhattan, New York City. Spungen had been living at the hotel with her boyfriend, Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious. Her body was found with a fatal stab wound in her abdomen, and Vicious purportedly owned the knife that made the wound. Vicious was arrested and charged with second degree murder, and after pleading not guilty, he was released on bail, awaiting trial. On the evening of February 1, 1979, a small group of Vicious&#x27;s friends, including Misfits bassist Jerry Only, gathered to celebrate Vicious having made bail at his new girlfriend Michelle Robinson&#x27;s Greenwich Village apartment. Vicious had undergone a detoxification program during his time in jail at Rikers Island, but at the dinner gathering, Vicious had English photographer Peter &quot;Kodick&quot; Gravelle deliver him heroin. Vicious died of an overdose at some point during the night, and was discovered by his mother, Anne Beverley, and Robinson the following morning.

Prior to Vicious&#x27;s death, the Misfits were rumored to potentially back Vicious on his proposed debut solo album. After learning of his death, Only helped Beverley collect Vicious&#x27;s possessions, and invited her to attend a Misfits recording session. &quot;Horror Business&quot;, &quot;Teenagers from Mars&quot;, and &quot;Children in Heat&quot; were recorded from January 26 to February 5, 1979 at C.I. Studios in New York, where the band had recorded their proposed debut album &quot;Static Age&quot; a year prior. Beverley attended at least one of the sessions. Writer and vocalist Glenn Danzig insisted that the band record as many tracks as possible during their allotted time in the studio in an effort to save money.

The title track, &quot;Horror Business&quot;, contains lyrics such as &quot;You don&#x27;t go in the bathroom with me&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll put a knife right in you&quot;. Because of such lyrics, along with the connections between the Misfits and Vicious, the song is commonly said to have been based on the unsolved murder of Spungen. However, the song&#x27;s lyrics have also been noted as possible references to the 1960 film &quot;Psycho&quot;, which features a scene involving a character being stabbed to death in a bathroom. The line &quot;Psycho &#x27;78&quot;, which also appears in the song, has been interpreted as transposing the year in which the film was released (as well as when the film&#x27;s narrative takes place) to the year that the song was recorded. The line &quot;driving late at night&quot; may also be a reference to Psycho, in which Janet Leigh&#x27;s character spends a long portion of the film&#x27;s first act driving through the night before ultimately ending up at the Bates Motel.

==Release==
The songs &quot;Horror Business&quot; and &quot;Teenagers from Mars&quot; were considered for inclusion in a 1979 12&quot; record which would have also featured the song &quot;Who Killed Marilyn?&quot;. An acetate disc of this proposed release was pressed, but completing a run of 12&quot; records for the release was deemed to be too expensive, and so the release was scrapped.

The first pressing of the &quot;Horror Business&quot; single, issued by Danzig&#x27;s own label Plan 9 Records on June 26, 1979, consisted of 25 sleeveless black 7&quot; vinyl copies. The second pressing, from August 1979, consisted of 2,000 copies on yellow vinyl. Due to a pressing error, approximately 20 copies had the track &quot;Horror Business&quot; on both sides, rather than &quot;Horror Business&quot; on the A-side and &quot;Teenagers from Mars&quot; and &quot;Children in Heat&quot; on the B-side. Many copies contained an insert with a fabricated story claiming that the band had recorded the single in an abandoned haunted house in New Jersey, and that, when later mixing the tapes at a recording studio in New York City, they heard strange voices and noises in the background of the recordings. According to a 1993 interview with Jerry Only:
What happened was, there was a weird sound on there, and we didn&#x27;t know where the hell it came from. So we said, &quot;What are we gonna do? Are we gonna remix it?&quot; I said, &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t got no more money. This is it. You gotta like what you got.&quot; We thought about it, and we thought, we don&#x27;t want everybody to think we&#x27;re a bunch of jerks. So I think I mentioned it, &quot;Let&#x27;s just say it was recorded in a haunted house. Everybody&#x27;ll love that!&quot;

The songs &quot;Horror Business&quot;, &quot;Teenagers from Mars&quot;, and &quot;Children in Heat&quot; have been re-released multiple times since the single was first issued. In 1980, the songs were included on the Misfits&#x27; EP &quot;Beware&quot;. In 1986, &quot;Horror Business&quot; and &quot;Teenagers from Mars&quot; were included as tracks on the compilation album &quot;Misfits&quot;, also known as &quot;Collection I&quot;. A live version of &quot;Horror Business&quot; was included on the EP and album &quot;Evilive&quot;, released in 1982 and 1987, respectively. &quot;Children in Heat&quot; was re-issued in 1995 on the compilation album &quot;Collection II&quot;. These releases were all included in the 1996 boxed set &quot;The Misfits&quot;. &quot;Teenagers from Mars&quot; was also included on the album &quot;Static Age&quot;, which was part of the boxed set and which received a standalone release in 1997.
===Cover artwork===
The single&#x27;s cover artwork features an image of the eponymous character from the 1946 film serial &quot;The Crimson Ghost&quot;. The Misfits had first made use of the character&#x27;s likeness in a flyer promoting one of their gigs on March 28, 1979 at Max&#x27;s Kansas City, after Danzig and Only came across a picture of the Crimson Ghost while searching for images to silkscreen on T-shirts.

The &quot;Horror Business&quot; single marks the first time that the Misfits had incorporated the character&#x27;s likeness into the cover artwork of one of their releases, and the character&#x27;s skull-like visage would become a recognizable mascot and logo for the band throughout their career. The back cover of the single features black-and-white portraits of the individual band members, along with a rendering of Lon Chaney as the Phantom from the 1925 film &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;.

==Track listing==

==Critical reception==

In his book &quot;This Music Leaves Stains: The Complete Story of the Misfits&quot;, author James Greene Jr. writes of the single as a whole: &quot;While more muddled production-wise than &#x27;Bullet&#x27;, &#x27;Horror Business&#x27; is just as arresting as its predecessor [...] &#x27;Horror Business&#x27; was greeted by the growing Misfits fan base as an instant classic.&quot; He goes on to note that the title track &quot;offers a bluesy feel at times, almost as if nothing more is at stake than the melody.&quot;

Dan Ozzi of Diffuser.fm ranked &quot;Horror Business&quot; #7 on his list of the 10 best Misfits songs, and noted the &quot;vague&quot; nature of the track&#x27;s lyrics. Eduardo Rivadavia of Ultimate Classic Rock also ranked the song #7 on his list of the top 10 Misfits songs, comparing the track&#x27;s &quot;knuckle-scraping riffs&quot; and Danzig&#x27;s &quot;distinctively punchy pronunciation&quot; to the music of the Ramones. Aaron Lariviere of &quot;Stereogum&quot; ranked the track #9 on his list of the best Misfits songs, calling it an example of a Misfits song with lyrics that are &quot;just awesome&quot;.

<doc id="356718" wikidata="Q1648240" url="?curid=356718" title="Shock therapy (economics)">
<text>In economics, shock therapy is a group of policies intended to be implemented simultaneously in order to liberalize an economy, including liberalization of all prices, privatization, trade liberalization, and stabilization via tight monetary policies and fiscal policies. In the case of post-Communist states, it was implemented in order to transition from a planned economy to a market economy. More recently, it has been implemented in Argentina by the administration of Javier Milei.

==Overview==
Shock therapy is a program intended to economically liberalize a mixed economy or transition a planned economy or developmentalist economy to a free-market economy through sudden and dramatic neoliberal reform. Shock therapy policies generally include ending price controls, stopping government subsidies, privatizing state-owned industries, and tighter fiscal policies, such as higher tax rates and lowered government spending. In essence, shock therapy policies can be distilled to price liberalization accompanied by strict austerity.

The first instance of shock therapy was the neoliberal reforms of Chile under Pinochet, carried out after the military coup by Augusto Pinochet. The reforms were based on the liberal economic ideas centered on the University of Chicago, which became known as the Chicago Boys. The term is also applied to Bolivia&#x27;s case. Bolivia successfully tackled hyperinflation in 1985 under President Victor Paz Estenssoro and Minister of Planning Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada, using the ideas of economist Jeffrey Sachs.

Economic liberalism rose to prominence after the 1960s and liberal shock therapy became increasingly used as a response to economic crises, for example by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. Shock therapy has been controversial, with its proponents arguing that it helped to end economic crises, stabilized economies, and paved the way for economic growth, while its critics including economist Joseph Stiglitz believed that it helped deepen them unnecessarily and created unnecessary social suffering.

In post-Soviet Russia and other post-Communist states, neoliberal reforms based on the Washington Consensus resulted in a surge in excess mortality and decreasing life expectancy, along with rising economic inequality, corruption, and poverty. Isabella Weber of the University of Massachusetts said: &quot;As a result of shock therapy, Russia experienced a rise in mortality beyond that of any previous peacetime experiences of an industrialized country.&quot; The Gini ratio increased by an average of 9 points for all post-Communist states. The average post-Communist state had returned to 1989 levels of per-capita GDP by 2005, although some are still far behind that. In Russia, the average real income for 99 percent of people was lower in 2015 than in 1991. According to William Easterly, successful market economies rest on a framework of law, regulation, and established practice, which cannot be instantaneously created in a society that was formerly authoritarian, heavily centralised, and subject to state ownership of assets. 

German historian Philipp Ther asserted that the imposition of shock therapy had little to do with future economic growth. Notable proponent Jeffrey Sachs has stated that he believes shock therapy should be accompanied by debt forgiveness.

==History==
===West Germany, 1948===
====Background====
Germany ended the European Theatre of World War II with its unconditional surrender on the 8 May 1945. April 1945 to July 1947 saw the Allied occupation of Germany implement Joint Chiefs of Staff directive 1067 (JCS 1067). This directive aimed to transfer Germany&#x27;s economy from one centered on heavy industry to a pastoral one to prevent Germany from having the capacity for war. Civilian industries that might have military potential, which in the modern era of &quot;total war&quot; included virtually all, were severely restricted. The restriction of the latter was set to Germany&#x27;s &quot;approved peacetime needs&quot;, which were set on the average European standard. To achieve this, each type of industry was subsequently reviewed to see how many factories Germany required under these minimum level of industry requirements.

It soon became obvious that this policy was not sustainable. Germany could not grow enough food for itself, and malnutrition was becoming increasingly common. The European post-war economic recovery did not materialise and it became increasingly obvious that the European economy had depended on German industry. In July 1947, President Harry S. Truman rescinded on &quot;national security grounds&quot; the punitive JCS 1067, which had directed the U.S. forces of occupation in Germany to &quot;take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany.&quot; It was replaced by JCS 1779, which instead stressed that &quot;[a]n orderly, prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany.&quot;

By 1948, Germany suffered from rampant hyperinflation. The currency of the time (the Reichsmark) had no public confidence, and thanks to that and price controls, black market trading boomed and bartering proliferated. Banks were over their heads in debt and surplus currency abounded. Thanks to the introduction of JCS 1779 and the first Allied attempts to set up German governance, something could be done about this. Ludwig Erhard, an economist, who had spent much time working on the problem of post war recovery, had worked his way up the administration created by the occupying American forces until he became the Director of Economics in the Bizonal Economic Council in the joint British and American occupied zones (which later, with the addition of the French occupied territory, became the basis for West Germany).

====Economic reforms====
Currency reform took effect on June 20, 1948, through the introduction of the Deutsche Mark to replace the Reichsmark and by transferring to the Bank deutscher Länder the sole right to print money.

Under the German Currency Conversion Law on 27 June, private non-bank credit balances were converted at a rate of 10 RM to 1 DM, with half remaining in a frozen bank account. Although the money stock was very small in terms of national product, the adjustment in the price structure immediately led to sharp price increases, fueled by the high velocity of money through the system. As a result, on 4 October, the military governments wiped out 70% of the remaining frozen balances, resulting in an effective exchange of 10:0.65. Holders of financial assets (including many small-time savers) were dispossessed and the banks&#x27; debt in Reichsmarks was eliminated, transferred instead into claims on the Lander and later the Federal Government. Wages, rents, pensions and other recurring liabilities were transferred at 1:1. On the day of the currency reform, Ludwig Erhard announced, despite the reservations of the Allies, that rationing would be considerably relaxed and price controls abolished.

====Results====
In the short term, the currency reforms and abolition of price controls helped end hyperinflation. The new currency enjoyed considerable confidence and was accepted by the public as a medium of payment. The currency reforms had ensured that money was once scarcer, and the relaxation of price controls created incentives for production, sales and earning this money. The removal of price controls also meant shops filled up with goods again, which was a huge psychological factor in the adoption of the new currency.

As would later also occur in the post-Soviet states, shock therapy resulted in redistribution from the bottom-up, benefiting those who held non-monetary assets. Although Erhard&#x27;s price liberalization excluded rents and essential goods, it still caused an increase in inflation and resulted in a general strike. A turn from a free market to a social market economy followed under the Jedermann Programm, and by late 1948 &quot;the German transition followed a dual-track pattern with a planned core and a market-coordinated periphery.&quot;

===Chile, 1975===
====Economic reforms====
The government welcomed foreign investment and eliminated protectionist trade barriers, forcing Chilean businesses to compete with imports on an equal footing, or else go out of business. The main copper company, Codelco, remained in government hands due to the nationalization of copper completed by Salvador Allende but private companies were allowed to explore and develop new mines.

In the short term, the reforms stabilized the economy. In the long term, Chile has had higher GDP growth than its neighboring countries but with a noticeable increase of income inequality.

===Bolivia, 1985===
====Background====
Between 1979 and 1982, Bolivia was ruled by a series of coups, countercoups, and caretaker governments, including the notorious dictatorship of Luis García Meza Tejada. This period of political instability set the stage for the hyperinflation that later crippled the country. In October 1982, the military convened a Congress elected in 1980 to lead choose a new Chief Executive. The country elected Hernán Siles Zuazo, under whose term the galloping hyperinflationary process started. Zuazo received scant support from the political parties or members of congress, most of whom were eager to flex their newly acquired political muscles after so many years of authoritarianism. Zuazo refused to take extra-constitutional powers (as previous military governments had done in similar crises) and concentrated on preserving the democracy instead, shortening his term by one year in response to his unpopularity and the crisis racking his country. On 6 August 1985, President Víctor Paz Estenssoro was elected.

====Prelude to Decree 21060====
On 29 August, just three weeks after the election of Víctor Paz Estenssoro as President, and the appointment of Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada, the architect of shock therapy, as Planning Minister, Decree 21060 was passed. Decree 21060 covered all aspects of the Bolivian economy, later referred to as shock therapy. In the run-up to the decree, Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada recalled what the new government set out to do, saying: &quot;People felt you couldn&#x27;t stop hyperinflation in a democracy; that you had to have a military government, an authoritarian government to take all these tough steps that had to be taken. Bolivia was the first country to stop hyperinflation in a democracy without depriving people of their civil rights and without violating human rights.&quot;

About the three weeks between the inauguration of the President and decree 21060, he said: &quot;We spent one week saying, &#x27;Do we really need to do something? Do we really need radical change?&#x27; and then another week debating shock treatment versus gradualism. Finally, we took one week to write it all up.&quot; Once they had decided to act, de Lozada recalled of &quot;a big discussion whether you could stop hyperinflation or inflation, period, by taking gradual steps&quot;. He added: &quot;Many people said you had to take it slowly. You have to cure the patient. Shock treatment means you have a very sick patient [and] you have to operate before the patient dies. You have to get the cancer out, or you have to stop the infection.&quot; He explained: &quot;That&#x27;s why we coined the phrase that inflation is like a tiger and you have only one shot; if you don&#x27;t get it with that one shot, it&#x27;ll get you. You have a credibility that you have to achieve. If you keep to gradualism, people don&#x27;t believe you, and the hyperinflation just keeps roaring stronger. So shock therapy is get it over, get it done, stop hyperinflation, and then start rebuilding your economy so you achieve growth.&quot;

====Decree 21060====
Decree 21060 included the following measures:
* Allowing the peso to float.
* Ending price controls and eliminating subsidies to the public sector.
* Laying off two-thirds of the employees of the state oil and tin companies and freezing the pay of the remaining employees and public sector workers.
* Liberalising import tariffs by imposing a uniform 20% tariff.
* Stopping the payment of foreign debt under a deal negotiated with the IMF.

===Post-Soviet states===
With the exception of Belarus, the Eastern European states adopted shock therapy. Nearly all of these post-Soviet states suffered deep and prolonged recessions after shock therapy, with poverty increasing more than tenfold. The resulting crisis of the 1990s was twice as intense as the Great Depression in the countries of Western Europe and the United States in the 1930s. The hypothesized one time jump in prices intended as part of shock therapy actually led to a lengthy period of extremely high inflation with a drop in output and subsequent low growth rates. Shock therapy devalued the modest wealth accumulated by individuals under socialism and amounted to a regressive redistribution of wealth in favor of elites who held non-monetary assets. Contrary to the expectation of shock therapy proponents, Russia&#x27;s rapid transition to the market increased corruption, rather than alleviating it.

The cost to human life was profound, as Russia suffered the worst peace time increase in mortality experienced by any industrialized country. For the years 1987 and 1988, roughly 2% of Russia population lived in poverty (surviving on less than $4 a day), by 1993-1995, it was 50%. According to Kristen Ghodsee and Mitchell A. Orenstein, a significant body of scholarship demonstrates that the rapid privatization schemes associated with neoliberal economic reforms did result in poorer health outcomes in former Eastern Bloc countries during the transition to capitalism, with the World Health Organization itself stating &quot;IMF economic reform programs are associated with significantly worsened tuberculosis incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates in post-communist Eastern European and former Soviet countries.&quot; They add that Western institutions and economists were indifferent to the consequences of the shock therapy they were advocating as their priorities included permanently dismantling the state socialist system and integrating these countries into the emerging global capitalist economy, and that many citizens of the former Eastern Bloc countries came to believe that Western powers were deliberately inflicting this suffering upon them as punishment for defying Western ideals about liberal democracy and market economics.

Arguments exist whether these adverse outcomes were due to the general collapse of the Soviet economy (which began before 1989) or the policies subsequently implemented or a combination of both. Sachs himself resigned from his post as advisor, after stating that he felt his advice was unheeded and his policy recommendations were not actually put into practice. In addition to his criticism of the way in which Russian authorities handled the reforms, Sachs has also criticized the U.S. and the IMF for not providing large-scale financial aid to Russia, which he felt was integral to the success of the reforms.

Advocates of shock therapy view Poland as the success story of shock therapy in the post-communist states and claim that shock therapy was not applied appropriately in Russia, while critics claim that Poland&#x27;s reforms were the most gradualist of all the countries and contrast China&#x27;s reforms with those of Russia and their vastly different effects. Some research suggests that the very fast pace of &#x27;shock therapy&#x27; privatization mattered and had a particularly harsh effect on the death rate in Russia.

====Background in Poland====

After the failure of the Communist government in the elections of June 4, 1989, it became clear that the previous regime was no longer legitimate. The unofficial talks at Magdalenka and then the Polish Round Table talks of 1989 allowed for a peaceful transition of power to the democratically elected government.

The economic situation was that inflation was high, peaking at around 600%, and the majority of state-owned monopolies and holdings were largely ineffective and completely obsolete in terms of technology. Although there was practically no unemployment in Poland, wages were low and the shortage economy led to a lack of even the most basic foodstuffs in the shops. Unlike the other post-communist countries, however, Poland did have some experience with a capitalist economy, as there was still private property in agriculture and food was still sold in farmers&#x27; markets.

In September 1989 a commission of experts was formed under the presidency of Leszek Balcerowicz, Poland&#x27;s leading economist, Minister of Finance and deputy Premier of Poland. Among the members of the commission were Jeffrey Sachs, Stanisław Gomułka, Stefan Kawalec and Wojciech Misiąg.

====Balcerowicz Plan====

On October 6 the program was presented on public television and in December the Sejm passed a packet of 11 acts, all of which were signed by the president on December 31, 1989. These were:

# &quot;Act on Financial Economy Within State-owned Companies&quot;, which allowed for state-owned businesses to declare bankruptcy and ended the fiction by which companies were able to exist even if their effectiveness and accountability was close to none.
# &quot;Act on Banking Law&quot;, which forbade financing the state budget deficit by the national central bank and forbade the issue of new currency.
# &quot;Act on Credits&quot;, which abolished the preferential laws on credits for state-owned companies and tied interest rates to inflation.
# &quot;Act on Taxation of Excessive Wage Rise&quot;, introducing the so-called popiwek tax limiting the wage increase in state-owned companies in order to limit hyperinflation.
# &quot;Act on New Rules of Taxation&quot;, introducing common taxation for all companies and abolishing special taxes that could previously have been applied to private companies through means of administrative decision.
# &quot;Act on Economic Activity of Foreign Investors&quot;, allowing foreign companies and private people to invest in Poland and export their profits abroad.
# &quot;Act on Foreign Currencies&quot;, introducing internal exchangeability of the zloty and abolishing the state monopoly in international trade.
# &quot;Act on Customs Law&quot;, creating a uniform customs rate for all companies.
# &quot;Act on Employment&quot;, regulating the duties of unemployment agencies.
# &quot;Act on Special Circumstances Under Which a Worker Could be Laid Off&quot;, protecting the workers of state firms from being fired in large numbers and guaranteeing unemployment grants and severance pay.

Privatization of companies was left until later.

====Results in Poland====

In the short term, the reforms smothered the building hyperinflation before it reached high levels, ended food shortages, restored goods on the shelves of shops and halved the absence of employees in the work place. However, the reforms also caused many state companies to close at once, leaving their workers unemployed, and government statistics show this change as unemployment rose from 0.3% in January 1990 (just after the reforms) to 6.5% by the end of that year, and a shrinking in the GDP for the next two consecutive years by 9.78% in the first and 7.02% (see main article).

In the long term, the reforms paved the way for economic recovery, with the GDP growing steadily to about 6–7% between 1995–7, falling to a low of 1.2% in 2001 before rising back up to the 6–7% region by 2007, often led by small service businesses, long suppressed by the Communist government. However, despite GDP indicating prosperity for Poland, the unemployment rate continued to rise steadily, peaking at 16.9% in July 1994 before steadily falling down to a low of 9.5% in August 1998 before rising once more to a high of 20.7% in February 2003, from which it had fallen until the year 2008. During the early years, the unemployment rate is thought to have been lower due to many of those claiming unemployment working in the grey (informal) economy, although this can account for no more than 5% of the unemployment rate.

Ownership of consumables (cars, TVs, VCRs, washing machines, refrigerators, personal computers, etc.) boomed, as did consumption of fruit and vegetables, meat and fish. However, the huge economic adjustment Poland underwent created massive anxiety.

As of 2008, the GNP was 77% higher than in 1989. Moreover, inequality in Poland actually decreased right after the economic reforms were implemented, although it rose back up again in later years. Today, although Poland is confronted with a variety of economic problems, it still has a higher GDP than during communist times, and a gradually developing economy. Poland was converging towards the EU in regards to income level in 1993–2004. According to Financial Times, Poland&#x27;s shock therapy paved the way for entrepreneurs and helped to build an economy that was less vulnerable to external shock than Poland’s neighbours. In 2009, while the rest of Europe was in recession, Poland continued to grow, without a single quarter of negative growth.

====Results in Russia====
Due to rampant hyperinflation, famine, poverty, and the depression of 1990-1991 in the Soviet Union, Russian leaders attempted to implement shock therapy to the economy. This was not well-received by the Russian public, as it worsened issues and contributed to the rise of Russian oligarchs. The downfall of shock therapy in Russia was marked by widespread social dislocation, economic instability, and the rise of oligarchs, contributing to public criticism and eroding trust in the government&#x27;s neoliberal reform agenda. It also contributed to the support for the rise of Vladimir Putin and his brand of authoritarianism. 

=== Peru, 1990 ===
=== India, 1991 ===
===Iraq, 2003===

===Argentina, 2024===
Argentina&#x27;s economy has always been unpredictable. Once hailed as one of the richest nations per capita in 1913, it quickly deteriorated by the 1930s when a military junta seized power. Argentina’s immense periods of growth were frequently undone by the consequences of its own policies. There is an old saying among economists: “Throughout history there have been only four kinds of economies in the world: advanced, developing, Japan, and Argentina.&quot;

==== Background ====

Starting in 2019, Argentina introduced exchange controls to curb increasing inflation. In June 2020, the Peronist government introduced strict rent controls. Although this suppressed prices in the short term, rents surged only 2 years later as the supply of rental housing faltered. By September 2023 the supply of rental homes had reduced by 80% when compared to 2015. In 2021, the government implemented capital controls and tightened the currency, leading to two diverging exchange rates: the official and the parallel exchange rate. The official exchange rate is a government-controlled rate often used in statistics (like poverty statistics) and formal transactions like trade and official economic measures, while the parallel exchange rate reflects the true supply-and-demand-driven market value of the currency, often significantly differing due to government restrictions or economic instability. By 2022, inflation had risen from 2.4% per month to a peak of 25% per month in December 2023, propelling the nation into hyperinflation. Over the last 123 years, Argentina has recorded a budget deficit in 113 of them. Lucas Romero, the head of Synopsis, a local political consulting firm and Andrei Roman, CEO of Brazil-based pollster Atlas Intel believe that Javier Milei’s victory in the 2023 elections was not only a result of popular approval of his ideas but rather stemmed from widespread dissatisfaction with the political establishment, which had been strongly left-wing in its economic approach. The people thus wanted change.

====Milei&#x27;s decisions====

After taking office, Milei enacted drastic measures, including severe budget cuts, downsizing the government by firing 24,000 federal employees, and setting a goal to cut 50,000 more. Milei also devalued the official currency by 50% to reduce the gap between the official and parallel exchange rates, continuing with a policy of monthly devaluations of 2% until the gap is closed. Seeking to make the market freer, Milei vowed to dismantle existing capital controls and regulations, as well as eliminate 90% of current taxes (not a 90% reduction in tax rates).

In October 2024, Milei announced the shutting down of &#x27;Administración Federal de Ingresos Públicos&#x27; (AFIP), the Argentine tax agency. According to Bloomberg Línea, 80 percent of AFIP&#x27;s 2024 budget was allocated for salary payments. With the restructuring, a significant reduction in staff is anticipated, including the termination of over 3,000 AFIP agents who were &quot;irregularly hired&quot; by the previous administration. The changes will also slash &quot;higher-level positions by 45 percent and lower-level positions by 30 percent,&quot; reducing senior officials&#x27; salaries. Overall, the measures are expected to &quot;result in budgetary savings of around [6.4 million dollars] per year,&quot; the statement added. &quot;Reason&quot; magazine says, &quot;It will be replaced by a newly formed agency, the Agencia de Recaudación y Control Aduanero (ARCA), which will assume some of its functions&quot;.

==== Consequences ==== 
In the first months of Milei&#x27;s administration, the poverty rate spiked from 41.7% in late 2023 to 52.9% in early 2024, although poverty had already been increasing substantially before he took office, so to what extent Milei is to blame and to what extent the previous administration is to blame became a subject of debate. By the third quarter of 2024, the poverty rate declined to 38.9%. This figure has been calculated by the Argentine government agency, the National Institute of Statistics and Census of Argentina (INDEC). They have international oversight from the IMF, lending credibility towards the calculation. The Torcuato Di Tella University estimates the poverty rate to be 36.8%, which changed to 33.5% by the end of January 2025. Meanwhile the ODSA (Observatorio de la Deuda Social Argentina) poverty watchdog of the UCA Catholic University voiced that although the projected indices had reached similar levels to the previous year for the third quarter of 2024 (41.7%), the consumer capacity of households experienced a reduction due to higher costs of basic services such as electricity, water, gas and transport, among others. Poverty is expected to reduce by INDEC as the country stabilizes. By repealing rent controls, the rental housing supply shot up by 170% as real rent prices decreased by 40% (adjusted for inflation). Milei’s downsizing of the government resulted in Argentina&#x27;s government spending being reduced by 30%, achieving its first budget surplus in 12 years. By November 2024, inflation returned to 2.4% per month. Factoring in the 2% intended monthly devaluation, the underlying monthly inflation rate was only 0.4%.

A December 2024 Gallup poll showed improved public perception: 53% of Argentinians believed their standard of living was improving, reaching levels not seen since 2015, and 41% believed the economy of their city was improving.

JP Morgan revised its GDP growth projections for Argentina from 2% to 8.5%, reflecting optimism about the economic trajectory under Milei’s reforms. His policies have also improved Argentina&#x27;s standing with the IMF, raising hopes for further assistance. In the first and second quarter of 2024, Argentina&#x27;s GDP contracted by 2.1% and 1.8%. However, in the last quarter, it expanded 3.9% despite the significant austerity Implemented by the president. Conversely, agriculture rebounded dramatically from a severe drought, achieving an impressive growth rate of 80.2% as conditions improved. The economy of Argentina is projected to grow by 5.5% in 2025 by the BBVA, and 3.5% by Goldman Sach&#x27;s as inflation stabilizes and investment starts pouring in due to the Milei&#x27;s liberalisation of the economy. The financial improvements seen in the 3rd quarter of 2024 are complemented by society’s renewed confidence in the government, creating a positive outlook for 2025. 

In 2024, the Argentinian Peso appreciated by 44.2% against the dollar, outperforming all other currencies. In contrast, the second best performing currency against the dollar is the Lira, which gained 21.2%, less than half of the Peso&#x27;s increase. These steps were taken to steady an economy close to hyperinflation. With the peso gaining strength, average wages in dollars doubled to $990. In 2024, wages in Argentina rose by 145.5%, outpacing the 117.8% inflation rate, according to INDEC. According to Nowcast, the year-over-year increase in total family income (ITF) reached 185.7%. However, wage growth varied by sector. Formal private sector salaries increased by 147.5%, slightly above inflation, while public sector wages rose by only 119.3%. The biggest jump was in the informal sector, where incomes surged 196.7%. Despite wage increases, real income recovery has been uneven. In October 2024, CEPA reported that private sector wages had nearly returned to November 2023 levels. However, public sector incomes remained 14.8% lower, and informal workers were still down 21.3%.

Argentina’s Vaca Muerta shale formation is driving a major energy boom, making the country a net energy exporter for the first time in 14 years. With the world’s fourth-largest shale oil reserves and second largest shale gas deposits, Argentina is set to overtake Colombia as South America’s third-largest crude producer in 2025. Estimates suggest that Argentina&#x27;s production in 2030 will scale to 1 million barrels per day as Milei&#x27;s increases efforts in the extraction of oil and gas and reduces the existing capital controls, export taxes and regulations.

==Theory==

=== Origins of the term &quot;shock therapy&quot; ===
The term was popularized by Naomi Klein. In her 2007 book &quot;The Shock Doctrine&quot;, she argues that neoliberal free market policies (as advocated by the economist Milton Friedman) have risen to prominence globally because of a strategy of &quot;shock therapy&quot;. She argues these policies are often unpopular, result in greater inequality and are accompanied by political and social &quot;shocks&quot; such as military coups, state sponsored terror, sudden unemployment and the suppression of labor.

The economist Jeffrey Sachs (sometimes credited with coining the term) says he never picked the term &quot;shock therapy&quot;, does not much like it, and asserts that the term &quot;was something that was overlaid by journalism and public discussion&quot; and that the term &quot;sounds a lot more painful in a way than what it is&quot;. Sachs&#x27; ideas on what has been referred by non-economists as &quot;shock therapy&quot; were based on studying historic periods of monetary and economic crisis and noting that a decisive stroke could end monetary chaos, often in a day.

=== Pace of privatization ===
Shock therapy proponents Sachs and Lipton argued in 1990: &quot;The great conundrum is how to privatize a vast array of firms in a manner that is equitable, swift, politically viable, and likely to create an effective structure of corporate control.&quot; They recommended that the pace &quot;must be rapid, but not reckless&quot;, and should &quot;probably be carried out by many means&quot;. In the view of shock therapy proponents, trade liberalization requires domestic price liberalization first; thus a &quot;big bang&quot; in price liberalization underlying both privatization and trade liberalization forms the &quot;shock&quot; in the moniker &quot;shock therapy&quot;.

In practice, the rapid application of shock therapy proved generally disastrous in the post-Soviet states.

=== Departure from &quot;the invisible hand&quot; ===
Although economists have sometimes referred to shock therapy &quot;creating&quot; markets, Isabella Weber contends that shock therapy does not in fact create such new structures or institutions. She writes that the hope among shock therapy proponents is instead that the destruction of a command or planned economy would automatically result in a market economy and that expectation was that after the command economy or planned economy was &quot;shocked to death&quot;, the &quot;invisible hand&quot; might emerge.

According to Weber, expectations that a market economy would emerge following the imposition of shock therapy differ from Adam Smith&#x27;s original metaphor of the &quot;invisible hand&quot; and interprets Smith as thinking that the market as emerging slowly as the institutions that facilitate market exchange develop, and with the &quot;invisible hand&quot; the price mechanism could emerge.

=== Illusionary shock ===
Illusion therapy refers to the imposition of shock economic policies on economy in a way that the society doesn&#x27;t feel the shock or assumes that the dramatic change in policies is not as shocking or radical as it is in the real world. The first experience of illusion therapy has been documented after the implementation of Iran&#x27;s subsidy reform project.

<text>Campbeltown Airport () is located at Machrihanish, west of Campbeltown, near the tip of the Kintyre peninsula in Argyll and Bute on the west coast of Scotland.

The airport was formerly known as RAF Machrihanish (after the village of Machrihanish) and hosted squadrons of the Royal Air Force and other NATO air forces as well as the United States Marine Corps. The airport is at a strategic point near the Irish Sea, and was used to guard the entrance to the Firth of Clyde where US nuclear submarines were based at Holy Loch and where Royal Navy Trident missile submarines are still based at HMNB Clyde (Faslane Naval Base).

The United States Navy handed the airfield back to the MoD on 30 June 1995, marking the end of its service as a NATO facility since 1960. The airbase was sold to Machrihanish Airbase Community Company (MACC) in May 2012, and two thirds of the runway is leased to Highlands and Islands Airports for Campbeltown Airport.

At , the original runway 11/29 at Campbeltown Airport is the longest of any public airport in Scotland. It was built between 1960 and 1962 as part of a major reconstruction for the airport&#x27;s role in NATO.

Campbeltown Aerodrome has a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P808) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee (Highlands &amp; Islands Airports Limited)

Since 2017, passengers departing from Campbeltown, as well as Barra and Tiree, have not been subject to security checks, instead declaring that they do not have any prohibited items. Upon arrival at Glasgow, passengers connecting to other flights must go through security there.

==Airlines and destinations==
The following airlines operate regular scheduled flights to and from Campbeltown:
==Statistics==
==Incidents and accidents==
*On 15 March 2005, a Loganair aircraft crashed into the sea from the Campbeltown Airport, while operating as an air ambulance, killing both occupants, the pilot and the paramedic. The aircraft, a Britten-Norman Islander, was flying an instrument approach into Campbeltown in low clouds. The air ambulance had been sent to Campbeltown to transport a patient to Glasgow for surgery.

<text>Corticotropin-releasing factor family, CRF family is a family of related neuropeptides in vertebrates. This family includes corticotropin-releasing hormone (also known as CRF), urotensin-I, urocortin, and sauvagine. The family can be grouped into 2 separate paralogous lineages, with urotensin-I, urocortin and sauvagine in one group and CRH forming the other group. Urocortin and sauvagine appear to represent orthologues of fish urotensin-I in mammals and amphibians, respectively. The peptides have a variety of physiological effects on stress and anxiety, vasoregulation, thermoregulation, growth and metabolism, metamorphosis and reproduction in various species, and are all released as prohormones.

Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is a releasing hormone found mainly in the paraventricular nucleus of the mammalian hypothalamus that regulates the release of corticotropin (ACTH) from the pituitary gland. The paraventricular nucleus transports CRH to the anterior pituitary, stimulating adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release via CRH type 1 receptors, thereby activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) and, thus, glucocorticoid release.

CRH is evolutionary-related to a number of other active peptides. Urocortin acts &quot;in vitro&quot; to stimulate the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone. Urotensin is found in the teleost caudal neurosecretory system and may play a role in osmoregulation and as a corticotropin-releasing factor. Urotensin-I is released from the urophysis of fish, and produces ACTH and subsequent cortisol release in vivo. The nonhormonal portion of the prohormone is thought to be the urotensin binding protein (). Sauvagine, isolated from frog skin, has a potent hypotensive and antidiuretic effect.

<text>The Royal Military Academy (RMA) at Woolwich, in south-east London, was a British Army military academy for the training of commissioned officers of the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers. It later also trained officers of the Royal Corps of Signals and other technical corps. RMA Woolwich was commonly known as &quot;The Shop&quot; because its first building was a converted workshop of the Woolwich Arsenal.

==History==
===Origins in the Royal Arsenal===

An attempt had been made by the Board of Ordnance in 1720 to set up an academy within its Arsenal (then known as the Warren) to provide training and education for prospective officers of its new Regiment of Artillery and Corps of Engineers (both of which had been established there in 1716). A new building was being constructed in readiness for the Academy and funds had been secured, seemingly, through investment in the South Sea Company; but the latter&#x27;s collapse led to plans for the Academy being placed on hold.

After this false start, the academy was opened by authority of a Royal Warrant in 1741: it was intended, in the words of its first charter, to produce &quot;good officers of Artillery and perfect Engineers&quot;. Its &#x27;gentlemen cadets&#x27; initially ranged in age from 10 to 30. To begin with they were attached to the marching companies of the Royal Artillery, but in 1744 they were formed into their own company, forty in number (enlarged to forty-eight, two years later) overseen by a captain-lieutenant. To begin with the cadets were accommodated in lodgings in the town of Woolwich, but this arrangement was deemed unsatisfactory (the cadets gained a reputation for riotousness) so in 1751 a Cadets&#x27; Barracks was built just within the south boundary wall of the Warren and the cadets had to adjust to a more strict military discipline. (The Cadets&#x27; Barracks was demolished in the 1980s for road widening.)

Education in the academy focused at first on mathematics and the scientific principles of gunnery and fortification; French was also taught, for a small fee. In addition to their theoretical studies, the cadets shared (with all ranks of the Artillery) in what was called &#x27;the Practice&#x27; of gunnery, bridge building, magazine technique and artillery work. While an artillery officer attended each class to keep order, teaching in the academy was provided by civilians: a First Master (later called Professor of Fortification and Gunnery), a Second Master (later Professor of Mathematics) and additional tutors in French, Arithmetic, Classics and Drawing. In 1764 the Royal Academy (as it had been known) had the word &#x27;Military&#x27; added to its title, and at the same time a senior officer was appointed to serve as Lieutenant-Governor (&quot;de facto&quot; head of the institution). Moreover, the institution was split: younger cadets entered the Lower Academy, where they were taught reading, writing, arithmetic, Latin, French and drawing. If they performed well in examinations they were allowed to proceed to the Upper Academy, where they learned military skills and sciences (as well as fencing and dancing – required skills for prospective officers).

===Relocation to Woolwich Common===
The possibility of moving the Royal Military Academy out of the Warren was mooted as early as 1783, as it was fast outgrowing the available accommodation. At first costs precluded this possibility, but (with the Academy continuing to grow) James Wyatt, the Board of Ordnance Architect, was commissioned to design a new complex of buildings to stand, on a site facing the Royal Artillery Barracks, at the southern edge of Woolwich Common; it was built between 1796 and 1805 and opened for use the following year.
Wyatt&#x27;s Academy was built of yellow brick in the Tudor Gothic style. It consisted of a central block (reminiscent of the Ordnance Board&#x27;s headquarters in the Tower of London) flanked by a pair of accommodation blocks, linked by arcaded walkways. The central block contained classrooms, a library and offices; the accommodation blocks housed officers in the three-storey central sections and cadets in the two-storey wings. Behind the central block Wyatt placed a large dining hall flanked by spacious quadrangles having service buildings around the sides.

128 cadets moved to the new Academy: these comprised the four senior years. Of the younger cadets, sixty were kept at the Warren (by then renamed the Royal Arsenal) and another sixty were sent to a new college for junior cadets at Great Marlow. Practical teaching continued to be given in the working context of the Arsenal. In 1810, military cadets of the East India Company, who had previously been educated at the Academy, were moved to a new college at Addiscombe.

During the years that followed the status of the cadets changed: rather than being considered (albeit junior) military personnel, as had previously been the case, they were removed from the muster roll and they (or their parents) began to be charged fees for attendance. In this way the Academy took on something of the ethos of an English public school. In 1844 the Academy was described by Edward Mogg as accommodating:

Following the demise of the Board of Ordnance in the wake of the Crimean War the Academy was inspected by a commission which recommended changes: the minimum age for cadets was raised to fifteen and more specialist training was added. As part of these reforms the Academy complex was enlarged in the 1860s, with a view to accommodating all cadets on the same site (although some would remain in the Arsenal through to the 1880s): the frontage was extended with the addition of new pavilions at either end, in similar style to Wyatt&#x27;s work but in red brick rather than yellow; William Jervois was the architect. These contained new classrooms, with accommodation provided in similar new blocks behind. Sports facilities were also added along with gun batteries for training. In 1873 Wyatt&#x27;s central block had to be entirely rebuilt following a devastating fire. A new chiming clock was provided at this time by Gillett &amp; Bland of Croydon; the movement and bells were placed in the north-east turret and connected by rods to the dial on the parapet.

===Closure and aftermath===

Following the demise of the Board of Ordnance, Parliament had explored the possibility of a merger between the Royal Military Academy and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst (which only trained officers for the Infantry and Cavalry); although senior Army officers rejected the idea at the time it persisted into the twentieth century. Arguments in favour of a merger gained momentum in the 1920s when the specialist and scientific training which had been Woolwich&#x27;s preserve began to be outsourced to other locations. In 1936 it was decided that the merger should take place; but the Second World War intervened and in 1939 both institutions closed as their cadets were called up for active service.

The Royal Military Academy Woolwich closed in 1939 and in 1947 the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst was formed on the site of the former Royal Military College with the objective of providing officer training for all arms and services.
Thereafter, the old Academy site became part of Woolwich Garrison, housing troops of various types in the years that followed. The central block was taken over by the Royal Artillery Institution and housed a museum, archives and offices. The chapel (commissioned in 1902 by Commandant Richard Henry Jelf, commemorated by a brass plaque in the chapel) became the Garrison Church (replacing the bombed out Garrison Church of St George). In this way the old Academy continued in military use through the 20th century, but with the number of personnel based in Woolwich having steadily decreased, the site was in 2002 declared surplus to requirements. It closed the following year; two stained glass windows from the chapel – one by Christopher Whall, an Arts &amp; Crafts artist – were moved to the Garrison Church of St Alban the Martyr at Larkhill, where they are displayed in lightboxes.

====Sale and redevelopment====
Durkan Group bought the Woolwich site by public tender in 2006 and redevelopment started in 2008. The Woolwich buildings, several of which are grade II listed, were converted and extended into 334 houses and apartments, including 150 for a housing association. In 2017 the scaffolding around the main facade was removed as refurbishment neared completion. Since 2013 the RMA cricket field, one of the oldest in the UK, has been used by the 3rd and 4th teams of Blackheath Cricket Club.

==Legacy==
===Education and training===
Until 1870 prospective officers in the British Army had for the most part to purchase their commissions, and education or training was not seen as a requirement for the rôle. The Board of Ordnance&#x27;s establishment of a Military Academy represented a very different approach, whereby training and education were obligatory for aspiring officers of its corps, and promotion was offered according to merit (those with highest achievement in their exams being given the first choice of opportunities).

===Architecture===
The main Academy buildings are described by Historic England as &quot;an outstanding example of Wyatt&#x27;s Gothick style, and one of the most important pieces of military architecture in the country&quot;.

===Slang===
A phrase said to have entered common parlance from the Academy is &quot;talking shop&quot; (meaning &quot;to discuss subjects not understood by others&quot;).

The name of the cue game &quot;snooker&quot; (reputedly invented by a former cadet of the Academy) is said to derive from a slang term for newly arrived cadets: the French term &quot;les neux&quot;, which was later corrupted into &quot;snooks&quot;.

<doc id="356740" wikidata="Q171809" url="?curid=356740" title="Counties of England">
<text>The counties of England are a type of subdivision of England. Counties have been used as administrative areas in England since Anglo-Saxon times. There are three definitions of county in England: the 48 ceremonial counties used for the purposes of lieutenancy; the 84 metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties for local government; and the 39 historic counties.

The historic counties of England were mostly formed as shires or divisions of the earlier kingdoms, which gradually united by the 10th century to become England. The counties were initially used primarily for the administration of justice, overseen by a sheriff. They subsequently gained other roles, notably serving as constituencies and as areas for organising the militia, which was the responsibility of the lord-lieutenant. The county magistrates also gradually took on some administrative functions.

Administrative counties with elected county councils were created in 1889, taking over the administrative functions of the magistrates. The functions and territories of the counties have evolved since then, with significant amendments on several occasions, notably in 1889, 1965 and 1974.

Following the 1974 reforms, England (outside Greater London and the Isles of Scilly) had a two-tier structure of upper-tier county councils and lower-tier district councils, with each county being designated as either a metropolitan county or a non-metropolitan county. From 1995 onwards numerous unitary authorities have been established in the non-metropolitan counties, usually by creating a non-metropolitan county containing a single district and having one council perform both county and district functions. Since 1996 there have been two legal definitions of county: the counties as defined in local government legislation, and the counties for the purposes of lieutenancy (the latter being informally known as ceremonial counties).

The local government counties today cover England except for Greater London and the Isles of Scilly. There are six metropolitan counties and 78 non-metropolitan counties. Of the non-metropolitan counties, 21 are governed in a two-tier arrangement with an upper-tier county council and a number of lower-tier district councils, 56 are governed by a unitary authority performing both county and district functions, and one (Berkshire) is governed by six unitary authorities whilst remaining legally one county.

For the purposes of lieutenancy England (including Greater London and the Isles of Scilly) is divided into 48 counties, which are defined as groups of one or more local government counties.

Counties are also frequently used for non-administrative purposes, including culture, tourism and sport, with many organisations, clubs and leagues being organised on a county basis. For the purpose of sorting and delivering mail, England was divided into postal counties until 1996; they were then abandoned by Royal Mail in favour of postcodes.

==History==

===Origins===

Most of the historic English counties were established between the 7th and 11th centuries. Counties were initially used for the administration of justice and organisation of the militia, all overseen by a sheriff. The sheriff was usually appointed by the monarch but in some cases, known as the counties palatine, the right to appoint sheriffs rested elsewhere; for example with the Bishop of Durham for County Durham, and with the Earl of Chester for Cheshire.

A county&#x27;s magistrates sat four times a year as the quarter sessions. For more serious cases judges visited each county twice a year for the assizes. In some larger counties the practice arose of holding the quarter sessions separately for subdivisions of the county, including the Ridings of Yorkshire, the Parts of Lincolnshire and the Eastern and Western divisions of Sussex. The quarter sessions were also gradually given various civil functions, such as providing asylums, maintaining main roads and bridges, and the regulation of alehouses.

When parliaments began to be called from the 13th century onwards, the counties formed part of the system for electing members of parliament. Certain towns and cities were parliamentary boroughs sending their own representatives, and the remainder of each county served as a county constituency, with the MPs for such constituencies being known as knights of the shire.

From Tudor times onwards a lord-lieutenant was appointed to oversee the militia, taking some of the functions previously held by the sheriff. Some larger towns and cities were made self-governing counties corporate, starting with London in , with the right to hold their own courts and appoint their own sheriffs. The counties corporate continued to be deemed part of the wider county for the purposes of lieutenancy, with the exception of London which had its own lieutenants. The Ridings of Yorkshire had their own lieutenants from 1660 onwards. Sometimes smaller counties shared either a sheriff or lieutenant; the same person was usually appointed to be lieutenant of both Cumberland and Westmorland until 1876, whilst Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire shared a sheriff until 1965.

The counties&#x27; role as constituencies effectively ceased following the Reform Act 1832 and the associated Parliamentary Boundaries Act 1832. Most counties were divided into smaller constituencies, with the group of constituencies within each county being termed the &#x27;parliamentary county&#x27;.

County boundaries were sometimes adjusted, for example by some of the Inclosure Acts of the 18th and 19th centuries. County and other boundaries were not centrally recorded with any accuracy before the 19th century, but were instead known by local knowledge and custom. When the Ordnance Survey started producing large scale maps, they had to undertake extensive research with locals to establish where exactly the boundaries were. Boundaries were recorded by the Ordnance Survey gradually in a process which started in 1841 and was not fully completed until 1888. Many counties had detached exclaves, away from the main body of the county. Most exclaves were eliminated by boundary adjustments under the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844.

The Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 created poor law unions, which were defined as groups of parishes and frequently crossed county boundaries. Parishes were typically assigned to a union centred on a nearby town, whether or not that town was in the same county. The unions were administered by elected boards of guardians, and formed the basis for the registration districts created in 1837. Each union as a whole was assigned to a registration county, which therefore differed in places from the legal counties. The registration counties were used for census reporting from 1851 to 1911. The unions also formed the basis for the sanitary districts created in 1872, which took on various local government functions.

The county of Westmorland was formed in 1227. From then until 1889 there were generally agreed to be 39 counties in England, although there were some liberties such as the Liberty of Ripon which were independent from their host counties for judicial purposes. The Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 formally absorbed Wales into the kingdom of England and completed its division into 13 counties on the English model. Contemporary lists after that sometimes included Monmouthshire as a 40th English county, on account of its assizes being included in the Oxford circuit rather than one of the Welsh circuits. The 39 historic counties were:

*Bedfordshire
*Berkshire
*Buckinghamshire
*Cambridgeshire
*Cheshire
*Cornwall
*Cumberland
*Derbyshire
*Devon
*Dorset
*Durham
*Essex
*Gloucestershire
*Hampshire
*Herefordshire
*Hertfordshire
*Huntingdonshire
*Kent
*Lancashire
*Leicestershire
*Lincolnshire
*Middlesex
*Norfolk
*Northamptonshire
*Northumberland
*Nottinghamshire
*Oxfordshire
*Rutland
*Shropshire
*Somerset
*Staffordshire
*Suffolk
*Surrey
*Sussex
*Warwickshire
*Westmorland
*Wiltshire
*Worcestershire
*Yorkshire
===Creation of county councils===
By the late 19th century, there was increasing pressure to reform the structure of English counties; borough councils and boards of guardians were elected, but there were no elections for county-level authorities. Some urban areas had also grown across county boundaries, creating problems in how they were administered. The Local Government Act 1888 sought to address these issues. It established elected county councils, which came into being in 1889 and took over the administrative functions of the quarter sessions.

Some towns and cities were considered large enough to run their own county-level services and so were made county boroughs, independent from the new county councils. Urban sanitary districts which straddled county boundaries were placed entirely in one county. A new County of London was created covering the area which had been administered by the Metropolitan Board of Works since 1856, which covered the City of London and parts of Middlesex, Surrey and Kent. In those counties where the quarter sessions had been held separately for different parts of the county, separate county councils were created for each part.

The area controlled by a county council was termed an administrative county. The 1888 Act also adjusted the county boundaries for all other purposes, including judicial functions, sheriffs and lieutenants, to match groups of the administrative counties and county boroughs. As such, Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Suffolk and Sussex retained a single sheriff and lieutenant each, despite being split between multiple administrative counties. Yorkshire kept a single sheriff, whilst each of its ridings retained a separate lieutenant and formed their own administrative counties. In 1890 the Isle of Wight was made an administrative county whilst remaining part of Hampshire for other purposes.

Constituencies were not changed by the 1888 Act and so the parliamentary counties continued to be defined as they had been when the constituencies were last reviewed in 1885, by reference to the counties as they had then existed. This led to a mismatch in some areas between the parliamentary counties and the counties as had been adjusted for all other purposes. This lasted until the constituencies were next reviewed in 1918, when they were realigned to nest within the newer versions of the counties.

The 1888 Act used the term &#x27;entire county&#x27; to refer to the wider version of the county, including any associated county boroughs or parts which had been made administrative counties. The informal term &#x27;geographical county&#x27; was also used on Ordnance Survey maps to distinguish the wider version of the county from the administrative counties.

There were various adjustments to county boundaries after 1889. There were numerous changes following the Local Government Act 1894, which converted rural sanitary districts into rural districts and established parish councils, but said that districts and parishes were no longer allowed to straddle county boundaries. The number of county boroughs gradually increased, and boundaries were occasionally adjusted to accommodate urban areas which were developing across county boundaries. In 1931 the boundaries between Gloucestershire, Warwickshire, and Worcestershire were adjusted to transfer 26 parishes between the three counties, largely to eliminate the remaining exclaves not addressed in 1844.

The functions of county councils gradually grew. Notable expansions in their responsibilities included taking over education from the abolished school boards in 1902, and taking over the assistance of the poor from the abolished boards of guardians in 1930.

===Reforms===
A Local Government Boundary Commission was set up in 1945 which reviewed the structure of local government and recommended a significant overhaul, including extensive changes to counties and county boroughs. The commission was wound up in 1949 when the government decided not to pursue these proposals.

A Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London was established in 1957 and a Local Government Commission for England in 1958 to recommend new local government structures. The major outcomes of the work of the commissions came in 1965. The County of London was abolished and was replaced by the Greater London administrative area, which also included most of the remaining part of Middlesex (which was abolished as an administrative county) and areas formerly part of Surrey, Kent, Essex and Hertfordshire. Huntingdonshire was merged with the Soke of Peterborough to form Huntingdon and Peterborough, and the original administrative county of Cambridgeshire was merged with the Isle of Ely to form Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely.

A Royal Commission on Local Government in England was set up in 1966 and produced the Redcliffe-Maud Report in 1969, which recommended the complete redrawing of local government areas in England, replacing the existing counties and districts and having most local government functions exercised by all-purpose unitary authorities. Following the change in government at the 1970 general election, the incoming Conservative administration of Edward Heath abandoned the Redcliffe-Maud proposals, having campaigned against them as part of their election manifesto.

Instead, the Heath government produced the Local Government Act 1972 which reorganised local government from 1 April 1974 into a two-tier structure of counties and districts across the whole of England apart from the Isles of Scilly and Greater London (which retained its two-tier structure of the Greater London Council and London boroughs which had been introduced in 1965). The administrative counties and county boroughs were all abolished, and the lower tier of district councils was reorganised.

The Heath government also reformed the judicial functions which had been organised by geographical counties; the Courts Act 1971 abolished the quarter sessions and assizes with effect from 1972. The sheriffs and lieutenants continued to exist, but both roles had lost powers to become largely ceremonial by the time of the 1970s reforms. As such, following the loss of judicial functions in 1972, the counties&#x27; roles were the administrative functions of local government, plus the limited ceremonial roles of the sheriffs and lieutenants. As part of the reforms under the Local Government Act 1972 the post of sheriff was renamed &#x27;high sheriff&#x27;, and both they and the lieutenants were appointed to the new counties created in 1974.

Whilst the administrative counties and county boroughs were abolished in 1974, the wider geographical or historic counties were not explicitly abolished by the 1972 Act, albeit they were left with no administrative or ceremonial functions.

Following the 1974 reforms there were 45 counties, six of which were classed as metropolitan counties, covering the larger urban areas:

*Greater Manchester
*Merseyside
*South Yorkshire
*Tyne and Wear
*West Midlands
*West Yorkshire
The other 39 counties were classed as non-metropolitan counties:

*Avon
*Bedfordshire
*Berkshire
*Buckinghamshire
*Cambridgeshire
*Cheshire
*Cleveland
*Cornwall
*Cumbria
*Derbyshire
*Devon
*Dorset
*Durham
*East Sussex
*Essex
*Gloucestershire
*Hampshire
*Hereford and Worcester
*Hertfordshire
*Humberside
*Isle of Wight
*Kent
*Lancashire
*Leicestershire
*Lincolnshire
*Norfolk
*North Yorkshire
*Northamptonshire
*Northumberland
*Nottinghamshire
*Oxfordshire
*Shropshire
*Somerset
*Staffordshire
*Suffolk
*Surrey
*Warwickshire
*West Sussex
*Wiltshire

Most of the non-metropolitan counties retained the names of historic counties and were defined by reference to the administrative and geographical counties which preceded them, retaining the same or similar boundaries where practicable. Whilst the Heath government had rejected the more radical Radcliffe-Maud proposals, they did still make adjustments to boundaries where they concluded they were necessary to better align with functional economic areas. For example, the north-western part of Berkshire was transferred to Oxfordshire on account of being separated from the rest of Berkshire by the Berkshire Downs hills and having better connections to the city of Oxford than to Berkshire&#x27;s largest town and administrative centre of Reading. Similarly, Gatwick Airport was transferred from Surrey to West Sussex so that it could be in the same county as Crawley, the adjoining new town.

Four of the non-metropolitan counties established in 1974 were given names that had not previously been used for counties: Avon, Cleveland, Cumbria, and Humberside. Another was a merger of two former counties and combined both their names: Hereford and Worcester. The pre-1974 counties of Cumberland, Rutland, Westmorland, and Huntingdon and Peterborough were considered too small to function efficiently as separate counties, and did not have their names taken forward by new counties. Cumberland and Westmorland were both incorporated into Cumbria (alongside parts of Lancashire and Yorkshire). Huntingdon and Peterborough became lower-tier districts within Cambridgeshire, and Rutland was made a district of Leicestershire.

===Further changes===

The metropolitan county councils were abolished in 1986 after just 12 years in operation. The Greater London Council was abolished at the same time. The metropolitan counties and Greater London continued to legally exist as geographic areas and retained their high sheriffs and lieutenants despite the loss of their upper-tier councils. The lower-tier metropolitan boroughs and London boroughs took on the functions of the abolished councils, with some functions (such as emergency services, civil defence and public transport) being delivered through joint committees.

Further reform in the 1990s allowed the creation of non-metropolitan counties containing a single district, where one council performed both county and district functions. These became informally known as unitary authorities. The first was the Isle of Wight, where the two districts were abolished and the county council took over their functions in 1995.

In 1996, Avon, Cleveland and Humberside were abolished after just 22 years in existence. None of those three had attracted much public loyalty, and there had been campaigns to abolish them, especially in the case of Humberside. Those three counties were split into unitary authorities, each of which was legally a new non-metropolitan county and a district covering the same area, with the district council also performing county functions. Rather than appoint lieutenants and high sheriffs for these new counties created in 1996, it was decided to resurrect the pre-1974 practice of defining counties for the purposes of lieutenancy and shrievalty separately from the local government counties.

Several other unitary authorities were created between 1996 and 1998. Many of these were districts based on larger towns and cities, including several places that had been county boroughs prior to 1974. Being made unitary authorities therefore effectively restored the pre-1974 powers in such cases. Whilst these unitary authorities are legally all non-metropolitan counties, they are rarely referred to as counties other than in the context of local government law.

The pre-1974 counties of Rutland, Herefordshire and Worcestershire also regained their independence. Rutland was made a unitary authority in 1997, and in 1998 Herefordshire was made a unitary authority and Worcestershire was re-established as a two-tier county. Berkshire County Council was abolished in 1998 and the county&#x27;s six districts became unitary authorities, but unusually the non-metropolitan county of Berkshire was not abolished. The six Berkshire unitary authorities are the only ones not to also be non-metropolitan counties.

Further reforms in 2009 and between 2019 and 2023 saw more unitary authorities created within the non-metropolitan counties. Since the most recent changes in 2023, England outside Greater London and the Isles of Scilly has been divided into 84 metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties for local government purposes. The 48 ceremonial counties used for the purposes of lieutenancy have been unchanged since 1998.

== Local government ==
Since the latest changes in 2023 there have been 84 counties for local government purposes, which are categorised as metropolitan or non-metropolitan counties. The non-metropolitan counties may governed by one or two tiers of councils. Those which are governed by one tier (unitary authorities) may either be governed by a county council which also performs the functions of a district, or a district council which also performs the functions of a county. The effect is the same, with only marginal differences in terminology; district councils are elected by wards, county councils by electoral divisions. The local government counties are listed below, with the numbers corresponding to the adjoining map.

*Berkshire (67) (unitary districts being Bracknell Forest, Reading, Slough, West Berkshire, Windsor and Maidenhead, and Wokingham)

===Exceptions===
Greater London and the Isles of Scilly do not form part of any county for the purposes of local government legislation.

;Greater London
Greater London was created in 1965 by the London Government Act 1963 as a &quot;sui generis&quot; administrative area, with the Greater London Council functioning as an upper-tier authority. It consists of the City of London plus 32 London boroughs. It was left unaltered by the 1972 Act. The Greater London Council was abolished along with the metropolitan county councils in 1986.

Since 2000, Greater London has had an elected Assembly and Mayor responsible for strategic local government. Whilst not a county in terms of local government legislation, Greater London is deemed to comprise two counties for the purposes of lieutenancy: the City of London (covering the &#x27;square mile&#x27; at the centre of the conurbation) and a Greater London lieutenancy county covering the rest of the area, being the 32 London boroughs.

;Isles of Scilly
The Council of the Isles of Scilly was formed in 1890 as a &quot;sui generis&quot; district council. It was given the &quot;powers, duties and liabilities&quot; of a county council in 1930. Some functions, such as health and economic development, are shared with Cornwall Council. For lieutenancy purposes the islands form part of the ceremonial county of Cornwall.

==Ceremonial counties==

From 1974 to 1996 the local government counties were also used for the purposes of lieutenancy, with the exceptions that the Isles of Scilly were deemed part of Cornwall for lieutenancy purposes, and Greater London was deemed to be two lieutenancy counties (the City of London and the rest of Greater London) under the Administration of Justice Act 1964.

As unitary authorities began to be created in the mid 1990s it was decided to define counties for the purposes of lieutenancy differently from the local government counties in some cases. This was effectively reverting to the pre-1974 approach, when lieutenancy areas had covered multiple county boroughs and administrative counties. Regulations came into effect in 1996 introducing a new definition of the counties for lieutenancy purposes, being either the local government counties or specified groups of them. On the abolition of Avon, Cleveland and Humberside in 1996 the regulations split the area of Avon for the purposes of lieutenancy between Gloucestershire, Somerset and Bristol (a change from the pre-1974 position when Bristol had been part of the Gloucestershire lieutenancy). Cleveland was split between North Yorkshire and County Durham, and Humberside was split between Lincolnshire and a new &#x27;East Riding of Yorkshire&#x27; lieutenancy county.

The regulations were then consolidated into the Lieutenancies Act 1997. When Herefordshire, Rutland and Worcestershire were re-established as local government counties in 1997 and 1998 no amendment was made to the 1997 Act regarding them, allowing them to also serve as their own lieutenancy areas. The lieutenancy counties have not changed in area since 1998, although the definitions of which local government counties are included in each lieutenancy have been amended to reflect new unitary authorities being created since 1997.

In legislation the lieutenancy areas are described as &#x27;counties for the purposes of the lieutenancies&#x27;; the informal term &#x27;ceremonial county&#x27; has come into usage for such areas, appearing in parliamentary debates as early as 1996. Since the adoption of different definitions of the counties for local government and lieutenancy purposes in 1996 there have been a growing number of instances where a local government county shares a name with a larger ceremonial county. For example the local government (non-metropolitan) county of Gloucestershire is the area administered by Gloucestershire County Council, but the ceremonial county of Gloucestershire additionally includes the unitary authority of South Gloucestershire.

The ceremonial counties and their definitions by reference to local government areas (metropolitan counties, non-metropolitan counties, Greater London and the Isles of Scilly) are as follows:
==Culture==
There is no well-established series of official symbols or flags covering all the counties. From 1889 the newly created county councils could apply to the College of Arms for coats of arms, often incorporating traditional symbols associated with the county. This practice continued as new county councils were created in 1965 and 1974. Such armorial bearings were granted to the council rather than the geographic area of the counties themselves. Some have therefore become obsolete if the council they were granted to no longer exists. A recent series of flags, with varying levels of official adoption, have been established in many of the counties by competition or public poll. County days are a recent innovation in some areas.

There are 17 first-class men&#x27;s county cricket teams that are based on historical English counties. These compete in the County Championship and in the other top-level domestic competitions organised by the England and Wales Cricket Board along with the 18th first-class cricket county - Glamorgan in Wales. There are also 19 English minor county teams which, along with a Wales Minor Counties side, compete for the Minor Counties Championship.

The County Football Associations are roughly based on English counties, with exceptions such as the combinations of Berkshire and Buckinghamshire and Leicestershire and Rutland.

==Postal counties==

The Royal Mail has always required postal addresses to include the name of certain towns, known as post towns, to assist with efficiently directing the mail. Historically they also required the name of the county in which that post town lay to be included as part of the address. There was also a series of official county name abbreviations sanctioned for postal use. For many rural areas and villages the post town to which they were assigned lay in a different county, and so in many places a correct postal address included the name of a county where the specific address was not located. For example the village of Easton on the Hill in Northamptonshire had to include Stamford, Lincolnshire in its address. The postal counties therefore included the same set of towns as the geographical counties, but had quite different boundaries.

The Royal Mail was unable to follow the changes to county boundaries in 1965 and 1974 due to cost constraints and because several new counties had names that were too similar to post towns. The main differences were that Hereford and Worcester, Greater Manchester and Greater London could not be adopted as postal counties and that Humberside had to be split into North Humberside and South Humberside.

The use of postal counties was abandoned by the Royal Mail in 1996 after postcodes had become sufficiently well-established.

<doc id="356741" wikidata="Q1498298" url="?curid=356741" title="Opposed-piston engine">
<text>An opposed-piston engine is a piston engine in which each cylinder has a piston at both ends, and no cylinder head. Petrol and diesel opposed-piston engines have been used mostly in large applications such as ships, military tanks, and factories. Current manufacturers of opposed-piston engines include Cummins, Achates Power, and Fairbanks-Morse Defense (FMDefense).

== Design ==
Compared to contemporary two-stroke engines, which use a conventional design of one piston per cylinder, the advantages of the opposed-piston engine are:
* Eliminating the cylinder head and valve-train, which reduces weight, complexity, cost, heat loss, and friction loss of the engine.
* Creating a uniflow-scavenged movement of gas through the combustion chamber, which avoided the drawbacks originally associated with the crossflow-scavenged designs of early piston-engines.
* A reduced height of the engine

The main drawback was that the two opposing pistons had to be geared together. This added weight and complexity when compared to conventional piston engines, which use a single crankshaft as the power output.

The most common layout was two crankshafts, with the crankshafts geared together (in either the same direction or opposing directions). The Koreyvo, Jumo, and Napier Deltic engines used one piston per cylinder to expose an intake port, and the other to expose an exhaust port. Each piston is referred to as either an intake piston or an exhaust piston, depending on its function in this regard. This layout gives superior scavenging, as gas flow through the cylinder is axial rather than radial, and simplifies design of the piston crowns. In the Jumo 205 and its variants, the upper crankshaft serves the exhaust pistons, and the lower crankshaft the intake pistons. In designs using multiple cylinder banks, each big end bearing serves one inlet and one exhaust piston, using a forked connecting rod for the exhaust piston.

== History ==

=== 1880s to 1930s ===

One of the first opposed-piston engines was the 1882 Atkinson differential engine, which has a power stroke on every rotation of the crankshaft (compared with every second rotation for the contemporary Otto cycle engine), but it was not a commercial success.

In 1898, an Oechelhäuser two-stroke opposed-piston engine producing was installed at the Hoerde ironworks. This design of engine was also produced under licence by manufacturers including Deutsche Kraftgas Gesellschaft in Germany and William Beardmore &amp; Sons in the United Kingdom.

In 1901, the Kansas City Lightning Balanced Gas and Gasoline Engines were gasoline engines producing .

An early opposed-piston car engine was produced by the French company Gobron-Brillié around 1900. On 31 March 1904, a Gobron-Brillié car powered by the opposed-piston engine was the first car ever to exceed 150 km/h with a &quot;World&#x27;s Record Speed&quot; of . On 17 July 1904, the Gobron-Brillié car became the first to exceed for the flying kilometre. The engine used a single crankshaft at one end of the cylinders and a crosshead for the opposing piston.

Another early opposed piston car engine was in the Scottish Arrol-Johnston car, which appears to have been first installed in their 10 hp buckboard c1900. The engine was described and illustrated in some detail in the account of their 12-15 hp car exhibited at the 1905 Olympia Motor-Show. The engine was a four-stroke with two cylinders (with opposed pistons in each) with the crankshaft underneath and the pistons connected by lever arms to the two-throw crankshaft.

The first diesel engine with opposed pistons was a prototype built at Kolomna Locomotive Works in Russia. The designer, Raymond A. Koreyvo, patented the engine in France on 6 November 1907 and displayed the engine at international exhibitions, but it did not reach production. The Kolomna design used a typical layout of two crankshafts connected by gearing.

In 1914, the Simpson&#x27;s Balanced Two-Stroke motorcycle engine was another opposed-piston engine using a single crankshaft beneath the centre of the cylinders with both pistons connected by levers. This engine was a crankcase compression design, with one piston used to uncover the transfer port, and the other to open the exhaust port. The advantage of this design was to avoid the deflector crowns for pistons used by most two-stroke engines at that time.

Doxford Engine Works in the United Kingdom built large opposed-piston engines for marine use, with the first Doxford engine being installed in a ship in 1921. This diesel engine used a single crankshaft at one end of the cylinders and a crosshead for the opposing piston. After World War I, these engines were produced in a number of models, such as the P and J series, with outputs as high as . Production of Doxford engines in the UK ceased in 1980.

Later opposed-piston diesel engines include the 1932 Junkers Jumo 205 aircraft engine built in Germany, which had two crankshafts, not using a design similar to the 1900–1922 Gobron-Brillié engines.


=== 1940s to present ===
The Fairbanks Morse 38 8-1/8 diesel engine, designed in Germany in the 1930s, was used in U.S. submarines in the 1940s and 1950s, and in boats from the 1930s-present. It has been used in locomotives since 1944.

The November 2021 version of the Fairbanks-Morse 38 8-1/8, the FM 38D 8-1/8 Diesel and Dual Fuel, retains the same extra-heavy-duty design and has a rated in-service lifespan of more than 40 years, but now can burn dual fuels (gaseous and liquid fuels, with automatic switchover to full diesel if the gas supply runs out).
The Commer TS3 three-cylinder diesel truck engines, released in 1954, have a single crankshaft beneath the centre of the cylinders with both pistons connected by levers.

Also released in 1954 was the Napier Deltic engine for military boats. It uses three crankshafts, one at each corner, to form the three banks of double-ended cylinders arranged in an equilateral triangle. The Deltic engine was used in British Rail Class 55 and British Rail Class 23 locomotives and to power fast patrol boats and Royal Navy mine sweepers. Beginning in 1962, Gibbs invited Mack Trucks to take part in designing FDNY’s super pumper and its companion tender. DeLaval Turbine was commissioned to design a multistage centrifugal pump with a Napier-Deltic T18-37C diesel to power the pumps.

In 1959, the Leyland L60 six-cylinder diesel engine was introduced. The L60 was produced in the United Kingdom for use in the Chieftain tank. 

The Soviet T-64 tank, produced from 1963–1987, also used an opposed-piston diesel engine developed by Malyshev Factory in Kharkiv. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union Malyshev Factory continued development and production of opposed-piston engines for armored vehicles, such as the three-cylinder used in BTR-4 Butsefal, various upgrades of the 5TD and the six-cylinder for T-64BM2, BM Oplot etc.

In 2014, Achates Power published a technical paper citing a 30% fuel economy improvement when its engine was benchmarked against a next-generation diesel engine equipped with advanced technologies.

Volvo filed for a patent in 2017.

The Diesel Air Dair 100 is a two-cylinder diesel aircraft engine, designed and produced by Diesel Air Ltd of Olney, Buckinghamshire for use in airships, home-built kitplanes, and light aircraft.

In July 2021, Cummins was awarded an $87M contract by the United States Army to complete the development of the Advanced Combat Engine (ACE), a modular and scalable diesel engine solution that uses opposed-piston technology.

==Free-piston engine==
A variation of the opposed-piston design is the free-piston engine, which was first patented in 1934. Free piston engines have no crankshaft, and the pistons are returned after each firing stroke by compression and expansion of air in a separate cylinder. Early applications were for use as an air compressor or as a gas generator for a gas turbine.

<text>The Stelzer engine is a two-stroke opposing-piston free-piston engine design proposed by Frank Stelzer. It uses conjoined pistons in a push-pull arrangement which allows for fewer moving parts and simplified manufacturing. An engine of the same design appeared on the cover of the February 1969 issue of Mechanix Illustrated magazine. 

==Operation==
There are two combustion chambers and a central precompression chamber. Control of the air flow between the precompression chamber and the combustion chambers is made by stepped piston rods.

==Applications==
Applications envisaged for the engine include driving:
* An air compressor
* A hydraulic pump
* A linear generator

==Prototypes==
A prototype engine was demonstrated in Frankfurt in 1983 and Opel was reported to be interested in it. In 1982, the Government of Ireland agreed to pay half the cost of a factory at Shannon Airport to manufacture the engines. A prototype car with a Stelzer engine and electric transmission was shown at a German motor show in 1983.

<text>Fredric Ruff Jameson (April 14, 1934 – September 22, 2024) was an American literary critic, philosopher and Marxist political theorist. He was best known for his analysis of contemporary cultural trends, particularly his analysis of postmodernity and capitalism. Jameson&#x27;s best-known books include &quot;Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism&quot; (1991) and &quot;The Political Unconscious&quot; (1981).

Jameson was the Knut Schmidt Nielsen Professor of Comparative Literature, Professor of Romance Studies (French), and Director of the Institute for Critical Theory at Duke University. In 2012, the Modern Language Association gave Jameson its sixth Award for Lifetime Scholarly Achievement.

==Early life and works==
Fredric Ruff Jameson was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on April 14, 1934. He was the only child of Frank S. Jameson (&quot;c.&quot;1890–?), a New York-born medical doctor with his own private practice, and Bernice &quot;née&quot; Ruff (&quot;c.&quot;1904–1966), a Michigan-born Barnard College graduate who did not work outside the family home. Both his parents had non-wage income over $50 in 1939 (about USD$1130 in 2024). By April 1935 he moved with his parents to Gloucester City, New Jersey, and by 1949 the family occupied a house in the nearby middle-class suburb of Haddon Heights, New Jersey. He graduated from Moorestown Friends School in 1950.

He completed a BA in French with highest honors at Haverford College, where he was elected to the Phi Beta Kappa society in his junior year. His professors at Haverford included Wayne Booth, to whom &quot;A Singular Modernity&quot; (2002) is dedicated. After graduation in 1954 he briefly traveled to Europe, studying at Aix-en-Provence, Munich, and Berlin, where he learned of new developments in continental philosophy, including the rise of structuralism. He returned to America the following year to study at Yale University under Erich Auerbach in pursuit of a PhD, which was awarded in 1959 for a dissertation on &quot;The Origins of Sartre&#x27;s Style&quot;.

===Career summary===
From 1959 to 1967 he taught French and Comparative Literature at Harvard University.

He was employed by the University of California, San Diego from 1967 to 1976, where he worked alongside Herbert Marcuse. He taught classes on Marxist literary criticism, the Frankfurt School, the French novel and poetry, and Sartre. He was then hired by Yale University through Paul de Man in 1976, and by the University of California, Santa Cruz in 1983.

In 1985 he joined Duke University as Professor of Literature and Professor of Romance Studies. He established the literary studies program at Duke and held the William A. Lane Professorship of Comparative Literature, renamed in 2013, as Knut Schmidt Nielsen Distinguished Professorship of Comparative Literature.

In 1985 he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

===Early works===
Erich Auerbach would prove to be a lasting influence on Jameson&#x27;s thought. This was already apparent in Jameson&#x27;s doctoral dissertation, published in 1961 as &quot;Sartre: The Origins of a Style&quot;. Auerbach&#x27;s concerns were rooted in the German philological tradition; his works on the history of style analyzed literary form within social history. Jameson would follow in these steps, examining the articulation of poetry, history, philology, and philosophy in the works of Jean-Paul Sartre, who was the subject of his dissertation.

Jameson&#x27;s work focused on the relation between the style of Sartre&#x27;s writings and the political and ethical positions of his existentialist philosophy. The occasional Marxian aspects of Sartre&#x27;s work were glossed over in this book; Jameson would return to them in the following decade.

Jameson&#x27;s dissertation, though it drew on a long tradition of European cultural analysis, differed markedly from the prevailing trends of Anglo-American academia (which were empiricism and logical positivism in philosophy and linguistics, and New Critical formalism in literary criticism). It nevertheless earned Jameson a position at Harvard University.

===Research into Marxism===
His interest in Sartre led Jameson to intense study of Marxist literary theory. Even though Karl Marx was becoming an important influence in American social science, partly through the influence of the many European intellectuals who had sought refuge from the Second World War in the United States, such as Theodor Adorno, the literary and critical work of the Western Marxists was still largely unknown in American academia in the late-1950s and early-1960s.

Jameson&#x27;s shift toward Marxism was also driven by his increasing political connection with the New Left and pacifist movements, as well as by the Cuban Revolution, which Jameson took as a sign that &quot;Marxism was alive and well as a collective movement and a culturally productive force&quot;. His research focused on critical theory: thinkers of, and influenced by, the Frankfurt School, such as Kenneth Burke, György Lukács, Ernst Bloch, Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Herbert Marcuse, Louis Althusser, and Sartre, who viewed cultural criticism as an integral feature of Marxist theory. In 1969, Jameson co-founded the Marxist Literary Group with a number of his graduate students at the University of California, San Diego.

While the Orthodox Marxist view of ideology held that the cultural &quot;superstructure&quot; was completely determined by the economic &quot;base&quot;, the Western Marxists critically analyzed culture as a historical and social phenomenon alongside economic production and distribution or political power relationships. They held that culture must be studied using the Hegelian concept of immanent critique: the theory that adequate description and criticism of a philosophical or cultural text must be carried out in the same terms that text itself employs, in order to develop its internal inconsistencies in a manner that allows intellectual advancement. Marx highlighted immanent critique in his early writings, derived from Hegel&#x27;s development of a new form of dialectical thinking that would attempt, as Jameson comments, &quot;to lift itself mightily up by its own bootstraps&quot;.

===Narrative and history===
History came to play an increasingly central role in Jameson&#x27;s interpretation of both the reading (consumption) and writing (production) of literary texts. Jameson marked his full-fledged commitment to Hegelian-Marxist philosophy with the publication of &quot;The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act,&quot; the opening slogan of which is &quot;always historicize&quot; (1981). &quot;The Political Unconscious&quot; takes as its object not the literary text itself, but rather the interpretive frameworks by which it is now constructed. As Jonathan Culler has observed, &quot;The Political Unconscious&quot; emerged as an alternative method to interpret literary narratives.

The book&#x27;s argument emphasized history as the &quot;ultimate horizon&quot; of literary and cultural analysis. It borrowed notions from the structuralist tradition and from Raymond Williams&#x27;s work in cultural studies, and joined them to a largely Marxist view of labor (whether blue-collar or intellectual) as the focal point of analysis. Jameson&#x27;s readings exploited both the explicit formal and thematic choices of the writer and the unconscious framework guiding these. Artistic choices that were ordinarily viewed in purely aesthetic terms were recast in terms of historical literary practices and norms, in an attempt to develop a systematic inventory of the constraints they imposed on the artist as an individual creative subject. To further this meta-commentary, Jameson described the &quot;ideologeme&quot;, or &quot;the smallest intelligible unit of the essentially antagonistic collective discourses of social classes&quot;, the smallest legible residue of the real-life, ongoing struggles occurring between social classes.

Jameson&#x27;s establishment of history as the only pertinent factor in this analysis, which derived the categories governing artistic production from their historical framework, was paired with a bold theoretical claim. His book claimed to establish Marxian literary criticism, centered in the notion of an artistic mode of production, as the most all-inclusive and comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding literature. According to Vincent B. Leitch, the publication of &quot;The Political Unconscious&quot; &quot;rendered Jameson the leading Marxist literary critic in America.&quot;

===Analysis of postmodernism===

====Background====
It is Jameson’s contribution to a conception and analysis of &quot;postmodernism&quot; that has had the most impact in its breadth and reach. At the time of his death in 2024, it was generally recognized that he was the preeminent critic of postmodernism. Jameson’s contention was that postmodernism is the cultural expression of our own current period of late capitalism. Postmodernism represents the form of an enormous cultural expansion into an economy of spectacle and style, rather than the production of goods.

Jameson developed this form of analysis during a time when “an art-historical debate had wondered for several years whether our age had moved beyond modern art and on to ‘postmodern’ art”. Jameson joined in on the debate in 1984 with his article titled &quot;Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism&quot; that was first published in the journal &quot;New Left Review&quot;. He later expanded the article into a book, which he published in 1991.

====Jameson’s argument====
Jameson’s argument centered around his assertion that the various phenomena of the postmodern had been, or could have been, understood successfully within a modernist framework. This differed from the most prominent views of the postmodern condition that existed at that time. In Jameson’s view, postmodernity&#x27;s merging of all discourse into an undifferentiated whole was the result of the colonization of the cultural sphere—which had retained at least partial autonomy during the prior modernist era—by a newly organized corporate capitalism.

Following Adorno and Horkheimer&#x27;s analysis of the culture industry, Jameson discussed this phenomenon in his critical discussion of architecture, film, narrative, and visual arts, as well as in his strictly philosophical work. For Jameson, postmodernism, as a form of mass-culture driven by capitalism, pervades every aspect of our daily lives.

====Key concepts====
Two of Jameson&#x27;s best-known claims from &quot;Postmodernism, or, the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism&quot; are that post-modernity is characterized by &quot;pastiche&quot; and a &quot;crisis in historicity&quot;. And since postmodernism —as was mentioned above —represents the form of an enormous cultural expansion into an economy of spectacle and style, rather than the production of goods, Jameson argued that parody (which implies a moral judgment or a comparison with societal norms) was replaced by pastiche (collage and other forms of juxtaposition without a normative grounding). Jameson recognized that modernism frequently &quot;quotes&quot; from different cultures and historical periods, but he argues that postmodern cultural texts indiscriminately cannibalize these elements, erasing any sense of critical or historical distance, resulting in pure pastiche.

Relatedly, Jameson argues that the postmodern era suffers from a crisis in historicity: &quot;there no longer does seem to be any organic relationship between the [...] history we learn from schoolbooks and the lived experience of the current, multinational, high-rise, stagflated city of the newspapers and of our own everyday life&quot;.

Jameson&#x27;s analysis of postmodernism attempts to view it as historically grounded; he therefore explicitly rejects any moralistic opposition to postmodernity as a cultural phenomenon. Instead, Jameson insists upon a Hegelian immanent critique that would &quot;think the cultural evolution of late capitalism dialectically, as catastrophe and progress all together&quot;.

====Other concepts====
Some of Jameson&#x27;s other well-known concepts and philosophical contributions —not mentioned in the preceding section or tangential to his critique of postmodernism— include the concepts of &quot;cognitive mapping&quot; (adapted from Kevin A. Lynch; a form of class consciousness mediated by popular culture that corresponds to the era of capitalist globalization), the &quot;vanishing mediator&quot;, totality as conspiracy, &quot;alternate modernity&quot; (the postcolonial notion of distinct regional pathways of capitalism, linked to the political project of BRICS), and antagonism as the principle of totalisation.

===Later work===
Several of Jameson’s later works, along with &quot;Postmodernism&quot;, are part of what he called both a &quot;sequence&quot; and &quot;project&quot; entitled &quot;The Poetics of Social Forms&quot;. This project attempts, in Sara Danius&#x27;s words, to &quot;provide a general history of aesthetic forms, at the same time seeking to show how this history can be read in tandem with a history of social and economic formations&quot;. While the individual works are formally named on the flyleaf of &quot;Inventions of a Present&quot;, its more nuanced structure—six volumes comprising seven publications grouped into three subdivisions—can be gleaned from mentions in the books themselves.

&quot;Archaeologies of the Future&quot; is a study of utopia and science fiction that was launched at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. &quot;The Antinomies of Realism&quot; won the 2014 Truman Capote Award for Literary Criticism.

Alongside this project, Jameson published three related studies of dialectical theory: &quot;Valences of the Dialectic&quot; (2009), which includes Jameson&#x27;s critical responses to Slavoj Žižek, Gilles Deleuze, and other contemporary theorists; &quot;The Hegel Variations&quot; (2010), a commentary on Hegel&#x27;s &quot;Phenomenology of Spirit&quot;; and &quot;Representing Capital: A Reading of Volume One&quot; (2011), an analysis of Marx&#x27;s &quot;Das Kapital&quot;.

An overview of Jameson&#x27;s work, &quot;Fredric Jameson: Live Theory,&quot; by Ian Buchanan, was published in 2007.

== Personal life and death ==
Jameson was married to Janet Jameson, and then to Susan Willis, and had two sons and five daughters in the two marriages. He died at his home in Killingworth, Connecticut, on September 22, 2024, at the age of 90.

== Recognition, influence, and legacy ==

=== MLA awards and honors ===
The Modern Language Association (MLA) recognized Jameson throughout his career. In 1971, Jameson earned the MLA’s William Riley Parker Prize. Twenty years later, it awarded him its 1991 James Russell Lowell Prize for &quot;Postmodernism, or, The Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism&quot;. 

The latter has remained a landmark publication in its field since it was published in 1991, and is still Duke University Press’s all-time bestseller (as of 2024). Jameson was again recognized by the MLA, this time in 2012, with its MLA Lifetime Achievement Award.

=== Holberg International Memorial Prize ===
In 2008, Jameson was awarded the annual Holberg International Memorial Prize in recognition of his career-long research &quot;on the relation between social formations and cultural forms&quot;. The prize, which was worth (approximately $648,000), was presented to Jameson by Tora Aasland, Norwegian Minister of Education and Research, in Bergen, Norway, on November 26, 2008.

=== Lyman Tower Sargent Distinguished Scholar Award ===
In 2009, Jameson was awarded the Lyman Tower Sargent Distinguished Scholar Award by the North American Society for Utopian Studies. Jameson was given credit for his ”significant role in introducing to an English reading audience the rich theorizations of Utopia found in German critical theory, in works written by Walter Benjamin, Herbert Marcuse, and most significantly, Ernst Bloch.” It was also noted that “the question of Utopia is central to all of Jameson’s work.”

=== Influence in China ===
Jameson has had an influence on the theorization of the postmodern in China. In mid-1985, shortly after the beginning of the cultural fever (early 1985 to the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre)—a period in Chinese intellectual history characterized in part by intense interest in Western critical theory, literary theory, and related disciplines—Jameson discussed the idea of postmodernism in China in lectures at Peking University and the newly founded Shenzhen University.

In 1987, Jameson published a book entitled &quot;Postmodernism and Cultural Theories.&quot; Although the Chinese intelligentsia&#x27;s engagement with postmodernism would not begin in earnest until the nineties, &quot;Postmodernism and Cultural Theories&quot; was to become a keystone text in that engagement; as scholar Wang Ning writes, its influence on Chinese thinkers would be impossible to overestimate.

This debate over postmodernism, in part fueled by Jameson, was at its most intense from 1994 to 1997, carried on by Chinese intellectuals both inside and outside the mainland; particularly important contributions came from Zhao Yiheng in London, Xu Ben in the United States, and Zhang Xudong, also in the United States, who had gone on to study under Jameson as a doctoral student at Duke.

=== Legacy ===
In 2011, Rey Chow, then chair of Duke University&#x27;s literature program, reflected on Jameson&#x27;s career on the occasion of presenting him with a lifetime achievement award:

Robert T. Tally Jr.&#x27;s review for &quot;Jacobin&quot; of the 2024 work &quot;Inventions of a Present: The Novel in Its Crisis of Globalization&quot; described Jameson as:

A memorial piece published by the editorial team of the Marxist journal &quot;Historical Materialism: Research in Critical Marxist Theory&quot; described Jameson as an &quot;intellectual giant&quot; responsible for an &quot;enduring legacy that has inspired generations of thinkers, activists and scholars&quot;. They praised Jameson for his &quot;militant commitment to a materialist reading of moments of struggle and revolt, utopia and liberation in cultural texts.&quot;

Another memorial essay in &quot;The Nation&quot; observed that Jameson has emerged as a figure who &quot;not only amassed one of the most impressive bodies of work within his field but who also was, fundamentally, someone who believed in criticism as a discourse, between teacher and pupil, between the work and the public&quot;.

Born in Hanham near Bristol, Cribb moved to London at the age of 13 and after working as a bell-hanger sought work as a coal porter in Wapping.

==Boxing career==
His first fight was with George Maddox on 7 January 1805 at Wood Green in Middlesex, now part of north London. Victory over Maddox, followed by another over Tom Blake a month later, persuaded him to become a professional pugilist, under the supervision of Captain Robert Barclay.

George Nicholls was the only fighter to defeat Cribb, on 20 July 1805. Later, the foremost prizefighting reporter, Pierce Egan, stated that he was aware that some &quot;friends of the CHAMPION&quot; had encouraged the myth that Cribb enjoyed an unbeaten career by &quot;withholding the name of his vanquisher&quot; (&quot;Boxiana&quot;, vol. 1).

On 8 April 1807 Cribb beat Jem Belcher (who had been English champion from 1800 to 1805). The fight lasted 44 rounds and took place at Moulsey Hurst, the major prizefighting venue at the time. Following the retirement of reigning champion John Gully, Cribb fought Bob Gregson in October 1808 to determine the new English champion. This fight also took place at Moulsey Hurst and resulted in a win for Cribb in 23 rounds. Cribb then defended his title successfully at Epsom Downs Racecourse in a second bout against Jem Belcher on 1 February 1809. 

On 18 December 1810 he fought an American, former slave Tom Molineaux, at Copthorne Common in Sussex. Cribb beat Molineaux in 35 rounds. The fight was controversial for two reasons: Molineaux was injured when the crowd invaded the ring, and Cribb at one point seemed to have taken longer than the specified time to return to the centre of the ring. Cribb then faced Molineaux again in 1811, beating him at Thistleton Gap in Rutland in 11 rounds. 

Having beaten Gregson, Belcher and Molineaux, Cribb&#x27;s reputation was so high that he received no further challenges for a further eleven years, and eventually retired from the ring in 1822. Dowling (1841) records that &#x27;On 15th May 1822, Cribb publicly resigned the championship on the stage of the Fives Court, on which occasion he was presented with a belt, and was succeeded by Tom Spring&#x27;.

==After retirement==
Cribb became a coal merchant (and part-time boxing trainer). Later he worked as a pub landlord, running the Union Arms, Panton Street, close to Haymarket in central London.

In 1839 he relocated to Woolwich in south-east London where he died in 1848, aged 66. He was buried in the churchyard of St Mary Magdalene, Woolwich – where a monument to his memory was erected.

== Legacy ==
Cribb&#x27;s tomb, in the shape of a lion resting his paw on an urn, still stands in St Mary&#x27;s Gardens in Woolwich. Also in Woolwich, a road in the Royal Arsenal area has been named in his honour.

The Tom Cribb pub is located at 36 Panton Street, St James, London. This is the same address as the Union Arms, which was originally 26 Panton Street, but later renumbered.

There is a popular local legend in the Bristol area that Cribbs Causeway, a road not far from Hanham that has given its name to a major out-of-town retail park and entertainment complex, was named after Tom Cribb. Despite being proved to be false, this has not stopped the legend from continuing.

An English footwear brand named after Thomas Cribb existed between 2003 and 2007. The brand name &quot;Thomas Cribb&quot; is currently registered to the creators of the brand.

===Dramatic and literary references===
Tom Hyer, the first recognised American heavyweight champion, portrayed the character &quot;Tom Cribb&quot; in a scene from Pierce Egan&#x27;s &quot;Tom and Jerry, or Life in London&quot; during a single performance at the National Theatre (Boston, Massachusetts) on 9 March 1849.

Cribb features prominently in George MacDonald Fraser’s novel &quot;Black Ajax&quot;, a fictionalised account of Tom Molineaux&#x27;s life. In Charles Dickens&#x27; comic novel &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; (ch.9), Cribb is humorously cited as the inventor of a defensive stance used by the boy Bailey, as the landlady Mrs Todgers aims a smack at his head.

Cribb and Molineux are mentioned in the opening chapter of &quot;War of the Roses&quot; by Warren Adler. In the novel, the boxers had been immortalized in a pair of small Staffordshire porcelain figures, and the ill-fated couple bid against each other to obtain the figures during an estate auction. 

Cribb is noted in one episode (&quot;The Detective Wore Silk Drawers&quot; - largely centred on prize-fighting) of the first series of Granada Television&#x27;s Victorian crime drama &quot;Cribb&quot;, in which one of Cribb&#x27;s men speculates whether he is descended from the famous boxer.

Cribb&#x27;s fights with Molineaux, was turned into a 2014 play by Ed Viney called &quot;Prize Fighters&quot;.

Cribb is also mentioned in the novel &quot;Mauler&quot; by Shawn Williamson. He appears to introduce the exotic Tasmanian Tiger (thylacine), the hero of the story, also known as Mauler and Cu´chulain.

Cribb is memorialised in &quot;The Letter of Marque&quot;, 12th in the Aubrey-Maturin series of novels by Patrick O&#x27;Brian. In the novel, one of the captain&#x27;s favorite personal long cannons is named &quot;Tom Cribb&quot;.

Georgette Heyer&#x27;s 1935 novel, Regency Buck, opens with Cribb&#x27;s fight with Molineaux at Thistleton Gap in Rutland in 1811.

<text>Härnösand County, or &quot;Härnösands län&quot;, was a county of the Swedish Empire, between 1645 and 1654. The seat of residence for the Governor was in Härnösand.

It included the Provinces of Ångermanland, Medelpad and Jämtland.

== Creation ==

The county was created in 1645 when Sweden conquered Jämtland and Härjedalen. They had previously belonged to Norway. Norrland County was split into two and the new territories were assigned to the two halves. Jämtland formed part of the new Härnösand County, and Härjedalen became part of Hudiksvall County. Nine years later they were merged again as the Västernorrland County.

== Governors ==

The county had two governors while it existed.

* 1645–1653 Hans Strijk 
* 1653–1654 Anders Appelbom

When the county merged into Västernorrland Appelbom did not continue as governor. Instead Erik Larsson Sparre, who had governed Hudiksvall, took on the governorship.

<text>The , &quot;North and South court period&quot;, also known as the Northern and Southern Courts period), spanning from 1336 to 1392, was a period that occurred during the formative years of the Muromachi (Ashikaga) shogunate of Japanese history.During the early period, there existed a Northern Imperial Court, established by Ashikaga Takauji in Kyoto, and a Southern Imperial Court, established by Emperor Go-Daigo in Yoshino. Ideologically, the two courts fought for 50 years, with the South giving up to the North in 1392. However, in reality the Northern court was under the power of the Ashikaga shogunate and had little real independence.

The destruction of the Kamakura shogunate of 1333 and the failure of the Kenmu Restoration in 1336 opened up a legitimacy crisis for the new shogunate. Institutional changes in the estate system (&quot;shōen&quot;) that formed the bedrock of the income of nobles and warriors altered the status of the various social groups. The establishment of the Ashikaga shogunate broadened the economic base of the warriors, while undercutting the noble proprietors. However, this trend had started already with the Kamakura &quot;bakufu&quot;.

==Background==
The main conflicts that contributed to the outbreak of the civil war between the courts were the growing conflict between the Hōjō clan and other warrior groups in the wake of the Mongol invasions of Japan of 1274 and 1281 and the failure of the Kenmu Restoration, which triggered the struggle between the supporters of the imperial loyalists and supporters of the Ashikaga clan.

Disaffection towards the Hōjō-led Kamakura regime appeared among the warriors towards the end of the 13th century. This resentment was caused by the growing influence of the Hōjō over other warrior families within the regime. The Mongol invasions were the main cause behind this centralization of power that took place during the regency of Hōjō Tokimune (1268–1284). During the crisis, three things occurred: Hōjō family appointments to the council of state increased; the Hōjō private family council became the most important decision making body; and direct vassals of the Hōjō were increasingly promoted to the &quot;shugo&quot; (governor) posts. This reduced the base of support to encompass Hōjō family members and their direct vassals. When a coalition against the Hōjō emerged in 1331, it took only two years to topple the regime.

Since wealth in pre-industrial, agrarian societies is tied to land, land became the main reason for much discontent among the warrior class. Since the Kamakura period, victory in battle would be rewarded by land grants. Due to the nature of a foreign invasion, the victory against the Mongol invasions meant that there were no lands to hand out to the victors.

When the Kamakura bakufu was destroyed in 1333, the Kyoto court society emerged to confront the warrior class. In the transition from the Heian to the Kamakura period, the warriors were free from the domination of court patrimonialism. With the demise of the Kamakura, the imperial court attempted to restore its power in the Kenmu Restoration. Not until the Meiji Restoration of the 19th century did this occur again.

=== Kenmu Restoration: 1333–1336 ===
In the spring of 1333, the Emperor Go-Daigo and his supporters planned to restore the glory of the imperial court. Emperor Daigo (AD 901–923), who lived at a time when the court had no strong rivals and effective rule was exercised directly from the throne, became Go-Daigo&#x27;s adopted name and model. The Kenmu Restoration was a conscious movement to restore the imperial power vis-a-vis the warrior class. Two of the movement&#x27;s greatest spokesmen were Prince Morinaga and Kitabatake Chikafusa. Prince Morinaga was Go-Daigo&#x27;s son, and archrival to Ashikaga Takauji since he advocated the militarization of the nobles as a necessary step towards effective rule. Morinaga epitomized Chikafusa as the latter was a Kyoto noble who was also military general. During the long siege in Hitachi (1338–1343), Chikafusa wrote the &quot;Jinnō Shōtōki&quot;, an influential work on the legitimacy of the Japanese imperial system. This text would later become an ideological base of the Meiji Restoration in the 19th century.

However, the Kenmu Restoration failed due to Go-Daigo&#x27;s desire to restore not only imperial power, but also its culture. He wrote a treatise (&quot;Kenmu Nenchū Gyōji&quot;) to revive court ceremonies that had fallen out of use. In 1336 Takauji rebelled against the imperial court and proclaimed the beginning of a new shogunate. After his proclamation, he was forced to retreat to Kyūshū after the imperialist forces of Kitabatake Akiie attacked and defeated him near Kyoto. This betrayal of the Kenmu Restoration by Takauji blackened his name in later periods of Japanese history, and officially started the Nanboku-chō War. Earlier historiography taught the Restoration failed due to the ineffectiveness in rewarding lands to the samurai. However, it is now clear that the Restoration was effective in this respect. Therefore, Takauji&#x27;s rebellion and desire to create a new warrior regime was a prime determinant in the Restoration&#x27;s failure. His rebellion encouraged the warrior class who desired to see the creation of another military regime modeled after the Kamakura bakufu.

The Nanboku-chō War was an ideological struggle between loyalists who wanted the Emperor back in power, and those who believed in creating another military regime modeled after Kamakura. Chikafusa was pragmatic on the need for warriors to participate in the Restoration but a severe divergence between Chikafusa and Takauji polarized the leaders for many years. The failure of the Restoration led to the emergence of the Ashikaga shogunate.

==Internal conflicts: 1350s==
Takauji was nominally shōgun but, having proved not to be up to the task of ruling the country, for more than ten years Ashikaga Tadayoshi governed in his stead. Relations soured between the brothers during the Kannō disturbance. This started when Takauji made Kō no Moronao his &quot;shitsuji&quot; (deputy), which led Tadayoshi to unsuccessfully have him assassinated. His plot was discovered, so Tadayoshi in 1349 was forced by Moronao to leave the government, shave his head and become a Buddhist monk under the name Keishin. In 1350 he rebelled and joined his brother&#x27;s enemies, the supporters of the Southern Court, whose Emperor Go-Murakami appointed him general of his entire army. In 1351 he defeated Takauji, occupied Kyoto, and entered Kamakura. During the same year he captured and executed the Kō brothers at Mikage (Settsu Province). The following year his fortunes turned and he was defeated by Takauji at Sattayama. A reconciliation between the brothers proved to be brief. Tadayoshi fled to Kamakura, but Takauji pursued him there with an army. In March 1352, shortly after an ostensible second reconciliation, Tadayoshi died suddenly, according to the &quot;Taiheiki&quot; by poisoning.

===Reasons of conflict===
In the 1350s, the Kannō disturbance and its aftermath divided and nearly destroyed the early regime. This event divided the Muromachi regime and put a temporary hold on integration. On the surface the incident appeared as a personal struggle between Tadayoshi against the Kō brothers, backed by Takauji. However, differences in opinion regarding the estate system and the separation of bureaucracies controlled by Takauji and Tadayoshi played a larger part in the conflict.

Since the bureaucracy were under separate jurisdictions between Takauji and Tadayoshi, this created a disunited administration. Takauji was the leader of the house vassals, and thus controlled the Board of Retainers where disciplinary actions towards house vassals: brigandage and other crimes were prosecuted. He also led the Office of Rewards which heard claims of and to enfeoff deserving vassals. It was used to enroll new warriors who were potential adversaries of the regime.

Tadayoshi meanwhile led the Board of Inquiry which had control over the judicial functions of the regime. The major judicial organ, the Board of Coadjutors, decided on all land dispute cases and quarrels involving inheritance. Bureaucrats (&quot;bugyōnin&quot;) for the new regime were recruited from the ranks of those who served the Hōjō regime before its fall. They were valuable because they knew how to read and write, a task beyond the reach of most warriors.

Takauji encouraged innovation, while Tadayoshi was a conservative who wanted to preserve the policies of the past. As a military leader, Takauji appointed vassals to &quot;shugo&quot; posts as a reward for battlefield heroics, and he divided the &quot;shōen&quot; estates giving half of it to his vassals in fief or as stewardships, both of which was contested by Tadayoshi. He also opposed any sort of outright division of estate lands.

All this led to conflict and resulted in the regime losing its support. Deep divisions between members of the Ashikaga family strengthened the opposition. Both Tadayoshi and Takauji enacted token submissions to the Southern Court to push their own agendas: Tadayoshi desired to destroy the Kō brothers, and Takauji wanted to defeat Tadayoshi.

===Rise of the Southern Court===
The incident led reinvigorations on the war effort of the Southern Court. To a large extent this renewed offensive was made possible by turncoats from the Muromachi regime. The imperialist offensive of 1352 directed against Takauji in Kamakura was made possible by the vast numbers of former adherents of Tadayoshi who became supporters of the imperialist leader Nitta Yoshimune. The imperialist offensive against Kyoto in 1353 was made possible through the defection of the &quot;shugo&quot; lord Yamana Tokiuji; Tadayoshi&#x27;s adopted son, Ashikaga Tadafuyu, became the leader of the western armies of the Southern Court during the imperialist offensives against Kyoto in 1353 and 1354.

==Rise of the &quot;shugo&quot; lords==

The shōgun Ashikaga Takauji appointed branch family members as &quot;shugo&quot; lords in the different provinces of western and central Japan. Ashikaga branch families appointed to &quot;shugo&quot; posts included the Hosokawa, Yamana, Imagawa, Hatakeyama, Niki, Kira, Shiba, Ishido, and the Isshiki families. While some warriors were appointed to &quot;shugo&quot; posts. Successful generals, who were at the same time branch family heads who had cast in their lot with Takauji&#x27;s rebellion, were the ones often rewarded with the post. The cost of not tying them to the regime was to lose their support, and to encourage their independence from the regime.

The &quot;shugo&quot; acted as governors, and served the function of mediating between the regime center and periphery. As lords in their own right, they represented the authority of the regime in the provinces. The &quot;shugo&quot; of this period had greater power than that of the Kamakura, including sending envoys where land disputes occurred, law enforcement, issuing &quot;hanzei&quot; (a half-tax), and to levy taxes. They came to hold much greater authority than the samurai houseman by virtue of having a province-wide appointment. After 1372, &quot;shugo&quot; lords were given the responsibility to collect taxes (&quot;tansen&quot;) on landowners, nobles and samurai. As middlemen, the &quot;shugo&quot; profited by inflating the taxes. On the 1370s onwards the &quot;shugo&quot; were given the added responsibility of overseeing a new regime centered tax. Warrior families since the Kamakura period were characterized by the use of headship rights (&quot;soryo&quot;) where leadership over branch families was accorded to the leader of the main family. However, headship rights were extremely unstable as branch families often asserted their own independence, particularly as new generations emerged to dilute the ties of kinship.

In some provinces, the Ashikaga failed to displace the original &quot;shugo&quot; families: the Sasaki, Togashi (of the famed Togashi Masachika), Takeda and the Ogasawara in the central provinces, and the Shimazu, Otomo and Shoni in Kyūshū. Those provincial families who had accumulated power throughout the Kamakura period, like the Ouchi of Nagato and the Shimazu of Satsuma, were lords in their own right and thus less dependent on the regime and on their &quot;shugo&quot; titles. There was the defection of local samurai families like the Mori, and &quot;shugo&quot; lords continued to act in a dangerously independent manner until the latter half of the 14th century. In the central and western provinces roughly half were new appointees. During the Kannō Incident, Ashikaga headship (&quot;soryo&quot;) ties to the new appointees did not prevent these &quot;shugo&quot; from outright rebellion towards the regime at all. In fact, the coercive institutions of the regime were woefully lacking in this time period vis-a-vis the &quot;shugo&quot; lords. However, some weaker &quot;shugo&quot; lords who had not yet built up their power in the provinces had a vested interest in maintaining their links to the regime.

===&quot;Shugo&quot; usurpation of civil functions and &quot;shugo uke&quot;===
The office of civil governor was gradually usurped by the &quot;shugo,&quot; he was able to make his provincial power effective through the ties of vassalage with the samurai who had taken over the estate lands during the Nanboku-chō War, and with the samurai residing on public lands (&quot;kokugaryo&quot;). The &quot;shugo&quot; lords have certain legitimate duties given to them by the Muromachi regime, and feudal lords attempting to enfeoff vassals. During the Nanboku-chō War, samurai stewards frequently took the lands of nobles and converted them into private holdings (&quot;chigyo&quot;) illegally. This led to the total liquidation of the estate system. The &quot;shugo&quot; lords also participated in this wholesale land grab by accumulating former estates under their control by enfeoffing samurai on them. This encroachment on land caused security problems for all landed interests from petty samurai to the &quot;kokujin&quot;, and led local samurai to seek intermediary ties to the &quot;shugo&quot; lords in the form of vassalage as the &quot;shugo&quot; could provide some form of local security.

Vassalage ties between the &quot;shugo&quot; lord and &quot;kokujin&quot; was called a &quot;shugo-uke&quot; (&quot;shugo&quot; contracts)&quot;.&quot; This was where a noble proprietor would give the responsibility of managing his estate to the &quot;shugo&quot; in exchange for a guaranteed year end (&quot;nengu&quot;) income delivered to the proprietor residing in the capital. The &quot;shugo&quot; lord then enfeoffed vassal samurai (&quot;hikan&quot;) on those estates as managers. The &quot;shugo&quot; contracts tied the interests of the &quot;shugo&quot; lord, the samurai &quot;kokujin&quot; and the noble together, but were not based on equality of interests. The contract was most favorable to the &quot;shugo&quot; lord who used this instrument to expand ties of vassalage with the local samurai (&quot;kokujin&quot;), and expand his land base at the expense of the nobles.

&quot;Shugo&quot; contracts emerged in the 1340s and gradually became widespread. S&quot;hugo&quot; lords gave the management of the estate to samurai in exchange for military service, but the noble was stripped of all powers on the estate, and was reduced to waiting for his portion of the year end (&quot;nengu&quot;) income. The noble hired tax overseers (&quot;nengu daikan&quot;) at an exorbitant amount to guarantee his own portion of the income. Noble income (already reduced by the &quot;kokujin&quot; and the &quot;shugo&quot; lord) was further reduced once the tax overseer took his half. This reduction in noble income was the result of gradual non-payment by the &quot;shugo&quot; and samurai. Therefore, the nobles hired moneylenders (&quot;doso&quot;) and bureaucrats (&quot;bugyōnin&quot;) as a way to put pressure on the warriors. But even this was ineffective as the hired hands had to negotiate with the warriors.

===&quot;Shugo&quot; and public lands (&quot;kokugaryo&quot;)===
A largely missing picture until recently, was the fate of public lands (&quot;kokugaryo&quot;) during the Muromachi period, and the role of the &quot;shugo&quot; lords in their encroachment on them. Public lands (kokugaryo) during the Heian period were distinguished from private lands of the estates (&quot;shōen&quot;), because the latter were immune from state taxation. Before the rise of private estates, the only kind of lands were public lands maintained under the old civil administration. With the rise of private estates called &quot;shōen&quot;, during the Heian period, public lands by no means disappeared: in details, the public lands differed very little from private estates. Both were owned by absentee proprietors. They differed only in terms of administration: private estates were directly managed by noble officials, whereas, public lands were managed by the civil governors (kokuga or kokushi) on behalf of the former.

By the Kamakura period, public lands were owned by different landowners as private holdings (&quot;chigyo&quot;). These landowners included noble houses, religious establishments and warriors. Whole areas of the Kantō and the northeast were held by warriors not in the capacity as estate managers, but as private holdings. Kantō provinces were granted to the Kamakura regime as private lands (&quot;chigyokoku&quot;). The Ashikaga regime inherited these lands, and decided, fatefully, to place &quot;shugo&quot; lords over them.

One of the main functions of the civil governor&#x27;s office (kokushi) was the oversight of criminal justice in the provinces, and the maintenance of the private holdings within the public lands (kokugaryo), but his function began to change with the advent of the Kamakura regime. With the appointment of &quot;shugo&quot; constables by Kamakura, all criminal jurisdiction within the provinces passed into his hands. But the civil governor (&quot;kokushi&quot;) remained as the key officer in the civil administration (&quot;ritsuryo&quot;), who made sure that rent from private holdings reached the absentee nobles and religious establishments (&quot;jisha honjo&quot;) in Kyoto and in Yamashiro province. His oversight did not include the private holdings of warriors, most usually concentrated in the Kantō and further north.

With the outbreak of the Nanboku-chō War, the civil administration (&quot;ritsuryo&quot;) began to break down rapidly, and &quot;shugo&quot; lords, who had a minor role in provincial governance during the Kamakura period, emerged to usurp the civil governor&#x27;s functions. This did not happen immediately in every province, but occurred without interruption until the &quot;shugo&quot; lords had become true governors over public lands. As they took over the oversight of private holdings within public lands, they established ties to many kinds of landowners: nobles, samurai of various kinds (kokujin, jizamurai), and to religious establishments. They enfeoffed their own followers on these lands, and reconfirmed the lands of existing samurai in exchange for military service, and established &quot;shugo&quot; contracts with the nobles with predictable results. Along with vassalage ties to local samurai (kokujin) on the estates, vassalage ties on public lands became a key resource that augmented the power of the &quot;shugo&quot; lords.

Furthermore, in 1346, ten years after the emergence of the Muromachi regime, the shōgun decentralized authority by giving the &quot;shugo&quot; the right to judge cases of crop stealing on the estates, and to make temporary assignments of land to deserving vassals taken from the imperialist forces. This was significant, insofar as traditional areas of Kamakura jurisdiction were &quot;given up&quot; by the Muromachi regime. Previously, all cases of crop stealing or land assignments were strictly under Kamakura administration. Also, about this time, the imperialist forces were suffering their worst defeats, opening up enemy land for confiscation and reassignment. By giving these new jurisdictions to the &quot;shugo&quot; lords, it further augmented their position as governors over their assigned provinces.

===Legitimation and limits to power===
In this dual capacity, the &quot;shugo&quot; lords had to compete with other landed samurai in the provinces for land they administered as governors, but did not personally own. Like the noble proprietors, a single &quot;shugo&quot; lord owned lands in widely dispersed areas in several provinces. His power was not built upon personal ownership of land like the territorial lords (daimyō) of the sixteenth century, but upon the loyalties of the local samurai through ties of vassalage. There was much greater coercive potential exercised by the territorial lords of the sixteenth century, because their ties of vassalage were based on their ownership of the lands around them: as owners they could dispense with the land as they saw fit, getting rid of recalcitrant vassals without much ado. In the fourteenth century, the &quot;shugo&quot; lords could not claim province wide ownership of territory: first, the concept of personal provincial ownership was as yet undeveloped; second, they never amassed large amounts of personal property, relying rather on using the traditional framework of estate lands and public lands to enfeoff their vassals. This is the central enigma of the fourteenth century: the fragmentation and dissolution of the estate system, and the disappearance of the civil administration coincided with the proliferation of private lands, but the external framework of the estate system (&quot;shōen&quot;) and the public lands system (kokugaryo), though devoid of content, still remained. Given the fragmentation, it was the intermediary ties of &quot;shugo&quot; vassalage, and the &quot;shugo&quot; role as provincial governor, that helped to integrate the disparate forces to some degree.

It becomes a wonder how the estate system survived at all given the depredations it suffered at the hands of the warriors. There were two reasons why it survived in the attenuated form described above: one, was the existence of the Muromachi regime that consistently upheld the estate system in the face of warrior incursions. As described earlier, Ashikaga Takauji tried to make sure that the limits set on the warriors by the half-tax measure was not exceeded, but he failed to circumvent arrangements like the &quot;shugo&quot; contract that really denuded the noble of his estate and its income. The half-tax measure itself did not protect the noble from the outright takeover of the estate at the hands of the samurai, even if the latter were required to hand over a portion to fulfill the half-tax law. In the end, it was the Muromachi administration that made sure that the samurai paid their portion of income to the nobles.

The other reason behind the survival of the estate system was connected to the legitimacy of the noble class. The rise of the warriors was not popular among the farmers living on the estates. The more gentle hand of the nobles was also the hand the people came to respect. To prevent outright disobedience and rebellion among the populace was one reason why both &quot;shugo&quot; lords and kokujin came to respect the outward form of the estate structure. To make their rulership legitimate in the eyes of the farmers, the warriors worked within the framework of the estate structure, even though this structure had been totally altered. A case can be made that the estate system, outside of Yamashiro province, had become eroded to such an extent that the nobles had little if any influence left in the provinces.

== Consolidation of power: 1360–1370 ==
In 1358 after the death of Takauji, the shogunate passed to his son Yoshiakira. Under his leadership, and that of the &quot;kanrei&quot; Hosokawa Yoriyuki&#x27;s, the regime succeeded in integrating the &quot;shugo&quot; lords in the 1360s and 1370s. &quot;Shugo&quot; branch families of the Ashikaga were now employed within the government bureaucracy. This happened due to the emergence of the &quot;kanrei&quot; council system which tied &quot;shugo&quot; lords firmly to the regime. Shogunal hegemony was now also stronger and this allowed them to discipline errant &quot;shugo&quot; lords. Furthermore, the effects of the half-tax decree of 1368; the court ranking system which tied the shogunate closer to the imperial court; and limitations to Muromachi authority in the Kyūshū and Kantō regions all served to push the consolidation of Muromachi power.

To mend relations after the Kannō Incident, Yoshiakira reorganized the regime by establishing the &quot;kanrei&quot; council system in 1362. This system was made up of two components, the &quot;kanrei&quot; office and the senior vassal council (&quot;jushin kaigi&quot;) over which the &quot;kanrei&quot; presided. The system involved the most powerful &quot;shugo&quot; families as participants in directly governing central and western Japan. Along with the shōgun, the &quot;kanrei&quot; council emerged to form the heart of the Muromachi regime to such an extent that historians have come to characterize this regime as the &quot;bakufu&quot;-&quot;shugo&quot; system.

===The &quot;kanrei&quot; council===
The very conflict that emerged with the Kannō Incident was caused due to the separation and clash between the military vassal institutions controlled by Takauji and the bureaucratic-judicial institutions controlled by Tadayoshi. With the emergence of the &quot;kanrei&quot; council system, the &quot;shugo&quot; lords who represented the military were tied firmly to the bureaucracy.

The job of the &quot;kanrei&quot; was to act as a spokesman between the Senior Vassal Council (&quot;jushin kaigi&quot;) and the shōgun. The &quot;kanrei&quot; also had the responsibility of looking over the bureaucratic elements of the regime on a daily basis, consulting and transmitting shogunal orders to the council and to the bureaucracy. In this system, regime policy was formulated in consultations between the council and the shōgun, though final decisions were made by the latter.

The &quot;kanrei&quot; was consistently selected from a hereditary group of three &quot;shugo&quot; families related to Takauji within four generations (Papinot 1972:27): the Hosokawa, the Hatakeyama and the Shiba. The three families took turns in filling the post. They were the highest ranking &quot;shugo&quot; families in the regime. In the beginning, the council was composed of the heads of these three &quot;shugo&quot; families along with four other heads of powerful &quot;shugo&quot; families: the Yamana, the Isshiki, the Akamatsu and the Kyōgoku. The latter two families were unrelated to the Ashikaga family. This trend of including unrelated &quot;shugo&quot; families into the council continued with the recruitment of the Ouchi, the Sasaki and the Toki families in the next few decades. This trend indicates that powerful &quot;shugo&quot; families, irrespective of kinship, were tied to the regime. Conflicts of interests between &quot;shugo&quot; lords and the shōgun was institutionalized by letting the &quot;shugo&quot; lords voice their opinions in discussions within the council.

The Board of Retainers (&quot;samuraidokoro&quot;) was also headed by a Senior Vassal Council member selected in the 14th century from among the Imagawa (who became a council member a little later), the Hosokawa, the Hatakeyama, the Shiba, and the Toki. The Board of Retainers had the responsibility over police functions and the execution of criminal justice in Kyoto. The office holder automatically became the &quot;shugo&quot; over Yamashiro province, the wealthiest and most densely populated in Japan, and had the responsibility of protecting the regime headquarters and Kyoto. By the beginning of the 15th century, the head of the Board of Retainers was chosen from among four &quot;shugo&quot; families: the Yamana, the Akamatsu, the Kyogoku, and the Isshiki.

&quot;Shugo&quot; participation in the Senior Vassal Council and in the Board of Retainers were important because it was through the use of these intermediary instruments whereby the Ashikaga shōguns were able to centralize the state under their direction. Kinship in the form of headship ties (&quot;soryo&quot;), looms large as a recruiting mechanism, here too, the &quot;shugo&quot; lords were mostly branch families of the Ashikaga. However, these kinship ties did little in the way of mediating between the semi-independent &quot;shugo&quot; lords and the regime. It was rather the effective participation of the &quot;shugo&quot; lords in governing through the &quot;kanrei&quot; council system which bound their interests more firmly than before to the regime.

===Ashikaga and &quot;shugo&quot; coalitions===
In 1362, the two most powerful &quot;shugo&quot; houses in the country, the Ouchi and the Yamana, submitted themselves to the Ashikaga regime on condition that the shōgun would not interfere with the internal affairs of their respective provinces (Grossberg 1981:25). Subsequently, the Yamana, who were related to the Ashikaga, and the Ouchi, who were not, began to play an increasingly important role in government affairs. However, within a few decades, both &quot;shugo&quot; houses became powerful enough to incur the wrath of the shōgun.

In 1366, the first &quot;kanrei&quot; office holder&#x27;s father, Shiba Takatsune who held real power over his thirteen-year-old son, and who engineered the placement of Shiba family members in key government offices was declared a traitor, because of his growing power and arrogance (he felt demeaned by accepting the &quot;kanrei&quot; post, so he had his son appointed instead). In the first show of force against an important &quot;shugo&quot; family, Yoshiakira ordered the Yamana, Sasaki, Yoshimi and the Toki &quot;shugo&quot; lords to attack the Shiba in the province of Echizen. The Shiba were defeated, and their territory in Echizen was redistributed. In 1367, following the ouster of the Shiba family, Hosokawa Yoriyuki was named as the successor to the post of &quot;kanrei&quot;: after the shōgun Yoshiakira&#x27;s death, Yoriyuki managed during the minority of the young shōgun Yoshimitsu to place the regime on a firmer foundation.

The use of &quot;shugo&quot; lords to attack one of their own colleagues in the 1366 points to the growing authority of the shōgun, compared to the &quot;shugo&quot; lords. Up until then, there was no true punitive mechanisms that the shōgun could use against his &quot;shugo&quot; lords. Pitting one &quot;shugo&quot; lord against another strengthened the shōgun&#x27;s hand.

In 1362, the last Southern Court offensive against Kyoto forced the Ashikaga to withdraw from the capital, but like many previous attempts, the imperialists had to eventually retreat in the face of a large counterattack without having accomplished anything. The exuberance that existed during the 1350s among the imperialist armies had faded. Resistance after this date became sporadic and completely defensive. Finally, in 1369, a year after the death of Emperor Go-Murakami, the stalwart imperialist general Kusunoki Masanori submitted to the regime. His capitulation ended the imperialist threat to the central provinces.

===Imperial legitimation===
In 1370, Imagawa Sadayo (Ryoshun) was appointed by the &quot;kanrei&quot; Yoriyuki and the Senior Vassal Council to bring down the last bastion of Southern Court resistance in Kyūshū. After a grueling twelve-year campaign, imperialist resistance collapsed with the defeat of the Kikuchi clan in 1381; and with the death of Shimazu Ujihisa in 1385, the last Kyūshū provincial domain declared its allegiance to the regime. With the fall of Kyūshū the whole of western Japan came under the rule of the Ashikaga regime. However, campaigns alone were inadequate to legitimize Ashikaga rule over the nobles.

After 1367, during the minority of the shōgun Yoshimitsu, the &quot;kanrei&quot; Hosokawa Yoriyuki became active in trying to legitimize the regime from the point of view of the nobles. He did this through a series of extremely conservative measures, gaining prestige among the nobles in Kyoto. He used an ancient court ranking system by having the young shōgun participate in it. He also associated the regime with the court much more closely than had any other previous warrior leader. By doing this, he tied the regime closer to the imperial court, thereby erasing the stigma of the ideology that fueled the Nanboku-chō conflict: Ashikaga Takauji was seen as a traitor fighting against the restoration of imperial power.

The court society survived such a long time because of its popularity among the different classes in Japanese society. On the estate level, farmers felt much closer to the nobles than towards the warriors. The waning power of the nobles notwithstanding, their influence went far beyond their actual power, because they possessed a legitimacy of tradition and the charisma of culture that the warriors did not possess. This was why Yoriyuki had the young shōgun participate in court ceremonies: the participation involved the highest military leader in a court ranking system that dated back several centuries, and had as its premise the primacy of the imperial line over everyone, including the warriors, who had to receive titles from the emperor. By participating in this court ranking ritual, the Ashikaga regime was sending a strong message to the entire society: that the legitimacy conferred by the court was still valid and still important. This participation bridged the tensions between the warrior regime and the court, and had the unintended effect of disseminating court culture among the warrior class. The warriors themselves were attracted to the culture of the nobles, and emulated the latter&#x27;s tastes such as being involved with constructing Zen rock gardens. The connection effected between the shōgun and the imperial court during the late 14th century, had the effect of broadening the legitimacy of the shōgun&#x27;s power.

The &quot;kanrei&quot; Yoriyuki promulgated the last half-tax decree (&quot;hanzei&quot;) in 1368. This decree tied noble interests to the regime: it outlawed the halving of lands owned by the imperial family (lands under the control of major temples) and those that were owned by the imperial regents (the Fujiwara). Exceptions included noble lands that were given full title by the previous shōgun, and estates managed by the samurai stewards (&quot;jitō&quot;). This decree was applicable to all estates nationwide, and led to deter further samurai incursions onto the estates, and to defend the interests of the nobles in the face of samurai incursions. Unlike the earlier half-tax decrees, this one was conservative, and its aim was to protect noble lands from division rather than to justify it.

The realities of samurai incursions that had already taken place could not be reversed. What was ideologically stated openly departed from what was actually taking place in the provinces. The incursions of the samurai and the &quot;shugo&quot; lords on the estates were severe despite the 1368 decree. And with the 15th century, this trend of land-grabbing became ever more pronounced. The Ashikaga shōguns were not able to stop the incursions on the estates. However ineffective, the 1368 decree recognized noble interests and were defended ideologically by a warrior regime, and in the process tied together the interests of both.

The direct rule of the Muromachi regime that emerged in the 1360s was limited geographically to the western and central provinces, unlike how the previous Kamakura regime was based in the Kantō region. Outside &quot;shugo&quot; lords (&quot;tozama&quot;) unrelated to the Ashikaga like the Takeda, Chiba, Yuki, Satake, Oyama, Utsunomiya, Shoni, Otomo, Aso, and the Shimazu families, all of whom were concentrated in or near the Kantō and Kyūshū regions, did not participate in the &quot;kanrei&quot; council system, and were semi-independent of the regime. They were tacitly recognized and given &quot;shugo&quot; titles by the Ashikaga, because of their predominant positions in areas that were not easily controlled from Kyoto.

===Kyūshū===
After the Kyūshū campaign that began in 1370, the Kyūshū deputy (&quot;tandai&quot;) became the representative of the Muromachi regime on that island. Imagawa Sadayo (Ryoshun) effectively prosecuted the campaign against the Southern Court forces and on Shimazu Ujihisa. Deputies like Sadayo were Muromachi representatives, even when they arrogated the full powers of vassalage to local samurai. For example, in 1377, a contract was signed between Sadayo and a samurai alliance (ikki) consisting of sixty-one local samurai. The contract stipulated that all disputes between alliance members would be taken to the Kyūshū deputy, while disputes between alliance members and the deputy himself would be taken to the Muromachi regime in Kyoto (Harrington 1985:87). The deputy united both the interests of the regime and of the local area. It was a precarious position because of the temptation to independence it presented. However, the Muromachi regime did not extend their direct control over the entirety of their domain, and so came to rely on appointees to influence the &quot;shugo&quot; lords and samurai.

===Kantō===
In the late 14th century, the Kantō region was dominated by powerful warrior families. Of these, the Uesugi were the most powerful. They were able to take advantage of the fighting that erupted between families in the region to advance their own interests. In 1368, the Utsunomiya family revolted against the Kamakura headquarters of the Muromachi regime, because they had lost their &quot;shugo&quot; posts to the Uesugi. The Uesugi was able to extend their influence by amassing &quot;shugo&quot; posts and by enfeoffing vassals at the expense of other families.

The Kamakura headquarters were where the regime could demand orders in the region. Increasingly, the headquarters became independent from the regime, and it then took care of regional disputes, regional taxation, and developed ties with &quot;shugo&quot; lords with minimal involvement from the regime in Kyoto—even though it was Kyoto&#x27;s &quot;de jure&quot; right to confirm fiefs and ratify &quot;shugo&quot; appointments.

==Centralization of power: 1379–1399==
One area of resistance after another fell to the Muromachi regime during the crucial decade of the 1360s. Powerful &quot;shugo&quot; lords like the Ouchi and the Yamana submitted themselves as semi-independent lords; Southern Court resistance became more futile as time passed. Militarily the regime was able to call upon the services of the &quot;shugo&quot; lords to attack one of their own colleagues in 1366, pointing to the increasing subordination of the &quot;shugo&quot; to shogunal control. Hand in hand with the creation of the &quot;kanrei&quot; council system and the increasing participation of the powerful &quot;shugo&quot; families in the &quot;bakufu&quot; bureaucracy as well as closer ties to the imperial court broadened the legitimate base of the regime. Development of the shogunal army, and the use of commercial/agrarian revenue and taxes by the regime also contributed to the stronger centralization of power by the shogun.

However, geographically, the Muromachi regime was limited in scope, delegating its jurisdiction of the Kantō and Kyūshū areas to regional representatives, holding more or less direct control only over the central and western provinces of Honshū. For fifty years after Yoshimitsu&#x27;s assumption of authority in 1379, the Muromachi regime entered its most powerful phase as the unrivaled government of Japan.

===The Ashikaga and the Imperial Court===
Under Yoshimitsu (f. 1379–1408) who took the reins of power after the dismissal of Yoriyuki as &quot;kanrei&quot;, saw the maturation of architectural and cultural forms that have since characterized Japanese culture. His close association with the imperial court and its culture, and his patronage of the new arts helped to disseminate this culture to the military aristocracy and the &quot;shugo&quot; lords. This connection between the shōgun and the imperial court brought added prestige to both institutions, and gave the shōgun an aura of civil legitimacy and culture that the previous Kamakura regime had lacked and that was denied to the warriors.

===Compulsory residence policy===
In the 1380s the &quot;kanrei&quot; council system was strengthened by Yoshimitsu when he persuaded the western and central &quot;shugo&quot; lords to take up residence in Kyoto. He even went to visit Ouchi Yoshihiro in 1389, and persuaded him to live in Kyoto during one of his so-called pilgrimage circuits (these circuits were used to display his power through the provinces in which he traveled). This policy enabled the shōgun to tighten his grip around the &quot;shugo&quot; lords. Permission to leave the capital city was rarely granted to the &quot;shugo&quot; lord, it was only granted after discussion in the Senior Vassal Council. Even when permission was granted in the case of provincial rebellion or Southern Court guerilla activity, suitable hostages were left behind in Kyoto. If the &quot;shugo&quot; lord left without permission, it was seen as tantamount to treason.

The Kantō and Kyūshū &quot;shugo&quot; were exempt from this order of compulsory residence in Kyoto. However, the Kamakura headquarters of the Muromachi regime instituted a similar policy in regards to the Kantō &quot;shugo&quot; lords, and made them establish mansions in Kamakura just as the western and central &quot;shugo&quot; lords made mansions in Kyoto. Mansion building in Kyoto became fashionable, and eventually included &quot;shugo&quot; lords like the Shimazu of Kyūshū, who decided to live in Kyoto even though he was not required to do so.

The &quot;shugo&quot; lords had little choice in the matter as they risk being branded a traitor. This residence policy saw the power of the &quot;shugo&quot; lords severely restricted as their freedom of movement was circumvented. Also by the second quarter of the 15th century, real power in the provinces moved away from the &quot;shugo&quot; lords and came to rest upon the deputy &quot;shugo&quot; (&quot;shugo-dai&quot;), and upon other independent samurai (&quot;kokujin&quot;) who resided in the provinces. Therefore, the policy was a long term disaster for the &quot;shugo&quot; lords. The hiring of deputy &quot;shugo&quot; was necessitated by the compulsory residential policy if the &quot;shugo&quot; lords were to maintain their power in the provinces. In the short term, hiring branch family members and samurai &quot;kokujin&quot; as deputy &quot;shugo&quot;, and using them as their own representatives in the provinces worked well; but in the long term, power passed from the hands of the &quot;shugo&quot; lords into the hands of those they hired.

===The shogunal army===
Yoshimitsu did not hesitate to use military force to reduce the &quot;shugo&quot; lords to obedience on the pretext that they had become too powerful. He assembled a new shogunal army (&quot;gobanshu&quot;) made up of five divisions totalling some 3,000 dependent on him. This force was a formidable array, particularly when they were augmented by contributions from other &quot;shugo&quot; lords. The shogunal army as a separate force connected the shōgun directly with his own vassals and was also made up of kokujin samurai. The shogunal army also served as a check on &quot;shugo&quot; forces. The first Ashikaga shōgun, Takauji, created ties with samurai stewards by enfeoffing them on estate lands. Throughout the early Muromachi period, this separate vassal hierarchy under the command of the shōgun was also an important check on &quot;shugo&quot; power.

The shogunal army had two components: the shogunal bodyguard (&quot;shin&#x27;eigun&quot;) which consisted of Ashikaga branch family members, &quot;shugo&quot; relatives and &quot;shugo&quot; branch family members, other sons and brothers of regime officials, and most importantly, powerful kokujin. Numbering (at most) 350 men, this group was a cohesive and loyal body, ready to defend the shōgun&#x27;s person at any cost. Surrounding this small band was a number of direct vassals of the shōgun tracing its origins back to 1336, when Takauji enfeoffed many samurai as house vassals who were probably used as a reserve army. Arnesen calculated that the number of direct vassals in the shogunal bodyguard was 60% to 70% the number of direct vassals enrolled under the later Hōjō clan of the 16th century. And if the Later Hōjō were able to field 50,000 troops in the Odawara campaign, the shogunal bodyguard of 350 could easily have mobilized their own vassals to come up with the 3,000 troops that took part in the Meitoku Rising of 1391. The creation of the shogunal bodyguard, and the central position of this group over other shogunal vassals is what differentiates the shogunal army of Yoshimitsu from the shogunal vassals of Takauji. A tighter organization and &quot;esprit de corps&quot; emerged with the new shogunal army.

===&quot;Shugo&quot; coalition as a force===
The shogunal army alone was not adequate to meet and defeat &quot;kanrei&quot; class &quot;shugo&quot; lords on the field of battle, but were perfectly suited to the kind of warfare Yoshimitsu practiced: pitting one &quot;shugo&quot; lord against a family member, and against other &quot;shugo&quot; lords. The new shogunal hegemony, that emerged under the previous shōgun, Yoshiakira, came to dominate the politics of Yoshimitsu. Shogunal prestige informally dictated that no single &quot;shugo&quot; lord should exceed a certain level of power without incurring the wrath of the shōgun. It was in the interest of the &quot;shugo&quot; lords themselves, that none of their own colleagues should become too powerful and dominant over the rest.

In pursuit of this policy in 1389 Yoshimitsu ordered Toki Yasuyuki, the &quot;shugo&quot; lord of the provinces of Mino, Ise and Owari to give up the latter province to a relative. Yasuyuki refused, and Yoshimitsu ordered the cousin of Yasuyuki, Toki Yorimasu, to attack him. After three years Yasuyuki was defeated, and the province of Mino was given to Yorimasu in 1391. To Yoshimitsu it did not matter whether the province that was given up was Mino or Owari as long as Toki Yasuyuki was shorn of some of his power in the central provinces.

Before the Meitoku Rising of 1391, the Yamana clan possessed 11 provinces in western and central Japan which made them the most powerful &quot;shugo&quot; family in the country. Yoshimitsu looked for an excuse to attack them; and when Yamana Mitsuyuki (who was &quot;shugo&quot; over the provinces of Izumo, Tanba, Hoki, and Oki) took possession of some estates belonging to the imperial family in Izumo, Yoshimitsu recalled the ex-&quot;kanrei&quot; Hosokawa Yoriyuki to plan a campaign against Mitsuyuki. The Yamana &quot;shugo&quot; lords Mitsuyuki and Ujikiyo attacked Kyoto, but were severely defeated by the shogunal army in concert with the forces of Ouchi Yoshihiro. The other &quot;shugo&quot; contingents that made up the shōgun&#x27;s forces numbered no more than 300 horsemen each. After the campaign, the Yamana were assigned only two provinces, Tajima and Hoki, Ujikiyo was killed in battle while Mitsuyuki died through assassination in 1395.

This pitting of one &quot;shugo&quot; lord against another reached a head in 1399. Ironically, this time the target was Ouchi Yoshihiro, who had served the regime well in the campaign against the Yamana. Yoshihiro was ordered to attack the Shoni in 1397 which he did, losing his brother in the process. He later learned of the Byzantine duplicity of Yoshimitsu: Shoni was also ordered to attack the Ouchi. Angered by this duplicity, and fearing for his life when the shōgun summoned him to Kyoto, he opted to disobey, which led him to be declared an enemy of the regime. At the battle of Sakai, Yoshimitsu along with the forces of five &quot;shugo&quot; lords, the Hosokawa, Akamatsu, Kyogoku, Shiba, and the Hatakeyama, overwhelmed Yoshihiro&#x27;s defensive works by setting fire to the city. The allied force led by Yoshimitsu numbered 30,000 warriors against Ouchi&#x27;s 5,000; Yoshihiro was overwhelmed in battle and he committed suicide.

As each of these previous examples illustrate, shogunal hegemony became very effective. It was used to divide the &quot;shugo&quot; lords by making them attack and destroy colleagues. Shogunal hegemony would not have succeeded without the cooperation of the &quot;shugo&quot; lords in uniting their forces with the shogunal army. However, without finances to support the shogunal army and other expenses of the regime, this coercive policy would have been unthinkable.

===Sources of revenue===
Kyoto in the late 14th and 15th centuries was a brilliant center for economic activity. With the compulsory residential policy that emerged under the shōgun Yoshimitsu, &quot;shugo&quot; lords with their vassals and servants added to the distinguished population of the city that included nobles, the imperial court and the Muromachi government. This translated into a vast market for a variety of goods and services that spurred the economic growth of the city. This growth was important to both the shōgun and &quot;shugo&quot; lords who lived in the capital as they tapped the wealth of the moneylenders (&quot;sakaya-doso&quot;) on a consistent basis, the shōgun even employed them as tax collectors in the city. What made the Muromachi regime so different from the previous Kamakura regime was the basis for its income; much of its revenue came from commercial taxes in addition to its landed base.

The Board of Administration (&quot;mandokoro&quot;) was used as a clearing house for matters concerning the revenue of the Muromachi regime. It was the chief bureaucratic organ that connected the regime to various commercial groups in the city for purposes of taxation. In 1393, the regime legalized its right to tax moneylenders directly. Commercial taxes assessed in Kyoto became the foundation for the new urban based Muromachi regime, and decisively changed the nature of the regime from one solely based on landed estates to a regime partly based on commerce.

Traditional agrarian based revenue came from three major sources: from shogunal estates, from shogunal vassals, and from taxes assessed against the &quot;shugo&quot; lords. The landed base of the Ashikaga shōguns was paltry compared to their successors, the Tokugawa; however, there were approximately 200 shogunal estates (&quot;goryosho&quot;) scattered between Kyoto and the Kantō region, and revenue extracted from these estates were significant. Moreover, the connection between the shogunal estates and the shogunal army was decisive: some of the men who served in the army were also managers over the shōgun&#x27;s personal estates. Furthermore, many local samurai paid land taxes directly to the regime (&quot;kyosai&quot;) as one of the privileges they enjoyed as house vassals (&quot;gokenin&quot;), being immunized from &quot;shugo&quot; tax collectors in the process. In addition, &quot;shugo&quot; lords were taxed directly (&quot;shugo shussen&quot;) according to how many provinces they administered. This was assessed by the regime whenever there were buildings to be built or fixed, and when the shōgun needed cash for various projects.

The sources of revenue for the Muromachi regime were varied to a much greater extent than it was under the Kamakura regime due to the emerging market economy in Kyoto and Yamashiro province. It came in novel form as commercial revenue extracted from the moneylenders, a tax was assessed once the power structure of the Muromachi bureaucracy had effectively taken the city of Kyoto.

==Administration==
Serious fighting between the two sides raged on for nearly 30 years before Ashikaga Takauji and his supporters gained the upper hand. He relied on three main policies to accomplish the task of assembling power:

# Strengthening vassalage ties to samurai housemen (&quot;gokenin&quot;)
# The use of &quot;shugo&quot; lords as &quot;bakufu&quot; governors and vassals in the provinces
# The half-tax policy of dividing estate lands

Both the vassalage ties with the samurai and control over &quot;shugo&quot; lords were established after the regime had solidified in the 1350s. These two hierarchies were the most important connections in determining the shōgun&#x27;s power.

The half-tax policy recognized the legality of samurai incursions on estate lands (&quot;shōen&quot;), but at the same time guaranteed the survival of the estate system.

=== Comparison with the Kamakura ===
In the Kamakura period, the vassalage ties between the samurai stewards (&quot;jitō&quot;) and the Kamakura regime (1185–1333) were intermediary, because they placed the jitō in a position where he was answerable directly to both the shōgun in Kamakura and the court nobles in Kyoto. The jitō can also be a shogunal houseman (&quot;gokenin&quot;) and a trusted vassal, and given the management of an estate that legally belonged to a noble in Kyoto. He was answerable to the shōgun in the form of military service and dues, but as a manager of an estate owned by a noble, he had to pay rent to the latter.

The stability of the Kamakura system rested upon the regime&#x27;s guarantee of stewardship rights (&quot;jito shiki&quot;) to the dominant warriors, and of rent and land ownership rights to the noble proprietor. Through the vassalage ties to the jitō, the new warrior regime was grafted onto the older estate system, and in the process bridged the conflicting tendencies that existed between warriors and nobles. This Kamakura tradition was prestigious and it set the precedent for what followed in the Muromachi period.

Also during the Kamakura, Yoritomo and the Hōjō Regents were only concerned about controlling their own gokenin, consciously limiting themselves to hearing the land dispute cases of their own vassals and rewarding stewardship rights to their followers, letting other disputes from other groups to be taken care of by the civil administration. This precedent was followed by the Ashikaga shōguns as they protected the interests of their vassals against the incursions of the &quot;shugo&quot; lords throughout the Muromachi period.

The half-tax policy led the &quot;shugo&quot; to have more power as lords of the provinces and it divided estate lands which multiplied the number of fiefs owned by samurai warriors. This led to warrior interests predominating, but also preserved noble interests. In helping to preserve the estate system, the half-tax measure was a policy that still managed to connect the rights of the noble with those of the warrior.

The half-tax policy began as an emergency tax designated for military rations (&quot;hyororyosho&quot;) collected during wartime: half the income from a particular temple, shrine and estate lands in the provinces of Mino, Ōmi and Owari would be taken to support armies of the Muromachi regime. Increasingly, this was reinterpreted and changed by Takauji as the permanent acquisition of half of the land was now for the purpose of enfeoffing vassals.

===Stronger vassalage ties===
When the Nanboku-chō conflict broke out, vassalage ties became stronger between the shōgun and his vassals as a result of the need for military action against rivals. During the relatively peaceful Kamakura period, military skills were not as important as during the outbreak of civil war. Ties had to be strengthened or there was a risk of losing a potential warrior to the emerging &quot;shugo&quot; lords loyal to the Ashikaga clan or worst, by rival imperialist generals. These vassalage ties were used to bridge a potential conflict through the recruitment of warriors.

Several events depict the changing atmosphere of these vassalage ties. The Kobayakawa family became loyal vassals when they defended Ashikaga interests in Aki Province after Takauji retreated to Kyūshū in 1336. The Mōri clan became vassals of Takauji in 1336, and served under Kō Moroyasu until the outbreak of the Kannō Incident. In the 1350s, the Mori sided with the enemies of Takauji (Tadayoshi and his adopted son Tadafuyu) and not until the 1360s were they back again as vassals of the shōgun. Vassalage ties to the Kawashima clan and other warrior families near Kyoto were established by Takauji in the summer of 1336 in the latter&#x27;s drive to retake the capital. The Kawashima exchanged military service for stewardship rights (&quot;jito shiki&quot;) to over half of Kawashima Estate, leaving the other half in possession of the noble proprietor in the form of rent.

== Legacy ==
Since the 19th century the Emperors of the Southern Imperial Court have been considered the legitimate Emperors of Japan. Factors contributing to their legitimacy were the Southern Court&#x27;s control of the Japanese imperial regalia, and Kitabatake Chikafusa&#x27;s work &quot;Jinnō Shōtōki&quot;, which legitimized the South&#x27;s imperial court despite their defeat.

The consequences of events in this period continue to be influential in modern Japan&#x27;s conventional view of the &quot;Tennō Seika&quot; (Emperor system). Under the influence of State Shinto, an Imperial decree dated March 3, 1911 established that the legitimate reigning monarchs of this period were the Southern Court. After World War II, a series of pretenders, starting with Kumazawa Hiromichi, claimed descent from the Southern Court and challenged the legitimacy of the modern imperial line, which is descended from the Northern Court.

<doc id="356765" wikidata="Q637073" url="?curid=356765" title="Night of the Living Dead (song)">
<text>&quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; is the fourth single by the horror punk band the Misfits. It was released on October 31, 1979, on singer Glenn Danzig&#x27;s label Plan 9 Records. 2,000 copies of the single were pressed on black 7&quot; vinyl. The night of its release the band performed at Irving Plaza in New York City and sold the single at the door.

&quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; is titled after the 1968 horror film of the same name, and the song&#x27;s lyrics address the zombie plot of the film: &quot;You think you&#x27;re a zombie, you think it&#x27;s a scene/from some monster magazine/Open your eyes too late/This ain&#x27;t no fantasy boy&quot;. A re-recording of the song was later included on the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Walk Among Us&quot;. &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; shares its title with a 1968 war film. &quot;Rat Fink&quot; is a cover of a song by Allan Sherman from his 1963 album &quot;My Son, the Nut&quot;, which itself is a parody of &quot;Rag Mop&quot;. It was the only cover song that the Misfits recorded during their early era, though it was credited on the single itself, and on later releases, to Danzig.

==Re-releases and other versions==
Different versions of all three tracks appeared on compilation albums years after the original single went out of print. An alternate version of &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; was released on &quot;Legacy of Brutality&quot; in 1985, with overdubbed guitar and bass tracks recorded by Danzig. Different versions of &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; and &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; appeared on &quot;Misfits&quot; the following year, while &quot;Rat Fink&quot; appeared on &quot;Collection II&quot; in 1995. All three songs appeared, in all of their different versions and recordings, in The Misfits box set in 1996.

==Cover versions==
&quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; was covered by 88 Fingers Louie on their 1995 album &quot;Behind Bars&quot;, and by the Troublemakers on the 2000 Misfits tribute album &quot;Hell on Earth&quot;. &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; was covered by Therapy? on the 1997 tribute album &quot;Violent World&quot;, by The Robots on &quot;Hell on Earth&quot;, by Bratmobile on their &quot;The Real Janelle&quot; EP, by Sloppy Seconds as a 1987 single featuring Bobby Steele, and by No Fun At All on their 1997 EP &quot;And Now For Something Completely Different&quot;.

<text>Öland County, or &quot;Ölands län&quot;, was a county of Sweden, between 1819 and 1826. It consisted of the island of Öland, designating the historical province of Öland as its own county. A Governor resided briefly at Borgholm, but the island is today part of the Kalmar County. 

Some important historical sites in Öland County are: Borgholm Castle, Halltorps Estate, Eketorp fortress and the Gettlinge Gravefield. Much of Öland County&#x27;s present day landscape known as the Stora Alvaret has been designated as a World Heritage Site.

<text>Stephen Adrian Lawrence (13September 1974 – 22April 1993) was an 18-year-old black British citizen from Plumstead, southeast London, who was murdered in a racially motivated attack while waiting for a bus on Well Hall Road, Eltham, on the evening of 22April 1993. The case became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot;: its fallout included changes of attitudes on racism and the police, and to the law and police practice. It also led to the partial revocation of the rule against double jeopardy. Two of the perpetrators were convicted of murder on 3January 2012.

After the initial investigation, five suspects were arrested but not charged; a private prosecution subsequently initiated by Lawrence&#x27;s family failed to secure convictions for any of the accused. It was suggested during the investigation that Lawrence was killed because he was black, and that the handling of the case by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) and Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was affected by issues of race. A 1998 public inquiry, headed by Sir William Macpherson, concluded that the original MPS investigation was incompetent and that the force was institutionally racist. It also recommended that the double jeopardy rule should be repealed in murder cases to allow a retrial upon new and compelling evidence: this was effected in 2005 upon enactment of the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The publication in 1999 of the resulting Macpherson Report has been called &quot;one of the most important moments in the modern history of criminal justice in Britain&quot;. Jack Straw said that ordering the inquiry was the most important decision he made during his tenure as home secretary from 1997 to 2001. In 2010, the Lawrence case was said to be &quot;one of the highest-profile unsolved racially motivated murders&quot;.

On 18May 2011, after a further review, it was announced that two of the original suspects, Gary Dobson and David Norris, were to stand trial for the murder in the light of new evidence. At the same time it was disclosed that Dobson&#x27;s original acquittal had been quashed by the Court of Appeal, allowing a retrial to take place. Such an appeal had only become possible following the 2005 change in the law, although Dobson was not the first person to be retried for murder as a result. On 3January 2012, Dobson and Norris were found guilty of Lawrence&#x27;s murder; the pair were juveniles at the time of the crime and were sentenced to detention at Her Majesty&#x27;s pleasure, equivalent to a life sentence for an adult, with minimum terms of 15 years 2 months and 14 years 3 months respectively for what the judge described as a &quot;terrible and evil crime&quot;.

In the years after Dobson and Norris were sentenced, the case regained prominence when concerns of corrupt police conduct during the original case handling surfaced in the media. Such claims had surfaced before, and been investigated in 2007, but were reignited in 2013 when a former undercover police officer stated in an interview that, at the time, he had been pressured to find ways to &quot;smear&quot; and discredit the victim&#x27;s family, in order to mute and deter public campaigning for better police responses to the case. Although further inquiries in 2012 by both Scotland Yard and the Independent Police Complaints Commission had ruled that there was no basis for further investigation, Home Secretary Theresa May ordered an independent inquiry by a prominent QC into undercover policing and corruption, which was described as &quot;devastating&quot; when published in 2014. An inquiry into whether members of the police force shielded the alleged killers was set up in October 2009.

== Stephen Lawrence ==
Stephen Adrian Lawrence was born in Greenwich District Hospital on 13September 1974 to Jamaican parents who had emigrated to the UK in the 1960s. His father was Neville Lawrence, then a carpenter, and his mother was Doreen, then a special needs teacher. Brought up in Plumstead, South-East London, he was the eldest of three children, the others being Stuart (born 1976) and Georgina (born 1982).

During his teenage years, Lawrence excelled in running, competing for the local Cambridge Harriers athletics club, and appeared as an extra in Denzel Washington&#x27;s film &quot;For Queen and Country&quot;. At the time of his murder, he was studying technology and physics at the Blackheath Bluecoat School and English language and literature at Woolwich College, and was hoping to become an architect.

== Attack ==
Lawrence had spent the day of 22April 1993 at Blackheath Bluecoat School. After school, he visited shops in Lewisham, then travelled by bus to an uncle&#x27;s house in Grove Park. He was joined there by his friend Duwayne Brooks, and they played video games until leaving at around 10:00pm. After realising that the 286 bus on which they were travelling would get them home late, they decided to change for either bus route 161 or bus route 122 on Well Hall Road.

Lawrence and Brooks arrived at the bus stop on Well Hall Road at 10:25pm. Lawrence walked along Well Hall Road to the junction of Dickson Road to see if he could see a bus coming. Brooks was still on Well Hall Road, between Dickson Road and the roundabout with Rochester Way and Westhorne Avenue.

Brooks saw a group of six white youths crossing Rochester Way on the opposite side of the street near the area of the zebra crossing and moving towards them. At or just after 10:38 pm, he called out to ask whether Lawrence saw the bus coming. Brooks claimed that he heard one of Lawrence&#x27;s assailants saying a racial slur as they all quickly crossed the road and &quot;engulfed&quot; Lawrence.

The six aggressors forced Lawrence down to the ground, then stabbed him to a depth of about on both sides of the front of his body, in the right collarbone and left shoulder. Both wounds severed axillary arteries before penetrating a lung. Lawrence lost all feeling in his right arm and his breathing was constricted, while he was losing blood from four major blood vessels. Brooks began running, and shouted for Lawrence to run to escape with him. While the attackers disappeared down Dickson Road, Brooks and Lawrence ran in the direction of Shooters Hill. Lawrence collapsed after running ; he bled to death soon afterwards. The pathologist recorded that Lawrence managing to run this distance with a partially collapsed lung was &quot;a testimony to his physical fitness&quot;.

Brooks ran to call an ambulance while an off-duty police officer stopped his car and covered Lawrence with a blanket. Lawrence was taken to Brook General Hospital by 11:05 pm, but he was already dead.

== Trials ==
=== Witnesses ===
All three witnesses at the bus stop at the time of the attack said in their statements that the attack was sudden and short, although none were later able to identify the suspects. In the days following Lawrence&#x27;s murder, several residents came forward to provide names of suspects and an anonymous note was left on a police car windscreen and in a telephone box naming a local gang as the five main suspects. The suspects were Gary Dobson, brothers Neil and Jamie Acourt, Luke Knight, and David Norris. In February 1999, officers investigating the handling of the initial inquiry revealed that a woman who might have been a vital witness had telephoned detectives three times within the first few days after the killing, and appealed for her to contact them again.

The five suspects were previously involved in racist knife attacks around the Eltham area. Four weeks before Lawrence&#x27;s death, Dobson and Neil Acourt were involved in a racist attack on a black teenager, Kevin London, whom they verbally abused and attempted to stab. Neil&#x27;s brother Jamie was accused of stabbing teenagers Darren Witham in May 1992 and Darren Giles in 1994, causing Giles to suffer a cardiac arrest. The stabbings of victims Gurdeep Bhangal and Stacey Benefield, which both occurred in March 1993, in Eltham, were also linked to Neil and Jamie Acourt, David Norris and Gary Dobson.

=== Initial investigations, arrests and prosecutions ===
Within three days of the crime, prime suspects had been identified. No arrests were made, however, until over two weeks after the murder. The police also did not investigate the suspects&#x27; houses for four days. Detective Superintendent Brian Weeden, the officer who had been leading the murder investigation from its third day, and who led the murder squad for 14 months, explained to the McPherson inquiry in 1998 that part of the reason no arrests had taken place by the fourth day after the killing (Monday 26April) was that he had not known the law allowed arrest upon reasonable suspicion – a basic point of criminal law.

On 7May 1993, the Acourt brothers and Dobson were arrested. Norris turned himself in to police and was likewise arrested three days later. Knight was arrested on 3June. Neil Acourt, picked out at an identity parade, and Luke Knight were charged with murder on 13May and 23June 1993 respectively, but the charges were dropped on 29July 1993, the Crown Prosecution Service citing insufficient evidence.

An internal review was opened in August 1993 by the Metropolitan Police. On 16April 1994, the Crown Prosecution Service stated they did not have sufficient evidence for murder charges against anyone else, despite a belief by the Lawrence family that new evidence had been found. The main issue was with the identification evidence by Brooks, which was seen as both tainted by procedural irregularities, and not strong enough under case law: this view was borne out by the later private prosecution.

=== Private prosecution ===
In September 1994, Lawrence&#x27;s family initiated a private prosecution against the initial two suspects and three others: Jamie Acourt, Gary Dobson and David Norris. The family were not entitled to legal aid and a fighting fund was established to pay for the analysis of forensic evidence and the cost of tracing and re-interviewing witnesses. The family were represented by leading counsel Michael Mansfield QC, assisted by Tanoo Mylvaganam and Annie Dixon who all worked &quot;pro bono&quot;. The charges against Acourt and Norris were dropped before the trial for lack of evidence. On 23April 1996, the three remaining suspects were acquitted of murder by a jury at the Central Criminal Court, after the trial judge, the Honourable Mr Justice Curtis, ruled that the identification evidence given by Duwayne Brooks was unreliable. The costs of the prosecution were paid out of the public purse.

The Macpherson report endorsed the judgement, stating that &quot;Mr Justice Curtis could [have] properly reach[ed] only one conclusion&quot; and that &quot;[t]here simply was no satisfactory evidence available&quot;.

=== Subsequent events (1994–2010) ===

An inquest into the death of Lawrence was held in February 1997. The five suspects refused to answer any questions, claiming privilege against self-incrimination. The inquest concluded on 13February 1997, with the jury returning a verdict after 30 minutes&#x27; deliberation of unlawful killing &quot;in a completely unprovoked racist attack by five white youths&quot;; this finding went beyond the bounds of their instructions. On 14 February 1997, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper labelled all five suspects &quot;murderers&quot;. The headline read, &quot;Murderers: The Mail accuses these men of killing. If we are wrong, let them sue us.&quot; Underneath this headline appeared pictures of the five suspects: Dobson, Neil and Jamie Acourt, Knight, and Norris. None of the men ever sued for defamation and strong public opinions rose against the accused and the police who handled the case.

In July 1997 an inquiry was ordered by the home secretary to identify matters related to the killing, known as the Macpherson Report, which was completed in February 1999 &quot;(see below)&quot;. In 2002, David Norris and Neil Acourt were convicted and jailed for racially aggravated harassment after an incident involving a plain-clothes black police officer.

In 2005 the law was changed. As part of the findings on the Lawrence case, the Macpherson Report had recommended that the rule against double jeopardy (the common law rule that, once acquitted, an accused person could not be tried a second time for the same crime) should be repealed in murder cases, and that it should be possible to subject an acquitted murder suspect to a second trial if &quot;fresh and viable&quot; new evidence later came to light. The Law Commission later added its support to this in its report &quot;Double Jeopardy and Prosecution Appeals&quot; (2001). A parallel report into the criminal justice system by Lord Justice Auld, a former senior presiding judge for England and Wales, had also commenced in 1999 and was published as the Auld Report 6 months after the Law Commission report. It opined that the Law Commission had been unduly cautious by limiting the scope to murder and that &quot;the exceptions should [...] extend to other grave offences punishable with life and/or long terms of imprisonment as Parliament might specify.&quot;

These recommendations were implemented within the Criminal Justice Act 2003, and this provision came into force in April 2005. It opened murder and certain other serious crimes (including manslaughter, kidnapping, rape, armed robbery, and some drug crimes) to a second prosecution, regardless of when committed, with two conditions – the retrial must be approved by the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the Court of Appeal must agree to quash the original acquittal because of new and compelling evidence.

On 27July 2006, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; repeated its &quot;Murderers&quot; front page. In July 2010, &quot;The Independent&quot; described the Lawrence killing – despite it having happened more than 17 years previously – as &quot;one of the highest-profile unsolved racially motivated murders&quot;.

=== Cold case review and new evidence ===
In June 2006, a cold case review commenced, involving a full re-examination of the forensic evidence. Initially this was held in secrecy and not publicised; however, in November 2007, police confirmed they were investigating new scientific evidence. The re-examination was led by forensic scientist Angela Gallop.

The most important of the new evidence comprised:

* A microscopic stain of Lawrence&#x27;s blood in Dobson&#x27;s jacket. It had dried into the fibres and its tiny size implied this had happened very quickly. The forensic analysis concluded it had not been transferred there from elsewhere as dried blood, or perhaps later soaked into the fabric, but was deposited fresh, and would have dried almost immediately after being deposited due to its microscopic size.
* Fibres from Lawrence&#x27;s clothing, and hairs with a 99.9% chance of coming from Lawrence, found on Norris and Dobson&#x27;s clothes from the time or in the evidence bag holding them.

The police unit manager involved in the matter commented that the new evidence was only found because of scientific developments and developments in forensic approaches that had taken place since 1996 which allowed microscopic blood stains and hair fragments to be analysed for DNA and other microscopic evidence to be found and used forensically.

=== 2011–2012 trial ===
Gary Dobson and David Norris were arrested and charged without publicity on 8 September 2010 and on 23October 2010 the Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, applied to the Court of Appeal for Dobson&#x27;s original acquittal to be quashed. Dobson was in prison at the time for drug dealing. Norris had not been previously acquitted, so no application was necessary in his case. For legal reasons, to protect the investigation and ensure a fair hearing, reporting restrictions were put in place at the commencement of these proceedings; the arrests and subsequent developments were not publicly reported at the time.

Dobson&#x27;s acquittal was quashed following a two-day hearing on 11 and 12April 2011, enabling his retrial. On 18May 2011, the Court of Appeal handed down its judgment and the reporting restrictions were partially lifted. It was announced by the Crown Prosecution Service that the two would face trial for Lawrence&#x27;s murder in light of &quot;new and substantial evidence&quot;. The judgment of the court stated that &quot;[i]f reliable, the new scientific evidence would place Dobson in very close proximity indeed to Stephen Lawrence at the moment of and in the immediate aftermath of the attack, proximity, moreover, for which no innocent explanation can be discerned&quot;. The ruling also emphasised that this was to be &quot;a new trial of a defendant who, we repeat, is presumed in law to be innocent,&quot; and suggested a cautious and fact-based reporting style to avoid contempt of court or risk of prejudice to the future trial.

A jury was selected on 14November 2011, and the trial, presided over by Mr Justice Treacy, began the next day at the Central Criminal Court. With the prosecution led by Mark Ellison QC, the case centred on the new forensic evidence and whether it demonstrated the defendant&#x27;s involvement in the murder, or was the result of later contamination due to police handling. The spot of blood was so small that it would have dried almost instantly, leading to the conclusion that it was transferred at the crime scene. On 3 January 2012, after the jury had deliberated for just over 8 hours, Dobson and Norris were found guilty of Lawrence&#x27;s murder. The two were sentenced on 4 January 2012 to detention at Her Majesty&#x27;s Pleasure, equivalent to a life sentence for an adult, with minimum terms of 15 years and 2 months for Dobson and 14 years and 3 months for Norris. Time spent on remand by Dobson was not deducted from his minimum term to ensure his existing sentence for drug-related offences was served. The judge&#x27;s sentencing remarks were later published in full online.

The judge stated that the sentences reflected that Dobson and Norris were juveniles (Dobson 17, and Norris 16) at the time of the offence, which took place before the Criminal Justice Act 2003; the starting point for the minimum term was therefore 12 years. The judge acknowledged this was &quot;lower than some might expect&quot;. A similar crime committed in 2011 as an adult would have justified a minimum sentence of 30 years.

=== Immediate aftermath of trial ===
Following the 2012 convictions, Paul Dacre, &quot;Daily Mail&quot; editor since 1992, issued a comment on his 1997 headline decision.
Writing in the February 2012 edition of the &quot;Socialist Review&quot;, Brian Richardson suggested that Dacre was overselling his involvement in what had finally been achieved, stating:
===Appeals===
On 5 January 2012, it was reported that the Attorney General was reviewing the minimum terms at the request of a member of the public, to determine whether he believed them to be &quot;unduly lenient&quot;, and if so whether to apply to the Court of Appeal for an increase in the minimum terms. Juvenile minimum life sentences in a 2000 review (i.e. before the 2003 act passed into law) varied from a &quot;most common&quot; minimum of 10 years to a maximum of 20, placing Dobson and Norris in the middle of that range. On 1 February 2012, the Attorney General announced that he would not be referring the sentences to the Court of Appeal, as he believed that &quot;the minimum terms [were] ... within the appropriate range of sentences&quot;.

On 30January 2012, it emerged that Norris and Dobson were seeking leave from the Court of Appeal to appeal against their convictions.

On 23August 2012, it was reported that Norris and Dobson had lost the first round of their appeal. On 15March 2013, it was announced that Dobson had dropped his appeal against his murder conviction. Shortly after Norris was denied leave to appeal.

On 18May 2022, it was reported that David Norris&#x27;s request to be moved to an open prison in advance of his possible release was denied.

===Further developments===
In 2016 police released an enhanced image from a CCTV camera, showing the face of a witness they have not been able to identify.

== Other inquiries and investigations ==
=== The Macpherson Inquiry ===
On 31July 1997, the home secretary, Jack Straw, ordered a public inquiry, to be conducted by Sir William Macpherson and officially titled &quot;The Inquiry Into The Matters Arising From The Death of Stephen Lawrence&quot;, and published as &quot;The Macpherson report&quot;. Its report, produced in February 1999, estimated that it had taken &quot;more than 100,000 pages of reports, statements, and other written or printed documents&quot; and concluded that the original Metropolitan Police Service investigation had been incompetent and that officers had committed fundamental errors, including failing to give first aid when they reached the scene, failing to follow obvious leads during their investigation, and failing to arrest suspects. The report found that there had been a failure of leadership by senior MPS officers and that recommendations of the 1981 Scarman Report, compiled following race-related riots in Brixton and Toxteth, had been ignored.

Detective Superintendent Brian Weeden said during the inquiry that mistakes had been made in the murder investigation, including his own ignorance that he could have arrested the suspects four days after the killing simply on reasonable suspicion, a basic point of criminal law.

The report also found that the Metropolitan Police was institutionally racist. A total of 70 recommendations for reform, covering both policing and criminal law, were made. These proposals included abolishing the double jeopardy rule and criminalising racist statements made in private. Macpherson also called for reform in the British Civil Service, local governments, the National Health Service, schools, and the judicial system, to address issues of institutional racism.

The report was criticised in an October 2000 article in &quot;The Times&quot; by Michael Gove (later an MP and cabinet minister), who wrote, &quot;The tendentious reasoning and illiberal recommendations of that document have been brilliantly anatomised by the ethical socialists Norman Dennis and George Erdos and the Kurdish academic Ahmed al-Shahi in the Civitas pamphlet &quot;Racist Murder and Pressure Group Politics&quot;.&quot; The pamphlet referred to by Gove is a publication by the think tank Civitas, which criticised the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry, its procedures, its findings and its reception, as well as broadly exploring what it called &quot;The fanatical mindset... of the militant anti-racist&quot; with references to Malcolm X among others.

The government gave the cost of the inquiry as £4.2 million, of which £3.5 million was paid by the Metropolitan Police.

===Public complaints about mishandling of case===
In 1997, Lawrence&#x27;s family registered a formal complaint with the Police Complaints Authority (PCA), which in 1999 exonerated the officers who had worked on the case of allegations of racism. Only one officer, Detective Inspector Ben Bullock, was ordered to face disciplinary charges for neglect of duty. Bullock, who was second in command of the investigation, was later found guilty of failure to properly brief officers and failure to fully investigate an anonymous letter sent to police, but he was acquitted of 11 other charges. Four other officers who would have been charged as a result of the inquiry retired before it concluded.

Bullock retired the day after his punishment was announced, so that it amounted to a caution. Neville Lawrence, Stephen&#x27;s father, criticised the punishment, saying that Bullock was &quot;guilty on all counts.&quot; However, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Federation stated that Bullock had been &quot;largely vindicated&quot; in the proceedings.

On 10 March 2006, the Metropolitan Police Service announced that it would pay Duwayne Brooks £100,000 as compensation for how police handled his complaints about their actions toward him after the murder, characterized as &quot;racist stereotyping&quot; of him as a hostile young black man, according to a statement from Brooks&#x27; solicitors firm.

=== Concerns and inquiries of alleged police corruption and undercover officer conduct ===
==== Investigation into police corruption (2006) ====
On 25July 2006, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) announced that it had asked the Metropolitan Police to look into alleged claims of police corruption that may have helped hide the killers of Lawrence.

A BBC investigation alleged that the murder inquiry&#x27;s Det. Sgt. John Davidson had taken money from known drug smuggler Clifford Norris, the father of David Norris, a chief suspect in the investigation. Neil Putnam, a former corrupt police detective turned whistleblower, told a BBC investigation that Clifford Norris was paying Davidson to obstruct the case and to protect the suspects. &quot;Davidson told me that he was looking after Norris and that to me meant that he was protecting him, protecting his family against arrest and any conviction,&quot; Putnam said. Davidson denied any such corruption.

The Metropolitan Police Service announced that it was to open up a special incident room to field calls from the public, following the BBC documentary &quot;The Boys Who Killed Stephen Lawrence&quot;. The Independent Police Complaints Commission later stated that the claims made in the programme were unfounded.
On 17December 2009, Independent Police Complaints Commission investigators and officers from the Metropolitan Police&#x27;s directorate of professional standards arrested a former police constable and a serving member of Metropolitan Police staff on suspicion of attempting to pervert the course of justice by allegedly withholding evidence from the original murder inquiry, the Kent investigation and the Macpherson inquiry. Dr Richard Stone, who sat on the Macpherson inquiry, commented that the panel had felt that there was &quot;a large amount of information that the police were either not processing or were suppressing&quot; and &quot;a strong smell of corruption&quot;. Baroness Ros Howells, patron of the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, agreed: &quot;Lots of people said they gave the police evidence which was never produced.&quot; On 1March 2010 the IPCC announced that &quot;No further action will be taken against the two men arrested following concerns identified by the internal Metropolitan police service (MPS) review of the murder of Stephen Lawrence&quot; and the two were released from bail.

On 6July 2023, the CPS decided that the four retired detectives who ran the original case would not face criminal charges for alleged corruption. The mother of Stephen Lawrence said she wanted to see a review of the decision.

====Revelations about undercover police conduct (2013)====
On 23June 2013, an interview with Peter Francis, a former Special Demonstration Squad undercover police officer, was published in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. In the interview Francis stated that while he was working undercover within an anti-racist campaign group in the mid-1990s, he was constantly pressured by superiors to smear Lawrence&#x27;s family so as to end campaigns for a better investigation into Lawrence&#x27;s death. After the allegation, the home secretary, Theresa May pledged to be &quot;ruthless about purging corruption from the police&quot;, and the prime minister, David Cameron, ordered police to investigate the allegations, saying that he was &quot;deeply worried about the reports&quot;.

Chief Constable Mick Creedon, who is leading Operation Herne, an ongoing inquiry into Metropolitan Police undercover operations against protest groups, said he would investigate the allegations as part of the inquiry. In October 2015 an inquiry was set up by the National Crime Agency to investigate allegations that members of the police force shielded the alleged killers.

====The Stephen Lawrence Independent Review (2014)====
Following the 2012 convictions of Dobson and Norris, further inquiries by both Scotland Yard and the Independent Police Complaints Commission ruled that there was no new evidence to warrant further investigation. After discussions with Doreen Lawrence, the home secretary Theresa May commissioned Mark Ellison QC (who had prosecuted Dobson and Norris) to review Scotland Yard&#x27;s investigations into alleged police corruption.

The report, titled &quot;The Stephen Lawrence Independent Review&quot;, was presented to Parliament on 6March 2014. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police said the report, which prompted an inquiry into undercover policing, was &quot;devastating&quot;. Ellison&#x27;s report also found there were possible links between an alleged corrupt police officer and the murder of private investigator Daniel Morgan in 1987.

== Legacy and recognition ==

An annual architectural award, the Stephen Lawrence Prize, was established in 1998 by the Marco Goldschmied Foundation in association with the Royal Institute of British Architects in Lawrence&#x27;s memory.

His mother, Doreen Lawrence, said, &quot;I would like Stephen to be remembered as a young man who had a future. He was well loved, and had he been given the chance to survive maybe he would have been the one to bridge the gap between black and white because he didn&#x27;t distinguish between black or white. He saw people as people.&quot;

In 1995 a memorial plaque was set into the pavement at the spot where he was killed on Well Hall Road. The plaque has been vandalised several times since then.

In 1999, Nicolas Kent designed a documentary play based on the trial, called &quot;The Colour of Justice&quot;. It was staged at the Tricycle Theatre and was later filmed by the BBC. It was also performed at the Guildford School of Acting for the 20th anniversary of the murder.

Peter Ackroyd, in his 2000 book &quot;&quot;, places the murder in the context of a historical pattern of “police incompetence and corruption … as old as the police force itself,” and that the investigation “revealed many instances of bad judgement and mismanagement; it also suggested implicit racial prejudice within the police force which has indeed been bedevilled [sic.] by that charge for fifty years.”

On 7February 2008, the Stephen Lawrence Centre, designed by architect David Adjaye, opened in Deptford, south-east London. A week later, it was vandalised in an attack that was initially believed to be racially motivated. However, doubt was cast on that assumption when CCTV evidence appeared to show one of the suspects to be mixed-race.

The Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust is a national educational charity committed to the advancement of social justice. The Trust provides educational and employability workshops and mentoring schemes. It also awards architectural and landscape bursaries. In 2008 the Trust, with architects RMJM, created the initiative Architecture for Everyone to help promote architecture and the creative industries to young people from ethnic minorities.

In October 2012, Doreen Lawrence received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 14th Pride of Britain Awards.

Doreen Lawrence was elevated to the peerage as a Baroness on 6September 2013, and is formally styled &quot;Baroness Lawrence of Clarendon, of Clarendon in the Commonwealth Realm of Jamaica&quot;; the honour is rare for being designated after a location in a Commonwealth realm outside the United Kingdom. She sits on the Labour benches in the House of Lords as a working peer specialising in race and diversity.

On 23April 2018, at a memorial service to mark the 25th anniversary of his death, Prime Minister Theresa May announced that &quot;Stephen Lawrence Day&quot; would be an annual national commemoration of his death on 22April every year starting in 2019. Doreen Lawrence made a statement that Stephen Lawrence Day would be &quot;an opportunity for young people to use their voices and should be embedded in our education and wider system regardless of the government of the day&quot;.

Part of the University of Reading&#x27;s Student Union building was named after Stephen in 1993, before being refurbished and renamed the ‘Stephen Lawrence Media Centre’ in 2013.

A Stephen Lawrence Research Centre was built at De Montfort University, located inside the Hugh Aston building. Lawrence&#x27;s mother was appointed chancellor of the university in January 2016. The centre hosted a series of special events for the 30th anniversary of Stephen&#x27;s murder in April 2023.

==In the media==
The case and its immediate aftermath were dramatised in the 1999 ITV film &quot;The Murder of Stephen Lawrence&quot;, starring Marianne Jean-Baptiste and Hugh Quarshie as Doreen and Neville Lawrence. A three-part sequel series, entitled &quot;Stephen&quot;, was broadcast in 2021. Quarshie reprised his role as Neville, alongside Sharlene Whyte as Doreen, and Steve Coogan as DCI Clive Driscoll.

&quot;Daily Mail&quot; journalist Stephen Wright has written about the Lawrence case, both before and subsequent to the prosecution. He received a Special Campaign Award as part of the 2012 Paul Foot Award for his work in the Lawrence case.

Novelist Deborah Crombie uses the turmoil following the Stephen Lawrence murder as a flashback setting in her 2017 book, &quot;The Garden of Lamentations&quot;. The story includes police officers who were undercover on both sides of the protests, as well as widespread corruption for years afterward. Crombie includes an explanation of the murder in her author&#x27;s note at the end of the book, but specifies that the rest of the characters are not meant to represent actual people.

Lawrence&#x27;s murder was the subject of the three-part documentary miniseries &quot;Stephen: The Murder That Changed a Nation&quot; that was first broadcast on BBC One in April 2018. Following the BBC broadcast, the Metropolitan Police publicly named Matthew White as the sixth suspect on 26June 2023. White had died in 2021 at the age of 50.

<text>Bulguksa () is a Buddhist temple on Tohamsan, in Jinhyeon-dong, Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea.

It is a head temple of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism and contains six National Treasures, including the Dabotap and Seokgatap stone pagodas, Cheongun-gyo (Blue Cloud Bridge), and two gilt-bronze statues of Buddha. The temple is classified as &quot;Historic and Scenic Site No. 1&quot; by the South Korean government. In 1995, Bulguksa and the nearby Seokguram Grotto were added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.

The temple is considered as a masterpiece of the golden age of Buddhist art in the Silla kingdom. It is currently the head temple of the 11th district of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism.

Among the earliest woodblock prints in the world, a version of the Dharani sutra dated between 704 and 751 was found there in 1966. Its Buddhist text was printed on a mulberry paper scroll.

==History==
The temple&#x27;s records state that a small temple was built on this site under King Beopheung in 528. The Samguk Yusa records that the current temple was constructed under King Gyeongdeok in 751, begun by chief minister Kim Daeseong to pacify the spirits of his parents. The building was completed in 774 by the Silla royal court, after Kim&#x27;s death, and given its current name Bulguksa (&quot;Temple of the Buddha Land&quot;).

The temple was renovated during the Goryeo Dynasty and the early Joseon Dynasty. During the Imjin wars, the wooden buildings were burned to the ground. After 1604, reconstruction and expansion of Bulguksa started, followed by about 40 renovations until 1805.

After World War II and the Korean War, a partial restoration was conducted in 1966. Upon an extensive archeological investigation, major restoration was conducted between 1969 and 1973 by the order of President Park Chung Hee, bringing Bulguksa to its current form. The famous stone structures are preserved from the original Silla construction.

Hyun Jin-geon published a historical novel on the construction of the Seokgatap and Dabotap pagodas, which were the basis for the 1957 South Korean drama film Shadowless Pagoda.

==Structure==
The temple is located on the slopes of Tohamsan, in Jinheon-dong, Gyeongju.

The entrance to the temple, &quot;Sokgyemun&quot;, has a double-sectioned staircase and bridge (National Treasure No. 23) that leads to the inside of the temple compound. The stairway is 33 steps high, corresponding to the 33 steps to enlightenment. The lower portion, &quot;Cheongungyo&quot; (Blue Cloud Bridge) is 6.3 meters long and has 17 steps. The upper portion, &quot;Baegungyo&quot; (White Cloud Bridge) is 5.4 meters and has 16 steps. The stairway leads to &quot;Jahamun&quot; (Mauve Mist Gate).

There are two pagodas on the temple site, which is unusual. The three-story Seokgatap (Sakyamuni Pagoda) which stands at 8.2 meters is a traditional Korean-style stone pagoda with simple lines and minimal detailing. Seokgatap is over 13 centuries old. Dabotap (Many Treasure Pagoda) is 10.4 meters tall and dedicated to the Many Treasures Buddha mentioned in the Lotus Sutra. In contrast to Seokgatap, Dabotap is known for its highly ornate structure. Its image is reproduced on the South Korean 10 won coin. &quot;Dabotap&quot; and &quot;Seokgatap&quot; are Korean National Treasures nos. 20 and 21, respectively.

The terrestrial and the two celestial abodes are manifested in Bulguksa: the terrestrial with a Shakyamuni Buddha &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;, the celestial with Amitabha Buddha &quot;Avatamska Sutra&quot;. The large temple site is centred on two courts. One of the courts is centred on &quot;Daeungjeon&quot;, the hall which houses the Shakyamuni Buddha. The other is centred on &quot;Geungnakjeon&quot;, the hall of paradise where the Seven Treasure Bridge &quot;Chilbogyo&quot; is housed.

&quot;Daeungjeon&quot; (대웅전,大雄殿), the Hall of Great Enlightenment, is the main hall. &quot;Dabotap&quot; and &quot;Seokgatap&quot; stand before this hall. The hall enshrines the Sakyamuni Buddha and was first built in 681. Behind the main hall stands &quot;Museoljeon&quot; (무설전,無說殿), the Hall of No Words. This hall gets its name from the belief that Buddha&#x27;s teachings could not be taught by mere words alone. It is one of the oldest buildings in the complex and was probably first built in 670. The &quot;Gwaneumjeon&quot; (Avalokitesvara&#x27;s Shrine, 관음전,觀音殿) houses an image of the Avalokitesvara, the Bodhisattva of Perfect Compassion, and stands at the highest point of the complex. The &quot;Birojeon&quot; (Vairocana Buddha Hall, 비로전,毘盧殿), which sits below the &quot;Gwaneumjeon&quot;, houses national treasure No. 26 while the &quot;Geuknakjeon&quot; (Hall of Supreme Bliss, 극락전), standing near the main compound, houses the gilt-bronze buddha that is the national treasure No. 27.

=== Official treasures ===

==== National Treasures No. 20 and 21 ====
The two famous stone pagodas, Dabotap and Seokgatap reside in the main courtyard of the Bulguksa Temple complex. They are, respectively, the twentieth and twenty-first national treasures of Korea and were designated on December 20, 1962.

==== National Treasure No. 22 ====
The &quot;Yeonhwagyo&quot; (Lotus Flower Bridge, 연화교,蓮華橋) and &quot;Chilbogyo&quot; (Seven Treasures Bridge, 칠보교,七寶橋) are a pair of bridges at Bulguksa. This bridge was designated as the 22nd national treasure on December 20, 1962. The bridge lead to &quot;Anyangmun&quot; (Peace Enhancing Gate, 안양문,安養門) leading to &quot;Geuknakjeon&quot; (the Hall of the Pure Land). This pair were built at the same time as their brother bridges, National Treasure No. 23.

These pair of bridges share the 45 degree incline, arch underneath, and the combination bridge/staircase design of their brother bridges. However, one noticeable difference is that this bridge is smaller. The lower Lotus Flower Bridge has 10 steps while the upper Seven Treasures Bridge contains 8 steps. This bridge is on the west in relation to the Blue Cloud and White Cloud Bridges. The Lotus Flower Bridge is known for its delicate carvings of Lotus Flowers on each step but these have faded with the weight of many pilgrims. Today, visitors are restricted from walking on the bridge.

===National Treasure No. 23===
The &quot;Cheongungyo&quot; (Blue Cloud Bridge, 청운교,靑雲橋) and &quot;Baegungyo&quot; (White Cloud Bridge, 백운교,白雲橋) Bridges of Bulguksa Temple are two bridges that are a part of a stairway that leads to the temple. The bridges were probably built in 750 during the reign of King Gyeongdeok. Although built separately, they are designated together as one single national treasure. They were designated as the 23rd national treasure on December 20, 1962.

The Blue Cloud Bridge makes up the upper span of the stair while the White Cloud Bridge is the lower part. The bridges lead to the &quot;Jahamun&quot; (Golden Purple Gate, 자하문,紫霞門) which leads to Sakyamuni Hall. There are 34 steps on the stairway, which slopes at a 30-degree angle. The upper Blue Cloud Bridge has sixteen steps while the lower White Cloud Bridge has eighteen. The large arch underneath the stairwell testifies to the use of arches in Silla-style bridges.

===National Treasure No. 26===
National Treasure No. 26 (경주 불국사 금동비로자나불좌상, 慶州 佛國寺 金銅毘盧遮那佛坐像, Gyeongju Bulguksa geumdong birojana buljwasang), designated on December 20, 1962, is a seated gilt-bronze Vairocana Buddha statue at Bulguksa Temple.

The Buddha of Enlightenment is enshrined in the &quot;Birojeon&quot;. It is 1.77 meters in height and made from gilt-bronze. The head of the Buddha has an usnisa, a symbol of supreme wisdom. The head of the Buddha was made by fusing two shells to each other and the face is elongated and soft. The robes of the Buddha are highly detailed and the simulation of folded cloth rippling down from the shoulder to the lap is done with high skill. The hands of the Buddha are in a position, the right index finger covered by the left hand, which often is used to symbolize the Buddha of Enlightenment. The figure is estimated to be from the 9th century due to stylistic evidence, including the overly wide lap and the lack of tension in the depiction of the robes and face of the Buddha.

===National Treasure No. 27===
The seated gilt-bronze Amitabha Buddha statue of Bulguksa Temple is National Treasure No. 27. (경주 불국사 금동아미타여래좌상, 慶州 佛國寺 金銅阿彌陀如來坐像, Gyeongju Bulguksa geumdong amita yeoraejwasang) and was designated on December 20, 1962.

The Amitabha Buddha statue is 1.66 meters in height and enshrined in &quot;Geuknakjeon&quot;. This gilt-bronze statue was probably cast in the late 8th or early part of the 9th century and it shares the style of National Treasure No. 26. The head of the statue is made by fixing two shell-like pieces together. The face has a distinctively aquiline nose. The Buddha has broad shoulders and strong chest while the large lap gives the figure a sense of proportional harmony and stability. The style of the robe seems to be more stylized and haphazard. The position of the left hand raised at shoulder-level palm forward and the right hand is placed at the lap. The style of the Buddha seems to follow an abstract and stylized tradition rather than a representation of realism.

===Treasure No. 61===
This sarira pagoda (사리탑), or stupa, looks like a stone lantern. It stands 2.1 meters tall and is located at the left side of the front garden of &quot;Birojeon&quot;. The artifact was at one point taken to Japan in 1906 but was returned in 1933. It is from the Goryeo Dynasty, but shows the influence of Silla Dynasty art.

A sarira is a container for the relics or remains of famous priests or royalty. It is said that this sarira contained the remains of eight priests or a queen. The three main features of the piece are the foundation stone, the main body, and the ornamental top. The foundation is an octagonal stone decorated with carvings. Atop this foundation is a circular stone incised with lotus motifs. The pillar supports of the main body are carved with a cloud motif while the main body is cylindrical and has four bas-reliefs of Buddha and bodhisattvas and are accompanied by flower motifs. The top of the pagoda has twelve sides which meet into a hexagonal shape.

<text> (&quot;Cinderella, or Goodness Triumphant&quot;) is an operatic in two acts by Gioachino Rossini. The libretto was written by Jacopo Ferretti, based on the libretti written by Charles-Guillaume Étienne for the opera &quot;Cendrillon&quot; with music by Nicolas Isouard (first performed Paris, 1810) and by Francesco Fiorini for with music by Stefano Pavesi (first performed Milan, 1814). All these operas are versions of the fairy tale &quot;Cendrillon&quot; by Charles Perrault. Rossini&#x27;s opera was first performed in Rome&#x27;s Teatro Valle on 25 January 1817.

In this variation of the fairy tale, the wicked stepmother is replaced by a stepfather, Don Magnifico. The Fairy Godmother is replaced by Alidoro, a philosopher and tutor to the Prince. Cinderella is identified not by a glass slipper but by her silver ring. The supernatural elements that traditionally characterize the Cinderella story were removed from the libretto simply for ease of staging.

Rossini composed when he was 25 years old, following the success of &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; the year before. , which he completed in a period of three weeks, is considered to have some of his finest writing for solo voice and ensembles.

== Composition history ==
According to the account given by librettist Jacopo Ferretti, the genesis of this work – whose literary and musical aspects were both created with surprising speed – began in December 1816. Rossini was in Rome and tasked with writing a new opera for the Teatro Valle, to be staged on Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day. An existing libretto, &quot;Francesca di Foix,&quot; had unexpectedly been vetoed by the papal censor, leaving no time to amend the text so that it might satisfy all parties involved (censorship, impresario, and authors). A replacement would have to be found.

Ferretti, despite harboring some ill-will against Rossini (the maestro had refused a libretto of his for &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;), nonetheless met with the composer and the impresario Cartoni and agreed to join the project. However, when he began to suggest topics for the new work, one after another was rejected: too serious for the Carnival season in which the opera would premiere; too frivolous; too expensive and difficult to stage. Ferretti proposed more than two dozen subjects without success.

Finally, between yawns, and with Rossini half asleep on a sofa, the poet mentioned Cinderella. At this, Rossini roused himself sufficiently to challenge Ferretti on whether he dared write a libretto for the tale; Ferretti retorted with a dare for Rossini to clothe it in music. Rossini then asked the librettist if he had some verses ready to start working on. Ferretti replied, &quot;despite my tiredness, tomorrow morning!&quot; The composer nodded, wrapped himself in his clothes, and fell asleep.

Ferretti worked through the night and had the first parts of the work ready as promised in the morning. He finished the libretto in twenty-two days of breakneck work, and Rossini completed the score in an equally hectic twenty-four days. Rossini saved some time by reusing an overture from and part of an aria from &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; and by enlisting a collaborator, Luca Agolini, who wrote the secco recitatives and three numbers (Alidoro&#x27;s &quot;, Clorinda&#x27;s &quot; and the chorus &quot;&quot;).

The poet had serious doubts about the success of this opera; Rossini, on the other hand, predicted that it would conquer Italy in a year and spread to France and England in another: &quot;the impresarios will fight for staging it, as well as the prima donnas for being able to sing it&quot;.

&quot;La Cenerentola&quot; premiered on 25 January 1817, and quickly gained popularity both in Italy and internationally, despite a cold initial reception by the critics. In short, Rossini&#x27;s prediction came entirely true, and &quot;Cenerentola&quot; soon overshadowed even &quot;Barber&quot; throughout the nineteenth century. 

The facsimile edition of the autograph has a different aria for Alidoro, &quot;; this seems to have been added by an anonymous hand for an 1818 production. For an 1820 revival in Rome, Rossini wrote a bravura replacement, &quot;.

Despite La Cenerentola&#x27;s success, the collaboration between composer and librettist got no easier, and Ferretti wrote only one more libretto for Rossini, &quot;Matilde di Shabran&quot;, in 1821.

==Performance history==
19th century

At the first performance, the opera was received with some hostility, but it soon became popular throughout Italy and beyond; it reached Lisbon in 1819, London in 1820 and New York in 1826. Throughout most of the 19th century, its popularity rivalled that of &quot;Barber&quot;, but as the coloratura contralto, for which the leading role was originally written, became rare, it fell slowly out of the repertoire.

20th century and beyond

In the years following Glyndebourne Festival&#x27;s celebrated 1952 revival, conducted by Vittorio Gui, and recorded for LP by EMI, Rossini&#x27;s work enjoyed a renaissance, and a new generation of Rossini mezzo-sopranos ensured that &quot;La Cenerentola&quot; would once again be heard around the world. The opera is now considered a staple of the standard repertoire.

==Synopsis==
:Time: Late 18th century – early 19th century
:Place: Salerno (Italy)

===Act 1===

Angelina, known to her stepfather and stepsisters as &quot;Cenerentola,&quot; is forced to serve as the maid in her own home. She sings of a king who married a common girl chosen for her kindness against the beauty and adornment of her competitresses (&quot;Una volta c’era un rè&quot;). A beggar arrives; her stepsisters, Clorinda and Tisbe, want to send him away, but Cenerentola gives him bread and coffee. Courtiers follow, announcing that Prince Ramiro will visit while he searches for the most beautiful girl in the land to wed. Cenerentola&#x27;s stepfather, Don Magnifico, hopes to use this as an opportunity to save his own failing fortune.

When the room is empty, Ramiro enters alone, disguised as a valet. The &quot;beggar&quot; – in fact, his tutor, Alidoro – has informed him of a goodhearted young woman spotted here. Ramiro intends to find her incognito. Cenerentola returns, and she and Ramiro are attracted to each other (duet: &quot;Un soave non-so che&quot;), but when he asks who she is, she is overwhelmed and flees.

Finally, the &quot;prince&quot; arrives – the real valet, Dandini, who has taken his master&#x27;s place – and Magnifico, Clorinda, and Tisbe fall over themselves to flatter him. He invites the family to a ball that evening, where he plans to find his bride; Cenerentola asks to join them, but Magnifico refuses (quintet: &quot;Signor, una parola&quot;). This callousness isn&#x27;t lost on Ramiro. Alidoro returns to inquire after a third daughter in the house; Magnifico claims she has died and stealthily threatens to murder Cenerentola if she reveals herself. Left alone with Cenerentola, Alidoro promises to take her to the ball himself and that God will reward her kindness (&quot;Là del ciel nell’arcano profondo&quot;).

The prince and his valet have retired to Ramiro&#x27;s country house in some confusion, as neither of Magnifico&#x27;s daughters resembled the worthy bride Alidoro had described. When Clorinda and Tisbe arrive, Dandini gives them a little test: he offers his &quot;valet&quot; to whichever sister the &quot;prince&quot; does not marry. The ladies are outraged at the idea of marrying a servant. Alidoro then arrives with a beautiful, unknown lady who strangely resembles Cenerentola. Unable to make sense of the situation, they all sit down to supper, feeling like they are in a dream.

===Act 2===

Magnifico frets over the competition his daughters now face from the strange lady (&quot;Sia qualunque delle figlie&quot;), but Cenerentola isn&#x27;t interested in the &quot;prince,&quot; saying she&#x27;s fallen in love with his servant. An overjoyed Ramiro steps forward; however, Cenerentola tells him that she&#x27;s going home and doesn&#x27;t want him to follow her. If he really cares for her, she says, he will find her, giving him one of a matching pair of bracelets. The prince determines to do exactly that (&quot;Sì, ritrovarla io giuro&quot;).

Meanwhile, Magnifico confronts the disguised Dandini, insisting that he choose one of his daughters to marry. Dandini tries to stall but is forced to admit that he&#x27;s actually the valet and not the prince at all (duet: &quot;Un segreto d’importanza&quot;).

A furious Magnifico and his daughters return home, where they order Cenerentola, back in rags, to serve them. A storm is thundering outside. Alidoro sabotages Ramiro&#x27;s carriage so that it breaks down in front of Magnifico&#x27;s manor, forcing the prince to take refuge within. Ramiro recognizes Cenerentola&#x27;s bracelet on her right arm; the others comment on the situation (sextet: &quot;Siete voi?&quot;). When Ramiro threatens Cenerentola&#x27;s recalcitrant family, she asks him to forgive them.

Ramiro and Cenerentola are married and celebrate their wedding at the palace. Magnifico tries to win the new princess&#x27;s favor, but she asks only to be acknowledged, at last, as his daughter. She reflects on the misfortune to which she was born and the sudden reversal of her fate, then forgives her family for all her past unhappiness, adding that her days of sitting sadly by the fire are over (&quot;Nacqui all&#x27;affanno... Non più mesta&quot;). Everyone present acknowledges that she truly is worthy of the throne.

<text>A role-playing video game, role-playing game (RPG) or computer role-playing game (CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (or several party members) that will undergo some form of character development by way of recording statistics. Also, they are usually immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in tabletop role-playing games and use much of the same terminology, settings, and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replay value and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences.

==Characteristics==
Role-playing video games use much of the same terminology, settings and game mechanics as early tabletop role-playing games such as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.
Players control a central game character, or multiple game characters, usually called a party, that will grow in power and abilities. Also, characters are typically designed by the player. Usually, the characters attain victory by completing a series of quests or reaching the conclusion of a central storyline. Players explore a game world, while solving puzzles and engaging in combat.

Role-playing games are traditionally divided into turn-based RPGs, that rarely challenge a player&#x27;s physical coordination or reaction time, and action-based RPGs, that do the opposite.

Role-playing video games typically rely on a highly developed story and setting, which is divided into a number of quests. Players control one or several characters by issuing commands, which are performed by the character at an effectiveness determined by that character&#x27;s numeric attributes. Often these attributes increase each time a character gains a level, and a character&#x27;s level goes up each time the player accumulates a certain amount of experience.

Role-playing video games also typically attempt to offer more complex and dynamic character interaction than what is found in other video game genres. This usually involves additional focus on the artificial intelligence and scripted behavior of computer-controlled non-player characters.

===Experience and levels===

In order to be considered a role-playing game, characters have to become more functionally powerful by gaining new skills, weapons, and magic. This creates a positive-feedback cycle that is central to these games: the player grows in power, allowing them to overcome more difficult challenges, and gain even more power. This is part of the appeal of the genre, where players experience growing from an ordinary person into a superhero with amazing powers. Whereas other games give the player these powers immediately, the player in a role-playing game will choose their powers and skills as they gain experience.

Three different systems of rewarding the player characters for solving the tasks in the game can be set apart: the &quot;experience system&quot; (also known as the &quot;level-based&quot; system), the &quot;training system&quot; (also known as the &quot;skill-based&quot; system) and the &quot;skill-point system&quot; (also known as &quot;level-free&quot; system)
*The &quot;experience system&quot;, by far the most common, was inherited from pen-and-paper role-playing games and emphasizes receiving &quot;experience points&quot; (often abbreviated &quot;XP&quot; or &quot;EXP&quot;) by winning battles, performing class-specific activities, and completing quests. Once a certain amount of experience is gained, the character advances a level. In some games, level-up occurs automatically when the required amount of experience is reached; in others, the player can choose when and where to advance a level. Likewise, abilities and attributes may increase automatically or manually.
*The &quot;training system&quot; is similar to the way the &quot;Basic Role-Playing&quot; system works. The first notable video game to use this was &quot;Dungeon Master&quot;, which emphasized developing the character&#x27;s skills by using them—meaning that if a character wields a sword for some time, he or she will become proficient with it.
*Finally, in the &quot;skill-point system&quot; (as used in &quot;&quot; for example) the character is rewarded with &quot;skill points&quot; for completing quests, which then can be directly used to buy skills and attributes without having to wait until the next level up.

In some video games from the Eighties and Nineties, the score was called &quot;Experience&quot; in-game, but this did not make them role-playing games, if there was no character development. 

===Story and setting===

The premise of many role-playing games tasks the player with saving the world, or whichever level of society is threatened. There are often twists and turns as the story progresses, such as the surprise appearance of estranged relatives, or enemies who become friends or vice versa. The game world is often rooted in speculative fiction (i.e. fantasy or science fiction), which allows players to do things they cannot do in real life and helps players suspend their disbelief about the rapid character growth. To a lesser extent, settings closer to the present day or near future are possible.

The story often provides much of the entertainment in the game. Because these games have strong storylines, they can often make effective use of recorded dialog and voiceover narration. Players of these games tend to appreciate long cutscenes more than players of faster action games. While most games advance the plot when the player defeats an enemy or completes a level, role-playing games often progress the plot based on other important decisions. For example, a player may make the decision to join a guild, thus triggering a progression in the storyline that is usually irreversible. New elements in the story may also be triggered by mere arrival in an area, rather than completing a specific challenge. The plot is usually divided so that each game location is an opportunity to reveal a new chapter in the story.

Pen-and-paper role-playing games typically involve a player called the gamemaster (or GM for short) who can dynamically create the story, setting, and rules, and react to a player&#x27;s choices. In role-playing video games, the computer performs the function of the gamemaster. This offers the player a smaller set of possible actions, since computers can&#x27;t engage in imaginative acting comparable to a skilled human gamemaster. In exchange, the typical role-playing video game may have storyline branches, user interfaces, and stylized cutscenes and gameplay to offer a more direct storytelling mechanism. Characterization of non-player characters in video games is often handled using a dialog tree. Saying the right things to the right non-player characters will elicit useful information for the player, and may even result in other rewards such as items or experience, as well as opening up possible storyline branches. Multiplayer online role-playing games can offer an exception to this contrast by allowing human interaction among multiple players and in some cases enabling a player to perform the role of a gamemaster.

===Exploration and quests===
Exploring the world is an important aspect of many RPGs. Players will walk through, talking to non-player characters, picking up objects, and avoiding traps. Some games such as &quot;NetHack&quot;, &quot;Diablo&quot;, and the &quot;FATE&quot; series randomize the structure of individual levels, increasing the game&#x27;s variety and replay value. Role-playing games where players complete quests by exploring randomly generated dungeons and which include permadeath are called roguelikes, named after the 1980 video game &quot;Rogue&quot;.

The game&#x27;s story is often mapped onto exploration, where each chapter of the story is mapped onto a different location. RPGs usually allow players to return to previously visited locations. Usually, there is nothing left to do there, although some locations change throughout the story and offer the player new things to do in response. Players must acquire enough power to overcome a major challenge in order to progress to the next area, and this structure can be compared to the boss characters at the end of levels in action games.

The player typically must complete a linear sequence of certain quests in order to reach the end of the game&#x27;s story. Many RPGs also often allow the player to seek out optional side-quests and character interactions. Quests of this sort can be found by talking to a non-player character, and there may be no penalty for abandoning or ignoring these quests other than a missed opportunity or reward.

===Items and inventory===
Players can find loot (such as clothing, weapons, and armor) throughout the game world and collect it. Players can trade items for currency and better equipment. Trade takes place while interacting with certain friendly non-player characters, such as shopkeepers, and often uses a specialized trading screen. Purchased items go into the player&#x27;s inventory. Some games turn inventory management into a logistical challenge by limiting the size of the player&#x27;s inventory, thus forcing the player to decide what they must carry at the time. This can be done by limiting the maximum weight that a player can carry, by employing a system of arranging items in a virtual space, or by simply limiting the number of items that can be held.

===Character actions and abilities===

Most of the actions in a Role-Playing Game are performed indirectly, with the player selecting an action and the character performing it by their own accord. Success at that action depends on the character&#x27;s numeric attributes. Role-playing video games often simulate dice-rolling mechanics from non-electronic role-playing games to determine success or failure. As a character&#x27;s attributes improve, their chances of succeeding at a particular action will increase.

Many role-playing games allow players to play as an evil character. Although robbing and murdering indiscriminately may make it easier to get money, there are usually consequences in that other characters will become uncooperative or even hostile towards the player. Thus, these games allow players to make moral choices, but force players to live with the consequences of their actions. Games often let the player control an entire party of characters. However, if winning is contingent upon the survival of a single character, then that character effectively becomes the player&#x27;s avatar. An example of this would be in &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;, where if the character created by the player dies, the game ends and a previous save needs to be loaded.

Although some single-player role-playing games give the player an avatar that is largely predefined for the sake of telling a specific story, many role-playing games make use of a character creation screen. This allows players to choose their character&#x27;s sex, their race or species, and their character class. Although many of these traits are cosmetic, there are functional aspects as well. Character classes will have different abilities and strengths. Common classes include fighters, spellcasters, thieves with stealth abilities, and clerics with healing abilities, or a mixed class, such as a fighter who can cast simple spells. Characters will also have a range of physical attributes such as dexterity and strength, which affect a player&#x27;s performance in combat. Mental attributes such as intelligence may affect a player&#x27;s ability to perform and learn spells, while social attributes such as charisma may limit the player&#x27;s choices while conversing with non-player characters. These attribute systems often strongly resemble the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; ruleset.

Some role-playing games make use of magical powers, or equivalents such as psychic powers or advanced technology. These abilities are confined to specific characters such as mages, spellcasters, or magic-users. In games where the player controls multiple characters, these magic-users usually complement the physical strength of other classes. Magic can be used to attack, defend, or temporarily change an enemy or ally&#x27;s attributes. While some games allow players to gradually consume a spell, as ammunition is consumed by a gun, most games offer players a finite amount of mana which can be spent on any spell. Mana is restored by resting or by consuming potions. Characters can also gain other non-magical skills, which stay with the character for as long as the character lives.

Role-playing games may have the player focus only on a single character throughout the game; the character may be joined by computer-controlled allies outside of the player&#x27;s control. Other games feature a party that the player can create at the start or gather from non-player characters in the game, coming into partial or full control of the player during the game.

===Combat===
Older games often separated combat into its own mode of gameplay, distinct from exploring the game world. More recent games tend to maintain a consistent perspective for exploration and combat. Some games, especially earlier video games, generate battles from random encounters; more modern RPGs are more likely to have persistent wandering monsters that move about the game world independently of the player. Most RPGs also use stationary boss monsters in key positions, and automatically trigger battles with them when the PCs enter these locations or perform certain actions. Combat options typically involve positioning characters, selecting which enemy to attack, and exercising special skills such as casting spells.

In a classical turn-based system, only one character may act at a time; all other characters remain still, with a few exceptions that may involve the use of special abilities. The order in which the characters act is usually dependent on their attributes, such as speed or agility. This system rewards strategic planning more than quickness. It also points to the fact that realism in games is a means to the end of immersion in the game world, not an end in itself. A turn-based system makes it possible, for example, to run within range of an opponent and kill them before they get a chance to act, or duck out from behind hard cover, fire, and retreat back without an opponent being able to fire, which are of course both impossibilities. However, tactical possibilities have been created by this unreality that did not exist before; the player determines whether the loss of immersion in the reality of the game is worth the satisfaction gained from the development of the tactic and its successful execution. &quot;Fallout&quot; has been cited as being a good example of such a system.

Real-time combat can import features from action games, creating a hybrid action RPG game genre. But other RPG battle systems such as the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; battle systems have imported real-time choices without emphasizing coordination or reflexes. Other systems combine real-time combat with the ability to pause the game and issue orders to all characters under his/her control; when the game is unpaused, all characters follow the orders they were given. This &quot;real-time with pause&quot; system (&quot;RTwP&quot;) has been particularly popular in games designed by BioWare. The most famous RTwP engine is the Infinity Engine. Other names for &quot;real-time with pause&quot; include &quot;active pause&quot; and &quot;semi real-time&quot;. Tactical RPG maker Apeiron named their system Smart Pause Mode (SPM) because it would automatically pause based on a number of user-configurable settings. &quot;Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel&quot; and &quot;&quot; offered players the option to play in either turn-based or RTwP mode via a configuration setting. The latter also offered a &quot;fast turn-based&quot; mode, though all three game modes were criticized for being poorly balanced and oversimplified.

Early &quot;Ultima&quot; games featured timed turns: they were strictly turn-based, but if the player waited more than a second or so to issue a command, the game would automatically issue a pass command, allowing the monsters to take a turn while the PCs did nothing.

There is a further subdivision by the structure of the battle system; in many early games, such as &quot;Wizardry&quot;, monsters and the party are arrayed into ranks, and can only attack enemies in the front rank with melee weapons. Other games, such as most of the &quot;Ultima&quot; series, employed duplicates of the miniatures combat system traditionally used in the early role-playing games. Representations of the player characters and monsters would move around an arena modeled after the surrounding terrain, attacking any enemies that are sufficiently close.

===Interface and graphics===

Earlier role-playing video games used a two-dimensional top-down view or tile-based first-person view. Early action-based role-playing games often used a side-scrolling view. Most notably since &quot;Ultima Underworld&quot; (1992), role-playing games started implementing true three-dimensional (3D) graphics, where players typically navigate the game world from a first or third-person perspective. However, an isometric or aerial top-down perspective is common in party-based RPGs, in order to give the player a clear view of their entire party and their surroundings.

Role-playing games require the player to manage a large amount of information and frequently use a windowed interface. For example, spell-casting characters will often have a menu of spells they can use. On the PC, players typically use the mouse to click on icons and menu options, while console games have the player navigate through menus using a game controller.

==History and classification==

The role-playing video game genre began in the mid-1970s on mainframe computers, inspired by pen-and-paper role-playing games such as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Several other sources of inspiration for early role-playing video games also included tabletop wargames, sports simulation games, adventure games such as &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot;, fantasy writings by authors such as J. R. R. Tolkien, traditional strategy games such as chess, and ancient epic literature dating back to &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; which followed the same basic structure of setting off in various quests in order to accomplish goals.

Originally, role-playing video games were classified into three main styles: roguelikes (named after &quot;Rogue&quot;, 1980) that focused on exploration of procedurally created mazes; dungeon crawlers (popularized by &quot;Wizardry&quot;, 1981), that took place within one or few dungeons, with little or no interaction with an outer world; and open worlds (popularized by &quot;Ultima&quot;, 1981), that include an explorable world surface with several dungeons, cities, continents, and more.

After the success of role-playing video games such as &quot;Ultima&quot; and &quot;Wizardry&quot;, which in turn served as the blueprint for &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, the role-playing genre eventually diverged into two styles, &quot;Eastern role-playing games&quot; and &quot;Western role-playing games&quot;, due to cultural differences, though roughly mirroring the platform divide between consoles and computers, respectively. Finally, while the first RPGs offered strictly a single player experience, the popularity of multiplayer modes rose sharply during the early to mid-1990s with action role-playing games such as &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; and &quot;Diablo&quot;. With the advent of the Internet, multiplayer games have grown to become massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG), including &quot;Lineage&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;, and &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;.

===Mainframe computers===
The role-playing video game genre began in the mid-1970s, as an offshoot of early university mainframe text-based RPGs on PDP-10 and Unix-based computers, such as &quot;Dungeon&quot;, pedit5 and dnd. In 1980, a very popular dungeon crawler, &quot;Rogue&quot;, was released. Featuring ASCII graphics where the setting, monsters and items were represented by letters and a deep system of gameplay, it inspired a whole genre of similar clones on mainframe and home computers called &quot;roguelikes&quot;.

===Personal computers===
One of the earliest role-playing video games on a microcomputer was &quot;Dungeon n Dragons&quot;, written by Peter Trefonas and published by CLOAD (1980). This early game, published for a TRS-80 Model 1, is just 16K long and includes a limited word parser command line, character generation, a store to purchase equipment, combat, traps to solve, and a dungeon to explore. Other contemporaneous CRPGs (Computer Role Playing Games) were &quot;Temple of Apshai&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;, the precursor to &quot;Ultima&quot;. Some early microcomputer RPGs (such as &quot;Telengard&quot; (1982) or &quot;Sword of Fargoal&quot;) were based on their mainframe counterparts, while others (such as &quot;Ultima&quot; or &quot;Wizardry&quot;, the most successful of the early CRPGs) were loose adaptations of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;. They also include both first-person displays and overhead views, sometimes in the same game (&quot;Akalabeth&quot;, for example, uses both perspectives). Most of the key features of RPGs were developed in this early period, prior to the release of &quot;Ultima III: Exodus&quot;, one of the prime influences on both computer and console RPG development. For example, &quot;Wizardry&quot; features menu-driven combat, &quot;Tunnels of Doom&quot; features tactical combat on a special &quot;combat screen&quot;, and &quot;Dungeons of Daggorath&quot; features real-time combat which takes place on the main dungeon map.

Starting in 1984 with &quot;Questron&quot; and &quot;50 Mission Crush&quot;, SSI produced many series of CRPGs. Their 1985 game &quot;Phantasie&quot; is notable for introducing automapping and in-game scrolls providing hints and background information. They also released &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; in 1988, the first of several &quot;Gold Box&quot; CRPGs based on the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons rules&quot;. These games feature a first-person display for movement, combined with an overhead tactical display for combat. One common feature of RPGs from this era, which Matt Barton calls the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of computer RPGs, is the use of numbered &quot;paragraphs&quot; printed in the manual or adjunct booklets, containing the game&#x27;s lengthier texts; the player can be directed to read a certain paragraph, instead of being shown the text on screen. The ultimate exemplar of this approach is Sir-Tech&#x27;s &quot;Star Saga&quot; trilogy (of which only two games were released); the first game contains 888 &quot;textlets&quot; (usually much longer than a single paragraph) spread across 13 booklets, while the second contains 50,000 paragraphs spread across 14 booklets. Most of the games from this era are turn-based, although &quot;Dungeon Master&quot; and its imitators have real-time combat. Other classic titles from this era include &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1985), &quot;Wasteland&quot; (1988), the start of the &quot;Might and Magic&quot; (1986–2014) series and the continuing &quot;Ultima&quot; (1981–1999) series.

Later, in the middle to late 1990s, isometric, sprite-based RPGs became commonplace, with video game publishers Interplay Entertainment and Blizzard North playing a lead role with such titles as the &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;, &quot;Icewind Dale&quot; and the action-RPG &quot;Diablo&quot; series, as well as the dialogue-heavy &quot;&quot; and cult classics &quot;Fallout&quot; and &quot;Fallout 2&quot;. This era also saw a move toward 3D game engines with such games as &quot;Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven&quot; and &quot;The Elder Scrolls: Arena&quot;. TSR, dissatisfied with SSI&#x27;s later products, such as &quot;Dark Sun: Wake of the Ravager&quot; and &quot;Menzoberranzan&quot;, transferred the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; license to several different developers, and eventually gave it to BioWare, who used it in &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot; (1998) and several later games. By the 2000s, 3D engines had become dominant.

===Video game consoles===
The earliest RPG on a console was &quot;Dragonstomper&quot; on the Atari 2600 in 1982. Another early RPG on a console was &quot;Bokosuka Wars&quot;, originally released for the Sharp X1 computer in 1983 and later ported to the MSX in 1984, the NES in 1985 and the Sharp X68000 as &quot;New Bokosuka Wars&quot;. The game laid the foundations for the tactical role-playing game genre, or &quot;simulation RPG&quot; genre as it is known in Japan. It was also an early example of a real-time, action role-playing game. In 1986, Chunsoft created the NES title &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; (called &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; in North America until the eighth game), which drew inspiration from computer RPGs &quot;Ultima&quot; and &quot;Wizardry&quot; and is regarded as the template for future Japanese role-playing video games released since then.

Also in 1986 The Legend of Zelda was released for the NES. While not a role-playing game, it did inspire many aspects of future action-RPGs. 

In 1987, the genre came into its own with the release of several highly influential console RPGs distinguishing themselves from computer RPGs, including the genre-defining Phantasy Star, released for the Master System. Shigeru Miyamoto&#x27;s &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot; for the Famicom Disk System was one of the earliest action role-playing games, combining the action-adventure game framework of its predecessor &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; with the statistical elements of turn-based RPGs. Most RPGs at this time were turn-based. &quot;Faxanadu&quot; was another early action RPG for the NES, released as a side-story to the computer action RPG &quot;Dragon Slayer II: Xanadu&quot;. Square&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; for the NES introduced side-view battles, with the player characters on the right and the enemies on the left, which soon became the norm for numerous console RPGs. In 1988, &quot;Dragon Warrior III&quot; introduced a character progression system allowing the player to change the party&#x27;s character classes during the course of the game. Another &quot;major innovation was the introduction of day/night cycles; certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at certain times of day.&quot; In 1989, &quot;Phantasy Star II&quot; for the Genesis established many conventions of the genre, including an epic, dramatic, character-driven storyline dealing with serious themes and subject matter.

Console RPGs distinguished themselves from computer RPGs to a greater degree in the early 1990s. As console RPGs became more heavily story-based than their computer counterparts, one of the major differences that emerged during this time was in the portrayal of the characters. Console RPGs often featured intricately related characters who had distinctive personalities and traits, with players assuming the roles of people who cared about each other, fell in love or even had families. Romance in particular was a theme that was common in most console RPGs at the time but absent from most computer RPGs. During the 1990s, console RPGs had become increasingly dominant, exerting a greater influence on computer RPGs than the other way around. Console RPGs had eclipsed computer RPGs for some time, though computer RPGs began making a comeback towards the end of the decade with interactive choice-filled adventures.

The next major revolution came in the late 1990s, which saw the rise of optical disks in fifth generation consoles. The implications for RPGs were enormous—longer, more involved quests, better audio, and full-motion video. This was first clearly demonstrated in 1997 by the phenomenal success of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, which is considered one of the most influential games of all time. With a record-breaking production budget of around $45 million, the ambitious scope of &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; raised the possibilities for the genre, with its dozens of minigames and much higher production values. The latter includes innovations such as the use of 3D characters on pre-rendered backgrounds, battles viewed from multiple different angles rather than a single angle, and for the first time full-motion CGI video seamlessly blended into the gameplay, effectively integrated throughout the game. The game was soon ported to the PC and gained much success there, as did several other originally console RPGs, blurring the line between the console and computer platforms.

===Cultural differences===
Computer-driven role-playing games had their start in Western markets, with games generally geared to be played on home computers. By 1985, series like &quot;Wizardry&quot; and &quot;Ultima&quot; represented the state of the art in role-playing games. In Japan, home computers had yet to take as great a hold as they had in the West due to their cost; there was little market for Western-developed games and there were a few Japanese-developed games for personal computers during this time such as &quot;The Black Onyx&quot; (1984) which followed the &quot;Wizardry&quot;/&quot;Ultima&quot; format. With the release of the low-cost Famicom console (called the Nintendo Entertainment System overseas), a new opportunity arose to bring role-playing games to Japan. &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; (1986) was the first such attempt to recreate a role-playing game for a console, and requires several simplifications to fit within the more limited memory and capabilities of the Famicom compared to computers; players in &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; controlled only a single character, the amount of control over this character limited due to the simplicity of the Famicom controller, and a less-realistic art style was chosen to better visualize the characters within a tile-based graphics system. &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; was highly successful in Japan, leading to further entries in the series and other titles such as &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; that followed the same simplifications made in RPGs for &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;. Because of these differences, the role-playing genre began to be classified into two fairly distinct styles: &quot;computer RPG&quot; and &quot;console RPG&quot;.

By the early 2000s, the distinction between platforms became less pronounced as the same games appeared on both console and computer, but stylistic differences between Western role-playing games (WRPGs) and Japanese role-playing games (JRPGs) remained, rooted in the earlier distinctions. Though sharing fundamental premises, WRPGs tend to feature darker graphics, older characters, and a greater focus on roaming freedom, realism, and the underlying game mechanics (e.g. &quot;rules-based&quot; or &quot;system-based&quot;); whereas JRPGs tend to feature brighter, anime-like or chibi graphics, younger characters, turn-based or faster-paced action gameplay, and a greater focus on tightly orchestrated, linear storylines with intricate plots (e.g. &quot;action-based&quot; or &quot;story-based&quot;). Further, WRPGs are more likely to allow players to create and customize characters from scratch, and since the late 1990s have had a stronger focus on extensive dialog tree systems (e.g. &quot;&quot;). On the other hand, JRPGs tend to limit players to developing pre-defined player characters, and often do not allow the option to create or choose one&#x27;s own playable characters or make decisions that alter the plot. In the early 1990s, JRPGs were seen as being much closer to fantasy novels, but by the late 1990s had become more cinematic in style (e.g. &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series). At the same time, WRPGs started becoming more novelistic in style (e.g. &quot;Planescape: Torment&quot;), but by the late 2000s had also adopted a more cinematic style (e.g. &quot;Mass Effect&quot;).

One reason given for these differences is that many early Japanese console RPGs can be seen as forms of interactive manga or anime wrapped around Western rule systems at the time, in addition to the influence of visual novel adventure games. As a result, Japanese console RPGs differentiated themselves with a stronger focus on scripted narratives and character drama, alongside streamlined gameplay. In recent years, these trends have in turn been adopted by WRPGs, which have begun moving more towards tightly structured narratives, in addition to moving away from &quot;numbers and rules&quot; in favor of streamlined combat systems similar to action games. In addition, a large number of Western indie games are modelled after JRPGs, especially those of the 16-bit era, partly due to the &quot;RPG Maker&quot; game development tools.

Another oft-cited difference is the prominence or absence of &quot;kawaisa&quot;, or &quot;cuteness&quot;, in Japanese culture, and different approaches with respect to character aesthetics. WRPGs tend to maintain a serious and gritty tone, whereas JRPG protagonists tend to be designed with an emphasis on aesthetic beauty, and even male characters are often young, androgynous, shōnen or bishōnen in appearance. JRPGs often have cute characters, juxtaposed with more mature themes and situations; and many modern JRPGs feature characters designed in the same style as those in manga and anime. The stylistic differences are often due to differing target audiences: Western RPGs are usually geared primarily towards teenage to adult males, whereas Japanese RPGs are usually intended for a much larger demographic, including female audiences, who, for example, accounted for nearly a third of &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot; playerbase. In 2015, IGN noted in an interview with &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles X&quot; development team that the label &quot;JRPG&quot; is most commonly used to refer to RPGs &quot;whose presentation mimics the design sensibilities&quot; of anime and manga, that it&#x27;s &quot;typically the presentation and character archetypes&quot; that signal &quot;this is a JRPG.&quot;

Modern JRPGs are more likely to feature turn-based battles; while modern WRPGs are more likely to feature real-time combat. In the past, the reverse was often true: real-time action role-playing games were far more common among Japanese console RPGs than Western computer RPGs up until the late 1990s, due to gamepads usually being better suited to real-time action than the keyboard and mouse.

Some journalists and video game designers have questioned this cultural classification, arguing that the differences between Eastern and Western games have been exaggerated. In an interview held at the American Electronic Entertainment Expo, Japanese video game developer Tetsuya Nomura (who worked on &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;) emphasized that RPGs should not be classified by country-of-origin, but rather described simply for what they are: role-playing games. Hironobu Sakaguchi, creator of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;The Last Story&quot;, noted that, while &quot;users like to categorise&quot; JRPGs as &quot;turn-based, traditional styles&quot; and WRPGs as &quot;born from first-person shooters,&quot; there &quot;are titles that don&#x27;t fit the category,&quot; pointing to &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; (which he also worked on) and the &quot;Mana&quot; games. He further noted that there have been &quot;other games similar to the style of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;,&quot; but that &quot;it&#x27;s probably because the games weren&#x27;t localised and didn&#x27;t reach the Western audience.&quot; &quot;Xeno&quot; series director Tetsuya Takahashi, in reference to &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles&quot;, stated that &quot;I don&#x27;t know when exactly people started using the term &#x27;JRPG,&#x27; but if this game makes people rethink the meaning of this term, I&#x27;ll be satisfied.&quot; The writer Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com states that &quot;&quot;Xenoblade&quot; throws into high relief the sheer artificiality of the gaming community&#x27;s obsession over the differences between&quot; Western and Japanese RPGs, pointing out that it &quot;does things that don&#x27;t really fit into either genre. Gamers do love their boundaries and barriers and neat little rules, I know, but just because you cram something into a little box doesn&#x27;t mean it belongs there.&quot; Nick Doerr of Joystiq criticizes the claim that JRPGs are &quot;too linear&quot;, pointing out that non-linear JRPGs are not uncommon—for instance, the &quot;Romancing SaGa&quot; series. Likewise, Rowan Kaiser of Joystiq points out that linear WRPGs were common in the 1990s, and argues that many of the often mentioned differences between Eastern and Western games are stereotypes that are generally &quot;not true&quot; and &quot;never was&quot;, pointing to classic examples like &quot;Lands of Lore&quot; and &quot;Betrayal at Krondor&quot; that were more narrative-focused than the typical Western-style RPGs of the time.

====Criticisms====
Due to the cultural differences between Western and Japanese variations of role-playing games, both have often been compared and critiqued by those within the video games industry and the press.

In the late 1980s, when traditional American computer RPGs such as &quot;Ultima&quot; and &quot;Defender of the Crown&quot; were ported to consoles, they received mixed reviews from console gamers, as they were &quot;not perceived, by many of the players, to be as exciting as the Japanese imports&quot;, and lacked the arcade and action-adventure elements commonly found in Japanese console RPGs at the time. In the early 1990s, American computer RPGs also began facing criticism for their plots, where &quot;the party sticks together through thick and thin&quot; and always &quot;act together as a group&quot; rather than as individuals, and where non-player characters are &quot;one-dimensional characters&quot;, in comparison to the more fantasy novel approach of Squaresoft console RPGs such as &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;. However, in 1994, game designer Sandy Petersen noted that, among computer gamers, there was criticism against cartridge-based console JRPGs being &quot;not role-playing at all&quot; due to popular examples such as &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; and especially &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; using &quot;direct&quot; arcade-style action combat systems instead of the more &quot;abstract&quot; turn-based battle systems associated with computer RPGs. In response, he pointed out that not all console RPGs are action-based, pointing to &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Lufia&quot;. Another early criticism, dating back to the &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; games in the late 1980s, was the frequent use of defined player characters, in contrast to the &quot;Wizardry&quot; and Gold Box games where the player&#x27;s avatars (such as knights, clerics, or thieves) were blank slates.

As Japanese console RPGs became increasingly more dominant in the 1990s, and became known for being more heavily story and character-based, American computer RPGs began to face criticism for having characters devoid of personality or background, due to representing avatars which the player uses to interact with the world, in contrast to Japanese console RPGs which depicted characters with distinctive personalities. American computer RPGs were thus criticized for lacking &quot;more of the traditional role-playing&quot; offered by Japanese console RPGs, which instead emphasized character interactions. In response, North American computer RPGs began making a comeback towards the end of the 1990s with interactive choice-filled adventures.

Several writers have criticized JRPGs as not being &quot;true&quot; RPGs, for heavy usage of scripted cutscenes and dialogue, and a frequent lack of branching outcomes.[Turner] Japanese RPGs are also sometimes criticized for having relatively simple battle systems in which players are able to win by repetitively mashing buttons.[Turner] As a result, Japanese-style role-playing games are held in disdain by some Western gamers, leading to the term &quot;JRPG&quot; being held in the pejorative. Some observers have also speculated that JRPGs are stagnating or declining in both quality and popularity, including remarks by BioWare co-founder Greg Zeschuk and writing director Daniel Erickson that JRPGs are stagnating—and that &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot; is not even really an RPG; criticisms regarding seemingly nebulous justifications by some Japanese designers for newly changed (or, alternately, newly un-changed) features of recent titles; calls among some gaming journalists to &quot;fix&quot; JRPGs&#x27; problems; as well as claims that some recent titles such as &quot;Front Mission Evolved&quot; are beginning to attempt—and failing to—imitate Western titles. In an article for &quot;PSM3&quot;, Brittany Vincent of RPGFan.com felt that &quot;developers have mired the modern JRPG in unoriginality&quot;, citing Square Enix CEO Yoichi Wada who stated that &quot;they&#x27;re strictly catering to a particular audience&quot;, the article noting the difference in game sales between Japan and North America before going on to suggest JRPGs may need to &quot;move forward&quot;. This criticism has also occurred in the wider media with an advertisement for &quot;&quot; (Obsidian Entertainment) in Japan openly mocked Japanese RPGs&#x27; traditional characteristics in favor of their own title. Nick Doerr of Joystiq noted that Bethesda felt that JRPGs &quot;are all the same&quot; and &quot;too linear&quot;, to which he responded that &quot;[f]or the most part, it&#x27;s true&quot; but noted there are also non-linear JRPGs such as the &quot;Romancing SaGa&quot; series. Such criticisms have produced responses such as ones by Japanese video game developers, Shinji Mikami and Yuji Horii, to the effect that JRPGs were never as popular in the West to begin with, and that Western reviewers are biased against turn-based systems. Jeff Fleming of Gamasutra also states that Japanese RPGs on home consoles are generally showing signs of staleness, but notes that handheld consoles such as the Nintendo DS have had more original and experimental Japanese RPGs released in recent years.

Western RPGs have also received criticism in recent years. They remain less popular in Japan, where, until recently, Western games in general had a negative reputation. In Japan, where the vast majority of early console role-playing video games originate, Western RPGs remain largely unknown. The developer Motomu Toriyama criticized Western RPGs, stating that they &quot;dump you in a big open world, and let you do whatever you like [which makes it] difficult to tell a compelling story.&quot; Hironobu Sakaguchi noted that &quot;users like to categorise&quot; WRPGs as &quot;a sort of different style, born from first person shooters.&quot; In recent years, some have also criticized WRPGs for becoming less RPG-like, instead with further emphasis on action. Christian Nutt of &quot;GameSpy&quot; states that, in contrast to JRPGs, WRPGs&#x27; greater control over the development and customization of playable characters has come at the expense of plot and gameplay, resulting in what he felt was generic dialogue, lack of character development within the narrative and weaker battle systems.[Nutt] He also states that WRPGs tend to focus more on the underlying rules governing the battle system rather than on the experience itself.[Nutt] Tom Battey of &quot;Edge Magazine&quot; noted that the problems often cited against JRPGs also often apply to many WRPGs as well as games outside of the RPG genre. BioWare games have been criticized for &quot;lack of innovation, repetitive structure and lack of real choice.&quot; WRPGs, such as Bethesda games, have also been criticized for lacking in &quot;narrative strength&quot; or &quot;mechanical intricacy&quot; due to the open-ended, sandbox structure of their games.

Despite the criticisms leveled at both variations, Rowan Kaiser of Joystiq argued that many of the often mentioned differences between Eastern and Western games are stereotypes that are generally not true, noting various similarities between several Western titles (such as &quot;Lands of Lore&quot;, &quot;Betrayal at Krondor&quot;, and &quot;Dragon Age&quot;) and several classic Eastern titles (such as &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Phantasy Star&quot;), noting that both these Western and Japanese titles share a similar emphasis on linear storytelling, pre-defined characters and &quot;bright-colored&quot; graphics. The developer Hironobu Sakaguchi also noted there are many games from both that don&#x27;t fit such categorizations, such as his own &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; as well as the &quot;Mana&quot; games, noting there have been many other such Japanese role-playing games that never released in Western markets.

====Controversy====
Christianity is a minority religion in Japan and depictions of Christian symbolism and themes in Japanese media are fraught with potential controversy. This tends to be problematic when JRPGs are exported to Western countries such as the United States where the topics of religion and blasphemy remain sensitive. A JRPG can exhibit elements that would be controversial in the West, such as &quot;Xenogears&quot; or &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; featuring antagonists that bear similarities to the Abrahamic God and the Catholic Church, respectively; negative depictions of organized religions; and &quot;characters banding together and killing God.&quot; Nintendo has made efforts in the past to remove references such as these prior to introducing their games into the North American market.

== Subgenres ==
===Action RPGs===
Typically action RPGs feature each player directly controlling a single character in real-time, and feature a strong focus on combat and action with plot and character interaction kept to a minimum. Early action RPGs tended to follow the template set by 1980s Nihon Falcom titles such as the &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; and &quot;Ys&quot; series, which feature hack and slash combat where the player character&#x27;s movements and actions are controlled directly, using a keyboard or game controller, rather than using menus. This formula was refined by the action-adventure game, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; (1986), which set the template used by many subsequent action RPGs, including innovations such as an open world, nonlinear gameplay, battery backup saving, and an attack button that animates a sword swing or projectile attack on the screen. The game was largely responsible for the surge of action-oriented RPGs released since the late 1980s, both in Japan and North America. &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series would continue to exert an influence on the transition of both console and computer RPGs from stat-heavy, turn-based combat towards real-time action combat in the following decades.

A different variation of the action RPG formula was popularized by &quot;Diablo&quot; (1996), where the majority of commands—such as moving and attacking—are executed using mouse clicks rather than via menus, though learned spells can also be assigned to hotkeys. In many action RPGs, non-player characters serve only one purpose, be it to buy or sell items or upgrade the player&#x27;s abilities, or issue them with combat-centric quests. Problems players face also often have an action-based solution, such as breaking a wooden door open with an axe rather than finding the key needed to unlock it, though some games place greater emphasis on character attributes such as a &quot;lockpicking&quot; skill and puzzle-solving.

One common challenge in developing action RPGs is including content beyond that of killing enemies. With the sheer number of items, locations and monsters found in many such games, it can be difficult to create the needed depth to offer players a unique experience tailored to his or her beliefs, choices or actions. This is doubly true if a game makes use of randomization, as is common. One notable example of a game which went beyond this is &quot;Deus Ex&quot; (2000) which offered multiple solutions to problems using intricately layered story options and individually constructed environments. Instead of simply bashing their way through levels, players were challenged to act in character by choosing dialog options appropriately, and by using the surrounding environment intelligently. This produced an experience that was unique and tailored to each situation as opposed to one that repeated itself endlessly.

At one time, action RPGs were much more common on consoles than on computers. Though there had been attempts at creating action-oriented computer RPGs during the late 1980s and early 1990s, often in the vein of &quot;Zelda&quot;, very few saw any success, with the 1992 game &quot;Ultima VII&quot; being one of the more successful exceptions in North America. On the PC, &quot;Diablo&quot;&#x27;s effect on the market was significant: it had many imitators and its style of combat went on to be used by many games that came after. For many years afterwards, games that closely mimicked the &quot;Diablo&quot; formula were referred to as &quot;&quot;Diablo&quot; clones&quot;. Three of the four titles in the series were still sold together as part of the &quot;Diablo Battle Chest&quot; over a decade after &quot;Diablo&quot;&#x27;s release. Other examples of action RPGs for the PC include &quot;Dungeon Siege&quot;, &quot;Sacred&quot;, &quot;Torchlight&quot; and &quot;&quot;—the last of which was developed by a team headed by former Blizzard employees, some of whom had participated in the creation of the &quot;Diablo&quot; series. Like &quot;Diablo&quot; and &quot;Rogue&quot; before it, &quot;Torchlight&quot; and &quot;Hellgate: London&quot; made use of procedural generation to generate game levels.

Also included within this subgenre are role-playing shooters—games that incorporate elements of role-playing games and shooter games (including first-person and third-person). Recent examples include the &quot;Mass Effect&quot; series, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Borderlands 2&quot; and &quot;The 3rd Birthday&quot;.

===Dungeon Crawlers===

This subgenre consists of RPGs where the player leads a party of adventurers in first-person perspective, typically through a dungeon or labyrinth in a grid-based environment. Examples include the aforementioned &quot;Wizardry&quot;, &quot;Might and Magic&quot; and &quot;Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; series; as well as the &quot;Etrian Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Elminage&quot; series. Games of this type are sometimes called &quot;blobbers&quot;, since the player moves the entire party around the playing field as a single unit, or &quot;blob&quot;.

Most &quot;blobbers&quot; are turn-based, but some titles such as the &quot;Dungeon Master&quot;, &quot;Legend of Grimrock&quot; and &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot; series are played in real-time. Early games in this genre lacked an automap feature, forcing players to draw their own maps in order to keep track of their progress. Environmental and spatial puzzles are common, meaning players may need to, for instance, move a stone in one part of the level in order to open a gate in another part of the level.

===MMORPGs===
Though many of the original RPGs for the PLATO mainframe system in the late 1970s also supported multiple, simultaneous players, the popularity of multiplayer modes in mainstream RPGs did not begin to rise sharply until the early to mid-1990s. For instance, &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; (1993), an early action role-playing game by Square, was one of the first commercial RPGs to feature cooperative multiplayer gameplay, offering two-player and three-player action once the main character had acquired his party members. Later, &quot;Diablo&quot; (1997) would combine CRPG and action game elements with an Internet multiplayer mode that allowed up to four players to enter the same world and fight monsters, trade items, or fight against each other.

Also during this time period, the MUD genre that had been spawned by MUD1 in 1978 was undergoing a tremendous expansion phase due to the release and spread of LPMud (1989) and DikuMUD (1991). Soon, driven by the mainstream adoption of the Internet, these parallel trends merged in the popularization of graphical MUDs, which would soon become known as massively multiplayer online role-playing games or MMORPGs, beginning with games like &quot;Meridian 59&quot; (1995), &quot;&quot; (1996), &quot;Ultima Online&quot; (1997), &quot;Lineage&quot; (1998), and &quot;EverQuest&quot; (1999), and leading to more modern phenomena such as &quot;RuneScape&quot; (2001), Ragnarok Online(2002), &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; (2003), &quot;Eve Online&quot; (2003) &quot;Disney&#x27;s Toontown Online&quot; (2003) and &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; (2004).

Although superficially similar to single-player RPGs, MMORPGs lend their appeal more to the socializing influences of being online with hundreds or even thousands of other players at a time, and trace their origins more from MUDs than from CRPGs like &quot;Ultima&quot; and &quot;Wizardry&quot;. Rather than focusing on the &quot;old school&quot; considerations of memorizing huge numbers of stats and esoterica and battling it out in complex, tactical environments, players instead spend much of their time forming and maintaining guilds and clans. The distinction between CRPGs and MMORPGs and MUDs can as a result be very sharp, likenable to the difference between &quot;attending a renaissance fair and reading a good fantasy novel&quot;.

Further, MMORPGs have been criticized for diluting the &quot;epic&quot; feeling of single-player RPGs and related media among thousands of concurrent adventurers. Stated simply: every player wants to be &quot;The Hero&quot;, slay &quot;The Monster&quot;, rescue &quot;The Princess&quot;, or obtain &quot;The Magic Sword&quot;. But when there are thousands of players all playing the same game, clearly not everyone can be &quot;the&quot; hero. This problem became obvious to some in the game &quot;EverQuest&quot;, where groups of players would compete and sometimes harass each other in order to get monsters in the same dungeon to drop valuable items, leading to several undesirable behaviors such as kill stealing, spawn camping, and ninja looting. In response—for instance by Richard Garriott in &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot; (2007)—developers began turning to instance dungeons as a means of reducing competition over limited resources, as well as preserving the gaming experience—though this mechanic has its own set of detractors.

Lastly, there exist markets such as Korea and China that, while saturated with MMORPGs, have so far proved relatively unreceptive to single-player RPGs. For instance, Internet-connected personal computers are relatively common in Korea when compared to other regions—particularly in the numerous &quot;PC bangs&quot; scattered around the country, where patrons are able to pay to play multiplayer video games—possibly due to historical bans on Japanese imports, as well as a culture that traditionally sees video games as &quot;frivolous toys&quot; and computers as educational. As a result, some have wondered whether the stand-alone, single-player RPG is still viable commercially—especially on the personal computer—when there are competing pressures such as big-name publishers&#x27; marketing needs, video game piracy, a change in culture, and the competitive price-point-to-processing-power ratio (at least initially) of modern console systems.

===Roguelikes and roguelites===

Roguelike is a subgenre of role-playing video games, characterized by procedural generation of game levels, turn-based gameplay, tile-based graphics, permanent death of the player-character, and typically based on a high fantasy narrative setting. Roguelikes descend from the 1980 game &quot;Rogue&quot;, particularly mirroring &quot;Rogue&quot;s character- or sprite-based graphics. These games were popularized among college students and computer programmers of the 1980s and 1990s, leading to a large number of variants but adhering to these common gameplay elements. Some of the more well-known variants include &quot;Hack&quot;, &quot;NetHack&quot;, &quot;Ancient Domains of Mystery&quot;, &quot;Moria&quot;, &quot;Angband&quot;, and &quot;Tales of Maj&#x27;Eyal&quot;. The Japanese series of &quot;Mystery Dungeon&quot; games by Chunsoft, inspired by &quot;Rogue&quot;, also fall within the concept of roguelike games.

More recently, with more powerful home computers and gaming systems, new variations of roguelikes incorporating other gameplay genres, thematic elements and graphical styles have become popular, typically retaining the notion of procedural generation. These titles are sometimes labeled as &quot;roguelike-like&quot;, &quot;rogue-lite&quot;, or &quot;procedural death labyrinths&quot; to reflect the variation from titles which mimic the gameplay of traditional roguelikes more faithfully. Other games, like &quot;Diablo&quot; and &quot;UnReal World&quot;, took inspiration from roguelikes.

=== Sandbox RPGs ===
Sandbox RPGs, or open world RPGs, allow the player a great amount of freedom and usually feature a more open free-roaming world (meaning the player is not confined to a single path restricted by rocks or fences etc.). Sandbox RPGs possess similarities to other sandbox games, such as the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series, with a large number of interactable NPCs, large amount of content and typically some of the largest worlds to explore and longest play-times of all RPGs due to an impressive amount of secondary content not critical to the game&#x27;s main storyline. Sandbox RPGs often attempt to emulate an entire region of their setting. Popular examples of this subgenre include the &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; series by Nihon Falcom, the early &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games by Chunsoft, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; and &quot;Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&quot; by Nintendo, &quot;Wasteland&quot; by Interplay Entertainment, the &quot;SaGa&quot; and &quot;Mana&quot; series by Squaresoft, &quot;System Shock &quot; and &quot;System Shock 2&quot; by Looking Glass Studios and Irrational Games, &quot;Deus Ex&quot; by Ion Storm, &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; and &quot;Fallout&quot; series by Bethesda Softworks and Interplay Entertainment, &quot;Fable&quot; by Lionhead Studios and Playground Games, the &quot;Gothic&quot; series by Piranha Bytes, the &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles&quot; series by Monolith Soft, and the &quot;Dark Souls&quot; series by FromSoftware.

===Tactical RPGs===
This subgenre of turn-based role-playing games principally refers to games which incorporate elements from strategy games as an alternative to traditional role-playing game (RPG) systems. Tactical RPGs are descendants of traditional strategy games, such as chess, and table-top role-playing and strategic war games, such as &quot;Chainmail&quot;, which were mainly tactical in their original form. The format of a tactical CRPG is also like a traditional RPG in its appearance, pacing and rule structure. Like standard RPGs, the player controls a finite party and battles a similar number of enemies. And like other RPGs, death is usually temporary, albeit some have permanent death of party members. But this genre incorporates strategic gameplay such as tactical movement on an isometric grid. Tactical RPGs tend not to feature multiplayer play.

A number of early Western role-playing video games used a highly tactical form of combat, including parts of the &quot;Ultima&quot; series, which introduced party-based, tiled combat in &quot;Ultima III: Exodus&quot; (1983). &quot;Ultima III&quot; would go on to be ported to many other platforms and influence the development of later titles, as would &quot;Bokosuka Wars&quot; (1983), considered a pioneer in the strategy/simulation RPG genre, according to Nintendo. Conventionally, however, the term tactical RPG (known as &quot;simulation RPG&quot; in Japan) refers to the distinct subgenre that was born in Japan; as the early origins of tactical RPGs are difficult to trace from the American side of the Pacific, where much of the early RPG genre developed.

Many tactical RPGs can be both extremely time-consuming and extremely difficult. Hence, the appeal of most tactical RPGs is to the hardcore, not casual, computer and video game player. Traditionally, tactical RPGs have been quite popular in Japan but have not enjoyed the same degree of success in North America and elsewhere. However, the audience for Japanese tactical RPGs has grown substantially since the mid-90s, with PS1 and PS2 titles such as &quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot;, &quot;Suikoden Tactics&quot;, &quot;Vanguard Bandits&quot;, and &quot;Disgaea&quot; enjoying a surprising measure of popularity, as well as hand-held war games like &quot;Fire Emblem&quot;. (&quot;Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; for the PS1 is often considered the breakthrough title outside Japan.) Older TRPGs are also being re-released via software emulation—such as on the Wii Virtual Console—and on handheld game consoles, giving games a new lease on life and exposure to new audiences. Japanese video games such as these are as a result no longer nearly as rare a commodity in North America as they were during the 1990s.

Western video games have utilized similar mechanics for years, as well, and were largely defined by &quot;X-COM: UFO Defense&quot; (1994) in much the same way as Eastern video games were by &quot;Fire Emblem&quot;. Titles such as &quot;X-COM&quot; have generally allowed greater freedom of movement when interacting with the surrounding environment than their Eastern counterparts. Other similar examples include the &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot; (1994–2013) and &quot;Silent Storm&quot; (2003–2005) series. According to a few developers, it became increasingly difficult during the 2000s to develop games of this type for the PC in the West (though several had been developed in Eastern Europe with mixed results); and even some Japanese console RPG developers began to complain about a bias against turn-based systems. Reasons cited include Western publishers&#x27; focus on developing real-time and action-oriented games instead.

Lastly, there are a number of &quot;full-fledged&quot; CRPGs which could be described as having &quot;tactical combat&quot;. Examples from the classic era of CRPGs include parts of the aforementioned &quot;Ultima&quot; series; SSI&#x27;s &quot;Wizard&#x27;s Crown&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Eternal Dagger&quot; (1987); the &quot;Gold Box&quot; games of the late &#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s, many of which were later ported to Japanese video game systems; and the &quot;Realms of Arkania&quot; (1992–1996) series based on the German &quot;The Dark Eye&quot; pen-and-paper system. More recent examples include &quot;Wasteland 2&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;—all released in 2014. Partly due to the release of these games 2014 has been called &quot;the first year of the CRPG renaissance&quot;.

===Hybrid genres===
A steadily increasing number of other non-RP video games have adopted aspects traditionally seen in RPGs, such as experience point systems, equipment management, and choices in dialogue, as developers push to fill the demand for role-playing elements in non-RPGs. The blending of these elements with a number of different game engines and gameplay styles have created a myriad of hybrid game categories formed by mixing popular gameplay elements featured in other genres such as first-person shooters, platformers, and turn-based and real-time strategy games. Examples include first-person shooters such as parts of the &quot;Deus Ex&quot; (starting in 2000) and &quot;S.T.A.L.K.E.R.&quot; (starting in 2007) series; real-time strategy games such as &quot;&quot; (2003) and &quot;Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II&quot; (2009); puzzle video games such as &quot;Castlevania Puzzle&quot; (2010) and &quot;Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords&quot; (2007); and turn-based strategy games like the &quot;Steel Panthers&quot; (1995–2006) series, which combined tactical military combat with RPG-derived unit advancement. As a group, hybrid games have been both praised and criticized; being referred to by one critic as the &quot;poor man&#x27;s&quot; RPG for omitting the dialogue choices and story-driven character development of major AAA titles; and by another critic as &quot;promising&quot; for shedding the conventions of more established franchises in an attempt to innovate.

===Relationship to other genres===

RPGs seldom test a player&#x27;s physical skill. Combat is typically a tactical challenge rather than a physical one, and games involve other non-action gameplay such as choosing dialog options, inventory management, or buying and selling items.

Although RPGs share some combat rules with wargames, RPGs are often about a small group of individual characters. Wargames tend to have large groups of identical units, as well as non-humanoid units such as tanks and airplanes. Role-playing games do not normally allow the player to produce more units. However, the &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic&quot; series crosses these genres by combining individual heroes with large numbers of troops in large battles.

RPGs rival adventure games in terms of their rich storylines, in contrast to genres that do not rely upon storytelling such as sports games or puzzle games. Both genres also feature highly detailed characters, and a great deal of exploration. However, RPGs also feature a combat system, which adventure games lack. In doing so, RPGs tend to emphasize complex internal mechanics where characters are defined by increasing numerical attributes.

Gameplay elements strongly associated with this genre, such as statistical character development, have been widely adapted to other video game genres. For example, &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;, an action-adventure game, uses resource statistics (abbreviated as &quot;stats&quot;) to define a wide range of attributes including stamina, weapon proficiency, driving, lung capacity, and muscle tone, and uses numerous cutscenes and quests to advance the story.

&quot;Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos&quot;, a real-time strategy game, features heroes that can complete quests, obtain new equipment, and &quot;learn&quot; new abilities as they advance in level. A community-created mod based on &quot;Warcraft III,&quot; &quot;Defense of the Ancients (DotA),&quot; served as significant inspiration for the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) genre. Due to its &quot;Warcraft III&quot; origins, MOBA is a fusion of role-playing games, real-time strategy games, and action games, with RPG elements built in its core gameplay. A key features, such as control over one character in a party, growth in power over the course of match, learning new thematic abilities, using of mana, leveling and accumulation of experience points, equipment and inventory management, completing quests, and fighting with the stationary boss monsters, have resemblance with role-playing games.

According to Satoru Iwata, former president of Nintendo, turn-based RPGs have been unfairly criticized as being outdated, and action-based RPGs can frustrate players who are unable to keep up with the battles. According to Yuji Horii, creator of the popular &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series and Ryutaro Ichimura, producer of Square Enix, turn-based RPGs allow the player time to make decisions without feeling rushed or worry about real-life distractions.

==Popularity==
The best-selling RPG series worldwide is &quot;Pokémon&quot;, which has sold over 300 million units, with over 30 million sales for &quot;Pokémon Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, and &quot;Green&quot; alone. The second and third best-selling RPG franchises worldwide are Square Enix&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series, with over 110 million units and over 64 million units sold as of March 31, 2014, respectively. Nearly all the games in the main &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series and all the games in the main &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series (as well as many of the spin-off games) have sold over a million copies each, with some games selling more than four million copies. Square Enix&#x27;s best-selling title is &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, which has sold over 10 million copies worldwide as of 2010.

Among the best-selling PC RPGs overall is the massively multiplayer online game &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; with 11.5 million subscribers as of May 2010. Among single player PC RPGs, &quot;Diablo II&quot; has sold the largest amount, with the most recently cited number being over 4 million copies as of 2001. However, copies of the &quot;Diablo: Battle Chest&quot; continued to be sold in retail stores, with the compilation appearing on the NPD Group&#x27;s top 10 PC games sales, list as recently as 2010. Further, &quot;Diablo: Battle Chest&quot; was the 19th best-selling PC game of 2008—a full seven years after the game&#x27;s initial release; and 11 million users still played &quot;Diablo II&quot; and &quot;StarCraft&quot; over Battle.net in 2010. As a franchise, the &quot;Diablo&quot; series has sold over 20 million copies, not including &quot;Diablo III&quot; which was released for Windows and OS X in 2012.

The &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series was awarded with six world records in the 2008 &quot;Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; of the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, including &quot;Best Selling Role Playing Game on the Super Famicom&quot;, &quot;Fastest Selling Game in Japan&quot;, and &quot;First Video Game Series to Inspire a Ballet&quot;. Likewise, the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series received eight records, including &quot;Most Successful RPG Series of All Time&quot;. &quot;Diablo II&quot; was recognized in the 2000 standard edition of the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; for being the fastest selling computer game ever sold, with more than 1 million units sold in the first two weeks of availability; though this number has been surpassed several times since. A number of RPGs are also being exhibited in the Barbican Art Gallery&#x27;s &quot;Game On&quot; exhibition (starting in 2002) and the Smithsonian&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Video Games&quot; exhibit (starting in 2012); and video game developers are now finally able to apply for grants from the US National Endowment of the Arts.

According to &quot;Metacritic&quot;, as of May 2011, the highest-rated video game by reviewers is the Xbox 360 version of &quot;Mass Effect 2&quot;, with an average metascore of 96 out of 100. According to GameRankings, the four top-rated video game RPGs, as of May 2010, are &quot;Mass Effect 2&quot; with an average rating of 95.70% for the Xbox 360 version and 94.24% for the PC version; &quot;Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition&quot; with an average rating of 95.40% for the PlayStation 3 version; &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; with an average rating of 95.10%; and &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot; with an average rating of 94.18% for the Xbox version. Sales numbers for these six aforementioned titles are 10 million units sold worldwide for &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; as of May 2010; 161,161 units of &quot;Xenoblade Chronicles&quot; sold in Japan as of December 2010; 1.6 million units sold worldwide for &quot;Mass Effect 2&quot; as of March 2010, just three months after release; 4.7 million units for &quot;Fallout 3&quot; on all three platforms as of November 2008, also only a few months after publication; 3 million units for both the Xbox and PC versions of &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot; as of November 2004; and more than 2.65 million units for the SNES and PlayStation versions of &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; as of March 2003, along with 790,000 copies for the Nintendo DS version as of March 31, 2009. Among these titles, none were PC-exclusives, three were North American multi-platform titles released for consoles like the Xbox and Xbox 360, and three were Japanese titles released for consoles like the SNES, PlayStation and Wii.

&quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; topped &quot;GamePro&#x27;s&quot; &quot;26 Best RPGs of All Time&quot; list in 2008, IGN&#x27;s 2000 &quot;Reader&#x27;s Choice Game of the Century&quot; poll, and the GameFAQs &quot;Best Game Ever&quot; audience polls in 2004 and 2005. It was also selected in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Games of All Time&quot; list as the highest-ranking RPG, at #2 on the list. On IGN&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Games Of All Time&quot; list in 2007, the highest ranking RPG is &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; at 9th place; and in both the 2006 and 2008 IGN Readers&#x27; Choice polls, &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot; is the top ranked RPG, in 2nd place. &quot;Final Fantasy VI&quot; is also the top ranked RPG in &quot;Game Informer&quot;&#x27;s list of its 200 best games of all time list, in 8th place; and is also one of the eight games to get a cover for the magazine&#x27;s 200th issue. The 2006 &quot;Famitsu&quot; readers&#x27; poll is dominated by RPGs, with nearly a dozen titles appearing in the top twenty; while most were Japanese, a few Western titles also made a showing. The highest-ranking games on the list were &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, followed by &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;Dragon Warrior III&quot;. For the past decade, the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; series topped several &quot;RPGs of the Decade&quot; lists. RPGFan&#x27;s &quot;Top 20 RPGs of the Past Decade&quot; list was topped by &quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Digital Devil Saga&quot; &amp; &quot;Digital Devil Saga 2&quot; followed by &quot;Persona 3&quot;, while RPGamer&#x27;s &quot;Top RPGs of the Decade&quot; list was topped by &quot;Persona 3&quot;, followed by &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;.

Lastly, while in recent years Western RPGs have consistently been released on consoles such as the Xbox and Xbox 360, these systems have not shown as much market dominance in Eastern markets such as Japan, and only a few Western RPG titles have been localized to Japanese. Further, RPGs were not the dominant genre on the most popular of the seventh generation video game consoles, the Wii, although their presence among handheld systems such as the Nintendo DS is considerably greater.

===Notable developers===

Notable early RPG developers include Don Daglow for creating the first role-playing video game, &quot;Dungeon&quot;, in 1975; Yuji Horii for creating the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series; Hironobu Sakaguchi for creating the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series; Richard Garriott for creating the &quot;Ultima&quot; series; and Brenda Romero for writing and design work on the &quot;Wizardry&quot; series. Other notable RPG developers include Bethesda Game Studios, creators of &quot;Fallout 3&quot;, &quot;Fallout 4&quot;, and &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot; series; Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk for founding BioWare; and CD Projekt, creators of &quot;The Witcher&quot; series and &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot;. Finally, Ryozo Tsujimoto (&quot;Monster Hunter&quot; series) and Katsura Hashino (&quot;Persona&quot; series) were cited as &quot;Japanese Game Developers You Should Know&quot; by &quot;1UP.com&quot; in 2010.

===Crowdfunding===
Since 2009
there has been a trend of crowdfunding video games using services such as Kickstarter. Role-playing games that have been successfully crowdfunded include &quot;Serpent in the Staglands&quot; (2015), &quot;The Banner Saga&quot; series (2015–2018), &quot;Dead State&quot; (2014), &quot;Wasteland 2&quot; (2014),&quot; Undertale&quot; (2015), &quot;Shadowrun Returns&quot; and its sequels (2012–2015), the &quot;Pillars of Eternity&quot; series (2015–2018), the &quot;&quot; series (2014–2017) and &quot;&quot; (2017). Due to the release of &quot;Wasteland 2&quot;, &quot;Divinity: Original Sin&quot;, &quot;The Banner Saga&quot; and &quot;Dead State&quot; (as well as some more traditionally funded titles such as &quot;Might and Magic X&quot;, &quot;Lords of Xulima&quot; and &quot;The Dark Eye: Blackguards&quot;) 2014 was called &quot;the first year of the CRPG renaissance&quot; by PC Gamer. However, it has been speculated that the spike in funded projects at around this time was the result of a &quot;Kickstarter bubble&quot;, and that a subsequent slump in project funding was due to &quot;Kickstarter fatigue&quot;.

The highest crowdfunded CRPG as of May 2017 is &quot;Torment: Tides of Numenera&quot; with $4,188,927 raised via Kickstarter. Kickstarted games have been released for the personal computer, video game console, and mobile platforms.

<text>Balthasar Gérard (alternative spellings Gerards or Gerardts; c. 1557 – 14 July 1584) was the assassin of the Dutch revolt&#x27;s leader, William the Silent of the House of Orange (William the Silent, and later known as the &quot;Father of the Fatherland&quot;). He killed William the Silent in Delft on 10 July 1584, by shooting him twice with a pair of pistols, and was afterwards tried, convicted, tortured, and executed. Gérard was born in Franche-Comté (then belonging to Holy Roman Empire, afterwards to France). He came from a Roman Catholic family with 11 children and was a great admirer of Philip II, king of Spain and the Netherlands. He studied law at the University of Dole. On 15 March 1580, King Philip had offered a reward of 25,000 crowns, peerage and an inheritable estate to anyone who killed or captured William the Silent, to whom he referred in his decree as a &quot;pest on the whole of Christianity and the enemy of the human race.&quot;

==Preparations==
After the reward offered by Philip was published, Gérard left for Luxembourg, where he learned that Juan de Jáuregui had already been preparing to attempt the assassination, but this attempt did not succeed. In March 1584 he went to Trier, where he put his plan before the regent of the Jesuits, but another Jesuit convinced him to change his original scheme and go to the prince of Parma. In Tournai, after holding counsel with a Franciscan, Father Gery, Gérard wrote a letter, a copy of which was deposited with the guardian of the convent, and the original presented personally to the Prince of Parma. In the letter Gérard wrote, in part, &quot;The vassal ought always to prefer justice and the will of the king to his own life.&quot;

At first the prince thought him unfit but after consulting Haultepenne and others with the letter he was assigned to Christoffel d&#x27;Assonleville, who spoke with Gérard, and asked him to put this in writing, which he did on 11 April 1584. He requested absolution from the prince of Parma &quot;as he was about to keep company for some time with heretics and atheists, and in some sort to conform himself to their customs&quot;.

For his first expenses he begged for 50 crowns, which were refused. &quot;I will provide myself out of my own purse&quot;, Gérard told Assonleville, &quot;and within six weeks you will hear of me.&quot; Assonleville responded: &quot;Go forth, my son ... and if you succeed in your enterprise, the King will fulfill all his promises, and you will gain an immortal name besides.&quot; On Sunday, 8 July 1584, Gérard loitered in the courtyard of the Prinsenhof examining the premises. A halberdier asked him why he was waiting there. He excused himself by saying that in his present shabby clothing and without new shoes he was unfit to join the congregation in the church opposite. The halberdier unsuspectingly arranged from the Prince of Orange himself a gift of 50 crowns for Gérard, who the following morning purchased a pair of pistols from a soldier, haggling the price for a long time because the soldier could not supply the particular chopped bullets or slugs he wanted.

==The shooting==
On 10 July 1584, as William the Silent climbed the stairs to the second floor, he was spoken to by the Welsh captain Roger Williams, who knelt before him. William put his hand on the bowed head of the old captain, at which moment Gérard jumped out of a dark corner. He drew his weapons and fired two shots at the stadtholder. William the Silent collapsed. His sister knelt beside him, but it was too late. The exact story surrounding the last moments before his death are lost to history, but according to legend he was asked whether he commended his soul to Christ, he answered in the affirmative. His last words were, (&quot;My God, have mercy on me and on my poor people&quot;). The contemporary consensus among Dutch historians is that William the Silent could not have said this, as he was most likely dead at the instant he was shot. However, his legendary final words remain a part of the Dutch historical canon.

Gérard fled through a side door and ran across a narrow lane, pursued by Roger Williams. Gérard had almost reached the ramparts, from which he intended to jump into the moat. On the other side a saddled horse stood ready. A pig&#x27;s bladder around his waist was intended to help keep him afloat. However, he stumbled over a heap of rubbish. A servant and a halberdier of the prince who had raced after him caught him. When called a traitor by his captors, he is said to have replied, &quot;I am no traitor; I am a loyal servant of my lord.&quot; &quot;Which lord?&quot;, they asked. &quot;Of my lord and master, the king of Spain&quot;. At the same time more pages and halberdiers of the prince appeared and dragged him back to the house under a rain of fists and beatings with the butt of a sword. Hearing his assailants chatter and convinced he heard the prince was still alive, he cried &quot;Cursed be the hand that missed!&quot; 

The shooting is notable for being the first recorded political assassination of a head of state with a handheld firearm. After William the Silent&#x27;s murder, more than 200 years would pass until another head of state was killed by a firearm, when Gustav III, King of Sweden, was fatally wounded at a midnight masquerade in 1792.

==Trial, torture, and execution==
At the house he immediately underwent a preliminary examination before the city magistrates. Upon being interrogated by the magistrates, he reportedly showed neither despair nor contrition, but rather a quiet exultation, stating: &quot;Like David, he had slain Goliath of Gath.&quot;

At his trial, Gérard was sentenced to be tortured and then executed, in a manner considered brutal even by the standards at the time. The magistrates decreed that the right hand of Gérard should be burned off with a red-hot iron, that his flesh should be torn from his bones with pincers in six different places, that he should be quartered and disemboweled alive, his heart torn from his bosom and flung in his face, and that, finally, his head should be taken off.

Gérard&#x27;s torture was extraordinarily brutal. On the first night of his imprisonment, Gérard was hung on a pole and lashed with a whip. Next, his wounds were smeared with honey and a goat was brought to lick the honey off his skin with its rough tongue. The goat, however, refused to touch his body. After several other forms of torture, he was left to pass the night with his hands and feet bound together, like a ball, so sleep would be difficult. During the following three days, he was repeatedly mocked and hung on a pole with his hands tied behind his back. Then, a weight of 300 metric pounds (150 kg) was attached to each of his big toes for half an hour.

Subsequently, Gérard was fitted with shoes made of well-oiled, uncured dog skin; the shoes were two fingers shorter than his feet. In this state, he was put before a fire. When the shoes warmed up, they contracted, crushing the feet inside them to stumps. When the shoes were removed, his half-broiled skin was torn off. After his feet were damaged, his armpits were branded. He was then dressed in a shirt soaked in alcohol. Lastly, burning bacon fat was poured over him and sharp nails were stuck between the flesh and the nails of his hands and feet. On 14 July, four days after the assassination, the sentence declared at the trial was carried out and Gérard was tortured and executed in the market square of Delft. His severed head was then displayed on a pike behind the Prinsenhof, and his arms and legs displayed on four gates of the city.

==Aftermath==
Philip II gave Gérard&#x27;s parents, instead of the reward of 25,000 crowns, three country estates in Lievremont, Hostal, and Dampmartin in the Franche-Comté, and the family was raised to the peerage. Philip II would later offer the estates to Philip William, Orange&#x27;s son and the next Prince of Orange, provided the prince continue to pay a fixed portion of the rents to the family of his father&#x27;s murderer; the insulting offer was rejected. The estates remained with the Gérard family. The apostolic vicar Sasbout Vosmeer tried to have Gérard canonized, to which end he removed the dead man&#x27;s head and showed it to church officials in Rome, but the idea was rejected.

==Legacy==
The village of Vuillafans renamed the street where Gérard was born &quot;Rue Gérard&quot; in his memory.

<text>The Battle of Oliwa, also known as the Battle of Oliva or the Battle of Gdańsk Roadstead, was a naval battle that took place on 28 November, 1627, slightly north of the port of Gdańsk off of the coast of the village of Oliva during the Polish–Swedish War. It was the largest naval engagement to be fought by the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Navy and resulted in defeating a Swedish squadron led by Niels Stiernsköld that conducted a blockade of the harbour of Gdańsk. The Poles sailed out of the Gdańsk harbour and engaged the Swedish squadron capturing the Swedish flagship and sinking another Swedish warship.

==Background==
The Swedes had a long tradition of seamanship and maintained a strong navy, and were able to land troops from the Swedish mainland at will along the southern Baltic shore. They were also able to blockade the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth&#x27;s ports (most important being Gdańsk) maintaining a stranglehold on Polish-Lithuanian trade. On 28 November, a small, newly-formed Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth fleet, using purchased German ships and foreign (mainly Dutch) sailors, emerged from Gdańsk to defeat the Swedish blockading squadron. The admiral of the Polish fleet (at the time) was Wilhelm Appelmann, but due to illness, he could not take part in the battle and the royal commissioners appointed a new admiral of the Polish fleet before the battle. Arend Dickmann made himself the admiral of the fleet, Jan Storch made himself the commander of the Polish marines, and Herman Witte made himself the vice admiral. These three commanders formed a council of war in which they jointly developed a battle plan and decided on the attack. The galleon &quot;Ritter Sankt Georg&quot; was the Polish-Lithuanian flagship.

==Battle==
The Polish–Lithuanian fleet outnumbered the blockading Swedish squadron; the two Polish-Lithuanian squadrons numbered ten ships in all, but most were of small size, and only four Polish-Lithuanian ships were at full combat strength. The Polish–Lithuanian ships were commanded by Admiral Arend Dickmann in the &quot;Ritter Sankt Georg&quot;. The Swedish squadron numbered six vessels under Admiral Nils Stiernsköld in his flagship, &quot;Tigern&quot;. The Polish–Lithuanian ships had a larger complement of marines on board than the Swedish ships, and this in large part determined the tactics employed in the battle.

The Polish–Lithuanian fleet anchored off the Gdańsk roadstead, while the Swedish squadron sailed southwards from the Hel Peninsula. The Polish–Lithuanian squadrons weighed anchor and suddenly rushed towards the Swedish squadron, much to the surprise of the Swedes.

The battle split into two main encounters. The Polish–Lithuanian flagship &quot;Ritter Sankt Georg&quot;, supported by the &quot;Panna Wodna&quot; (Meerweib), engaged the Swedish flagship &quot;Tigern&quot;. More Polish–Lithuanian ships came alongside the &quot;Tigern&quot; and Polish–Lithuanian marines boarded, overwhelmed the Swedes, and captured the vessel. Meanwhile, the Polish–Lithuanian vice-admiral&#x27;s galleon, &quot;Wodnik&quot; (Meerman), attacked the larger Swedish galleon, &quot;Solen&quot;. The captain of the &quot;Solen&quot;, a Scotsman named Alexander Forath who served as the vice admiral of the fleet, seeing that his ship was about to be captured, detonated the powder magazine and blew his ship up rather than let it be captured. The four surviving Swedish ships realized their situation, quickly headed towards the open sea, and managed to escape the pursuit. Both admirals were killed.

After the conclusion of the battle, Arend Dickmann (known to the Poles as the Polish &quot;Nelson&quot;) died from a cannon shot that smashed his legs and appeared to be fired from the retreating Swedish ships, while the Swedish admiral Nils Stiernsköld soon died of injuries sustained during the fighting. Both admirals were buried with the highest honors in the St. Mary&#x27;s Basilica in Danzig.

==Aftermath==
The after action report on the battle for Sigismund III Vasa was prepared by Wolfgang von der Oelsnitz from the Royal Ship Commission, who also presented the king with the captured Swedish flags and the personal sword of Nils Stiernsköld. James Murray was dismissed from duty after the conclusion of the battle after allegations of cowardice surfaced from the other captains of the Polish–Lithuanian fleet over the refusal of Murray to pursue the fleeing of the Swedish ships.

The immediate effect of the battle was the temporary removal of the Swedish blockade of Gdańsk. The court of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth used the victory to the maximum advantage in their propaganda. A popular Polish saying states that on that day &quot;the sun went down at noon&quot;, referring to the destruction of one of the Swedish ships, the &quot;Solen&quot;. Gustavus received the news of this battle with some mark of impatience, and apparently little awareness of the difference between naval and land operations – he could not help expressing his surprise that a &quot;city of merchants&quot; (referring to the city of Gdańsk) should be able to dispute the sea with a professional navy.

<doc id="356782" wikidata="Q7048592" url="?curid=356782" title="Nominal watt">
<text>Nominal wattage is used to simplify the measurement of the efficiency of a loudspeaker.

The impedance of a loudspeaker varies with frequency. This means that if different sine wave tones are fed into the loudspeaker at the same voltage (or the same current), the amount of electric power consumed will vary.

By convention, loudspeakers are designed to generate the same sound pressure level (SPL) at the listener for the same voltage at varying frequencies - regardless of the variation in electric power. This permits a loudspeaker to be used with an amplifier having a low internal impedance and a flat frequency response is realized for the combined amplifier/loudspeaker system.

However, an amplifier with a low internal impedance delivers more electrical output power when the load impedance reduces (until the impedances become approximately matched). Such high power levels could cause damage to either the amplifier or the amplifier&#x27;s power supply, or the circuit connected to the amplifier&#x27;s output (including the loudspeaker).

Therefore, an additional convention exists whereby loudspeaker manufacturers specify a conservative estimate of the average impedance that the loudspeaker will present while playing typical music. This is called the &quot;nominal impedance&quot;. Amplifiers can therefore be safely specified to operate into a load that has this &quot;nominal impedance&quot; (or higher, but not lower).

Typical nominal impedances for speakers include 4, 6, 8 and 16Ω (ohms), with 4Ω being most common in in-car loudspeakers, and 8Ω being most common elsewhere. A loudspeaker with an 8Ω nominal impedance may exhibit actual impedances ranging from approximately 5 to 100Ω depending on frequency.

In this context, the nominal wattage is the &quot;theoretical&quot; electric power that &quot;would&quot; be transferred from amplifier to speaker &quot;if&quot; the loudspeaker was actually exhibiting its nominal impedance. The actual electric power may vary from about twice the nominal power down to less than one tenth.

Loudspeaker efficiency is measured with respect to nominal power in order to emulate the situation outlined above where a low internal impedance amplifier is used with a loudspeaker. The convention is to supply one nominal watt during testing. If the nominal impedance is 4 ohms, the voltage would be 2 volts. If the nominal impedance is 8Ω, the voltage would be 2.83 volts.

<text>Institutional racism, also known as systemic racism, is a form of institutional discrimination based on race or ethnic group and can include policies and practices that exist throughout a whole society or organization that result in and support a continued unfair advantage to some people and unfair or harmful treatment of others. It manifests as discrimination in areas such as criminal justice, employment, housing, healthcare, education and political representation.

The term &quot;institutional racism&quot; was first coined in 1967 by Stokely Carmichael and Charles V. Hamilton in &quot;Black Power: The Politics of Liberation&quot;. Carmichael and Hamilton wrote in 1967 that, while individual racism is often identifiable because of its overt nature, institutional racism is less perceptible because of its &quot;less overt, far more subtle&quot; nature. Institutional racism &quot;originates in the operation of established and respected forces in the society, and thus receives far less public condemnation than [individual racism]&quot;.

Institutional racism was defined by Sir William Macpherson in the UK&#x27;s Lawrence report (1999) as: &quot;The collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture, or ethnic origin. It can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes and behaviour that amount to discrimination through prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness, and racist stereotyping which disadvantage minority ethnic people.&quot;

Individual or formal equality of opportunity typically disregards systemic or institutional aspects of inequality and racism. Institutional racism could be caused by power imbalance. Combating institutional racism is a motivation for structural changes. Substantive equality with equality of outcomes for people of different races and ethnicity could be one way of preventing institutional racism. Diversity, equity, and inclusion can be applied to diminish institutional racism.

==Classification==

In the past, the term &quot;racism&quot; was often used interchangeably with &quot;prejudice&quot;, forming an opinion of another person based on incomplete information. In the last quarter of the 20th century, racism became associated with systems rather than individuals. In 1977, David Wellman defined racism as &quot;a system of advantage based on race&quot; in his book &quot;Portraits of White Racism&quot;, illustrating this definition through countless examples of white people supporting racist institutions while denying that they are prejudiced. White people can be nice to people of color while continuing to uphold systemic racism that benefits them, such as lending practices, well-funded schools, and job opportunities. The concept of institutional racism re-emerged in political discourse in the mid and late 1990s, but has remained a contested concept. Institutional racism is where race causes a different level of access to the goods, services, and opportunities of society.

Professor James M. Jones theorised three major types of racism: personally mediated, internalized, and institutionalized. Personally mediated racism includes the deliberate specific social attitudes to racially prejudiced action (bigoted differential assumptions about abilities, motives, and the intentions of others according to their race), discrimination (the differential actions and behaviours towards others according to their race), stereotyping, commission, and omission (disrespect, suspicion, devaluation, and dehumanization). Internalized racism is the acceptance, by members of the racially stigmatized people, of negative perceptions about their own abilities and intrinsic worth, characterized by low self-esteem, and low esteem of others like them. This racism can be manifested through embracing &quot;whiteness&quot; (e.g. stratification by skin colour in non-white communities), self-devaluation (e.g., racial slurs, nicknames, rejection of ancestral culture, etc.), and resignation, helplessness and hopelessness (e.g., dropping out of school, failing to vote, engaging in health-risk practices, etc.).

Persistent negative stereotypes fuel institutional racism and influence interpersonal relations. Racial stereotyping contributes to patterns of racial residential segregation and redlining, and shapes views about crime, crime policy and welfare policy, especially if the contextual information is stereotype-consistent.

Other examples sometimes described as institutional racism are racial profiling by security guards and police, use of stereotyped racial caricatures, the under- and misrepresentation of certain racial groups in the mass media, and race-based barriers to gainful employment and professional advancement. Additionally, differential access to goods, services and opportunities of society can be included within the term &quot;institutional racism&quot;, such as unpaved streets and roads, inherited socio-economic disadvantage and standardized tests (each ethnic group prepared for it differently; many are poorly prepared).

Some sociological investigators distinguish between institutional racism and &quot;structural racism&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;structured racialization&quot;). The former focuses upon the norms and practices within an institution, and the latter upon the &quot;interactions&quot; among institutions, which interactions produce racialized outcomes against non-white people. An important feature of structural racism is that it cannot be reduced to individual prejudice or to the single function of an institution.

D. C. Matthew has argued in favor of &quot;distinguishing between &#x27;intrinsic institutional racism&#x27;, which holds that institutions are racist in virtue of their constitutive features, and &#x27;extrinsic institutional racism&#x27;, which holds that institutions are racist in virtue of their negative effects.&quot;

== By country ==

=== Algeria ===
The French political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville (1805–1859) supported colonization in general, and particularly the colonization of Algeria. In several speeches on France&#x27;s foreign affairs, in two official reports presented to the National Assembly in March 1847 on behalf of an &quot;ad hoc&quot; commission, and in his voluminous correspondence, he repeatedly commented on and analyzed the issue. In short, Tocqueville developed a theoretical basis for French expansion in North Africa. He even studied the Quran, sharply concluding that Islam was &quot;the main cause of the decadence... of the Muslim world&quot;. His opinions are also instructive about the early years of the French conquest and how the colonial state was first set up and organized. Tocqueville emerged as an early advocate of &quot;total domination&quot; in Algeria and subsequent &quot;devastation of the country&quot;.

On 31 January 1830, Charles X capturing Algiers made the French state thus begin what became institutional racism directed at the Kabyle, or Berbers, of Arab descent in North Africa. The Dey of Algiers had insulted the monarchy by slapping the French ambassador with a fly-whisk, and the French used that pretext to invade and to put an end to piracy in the vicinity. The unofficial objective was to restore the prestige of the French crown and gain a foothold in North Africa, thereby preventing the British gaining advantage over France in the Mediterranean. The July Monarchy, which came to power in 1830, inherited that burden. The next ten years saw the indigenous population subjected to the might of the French army. By 1840, more conservative elements gained control of the government and dispatched General Thomas Bugeaud, the newly appointed governor of the colony, to Algeria, which marked the real start of the country&#x27;s conquest. The methods employed were atrocious; the army deported villagers &quot;en masse&quot;, massacred the men and raped the women, took the children hostage, stole livestock and harvests and destroyed orchards. Tocqueville wrote, &quot;I believe the laws of war entitle us to ravage the country and that we must do this, either by destroying crops at harvest time, or all the time by making rapid incursions, known as raids, the aim of which is to carry off men and flocks.&quot;

Tocqueville added: &quot;In France I have often heard people I respect, but do not approve, deplore [the army] burning harvests, emptying granaries and seizing unarmed men, women and children. As I see it, these are unfortunate necessities that any people wishing to make war on the Arabs must accept.&quot; He also advocated that &quot;all political freedoms must be suspended in Algeria&quot;. Marshal Bugeaud, who was the first governor-general and also headed the civil government, was rewarded by the King for the conquest and having instituted the systemic use of torture, and following a &quot;scorched earth&quot; policy against the Arab population.

The French colonial state, as he conceived it and as it took shape in Algeria, was a two-tiered organization, quite unlike the regime in Mainland France. It introduced two different political and legal systems that were based on racial, cultural and religious distinctions. According to Tocqueville, the system that should apply to the Colons would enable them alone to hold property and travel freely but would deprive them of any form of political freedom, which should be suspended in Algeria. &quot;There should therefore be two quite distinct legislations in Africa, for there are two very separate communities. There is absolutely nothing to prevent us treating Europeans as if they were on their own, as the rules established for them will only ever apply to them&quot;.

Following the defeats of the resistance in the 1840s, colonisation continued apace. By 1848, Algeria was populated by 109,400 Europeans, only 42,274 of whom were French. The leader of the Colons delegation, Auguste Warnier (1810–1875), succeeded in the 1870s in modifying or introducing legislation to facilitate the private transfer of land to settlers and continue Algeria&#x27;s appropriation of land from the local population and distribution to settlers. Europeans held about 30% of the total arable land, including the bulk of the most fertile land and most of the areas under irrigation. In 1881, the &quot;Code de l&#x27;Indigénat&quot; made the discrimination official by creating specific penalties for indigenes and by organising the seizure or appropriation of their lands. By 1900, Europeans produced more than two-thirds of the value of output in agriculture and practically all of the agricultural exports. The colonial government imposed more and higher taxes on Muslims than on Europeans. The Muslims, in addition to paying traditional taxes dating from before the French conquest, also paid new taxes from which the Colons were normally exempted. In 1909, for instance, Muslims, who made up almost 90% of the population but produced 20% of Algeria&#x27;s income, paid 70% of direct taxes and 45% of the total taxes collected. Also, Colons controlled how the revenues would be spent and so their towns had handsome municipal buildings, paved streets lined with trees, fountains and statues, but Algerian villages and rural areas benefited little, if at all, from tax revenues.

==== In education ====
The colonial regime proved severely detrimental to overall education for Muslims, who had previously relied on religious schools to learn reading, writing and religion. In 1843, the state appropriated the habus lands, the religious foundations that constituted the main source of income for religious institutions, including schools, but colonial officials refused to allocate enough money to maintain schools and mosques properly and to provide for enough teachers and religious leaders for the growing population. In 1892, more than five times as much was spent for the education of Europeans as for Muslims, who had five times as many children of school age. Because few Muslim teachers were trained, Muslim schools were largely staffed by French teachers. Even a state-operated madrasa often had French faculty members. Attempts to institute bilingual and bicultural schools, intended to bring Muslim and European children together in the classroom, were a conspicuous failure, and were rejected by both communities and phased out after 1870. According to one estimate, fewer than 5% of Algerian children attended any kind of school in 1870. As late as 1954, only one Muslim boy in five and one girl in sixteen received formal schooling. Efforts were begun by 1890 to educate a small number of Muslims along with European students in the French school system as part of France&#x27;s &quot;civilising mission&quot; in Algeria. The curriculum was entirely French and allowed no place for Arabic studies, which were deliberately downgraded even in Muslim schools. Within a generation, a class of well-educated, gallicized Muslims, the &quot;évolués&quot; (literally &quot;evolved ones&quot;), had been created.

==== Enfranchisement ====
Following its conquest of Ottoman Algeria in 1830, France maintained for well over a century its colonial rule in the territory that has been described as &quot;quasi-apartheid&quot;. The colonial law of 1865 allowed Arab and Berber Algerians to apply for French citizenship only if they abandoned their Muslim identity; Azzedine Haddour argues that it established &quot;the formal structures of a political apartheid&quot;. Camille Bonora-Waisman writes, &quot;In contrast with the Moroccan and Tunisian protectorates&quot;, the &quot;colonial apartheid society&quot; was unique to Algeria.

Under the French Fourth Republic, Muslim Algerians were accorded the rights of citizenship, but the system of discrimination was maintained in more informal ways. Frederick Cooper writes that Muslim Algerians &quot;were still marginalized in their own territory, notably the separate voter roles of &#x27;French&#x27; civil status and of &#x27;Muslim&#x27; civil status, to keep their hands on power.&quot; The &quot;internal system of apartheid&quot; was met with considerable resistance by the Algerian Muslims affected by it, and it is cited as one of the causes of the 1954 insurrection.

There was clearly nothing exceptional about the crimes committed by the French army and state in Algeria from 1955 to 1962. On the contrary, they were part of history repeating itself.

==== State racism ====
Following the views of Michel Foucault, the French historian Olivier Le Cour Grandmaison spoke of a &quot;state racism&quot; under the French Third Republic, a notable example being that the 1881 Indigenous Code applied in Algeria. Replying to the question &quot;Isn&#x27;t it excessive to talk about a state racism under the Third Republic?&quot;, he replied:
 &quot;No, if we can recognize &#x27;state racism&#x27; as the vote and implementation of discriminatory measures, grounded on a combination of racial, religious and cultural criteria, in those territories. The 1881 Indigenous Code is a monument of this genre! Considered by contemporary prestigious jurists as a &#x27;juridical monstruosity&#x27;, this code planned special offenses and penalties for &#x27;Arabs&#x27;. It was then extended to other territories of the empire. On one hand, a state of rule of law for a minority of French and Europeans located in the colonies. On the other hand, a permanent state of exception for the &quot;indigenous&quot; people. This situation lasted until 1945&quot;.

During a reform effort in 1947, the French created a bicameral legislature with one house for French citizens and another for Muslims, but it made a European&#x27;s vote worth seven times a Muslim&#x27;s vote.

=== Palestine ===

Prior to the Nakba (the mass displacement of Palestinians in 1948), the population of Palestine was around 1.9 million, with approximately 1.3 million Palestinians and 600,000 Jewish residents. By the end of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, over 750,000 Palestinians—more than half the indigenous population—had been forcibly displaced, and more than 500 villages were destroyed. Many of these refugees and their descendants, now numbering around 5.9 million, are stateless and are denied the right to return under Israeli law, despite Israel granting automatic citizenship to Jewish immigrants under the 1950 Law of Return.

Following the Nakba, Israel imposed military rule over the remaining Palestinian population inside its borders until 1966, while Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza came under Israeli occupation in 1967. Today, Palestinians in the occupied territories live under what human rights organizations—including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the United Nations—have described as an apartheid regime, characterized by racial segregation, land expropriation, and movement restrictions. Despite making up roughly 50% of the population between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, Palestinians are subject to systemic legal and political discrimination, with different legal systems applying to Jewish settlers and Palestinian residents in the same territory.

=== Australia ===
It is estimated that the population of Aboriginal peoples prior to the European colonisation of Australia (starting in 1788) was about 314,000. It has also been estimated by ecologists that the land could have supported a population of a million people. By 1901, they had been reduced by two-thirds to 93,000. In 2011, First Nations Australians (including both Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islander people) comprised about 3% of the total population, at 661,000. When Captain Cook landed in Botany Bay in 1770, he was under orders not to plant the British flag and to defer to any native population, which was largely ignored.

==== Land rights, stolen generations, and &quot;terra nullius&quot; ====

Torres Strait Islander people are indigenous to the Torres Strait Islands, which are in the Torres Strait between the northernmost tip of Queensland and Papua New Guinea. Institutional racism had its early roots here due to interactions between these islanders, who had Melanesian origins and depended on the sea for sustenance and whose land rights were abrogated, and later the Australian Aboriginal peoples, whose children were removed from their families by Australian federal and state government agencies and church missions, under acts of their respective parliaments. The removals occurred in the period between approximately 1909 and 1969, resulting in what later became known as the Stolen Generations. An example of the abandonment of mixed-race (&quot;half-caste&quot;) children in the 1920s is given in a report by Walter Baldwin Spencer that many mixed-descent children born during construction of The Ghan railway were abandoned at early ages with no one to provide for them. This incident and others spurred the need for state action to provide for and protect such children. Both were official policy and were coded into law by various acts. They have both been rescinded and restitution for past wrongs addressed at the highest levels of government.

The treatment of the First Nations Australians by the colonisers has been termed cultural genocide. The earliest introduction of child removal to legislation is recorded in the Victorian &quot;Aboriginal Protection Act 1869&quot;. The Central Board for the Protection of Aborigines had been advocating such powers since 1860, and the passage of the Act gave the colony of Victoria a wide suite of powers over Aboriginal and &quot;half-caste&quot; persons, including the forcible removal of children, especially &quot;at risk&quot; girls. By 1950, similar policies and legislation had been adopted by other states and territories, such as the &quot;Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897&quot; (Qld), the &quot;Aborigines Ordinance 1918 &quot;(NT), the &quot;Aborigines Act 1934&quot; (SA) and the &quot;1936 Native Administration Act&quot; (WA).

The child-removal legislation resulted in widespread removal of children from their parents and exercise of sundry guardianship powers by Protectors of Aborigines up to the age of 16 or 21. Policemen or other agents of the state were given the power to locate and transfer babies and children of mixed descent from their mothers or families or communities into institutions. In these Australian states and territories, half-caste institutions (both government Aboriginal reserves and church-run mission stations) were established in the early decades of the 20th century for the reception of these separated children. Examples of such institutions include Moore River Native Settlement in Western Australia, Doomadgee Aboriginal Mission in Queensland, Ebenezer Mission in Victoria and Wellington Valley Mission in New South Wales.

In 1911, the Chief Protector of Aborigines in South Australia, William Garnet South, reportedly &quot;lobbied for the power to remove Aboriginal children without a court hearing because the courts sometimes refused to accept that the children were neglected or destitute&quot;. South argued that &quot;all children of mixed descent should be treated as neglected&quot;. His lobbying reportedly played a part in the enactment of the &quot;Aborigines Act 1911&quot;; this made him the legal guardian of every Aboriginal child in South Australia, including so-called &quot;half-castes&quot;. &quot;Bringing Them Home&quot;, a report on the status of the mixed race stated &quot;... the physical infrastructure of missions, government institutions and children&#x27;s homes was often very poor and resources were insufficient to improve them or to keep the children adequately clothed, fed, and sheltered&quot;.

In reality, during this period, removal of the mixed-race children was related to the fact that most were offspring of domestic servants working on pastoral farms, and their removal allowed the mothers to continue working as help on the farm while at the same time removing the whites from responsibility for fathering them and from social stigma for having mixed-race children visible in the home. Also, when they were left alone on the farm they became targets of the men who contributed to the rise in the population of mixed-race children. The institutional racism was government policy gone awry, one that allowed babies to be taken from their mothers at birth, and this continued for most of the 20th century. That it was policy and kept secret for over 60 years is a mystery that no agency has solved to date.

In the 1930s, the Northern Territory Protector of Natives, Cecil Cook, perceived the continuing rise in numbers of &quot;half-caste&quot; children as a problem. His proposed solution was:
&quot;Generally by the fifth and invariably by the sixth generation, all native characteristics of the Australian Aborigine are eradicated. The problem of our half-castes will quickly be eliminated by the complete disappearance of the black race, and the swift submergence of their progeny in the white&quot;. He did suggest at one point that they be all sterilised.

Similarly, the Chief Protector of Aborigines in Western Australia, A. O. Neville, wrote in an article for &quot;The West Australian&quot; in 1930: &quot;Eliminate in future the full-blood and the white and one common blend will remain. Eliminate the full-blood and permit the white admixture and eventually, the race will become white&quot;.

Official policy then concentrated on removing all black people from the population, to the extent that the full-blooded Aboriginal people were hunted to extinguish them from society, and those of mixed race would be assimilated with the white race so that in a few generations they too would become white.

By 1900, the recorded First Nations Australian population had declined to approximately 93,000.

Western Australia and Queensland specifically excluded Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people from the electoral rolls. The &quot;Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902&quot; excluded &quot;Aboriginal natives of Australia, Asia, Africa and Pacific Islands except for New Zealand&quot; from voting unless they were on the roll before 1901.

==== Land rights returned ====
In 1981, a land rights conference was held at James Cook University, where Eddie Mabo, a Torres Strait Islander, made a speech to the audience in which he explained the land inheritance system on Murray Island. The significance of this in terms of Australian common law doctrine was taken note of by one of the attendees, a lawyer, who suggested there should be a test case to claim land rights through the court system. Ten years later, five months after Eddie Mabo died, on 3 June 1992, the High Court announced its historic decision, namely overturning the legal doctrine of &quot;terra nullius&quot;, which was the term applied by the British relating to the continent of Australia – &quot;empty land&quot;.

Public interest in the Mabo case had the side effect of throwing the media spotlight on all issues related to Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders in Australia, and most notably the Stolen Generations. The social impacts of forced removal have been measured and found to be quite severe. Although the stated aim of the &quot;resocialisation&quot; program was to improve the integration of Aboriginal people into modern society, a study conducted in Melbourne and cited in the official report found that there was no tangible improvement in the social position of &quot;removed&quot; Aboriginal people as compared to &quot;non-removed&quot;, particularly in the areas of employment and post-secondary education.

Most notably, the study indicated that removed Aboriginal people were actually less likely to have completed a secondary education, three times as likely to have acquired a police record and were twice as likely to use illicit drugs. The only notable advantage &quot;removed&quot; Aboriginal people possessed was a higher average income, which the report noted was most likely due to the increased urbanisation of removed individuals, and hence greater access to welfare payments than for Aboriginal people living in remote communities.

==== First Nations health and employment ====

In his 2008 address to the houses of parliament apologising for the treatment of the First Nations population, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd made a plea to the health services regarding the disparate treatment in health services. He noted the widening gap between the treatment of First Nations and non-Indigenous Australians, and committed the government to a strategy called &quot;Closing the Gap&quot;, admitting to past institutional racism in health services that shortened the life expectancy of the Aboriginal people. Committees that followed up on this outlined broad categories to redress the inequities in life expectancy, educational opportunities and employment. The Australian government also allocated funding to redress the past discrimination. First Nations Australians visit their general practitioners (GPs) and are hospitalised for diabetes, circulatory disease, musculoskeletal conditions, respiratory and kidney disease, mental, ear and eye problems and behavioural problems yet are less likely than non-Indigenous Australians to visit the GP, use a private doctor, or apply for residence in an old age facility. Childhood mortality rates, the gap in educational achievement and lack of employment opportunities were made goals that in a generation should halve the gap. A national &quot;Close the Gap&quot; day was announced for March of each year by the Human Rights Commission.

In 2011, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reported that life expectancy had increased since 2008 by 11.5 years for women and 9.7 years for men along with a significant decrease in infant mortality, but it was still 2.5 times higher than for the non-indigenous population. Much of the health woes of the First Nations Australians could be traced to the availability of transport. In remote communities, the report cited 71% of the population in those remote Fist Nations communities lacked access to public transport, and 78% of the communities were more than from the nearest hospital. Although English was the official language of Australia, many First Nations Australians did not speak it as a primary language, and the lack of printed materials that were translated into the Australian Aboriginal languages and the non-availability of translators formed a barrier to adequate health care for Aboriginal people. By 2015, most of the funding promised to achieve the goals of &quot;Closing the Gap&quot; had been cut, and the national group monitoring the conditions of the First Nations population was not optimistic that the promises of 2008 will be kept. In 2012, the group complained that institutional racism and overt discrimination continued to be issues, and that, in some sectors of government, the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was being treated as an aspirational rather that a binding document.

=== United Arab Emirates ===
Systemic racism in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is primarily manifested through its kafala (sponsorship) system, which governs migrant labor, as well as through citizenship policies that favor the native Emirati population while marginalizing expatriates and stateless groups such as the Bidoon. Human rights organizations have documented widespread racial and ethnic discrimination in employment, legal rights, and social mobility, disproportionately affecting South Asian, African, and Southeast Asian migrant workers, who make up the majority of the country’s population. The kafala system has been widely criticized as a form of modern-day slavery due to its restrictions on workers’ rights and its potential for abuse. As of 2020, an estimated 90% of the UAE’s workforce consists of migrant laborers, predominantly from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and the Philippines.

The UAE’s citizenship laws heavily favor native Emiratis, who make up only 11% of the total population but receive state subsidies, free healthcare, and government jobs. Meanwhile, long-term residents—many of whom have lived in the country for generations—are effectively barred from citizenship. Palestinians, Syrians, and Sudanese nationals face particular barriers to residency and employment, often denied the same legal protections afforded to Western expatriates.

Western expatriates—especially white Europeans and Americans—are often treated with leniency in the country&#x27;s legal system, while South Asian and African workers receive disproportionately harsh punishments, including flogging and the death penalty for crimes that would result in lighter sentences for Emiratis or Westerners.

=== Canada ===
==== Indigenous Canadians ====
The living standard of indigenous peoples in Canada falls far short of those of the non-indigenous, and they, along with other &#x27;visible minorities&#x27; remain, as a group, the poorest in Canada. There continue to be barriers to gaining equality with other Canadians of European ancestry. The life expectancy of First Nations people is lower; they have fewer high school graduates, much higher unemployment rates, nearly double the number of infant deaths and significantly greater contact with law enforcement. Their incomes are lower, they enjoy fewer promotions in the workplace and as a group, the younger members are more likely to work reduced hours or weeks each year.

Many in Europe during the 19th century (as reflected in the Imperial Report of the Select Committee on Aborigines), supported the goal put forth by colonial imperialists of &#x27;civilizing&#x27; the Native populations. This led to an emphasis on the acquisition of Aboriginal lands in exchange for the putative benefits of European society and their associated Christian religions. British control of Canada (the Crown) began when they exercised jurisdiction over the first nations and it was by Royal Proclamation that the first piece of legislation the British government passed over First Nations citizens assumed control of their lives. It gave recognition to the Indians tribes as First Nations living under Crown protection.

It was after the treaty of Paris in 1763, whereby France ceded all claims in present-day Canada to Britain, that King George III of Great Britain issued a Royal Proclamation specifying how the Indigenous in the crown colony were to be treated. It is the most significant pieces of legislation regarding the Crown&#x27;s relationship with Aboriginal people. This Royal Proclamation recognized Indian owned lands and reserved to them all use as their hunting grounds. It also established the process by which the Crown could purchase their lands, and also laid out basic principles to guide the Crown when making treaties with the First Nations. The Proclamation made Indian lands transferred by treaty to be Crown property, and stated that indigenous title is a collective or communal rather than a private right so that individuals have no claim to lands where they lived and hunted long prior to European colonization.

==== Indian Acts ====
In 1867, the British North America Act made land reserved for Indians a Crown responsibility. In 1876 the first of many Indian Acts passed, each successive one leeched more from the rights of the indigenous as was stated in the first.
The sundry revised Indian Acts (22 times by 2002) solidified the position of Natives as wards of the state, and Indian agents were given discretionary power to control almost every aspect of the lives of the indigenous. It then became necessary to have permission from an Indian agent if Native people wanted to sell crops they had grown and harvested, or wear traditional clothes off the reserves. The Indian Act was also used to deny Indians the right to vote until 1960, and they could not sit on juries.

In 1885, General Middleton after defeating the Metis rebellion introduced the Pass System in western Canada, under which Natives could not leave their reserves without first obtaining a pass from their farming instructors permitting them to do so. While the Indian Act did not give him such powers, and no other legislation allowed the Department of Indian Affairs to institute such a system, and it was known by crown lawyers to be illegal as early as 1892, the Pass System remained in place and was enforced until the early 1930s. As Natives were not permitted at that time to become lawyers, they could not fight it in the courts. Thus was institutional racism externalized as official policy.

When Aboriginals began to press for recognition of their rights and to complain of corruption and abuses of power within the Indian department, the Act was amended to make it an offence for an Aboriginal person to retain a lawyer for the purpose of advancing any claims against the crown.

==== Métis ====

Unlike the effect of those Indian treaties in the North-West, which established the reserves for the Indigenous, the protection of Métis lands was not secured by the scrip policy instituted in the 1870s, whereby the crown exchanged a scrip in exchange for a fixed (160–240 acres) grant of land to those of mixed heritage.

Although Section 3 of the 1883 Dominion Lands Act set out this limitation, this was the first mention in the orders-in-council confining the jurisdiction of scrip commissions to ceded Indian territory. However, a reference was first made in 1886 in a draft letter of instructions to Goulet from Burgess. In most cases, the scrip policy did not consider Métis ways of life, did not guarantee their land rights, and did not facilitate any economic or lifestyle transition. 

Most Métis were illiterate and did not know the value of the scrip, and in most cases sold them for instant gratification due to economic need to speculators who undervalued the paper. Needless to say, the process by which they applied for their land was made deliberately arduous.

There was no legislation binding scrip land to the Métis who applied for them, Instead, Métis scrip lands could be sold to anyone, hence alienating any Aboriginal title that may have been vested in those lands. Despite the evident detriment to the Métis, speculation was rampant and done in collusion with the distribution of scrip. While this does not necessarily preclude a malicious intent by the federal government to consciously &#x27;cheat&#x27; the Métis, it illustrates their apathy towards the welfare of the Métis, their long-term interests, and the recognition of their Aboriginal title. But the point of the policy was to settle land in the North-West with agriculturalists, not keep a land reserve for the Métis. Scrip, then, was a major undertaking in Canadian history, and its importance as both an Aboriginal policy and a land policy should not be overlooked as it was an institutional &#x27;policy&#x27; that discriminated against ethnic indigenous to their continued detriment.

====Enfranchisement====

Until 1951, the various Indian Acts defined a &#x27;person&#x27; as &quot;an individual other than an Indian&quot;, and all indigenous peoples were considered wards of the state. Legally, the Crown devised a system of enfranchisement whereby an indigenous person could become a &quot;person&quot; in Canadian law. Indigenous people could gain the right to vote and become Canadian citizens, &quot;persons&quot; under the law, by voluntarily assimilating into European/Canadian society.

It was hoped that indigenous peoples would renounce their native heritage and culture and embrace the &#x27;benefits&#x27; of civilized society. Indeed, from the 1920s to the 1940s, some Natives did give up their status to receive the right to go to school, vote or drink. However, voluntary enfranchisement proved a failure when few natives took advantage.

In 1920, a law was passed to authorize enfranchisement without consent, and many Aboriginal peoples were involuntarily enfranchised. Natives automatically lost their Indian status under this policy and also if they became professionals such as doctors or ministers, or even if they obtained university degrees, and with it, they lost their right to reside on the reserves.

The enfranchisement requirements particularly discriminated against Native women, specifying in Section 12 (1)(b) of the Indian Act that an Indian status woman marrying a non-Indian man would lose her status as an Indian, as would her children. In contrast non-Indian women marrying Indian men would gain Indian status. Duncan Campbell Scott, the Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs, neatly expressed the sentiment of the day in 1920:
&quot;Our object is to continue until there is not a single Indian in Canada that has not been absorbed into the body politic, and there is no Indian question and no Indian Department&quot;
This aspect of enfranchisement was addressed by passage of Bill C-31 in 1985, where the discriminatory clause of the Indian Act was removed, and Canada officially gave up the goal of enfranchising Natives.

====Residential schools====
In the 19th and 20th centuries, the Canadian federal government&#x27;s Indian Affairs Department officially encouraged the growth of the Indian residential school system as an agent in a wider policy of assimilating Native Canadians into European-Canadian society. This policy was enforced with the support of various Christian churches, which ran many of the schools. Over the course of the system&#x27;s existence, approximately 30% of Aboriginal children, roughly some 150,000, were placed in residential schools nationally, with the last school closing in 1996. There has long been controversy about the conditions experienced by students in the residential schools. While day schools for First Nations, Metis and Inuit children always far outnumbered residential schools, a new consensus emerged in the early 21st century that the latter schools did significant harm to Aboriginal children who attended them by removing them from their families, depriving them of their ancestral languages, undergoing forced sterilization for some students, and by exposing many of them to physical and sexual abuse by staff members, and other students, and dis-enfranchising them forcibly.

With the goal of civilizing and Christianizing Aboriginal populations, a system of &#x27;industrial schools&#x27; was developed in the 19th century that combined academic studies with &quot;more practical matters&quot; and schools for Natives began to appear in the 1840s. From 1879 onward, these schools were modelled after the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania, whose motto was &quot;Kill the Indian in him and save the man&quot;. It was felt that the most effective weapon for &quot;killing the Indian&quot; in them was to remove children from their Native supports and so Native children were taken away from their homes, their parent, their families, friends and communities.
The 1876 Indian Act gave the federal government responsibility for Native education and by 1910 residential schools dominated the Native education policy. The government provided funding to religious groups such as the Catholic, Anglican, United Church and Presbyterian churches to undertake Native education. By 1920, attendance by natives was made compulsory and there were 74 residential schools operating nationwide. Following the ideas of Sifton and others like him, the academic goals of these schools were &quot;dumbed down&quot;. As Duncan Campbell Scott stated at the time, they did not want students that were &quot;made too smart for the Indian villages&quot;:
&quot;To this end the curriculum in residential schools has been simplified and the practical instruction given is such as may be immediately of use to the pupil when he returns to the reserve after leaving school.&quot;

The funding the government provided was generally insufficient and often the schools ran themselves as &quot;self-sufficient businesses&quot;, where &#x27;student workers&#x27; were removed from class to do the laundry, heat the building, or perform farm work. Dormitories were often poorly heated and overcrowded, and the food was less than adequately nutritious. A 1907 report, commissioned by Indian Affairs, found that in 15 prairie schools there was a death rate of 24%. Indeed, a deputy superintendent general of Indian Affairs at the time commented:
&quot;It is quite within the mark to say that fifty percent of the children who passed through these schools did not benefit from the education which they had received therein.&quot;
While the death rate did decline in later years, death would remain a part of the residential school tradition. The author of that report to the BNA, Dr. P.H. Bryce, was later removed and in 1922 published a pamphlet that came close to calling the governments indifference to the conditions of the Indians in the schools &#x27;manslaughter&#x27;.

Anthropologists Steckley and Cummins note that the endemic abuses – emotional, physical, and sexual – for which the system is now well known for &quot;might readily qualify as the single-worst thing that Europeans did to Natives in Canada&quot;. Punishments were often brutal and cruel, sometimes even life-threatening or life-ending. Pins were sometimes stuck in children&#x27;s tongues for speaking their Native languages, sick children were made to eat their vomit, and semi-formal inspections of children&#x27;s genitalia were carried out. The term Sixties Scoop (or Canada Scoops) refers to the Canadian practice, beginning in the 1960s and continuing until the late 1980s, of taking (&quot;scooping up&quot;) children of Aboriginal peoples in Canada from their families for placing in foster homes or adoption.

Most residential schools closed in the 1970s, with the last one closing in 1996. Criminal and civil suits against the government and the churches began in the late 1980s and shortly thereafter the last residential school closed. By 2002, the number of lawsuits had passed 10,000. In the 1990s, beginning with the United Church, the churches that ran the residential schools began to issue formal apologies. In 1998, the Canadian government issued the Statement of Reconciliation, and committed $350 million in support of a community-based healing strategy to address the healing needs of individuals, families and communities arising from the legacy of physical and sexual abuse at residential schools. The money was used to launch the Aboriginal Healing Foundation.

Starting in the 1990s, the government started a number of initiatives to address the effects of the Indian residential school. In March 1998, the government made a Statement of Reconciliation and established the Aboriginal Healing Foundation. In the fall of 2003, the Alternative Dispute Resolution process was launched, which was a process outside of court providing compensation and psychological support for former students of residential schools who were physically or sexually abused or were in situations of wrongful confinement. On 11 June 2008, Prime Minister Stephen Harper issued a formal apology on behalf of the sitting Cabinet and in front of an audience of Aboriginal delegates. A Truth and Reconciliation Commission ran from 2008 through to 2015 to document past wrongdoing in the hope of resolving conflict left over from the past. The final report concluded that the school system amounted to cultural genocide.

====Contemporary situation====
The overt institutional racism of the past has clearly had a profoundly devastating and lasting effect on visible minorities and Aboriginal communities throughout Canada. European cultural norms have imposed themselves on Native populations in Canada, and Aboriginal communities continue to struggle with foreign systems of governance, justice, education, and livelihood. Visible Minorities struggle with education, employment and negative contact with the legal system across Canada.

Perhaps most palpable is the dysfunction and familial devastation caused by residential schools. Hutchins states; &quot;Many of those who attended residential schools have been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, suffering from such symptoms as panic attacks, insomnia, and uncontrollable or unexplainable anger. Many also suffer from alcohol or drug abuse, sexual inadequacy or addiction, the inability to form intimate relationships, and eating disorders. Three generations of Native parents lost out on learning important parenting skills usually passed on from parent to child in caring and nurturing home environments, and the abuse suffered by students of residential schools has begun a distressing cycle of abuse within many Native communities.&quot; The lasting legacy of residential schools is but only one facet of the problem.

The Hutchins report continues: &quot;Aboriginal children continue to struggle with mainstream education in Canada. For some Indian students, English remains a second language, and many lack parents with sufficient education themselves to support them. Moreover, schooling in Canada is based on an English written tradition, which is different from the oral traditions of the Native communities. For others, it is simply that they are ostracised for their &#x27;otherness&#x27;; their manners, their attitudes, their speech, or a hundred other things which mark them out as different.
&quot;Aboriginal populations continue to suffer from poor health. They have seven years less life expectancy than the overall Canadian population and almost twice as many infant deaths. While Canada as a nation routinely ranks in the top three on the United Nations Human Development Index, its on-reserve Aboriginal population, if scored as a nation, would rank a distant and shocking sixty-third.&quot;

As Perry Bellegarde National Chief, Assembly of First Nations, points out, racism in Canada today is, for the most part, a covert operation. Its central and most distinguishing tenet is the vigour with which it is consistently denied. There are many who argue that Canada&#x27;s endeavors in the field of human rights and its stance against racism have only resulted in a &quot;more politically correct population who have learnt to better conceal their prejudices&quot;. In effect, the argument is that racism in Canada is not being eliminated, but rather is becoming more covert, more rational, and perhaps more deeply imbedded in our institutions.

That racism is alive is evidenced by the recent referendum in British Columbia by which the provincial government is asking the white majority to decide on a mandate for negotiating treaties with the Indian minority. The results of the referendum will be binding, the government having legislatively committed itself to act on these principles if more than 50% of those voting reply in the same way. Moreover, although it has been revised many times, &quot;the Indian Act remains legislation which singles out a segment of society based on race&quot;. Under it, the civil rights of First Nations peoples are &quot;dealt with in a different manner than the civil rights of the rest of Canadian citizens&quot;.
The Aboriginal Justice Inquiry in Manitoba, the Donald Marshall Inquiry in Nova Scotia, the Cawsey Report in Alberta and the Royal Commission of Aboriginal People all agree, as far as Aboriginal people are concerned, racism in Canadian society continues institutionally, systematically, and individually.

In 2020, after the death of Joyce Echaquan, the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, recognized a case of systemic racism.

In 2022, Pope Francis visited Canada for a week-long tour called a “pilgrimage of penance.” Vatican officials called the trip a “penitential pilgrimage”. The Pope was welcomed in Edmonton, where he apologized for Indigenous abuse which took place in the 20th century at Catholic-run residential schools, which have since closed. During his stay, he met with Indigenous groups to address the scandal of the residential schools. “I am sorry,” The Pope said, and asked forgiveness for the church and church members in “projects of cultural destruction and forced assimilation” and the systematic abuse and erasure of indigenous culture in the country’s residential schools.

==== Anti-Chinese immigration laws ====
The Canadian government passed the Chinese Immigration Act of 1885, levying a $50 head tax upon all Chinese people immigrating to Canada. When the 1885 act failed to deter Chinese immigration, the Canadian government then passed the Chinese Immigration Act, 1900, increasing the head tax to $100, and, upon that act failing, passed the Chinese Immigration Act, 1904, increasing the head tax (landing fee) to $500, equivalent to $8,000 in 2003 – when compared to the head tax – Right of Landing Fee and Right of Permanent Residence Fee – of $975 per person, paid by new immigrants in 1995–2005 decade, which then was reduced to $490 in 2006.

The Chinese Immigration Act, 1923, better known as the &quot;Chinese Exclusion Act&quot;, replaced prohibitive fees with a ban on ethnic Chinese immigrating to Canada – excepting merchants, diplomats, students, and &quot;special circumstance&quot; cases. The Chinese who entered Canada before 1923 had to register with the local authorities and could leave Canada only for two years or less. Since the Exclusion Act went into effect on 1 July 1923, Chinese-Canadians referred to Canada Day (Dominion Day) as &quot;Humiliation Day&quot;, refusing to celebrate it until the Act&#x27;s repeal in 1947.

==== Black Canadians ====
=== China ===
Institutional racism exists in many domains in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, though certain scholars have noted the Chinese government&#x27;s portrayal of racism as a Western problem, while intentionally ignoring or downplaying the existence of widespread systemic racism in China.

The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination reported in 2018 that Chinese law does not define racial discrimination.

==== Local ethnic minorities ====

===== Uyghurs =====

Under the leadership of Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping, the Uyghurs – a mostly Muslim ethnic minority group living in the Chinese Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region – have faced widespread persecution from authorities and mass detentions. Since 2017, it has been reported that at least one million Uyghur Muslims have been detained in so-called &quot;re-education camps&quot; commonly described as concentration camps, where they have been subject to torture, forced labor, religious discrimination, political indoctrination and other human rights abuses. Testimonials from escaped inmates have indicated inmates are subject to forced sterilization. In many cases, they are forced to work for mass-manufacturing industries such as fast-fashion companies such as Shein and Temu. It regarded as the violation of the Uyghur Forced Labour Prevention Act, which bans the utilization of cotton from Xinjiang in imported clothing if it is not guaranteed as employing equally paid workers.

Birth rates in two Xinjiang regions have dropped by more than 60% between 2015 and 2018, a result of measures by the Chinese government to lower the Uyghur population artificially. The situation has been described as an ongoing genocide by numerous sources, and others have argued that it is likely the &quot;largest mass detention of a religious minority group&quot; since the Holocaust according to the &quot;New Statesman&quot;. A study from 2013 found local government officials in China &quot;were 33 percent less likely to provide assistance to citizens with ethnic Muslim names than to ethnically-unmarked peers.&quot;

===== Tibetans =====

Since the People&#x27;s Republic of China gained control of Tibet in 1951, there has been institutional racism in the form of an elaborate propaganda system designed by the Chinese Communist Party to portray Tibetans as being liberated from serfdom through China and Han Chinese culture. A state-organized historical opera performed in 2016 in China portrayed Tibet as being unsophisticated prior to Princess Wencheng&#x27;s marriage to Songtsen Gampo, a Tibetan emperor, in the year 641. This propaganda is described by Tibetan activist Tsering Woeser as being a &quot;...vast project that rewrites history and &#x27;wipes out&#x27; the memory and culture of an entire people.&quot;

A 1991 journal article identified how forced abortion, sterilization and infanticide in Tibet were all part of a severe CCP birth-control program in the region, which was designed specifically to target Tibetans.

A paper submitted to the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination by the Tibetan government in exile stipulates about how Tibetans face an education system which is inequitable compared with the education for Han Chinese. According to the paper, only about nine percent of Chinese adults are illiterate, compared with about sixty percent of Tibetans in the Tibetan Autonomous Region. Furthermore, Tibetan children are prevented from learning about their own history and culture, and forbidden to learn their own language. Schools in the region often have racial segregation based on ethnic characteristics, with Tibetan students receiving worse education in poorly-maintained classrooms.

During the 2008 Tibet protests, a local eyewitness claimed Chinese military police &quot;were grabbing monks, kicking and beating them&quot; after riots around the closure of the Sera monastery near Lhasa.

==== Anti-African sentiment ====
Racism against African people or people perceived to be of African descent has long been documented in China.

Published in 1963, African student Emmanuel Hevi&#x27;s &quot;An African Student in China&quot; details &quot;the arrests of Chinese girls for their friendships with Africans, and particularly, Chinese feelings of racial superiority over black Africans.&quot; One notable instance was the Nanjing anti-African protests of 1988, in which African university students were the subject of racist beatings and other attacks. In some cases, Chinese university students shouted racist slogans such as Down with the black devils!&#x27; and &#x27;Blood for blood! Despite these obvious instances of racism against Africans, the Chinese state media portrayed the attacks as being instigated by the African students.

In modern China, racism remains an issue in certain universities, such as the state-funded Zhejiang Normal University. A black graduate student described how &quot;African students would hear Professors and classmates make xenophobic comments, such as &#x27;Africans are draining our scholarship funds and how African students, despite having higher grades, were receiving lower level scholarship funds through the ZJNU&#x27;s three-tiered scholarship system than their classmates.

One study noted how Africans were being portrayed as &quot;waste&quot; and &quot;triple illegals&quot; through racial profiling by police in Guangzhou. In 2007, African nationals were targeted in Beijing&#x27;s Sanlitun district by police during an anti-drug raid. They were the victims of police brutality and targeted on the basis of their skin color, something which the police later denied.

State media reports from 2008 referred to Africans in a racist manner, as Cheng explains: &quot;...[the] language often remained demeaning regarding Africans as much less civilized people. Chinese words such as 部落 (buluo, &quot;tribes&quot;) or 聚居地/ 群居/群落 (jujudi/qunju/qunluo, habitats), instead of 社区 (shequ, community) were often used to refer to Africans.&quot;

Yinghong Cheng asserts in a 2011 journal article that &quot;Cyber racism against Africans is certainly not the only racial thinking but it is perhaps the most explicit and blatant one.&quot; He details the ubiquity of &quot;manifestations of racial stereotypes, hierarchy perception and insensitivity&quot;, in addition to how &quot;systematic discourse of race has developed in much more articulate, sophisticated and explicit ways in education and pop culture to accommodate contemporary Chinese nationalism.&quot; The adoption of a more state capitalist form of government in the PRC has led to the widespread internet popularity of commercialized Chinese singers and songwriters, some of whose material is racial in subject matter. As Cheng notes: The Yellow Race&#x27; (Huangzhongren 黄种人) and &#x27;Yellow&#x27; (Huang 黄), [were] created in 2006 and 2007 respectively and dedicated to China&#x27;s hosting of the Olympics. The racist language in these songs, such as &#x27;the Yellow Race is now marching on the world,&#x27; combined with nationalist claims such as &#x27;After 5,000 years, finally it is the time for us to show up on the stage,&#x27; coloured Xie&#x27;s popularity among his young Chinese fans.&quot; 

In 2018, CCTV New Year&#x27;s Gala, a state media television programme which has in the past been viewed by up to 800 million people included a racist neocolonial skit featuring a Chinese actress who wore blackface makeup. The skit &quot;praises Chinese-African cooperation, showing how much Africans benefit from Chinese investment and how grateful they are to Beijing.&quot; Later the same year, the &quot;Daily Monitor&quot; reported that citizens of Uganda and Nigeria were discriminated against in Guangzhou by the Chinese government, through incidents such as taxis being halted and passports from African countries being confiscated, as well as hotels and restaurants being ordered to erect notices banning service to Africans. In addition, some African-owned stores were forcibly shut down.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple instances of systemic racism against African people were documented, including misinformation and racist stereotyping which portrayed Africans as carriers of the virus. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Africans were &quot;refused entry by hospitals, hotels, supermarkets, shops and food outlets. At one hospital, even a pregnant woman was denied access. In a McDonald&#x27;s restaurant, a notice was put up saying &#x27;black people cannot come in. The local government in Guangzhou implemented mass surveillance, compulsory testing, and enforced a 14-day quarantine for all African nationals, regardless of whether they had traveled outside of China in the past two weeks.

==== Anti-Japanese sentiment ====

Anti-Japanese sentiment exists as a modern issue in China, largely due to historical grievances. There have been reports of restaurants and public institutions refusing service or entry to Japanese people, which stems especially due to the Second Sino-Japanese War which had included Japanese war crimes such as the Nanjing massacre and Unit 731.

Japanese goods have also been boycotted in China more than ten times within a year. The official people lead citizens to do boycotts which exacerbates the situation.

There is an Uotsuri Island, which is part of the controversial island in the East China, called as Senkaku Island in Japan and Diaoyu Island in China. On September 15, 2012, there were huge Chinese demonstrators of anti-Japanese protest outside the Japanese Embassy in Beijing, China.

In recent years, there has been joint communiqués between the leaders of these two countries to try and mend as well as improve relations with each other.
=== Malaysia ===
Malaysians of Chinese and Indian descent – who make up a significant portion of ethnic minorities in Malaysia, with them making up around 23.2% and 7.0% of the population respectively – were granted citizenship by the Malaysian Constitution but this implied a social contract that left them at a disadvantage and discriminated in other ways, as Article 153 of the Constitution of Malaysia refers to the special &quot;position&quot; and &quot;privileges&quot; of the Muslim Malay people as supposed initial dwellers of the land.

==== Malay supremacy ====
However, due to the concept of &quot;Ketuanan Melayu&quot; (lit. Malay supremacy), citizens who are not considered to be of Bumiputera status face many roadblocks and discrimination in matters such as economic freedom, education, healthcare and housing. Opposition groups, government critics and human rights observers have labeled the Malaysian situation as being highly similar to apartheid policies due to the &quot;de facto&quot; status of some as second-class citizens. Such policies have also led to a significant brain drain from the country.

In 1970, the Malaysian New Economic Policy, a program of affirmative action aimed at increasing the share of the economy held by the Malay population, introduced quotas for Malays in areas such as public education, access to housing, vehicle imports, government contracts and share ownership. Initially meant as a measure to curb the poor economic participation of the Malays (aimed to reduce the number of Malays in significant poverty), it is now perceived by most conservative Malays as a form of entitlement or &#x27;birthright&#x27;. In post-modern Malaysia, this entitlement in political, legislative, monarchic, religious, education, social, and economic areas has led to lower productivity and lower competitiveness among the Malays.

As for the elite Malays, this &#x27;privilege&#x27; has been abused to the point where the poor Malays remain poor, while the rich Malays becomes richer; which is the result of Malay cronyism, non-competitive and non-transparent government project tender processes favouring Bumiputera candidates – causing deeper intra-ethnic inequality. However, the actual indigenous people (better known as Orang Asli) remain marginalised and have their rights ignored by the Malaysian government. Since Article 160 defines a Malay as &quot;professing the religion of Islam&quot;, those eligible to benefit from laws assisting &quot;bumiputra&quot; are, in theory, subject to religious law enforced by the parallel Syariah Court system.

While 179 countries around the world have ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), Malaysia is not one of them. The Pakatan Harapan (PH) government that replaced Barisan Nasional (BN) from 2018 to 2020 had indicated a readiness to ratify ICERD, but did not, possibly due to the convention&#x27;s conflict with the Malaysian constitution and the racial and religious norms in Malaysia established since its independence. Furthermore, a mass rally was held in 2018 by Malay supremacists at the country&#x27;s capital to prevent such ratification, threatening racial conflicts if they do so. The PH government would eventually lose power amid the 2020–2022 Malaysian political crisis to BN.

=== Nigeria ===

==== Indigeneity ====
Nigeria contains over 250 ethnic groups, but the country is politically dominated by three major ethnic groups – the Hausa-Fulani of the north, the Igbo of the southeast, and the Yoruba of the southwest. National politics in Nigeria have largely revolved around competition between the three dominant ethnic groups, with the minority ethnic groups having less political representation.

The Nigerian constitution promises equality among all ethnic groups, but in actuality, the concept of &quot;indigeneity&quot; is widespread across local and state governments (and to a lesser extent, the federal government), which has been criticized by Human Rights Watch as a form of discrimination and a violation of international human rights law. Citizens are recognized as &quot;indigenes&quot; of a particular locality if they belong to an ethnic group that is considered to be indigenous to that locality. Citizens from other ethnic groups, regardless of how long they or their families have been living in a locality, are legally recognized as non-indigenes and they face discrimination from government laws that limit their socioeconomic mobility.

Public universities in Nigeria favour indigenes during the admissions process, and non-indigenes are subject to discriminatory admissions policies that attempt to limit the number of non-indigene students. Non-indigene students are required to pay higher tuition and they are denied academic scholarships. Non-indigenes are often unable to participate in local politics and they are also excluded from government jobs. In some cases, non-indigenes have faced mass purges from government jobs in order to create more jobs for indigenes.

Human Rights Watch has claimed the indigeneity policies relegate &quot;millions of Nigerians to the status of second-class citizens&quot;. Nigerian Vice President Yemi Osinbajo compared indigeneity policies to apartheid.

==== Niger Delta ethnic minorities ====
Nigeria is an oil-rich country where much of its oil resources can be found in the Niger Delta region, which is inhabited by ethnic minorities such as the Ogoni and Ijaw. The native inhabitants of the Niger Delta do not receive much of the wealth generated by Nigeria&#x27;s vast oil industry, and it is, paradoxically, one of Nigeria&#x27;s poorest regions. Oil wealth has been used to develop other parts of Nigeria while the Niger Delta region itself remains underdeveloped. The Niger Delta is constantly polluted and destroyed by the activities of both the Nigerian government and oil companies such as Shell Nigeria and Chevron Nigeria. Struggle for oil wealth has fueled violence in the Niger Delta, causing the militarization of nearly the entire region by ethnic militia groups and Nigerian military and police forces.

The Ijaw and Ogoni people have been subject to human rights violations in the form of environmental destruction and pollution. A 1979 amendment to the Nigerian constitution gave the federal government the authority to seize and distribute Ogoni territory to oil companies without any compensation. In 1990, the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People was founded by Ogoni activist Ken Saro-Wiwa to seek self-determination for the Ogoni people, compensation for environmental destruction, and payment of royalties from oil production. In 1995, he was arrested and executed, along with nine other Ogoni activists, by the regime of the Nigerian military dictator Sani Abacha, which was internationally condemned as a violation of human rights.

While the Nigerian government has become more democratic ever since the death of Sani Abacha, the ethnic groups in the Niger Delta still lack representation and remain excluded from the mainstream of Nigerian politics, economy and society. Government security forces in the Delta region regularly engage in torture, killings and confiscation of property as a result of the Conflict in the Niger Delta. The Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization condemned the Nigerian government for its discrimination against the Ogoni people and failure to clean environmental pollution from the Niger Delta region.

==== Osu ====

The Igbo people traditionally maintain a system of discrimination from the Odinani religion that discriminates against a class of people known as &quot;Osu&quot; (Igbo: outcast). Osu are regarded to be spiritually inferior beings, and they are distinguished from &quot;Nwadiala&quot; or &quot;diala&quot; (Igbo: real born). They are ostracized from wider society and Igbo are discouraged from marrying them. They were historically either sold into slavery or were delivered to be enslaved to certain deities who were believed to ask for human sacrifice during festivals in order to clean the land from abomination, thus leading to the purchase of a slave by the people.

The status of &quot;Osu&quot; is permanent and inherited at birth. Despite influence from colonialism and Christianity, discrimination against Osu still persists in the modern day. In modern times, Osu are often barred from marriage, traditional leadership positions, and running from political office.

According to some human rights groups who are calling for its abolishment, some of the punishments meted out against the &quot;Osu&quot; include: parents administering poison to their children, disinheritance, ostracism, denial of membership in social clubs, violent disruption of marriage ceremonies, denial of chieftaincy titles, deprivation of property and expulsion of wives.

=== South Africa ===
In South Africa, during apartheid, institutional racism has been a powerful means of excluding from resources and power any person not categorized or marked as a white. Those marked as black were further discriminated against differentially, with Africans facing more extreme forms of exclusion and exploitation than those marked as Coloured or Indian. One such example of institutional racism in South Africa is Natives Land Act, 1913, which reserved 90% of land for white use and the Native Urban Areas Act of 1923 controlled access to urban areas, which suited commercial farmers who were keen to hold labour on their land. Africans, who formed the majority of the population, were relegated to (often barren) rural reserves, which later became homelands.

More modern forms of institutional racism in South Africa are centered around interracial relationships and official government policy. Opposition to interracial intimate relationships may be indicative of underlying racism, and that conversely acceptance and support of these relationships may be indicative of a stance against racism. Even though the prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act was repealed in 1985, the term &quot;mixed&quot; continued to exists, thus carrying forth the inherent stigmatization of &quot;mixed&quot; relationships and race. Consequently, discourse is a framework that realizes that language can produce institutional structures and relations. However, language constitutes who we are, how we interact with others and how we understand ourselves. Therefore, discourse is said to be inextricably linked to power and more than just a medium used to transmit information.

Furthermore, post-apartheid racism is still rife in South Africa, both black-on-white and white-on-black, with white-on-black racism being more advertised in the news. In 2015, black staff at a restaurant near Stellenbosch allegedly were verbally attacked and degraded by a group of white students. In response, a black student declared that everyone who did not speak Afrikaans in the area was an alien in the area. &quot;They were whistling at them as they were whistling at dogs,&quot; he claimed. He further claimed that the white students even leapt over the counter and patted them as if they were dogs. Three white men and four other young white men allegedly followed him outside after he left the restaurant and assaulted him. The University of Stellenbosch did not continue with disciplinary action which shows the racism in academic institutions.

The South African government has done things to combat racial economic disparity in South Africa for example, BEE (Black Economic Empowerment) is a South African government programme aimed at facilitating black people&#x27;s fuller participation in the economy, particularly to address imbalances established by apartheid. It offers incentives to businesses that contribute to black economic empowerment through a variety of measurable criteria, such as partial or majority black ownership, hiring black employees, and contracting with black-owned suppliers, as well as preferential treatment in government procurement processes. BEE&#x27;s preferential procurement feature has been hailed as a model for a long-term procurement strategy in which government procurement is used to accomplish social policy goals.

=== United Kingdom ===
==== In the Metropolitan Police Service ====

In the United Kingdom, the inquiry about the murder of the black Briton Stephen Lawrence concluded that the investigating police force was institutionally racist. Sir William Macpherson used the term as a description of &quot;the collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture, or ethnic origin&quot;, which &quot;can be seen or detected in processes, attitudes, and behaviour, which amount to discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance, thoughtlessness, and racist stereotyping, which disadvantages minority ethnic people&quot;. Sir William&#x27;s definition is almost identical to Stokely Carmichael&#x27;s original definition some forty years earlier. Stokely Carmichael and Charles Hamilton were Black Power activists and first used the term &#x27;institutional racism&#x27; in 1967 to describe the consequences of a societal structure that was stratified into a racial hierarchy that resulted in layers of discrimination and inequality for minority ethnic people in housing, income, employment, education and health (Garner 2004:22).

The Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Report, and the public&#x27;s response to it, were among the major factors that forced the Metropolitan Police to address its treatment of ethnic minorities. More recently, the former Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Ian Blair said that the British news media are institutionally racist, a comment that offended journalists, provoking angry responses from the media, despite the National Black Police Association welcoming Blair&#x27;s assessment.

The report also found that the Metropolitan Police was institutionally racist. A total of 70 recommendations for reform were made. These proposals included abolishing the double jeopardy rule and criminalising racist statements made in private. Macpherson also called for reform in the British Civil Service, local governments, the National Health Service, schools, and the judicial system, to address issues of institutional racism.

In June 2015, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said there was some justification in claims that the Metropolitan Police Service is institutionally racist.

In March 2023, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley said that while he accepted the diagnosis of Louise Casey, Baroness Casey of Blackstock&#x27;s review, he would not use the term institutional racism, saying that it was ambiguous and politicised.

==== In criminal convictions ====
In the English and Welsh prison system, government data that was compiled in 2020 showed that youths of color are disproportionally subject to punishment that the UN regards as violating the Mandela Rules on the treatment of prisoners. The COVID-19 pandemic had caused some minors being held in pre-trial detention to be placed in solitary confinement indefinitely. Minorities under 18 comprised 50% of the youth inmates held and 27% of the overall prison population. Ethnic minorities made up 14% of the overall population.

==== In healthcare ====
Institutional racism exists in various aspects of healthcare, from maternity to psychiatric. Black women are four times more likely to die in pregnancy, labour and up to a year postpartum than whites.

Asian women are twice as likely as whites to die in pregnancy. Black women are twice as likely to have a stillborn baby than whites.

According to the Institute for the Study of Academic Racism, scholars have drawn on a 1979 work by social psychologist Michael Billig – &quot;Psychology, Racism, and Fascism&quot; – that identified links between the Institute of Psychiatry and racist/eugenic theories, notably in regard to race and intelligence, as for example promoted by IOP psychologist Hans Eysenck and in a highly publicised talk in August 1970 at the IOP by American psychologist Arthur Jensen. Billig concluded that &quot;racialist presuppositions&quot; intruded into research at the Institute both unintentionally and intentionally. In 2007, the BBC reported that a &quot;race row&quot; had broken out in the wake of an official inquiry that identified institutional racism in British psychiatry, with psychiatrists, including from the IOP/Maudsley, arguing against the claim, while the heads of the Mental Health Act Commission accused them of misunderstanding the concept of institutional racism and dismissing the legitimate concerns of the black community in Britain. Campaigns by voluntary groups seek to address the higher rates of sectioning, overmedication, misdiagnosis and forcible restraint on members of minority groups. According to 2014 statistics, black adults had the lowest treatment rate of any ethnic group, at 5.2%. The treatment rate for whites is 17.3%. Figures from March 2019 show that black people were more than four times as likely as white people to be detained under the Mental Health Act in the previous year.

Black men were 4.2 times more likely, and black women were 4.3 times more likely, to die from COVID-19 than whites during the initial wave of the pandemic.

==== In education ====

In a 2009 report by the Department for Innovations and Business Skills, it was found that black students were the most likely to receive under-predicted grades by their teachers. It was found that 8.1% of black students received higher actual grades compared to 4.6% of white students, 6.5% of Asian students and 6.1% of mixed-race students.

Critics contend that part of the institutional racism in education in the UK is in the curriculum. Arguments for and against decolonizing the curriculum are outlined on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Moral Maze&quot; podcast.

==== In employment ====
The equality and human rights commission reported that black workers with degrees earned 27.1% less income on average than whites. This gives some light for the reasons behind the stark inequalities that black people and to a lesser extent, other ethnic minorities face in the UK. For example, 56% of families with a black household head were living in poverty compared to 13% of families led by a white person.

Standards of employment in the UK, as well as in the United States and other Western European countries, often disregard how certain standards, such as eye contact, have different meanings around the world. Asian, Latin American and African cultures can consider eye contact as disrespect or as challenging authority, often resulting in them maintaining an on-and-off eye contact to show respect in interviews and employment processes. Opposingly, most people in countries in North America and Western Europe see eye contact as expressing enthusiasm and trust.

==== In the airports ====
Implementing the e-Gate system, the UK divides people by their nationalities into two groups at the airports. The system itself is practical and effective to avoid congestions and long queues. However, it is also the fact that people from certain countries such as Romania and China were disturbed and put under a special attention.

<text>L&#x27;italiana in Algeri (; The Italian Girl in Algiers) is an operatic &quot;dramma giocoso&quot; in two acts by Gioachino Rossini to an Italian libretto by Angelo Anelli, based on his earlier text set by Luigi Mosca. It premiered at the Teatro San Benedetto in Venice on 22 May 1813. The music is characteristic of Rossini&#x27;s style, remarkable for its fusion of sustained, manic energy with elegant, pristine melodies.

==Composition history==
Rossini wrote &quot;L&#x27;italiana in Algeri&quot; when he was 21. Rossini stated that he composed the opera in 18 days, though other sources claim that it took him 27 days. Rossini entrusted the composition of the recitatives as well as the aria &quot;Le femmine d&#x27;Italia&quot; to an unknown collaborator. The opera is notable for Rossini&#x27;s mixing of opera seria style with opera buffa. The overture is widely recorded and performed today, known for its distinct opening of slow, quiet pizzicato basses, leading to a sudden loud burst of sound from the full orchestra. This &quot;surprise&quot; reflects Rossini&#x27;s early admiration for Joseph Haydn, whose Symphony No. 94 in G major, &quot;The Surprise Symphony&quot;, is so named for the same shocking and semi-comic effect.

==Performance history==
The work was first performed at the Teatro San Benedetto, Venice on 22 May 1813. It was a notable success and Rossini made progressive changes to the work for later performances in Vicenza, Milan and Naples, during the following two years.

The opera was first presented in London at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre on 28 January 1819 and on 5 November 1832 in New York. It fell somewhat out of favour as the 19th century progressed, but notable performances were presented from the 1920s in &quot;Turin (1925), Rome (1927) and London (1935)&quot; and it has been revived frequently since World War II with many successful productions. In the 21st century, Rossini’s opera continues to be performed regularly.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==

:Place: Algiers
:Time: The past

===Act 1===
&quot;The palace of the Bey of Algiers&quot;
Elvira accompanied by her slave Zulma regrets the loss of the love of her husband, the Turkish Bey Mustafà. Left alone with Haly (since the Italian &#x27;h&#x27; is silent, this corresponds to the name Ali, more familiar in the English-speaking world), Captain of the Corsairs, Mustafà reveals his plan to marry Elvira off to Lindoro, his Italian slave. The Bey is bored with his submissive harem, desiring a new challenge to his virility: he wants an Italian girl, and Haly must find one! Lindoro enters alone and sings about Isabella, his true love (&quot;Languir per una bella&quot;). Mustafà comes in to explain Lindoro&#x27;s impending marriage. The enthusiastic Bey describes the attractions of the match, while Lindoro struggles to refuse (&quot;Se inclinassi a prender moglie&quot;).

&quot;The seashore&quot;

A ship has been wrecked in a storm. Its passengers include Isabella, in search of Lindoro, and Taddeo, her travelling companion and would-be lover. Isabella enters with a sorrowful cavatina &quot;Cruda sorte! Amor tiranno!&quot;, however she is not afraid (&quot;Già so per pratica&quot;) and will master the situation. Haly and his men take them prisoner. She passes off Taddeo as her uncle. Haly is delighted to learn she is an Italian – exactly what the Bey wanted! Left to consider their fate, Isabella is irritated by Taddeo&#x27;s jealousy of Lindoro (&quot;Ai capricci della sorte&quot;), but they resolve to join forces.

&quot;The palace&quot;

Back in the palace, Lindoro and Elvira do not wish to marry, but Mustafà offers Lindoro passage on a ship returning to Italy if he takes Elvira. Lindoro agrees, admitting a vague possibility of marrying her in Italy. Haly enters with news of the arrival of the Italian beauty. Mustafà is elated (&quot;Già d&#x27;insolito ardore nel petto agitare&quot;).

Surrounded by eunuchs (&quot;Viva, viva il flagel delle donne&quot;), Mustafà receives Isabella in a grand hall. He is enchanted, though she is rather amused by his appearance (&quot;Oh! Che muso, che figura!&quot;). At that moment, Lindoro, Elvira and Zulma arrive to say goodbye to Mustafà (&quot;Pria di dividerci da voi, Signore&quot;). Lindoro and Isabella are astonished to come face to face. Recovering herself, Isabella asks about Elvira, learning she is Mustafà&#x27;s ex-wife, who is being sent away to Italy, where she is to marry Lindoro.  Isabella demands that Mustafà allow Elvira (and therefore Lindoro) to remain in Algiers, telling Mustafà that he does not know how to love (&quot;Voi non sapete amar&quot;). Mustafà capitulates to Isabella&#x27;s insistence. The act ends with an ensemble of confusion (&quot;Confusi e stupidi&quot;).

===Act 2===
&quot;In the palace&quot;

Elvira and Zulma note Isabella&#x27;s skill with men. Mustafà reveals his strategy for seducing Isabella: he installs Lindoro as Isabella&#x27;s servant and his informer, and Taddeo will also be induced to help. Elvira and Zulma must tell Isabella he is coming to take coffee with her.

Isabella and Lindoro are alone. He explains that he had no intention of marrying Elvira. They agree to escape together and Lindoro sings of his happiness (&quot;Ah come il cor di giubilo&quot;). Mustafà enters with a reluctant Taddeo, acclaimed by the Turks as &quot;Lord Kaimakan&quot; (&quot;Viva il grande Kaimakan&quot;). He dislikes interceding with Isabella for the Bey, but is frightened to refuse (&quot;Ho un gran peso sulla testa&quot;).

&quot;In her apartment&quot;

Isabella is dressing in Turkish style. Zulma and Elvira deliver Mustafà&#x27;s message: he is coming for coffee. Isabella orders three cups. Elvira should wait in a side room. As Mustafà approaches, Isabella sings a romantic cavatina, &quot;Per lui che adoro&quot; – she will receive him. Mustafà tells Taddeo to leave when he sneezes (&quot;Ti presento di mia man&quot;). Isabella greets Mustafà warmly and he sneezes, but Taddeo ignores the signal. Isabella calls for coffee and then – to Mustafà&#x27;s horror and amazement – invites Elvira to join them.

&quot;Elsewhere in the palace&quot;

Haly sings in praise of the women of Italy (&quot;Le femmine d&#x27;Italia&quot;). The Italians enter, and Taddeo reveals to a surprised Lindoro that he is not her uncle but her lover (he himself is unaware of the other man&#x27;s true identity). Lindoro tells Mustafà that Isabella will declare him her adored &quot;pappataci&quot; (&quot;sandfly,&quot; literally &quot;silent eater&quot;: a man unable to resist the opposite sex). This, as Lindoro explains (&quot;Pappataci! Che mai sento!&quot;), is an Italian custom and a great honour, as the &quot;pappataci&quot; enjoy an idyllic life dedicated to eating, drinking and sleeping. Zulma and Haly speculate about Isabella&#x27;s real intentions and the quantity of alcohol ordered for the ceremony.

&quot;Isabella&#x27;s apartment&quot;

She addresses the Italian slaves who will be &quot;pappataci&quot; in the ceremony – she will lead them to freedom (&quot;Pensa alla patria&quot;). The ceremony begins (&quot;Dei pappataci s&#x27;avanza il coro&quot;); Mustafà is delighted with his new honour and changes into appropriate costume. Isabella explains his obligations. He must swear an oath of eating, drinking, and keeping silent, repeating the words after Taddeo. Following that his oath is tested, under provocation by Isabella and Lindoro.

A European ship docks near the palace, signaling the moment to escape. Taddeo finally realizes Lindoro’s true identity but chooses to go along with the plan regardless. Elvira, Zulma, and Haly discover that the Bey is still behaving like a confused &quot;pappataci.&quot; Regaining his senses, Mustafà attempts to summon his troops, only to find them all drunk. The Italians make their escape, while Mustafà pleads for Elvira&#x27;s forgiveness, vowing to avoid Italian women in the future.

<text>François Cheng (; born 30 August 1929) is a Chinese-born French academician, writer, poet, and calligrapher. He is the author of essays, novels, collections of poetry and books on art written in the French language, and the translator of some of the great French poets into Chinese.

== Biography ==
Born in Nanchang, Jiangxi in 1929, Cheng travelled to France in 1948 at the age of nineteen. In his 2002 speech to the Académie française, Cheng said, 
&quot;I became a Frenchman in law, mind and heart more than thirty years ago [...] especially from that moment when I resolutely went over to the French language, making it the weapon, or the soul, of my creative work. This language, how can I say everything that I owe to it? It is so intimately bound up with the way I live and my inner life that it has proved to be the emblem of my destiny.&quot;

Cheng&#x27;s first works were academic studies about Chinese poetry and painting. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he worked with the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan on studying and translating texts from the classical Chinese canon. These exchanges informed Lacan&#x27;s late teaching on psychoanalytic interpretation. Later he began to write poems in French, before finally turning to the writing of novels.

Cheng won the 1998 Prix Femina for his novel &quot;Le Dit de Tianyi&quot; (&quot;The Tale of Tianyi&quot;) (Albin Michel, Paris, 1998). In 2002 he was elected to the Académie française, the first person of Asian origin to be so honoured. Since 2008, he has been a member of the Fondation Chirac&#x27;s honour committee.

===Marriage and family===
Cheng married a painter who was also a Chinese national. They became French citizens and had a family. Their daughter Anne Cheng, born in Paris in 1955, also became an academic and sinologist.

<doc id="356820" wikidata="Q649026" url="?curid=356820" title="USL Second Division">
<text>The USL Second Division (commonly referred to as USL-2) was a professional men&#x27;s soccer league in the United States, operated by United Soccer Leagues (USL). It was at the third tier of soccer in the United States, behind Major League Soccer (top tier) and the USL First Division (second tier), and one step up from the USL Premier Development League and other leagues in the fourth tier.

==History==
In 1995 the United States Interregional Soccer League (USISL), the de facto second tier of American soccer at the time, the league changed its name to the United States International Soccer League, and split into two leagues, one professional and one amateur. The professional league, initially called the USISL Pro League, was a FIFA-sanctioned Division 3 league, while the amateur league, (the &#x27;Premier League&#x27;), was given Division 4 status and would later go on to become the USL Premier Development League. The first champions of the new USISL Pro League were the Long Island Rough Riders, who beat Minnesota Thunder 2–1 in the championship game.

In 1996, the USISL established a new USISL Select League. The strongest USISL Pro League teams joined this new league, which was given Division 2 status alongside the existing A-League, while the remainder of the teams (plus expansion teams) remained at Division 3 level. Charleston Battery became the league&#x27;s second champions in this year, beating the Charlotte Eagles in a penalty shootout in the 1996 USISL Pro League championship game.

In 1997 the league changed its name to the USISL D-3 Pro League to further distinguish itself from the A-League, and then in 1999 the umbrella USISL changed its name to the United Soccer Leagues (USL), and as such the Pro League officially became known as the USL D3 Pro League. In 2003 the name was changed again to the USL Pro Select League, but during the season had to be changed to the USL Pro Soccer League for to legal reasons. In 2005 the league took its final name as the USL Second Division.

The USL Second Division dissolved following the 2010 season to make way for USL Pro, which combined the existing USL First and Second divisions and began play in 2011.

<text>Green River was an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1984. Considered one of the first grunge bands, Green River is best known for being the precursor to multiple key early 1990s rock bands, most notably Pearl Jam, Mudhoney, Mother Love Bone, Temple of the Dog, and Love Battery. Green River reunited for several live shows in 2008 and 2009.

==History==
In its first practice sessions in early 1984, Green River&#x27;s members were vocalist Mark Arm, guitarist Steve Turner, drummer Alex Vincent (also known as Alex Shumway) and bassist Jeff Ament. Prior to joining Green River, they had played for a variety of rock, punk, and hardcore groups, often with overlapping lineups. Arm and Turner had played together in Mr. Epp and the Calculations and the Limp Richerds. Determined to start a new band together, they first recruited Vincent, whom Turner had briefly played with in Spluii Numa, as drummer, and then set about convincing Ament to join. He and Turner worked at the same Seattle coffeeshop, and Arm had befriended him after a DJ set by Ament at Metropolis, a local club. Ament had a low opinion of Mr. Epp, but agreed to join the new band due to Turner&#x27;s persistence and Ament&#x27;s frustration with Deranged Diction, his band at the time. The first Green River rehearsal was at the Turner home on Mercer Island. Stone Gossard, a high school friend of Turner and Vincent, joined as a second guitarist shortly thereafter.

The idea for the name &quot;Green River&quot; came to both Arm and Turner independently. Arm has cited several possible inspirations — a local community college, the 1969 Creedence Clearwater song — but the most resonant association was with the Green River Killer, an infamous Washington state serial killer who was prominent in headlines at the time. To Alice Wheeler, a band photographer, the name reflected undercurrents of depression and danger that would come to characterize grunge; Turner later came to see it as &quot;a dumb joke.&quot;

On June 23, 1984, Green River recorded their first demos at Reciprocal Recording. They were released on vinyl in 2016. By late 1984, the band was playing shows in and around Seattle. The band began production in December 1984 on its first record, &quot;Come on Down&quot;. By the time the band finished the record in mid-1985, Turner had left the group, citing his distaste with the rest of the band&#x27;s heavy metal leanings. He was replaced by former Deranged Diction guitarist Bruce Fairweather.

In late 1985, the band embarked on its first nationwide tour to promote &quot;Come on Down&quot;. Release of the record was delayed, however, thus negating the purpose of the tour. From all accounts the experience was less than positive, though it helped cement alliances with other emerging American indie rock bands. Among them was Sonic Youth, who later quoted the song &quot;Come on Down&quot; on its own composition &quot;Nevermind (What Was It Anyway)&quot;. After the tour, &quot;Come on Down&quot; was finally released by the New York-based Homestead Records. The record was released to little fanfare, and did not sell well. However it is often considered the first record to be released by a &quot;grunge&quot; band, as it predated both the &quot;Melvins&quot; debut EP and the &quot;Deep Six&quot; compilation album.

In 1986, the band continued to play in and around the Pacific Northwest to steadily larger crowds (especially in the band&#x27;s hometown of Seattle). Early in the year, the now legendary &quot;Deep Six&quot; compilation album was released on the local C/Z Records label. Alongside two Green River songs, the compilation features the music of fellow Washington bands Malfunkshun, Melvins, Skin Yard, Soundgarden, and The U-Men. Kathleen C. Fennessy of AllMusic stated that the compilation &quot;documents a formative period in Northwest rock history&quot;.

In June 1986, the band began production on its second EP, &quot;Dry as a Bone&quot;, with local producer Jack Endino. Green River chose to record &quot;Dry as a Bone&quot; for Bruce Pavitt&#x27;s new label, Sub Pop. However, Pavitt couldn&#x27;t afford to release it until the following year, and, as had happened with &quot;Come on Down&quot;, the record was delayed. In the meantime the band issued the one-off &quot;Together We&#x27;ll Never&quot; single on the local Tasque Force Records label. &quot;Dry as a Bone&quot; was finally released through Sub Pop in July 1987, a full year after it was recorded. It was the new label&#x27;s first non-compilation release. &quot;Dry as a Bone&quot; was promoted by Sub Pop as &quot;ultra-loose GRUNGE that destroyed the morals of a generation&quot;. Steve Huey of AllMusic called it Green River&#x27;s &quot;strongest individual release...perfecting their sleazy, raucous fusion of &#x27;70s hard rock and post-hardcore punk&quot;.

Almost immediately following the release of &quot;Dry as a Bone&quot;, the group re-entered the studio to begin production on its first full-length album, &quot;Rehab Doll&quot;. Band in-fighting, though, took center stage over the music. A stylistic division developed between Ament and Gossard on one side, and Arm on the other. Ament and Gossard wanted to pursue a major-label deal, while Arm wanted to remain independent, viewing the duo as being too careerist. The in-fighting came to a head following an October 1987 show in Los Angeles, California. Apparently, without informing the group, Ament had filled the show&#x27;s guest list with major label representatives, instead of the band&#x27;s friends; nonetheless only two of the representatives appeared. On October 31, 1987, Ament, Gossard and Fairweather stated their desire to quit the band. Although the band members agreed to complete production of &quot;Rehab Doll&quot; during the next three months, Green River had by late October 1987 ceased as a band. &quot;Rehab Doll&quot; was released in June 1988. Ned Raggett of AllMusic called it &quot;a record that sounded caught somewhere between grunge mania and metal/corp rock folly&quot;.

===Reunions===

A Green River reunion occurred on November 30, 1993 during a Pearl Jam concert in Las Vegas, Nevada. Participating in the reunion were Arm, Turner, Gossard, Ament and Chuck Treece, who filled in on drums for Vincent, who at that time was living in Japan. The band performed the songs &quot;Swallow My Pride&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Nothing to Do&quot; before leaving the stage. Green River reunited for four shows in 2008, featuring all six of its members from the 1980s. The first show was a warm-up show on July 10, 2008 at the Sunset Tavern in Seattle. The band next played on July 13, 2008 at Marymoor Park near Seattle to honor Sub Pop&#x27;s 20th anniversary.

<text>The United Soccer League (USL) is a governing body that organizes a number of professional and amateur soccer leagues in the United States league system. It currently organizes its Championship, League One, and League Two for men, its Super League and W League for women, and the USL Academy and USL Youth for youth players. It also organizes the USL Cup, a league cup competition for its professional men&#x27;s clubs.

The USL began in 1986 as a men&#x27;s indoor soccer minor league, before branching out into outdoor soccer in 1989. After rebranding as the United States Interregional Soccer League (USISL), it commenced a women&#x27;s outdoor league (the W-League) and split its men&#x27;s outdoor league into two pro and one amateur league over the course of 1995–96. Its top pro flight would merge with the American Professional Soccer League to become the A-League in 1997 – a decision influenced by the advent of Major League Soccer (MLS). Its indoor league folded in 1998. The USISL adopted its current name, the USL, in 1999. 

In 2011, a number of USL clubs broke away to form the North American Soccer League, necessitating the merger of its two pro leagues into one. The USL also took ownership of the Major Indoor Soccer League, though it and the W-League would fold by 2015. Despite these setbacks, the USL experienced growth in the late 2010s, leading to a split of the professional leagues back into two in 2019. It also revived the W League and established a pro women&#x27;s league over the course of 2022–24. A third men&#x27;s pro league, tenatively named USL Division One, is currently being planned for a 2027–28 debut.

The Rochester Rhinos men&#x27;s team and Pali Blues women&#x27;s team are the most successful clubs in the USL, having won four championships each in its top flights. Two USL clubs, the Rochester Rhinos and the Richmond Kickers, have won the men&#x27;s U.S. Open Cup. Seven men&#x27;s clubs that played in the USL – the Seattle Sounders, Portland Timbers, Vancouver Whitecaps, Montreal Impact, Orlando City SC, FC Cincinnati, and Nashville SC – are now MLS franchises.

==History==

The United Soccer League (USL) traces its roots to 1985 when Francisco Marcos founded the Southwest Indoor Soccer League. Initially intended as a minor indoor league associated with the Major Indoor Soccer League, it began with five teams owned by operators of indoor soccer arenas in the Southwest United States. By 1986, Marcos&#x27; own team, the Austin Sockadillos, joined the league, expanding it to six teams.

In 1989, the league shifted its focus beyond semi-professional indoor soccer. A press release from that year revealed ambitions to align with the United States Soccer Federation (USSF)&#x27;s plan to professionalize soccer in the lead-up to the 1994 FIFA World Cup. The league aimed to become part of a structured, three-tiered system envisioned by the USSF. 

By 1990, the league began with their first outdoor soccer competitions, and rebranded as the Sunbelt Independent Soccer League, reflecting broader ambitions. Throughout the 1990s, the league underwent significant changes. This included splitting out an amateur Premier League in 1995 (renamed to the Premier Development League (PDL) in 1997), and the launch of their first attempt at a women&#x27;s league. A merger with the American Professional Soccer League was completed in 1997 to form the A-League (later named the USL First Division), solidifying its position in the U.S. soccer pyramid. 

In 2009, several USL First Division clubs expressed dissatisfaction with the league&#x27;s leadership and structure, leading to a significant split. These clubs formed a breakaway competition called the North American Soccer League (NASL), which aimed to operate as a separate second division under the USSF. This division sparked disputes over sanctioning rights between the USL and the NASL. In response, the USSF organized a temporary combined league in 2010 before officially sanctioning the NASL as a separate entity. 

In 2010, the USL unified its First Division and Second Division under the name USL Pro to consolidate its professional competitions, and moved down to the third division. In 2013, USL Pro and Major League Soccer (MLS) entered a partnership to integrate their competitions, enhancing player development and strengthening the league&#x27;s professional status. The W-League folded in 2015. Second division sanctioning was once again granted by USSF in 2017. In 2019, the professional league rebranded to USL Championship, the PDL rebranded as USL League Two, and a new division three league named USL League One was launched.

In recent years, the USL has expanded its reach significantly in the women&#x27;s game. It reintroduced the W League in 2022 to support women&#x27;s development and launched the USL Super League in 2024 as a Division I professional women&#x27;s league alongside the National Women&#x27;s Soccer League.

On February 13, 2025, the USL announced plans to launch a Division I league in 2027 that would exist apart from MLS, pending USSF approval. They also re-stated their desire to eventually introduce a promotion and relegation system like most other global soccer leagues.

==Competitions==

=== Men&#x27;s competitions ===
The USL operates three divisions within the U.S. soccer pyramid for men&#x27;s professional and developmental teams:

* USL Championship: The second division of professional soccer in the United States, sanctioned by the United States Soccer Federation. It includes a regular season and playoffs to determine the league champion.

* USL League One: The third division of professional soccer, launched in 2019 to focus on smaller markets and player development. It also features a regular season and playoffs.

* USL League Two: A developmental league primarily for collegiate players aspiring to go professional. It operates during the summer and provides a platform for scouting and talent development.

=== Women&#x27;s competitions ===

* USL Super League: A professional league launched in 2024, with joint top-tier status within women&#x27;s soccer.

* USL W League: A pre-professional women&#x27;s league reintroduced in 2022 to create a pathway for collegiate players and young talent.

=== Former competitions ===

The USL has a history of organizing leagues and competitions that have since evolved or ceased operations:

* USL First Division: The former top-tier league operated by the USL until 2010, when it was restructured into the USL Pro (now USL Championship).

* USL Second Division: Operated as a lower-level professional league until 2010, when its teams were absorbed into other USL leagues.

* Southwest Indoor Soccer League: The USL&#x27;s original indoor competition, established in 1986. It provided a platform for amateur and semi-professional teams in the Southwest United States.

* Sunbelt Independent Soccer League (Indoor Division): After expanding into outdoor soccer in 1990, the league continued operating indoor divisions to maintain year-round competition. The indoor leagues were phased out as the organization shifted its focus to outdoor soccer in the 1990s.

These competitions show the evolution of the USL from its origins as an indoor soccer league to a modern, multi-tiered system supporting professional and developmental soccer across North America.
