<text>Donald Woods Winnicott (7 April 1896 – 25 January 1971) was an English paediatrician and psychoanalyst who was especially influential in the field of object relations theory and developmental psychology. He was a leading member of the British Independent Group of the British Psychoanalytical Society, President of the British Psychoanalytical Society twice (1956–1959 and 1965–1968), and a close associate of British writer and psychoanalyst Marion Milner.

Winnicott is best known for his ideas on the true self and false self, the &quot;good enough&quot; parent, and borrowed from his second wife, Clare, arguably his chief professional collaborator, the notion of the transitional object. He wrote several books, including &quot;Playing and Reality&quot;, and over 200 papers.

==Early life and education==
Winnicott was born on 7 April 1896 in Plymouth, Devon, to Sir John Frederick Winnicott and Elizabeth Martha, daughter of chemist and druggist William Woods, of Plymouth. Sir John Winnicott was a partner in the family firm, in business as hardware merchants and manufacturers, and was knighted in 1924 having served twice as mayor of Plymouth; he was also a magistrate and alderman. The Winnicott family were staunch, civic-minded Methodists.

The family was prosperous and ostensibly happy, but behind the veneer, Winnicott saw himself as oppressed by his mother, who tended toward depression, as well as by his two sisters and his nanny. He would eventually speak of &#x27;his own early childhood experience of trying to make &quot;my living&quot; by keeping his mother alive&#x27;. His father&#x27;s influence was that of an enterprising freethinker who encouraged his son&#x27;s creativity. Winnicott described himself as a disturbed adolescent, reacting against his own self-restraining &quot;goodness&quot; acquired from trying to assuage the dark moods of his mother. 

He first thought of studying medicine while at The Leys School, a boarding school in Cambridge, after fracturing his clavicle and recording in his diary that he wished he could treat himself. He began pre-clinical studies in biology, physiology and anatomy at Jesus College, Cambridge, in 1914 but, with the onset of World War I, his studies were interrupted when he was made a medical trainee at the temporary hospital in Cambridge. In 1917, he joined the Royal Navy as a medical officer on the destroyer HMS &quot;Lucifer&quot;.

Having graduated from Cambridge with a third-class degree, he began studies in clinical medicine at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital Medical College in London. During this time, he learned from his mentor the art of listening carefully when taking medical histories from patients, a skill that he would later identify as foundational to his practice as a psychoanalyst.

==Career==
Winnicott completed his medical studies in 1920, and in 1923, the same year as his marriage to the artist Alice Buxton Winnicott (born Taylor). She was a potter and they married on 7 July 1923 in St Mary&#x27;s Church, Frensham. Alice had &quot;severe psychological difficulties&quot; and Winnicott arranged for her and his own therapy to address the difficulties this condition created. He obtained a post as physician at the Paddington Green Children&#x27;s Hospital in London, where he was to work as a paediatrician and child psychoanalyst for 40 years. In 1923 he began a ten-year psychoanalysis with James Strachey, and in 1927 he began training as an analytic candidate. Strachey discussed Winnicott&#x27;s case with his wife Alix Strachey, apparently reporting that Winnicott&#x27;s sex life was affected by his anxieties. Winnicott&#x27;s second analysis, beginning in 1936, was with Joan Riviere.

Winnicott rose to prominence as a psychoanalyst just as the followers of Anna Freud were in conflict with those of Melanie Klein for the right to be called Sigmund Freud&#x27;s &quot;true intellectual heirs&quot;. Out of the Controversial discussions during World War II, a compromise was reached with three more-or-less amicable groups within the psychoanalytic movement: the &quot;Freudians&quot;, the &quot;Kleinians&quot;, and the &quot;Middle Group&quot; of the British Psychoanalytical Society (the latter being called the &quot;Independent Group&quot;), to which Winnicott belonged, along with Ronald Fairbairn, Michael Balint, Masud Khan, John Bowlby, Marion Milner, and Margaret Little. 

During the Second World War, Winnicott served as consultant paediatrician to the children&#x27;s evacuation programme. During the war, he met and worked with Clare Britton, a psychiatric social worker who became his colleague in treating children displaced from their homes by wartime evacuation. Winnicott was lecturing after the war and Janet Quigley and Isa Benzie of the BBC asked him to give over sixty talks on the radio between 1943 and 1966. His first series of talks in 1943 was titled &quot;Happy Children.&quot; As a result of the success of these talks, Quigley offered him total control over the content of his talks but this soon became more consultative as Quigley advised him on the correct pitch.

After the war, he also saw patients in his private practice. Among contemporaries influenced by Winnicott was R. D. Laing, who wrote to Winnicott in 1958 acknowledging his help.

Winnicott divorced his first wife in 1949 and married Clare Britton (1906–1984) in 1951. A keen observer of children as a social worker and a psychoanalyst in her own right, she had an important influence on the development of his theories and likely acted as midwife to his prolific publications after they met.

Except for one book published in 1931 (&quot;Clinical Notes on Disorders of Childhood&quot;), all of Winnicott&#x27;s books were published after 1944, including &quot;The Ordinary Devoted Mother and Her Baby&quot; (1949), &quot;The Child and the Family&quot; (1957), &quot;Playing and Reality&quot; (1971), and &quot;Holding and Interpretation: Fragment of an Analysis&quot; (1986).

Winnicott died on 25 January 1971, following the last of a series of heart attacks and was cremated in London. Clare Winnicott oversaw the posthumous publication of several of his works.

==Concept of holding==

Winnicott&#x27;s paediatric work with children and their mothers led to the development of his influential concept concerning the &quot;holding environment&quot;. Winnicott claimed that &quot;the foundations of health are laid down by the ordinary mother in her ordinary loving care of her own baby&quot;, central to which was the mother&#x27;s attentive holding of her child.

Winnicott considered that the &quot;mother&#x27;s technique of holding, of bathing, of feeding, everything she did for the baby, added up to the child&#x27;s first idea of the mother&quot;, as well as fostering the ability to experience the body as the place wherein one securely lives. Extrapolating the concept of holding from mother to family and the outside world, Winnicott saw as key to healthy development &quot;the continuation of reliable holding in terms of the ever-widening circle of family and school and social life&quot;.

Winnicott was influential in viewing the work of the psychotherapist as offering a substitute holding environment based on the mother/infant bond. Winnicott wrote: &quot;A correct and well-timed interpretation in an analytic treatment gives a sense of being held physically that is more real...than if a real holding or nursing had taken place. Understanding goes deeper&quot;.

His theoretical writings emphasised empathy, imagination, and, in the words of philosopher Martha Nussbaum, who has been a proponent of his work, &quot;the highly particular transactions that constitute love between two imperfect people.&quot;

==Anti-social tendency==
Connected to the concept of holding is what Winnicott called the anti-social tendency, something which he argued &quot;may be found in a normal individual, or in one that is neurotic or psychotic&quot;. The delinquent child, Winnicott thought, was looking for a sense of secure holding lacking in their family of origin from society at large. He considered antisocial behaviour as a cry for help, fuelled by a sense of loss of integrity, when the familial holding environment was inadequate or ruptured.

==Play and the sense of being real==
One of the elements that Winnicott considered could be lost in childhood was what he called the sense of being for him, a primary element, of which a sense of doing is only a derivative. The capacity for being the ability to feel genuinely alive inside, which Winnicott saw as essential to the maintenance of a true self was fostered in his view by the practice of childhood play.

In contrast to the emphasis in orthodox psychoanalysis upon generating insight into unconscious processes, Winnicott considered that playing was the key to emotional and psychological well-being. It is likely that he first came upon this notion from his collaboration in wartime with the psychiatric social worker, Clare Britton, (later a psychoanalyst and his second wife) who in 1945 published an article on the importance of play for children. By &quot;playing&quot;, he meant not only the ways that children of all ages play, but also the way adults &quot;play&quot; through making art, or engaging in sports, hobbies, humour, meaningful conversation, et cetera. At any age, he saw play as crucial to the development of authentic selfhood, because when people play they feel real, spontaneous and alive, and keenly interested in what they are doing. He thought that insight in psychoanalysis was helpful when it came to the patient as a playful experience of creative, genuine discovery; dangerous when patients were pressured to comply with their analyst&#x27;s authoritative interpretations, thus potentially merely reinforcing a patient&#x27;s false self. Winnicott believed that it was only in playing that people are entirely their true selves, so it followed that for psychoanalysis to be effective, it needed to serve as a mode of playing.

Two of the techniques whereby Winnicott used play in his work with children were the squiggle game and the spatula game. The first involved Winnicott drawing a shape for the child to play with and extend (or vice versa) a practice extended by his followers into that of using partial interpretations as a &#x27;squiggle&#x27; for a patient to make use of.

The second, more famous instance involved Winnicott placing a spatula (tongue depressor) within the child&#x27;s reach for him to play with. Winnicott considered that &quot;if he is just an ordinary baby he will notice the attractive object...and he will reach for it...[then] in the course of a little while he will discover what he wants to do with it&quot;. From the child&#x27;s initial hesitation in making use of the spatula, Winnicott derived his idea of the necessary &#x27;period of hesitation&#x27; in childhood (or analysis), which makes possible a true connection to the toy, interpretation or object presented for transference.

Many of Winnicott&#x27;s writings show his efforts to understand what helps people to be able to play, and on the other hand what blocks some people from playing. Babies can be playful when they are cared for by people who respond to them warmly and playfully, like a mother who smiles and says, &quot;Peek-a-boo!&quot; when she sees her baby playfully peeking out from behind his hands. If the mother never responded playfully, sooner or later the baby would stop trying to elicit play from her. Indeed, Winnicott came to consider that &quot;Playing takes place in the potential space between the baby and the mother-figure...[T]he initiation of playing is associated with the life experience of the baby who has come to trust the mother figure&quot;. &quot;Potential space&quot; was Winnicott&#x27;s term for a sense of an inviting and safe interpersonal field in which one can be spontaneously playful while at the same time connected to others (again a concept that has been extrapolated to the practice of analysis).

Playing can also be seen in the use of a transitional object, Winnicott&#x27;s term for an object, such as a teddy bear, that has a quality for a small child of being both real and made-up at the same time. Winnicott pointed out that no one demands that a toddler explain whether his Binky is a &quot;real bear&quot; or a creation of the child&#x27;s own imagination, and went on to argue that it is very important that the child is allowed to experience the Binky as being in an undefined, &quot;transitional&quot; status between the child&#x27;s imagination and the real world outside the child. For Winnicott, one of the most important and precarious stages of development was in the first three years of life, when an infant grows into a child with an increasingly separate sense of self in relation to a larger world of other people. In health, the child learns to bring his or her spontaneous, real self into play with others; in a false self disorder, the child has found it unsafe or impossible to do so, and instead feels compelled to hide the true self from other people, and pretend to be whatever they want instead. Playing with a transitional object can be an important early bridge between self and other, which helps a child develop the capacity to be genuine in relationships, and creative.

Playing for Winnicott ultimately extended all the way up from earliest childhood experience to what he called &quot;the abstractions of politics and economics and philosophy and culture...this &#x27;third area&#x27;, that of cultural experience which is a derivative of play&quot;.

==True self and false self==

Winnicott wrote that &quot;a word like self...knows more than we do.&quot;. He meant that, while philosophical and psychoanalytic ideas about the self could be very complex and arcane, with a great deal of specialised jargon, there was a pragmatic usefulness to the ordinary word &quot;self&quot; with its range of traditional meanings. For example, where other psychoanalysts used the Freudian terminology of ego and id to describe different functions of a person&#x27;s psychology, Winnicott at times used &quot;self&quot; to refer to both. For Winnicott, the self is a very important part of mental and emotional well-being which plays a vital role in creativity. He thought that people were born without a clearly developed self and had to &quot;search&quot; for an authentic sense of self as they grew. &quot;For Winnicott, the sense of feeling real, feeling in touch with others and with one&#x27;s own body and its processes was essential for living a life.&quot;

===True self===
&quot;Only the true self can be creative and only the true self can feel real.&quot; 

Winnicott believed one of the developmental hurdles for an infant to pass is the risk of being traumatised by being too aware too soon of how small and helpless they really are. A baby who is too aware of real-world dangers will be too anxious to learn optimally. A good-enough parent is well enough attuned and responsive to protect the baby with an illusion of omnipotence, or being all-powerful. For example, a well-cared-for baby usually does not feel hungry for very long before being fed. Winnicott thought the parents&#x27; quick response of feeding the baby gives the baby a sense that whenever she&#x27;s hungry, food appears as if by magic, as if the baby herself makes food appear just by being hungry. To feel this powerful, Winnicott thought, allowed a baby to feel confident, calm and curious, and able to learn without having to invest a lot of energy into defences.

===False self===
In Winnicott&#x27;s writing, the &quot;False Self&quot; is a defence, a kind of mask of behaviour that complies with others&#x27; expectations. Winnicott thought that in health, a False Self was what allowed one to present a &quot;polite and mannered attitude&quot; in public.

But he saw more serious emotional problems in patients who seemed unable to feel spontaneous, alive or real to themselves anywhere, in any part of their lives, yet managed to put on a successful &quot;show of being real&quot;. Such patients suffered inwardly from a sense of being empty, dead or &quot;phoney&quot;.

Winnicott thought that this more extreme kind of False Self began to develop in infancy, as a defence against an environment that felt unsafe or overwhelming because of a lack of reasonably attuned caregiving. He thought that parents did not need to be perfectly attuned, but just &quot;ordinarily devoted&quot; or &quot;good enough&quot; to protect the baby from often experiencing overwhelming extremes of discomfort and distress, emotional or physical. But babies who lack this kind of external protection, Winnicott thought, had to do their best with their own crude defences.

One of the main defences Winnicott thought a baby could resort to was what he called &quot;compliance&quot;, or behaviour motivated by a desire to please others rather than spontaneously express one&#x27;s own feelings and ideas. For example, if a baby&#x27;s caregiver was severely depressed, the baby would anxiously sense a lack of responsiveness, would not be able to enjoy an illusion of omnipotence, and might instead focus his energies and attentions on finding ways to get a positive response from the distracted and unhappy caregiver by being a &quot;good baby&quot;. The &quot;False Self&quot; is a defence of constantly seeking to anticipate others&#x27; demands and complying with them, as a way of protecting the &quot;True Self&quot; from a world that is felt to be unsafe.

Winnicott thought that the &quot;False Self&quot; developed through a process of introjection (a concept developed early on by Freud) or internalising one&#x27;s experience of others. Instead of basing his personality on his own unforced feelings, thoughts, and initiatives, the person with a &quot;False Self&quot; disorder would essentially be imitating and internalising other people&#x27;s behaviour a mode in which he could outwardly come to seem &quot;just like&quot; his mother, father, brother, nurse, or whoever had dominated his world, but inwardly he would feel bored, empty, dead, or &quot;phoney&quot;. Winnicott saw this as an unconscious process: not only others but also the person himself would mistake his &quot;False Self&quot; for his real personality. But even with the appearance of success, and of social gains, he would feel unreal and lack the sense of really being alive or happy.

The division of the True and False self roughly develops from Freud&#x27;s (1923) notion of the Superego which compels the Ego to modify and inhibit libidinal Id impulses, possibly leading to excessive repression but certainly altering the way the environment is perceived and responded to. However, it is not a close equation as the Id, Ego and Superego are complex and dynamic inter-related systems that do not fit well into such a dichotomy. The theory more closely resembles Carl Rogers&#x27; simplified notions of the Real and Ideal self. According to Winnicott, in every person the extent of division between True and False Self can be placed on a continuum between the healthy and the pathological. The True Self, which in health gives the person a sense of being alive, real, and creative, will always be in part or in whole hidden; the False Self is a compliant adaptation to the environment, but in health it does not dominate the person&#x27;s internal life or block him from feeling spontaneous feelings, even if he chooses not to express them. The healthy &quot;False Self&quot; feels that it is still being true to the &quot;True Self&quot;. It can be compliant to expectations but without feeling that it has betrayed its &quot;True Self&quot;.

==Winnicott on Carl Jung==

Winnicott&#x27;s assessment of the other great pioneer of psychoanalysis, Carl Jung, appeared when he published an extensive review of Jung&#x27;s partially autobiographical work, &quot;Memories, Dreams, Reflections&quot;. In it Winnicott focuses on the first three chapters of the work that: He discusses Jung&#x27;s evident early experiences of psychotic illness from around the age of four, from within his own theoretical framework. He goes on to comment on the relationship between Freud and Jung. He also discusses the Jungian &#x27;unconscious&#x27; and Jung&#x27;s concept of the &#x27;self&#x27;.

==Criticism and influence==
Winnicott&#x27;s theoretical elusiveness has been linked to his efforts to modify Kleinian views. Yet whereas from a Kleinian standpoint, his repudiation of the concepts of envy and the death drive were a resistant retreat from the harsh realities Klein had found in infant life, he has also been accused of being too close to her, of sharing in her regressive shift of focus away from the Oedipus complex to the pre-oedipal.

The psychoanalyst, Jan Abram, a former director of the &quot;Squiggle Foundation&quot;, intended to promote Winnicott&#x27;s work, who therefore may be said to be partisan, has proposed a coherent interpretation for the omission of Winnicott&#x27;s theories from many mainstream psychoanalytic trainings. His view of the environment and use of accessible everyday language, addressing the parent community, as opposed to just the Kleinian psychoanalytic community, may account in part for the distancing and making him somewhat &quot;niche&quot;.

Winnicott has also been accused of identifying himself in his theoretical stance with an idealised mother, in the tradition of mother (Madonna) and child. Related is his downplaying of the importance of the erotic in his work, as well as the Wordsworthian Romanticism of his cult of childhood play (exaggerated still further in some of his followers).

His theories of the true/false self may have been over-influenced by his own childhood experience of caring for a depressed mother, which resulted in the development of a prematurely mature self which he was only subsequently able to undo.

Nevertheless, Winnicott remains one of the few twentieth-century analysts who, in stature, breadth, minuteness of observations, and theoretical fertility can legitimately be compared to Sigmund Freud. Along with Jacques Derrida, Winnicott is a fundamental resource for philosopher Bernard Stiegler&#x27;s &quot;What Makes Life Worth Living: On Pharmacology&quot; (2010).

<text>Andrew Sydney Withiel Thomas, AO (born 18 December 1951) is an Australian and American aerospace engineer and a former NASA astronaut. He has dual nationality; he became a U.S. citizen in December 1986, hoping to gain entry to NASA&#x27;s astronaut program. He is married to fellow NASA astronaut Shannon Walker.

==Education==
Thomas went to St Andrews Primary School, Adelaide at Walkerville in South Australia and subsequently to St Peter&#x27;s College, Adelaide. After secondary school, he studied at the University of Adelaide, where he received a BEng degree with First Class Honours in 1973 and a PhD degree in 1978, both in Mechanical Engineering.

He appears in the 1972 edition of the Adelaide University Engineering Society&#x27;s (AUES) annual publication, &quot;Hysteresis&quot;. The caption below a photograph of the 21-year-old Thomas reads:
He is the great-great-grandson of Frederick George Waterhouse, first curator of the South Australian Institute Museum, and naturalist of the John McDouall Stuart Expedition 1861–1862.

==Early career==
As a child, growing up in Fullarton, Adelaide, Thomas was fascinated by space. His father has described how he started building model rockets from cardboard and plastics. After completing his studies, Thomas accepted an offer from Lockheed in Atlanta. By 1990 he was the organisation&#x27;s principal aerodynamic scientist. His career continued in the field, steering towards more senior research positions.

==NASA career==
Thomas was selected by NASA in March 1992 and reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1992. In August 1993, following one year of training, he was appointed a member of the NASA Astronaut Corps and was qualified for an assignment as a mission specialist on Space Shuttle flight crews.

While awaiting space flight assignment, Thomas supported shuttle launch and landing operations as an Astronaut Support Person (ASP) at the Kennedy Space Center. He also provided technical support to the Space Shuttle Main Engine project, the Solid Rocket Motor project and the External Tank project at the Marshall Space Flight Center. In June 1995, Thomas was named as payload commander for STS-77 and flew his first flight in space on &quot;Endeavour&quot; in May 1996. Although Paul D. Scully-Power had entered orbit as an oceanographer in 1985, Thomas was the first Australia-born professional astronaut to enter space.

He next trained at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City, Russia in preparation for a long-duration flight. In 1998, he served as Board Engineer 2 aboard the Russian Space Station Mir for 140 days. From August 2001 to November 2003, Thomas served as Deputy Chief of the Astronaut Office. Thomas completed his fourth space flight on STS-114 and has logged over 177 days in space. He worked on issues for the Exploration Branch of the Astronaut Office until his retirement from NASA in February 2014.

NASA officially announced Thomas&#x27; retirement on 20 June 2014, which took effect on 1 March 2014, after 22 years with the space agency.

===Spaceflights===
STS-77 was a mission during which the crew deployed two satellites, tested a large inflatable space structure in orbit and conducted a variety of scientific experiments in a Spacehab laboratory module carried in &quot;Endeavour&#x27;s&quot; payload bay. The flight was launched from the Kennedy Space Center on 19 May 1996 and completed 160 orbits above the Earth while traveling 4.1 million miles and logging 240 hours and 39 minutes in space.

On 22 January 1998, Thomas launched aboard Space Shuttle &quot; Endeavour&quot; as part of the STS-89 crew to dock with the Mir Space Station. He served aboard &quot;Mir&quot; as flight engineer 2 and returned to Earth with the crew of STS-91 aboard Space Shuttle &quot; Discovery&quot; on 12 June 1998, completing 130 days in space and 2,250 orbits of Earth.

STS-102 &quot;Discovery&quot; (8–21 March 2001) was the eighth Shuttle mission to visit the International Space Station and Thomas&#x27;s third flight. Mission accomplishments included the delivery of the Expedition 2 crew and logistics resupply with the Leonardo Multi-Purpose Logistics Module, and then the return to Earth of the Expedition 1 crew. During the mission, Thomas performed an EVA of 6.5 hours to install components to the outside of the space station. The mission duration was 307 hours and 49 minutes.

STS-114 &quot;Discovery&quot; (26 July – 9 August 2005) was the Return to Flight mission following the &quot; Columbia&quot; accident during which the crew continued the assembly of the International Space Station. Thomas tested and evaluated new procedures for flight safety and inspection and repair techniques for the Shuttle&#x27;s thermal protection system. After a 2-week, 5.8 million mile journey in space, the orbiter &quot;Discovery&quot; and its crew returned to land at Edwards Air Force Base, California. The mission duration was 333 hours, 32 minutes, 48 seconds.

== Post-NASA career ==
On 20 November 2020, the Andy Thomas Foundation was launched. The purpose was to advance space education, raise awareness, and contribute to the Australian space community.

==Honours and awards==
* 2000: Appointed Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) &quot;for service to science and technology through the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) programme as an astronaut and for contributions to the human exploration of space.&quot;
* 2001: Centenary Medal

<text>Labuan (), officially the Federal Territory of Labuan (), is an island federal territory of Malaysia. It includes and six smaller islands off the coast of the state of Sabah in East Malaysia. Labuan&#x27;s capital is Victoria, which is best known as an offshore financial centre offering international financial and business services via Labuan IBFC since 1990, as well as being an offshore support hub for deepwater oil and gas activities in the region. It is also a tourist destination for people travelling through Sabah, nearby Bruneians, and scuba divers. The name Labuan derives from the Malay word &quot;labuhan&quot;, which means &quot;harbour&quot;.

==History==
For three centuries from the 15th century, the north and west coast of Borneo including the island of Labuan was part of the Sultanate of Brunei. In 1775, Labuan was temporarily occupied by the British East India Company after the failure of the company&#x27;s station at Balambangan Island. The Sultan of Brunei, Omar Ali Saifuddin I tried to secure the British East India Company&#x27;s support against the Sulu raiders by offering Labuan as an alternative to Balambangan but, instead the company made a second but failed attempt to set up a station on Balambangan. The Sultan&#x27;s subsequent reoffering of Labuan to the company did not result in the establishment of a permanent British settlement on the island either.

British policy changed in the 19th century, when Labuan started to attract British interest again. Captain Rodney Mundy acquired the island for Britain through the Treaty of Labuan with the Sultan of Brunei, Omar Ali Saifuddin II on 18 December 1846. Mundy took Pengiran Mumin to witness the island&#x27;s accession to the British Crown on 24 December 1846. Some sources state that during the signing of the treaty, the Sultan had been threatened by a British navy warship ready to fire on the Sultan&#x27;s palace if he refused to sign the treaty while another source says the island was ceded to Britain as a reward for assistance in combating pirates.

The main reason why the British acquired the island was to establish a naval station to protect their commercial interest in the region and to suppress piracy in the South China Sea. The British also believed the island could be the next Singapore. The island became a Crown Colony in 1848 with James Brooke appointed as the first governor and commander-in-chief, with William Napier as his lieutenant-governor. In 1849, the Eastern Archipelago Company became the first of several British companies to try to exploit Labuan coal deposits. The company was formed to exploit coal deposits on the island and adjacent coast of Borneo but soon became involved in a dispute with James Brooke. Not proving itself a great commercial or strategic asset, administration of Labuan was handed to the British North Borneo Company in 1890. In 1894, a submarine communications cable was built by the British to link the island&#x27;s communications with North Borneo, Singapore and Hong Kong for the first time. By 30 October 1906, the British Government proposed to extend the boundaries of the Straits Settlements to include Labuan. The proposal took effect from 1 January 1907.

In World War II, Labuan was occupied by Japan from 3 January 1942 until June 1945 and garrisoned by units of the Japanese 37th Army, which controlled Northern Borneo. The island served as the administrative centre for the Japanese forces. During the occupation, the Japanese Government changed the island name to Maida Island ( [&quot;Maeda-shima&quot;]) on 9 December 1942 after Marquis Toshinari Maeda, as a remembrance to the first Japanese commander in northern Borneo. Maeda was killed in an air crash at Bintulu, Sarawak when en route to the island to open the airfield there. As the Allied counter-attack came closer, the Japanese also developed Labuan and Brunei Bay as a naval base.


The liberation of Borneo by the Allied forces began on 10 June 1945 when the Australian Army under the command of Australian Major General George Wootten launched an attack under the codename of Operation Oboe Six. Labuan became the main objective for the Allied forces to repossess. Soon, the 9th Division of the Australian Army launched the attack with support from airstrikes and sea bombardments until the capture of the Labuan airstrip. Most of the Labuan island area including the main town of Victoria was under the control of Allied forces within four days of the landing on 10 June. On 9 September 1945, the Japanese Lieutenant General Masao Baba officially surrendered at a place now known as Surrender Point near the Layang-layang beach which he had been brought to the 9th Division headquarters on the island to sign the surrender document in front of the Australian 9th Division Army Commander George Wootten.

The name of Labuan was later restored by the British and the island was administered under the British Military Administration together with the rest of the Straits Settlements. Labuan then on 15 July 1946 joined the North Borneo Crown Colony, which in turn became the state of Sabah and Malaysia in 1963. In 1984, the Government of Sabah ceded Labuan to the federal government and later was admitted as a federal territory. This was done so that it could become an offshore financial centre. It was declared an international offshore financial centre and free trade zone in 1990.

==Geography==
Labuan&#x27;s area comprises the main island (Labuan Island – ) and six other smaller islands, Burung, Daat, Kuraman, Big Rusukan, Small Rusukan and Papan island with a total area of . The islands lie off the coast of Borneo, adjacent to the Malaysian state of Sabah and to the north of Brunei Darussalam, on the northern edge of Brunei Bay facing the South China Sea. Labuan Island is mainly flat and undulating; its highest point is Bukit Kubong at above sea level. Over 70% of the island is still covered with vegetation. The main town area of Victoria is located in a position facing Brunei Bay.

The ethnic composition in 2020 in Labuan was: Malay people including Kedayan and Bruneian Malay (34,068), Kadazan-Dusun including/excluding Rungus (9,408), Bajau (6,866), Murut (1265), Chinese (9,843), Indians (891), Lundayeh and other ethnic groups (21,947), and non-Malaysian citizens (10,832). The majority of Chinese people in Labuan are from the Hokkien dialect group (but has been since decreasing due to migration to the Peninsula as well as overseas); however, there are also many Hakkas, most of whom are migrants or descendants of migrants from mainland Sabah as well as local-born Hakkas, whom are settled for more than 2 to 3 generations in the island dating as long as the colonial period, in which they came as stopover migrants or traders before embarking to the mainland (even when it was still an only island offshore municipality within Sabah state jurisdiction from 1963 to 1984) as well as a negligible minority of Fuzhounese from neighbouring Sarawak, mostly working as government staff and those posted in the petroleum and gas offshore industries and to a lesser extent a large minority of Dayaks also from Sarawak who are resident here and their local-born descendants whom are mostly ethnically Iban with pockets of Bidayuh and Orang Ulu residents.

 Census the population of Labuan is 76.0% Muslim, 12.4% Christian, 9.0% Buddhist, 0.4% Hindu, 2.1% follower of other religions, and 0.1% non-religious.

==Economy==
The economy of Labuan thrives on its vast oil and gas resources and international investment and banking services. Labuan is very much an import-export oriented economy. Virtually all of its commodities including crude oil, methanol, HBI, gas, flour, animal feed, sea products, and ceramic tiles are exported either to Peninsular Malaysia or overseas. Raw materials, parts, and equipments for industrial uses well as consumer products are imported. In 2004, the total value of Labuan&#x27;s external trade reached MYR11.8 billion from only MYR5.0 billion in 1995 for a net trade surplus of MYR5.1 billion. Among its major trade partners are India, Peninsular Malaysia, Sarawak, and South Korea. 65% of its exports are petroleum and gas-based products.

The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Labuan is estimated at MYR3.63 billion in 2012 with a growth rate of 5.8 per cent. Labuan GDP per capita in 2012 is MYR39,682. The total employment for Labuan is around 39,800 in 2012. The main economic sectors in Labuan is service and manufacturing which contributed 94.6 per cent to the island GDP. The service sector consisted mainly of Finance and Insurance and Real Estate and Business Services. Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector consists mainly of oil and gas industry and support.

The Labuan International Business and Financial Centre Labuan IBFC was created as Malaysia&#x27;s only offshore financial hub in October 1990 and was operating under the name of Labuan International Offshore Financial Centre (IOFC). At the time it was established to strengthen the contribution of financial services to the Gross National Product (GNP) of Malaysia as well as to develop the island and its surrounding vicinity. The jurisdiction, supervised by the Labuan Offshore Financial Services Authority or LOFSA, offers benefits such as 3% tax on net audited results or a flat rate of Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) 20,000 to trading companies; low operational costs; liberal exchange controls; and a host of other advantages including readily available, experienced and professional service providers. In 2010 the notion &quot;offshore&quot; was excluded from all the statutes of Labuan due to world pressure on the tax havens and offshores.

Since its inception, the jurisdiction has expanded to become a base for more than 4,800 offshore companies and 68 licensed banks. The IBFC also has over 370 registered foundations, 100 partnerships, and over 63 licensed trusts. Labuan IBFC is embarking on an aggressive growth strategy to become the premier international business and financial centre in the Asia Pacific region.

Labuan&#x27;s business focus is on five core areas: offshore holding companies, captive insurance, Shariah-compliant Islamic Finance structures, public and private funds, and wealth management. Labuan IBFC&#x27;s position is further enhanced by the launch of the Malaysian International Islamic Finance Centre initiative in August 2006.

==Development==
Unlike other federal territory, Labuan is underdeveloped. The island&#x27;s urban landscape is characterised by a mix of older buildings and limited modern architectural advancements. Key infrastructure projects, such as road networks and public transportation systems, are less advanced nor extensive, resulting in significant traffic issues during peak hours, particularly in the early morning and evening commutes.

===Labuan-Menumbok Bridge===
One of the most anticipated infrastructure projects is the proposed bridge connecting Labuan to Menumbok in mainland Sabah. Like Penang Bridge. Labuan-Menumbok bridge aims to enhance connectivity and stimulate economic growth by providing a direct link between the island and the mainland. The project is expected to reduce travel time, improve the movement of goods and people, and boost tourism in the region, reflecting their commitment to regional development and integration. 

The proposal was first introduced in the 1990s. However, it has faced numerous delays due to fact that the feasibility studies for the project were outdated and needed to be updated for the project to proceed smoothly.

==Transport==
Labuan offers two primary modes of transportation for travel to and from the island.

===Water ferry===
Labuan Ferry: One of the main routes is via water ferry services to Sabah and Sarawak. This ferry service is a vital link for passengers and vehicles, providing a convenient and scenic route across the island&#x27;s strait.

In May 2024, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim emphasised the need to update existing technical studies to reflect the current situation, such as upgrading works at the terminal, which costed RM22 Million. The funding is intended to enhance the facilities, infrastructure, jetty, and ferry ramp at the terminal. The Prime Minister said the estimated one-hour embarkation time could be reduced by addressing delays caused by immigration checks. He emphasised that efficient services from local enforcement agencies were crucial in resolving congestion issues at the terminal, rather than relying solely on new infrastructure.

===Air travel===
Labuan Airport facilitates air travel to the major destinations. The airport hosts several airlines:
* Malaysia Airlines: Provides regular flights to Kuala Lumpur, the capital city of Malaysia, offering connectivity to both domestic and international destinations.
* AirAsia: Another major airline operating from Labuan Airport, AirAsia also offers flights to Kuala Lumpur, catering to budget-conscious travellers.
* MASwings: A regional airline, MASwings, operates flights to Miri in Sarawak, enhancing connectivity within East Malaysia.

These transportation options ensure that W.P. Labuan remains accessible and well-connected, supporting both the local population and visitors to the island.

==Places of interest==
There are several attractions and places of interest in Labuan. The Labuan War Cemetery contains various war graves and memorials to the fallen of World War II. This includes British, Australian, Indian, Sarawakian, Bruneian, North Bornean, and Empire troops, with a total of 3,908 graves of fallen soldiers. A memorial service is held on Remembrance Day once every four years. The territory also has a memorial celebrating the surrender of the Japanese to the Australian Forces in 1945. Remnants of Labuan&#x27;s history as a Royal Navy coaling station include the chimney, a well known local landmark. Labuan also contains a Labuan Maritime Museum.

Labuan is also the base for diving on four popular wreck dives: the Cement wreck, the American wreck (the first USS &quot;Salute&quot;), the Australian wreck and the Blue Water wreck.

Labuan has many schools. However, it has only one international school, Labuan International School. Other places of interest include the Labuan International Sea Sport Complex. Newly proposed is the Marina Centre and Labuan Square project which were completed in 2010.

Labuan also has Kolej Matrikulasi Labuan, the only matriculation college in East Malaysia. All pre-university students from Sabah, Sarawak, and Labuan take their courses at this institution.

==Postage stamps and postal history==

A post office was operating in Labuan by 1864, and used a circular date stamp as postmark. The postage stamps of India and Hong Kong were used on some mail, but they were probably carried there by individuals, instead of being on sale in Labuan. Mail was routed through Singapore. From 1867, Labuan officially used the postage stamps of the Straits Settlements but began issuing its own in May 1879.

Although initially the design for the first stamp issue was proposed to be depicting a clump of sago palms, for economic reasons, the queen heads design was finally adopted, having been used initially for postage stamps of Grenada. The first stamps of Labuan therefore depict the usual profile of Queen Victoria but are unusual for being inscribed in Malay-Arabic (Jawi) and Chinese scripts in addition to &quot;LABUAN POSTAGE&quot;. Perennial shortages necessitated a variety of surcharges in between the several reprints and colour changes of the 1880s. The original stamps were engraved, but the last of the design, in April 1894, were done by lithography.

Beginning in May 1894, the stamps of North Borneo were overprinted &quot;LABUAN&quot;. On 24 September 1896, the 50th anniversary of the cession was marked by overprinting &quot;1846 / JUBILEE / 1896&quot; on North Borneo stamps. Additional overprints appeared through the 1890s. In 1899 many types were surcharged with a value of 4 cents.

The last Labuan-only design came out in 1902, depicting a crown and inscribed &quot;LABUAN COLONY&quot;. After incorporation into the Straits Settlements in 1906, Labuan ceased issuing its own stamps, although they remained valid for some time. Many of the remainder were cancelled-to-order for sale to collectors and are now worth only pennies; genuine franked/post used stamps are worth much more.

<text>Blowing Rock is a rocky outcropping land feature in the town of Blowing Rock, North Carolina, above a gorge in the northern most portion of Caldwell County.

The prevailing wind blows through the gorge toward Blowing Rock. There, at the end of the gorge, the wind&#x27;s path of least resistance is up the steep slopes surmounted by the outcropping, resulting in a nearly vertical and typically strong wind.

The legend of the Blowing Rock is that a Cherokee brave leapt from the rock into the wilderness below, only to have a gust of wind return him to his lover on top of the rock. This is a typical example of a lover&#x27;s leap legend. Blowing Rock is private property; a fee for access is payable at the adjacent souvenir shop.

The 2008 feature film &quot;Goodbye Solo&quot; features Blowing Rock in its concluding scene.

<text>Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), also known in some contexts as dysmorphophobia, is a mental disorder defined by an overwhelming preoccupation with a perceived flaw in one&#x27;s physical appearance. In BDD&#x27;s delusional variant, the flaw is imagined. When an actual visible difference exists, its importance is disproportionately magnified in the mind of the individual. Whether the physical issue is real or imagined, ruminations concerning this perceived defect become pervasive and intrusive, consuming substantial mental bandwidth for extended periods each day. This excessive preoccupation not only induces severe emotional distress but also disrupts daily functioning and activities. The DSM-5 places BDD within the obsessive–compulsive spectrum, distinguishing it from disorders such as anorexia nervosa.
BDD is estimated to affect from 0.7% to 2.4% of the population. It usually starts during adolescence and affects both men and women. The BDD subtype muscle dysmorphia, perceiving the body as too small, affects mostly males. In addition to thinking about it, the sufferer typically checks and compares the perceived flaw repetitively and can adopt unusual routines to avoid social contact that exposes it. Fearing the stigma of vanity, they usually hide this preoccupation. Commonly overlooked even by psychiatrists, BDD has been underdiagnosed. As the disorder severely impairs quality of life due to educational and occupational dysfunction and social isolation, those experiencing BDD tend to have high rates of suicidal thoughts and may attempt suicide.

==Signs and symptoms==
Dislike of one&#x27;s appearance is common, but individuals with BDD have extreme misperceptions about their physical appearance. Whereas vanity involves a quest to aggrandize the appearance, BDD is experienced as a quest to merely normalize the appearance. Although delusional in about one of three cases, the appearance concern is usually non-delusional, an overvalued idea.

The bodily area of focus is commonly face, skin, stomach, arms and legs, but can be nearly any part of the body. In addition, multiple areas can be focused on simultaneously. A subtype of body dysmorphic disorder is bigorexia (anorexia reverse or muscle dysphoria). In muscular dysphoria, patients perceive their body as excessively thin despite being muscular and trained. Many seek dermatological treatment or cosmetic surgery, which typically does not resolve the distress. On the other hand, attempts at self-treatment, as by skin picking, can create lesions where none previously existed.

BDD is a disorder in the obsessive–compulsive spectrum, but involves more depression and social avoidance despite a degree of overlap with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD). BDD often associates with social anxiety disorder (SAD). Some experience delusions that others are covertly pointing out their flaws. Cognitive testing and neuroimaging suggest both a bias toward detailed visual analysis and a tendency toward emotional hyper-arousal.

Most generally, one experiencing BDD ruminates over the perceived bodily defect several hours daily or longer, uses either social avoidance or camouflaging with cosmetics or apparel, repetitively checks the appearance, compares it to that of other people, and might often seek verbal reassurances. One might sometimes avoid mirrors, repetitively change outfits, groom excessively, or restrict eating.

BDD&#x27;s severity can wax and wane, and flareups tend to yield absences from school, work, or socializing, sometimes leading to protracted social isolation, with some becoming housebound for extended periods. Social impairment is usually greatest, sometimes approaching avoidance of all social activities. Poor concentration and motivation impair academic and occupational performance. The distress of BDD tends to exceed that of major depressive disorder and rates of suicidal ideation and attempts are especially high.

==Cause==
As with most mental disorders, BDD&#x27;s cause is likely intricate, altogether biopsychosocial, through an interaction of multiple factors, including genetic, developmental, psychological, social, and cultural. BDD usually develops during early adolescence, although many patients note earlier trauma, abuse, neglect, teasing, or bullying. In many cases, social anxiety earlier in life precedes BDD. Though twin studies on BDD are few, one estimated its heritability at 43%. Yet other factors may be introversion, negative body image, perfectionism, heightened aesthetic sensitivity, and childhood abuse and neglect.

=== Childhood trauma ===
The development of body dysmorphia can stem from trauma caused by parents/guardians, family, or close friends. In a study published in 2021 about the prevalence of childhood maltreatment among adults with body dysmorphia, researchers found that more than 75% of respondents had experienced some form of abuse as children. Indeed, the researchers found that adults who had a history of emotional neglect as children were especially vulnerable to BDD, though other forms of abuse, including physical and sexual abuse, were also identified as significant risk factors. As the children progress into their adult years, they start to visualise the abuse that has been done to their bodies, and start finding ways to hide, cover, or change it so they are not reminded of the trauma that they endured as an adolescent.

=== Social media ===

Constant use of social media and &quot;selfie taking&quot; may translate into low self-esteem and body dysmorphic tendencies. The sociocultural theory of self-esteem states that the messages given by media and peers about the importance of appearance are internalized by individuals who adopt others&#x27; standards of beauty as their own. Due to excessive social media use and selfie taking, individuals may become preoccupied about presenting an ideal photograph for the public. Specifically, females&#x27; mental health has been the most affected by persistent exposure to social media. Girls with BDD present symptoms of low self-esteem and negative self-evaluation. Due to social media’s expectations, a factor of why individuals have body dysmorphia can come from women comparing themselves with media images of ideal female attractiveness, a perceived discrepancy between their actual attractiveness and the media’s standard of attractiveness is likely to result. Researchers in Istanbul Bilgi University and Bogazici University in Turkey found that individuals who have low self-esteem participate more often in trends of taking selfies along with using social media to mediate their interpersonal interaction in order to fulfill their self-esteem needs. The self-verification theory, explains how individuals use selfies to gain verification from others through likes and comments. Social media may therefore trigger one&#x27;s misconception about their physical look. Similar to those with body dysmorphic tendencies, such behavior may lead to constant seeking of approval, self-evaluation and even depression.

In 2019 systematic review using Web of Science, PsycINFO, and PubMed databases was used to identify social networking site patterns. In particular appearance focused social media use was found to be significantly associated with greater body image dissatisfaction. It is highlighted that comparisons appear between body image dissatisfaction and BDD symptomatology. They concluded that heavy social media use may mediate the onset of sub-threshold BDD.

Individuals with BDD tend to engage in heavy plastic surgery use. In 2018, the plastic surgeon Dr. Tijon Esho coined term &quot;Snapchat Dysmorphia&quot; to describe a trend of patients seeking plastic surgeries to mimic &quot;filtered&quot; pictures. Filtered photos, such as those on Instagram and Snapchat, often present unrealistic and unattainable looks that may be a causal factor in triggering BDD.

===Sociocultural perspective===

Historically, body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) was originally coined &quot;dysmorphophobia&quot;, a term which was widely applied in research literature among the Japanese, Russians, and Europeans. However, in American literature, the appearance of BDD was still overlooked in the 1980s. It was introduced in the DSM-III by the APA, and the diagnostic criteria were not properly defined, as the non-delusional and delusional factors were not separated. This was later resolved with the revision of the DSM-III, which aided many by providing appropriate treatment for patients. BDD was initially considered non-delusional in European research, and was grouped with &quot;monosymptomatic hypochondriacal psychoses&quot; – delusional paranoia disorders, before being introduced in the DSM-III.

In 1991, the demographics of individuals who experience BDD were primarily single women aged 19 or older. This statistic has not changed over the decades; women are still considered the predominant gender to experience BDD. With the rise of social media platforms, individuals are easily able to seek validation and openly compare their physical appearance to online influences, finding more flaws and defects in their own appearance. This leads to attempts to conceal the defect such as seeking out surgeons to resolve the issue of perceived ugliness.

Universally, it is evident that different cultures place much emphasis on correcting the human body aesthetic, and that this preoccupation with body image is not exclusive to just one society; one example is the binding of women&#x27;s feet in Chinese culture.

Whilst physically editing the body is not unique to any one culture, research suggests that it is more common throughout Western society and is on the rise. On close observation of contemporary Western societies, there has been an increase in disorders such as Body dysmorphic disorder, arising from ideals around the aesthetic of the human body. Scholars such as Nancy Scheper-Hughes have suggested such demand placed upon Western bodies has been around since the beginning of the 19th century, and that it has been driven by sexuality. Research also shows that BDD is linked to high comorbidity and suicidality rates. Furthermore, it appears that Caucasian women show higher rates of body dissatisfaction than women of different ethnic backgrounds and societies.

Socio-cultural models depict and emphasise the way thinness is valued, and beauty is obsessed over in Western culture, where advertising, marketing, and social media play a large role in manicuring the &quot;perfect&quot; body shape, size, and look. The billions of dollars spent to sell products become causal factors of image conscious societies. Advertising also supports a specific ideal body image and creates a social capital in how individuals can acquire this ideal.

However, personal attitudes towards the body do vary cross-culturally. Some of this variability can be accounted for due to factors such as food insecurity, poverty, climate, and fertility management. Cultural groups who experience food insecurity generally prefer larger-bodied women. However, many societies that have abundant access to food also value moderate to larger bodies. This is evident in a comparative study of body image, body perception, body satisfaction, body-related self-esteem, and overall self-esteem of German, Guatemalan Q’eqchi’ and Colombian women. Unlike the German and Colombian women, the Q’eqchi’ women in this study live in the jungles of Guatemala and remain relatively removed from modern technology and secure food resources. The study found that the Q’eqchi’ women did not have notably higher body satisfaction when compared to the German or Colombian women.

Nevertheless, the Q’eqchi’ women also showed the greatest distortion in their own body perception, estimating their physique to be slimmer than it actually was. It is thought this could be due to a lack of access to body monitoring tools such as mirrors, scales, technology, and clothing choices, but in this instance, body distortion does not seem to influence body satisfaction. This has also been shown in groups of lower-income African American women, where the acceptance of larger bodies is not necessarily equivalent to positive body image.

Similar studies have noted a high prevalence of BDD in East Asian societies, where facial dissatisfaction is especially common, indicating that this is not just a Western phenomenon.

==Diagnosis==
Estimates of prevalence and gender distribution have varied widely via discrepancies in diagnosis and reporting. In American psychiatry, BDD gained diagnostic criteria in the &quot;DSM-IV&quot;, having been historically unrecognized, only making its first appearance in the DSM in 1987, but clinicians&#x27; knowledge of it, especially among general practitioners, is constricted. Meanwhile, shame about having the bodily concern, and fear of the stigma of vanity, makes many hide even having the concern.

Via shared symptoms, BDD is commonly misdiagnosed as social anxiety disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, major depressive disorder, or social phobia. Social anxiety disorder and BDD are highly comorbid (within those with BDD, 12–68.8% also have SAD; within those with SAD, 4.8-12% also have BDD), developing similarly in patients -BDD is even classified as a subset of SAD by some researchers. Correct diagnosis can depend on specialized questioning and correlation with emotional distress or social dysfunction. Estimates place the Body Dysmorphic Disorder Questionnaire&#x27;s sensitivity at 100% (0% false negatives) and specificity at 92.5% (7.5% false positives). BDD is also comorbid with eating disorders, up to 12% comorbidity in one study. Both eating and body dysmorphic disorders are concerned with physical appearance, but eating disorders tend to focus more on weight rather than one&#x27;s general appearance.

BDD is classified as an obsessive–compulsive disorder in DSM-5. It is important to treat people with BDD as soon as possible because the person may have already been suffering for an extended period of time and as BDD has a high suicide rate, at 2–12 times higher than the national average.

==Treatment==

===Medication and psychotherapy===

Anti-depressant medication, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are considered effective. SSRIs can help relieve obsessive–compulsive and delusional traits, while cognitive-behavioral therapy can help patients recognize faulty thought patterns. A study was done by Dr. Sabine Wilhelm where she and her colleagues created and tested a treatment manual specializing in BDD symptoms that resulted in improved symptoms with no asymptomatic decline. Core treatment elements include Psychoeducation and Case Formulation, Cognitive Restructuring, Exposure and Ritual Prevention and Mindfulness/Perceptual Retraining. Before treatment, it can help to provide psychoeducation, as with self-help books and support websites.

=== Self-improvement ===
For many people with BDD, cosmetic surgery does not work to alleviate the symptoms of BDD as their opinion of their appearance is not grounded in reality. It is recommended that cosmetic surgeons and psychiatrists work together in order to screen surgery patients to see if they have BDD, as the results of the surgery could be harmful for them.

==History==
In 1886, Enrico Morselli reported a disorder that he termed &quot;dysmorphophobia,&quot; which described the disorder as a feeling of being ugly even though there does not appear to be anything wrong with the person&#x27;s appearance&quot;.&quot; In 1980, the American Psychiatric Association recognized the disorder, while categorizing it as an atypical somatoform disorder, in the third edition of its &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (&quot;DSM&quot;). Classifying it as a distinct somatoform disorder, the &quot;DSM-III&#x27;&quot;s 1987 revision switched the term to &quot;body dysmorphic disorder&quot;.

Published in 1994, DSM-IV defines BDD as a preoccupation with an imagined or trivial defect in appearance, a preoccupation causing social or occupational dysfunction, and not better explained as another disorder, such as anorexia nervosa. Published in 2013, the &quot;DSM-5&quot; shifts BDD to a new category (&quot;obsessive–compulsive spectrum&quot;), adds operational criteria (such as repetitive behaviors or intrusive thoughts), and notes the subtype &quot;muscle dysmorphia&quot; (preoccupation that one&#x27;s body is too small or insufficiently muscular or lean).

The term &quot;dysmorphic&quot; is derived from the Greek word, &#x27;dusmorphíā&#x27; – the prefix &#x27;dys-&#x27; meaning abnormal or apart, and &#x27;morphḗ&#x27; meaning shape. Morselli described people who felt a subjective feeling of ugliness as people who were tormented by a physical deficit. Sigmund Freud (1856–1939), once called one of his patients, a Russian aristocrat named Sergei Pankejeff, &quot;Wolf Man,&quot; as he was experiencing classical symptoms of BDD.

<doc id="369734" wikidata="Q5038501" url="?curid=369734" title="Cardigan Bay (horse)">
<text>Cardigan Bay was a New Zealand harness racing pacer foaled 1 September 1956. Affectionately known as &quot;Cardy&quot;, he was the first Standardbred to win US$1 million in prize money in North America. He was the ninth horse worldwide to win one million dollars, (the first eight were Thoroughbreds). Cardigan Bay won races in New Zealand, Australia, Canada and the United States.

Along with his arch-rival, American champion of the day, Bret Hanover, he has a legitimate claim of being one of the truly great Standardbred racehorses. Cardigan Bay became an overnight sensation in the United States, and appeared with Stanley Dancer on The Ed Sullivan Show as the &quot;million dollar horse&quot;.

==Breeding==
Cardigan Bay was foaled at Mataura in the Southland Region of the South Island of New Zealand. As you drive into Mataura from Gore, there is a sign on the road proclaiming Mataura as the birthplace of Cardigan Bay. He was a first crop foal by a leading sire, Hal Tryax (USA) and his dam Colwyn Bay was by Josedale Dictator (USA). Cardigan Bay was a brother to Thule Bay and a half-brother to Brides Bay.

==Racing career==
He began racing in the South Island of New Zealand and gained his first stake money in a saddle pace on a grass track, when narrowly beaten into second. Ascending rapidly to the top level, he went on to win many of New Zealand&#x27;s major open class races including the New Zealand Trotting Cup, a pacing race despite the name, and the Auckland Cup (from a 78 yard handicap). His driver in New Zealand was Peter Wolfenden, who became the country&#x27;s number one driver during the 1970s. Cardigan Bay even won a major race at Addington Raceway in Christchurch while the grandstand there was on fire. A photo of this race is considered one of the great iconic images in the history of horse racing. While racing in Australasia, Cardigan Bay also notably won an Inter Dominion Pacing Championship final in Adelaide, Australia. Yet impressive as all this was, it was only a prelude to an illustrious North American career fashioned in his later years that eventually saw him become the first pacer worldwide to achieve lifetime earnings of $1 million (US).

===1960-61 season===

After winning at Forbury Park, Dunedin in April 1961 Cardigan Bay was sold to Merv and Audrey Dean of Auckland for £2500. His record at that time was 12 starts for 5 wins and 2 second places.

===1961-62 season===

In the spring and early summer of 1961-62 Cardigan Bay continued a winning sequence begun late the previous season before his sale to the Deans. He won the New Zealand Free For All at Addington during a grandstand fire and won the Auckland Pacing Cup which was his 10th consecutive win, equalling the New Zealand record, before finishing fifth to Samantha in the Champion Hcp during the Auckland Cup carnival. He then travelled to Australia to compete in the Inter Dominion Championships at Gloucester Park, Perth, Western Australia. After winning easily on the first and second nights of the Championships Cardigan Bay was to meet James Scott, the only horse handicapped behind him in the series and also an impressive winner on the first two nights, on night three. Cardigan Bay was then involved in a disastrous trackwork accident which could have ended his racing career and placed his life in jeopardy. He was able to be saved but the injury resulted in one hip being permanently lower than the other. The season saw Cardigan Bay win 7 of 9 starts in New Zealand with one second place.

===1962-63 season===

Cardigan Bay recovered surprisingly well from his injuries and returned to racing in Auckland in September 1962. He travelled to Addington for the New Zealand Cup meeting where his was fifth in the Cup and second in the New Zealand Free For All both behind Lordship. However he won the Matson and Smithson Handicaps on the remaining two days of the meeting. Back in Auckland he finished second from 48 yards behind in the Auckland Pacing Cup and won the Champion Hcp from 36 yards. The season saw him start 12 times in New Zealand for 7 wins and 4 seconds.
Cardigan Bay then made a second trip to Australia and won the Summer Cup at Harold Park, Sydney, from a handicap of 24 yards behind. In Adelaide for the 1963 Inter Dominion at the Wayville Showgrounds he won two heats before beating Dusty Miller and fellow New Zealander Waitaki Hanover by 1 ½ yards in the final from 24 yards behind. Racing again Sydney, he started 5 times for four wins and a second place in the Lord Mayors Cup behind Waitaki Hanover from 48 yards. The season saw him start 12 times in New Zealand for 7 wins and 4 seconds.

===1963-64 season===

Cardigan Bay won the 1963 New Zealand Cup by two lengths from Robin Dundee and the remainder of what was described as one of the best fields for many years. He then won the New Zealand Free For All on the second day of the Cup meeting at Addington. In the Matson Hcp he reduced the national record for 13 furlongs held by False Step from 3.21.0 to 3.18.1 starting from a 54-yard handicap and then won the Ollivier Hcp on the fourth day of the meeting. In December he time trialled in 1.56.1 at Wellington&#x27;s Hutt Park lowering the previous record of 1.57.3. Then came a win in the Auckland Pacing Cup from 78 yards and in January 1964 he won the Pezaro Memorial at Alexandra Park in his last New Zealand race. He won 10 of 14 New Zealand races during the season with one second and one third place. Visiting Sydney before the 1964 Inter Dominion he was third in the Summer Cup before contesting the Inter Dominion Championships which were held at the Melbourne Showgrounds. During the championships it was announced that he had been sold to American interests for £35,800 (US$100,000). Cardigan Bay won a heat but in the final Minuteman led all the way from the front mark beating Angelique and Tactile with Cardigan Bay only sixth from a 48-yard handicap. A record showgrounds crowd of 45,796 attended. In New Zealand and Australia he had raced 67 times for 43 wins, 9 seconds and 3 thirds.

===In North America===

Cardigan Bay was taken to the USA at the advanced age of eight, on a &quot;racing lease&quot; to New Jersey reinsman Stanley Dancer and his owners for a payment of $US125,000, even though he had only $US137,000 in earnings up to that point and was &quot;down on the hip&quot; from the severe injury suffered in Perth, Western Australia years earlier. He won many races in the US and Canada and defeated U.S. Champion Overtrick in one of three races. He was the only horse to defeat the three U.S. Hall of Fame horses of that era: Overtrick, Bret Hanover, and Meadow Skipper.

In 1964, Overtrick and Cardigan Bay engaged in two races: The Dan Patch Pace and the Dan Patch Encore. Cardigan Bay prevailed by the shortest of noses in the Dan Patch, and Overtrick won the Encore. Overtrick also defeated Cardigan Bay in an earlier race in 1964, prevailing by a neck in a mile and a half race.

In 1965 Cardigan Bay won the American Pacing Classic at Hollywood Park and the National Pacing Derby and Nassau Pace both at Roosevelt Raceway. At Hollywood Park he led a race over 1 1/16 miles helping to establish a world record for the distance of 2.03 2/5 by the winner Adios Vic. Cardigan Bay finished second after leading through the first mile in 1.56. He also had a win over Adios Vic in 1.57 2/5 which was his fastest time in a race.

April 1966 saw Cardigan Bay sweep all three legs of the International Pacing Series, the International Pace, Good Time Pace and National Championship Pace at Yonkers Raceway. It was the first time a horse had won all three legs. Perhaps his most famous encounter was with the great Standardbred horse, Bret Hanover, in the Pace of the Century, in 1966. Cardigan Bay, with Stanley Dancer driving, won that race in front of 45,000 spectators at Yonkers Raceway and became only one of two horses (the other being Adios Vic) up to that time to have beaten Bret Hanover. However, in their next encounter at Roosevelt Raceway, the &quot;Revenge Pace,&quot; Bret Hanover reversed that result with Cardigan Bay third before a crowd of 37,000.

At Hollywood Park he raced in the American Pacing Classic but did not repeat his win of 1965. In his last ever race Bret Hanover set a torrid pace reaching the half mile in 56 seconds and the mile in 1.54 3/5 before tiring. True Duane won with Cardigan Bay finishing second and Bret Hanover third. As in 1965 he finished the year by winning the National Pacing Derby and Nassau Pace.

In 1967 Cardigan Bay won the second ever running of the Provincial Cup at Windsor Raceway which at the time was the richest harness race in Canada. He also won the Washington Park Derby in Chicago.

===The million dollar pacer===
By age 12, 1968, Cardigan Bay competed to reach $1 million in earnings. He needed about $85,000 at the start of the year. He won he Provincial Cup for a second time and the James Clark Memorial at Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. In September at Freehold Raceway in New Jersey, he won his last race, surpassing one million dollars. He became a celebrity and appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; with Stanley Dancer and the Beach Boys.

A month after he reached the million dollar mark, it was, by formal proclamation, &quot;Cardigan Bay Day&quot; in Yonkers, New York. The next evening Cardigan Bay walked down a long red carpet, which led into the living rooms of 20 million viewers, on the Ed Sullivan television show. No immigrant had ever &quot;made it any bigger any faster&quot;. Dancer immediately retired him, and he was returned to New Zealand with great fanfare with thousands at harbour awaiting his arrival.

Cardigan Bay is possibly the most well-known racehorse ever to come from New Zealand. He won 80 races in all. Much of his racing was done in the United States, where he teamed up with legendary reinsman Stanley Dancer in his many appearances at Yonkers Raceway near New York City. He was the only horse to defeat the three U.S. Hall of Fame horses of that era: Overtrick, Bret Hanover, and Meadow Skipper. He was a Harness Champion in the United States, being Pacer of the Year in 1965 and 1968.

==Tributes==
Cardigan Bay was an inaugural inductee into the New Zealand Trotting Hall of Fame with the immortals Caduceus, Harold Logan, Highland Fling, Johnny Globe and Ordeal.

Bruce Skeggs, race caller for many years, rated Cardigan Bay, harness racing&#x27;s first million dollar earner and winner of the 1963 Adelaide Inter Dominion, as the best pacer he ever saw. Skeggs called a world-record 34,000 harness races through a network of radio stations. He broadcast races in ten different countries – Australia, New Zealand, United States of America, Canada, Italy, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Germany and Macau.

On the horse&#x27;s death in 1988, Cardigan Bay&#x27;s driver Stanley Dancer, reflected on the gelding&#x27;s last year of racing and said, &quot;At the end he was going on heart alone...what a mighty heart it must have been&quot;.

The New Zealand Post Office issued a postage stamp in 1970 to recognise Cardigan Bay&#x27;s achievements.

<text>Ruth Barcan Marcus (; born Ruth Charlotte Barcan; 2 August 1921 – 19 February 2012) was an American academic philosopher and logician best known for her work in modal and philosophical logic. She developed the first formal systems of quantified modal logic and in so doing introduced the schema or principle known as the Barcan formula. (She would also introduce the now standard &quot;box&quot; operator for necessity in the process.) Marcus, who originally published as Ruth C. Barcan, was, as Don Garrett notes &quot;one of the twentieth century&#x27;s most important and influential philosopher-logicians&quot;. Timothy Williamson, in a 2008 celebration of Marcus&#x27; long career, states that many of her &quot;main ideas are not just original, and clever, and beautiful, and fascinating, and influential, and way ahead of their time, but actually – I believe – &quot;true&quot;&quot;.

==Academic career and service==
Ruth Barcan (as she was known before marrying the physicist Jules Alexander Marcus in 1942) graduated magna cum laude from New York University in 1941, majoring in mathematics and philosophy. She then went to graduate school at Yale, obtaining her M.A. in 1942 and her PhD in 1946.

Marcus was a visiting professor at Northwestern University from 1950 until 1953 and, again, in 1959. She served as assistant, and then as associate, professor at the newly founded Roosevelt University, Chicago, between 1956 and 1963. From 1964 to 1970, she was a professor of philosophy at the University of Illinois Chicago (originally serving as a head of department). She was professor of philosophy at Northwestern University from 1970 until 1973, when she was appointed as the Reuben Post Halleck Professor of Philosophy at Yale University until retiring, as a professor &quot;emerita&quot;, in 1992. She continued to teach, during winter semesters, at the University of California, Irvine until 1997.

Amongst other professional offices held during her career, Marcus served as chair of the board of officers for the American Philosophical Association (1976–83) and as president of both the Association for Symbolic Logic (1983–86) and then of the (1989–92).

==Philosophy==
===Quantified modal logic===
The widely discussed Barcan formula is introduced as an axiom in QML. In her earliest published work, the publication of the first axiomatic study of modal logic with quantifiers, Marcus published under her maiden name Ruth C. Barcan. It features these three articles: &quot;A Functional Calculus of First Order Based on Strict Implication&quot;, &quot;Journal of Symbolic Logic&quot; (JSL, 1946), &quot;The Deduction Theorem in a Functional Calculus of First Order Based on Strict Implication&quot; (JSL, 1946), and &quot;The Identity of Individuals in a Strict Functional Calculus of Second Order&quot;, (JSL, 1947).

The first systems of quantified modal logic, which extended some propositional modal systems of Clarence Irving Lewis to first and second order; the papers of 1946 and 1947, were a major accomplishment in the development of 20th century logic.

Lewis gives Marcus special recognition in his &quot;Notes on the Logic of Intension&quot;, originally printed in &quot;Structure, Method, and Meaning: Essays in Honor of Henry M. Sheffer&quot; (New York, 1951). Here Lewis recognizes Barcan Marcus as the first logician to extend propositional logic as a higher order intensional logic.

===Direct reference===
Marcus proposed the view in the philosophy of language according to which proper names are what Marcus termed mere &quot;tags&quot; (&quot;Modalities and Intensional Languages&quot; (&quot;Synthese&quot;, 1961) and elsewhere). According to her tag theory of names (a direct reference theory), these &quot;tags&quot; are used to refer to an object, which is the bearer of the name. The meaning of the name is regarded as exhausted by this referential function. This view contrasts for example with Bertrand Russell&#x27;s description theory of proper names as well as John Searle&#x27;s cluster description theory of names which prevailed at the time. This view of proper names (presented in 1962 with Willard Van Orman Quine as commentator) has been identified by Quentin Smith with the theory of reference given in Saul Kripke&#x27;s &quot;Naming and Necessity&quot;. However, in a recent laudatio to Ruth Barcan Marcus, Professor Timothy Williamson says:

The philosopher of language Stephen Neale has also argued against Professor Smith&#x27;s claim in the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;.

===Necessity of identity===

Marcus formally proved the necessity of identity in 1946 and informally argued for it in 1961, thereafter thus rejecting the possibility of contingent identity. See &quot;Journal of Symbolic Logic&quot;, (1947) 12: pp 12–15

===Semantics of QML===
Marcus prefers an interpretation where the domain of the interpretation comprises individual entities in the actual world. She also suggests that for some uses an alternative substitutional semantics is warranted. She provides arguments against possibilia. See &quot;Dispensing with Possibilia&quot; (Proceedings of the American Philosophical Association, 1975–76); &quot;Possibilia and Possible Worlds&quot; (&quot;Grazer Philosophische Studien&quot;, 1985–86).

===Moral conflict===
Marcus defines a consistent set of moral principles as one in which there is some &quot;possible world&quot; in which they are all obeyable. That they may conflict in the actual world is not a mark of inconsistency. As in the case of necessity of identity, there was a resistance to this interpretation of moral conflict. Her argument counts against a widely received view that systems of moral rules are inevitably inconsistent.

===Belief===
It is proposed that believing is a relationship of an agent to a possible state of affairs under specified internal and external circumstances. Assenting to a quoted sentence (the disquotation account of belief) is only one behavioral marker of believing. Betting behavior is another. The wholly language-centered account of belief (e.g. Davidson) is rejected. Where an agent would traditionally be described as believing an impossibility until its impossibility was disclosed, Marcus proposes that under those circumstances the agent should say that she only claimed to believe an impossibility. In much the same way, when a mathematician discovers that one of his conjectures is false, and since if it is mathematically false it is impossible, he would say he only claimed that the conjecture was true. Odd as this proposal is, it is analogous to the widely accepted principle about knowing: if we claim to know P, and P turns out false, we do not say we used to know it, we say we were mistaken in so claiming.

===Essentialism===
Aristotelian essentialism is concerned with properties which Marcus defines in the context of a modal framework. One proposal is that a property is essential if something has it, not everything has it, if something has it then it has it necessarily, and it is not wholly individuating &quot;e.g.&quot; a natural kind property. It is otherwise claimed by Quine and others that modal logic or semantics is committed to essentialist truths. Marcus argues informally that there are interpretations of some modal systems in which all essentialist claims are false. Terence Parsons later formally proved this result.

===Substitutional quantification===
An alternative to Tarskian (model theoretic) semantics is proposed for some uses where &quot;the truth conditions for quantified formuli are given purely in terms of truth with no appeal to domains of interpretation&quot;. This has come to be called &quot;truth-value semantics&quot;. Marcus shows that the claim that such a semantics leads to contradictions is false. Such a semantics may be of interest for mathematics, &quot;e.g.&quot; Hartry Field, or for fictional discourse. Objectual quantification is required for interpretation of identity and other metaphysical categories.

<doc id="369790" wikidata="Q507262" url="?curid=369790" title="The Master of Disguise">
<text>The Master of Disguise is a 2002 American adventure comedy film directed by production designer Perry Andelin Blake in his sole directorial effort, written by Dana Carvey and Harris Goldberg, and produced by Sid Ganis, Alex Siskin, Barry Bernardi, and Todd Garner. The film stars Carvey, Brent Spiner, Jennifer Esposito, Harold Gould and James Brolin. It tells the story of a man who is trained to become a &quot;Master of Disguise&quot; by his grandfather when a master criminal kidnaps his parents.

Produced by Revolution Studios, &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot; was released by Sony Pictures Releasing in the United States on August 2, 2002. The film received overwhelmingly negative reviews, with many critics deeming it among the worst films ever made. Despite its panning, it grossed $43.4 million on a $16 million budget.

==Plot==
In 1979 Palermo, Italy, Fabbrizio Disguisey, the latest in a long line of secret agents known as &quot;Masters of Disguise&quot;, breaks up a smuggling ring run by the evil Devlin Bowman while disguised as Bo Derek. Not wanting his infant son Pistachio to receive the same dangerous future lifestyle as he and his lineage, Fabbrizio decides to keep his family&#x27;s nature a secret.

Twenty-three years later, Fabbrizio runs an Italian restaurant in an unnamed town in America with his wife and son Pistachio. Released from prison three years earlier, Bowman and his henchmen kidnap Fabbrizio and his wife, forcing Fabbrizio to use his talents to steal legendary artifacts around the world to reestablish Bowman&#x27;s smuggling ring. After Fabbrizio&#x27;s disappearance, Pistachio is visited by his grandfather, who reveals Pistachio&#x27;s heritage and begins training him.

Pistachio gets the basics down and his grandfather gets him an assistant, Jennifer Baker, who is a little confused about what the job entails. The two find one of Bowman&#x27;s cigars in the alley where his parents were kidnapped which leads them to the Turtle Club where it was made and they learn of Bowman&#x27;s scheme, as well as that he will be at an antiques fair the next day.

Pistachio and Jennifer go to the fair, with Pistachio disguised as an elderly woman. Bowman invites Jennifer to a party at his house. Pistachio goes to the party in disguise and distracts Bowman while Jennifer looks for clues.

That night, Pistachio and Jennifer look through the clues. Bowman&#x27;s men kidnap Jennifer, so Pistachio talks to his grandfather via a crystal ball and comes up with a scheme to break into Bowman&#x27;s lair to rescue Jennifer and his parents. They confront Bowman who has attached a mask of his face to Fabbrizio&#x27;s head. While the real Bowman escapes, Pistachio fights his father, who is brainwashed to think he is Bowman.

In the end, Pistachio helps his father snap out of his trance, and they free Pistachio&#x27;s mother and return the artifacts. Pistachio marries Jennifer and becomes an official Master of Disguise. However, they eventually realize that Bowman still got away and has the United States Constitution with him. The Disguiseys locate Bowman in Costa Rica, defeat him in their disguises, and retrieve the Constitution.

==Cast==
Kenan Thompson, Bo Derek, Michael Johnson, Jessica Simpson, and an uncredited Jesse Ventura make cameo appearances as themselves.

==Production==
There is a longstanding rumor that the filming of the scene in the Turtle Club took place on September 11, 2001, the same day as the September 11 attacks, causing production to stop and observe a moment of silence during the terrorist attacks. The rumor states that Dana Carvey was in the full turtle outfit and makeup during the solemn moment. The rumor is believed to have stemmed from a piece of trivia on the movie&#x27;s IMDb page, a section that includes user-generated content and is not subject to rigorous fact-checking. Director Perry Andelin Blake and Carvey both later confirmed that a moment of silence for the victims of the attack was held and that Carvey was in the turtle outfit during the moment of silence, but that the moment took place a few weeks after the attacks. On the morning of September 11, the movie was still in pre-production, and filming was scheduled to begin in a couple of weeks.

==Release==
&quot;The Master of Disguise&quot; was granted a PG certificate by the British Board of Film Classification for &quot;mild language and mild comic violence&quot;. To obtain the PG certificate, seven seconds of material was cut, the reasons being &quot;dangerous imitable technique, a series of head butts&quot;.

=== Home media ===
The film was released on VHS and DVD on January 28, 2003 by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment.

==Soundtrack==


== Reception ==

===Box office===
The film opened in Australia on July 31, 2002, in the United States on August 2, 2002, and in the United Kingdom on January 17, 2003 in 2,565 theaters and earned $12,554,650 in the domestic box office, ranking third for the weekend, behind &quot;Signs&quot; and the second weekend of &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot;. The film closed on November 28, 2002, having grossed $40,388,794 domestically and $3,022,207 internationally for a worldwide total of $43,411,001. When the film was released in the United Kingdom, it originally opened at #14, before falling out of the charts completely by the next weekend.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;The Master of Disguise&quot; was heavily panned by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot; has an approval rating of 1% based on 104 reviews with an average rating of 2.6/10, making it the lowest-rated film produced by Revolution Studios to date. Its consensus reads: &quot;An ill conceived attempt to utilize Dana Carvey&#x27;s talent for mimicry, &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot; is an irritating, witless farce weighted down by sophomoric gags.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 12 out of 100 based on reviews from 24 critics, indicating &quot;overwhelming dislike&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B−&quot; on scale of A to F.

Roger Ebert, awarding the film a rating of one star out of four, reserved some praise for director Perry Andelin Blake&#x27;s production design, as well as for Carvey&#x27;s imitative abilities, but saw the overall movie as being &quot;like a party guest who thinks he is funny and is wrong&quot;. Ebert also noted that the film is only 65 minutes long, but includes 15 minutes of credit cookies in order to qualify as a feature presentation. Jamie Russell at the BBC described the film as being so bad as to make other movies such as &quot;Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo&quot; seem like comic equivalents to &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;: &quot;Never have so many jokes clunked off the screen to such a silent audience. And never has 80 minutes seemed like such an eternity.&quot;

Peter Bradshaw, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, awarded the film two stars out of five, citing a limited number of amusing moments, but criticizing Carvey&#x27;s characterizations and suggesting to the potential audience member that &quot;you might want to put the shotgun in your mouth&quot;. Adam Smith in the &quot;Radio Times&quot; drew attention to the &quot;lame screenplay&quot; and &quot;barely coherent plot&quot;, and noted that &quot;when the nearest thing to a genuine joke is the bad guy&#x27;s propensity for breaking wind whenever he laughs, you can be pretty sure that you&#x27;re not in the hands of comedy geniuses&quot;.

Alan Morrison, writing for &quot;Empire&quot;, suggested that it was no more than a feeble imitation of the character comedy of the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; series, concluding that &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot; was the single worst movie ever made: &quot;a film about idiots, made by idiots, for idiots&quot;. Comedian and former &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; host Michael J. Nelson named the film the third-worst comedy ever made.

=== Accolades ===
Bo Derek&#x27;s cameo in the film earned her a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Supporting Actress, but lost to Madonna in &quot;Die Another Day&quot;.

At the 2002 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the film was nominated for Worst Picture, Worst Actor, and Worst Male Fake Accent — the latter two regarding Carvey. Its only win was a tie with &quot;Kung Pow: Enter the Fist&quot; for Most Painfully Unfunny Comedy.

<doc id="369826" wikidata="Q2002975" url="?curid=369826" title="Nepalese Civil War">
<text>The Nepalese Civil War was a protracted armed conflict that took place in the then Kingdom of Nepal from 1996 to 2006. It saw countrywide fighting between the Kingdom rulers and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), with the latter making significant use of guerrilla warfare. The conflict began on 13 February 1996, when the CPN (Maoist) initiated an insurgency with the stated purpose of overthrowing the Nepali monarchy and establishing a people&#x27;s republic; it ended with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Accord on 21 November 2006.

The civil war was characterized by numerous war crimes and crimes against humanity, including summary executions, massacres, purges, kidnappings, and mass rapes. It resulted in the deaths of over 17,000 people, including civilians, insurgents, and army and police personnel; and the internal displacement of hundreds of thousands of people, mostly throughout rural Nepal. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission has received about 63,000 complaints, as reported by commissioner Madhabi Bhatta, while the Commission for Investigation of Enforced Disappearances has received around 3,000.

==Overview==

On 10 January 1990, the United Left Front (ULF) was formed, which, together with the Nepali Congress, was the backbone of the movement for democratic change. However, communist groups, uncomfortable with the alliance between the ULF and the Congress, formed a parallel front: the United National People&#x27;s Movement (UNPM). The UNPM called for elections to a constituent assembly, and rejected compromises made by the ULF and the Congress party with the palace. In November 1990, the Communist Party of Nepal (Unity Centre), or CPN(UC), was formed, and included key elements of the UNPM. On 21 January 1991, the CPN(UC) set up the United People&#x27;s Front of Nepal (UPFN), with Baburam Bhattarai as its head, as an open front to contest elections. The CPN(UC) held its first convention on 25 November 1991; it adopted a line of &quot;protracted armed struggle on the route to a new democratic revolution&quot;, and decided that the party would remain an underground party. In the 1991 election, the UPFN became the third-largest party in the Nepali parliament. However, disagreements within the UPFN surged, regarding which tactics were to be used by the party. One group, led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal (Prachanda), argued for immediate armed revolution, while the other group, led by Nirmal Lama, claimed that Nepal was not yet ripe for armed struggle.

On 22 May 1994, the CPN(UC)/UPFN was split in two. The militant faction later renamed itself the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), or CPN(M). This faction described the government forces, mainstream political parties, and the monarchy, as &quot;feudal forces&quot;. The armed struggle began on 13 February 1996, when the CPN(M) carried out seven simultaneous attacks over six districts. Initially, the government mobilized the Nepal Police to contain the insurgency. The Royal Nepal Army was not involved in direct fighting because the conflict was regarded as a policing matter. On Friday, 1 June 2001, King Birendra, and his entire family were killed in a massacre at the Narayanhiti Palace – the official residence of the Shah monarchs. Perpetrated by Prince Dipendra, the heir apparent to the Nepali throne, there were ten deaths and five injuries – four injured victims and one self-inflicted injury on Dipendra after shooting himself in the head in an apparent suicide attempt. Dipendra fell into a coma for three days before dying, during which he was crowned as the new king. On 25 July 2001, the government of Sher Bahadur Deuba and the Maoist insurgents declared a ceasefire, and held peace talks from August to November of that year. The failure of these peace talks resulted in the return to armed conflict, beginning with the Maoist attack on an army barracks in Dang District in western Nepal, on 22 November. The situation changed dramatically in 2002, as the number of attacks by both sides increased greatly, and more people died than in any other year of the war.

The government responded by banning anti-monarchy statements, imprisoning journalists, and shutting down newspapers accused of siding with the insurgents. Several rounds of negotiations, accompanied by temporary ceasefires, were held between the insurgents and the government. The government categorically rejected the insurgents&#x27; demand for constituent assembly elections. At the same time, the Maoists refused to recognize the continued survival of a constitutional monarchy. In November 2004, the government rejected both the Maoists&#x27; request to negotiate directly with King Gyanendra rather than via Prime Minister Deuba, and the Maoists&#x27; request for discussions to be mediated by a third party such as the United Nations.

Throughout the war, the government controlled the main cities and towns, while the Maoists dominated the rural areas. In August 2004, the Maoists declared a week-long blockade of Kathmandu city which was later called off.

On 1 February 2005, in response to the inability of the relatively democratic government to restore order, King Gyanendra seized direct power and declared a state of emergency in an attempt to definitively end the insurgency. He proclaimed, &quot;democracy and progress contradict one another...in pursuit of liberalism, we should never overlook an important aspect of our conduct, namely discipline.&quot; As a result of this takeover, the United Kingdom and India both suspended their material support for Nepal. According to reports by Nepali newspaper Kantipur, China supplied arms and military equipment to the Gyanendra regime in November 2005; it was the first time China provided arms during the decade long conflict. On 5 May 2005, in response to the takeover by King Gyanendra, seven political parties began talks to form a Seven Party Alliance (SPA). On 22 November 2005, with support from the Indian government, Maoist rebels and the SPA jointly issued a 12-point resolution, which described autocratic monarchy as the main obstacle to &quot;democracy, peace, prosperity, social upliftment and an independent and sovereign Nepal&quot;, and included a commitment to hold elections to a constituent assembly and for the Maoist rebels to renounce violence.

In 2006, violent conflict decreased significantly, and instead, resistance transformed into non-violent pro-democracy demonstrations. The municipal elections held in February were boycotted by seven major parties. Instead, over 70 minor political parties promoted candidates. Officially, voter turnaround was 20 percent. Throughout April, pro-democracy demonstrations were held across Nepal, and 19 demonstrators were killed, over 400 protesters were arrested, while dozens of others were injured. On 21 April, King Gyanendra announced that he would return governance to the SPA, but this offer was rejected by both the Maoist rebels and the SPA. On 24 April, King Gyanendra announced that he would also reinstate the House of Representatives, which satisfied the SPA, who formed the reinstated house. On 9 August, the government and the Maoist rebels agreed to accept the United Nations to monitor the peace process and to manage the arms of both sides. On 21 November, the government, the SPA, and the Maoist rebels signed the Comprehensive Peace Accord, which formally ended the civil war.

The Civil War forced young workers to seek work abroad, predominantly in the Persian Gulf and south-east Asia. The economy of Nepal is still heavily dependent on the infusion of foreign income from these migrant workers. As a result of the civil war, Nepal&#x27;s tourism industry suffered considerably.

==Aftermath==
More than 17,000 people (including both civilians and armed forces) were killed during the conflict, including over 4,000 Nepalese killed by Maoists from 1996 to 2005, and over 8,200 Nepalese killed by government forces from 1996 to 2005. In addition, an estimated 100,000 to 150,000 people were internally displaced as a result of the conflict. Furthermore, this conflict disrupted most rural development activities. The revolution resulted in political, social and cultural change in Nepal.

== Transitional justice bodies ==
As a transitional justice mechanism, in July 2007, the Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction proposed legislation that would establish a Truth and Reconciliation Commission in Nepal. The parliament set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate:&quot;Murder, abduction and taking of hostage, causing mutilation and disability, physical or mental torture, rape and sexual violence, looting, possession, damage or arson of private or public property, forced eviction from house and land or any other kind of displacement, and any kind of inhuman acts inconsistent with the international human rights or humanitarian law or other crimes against humanity.&quot;Also another commission to investigate on forced disappearances and debated proposals to grant an amnesty for abuses by government and rebel forces. Both commissions were established in 2013. However, the government led by the NCP, did not extend the tenure of the working commission, dismissed it, and allegedly formed a new commission in its favor.

In 2016, commissioner Madhabi Bhatta of the TRC, a hardliner advocating that amnesty will not be given to perpetrators of serious crimes and that no one has immunity, said on national television that even Prachanda, the then-Prime Minister and former supreme commander of the guerrillas, will be questioned by the commission, reporting that she felt security threats from the former extremists.

===Army integration===
The Nepalese Army took final control over the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA), the armed wing of the CPN (Maoist), on 10 April 2012. Then Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai, who also headed the Army Integration Special Committee (AISC), told the committee on 10 April 2012, that the NA was going to move into all 15 PLA cantonments, take full control, and take control of more than 3,000 weapons locked in containers there. A total of 6,576 combatants chose the Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS), that promised cheques in the range of NPR 500,000 to NPR 800,000, depending on their rank.

In the first phase (18 November – 1 December 2011) of regrouping, 9,705 former combatants had chosen integration into the NA. In a landmark achievement, the AISC had initiated the process of integration following a 1 November 2011, seven-point deal signed by three major political parties – UCPN-M, Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) (CPN-UML) and Nepali Congress (NC) – and the umbrella formation of several Madheshi groups, the United Democratic Madhesi Front (UDMF). The deal provided three options to former PLA combatants – integration, voluntary retirement and rehabilitation. 9,705 combatants opted for integration, 7,286 chose voluntary discharge, and six combatants registered their names for rehabilitation packages. The United Nations Mission in Nepal (UNMIN) had registered 19,602 combatants in the second verification conducted on 26 May 2007. Leaked footage of Prachanda was later telecasted by Image Channel on 5 May 2009, in which Parchanda claims to have given the UNMIN an inflated number of Maoist fighters.

On 14 April 2012, AISC decision laid down that the ranks of the integrated combatants would be determined according to the NA&#x27;s, and not the PLA&#x27;s, standards. A selection committee would be headed by the chairman of Nepal&#x27;s Public Service Commission (PSC) or by a member appointed by him, and a General Directorate would be created under the NA, headed by a Lieutenant General, to absorb the integrated combatants. The combatants will have to undergo between three and nine months of training, depending on their ranks. The Directorate would only be deployed for disaster relief, industrial security, development, and forest and environment conservation. On 17 April, the NA stated that it could not start the recruitment process of former Maoist combatants until the structure—leadership and size—of the General Directorate had been finalised at the political level. On 19 April 2012, the three major political parties agreed to merge two separate proposed commissions on Truth and Reconciliation, and on Disappearances, into one.

<text>Card Sharks is an American television game show. It was created by Chester Feldman for Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions. Contestants attempt to predict the outcome of survey questions to gain control of a row of oversized playing cards, then determine whether the next card drawn is higher or lower. The title &quot;Card Sharks&quot; is a play on the term &quot;card sharp&quot;, a person skilled at card games.

The concept has been made into a series four separate times since its debut in 1978, and it also appeared as part of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot;. The show originally ran on NBC from 1978 to 1981 with Jim Perry hosting. The show returned and ran from 1986 to 1989 on CBS with Bob Eubanks as host, accompanied by a syndication production with Bill Rafferty. Gene Wood was the announcer in both the 1970s and 1980s. Another syndicated production aired in 2001 with Pat Bullard as host and Gary Kroeger as announcer. A revival hosted by Joel McHale aired on ABC from June 2019 to July 2021. Each production has featured various assistants to handle the playing cards.

Reruns of the older versions currently air on Buzzr, while reruns of the 2019 version currently air on Game Show Network.

==Gameplay==

Two contestants are assigned separate oversized decks of 52 playing cards, which the contestants themselves cut before each game (offscreen prior to 2019), and are dealt the first several cards for their row. The champion (or champion-designate if there were two new contestants) played the red cards on top, while the challenger played the blue cards on the bottom. Each contestant&#x27;s row of cards had a bracket atop it with their name on it, which was used to mark their &quot;base cards&quot;. The goal is to complete a row of cards by correctly predicting whether the next is higher or lower in value, similarly to Acey Deucey.

===Main round===
Contestants alternately respond to questions to gain control of the cards. In all versions from 1978 to 1989, the returning champion was usually selected to go first; if there were two new contestants, a backstage coin toss determined the player who sits in the champion&#x27;s position. The 2019 revival instead has both contestants cut their decks onstage and show the resulting bottom card; the contestant with the higher card goes first.

Similarly to another Goodson-Todman game show, &quot;Family Feud&quot;, survey questions are posed to groups of 100 people, all of whom are typically in a common demographic group. (For example, &quot;We asked 100 teachers, &#x27;Has a student ever given you an apple?&#x27; How many said they have?&quot;). Contestants are asked to predict how many of those 100 people responded in a specific manner. Their opponent is then asked whether he or she thinks the actual number is higher or lower than the previous contestant&#x27;s response. The actual number is then revealed, and if the opponent is correct, they play their cards first; otherwise, the contestant to whom the question was posed plays first.

The contestant who wins the question is shown the first card in their row of seven (five from 1978 to 1989 and ten in the first season of the 2019 revival) and can either keep it or replace it with the next card off the top of their individual deck, which he or she is then required to play. The contestant then guesses whether the next card in the row is higher or lower and continues to do so as long as he or she guesses correctly. If the next card is the same rank as the previous, or if the contestant makes an incorrect guess, that contestant loses control, and whatever cards they have played are discarded and replaced. The opposing contestant then has a chance to play from his or her base card, without the opportunity to exchange first. Either contestant can also elect to &quot;freeze&quot; their position if they are unsure of the next card. This prevents the opponent from playing and resets the contestant&#x27;s base card to the frozen card, and whatever cards that were turned in that instance are not discarded.

If neither contestant has guessed all the cards in his or her row correctly, or if one has frozen his or her position, play continues with another toss-up question, with the opposing contestant providing the initial numerical guess. In all versions from 1978 to 1989, as well as the &quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot; episode, the first two games consisted of a maximum of four questions each, and the third tie-breaker game contained a maximum of three questions; since 2019, only one game is played per match, with a maximum of five survey questions. If the contestants still have not cleared their row of cards prior to the last question of the round, that question is played as &quot;sudden death.&quot;. The winner of the sudden death question can either play their cards—and change their base card if they desired—or pass to their opponent, who has to play without the option to change the base card. If either contestant guesses incorrectly, their opponent automatically wins the game.

In all versions from 1978 to 1989, as well as the &quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot; episode, matches were best two-out-of-three, with the third game being played with three cards per contestant and a maximum of three high-low questions. Each game win was worth $100. The 2019 revival removes the &quot;best two-out-of-three&quot; aspect, with only one game now being played per match; whoever wins the game now receives $10,000 to use as a starting stake in the Money Cards.

====Rule changes====
In the 1980–1981 season, a $500 bonus was awarded to any contestant who provided the exact number of people responding to a specific question, a rule that was modified in the 1986–89 version. In the final few months of 1981, if a contestant was able to complete their row of five cards successfully without freezing or guessing wrong once, he or she won a $500 bonus. These bonuses were guaranteed regardless of the outcome of the overall match, meaning a contestant keeps the cash bonus regardless of winning or losing.

The 1986–89 version added two new varieties of questions in addition to the traditional survey questions. The traditional surveys could also be conducted with a group of ten in the studio audience who shared a characteristic (e.g., ten single women, ten security guards, ten people over 80). Because the odds of being exact were much higher (1:10 compared to 1:100), the exact guess bonus for this type of question was reduced to $100, and the group of ten shared a $100 bonus. The same poll group was used for a week&#x27;s worth of episodes. The other change was to add general knowledge trivia questions into the game beginning in October 1986. Known as &quot;educated guess questions,&quot; the contestant in control gives a numerical answer to the question, similar to a survey, but often much higher numerals that had to be posted as a Chyron on the screen instead of being on the contestant&#x27;s podium. The opponent, as usual, must guess higher or lower than the answer. Exact guesses won a $500 bonus for the contestant.

The 1986–87 syndicated version introduced prize cards that were shuffled into the deck. If a card was revealed, that contestant was credited with the prize and claimed it if he or she won the game. The next card from the top of the contestant&#x27;s deck replaced the prize card, and the contestant continued playing. At this time, the maximum number of questions per game was changed to a 4–3–2 format. Shortly thereafter, game #1 was also changed to a three question maximum, moving to a 3–3–2 format. However, all games reverted to the 4–4–3 format by December 1986. Also, contestants only won the prizes claimed for winning the match, or $100 if no prize cards were found during gameplay.

In 1988, the tie-breaker round changed to a single sudden death question. The controlling contestant was shown both base cards before being given the option to play the cards (and change their base card if desired) or pass to the opponent (who had to play without changing). As before, if either contestant guessed incorrectly, their opponent automatically won the match.

The 2019 version added percentage questions in addition to the traditional survey questions; otherwise, gameplay remains the same. There are no cash bonuses offered for an exact guess.

===Money Cards===
The winner of the main game plays the Money Cards bonus game. The original board consisted of a series of eight cards dealt out on three levels; the 2001 revival changed this to seven cards. The champion is staked with a dollar amount before the round begins and wagers money on each card prior to calling higher or lower. Prior to 2001, the player was staked with $200 prior to the round.

After calling the first three cards, the last card in the row was moved to the first position in the second row, and the contestant received an additional $200 to wager with the next three cards. The last card in the third row was moved to the first position in the top row, and the contestant made a wager for the final card. The minimum bet for each card was $50 ($100 in the 2001 revival), except for the final card, the &quot;Big Bet&quot; (renamed &quot;Major Wager&quot; for the 2001 revival), where the contestant was required to wager at least half of the money earned thus far.

If a contestant lost all the money banked and busted on the first row, the last card called was moved to the first position on the second row and the contestant received another $200 to wager with the final four cards. If the contestant busted after moving up to this level on either the original or 1986 series, the game ended. 

If a contestant wagered their entire bank on each card and made a correct prediction each time, the maximum payout was stated to be $28,800 on the original 1970s series, $32,000 on both 1980s series, $51,800 on the 2001 series, and $640,000 on the 2019 series. As of 2021, the only contestant that has successfully achieved this feat is Norma Brown, who won $28,800 in 1978.

On the NBC version, a champion was allowed a maximum of seven wins. On the CBS series, champions were retired either by reaching five wins or surpassing the network’s winnings limit.

Starting in 2019, the player&#x27;s winnings are represented in oversized $500, $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, and $25,000 chips. The board is now a single row of seven cards, with no additional money given halfway through. Players are given the chance to change any one card during the round. Players are required to physically place chips equal to their bet on a table in front of them on sections labeled &quot;HIGHER&quot; or &quot;LOWER&quot;. Prior to the last card, players must bet at least $1,000 on each card. Players who reach the last card without busting are given the option to &quot;cash out&quot; and quit with their current winnings rather than play the final card. If they elect to play, they must gamble at least half their bank on the last card. The maximum possible payout is $640,000.

====Rule changes====
Duplicate cards were originally counted as incorrect guesses, in the same manner as in the main game. Starting on October 20, 1980, a duplicate in the Money Cards rounds was regarded as a &quot;push&quot;; the contestant did not lose their wager, and moved to the next card. The &quot;push&quot; rule remained intact until late in the 2001 revival&#x27;s run. In the first season of the 2019 revival, a duplicate card was treated as an incorrect guess; in the second season, it was again treated as a push.

Initially, contestants could only change their base card on the bottom level of the board, at the start of the round. This was later altered to allow the contestant to change the base card on each new line of cards if they so desired.

During the 1986–89 version, three extra cards (known as &quot;spare cards&quot;) were positioned to the left of the Money Cards board. These cards could be used initially any time to change an undesired card, even to change the same card multiple times, but during the run were later amended to allow only one change per line at any point in the line. The additional amount awarded for moving to the second line increased from $200 to $400. This changed the maximum potential payout to $32,000.

On the 2001 series, each winning contestant&#x27;s score from the main game was divided by three; therefore, players started the round with $700 to wager with and that amount was added to their score once they reached both the second level &quot;and&quot; the Major Wager, which was a &quot;Card Sharks&quot; first. 

Players can change exactly one card, anywhere on the line, in the 2019 version.

===Car games===
Beginning in the fall of 1986, champions were also given an opportunity to win a new car following the Money Cards round. The car round made its debut on the syndicated series shortly after its debut, with the daytime series adopting the round in October 1986.

Three jokers were shuffled into the Money Cards deck. If a joker was uncovered, it was replaced with the next card from the top of the deck, and the contestant was given an additional chance to win a car. To ensure the contestant had one opportunity at winning the car, they were given one free joker at the onset of the Money Cards.

Following the Money Cards, a row of seven new cards were shown to the contestant, behind one of which was the word &quot;Car&quot;. Using the joker(s) from the Money Cards, the contestant designated the cards of their choice. If one of the cards selected revealed the word &quot;Car&quot;, the contestant won a new vehicle in addition to any money and prizes won earlier. The same car was featured for an entire week of five shows. During the special weeks when children played, the top prize was a trip to Hawaii and the children were given two jokers to start.

In July 1988, the bonus changed to feature an audience poll question similar to those used in the main game. The contestant was read the question and registered their guess on a board with a range from zero to ten. If the contestant made a correct prediction, they won the car. If their guess was off by one, the contestant won another $500.

The daytime series had no limit on how many cars a champion could win, but the syndicated series did. Initially, winning a car meant the champion retired, but after several weeks the show began allowing champions to continue playing after winning a car. A limit was then placed on how many cars could win before retiring, with the limit eventually being set at two. The changes coincided with a changing in cars being offered; the round started out by offering high-end General Motors cars such as Cadillacs and Corvettes, later changing to mid-priced offerings like Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac Fire Birds, and then finally to various offerings from American Motors through its Renault and Jeep brands.

==Broadcast history==
===1978–1981===

The original &quot;Card Sharks&quot; aired on NBC from April 24, 1978 to October 23, 1981, hosted by Jim Perry; it was the first new Goodson-Todman game show to debut on NBC since the end of the original &quot;Match Game&quot; in September 1969. From its debut until June 20, 1980, &quot;Card Sharks&quot; aired at 10:00 am (ET)/9:00 am (CT/MT/PT). The series was one of the few respectably-rated programs (daytime or otherwise) on NBC under Fred Silverman&#x27;s tenure as network president, which at the time was struggling to gain ratings in both daytime and prime-time.

After a scheduling shuffle necessitated by the debut of &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot; on June 23, 1980, &quot;Card Sharks&quot; moved to noon/11:00 am, a timeslot where it first faced &quot;The $20,000 Pyramid&quot;, which was in its last week of its run, and then from June 30 on, the top-rated game show in daytime, &quot;Family Feud&quot; on ABC; the first half of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; in certain markets on CBS; and preemptions on local affiliates due to many stations electing to air local newscasts, talk shows, or other syndicated programming in the noon hour. &quot;Card Sharks&quot; remained in the noon/11:00 slot until its final episode aired on October 23, 1981.

===1986–1989===
The CBS version of &quot;Card Sharks&quot; debuted at 10:30/9:30 am January 6, 1986, as a replacement for &quot;Body Language&quot;, and stayed in that timeslot for its entire run; &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; relocated to the latter show&#x27;s old 4:00/3:00 pm slot to make room for &quot;Card Sharks&quot;. Until January 1987, &quot;Card Sharks&quot; faced off against its original host Jim Perry&#x27;s game show &quot;Sale of the Century&quot; on NBC in the time slot; &quot;Sale of the Century&quot; was moved to 10:00 am that year. &quot;Blockbusters&quot; (with the then-host of the syndicated &quot;Card Sharks&quot;, Bill Rafferty) and then Alex Trebek&#x27;s &quot;Classic Concentration&quot; followed as competition for &quot;Card Sharks&quot;. This version ended its run on March 31, 1989, and was replaced by a short-lived version of &quot;Now You See It&quot;. The new host of the CBS version was Bob Eubanks; the host of the British adaptation, Bruce Forsyth, was at one point being considered for the job as well, after having a short-lived game show in the US on ABC, &quot;Bruce Forsyth&#x27;s Hot Streak&quot; (Forsyth would eventually host &quot;Play Your Cards Right&quot;, the British adaptation of the series). Patrick Wayne was also considered for the job.

The syndicated series debuted on September 8, 1986, replacing &quot;The Nighttime Price Is Right&quot;. Bill Rafferty was host of this version. For the first half of the season, this syndicated &quot;Card Sharks&quot; series had fairly decent clearances, but this changed due to the show&#x27;s ratings struggles in an overcrowded syndicated game show market. At the midseason point, the syndicated &quot;Card Sharks&quot; disappeared from quite a few of its markets, while many stations that continued to air it moved it to very undesirable late-night and early morning timeslots. The series continued to air until June 5, 1987, in the markets that kept it, with re-runs airing until September 11 of that year. Plans were to replace &quot;Card Sharks&quot; with the return of the &quot;Match Game&quot; with original host Gene Rayburn, but these plans never came to fruition.

===2001===
The Pat Bullard-hosted 2001 series debuted on September 17, 2001 (though as it launched the week after the September 11 attacks, was subject to pre-emption by several stations for news coverage) and aired new episodes until December 14, 2001. Four weeks of re-runs aired following that, and the series was cancelled altogether on January 11, 2002. In most of its markets the 2001 &quot;Card Sharks&quot; was either paired with or aired on the same station as one or both of the Pearson Television-produced shows that were airing at the time, &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; or &quot;Family Feud&quot;.

For this version, two best-of-three matches were played per episode, each with two new contestants. No questions were asked; instead, a random draw was held backstage to determine who had initial control, with the option to pass or play after seeing the first card. A single row of seven cards was used, and a mistake by one contestant gave control to the other. Both contestants were given two &quot;Clip Chips&quot; at the start of the match, which could be used to allow the one in control to change the last exposed card by correctly predicting the outcome of a pre-recorded video segment. Each game was worth $500 and could be won either by a correct guess on the last card, or by default if the opponent missed it. If the contestants tied at one game each, the deciding game was played using three cards.

The winners of the two matches competed against one another in one seven-card game referred to as the &quot;Big Deal,&quot; and could use any Clip Chips they still had. The winner received an additional $1,100, bringing their total up to $2,100, and advanced to the Money Cards. Losing contestants in either the matches or the Big Deal kept any money they had won.

For the Money Cards round, six cards were dealt out in three rows: three on the bottom row, two in the middle, one on the top. The contestant&#x27;s $2,100 was divided into three equal stakes of $700, one of which was added to their total upon starting each row. Only the initial card on each row could be changed. The minimum bet was $100 for every card except the one on the top row (the &quot;Major Wager&quot;) which required the contestant to risk at least half their total. A contestant could win up to $51,800 in this round.

===&quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot; (2006, CBS)===

On June 15, 2006, &quot;Card Sharks&quot; was the fifth of seven classic game shows featured in CBS&#x27;s month-long &quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot; hosted by Ricki Lake and announced by Rich Fields as it was one of the &quot;semifinal rounds&quot; in the tournament. The contestants were Brande Roderick and Paige Davis.

The set was modeled after the original 1978–81 production. In the Money Cards, the winner earned $1,000 for each row, for a possible $144,000. Roderick won $6,000 in the bonus round.

In the car game, unlike the 1986–89 version, the game was changed where 10 people were polled (cheerleaders in this episode) were called up for another poll question. This time, the rules were fixed and were made easier with the contestant simply having to say whether the number of people who did do what they were asked (e.g., &quot;We asked these cheerleaders, &#x27;Have you ever dated someone from a rival school?&#x27; How many of these 10 cheerleaders said they had dated someone from a rival school?&quot;) was a number higher or lower than 5. A card from the blue deck was shown lying face down and was brought out with the numerical value of the people who said &quot;yes&quot;. The card was then revealed after the contestant&#x27;s guess was made and if the value matched the contestant&#x27;s guess, then the car was won. Roderick won $10,000 along with a BMW M Roadster (worth $40,445) for a grand total of $50,445 for the home viewer.

===2019–2021===
On March 13, 2019, Vulture reported that ABC was partnering with Fremantle to reboot the series, with pre-production on new hour-long episodes of &quot;Card Sharks&quot; and &quot;Press Your Luck&quot; being underway and taping slated to begin sometime in the spring. Scott St. John (a producer on &quot;Match Game&quot;) served as an executive producer. Airing on ABC makes &quot;Card Sharks&quot; one of only a handful of shows (joining &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, and &quot;Match Game&quot;) to have at one point or another aired on all three of the Big Three television networks.

On April 8, 2019, TVLine reported that actor Joel McHale would host the new revival series. The series premiered on June 12, 2019.

On November 20, 2019, the series was renewed for a second season. From March 13, 2020 to July 3, 2020, the show suspended production as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. This resulted in the season two premiere being delayed to October 18, 2020. The series later resumed its second season on June 23, 2021. On April 1, 2022, it was reported that the series was cancelled.

The 2019 version featured similar rules as the 1978–81 and 1986–89 iterations, with two new players competing in the main game and no returning champions. A separate row of seven cards was dealt for each player, and a maximum of five questions were asked, with the fifth (if necessary) played under sudden-death rules. The winner was decided by a single victory instead of a best-of-three match. During the first season, the number of cards per row was ten.

The Money Cards round was played using a single line of seven cards. The player was staked with $10,000, presented as five chips worth $1,000 each and one worth $5,000, and the first card was turned over to start the game. One card was able to be changed before any turn in this round. The player&#x27;s wager was added to his/her total for a correct guess, and subtracted for an incorrect one. In season one, the player lost the wager if a card of the same rank was turned up; in season two, this situation was counted as a &quot;push,&quot; with no money won or lost. The player had to bet a multiple of $1,000 on every card except the last; at this point, he/she could either end the game and keep all winnings or bet at least half the total as a multiple of $500. For this final turn, the player was allowed to trade in a $1,000 chip for two $500 chips so that he/she could bet exactly half the total if desired. The round ended immediately if the player went broke. The maximum potential payout was $640,000.

==Production==
===Personnel===
Gene Wood was the primary announcer on both the original and 1980s &quot;Card Sharks&quot;, with Charlie O&#x27;Donnell and Bob Hilton serving as occasional substitutes. Jack Narz, Jay Stewart, and Johnny Olson also served as substitutes for NBC, and Johnny Gilbert and Rod Roddy also served as substitutes for CBS. Gary Kroeger was the announcer in 2001, and Rich Fields was the announcer of the &quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot; episode. Donna Jay Fulks served as announcer during the 2019-2021 series.

The theme for the NBC version was previously used on the Goodson-Todman series &quot;Double Dare&quot; with host Alex Trebek that aired in 1976 on CBS. Edd Kalehoff wrote that theme through Score Productions, and the theme for the 1980s version of &quot;Card Sharks&quot; through his own production company. Alan Ett and Scott Liggett composed the 2001 series theme. A revived version of the original theme was used for the ABC revival.

Ann Pennington, Janice Baker, Lois Areno, Kristin Bjorklund, Melinda Hunter, and Markie Post all served as models on NBC. Lacey Pemberton and Suzanna Williams were the models on the concurrent CBS and syndication runs in the 1980s, and Tami Roman was the model in 2001. Jerry Wolf and Alexis Gaube were the dealers during the 2019-2021 series. Following that show&#x27;s cancellation, Wolf departed Hollywood while Gaube became the newest model on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; in 2022.

==International versions==
The most significant difference in gameplay for foreign formats of &quot;Card Sharks&quot; was the use of married couples instead of individual contestants (except the U.S., Brazilian, Chilean, Greek, and Portuguese versions, which only featured individual contestants). All global versions of &quot;Card Sharks&quot; (except the U.S., Brazil, Chile, and Greece) were mostly produced by Reg Grundy.

==Merchandise==
* The first &quot;Card Sharks&quot; video game was released by Sharedata and Softie in 1988 for the Apple II, Commodore 64 and IBM PC compatibles. It is based on the 1986–89 format, using the single sudden-death question tiebreaker in the main game. If a contestant gets an exact guess on a question in the main game, they win a $100 bonus, instead of the $500 bonus on the show. Also, unlike the show, the game does not use the educated guess or audience poll questions.
* Endless Games published a &quot;Card Sharks&quot; home game in 2002 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the series at the time. It uses visual designs based on the 2001 production while the gameplay is based on the 1986 format of the series, prior to the car game being introduced. 18 years later, in 2020; they published another &quot;Card Sharks&quot; home game, based on the ABC version hosted by Joel McHale who is on the cover of the box. This version celebrates the 40 year old history of the show.
* Software for mobile phones was released on June 1, 2005 by Telescope Inc., which also uses the logo from 2001 to 2002. Its theme music is a remix of the 1978–81 version. The rules and gameplay are based from a variety of the 1970s and 1980s variants. More survey questions were also available for download.
* A single-player online game was released by the now defunct website uproar.com. The logo and set were similar to its 2001–02 counterpart while its gameplay (minus the poll questions) was very similar to the 1970s and 1980s counterparts. However, as of September 30, 2006, the website no longer offered any game show-based games of any kind.
* The now defunct website &quot;Gameshow24.com&quot; had an online version of &quot;Card Sharks&quot; in 2004. Its logo and set were based on the original 1978–81 format, and the main theme song had a unique mixture of both the 1978 and 2001 productions, and like its &quot;Uproar.com&quot; counterpart it had no poll questions either, but its gameplay was very similar to that of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; where players have to guess grocery items that were &#x27;higher&#x27; or &#x27;lower&#x27; than the ones that precede them. The show was also similar to &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; in that it used various sound effects and theme music from &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; at various points, such as playing the infamous losing horn for a bust or for failing to win the car in the bonus round during the Eubanks and Rafferty eras.
* In 2021, a brand new online version of &quot;Card Sharks&quot; was released by the casual gaming website called &quot;Arkadium&quot; where it mostly plays like the Perry, Eubanks/Rafferty versions from the 70s &amp; 80s (along with their theme songs from &#x27;86 &amp; &#x27;78) respectively, but just like the McHale version on ABC from season 2, it had seven rows of playing cards for the champion (red) &amp; challenger (blue) to play with instead of five.

<doc id="369832" wikidata="Q13319" url="?curid=369832" title="Frozen yogurt">
<text>Frozen yogurt (also known as frogurt or by the tradename Froyo; ) is a frozen dessert made with yogurt and sometimes other dairy and non-dairy products. Frozen yogurt is a frozen product containing the same basic ingredients as ice cream, but contains live bacterial cultures.

Usually more tart than ice cream (the tanginess in part due to the lactic acid in the yogurt), as well as lower in fat (due to the use of milk instead of cream), it is different from ice milk and conventional soft serve. Unlike yogurt, frozen yogurt is not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but is regulated by some U.S. states, such as California.

== History ==
Frozen yogurt was invented in New England, United States, in the 1970s. The American frozen dessert chain Pinkberry is credited for allowing people to customize their frozen yogurt with toppings, while another chain, 16 Handles is credited for introducing multi-choice self-service machines.

==Production==

Frozen yogurt consists of milk solids, a sweetener, milk fat, yogurt culture (commonly &quot;Lactobacillus bulgaricus&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus thermophilus&quot;), plus flavorings and sometimes coloring (natural or artificial).

Milk fat comprises about 0.55–6% of the yogurt; added in quantities inversely proportional to the amount of milk solids, it lends richness to the yogurt. Milk solids account for 8–14% of the yogurt volume, providing lactose for sweetness and proteins for smoothness and increased resistance to melting. Sugar (beet or cane) provides 15–17% of the yogurt ingredients; in addition to adding sweetness, it increases the volume of solid ingredients, improving body and texture. Gelatin and/or vegetable additives (guar gum, carrageenan) stabilize the yogurt, reducing crystallization and increasing the temperature at which it will melt. This stabilization ensures that the frozen yogurt maintains a smooth consistency regardless of handling or temperature change.

Major companies often use assembly lines specifically dedicated to frozen yogurt production. Milk products and stabilizing agent(s) are combined and homogenized. At , the yogurt culture is added. The mix remains at this temperature until it sets and is ready for cooling. After that, the mix is cooled at a temperature of . Once it has reached the desired temperature and viscosity, the yogurt is allowed to sit in aging tanks for up to four hours. Sweeteners, flavorings, and colorings are then mixed in, and the yogurt mixture is cooled at a temperature of −6 to . To create extra volume and smooth consistency, the air is incorporated into the yogurt as the mixture is agitated. With a sufficient amount of air in it, the yogurt gets rapidly frozen to prevent the formation of large ice crystals and then stored in a cold place to be shipped.

Frozen yogurt can be made in a soft serve freezer much the same way as soft ice cream. Frozen yogurt mix is sold in either powder form that needs to be mixed with water or liquid form ready to pour into a soft-serve machine. A mix with high or low-fat content can be chosen, and the amount of air introduced into the soft-serve frozen yogurt is variable. The higher the fat level, the more air the yogurt can absorb; and the more air goes into the mix as it freezes, the creamier the product will taste.

==Uses==

Frozen yogurt is served in a large variety of flavors and styles. It also has sugar-free and fat-free alternatives. Frozen yogurt shops usually offer a multitude of toppings, from fruit to nuts, popular cookie brands, and candies. Some companies offer a more tart version considered closer to the original recipe, whereas others focus on making their own taste more like ice cream.

<text>The Holstein Friesian is an international breed or group of breeds of dairy cattle. It originated in Frisia, stretching from the Dutch province of North Holland to the German state of Schleswig-Holstein. It is the dominant breed in industrial dairy farming worldwide, and is found in more than 160 countries. It is known by many names, among them Holstein, Friesian and Black and White.

With the growth of the New World, a demand for milk developed in North America and South America, and dairy breeders in those regions at first imported their livestock from the Netherlands. However, after about 8,800 Friesians (black pied German cows) had been imported, Europe stopped exporting dairy animals due to disease problems.

Today, the breed is used for milk in the north of Europe, and for meat in the south of Europe. After 1945, European cattle breeding and dairy products became increasingly confined to certain regions due to the development of national infrastructure. This change led to the need to designate some animals for dairy production and others for beef production; previously, milk and beef had been produced from dual-purpose animals. Today, more than 80% of dairy production takes place north of the line between Bordeaux and Venice, and more than 60% of the cattle in Europe are found there as well. Today&#x27;s European breeds, national derivatives of the Dutch Friesian, have become very different animals from those developed by breeders in the United States, who use Holsteins only for dairy production.

As a result, breeders have imported specialized dairy Holsteins from the United States to cross-breed them with European black-and-whites. Today, the term &quot;Holstein&quot; is used to describe North or South American stock and the use of that stock in Europe, particularly in Northern Europe. &quot;Friesian&quot; is used to describe animals of traditional European ancestry that are bred for both dairy and beef use. Crosses between the two are described as &quot;Holstein-Friesian&quot;.

==Breed characteristics==
The Holstein is arguably the most well-known and easily recognized breed of cattle on Earth, and their appearance is an iconic component of many depictions of pastoral life in art and media. Holsteins have very distinctive markings, usually black and white or red and white in colour, typically exhibiting piebald patterns. On rare occasions, some have both black and red colouring with white. The red factor causes this unique colouring. &#x27;Blue&#x27; is also a known colour. This colour is produced by white hairs mixed with the black hairs giving the cow a bluish tint. This colouring is also known as &#x27;blue roan&#x27; in some farm circles. No two Holsteins will look exactly identical due to the inherent randomness of the manifestation of the piebald gene. Holsteins are famed for their high dairy production, averaging of milk per year. Of this milk, 858 pounds (3.7%) are butterfat and 719 pounds (3.1%) are protein.

A healthy calf weighs or more at birth. A mature Holstein cow typically weighs , and stands tall at the shoulder. Holstein should be bred by 11 to 14 months of age, when they weigh or 55% of adult weight. Generally, breeders plan for Holstein heifers to calve for the first time between 21 and 24 months of age and 80% of adult body weight. The gestation period is about nine and a half months.

==History==
Near 100 BC, a displaced group of people from Hesse migrated with their cattle to the shores of the North Sea near the Frisii tribe, occupying the island of Batavia, between the Rhine, Maas, and Waal. Historical records suggest these cattle were black, and the Friesian cattle at this time were &quot;pure white and light coloured&quot;. Crossbreeding may have led to the foundation of the present Holstein-Friesian breed, as the cattle of these two tribes from then are described identically in historical records.

The portion of the country bordering on the North Sea, called Frisia, was situated within the provinces of North Holland, Friesland, and Groningen, and in Germany to the River Ems. The people were known for their care and breeding of cattle. The Frisii, preferring pastoral pursuits to warfare, paid a tax of ox hides and ox horns to the Roman government, whereas the Batavii furnished soldiers and officers to the Roman army; these fought successfully in the various Roman wars. The Frisii bred the same strain of cattle unadulterated for 2,000 years, except from accidental circumstances. In 1282 AD, floods produced the Zuiderzee, a formed body of water that had the effect of separating the cattle breeders of the modern day Frisians into two groups. The western group occupied West Friesland, now part of North Holland; the eastern occupied the present provinces of Friesland and Groningen, also in the Netherlands.

The rich polder land in the Netherlands is unsurpassed for the production of grass, cattle, and dairy products. Between the 13th and 16th centuries, the production of butter and cheese was enormous. Historic records describe heavy beef cattle, weighing from 2,600 to 3,000 pounds each.

The breeders had the goal of producing as much milk and beef as possible from the same animal. The selection, breeding and feeding have been carried out with huge success. Inbreeding was not tolerated, and (distinct) families never arose, although differences in soil in different localities produced different sizes and variations.

A Corporate Watch report on Dystopian Farming cited a 2004 study from the Journal of Dairy Science identified that between 96 and 98% of UK Holsteins were inbred to some degree, compared with around 50% in 1990. More generally the rate of inbreeding in the UK has risen significantly since 1990.

==United Kingdom==

Up to the 18th century, the British Isles imported Dutch cattle, using them as the basis of several breeds in England and Scotland. The eminent David Low recorded, &quot;the Dutch breed was especially established in the district of Holderness, on the north side of the Humber; northward through the plains of Yorkshire. The finest dairy cattle in England...&quot;, of Holderness in 1840 still retained the distinct traces of their Dutch origin.

Further north in the Tees area, farmers imported continental cattle from the Netherlands and German territories on the Elbe. Low wrote, &quot;Of the precise extent of these early importations we are imperfectly informed, but that they exercised a great influence on the native stock appears from this circumstance, that the breed formed by the mixture became familiarly known as the Dutch or Holstein breed&quot;.

Holstein-Friesians were found throughout the rich lowlands of the Netherlands, northwestern provinces of Germany, Belgium and northern France. The breed did not become established in Great Britain at the time, nor was it used in the islands of Jersey or of Guernsey, which bred their own special cattle named after the islands. Their laws prohibited using imports from the continent for breeding purposes. After World War II, breeders on the islands needed to restore their breeds, which had been severely reduced during the war, and imported almost 200 animals. Canadian breeders sent a gift of three yearling bulls to help establish the breed.

The pure Holstein Breed Society was started in 1946 in Great Britain, following the British Friesian Cattle Society. The breed was developed slowly up to the 1970s, after which there was an explosion in its popularity, and additional animals were imported. More recently, the two societies merged in 1999 to establish Holstein UK.

===Numbers===

Records on 1 April 2005 from Nomenclature for Units of Territorial Statistics level 1 show Holstein influence appearing in 61% of all 3.47 million dairy cattle in the UK:
* Holstein-Friesian (Friesian with more than 12.5% and less than 87.5% of Holstein blood): 1,765,000 (51%)
* Friesian (more than 87.5% Friesian blood): 1,079,000 (31%)
* Holstein (more than 87.5% of Holstein blood): 254,000 (7%)
* Holstein-Friesian cross (any of the above crossed with other breeds): 101,000 (3%)
* Other dairy breeds: 278,000 (7%)

The above statistics are for all dairy animals possessing passports at the time of the survey, i.e. including young stock. DEFRA lists just over 2 million adult dairy cattle in the UK.

===Definition===

Holstein in this instance, and indeed in all modern discussion, refers to animals traced from North American bloodlines, while Friesian refers to indigenous European black and white cattle.

Criteria for inclusion in the Supplementary Register (i.e. not purebred) of the Holstein UK herd book are:

Class A is for a typical representative of the Holstein or Friesian breed, as to type, size and constitution, with no obvious signs of crossbreeding, or be proved from its breeding records to contain between 50% and 74.9% Holstein genes or Friesian genes. If the breeding records show that one parent is of a breed other than Holstein-Friesian, Holstein, or Friesian, then such parent must be a purebred animal fully registered in a herd book of a dairy breed society recognized by the Society.

Class B is for a calf by a bull registered or dual registered in the Herd Book or in the Supplementary Register and out of a foundation cow or heifer registered in Class A or B of the Supplementary Register and containing between 75% and 87.4% Holstein genes or Frisian genes.

For inclusion in the Pure (Holstein or Friesian) herd book, a heifer or bull calf from a cow or heifer in Class B of the Supplementary Register and by a bull registered or dual registered in the Herd Book or the Supplementary Register, and containing 87.5% or more Holstein genes or Frisian genes will be eligible to have its entry registered in the Herd Book.

===Production===
The breed currently averages 7,655 litres/year throughout 3.2 lactations with pedigree animals averaging 8,125 litres/year over an average of 3.43 lactations. By adding, lifetime production therefore stands at around 26,000 litres.

==United States==

===History===

Black and white cattle from Europe were introduced into the US from 1621 to 1664. The eastern part of New Netherland (modern day New York and Connecticut), where many Dutch farmers settled along the Hudson and Mohawk River valleys. They probably brought cattle with them from their native land and crossed them with cattle purchased in the colony. For many years afterwards, the cattle here were called Dutch cattle and were renowned for their milking qualities.

The first recorded imports were more than 100 years later, consisting of six cows and two bulls. These were sent in 1795 by the Holland Land Company, which then owned large tracts in New York, to their agent, Mr. John Lincklaen of Cazenovia. A settler described them thus, &quot;the cows were of the size of oxen, their colors clear black and white in large patches; very handsome&quot;.

In 1810, a bull and two cows were imported by the Hon. William Jarvis for his farm at Wethersfield, Vermont. About the year 1825, another importation was made by Herman Le Roy, a part of which was sent into the Genesee River valley. The rest were kept near New York City. Still later, an importation was made into Delaware. No records were kept of the descendants of these cattle. Their blood was mingled and lost in that of the native cattle.

The first permanent introduction of this breed was due to the perseverance of Hon. Winthrop W. Chenery, of Belmont, Massachusetts. The animals of his first two importations, and their offspring, were destroyed by the government in Massachusetts because of a contagious disease. He made a third importation in 1861. This was followed in 1867 by an importation for the Hon. Gerrit S. Miller, of Peterboro, New York, made by his brother, Dudley Miller, who had been attending the noted agricultural school at Eldena (Königlich Preußische Staats- und landwirthschaftliche Akademie zu Greifswald und Eldena; the latter today a locality of the former), Prussia, where this breed was highly regarded. These two importations, by Hon. William A. Russell, of Lawrence, Mass., and three animals from East Friesland, imported by Gen. William S. Tilton of the National Military Asylum, Togus, Maine, formed the nucleus of the Holstein Herd Book.

The Trina Holstein breed was established by the Merrill farming family in Maine in the early 20th century, begun by &quot;Trina Redstone Marvel&quot; (or &quot;Old Trina&quot;) and continued at Wilsondale Farm in Gray, Maine. Trina has traced back sixteen generations to one of the first cows imported into the United States. There are thirty generations of Trina Holstein offspring today.

After about 8,800 Holsteins had been imported, a cattle disease broke out in Europe and importation ceased.

In the late 19th century, there was enough interest among Friesian breeders to form associations to record pedigrees and maintain herd books. These associations merged in 1885, to found the Holstein-Friesian Association of America. In 1994, the name was changed to Holstein Association USA.

===Production===

The 2008 average actual production for all USA Holstein herds that were enrolled in production-testing programs and eligible for genetic evaluations was of milk, of butterfat, and of protein per year. Total lifetime productivity can be inferred from the average lifetime of US cows. This has been decreasing regularly in recent years and now stands at around 2.75 lactations, which when multiplied by average lactation yield above gives around of milk.

The current national Holstein milk production leader is Bur-Wall Buckeye Gigi EX-94 3E, which produced of milk in 365 days, completing her record in 2016.

The considerable advantage, compared to the UK, for example, can be explained by several factors:
* Use of milk production hormone, recombinant bST: A study in February 1999 determined the &quot;response to bST over a 305-day lactation equaled 894 kg of milk, 27 kg of fat, and 31 kg of protein&quot;. Monsanto Company estimates a figure of about 1.5 million of 9 million dairy cows are being treated with rBST, or about 17% of cows nationally.
* Greater use of three-times-per-day milking: In a study performed in Florida between 1984 and 1992 using 4293 Holstein lactation records from eight herds, 48% of cows were milked three times a day. The practice was responsible for an extra 17.3% milk, 12.3% fat, and 8.8% protein. Three-times-a-day milking has become a common practice in recent years. Twice-a-day milking is the most common milking schedule of dairy cattle. In Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, milking at 10- to 14-hour intervals is common.
* Higher cow potential (100% Holstein herds): European Friesian types traditionally had lower production performances than their North American Holstein counterparts. Despite Holstein influence over the last 50 years, a large genetic trace of these cattle is still present.
* Greater use of total mixed ration (TMR) feeding systems: TMR systems continue to expand in use on dairy farms. A 1993 &quot;Hoard&#x27;s Dairyman&quot; survey reported 29.2% of surveyed US dairy farms had adopted this system of feeding dairy cows. A 1991 Illinois dairy survey found 26% of Illinois dairy farmers used TMR rations with 300 kg more milk per cow compared to other feeding systems. The American type of operation (North and South America) is characterised by large, loose-housing operations, TMR feeding, and relatively many employees. However, dairy farms in the northeast US and parts of Canada differ from the typical American operation. There, many smaller family farms with either loose-housing or stanchion barns are found. These operations are quite similar to the European type, which is characterised by relatively small operations where each cow is fed and treated individually.

==Genetics==

The golden age of Friesian breeding occurred during the last 50 years, greatly helped lately by embryo transfer techniques, which permitted a huge multiplication of bulls entering progeny testing of elite, bull-mother cows.

Friesian bull, &quot;Osborndale Ivanhoe&quot;, b. 1952, brought stature, angularity, good udder conformation, and feet and leg conformation, but his daughters lacked strength and depth. His descendants included:
* &quot;Round Oak Rag Apple Elevation&quot;, b. 1965, often abbreviated RORA Elevation, was another top-notch bull. He sired over 70,000 Holstein cattle, with descendants numbering over 5 million; &quot;Elevation&quot; was named Bull of the Century by Holstein International Association in 1999. &quot;Elevation&quot; was the result of a cross of &quot;Tidy Burke Elevation&quot; being used on one of the best ever &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; daughters, &quot;Round Oak Ivanhoe Eve&quot;. He was unsurpassed at the time for type and production.
* &quot;Penstate Ivanhoe Star&quot;, b. 1963, sired daughters with similar stature and dairy traits as the &quot;Ivanhoes&quot;, but with higher production. He also notably sired &quot;Carlin-M Ivanhoe Bell&quot;, the great production bull of the 80s, known also for good udders, feet and legs. A present-day genetic disorder, complex vertebral malformation, has been traced to &quot;Carlin-M Ivanhoe Bell&quot; and &quot;Penstate Ivanhoe Star&quot;.
* &quot;Hilltop Apollo Ivanhoe&quot;, b. 1960, sire of &quot;Whittier Farms Apollo Rocket&quot;, b. 1967, was the highest milk production bull of the 1970s, and &quot;Wayne Spring Fond Apollo&quot;, b. 1970, was the first bull ever to have a milk transmission index of over 2,000 M and have a positive type index. &quot;Wayne&quot; had a very famous daughter, &quot;To-Mar Wayne Ha&quot;y, that was dam of the great &quot;To-Mar Blackstar&quot;, b. 1983.
* Hanoverhill Starbuck, b. 1979, from sire RORA Elevation and dam Anacres Astronaut Ivanhoe. Between 1985 and 1995, Starbuck sired over 200,000 female offspring and 209 proven male offspring.
=== Genetic anomalies ===
===Cloning===

&quot;Starbuck (2)II&quot;, clone of the famous CIAQR sire Hanoverhill Starbuck, was born on 7 September 2000 in Saint-Hyacinthe. The clone is a result of the combined efforts of CIAQ, L&#x27;Alliance Boviteq Inc, and the Faculté de médecine vétérinaire de l&#x27;Université de Montréal. The cloned calf was born 21 years and 5 months after Starbuck&#x27;s own birth date and just under 2 years after his death (17 September 1998). The calf weighed 54.2 kg at birth and showed the same vital signs as calves produced from regular AI or ET. &quot;Starbuck II&quot; is derived from frozen fibroblast cells, recovered one month before the death of &quot;Starbuck&quot;.

The Semex Alliance also cloned other bulls, such as &quot;Hartline Titanic&quot;, &quot;Canyon-Breeze Allen&quot;, &quot;Ladino-Park Talent&quot;, and &quot;Braedale Goldwyn&quot;.

A huge controversy in the UK in January 2007 linked the cloning company Smiddiehill and Humphreston Farm owned by father-and-son team Michael and Oliver Eaton (also owners of the large, Birmingham-based stone product business, BS Eaton) with a calf that was cloned from a cow in Canada. Despite their efforts to block the farm from view of the press, news cameras broadcast this as breaking news among many of the country&#x27;s top news stations. Since then, this calf had been rumored to have been put down to protect the owners, the Eatons, from invasions of the press.

==British Friesian cattle==

While interest in increasing production through indexing and lifetime profit scores had a huge increase in Holstein bloodlines in the UK, proponents of the traditional British Friesian did not see things that way, and maintain these criteria do not reflect the true profitability or the production of the Friesian cow.

Friesian breeders say modern conditions in the UK, similar to the 1950s through to the 1980s, with low milk price and the need for extensive, low-cost systems for many farmers, may ultimately cause producers to re-examine the attributes of the British Friesian.

This animal came to dominate the UK dairy cow population during these years, with exports of stock and semen to many countries throughout the world. Although the idea of &quot;dual-purpose&quot; animals has arguably become outmoded, the fact remains that the Friesian is eminently suitable for many farms, particularly where grazing is a main feature of the system.

Proponents argue that Friesians last for more lactations through more robust conformation, thus spreading depreciation costs. An added advantage of income from the male calf exists, which can be placed into barley beef systems (finishing from 11 months) or steers taken on to finish at two years, on a cheap system of grass and silage. Very respectable grades can be obtained, commensurate with beef breeds, thereby providing extra income for the farm.

Such extensive, low-cost systems may imply lower veterinary costs, through good fertility, resistance to lameness, and a tendency to higher protein percentage, and, therefore, higher milk price. An 800-kg Holstein has a higher daily maintenance energy requirement than the 650-kg Friesian.

Friesians have also been disadvantaged through the comparison of their type to a Holstein base. A separate &quot;index&quot; be composed to greater has been suggested to reflect the aspects of maintenance for bodyweight, protein percentage, longevity, and calf value. National Milk Records figures suggest highest yields are achieved between the fifth and seventh lactations; if so, this is particularly so for Friesians, with a greater lift for mature cows, and sustained over more lactations. However, production index only takes the first five lactations into account.
British Friesian breeding has certainly not stood still, and through studied evaluation, substantial gains in yield have been achieved without the loss of type.

===History===
Friesians were imported into the east coast ports of England and Scotland, from the lush pastures of North Holland, during the 19th century until live cattle importations were stopped in 1892, as a precaution against endemic foot and mouth disease on the Continent. They were so few in number, they were not included in the 1908 census.

In 1909, though, the society was formed as the British Holstein Cattle Society, soon to be changed to British Holstein Friesian Society and, by 1918, to the British Friesian Cattle Society.

The &quot;Livestock Journal&quot; of 1900 referred to both the &quot;exceptionally good&quot; and &quot;remarkably inferior&quot; Dutch cattle. The Dutch cow was also considered to require more quality fodder and need more looking after than some English cattle that could easily be out-wintered.

In an era of agricultural depression, breed societies notably had flourished, as a valuable export trade developed for traditional British breeds of cattle. At the end of 1912, the herd book noted 1,000 males and 6,000 females, the stock which originally formed the foundation of the breed in England and Scotland. Entry from then until 1921, when grading up was introduced, was by pedigree only.

No other Friesian cattle were imported until the official importation of 1914, which included several near descendants of the renowned dairy bull Ceres 4497 F.R.S. These cattle were successful in establishing the Friesian as an eminent, long-lived dairy breed in Britain. This role was continued in the 1922 importation from South Africa through Terling Marthus and Terling Collona, which were also near descendants of Ceres 4497.

The 1936 importation from the Netherlands introduced a more dual-purpose type of animal, the Dutch having moved away from the Ceres line in the meantime.

The 1950 importation has a lesser influence on the breed today than the previous importations, although various Adema sons were used successfully in some herds.

The Friesian enjoyed great expansion in the 1950s, through to the 80s, until the increased Holstein influence on the national herd in the 1990s ; a trend which is being questioned by some commercial dairy farmers in the harsh dairying climate that prevails today, with the need to exploit grazing potential to the fullest.

Friesian semen is once again being exported to countries with grass-based systems of milk production. The modern Friesian is pre-eminently a grazing animal, well able to sustain itself over many lactations, on both low-lying and upland grasslands, being developed by selective breeding over the last 100 years. Some outstanding examples of the breed have 12 to 15 lactations to their credit, emphasising their inherent natural fecundity. In response to demand, protein percentages have been raised across the breed, and herd protein levels of 3.4% to 3.5% are not uncommon.

Whilst the British Friesian is first and foremost a dairy breed, giving high lifetime yields of quality milk from home-produced feeds, by a happy coincidence, surplus male animals are highly regarded as producers of high quality, lean meat, whether crossed with a beef breed or not. Beef-cross heifers have long been sought after as ideal suckler cow replacements.

Although understanding the need to change the society&#x27;s name to include the word Holstein in 1988, British Friesian enthusiasts are less than happy now that the word Friesian has been removed from the name. With the history of the breed spanning 100 years, the British Friesian cow is continuing to prove her worth. The general robustness and proven fertility provide an ideal black and white cross for Holstein breeders seeking these attributes.

The disposal of male black and white calves continues to receive media attention, and would appear to be a waste of a valuable resource. One of the great strengths of the British Friesian is the ability of the male calf to finish and grade satisfactorily, either in intensive systems, or as steers, extensively. This latter system may become increasingly popular due to the prohibitive increase in grain prices. The robustness of the British Friesian and its suitability to grazing and forage systems is well known.

Compared to the Holsteins, the Friesians:
* Calve more frequently
* Calve more often in their lifetimes
* Need fewer replacements
* Provide valuable male calves
* Have lower cell counts
* Have higher fat and protein percentages

==Polled Holsteins==
The first polled Holstein was identified in the United States in 1889. Polled Holsteins have the dominant polled gene which makes them naturally hornless. The polled gene has historically had a very low gene frequency in the Holstein breed. However, with animal welfare concerns surrounding the practice of dehorning, the interest in polled genetics is growing rapidly.

==Red and white Holsteins==


The expression of red colour replacing the black in Holsteins is a function of a recessive gene. Assuming the allele &#x27;B&#x27; stands for the dominant black and &#x27;b&#x27; for the recessive red, cattle with the paired genes &#x27;BB&#x27;, &#x27;Bb&#x27;, or &#x27;bB&#x27; would be black and white, while &#x27;bb&#x27; cattle would be red and white. 

===History===
Earlier 13th-century records show cattle of &quot;broken&quot; colours entered the Netherlands from Central Europe. Most foundation stock in the US were imported between 1869 and 1885. A group of early breeders decreed that animals of any colour other than black and white would not be accepted in the herd book, and that the breed would be known as Holsteins. There were objections, saying that quality and not colour should be the aim, and that the cattle should be called &quot;Dutch&quot; rather than Holsteins.

Only a small number of carriers were identified over the hundred-year span from the early importations until they were accepted into the Canadian and American herd books in 1969 and 1970, respectively. Most of the early accounts of red calves being born to black and white parents were never documented. A few stories of &quot;reds&quot; born to elite parents persist over time, as there is a tendency to credit the ancestor with the highest (closest) relationship to a red-carrier animal as the one that transmitted the trait, whereas sometimes it is the other parental line that has passed it on, even though the ancestor responsible may have entered the pedigree several generations earlier.

In 1952, a sire in an artificial insemination (AI) unit in the US was a carrier of red coat colour. Although the AI unit reported the condition and advised breeders as to its mode of inheritance, almost a third of the breeding unit&#x27;s Holstein inseminations that year were to that red-carrier bull. That year, American AI units had used 67 red-factor bulls that had sired 8250 registered progeny. In spite of this, any change to the colour marking rules was rejected.

The Red and White Dairy Cattle Association (RWDCA) began registry procedures in 1964 in the United States. Its first members were Milking Shorthorn breeders, who wanted a dairy registry for the cattle they had bred in prior years, including some red and white Holsteins. When Milking Shorthorn breeders were looking for potential outcrossing individuals to improve milk production, red and white Holsteins came into the picture, since the red colour factor is the same for both breeds. The RWDCA had adopted an &quot;open herd book&quot; policy, and the Red and White Holstein became the major player.

The red trait was thus able to survive the attempts to eradicate it that came from all sides of the Holstein industry. It was inevitable that even when a red calf was culled, the herd owner rarely did anything to remove the dam from his herd and only hoped she would not have another red calf. Many red calves, born in both countries prior to the 1970s, were quietly disposed of, with a view to preserving the acceptance of their elite pedigrees.

Also, thousands of Holsteins were imported from Canada each year, and many were carriers. More than 14,000 Holsteins were exported to the United States in 1964 and again in 1965. This was at a time when both countries were debating the &quot;red question&quot;. While the United States was trying to eliminate the red trait, the Canadian imports simply counterbalanced the US effort to reduce its incidence.

Canada&#x27;s number one red-carrier sire in the 1940s was A.B.C. Reflection Sovereign. His sons and grandsons in the 1950s and &#x27;60s spread the red gene throughout Canada and increased its frequency in the United States. Three other big names siring Red and Whites in the United States were Rosafe Citation R, Roeland Reflection Sovereign, and Chambric A.B.C. The red trait was readily available in Canadian Holstein genetics.

Early on, there was criticism of the policy of the Canadian AI units to remove bulls found to carry red. A number of superior bulls were slaughtered or exported. The studs were simply supporting the Canadian policy to prevent the intensification of the red recessive in the breed. The phrase &quot;carries the red factor&quot; had to be included in the description, and excessive promotion of unproven red-factor bulls was discouraged. They later added the aim of permitting intelligent breeders to use any red-carrier sire that had an outstanding proof for production and type.

It became obvious that AI was the primary way of finding out which bulls were red carriers. Prior to AI, few red-carrier sires were uncovered because their service was limited to one or a few herds. Such herds often had no carrier females, and there was only a 25% chance that a carrier bull mated to a carrier female would produce a red calf. If a red and white calf were dropped, it was often concealed and quietly removed from the herd.

In 1964, the Netherlands Herd Book Society indicated a breakdown of 71% Black and White Friesian and 28% Red and Whites. A herd book that accepted Red and Whites had already been established in the United States. A separate herd book for Canadian Red and Whites was then established, following which Red and Whites became acceptable to the major Canadian (export) markets. The sales ring began to establish interest in the new breed.

The US Holstein-Friesian Association and its membership worked diligently from its early days until 1970 to eliminate the red trait from the registered population. However, once the door was open, red and whites began to appear in some of the more elite herds. The rush to get the best of Canadian breeding even prior to the opening of the herd book brought red calves to many dairymen who had never even seen one.

Canadian Red and Whites became eligible for registration in the herd book on July 1, 1969, through an alternate registry. Red and Whites were to be listed with the suffix –RED and Black and Whites with ineligible markings would be registered with the suffix –ALT. Both groups and their progeny would be listed only in the Alternate book and the suffixes had to be part of the name. In the Canadian herd books, all –Alt and -Red animals were listed in the regular herd book in registration number order and were identified with an A in front of their numbers. The Alternates were separate in name only. The A in front of the registration number was discontinued in 1976 and the –Alt suffix was dropped in 1980, but –Red was continued. It did not bar the registration of animals whose hair turned from red to black. 

The US Holstein Association decided not to have a separate herd book for red and whites and off-color animals. The suffixes of –Red and –OC would be used, and numbering would be consecutive. The first red and white Holsteins were recorded with an R in front of their numbers. 212 males and 1191 females were recorded in the initial group of red registrations. Red and Whites registered in the Canadian herd book numbered 281 in 1969 and 243 in 1970.

An American Breeders Service ad in the Canadian Holstein Journal in 1974 on Hanover-Hill Triple Threat mentioned one of several colour variants that were not true red. Its existence was undoubtedly common knowledge among breeders in both countries, but until that time, it had not been mentioned in print. Calves were born red and white and registered as such, but over the first six months of age turned black or mostly black with some reddish hairs down the backline, around the muzzle and at the poll. The hair coat colour change became known as Black/Red and sometimes as Telstar/Red, since the condition appeared in calves sired by Roybrook Telstar. Telstar was the sire of Triple Threat, but nothing about this had hitherto been in print about Telstar, which was by then over 10 years old.

Black/Reds were often discriminated against when sold and were barred from Red and White-sponsored shows. In 1984, Holstein Canada considered recoding B/R bulls that had always been coded simply as red carriers, a designation that was not acceptable to all buyers. The breed agreed to change after checking with other breed associations and with the AI industry. In 1987, Holstein Canada and the Canadian AI industry modified their coding procedures to distinguish between Black/Red and true red colour patterns for bulls. Holstein Canada dropped the suffix Red as a part of the name in 1990, but continued to carry it as part of the birth date and other codes field.

<doc id="369857" wikidata="Q1152218" url="?curid=369857" title="Acanthamoeba">
<text>Acanthamoeba is a genus of amoebae that are commonly recovered from soil, fresh water, and other habitats.
The genus &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; has two stages in its life cycle, the metabolically active trophozoite stage and a dormant, stress-resistant cyst stage. In nature, &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; species are generally free-living bacterivores. However, they are also opportunistic pathogens able to cause serious and potentially fatal infections in humans and other animals.

== Distribution ==
&quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; spp. are among the most prevalent protozoa found in the environment. They are distributed worldwide, and have been isolated from soil, air, sewage, seawater, chlorinated swimming pools, domestic tap water, bottled water, dental treatment units, hospitals, air-conditioning units, and contact lens cases. Additionally, they have been isolated from human skin, nasal cavities, throats, and intestines, as well as plants and other mammals.

==Role in disease==

Diseases caused by &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; include keratitis and granulomatous amoebic encephalitis 
(GAE). The latter is often but not always seen in immunosuppressed patients. GAE is caused by the amoebae entering the body through an open wound and then spreading to the brain. The combination of host immune responses and secreted amoebal proteases causes massive brain swelling resulting in death in about 95% of those infected.

===Granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE)===
Granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE) is caused by amoebic infection of the central nervous system (CNS). It is characterized by neurological symptoms including headache, seizures, and mental-status abnormalities. These worsen progressively over weeks to months, leading to death in most patients. Infection is generally associated with underlying conditions such as immunodeficiency, diabetes, malignancies, malnutrition, systemic lupus erythematosus, and alcoholism. The parasite enters the body through cuts in the skin or by being inhaled into the upper respiratory tract. The parasite then spreads through the blood into the CNS. &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; crosses the blood–brain barrier by means that are not yet understood. Subsequent invasion of the connective tissue and induction of pro-inflammatory responses leads to neuronal damage that can be fatal within days. Pure granulomatous lesions are rare in patients with AIDS and other related immunodeficiency states, as the patients do not have adequate numbers of CD+ve T-cells to mount a granulomatous response to &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; infection in CNS and other organs and tissues. A perivascular cuffing with amoebae in necrotic tissue is usual finding in the AIDS and related T-cell immunodeficiency conditions.

Brain biopsy normally reveals severe oedema and hemorrhagic necrosis. A patient who has contracted this illness usually displays subacute symptoms, including altered mental status, headaches, fever, neck stiffness, seizures, and focal neurological signs (such as cranial nerve palsies and coma), all leading to death within one week to several months. Due to the rarity of this parasite and a lack of knowledge, no good diagnoses or treatments for &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; infection are now known. &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; keratitis cases in the past have resolved from a therapy consisting of atropine and some other drugs with no antimicrobial effects. Recent publications show atropine to interfere with the protist&#x27;s CHRM1 receptor, causing cell death.

Infection usually mimics that of bacterial leptomeningitis, tuberculous meningitis, or viral encephalitis. The misdiagnosis often leads to erroneous, ineffective treatment. In the case that the &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; is diagnosed correctly, the current treatments, such as amphotericin B, rifampicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, sulfadiazine, or albendazole, are only tentatively successful. Correct and timely diagnosis, as well as improved treatment methods and an understanding of the parasite, are important factors in improving the outcome of infection by &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot;. A paper published in 2013 has shown substantial effects of some FDA-approved drugs with an &quot;in vitro&quot; kill rate above 90%. These results were &quot;in vitro&quot; effects, but as the drugs are already approved, human infections can be targeted after dose calculations in clinical trials done with these diverse groups of drugs.

===Acanthamoebic keratitis===

When present in the eye, &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; strains can cause acanthamoebic keratitis, which may lead to corneal ulcers or even blindness. This condition occurs most often among contact lens wearers who do not properly disinfect their lenses, exacerbated by a failure to wash hands prior to handling the lenses. Multipurpose contact lens solutions are largely ineffective against &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot;, whereas hydrogen peroxide-based solutions have good disinfection characteristics.

The first cure of a corneal infection was achieved in 1985 at Moorfields Eye Hospital.

In May 2007, Advanced Medical Optics, manufacturer of Complete Moisture Plus Contact Lens Solution products, issued a voluntary recall of their Complete Moisture Plus solutions. The fear was that contact lens wearers who used their solution were at higher risk of acanthamoebic keratitis than contact lens wearers who used other solutions. The manufacturer recalled the product after the Centers for Disease Control in the United States found that 21 people had possibly received an &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; infection after using Complete Moisture Plus in the month prior to diagnosis.

===As a bacterial reservoir ===
Several species of bacteria that can cause human disease are also able to infect and replicate within &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; species. These include &quot;Legionella pneumophila&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, and some strains of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. For some of these bacteria, replication inside &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; has been associated with enhanced growth in macrophages, and increased resistance to some antibiotics. Furthermore, due to the high prevalence of &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; in the environment, these amoebae have been proposed to serve as an environmental reservoir for some human pathogens.

==Ecology==
&quot;A. castellanii&quot; can be found at high densities in various soil ecosystems. It preys on bacteria, but also fungi and other protozoa.

This species is able to lyse bacteria and produce a wide range of enzymes, such as cellulases or chitinases, and probably contributes to the breakdown of organic matter in soil, contributing to the microbial loop.

==Physiology==

===Role as a model organism===
Because &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; does not differ greatly at the ultrastructural level from a mammalian cell, it is an attractive model for cell-biology studies; it is important in cellular microbiology, environmental biology, physiology, cellular interactions, molecular biology, biochemistry, and evolutionary studies, due to the organisms&#x27; versatile roles in the ecosystem and ability to capture prey by phagocytosis, act as vectors and reservoirs for microbial pathogens, and to produce serious human infections. In addition, &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; has been used extensively to understand the molecular biology of cell motility and cancer cell dormancy by in-depth exploration of the process of encystation.

The recently available &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; genome sequence revealed several orthologs of genes employed in meiosis of sexual eukaryotes. These genes included &quot;Spo11, Mre11, Rad50, Rad51, Rad52, Mnd1, Dmc1, Msh&quot;, and &quot;Mlh&quot;. This finding suggests that &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; is capable of some form of meiosis and may be able to undergo sexual reproduction. Furthermore, since &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; diverged early from the eukaryotic family tree, these results suggest that meiosis was present early in eukaryotic evolution.

Owing to its ease and economy of cultivation, the Neff strain of &quot;A. castellanii&quot;, discovered in a pond in Golden Gate Park in the 1960s, has been effectively used as a classic model organism in the field of cell biology. From just 30 L of simple medium inoculated with &quot;A. castellanii&quot;, about 1 kg of cells can be obtained after several days of aerated culture at room temperature. Pioneered in the laboratory of Edward D. Korn at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), many important biological molecules have been discovered and their pathways elucidated using the &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; model. Thomas Dean Pollard applied this model at the NIH, Harvard Medical School, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies to discover and characterize many proteins that are essential for cell motility, not only in amoebae, but also in many other eukaryotic cells, especially those of the human nervous and immune systems, the developing embryo, and cancer cells. &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; also has served as a model to study the evolution of certain G-proteins. This unicellular eukaryote expresses few GPCRs over its cell membrane that serve vital role for the microorganism, structural homology bioinformatics tools have been used to show the presence of a homolog of human M1-muscarinic receptor in &quot;A. castellanii&quot;. Blocking these muscarinic receptors in past studies has proven to be amoebicidal in Acanthamoeba spp. More recently, voltage-gated calcium channels in &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; spp. (CavAc) have been reported to have similarities with human voltage-gated calcium channels such as TPC-1 and L-type calcium channels and respond to Ca-channel blockers such as loperamide. This model microbe has been studied to understand complex neurodegenerative states including Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Scientists have isolated a neurotransmitter acetylcholine in &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; and the enzymatic machinery needed for its synthesis.

===Endosymbionts===

&quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; spp. contain diverse bacterial endosymbionts that are similar to human pathogens, so they are considered to be potential emerging human pathogens. The exact nature of these symbionts and the benefit they represent for the amoebic host still have to be clarified. These include &quot;Legionella&quot; and &quot;Legionella&quot;-like pathogens.

===Giant viruses===

The giant viruses &quot;Mimivirus, Megavirus&quot;, and &quot;Pandoravirus&quot; infect &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot;.

Members of the genus &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; are unusual in serving as hosts for a variety of giant viruses (that have more than 1000 protein-coding genes; for instance, &quot;Pandoravirus&quot;, which has about 2500 protein-coding genes in its genome).

==Diversity==
&quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; can be distinguished from other genera of amoebae based on morphological characteristics. However, differentiating one species of &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; from another by morphology has proven difficult. Based on 18S rDNA sequencing, known &quot;Acanthamoeba&quot; strains can be organized into 12 groups, denoted T1-T12. Most disease-causing isolates belong to type T4.

== Etymology ==
From the Greek &quot;akantha&quot; (spike/thorn), which was added before &quot;amoeba&quot; (change) to describe this organism as having a spine-like structure (acanthopodia). This organism is now well known as Acanthamoeba, an amphizoic, opportunistic, and nonopportunistic protozoan protist widely distributed in the environment.

<doc id="369869" wikidata="Q1503490" url="?curid=369869" title="Elon Peace Plan">
<text>The so-called Elon Peace Plan (also formerly &quot;The Right Road to Peace&quot;; now &quot;The Israeli Initiative&quot;) is a plan to resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict through the principles of rehabilitation of Palestinian refugees, Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territories (West Bank and, at the time, the Gaza Strip), and strategic cooperation with Jordan, based on Jordan becoming a Palestinian state. 

==History==
The plan was originally proposed in 2002 by then-Israeli tourism minister Rabbi Binyamin Elon. It advocates the formal annexation of West Bank and Gaza by Israel, the Palestinians becoming citizens of Jordan, which would become a Palestinian state, with their final status to be negotiated. The Palestinian refugee camps would be dismantled, and the Palestinian refugees would be fully absorbed into their host countries. Elon and Moledet (Elon&#x27;s party and the chief supporter of this plan) proposed that &quot;Israel, the United States and the international community will allocate resources for the completion of the exchange of populations that began in 1948 and the full rehabilitation of the refugees and their absorption and naturalization in various countries&quot;.

Elon continued to advance his plan, including a 2004 visit to Jordan for this purpose, but did not manage to win substantial support for it.

General public support for Elon and his plan in Israel can be gleaned from his party&#x27;s election results: the National Union received 5.5% support on the Israeli legislative election of 2003 (which went up to 7.14% in the 2006 election after the party&#x27;s merger with the National Religious Party).

The changing political climate in Israel following the 2006 Lebanon war and the Hamas takeover of the Gaza strip prompted Elon to resume advancing his plan in 2007, complete with a million-dollar advertising campaign, as &quot;The Israeli Initiative – The Right Road for Peace&quot;. Similar in principle to his original proposition, this new formulation gave up on the idea of a Palestinian state being formed in Jordan; while it still has Israel annexing the West Bank, it proposes that the Palestinians would become citizens of Jordan and residents of Israel rather than being re-located (though it also advocates providing them with a financial incentive to leave of their own accord). This idea directly opposes the direction taken by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and the Kadima-Labor coalition, which aims to negotiate with the Palestinians with the ultimate goal of establishing a Palestinian state.

==Pro arguments==
The case presented by proponents of the plan is that Israel, the Palestinians, Jordan and other moderate Arab states would all benefit from such a solution. Ideally, Israel could see a sharp drop in terrorist attacks and the dissipation of the demographic threat; Millions of Palestinians would turn from refugees to citizens and would be given new economical opportunities; and the abolition of the Palestinian state would prevent an extremist threat to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, while international financial support and increased co-operation with Israel would provide financial growth and opportunities (which, to a lesser degree, applies to other Arab states as well). Republican US Senator and former presidential candidate Sam Brownback has expressed support of the plan.

==Counter arguments==
In an essay titled &quot;The Yamin [right-wing] Israel Plan&quot;, Prof. Paul Eidelberg wrote that &quot;Even if [the Palestinians] were made Jordanian citizens, as proposed by the otherwise meritorious Elon Plan, it is wishful thinking to believe they will live in peace with the Jews in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza&quot;.

It usually depicts human nudity or sexual activity, and has included works in various visual mediums, including drawings, engravings, films, video games, paintings, photographs, and sculptures. Some of the earliest known works of art include erotic themes, which have recurred with varying prominence in different societies throughout history. However, it has also been widely considered taboo, with either social norms or laws restricting its creation, distribution, and possession. This is particularly the case when it is deemed pornographic, immoral, or obscene.

==Definition==

The definition of erotic art can be subjective because it is dependent on context, as perceptions of what is &quot;erotic&quot; and what is &quot;art&quot; vary. A sculpture of a phallus in some cultures may be considered a traditional symbol of potency rather than overtly erotic. Material that is produced to illustrate sex education may be perceived by others as inappropriately erotic. &quot;The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot; defines erotic art as &quot;art that is made with the intention to stimulate its target audience sexually, and that succeeds to some extent in doing so&quot;.

A distinction is often made between erotic art and pornography, which also depicts scenes of sexual activity and is intended to evoke erotic arousal. Pornography is not usually considered fine art. People may draw a distinction based on the work&#x27;s intent and message: erotic art would be works intended for purposes in addition to arousal, which could be appreciated as art by someone uninterested in their erotic content. US Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart wrote in 1964 that the distinction was intuitive, saying about hard-core pornography which would not be legally protected as erotic art, &quot;I know it when I see it&quot;.

Others, including philosophers Matthew Kieran and Hans Maes, have argued that no strict distinction can be made between erotic art and pornography.

==Historical==



Among the oldest surviving examples of erotic depictions are Paleolithic cave paintings and carvings, but many cultures have created erotic art. Artifacts have been discovered from ancient Mesopotamia depicting explicit heterosexual sex. Glyptic art from the Sumerian Early Dynastic Period frequently shows scenes of frontal sex in the missionary position. In Mesopotamian votive plaques from the early second millennium BC, the man is usually shown entering the woman from behind while she bends over, drinking beer through a straw. Middle Assyrian lead votive figurines often represent the man standing and penetrating the woman as she rests on top of an altar.
Scholars have traditionally interpreted all these depictions as scenes of ritual sex, but they are more likely to be associated with the cult of Inanna, the goddess of sex and prostitution. Many sexually explicit images were found in the temple of Inanna at Assur, which also contained models of male and female sexual organs, including stone phalli, which may have been worn around the neck as an amulet or used to decorate cult statues, and clay models of the female vulva.
Depictions of sexual intercourse were not part of the general repertory of ancient Egyptian formal art, but rudimentary sketches of heterosexual intercourse have been found on pottery fragments and in graffiti. The Turin Erotic Papyrus (Papyrus 55001) is an by Egyptian papyrus scroll discovered at Deir el-Medina, the last two-thirds of which consist of a series of twelve vignettes showing men and women in various sexual positions. The men in the illustrations are &quot;scruffy, balding, short, and paunchy&quot; with exaggeratedly large genitalia and do not conform to Egyptian standards of physical attractiveness. The women are nubile, and they are shown with objects from traditional erotic iconography, such as convolvulus leaves. In some scenes, they hold items traditionally associated with Hathor, the goddess of love, such as lotus flowers, monkeys, and sacred instruments called sistra. The scroll was probably painted in the Ramesside period (1292–1075 BC) and its high artistic quality indicates that was produced for a wealthy audience. No other similar scrolls have been discovered.

The ancient Greeks painted sexual scenes on their ceramics, many of them famous for being some of the earliest depictions of same-sex relations and pederasty, and there are many sexually explicit paintings on the walls of ruined Roman buildings in Pompeii. The Moche of Peru are another ancient people who sculpted explicit scenes of sex into their pottery. There is an entire gallery devoted to pre-Columbian erotic ceramics (Moche culture) in Lima at the Larco Museum. Edward Perry Warren adapted a love for Greek Art during college and collected Greek erotic art pieces that often represented gay sexual relationships, such as the Warren Cup, a Greco-Roman drinking cup which features scenes of anal sex between males. Many of Warren&#x27;s eclectic pieces collected over the years are in the Boston Museum of Fine Art.

Caliph Al-Walid II, who ruled the Umayyad Caliphate in the 8th century, was a great patron of erotic art. Among the depictions of the Qusayr Amra, which were built by him, is the abundance of naked females and love scenes.

There is a long tradition of erotic art in Eastern cultures. In Japan, for example, shunga appeared in the 13th century and continued to grow in popularity until the late 19th century when photography was invented. In Japan during the Edo period (1600–1869), Shunga, translated to &quot;spring pictures&quot;, was a series of sexually explicit paintings created with ink or woodblock works that became printed onto paper scrolls as an introduction to sexual education. Shunga, embraced by individuals as part of the Shinto religion, focused on liberating the innate sexual beings that are within all humans, including women and homosexual sexuality. Couples engaging in sexual acts were shown laughing and enjoying the sexual encounter with their partner; this focused on the positivity of sex.

Around 1700, shunga was met with opposition and banned in Japan, but the circulation of this prominent Erotic Art continued. Shunga could be found in local libraries and homes of many Japanese citizens. Similarly, the erotic art of China(known as Chungongtu) reached its popular peak during the latter part of the Ming dynasty. In India, the famous &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; is an ancient sex manual that is still popularly read throughout the world.

In Europe, starting with the Renaissance, there was a tradition of producing erotica for the amusement of the aristocracy. &quot;I Modi&quot; was an erotic book with engravings of sexual scenes by Marcantonio Raimondi that were based on designs by Giulio Romano. &quot;I Modi&quot; was thought to be created in around 1524 to 1527.

In 1601, Caravaggio painted the &quot;Amor Vincit Omnia&quot; for the collection of the Marquis Vincenzo Giustiniani.

An erotic cabinet, ordered by Catherine the Great, seems to have been adjacent to her suite of rooms in the Gatchina Palace. The furniture was eccentric, with tables that had large penises for legs. Penises and vaginas were carved on the furniture and the walls were covered in erotic art. The rooms and the furniture were seen in 1941 by two Wehrmacht-officers but they seem to have vanished since then. A documentary by Peter Woditsch suggests that the cabinet was in the Peterhof Palace and not in Gatchina.

The tradition was continued by other, more modern painters, such as Fragonard, Courbet, Millet, Balthus, Picasso, Edgar Degas, Toulouse-Lautrec and Egon Schiele. Schiele served time in jail and had several works destroyed by the authorities for offending contemporary mores with his depictions of nude girls.

By the 20th century, photography became the most common medium for erotic art. Publishers like Taschen mass-produced erotic illustrations and erotic photography.

== 20th century onwards ==

Many erotic artists worked in the 2010s. Much of the genre is still not as well accepted as the more standard genres of art such as portraiture and landscape. Erotic depictions in art went through a fundamental repositioning over the course of the 20th century. Early 20th century movements in art such as cubism, futurism, and German expressionism explored the erotic through manipulating the nude to explore multiple viewpoints, colour experimentation, and the simplification of the figure into geometrical components.

In the mid 20th century, realism and surrealism offered new modes of representation of the nude. For surrealist artists, the erotic became a way of exploring ideas of fantasy, the unconscious and the dream state. Artist&#x27;s such as Paul Delvaux, Giorgio de Chirico and Max Ernst are well-known surrealist artist&#x27;s that dealt with the erotic directly. In the aftermath of the First World War, a shift away from abstracted human figures of the 1920s and 1930s towards realism took place. Artists such as British artist Stanley Spencer led this re-appropriated approach to the human figure in Britain, with naked self-portraits of himself and his second wife in erotic settings This is explicitly evident in his work &quot;Double nude portrait,&quot; 1937.

The naked portrait was arguably becoming a category of erotic art that was dominating the 20th century, just as the academic nude had dominated the 19th century. Critical writings on the &#x27;nude&#x27; and in particular the female &#x27;nude&#x27;, meant fundamental shifts in how depictions of the nude and the portrayal of sexuality were being considered. Seminal texts such as British Art historian Kenneth Clark&#x27;s &quot;The nude: a study of ideal art&quot; in 1956 and Art Critic John Berger in 1972 in his book &quot;Ways of Seeing,&quot; were re-examining the notion of the naked and the nude within art. This period in art was defined by an acute engagement with the political. It marked a historical moment that stressed the importance of the sexual revolution upon art.

The 1960s and 1970s were a time of social and political change across the United States and Europe. Movements included the fight for equality for women with a focus on sexuality, reproductive rights, the family, and the workplace. Artists and historians began to investigate how images in Western art and the media, were often produced within a male narrative and particularly how it perpetuated idealisations of the female subject. The questioning and interrogation of the overarching male gaze within the historical art narrative, manifested in both critical writing and artistic practice, came to define much of the mid to late 20th century art and erotic art. American Art Historian Carol Duncan summarises the male gaze and its relationship to erotic art, writing &quot;More than any other theme, the nude could demonstrate that art originates in and is sustained by male erotic energy. This is why many &#x27;seminal&#x27; works of the period are nudes.&quot; Artists such as Sylvia Sleigh is an example of this reversal of the male gaze as her work depicts male sitters presented in traditional erotic reclining poses that usually were reserved for the female nude as part of the &#x27;odalisque&#x27; tradition.

The rise of feminism, the sexual revolution and conceptual art in the mid 20th century meant that the interaction between the image and audience, and the artist and audience, were beginning to be questioned and redefined, opening up new possible areas of practice. Artists began to use their own nude bodies and began to depict an alternative narrative of the erotic, through new lenses. New media was beginning to be used to portray the nude and the erotic, with performance and photography being used by women artists, to draw attention to issues of gender power relations and the blurred boundaries between pornography and art. Artists such as Carolee Schneemann, and Hannah Wilke were using these new mediums to interrogate the constructs of gender roles and sexuality. Wilke&#x27;s photographs, for instance, satirised the mass objectification of the female body in pornography and advertising.

Performance art since the 1960s has flourished and is considered as a direct response and challenge to traditional types of media and was associated with the dematerialization of the artwork or object. As performance that dealt with the erotic flourished in the 1980s and 1990s both male and female artists were exploring new strategies of representation of the erotic.

Martha Edelheit was a female artist known for her contributions to erotic art as a rebellious stance against typical gender roles, which excluded women artists from participating in free sexual expression. This limited women to often be the subject of many famous Erotic Art pieces which catered to men. Edelheit was criticized for being a female artist who created erotic artwork during a time where men were main contributors in this art. Edelheit was a pioneer in the feminist art movement because she was a woman who created erotic art and also depicted herself in many of her works, which paved the way for women&#x27;s equality in sexual expression.

Edelheit confronted the common stereotype that this art was pornographic by offering an alternative view of oneself. Her works paved the way for women to openly express sexual desires. Painting nude male subjects were uncommon in the 1970s; her Art turned the tables and allowed for women to be at the forefront of this fem expression revolution that occurred in the 70s.

The acceptance and popularity of erotic art has pushed the genre into mainstream pop-culture and has created many famous icons. Frank Frazetta, Luis Royo, Boris Vallejo, Chris Achilleos, and Clyde Caldwell are among the artists whose work has been widely distributed. The Guild of Erotic Artists was formed in 2002 to bring together a body of like-minded individuals whose sole purpose was to express themselves and promote the sensual art of erotica for the modern age.

Between 2010 and 2015 sexologist and gallerist Laura Henkel, curator of the Erotic Heritage Museum and the Sin City Gallery, organised 12 Inches of Sin, an exhibition focussing on art that expresses a diverse view of sexuality and challenging ideas of high and low art. The erotic continues to be explored and employed in new types of art work today and the profound developments of the 20th century still underpin much of the prevailing erotic art and artistic intent.

==Legal standards==
Whether or not an instance of erotic art is obscene depends on the standards of the jurisdiction and community in which it is displayed.

In the United States, the 1973 ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States in &quot;Miller v. California&quot; established a three-tiered test to determine what was obscene—and thus not protected, versus what was merely erotic and thus protected by the First Amendment.

Delivering the opinion of the court, Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote, 
The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether &#x27;the average person, applying contemporary community standards&#x27; would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.
As this is still much vaguer than other judicial tests within U.S. jurisprudence, it has not reduced the conflicts that often result, especially from the ambiguities concerning what the &quot;contemporary community standards&quot; are. Similar difficulties in distinguishing between erotica and obscenity have been found in other legal systems.

<text>Matriculation is the formal process of entering a university, or of becoming eligible to enter by fulfilling certain academic requirements such as a matriculation examination.

==Australia==
In Australia, the term &quot;matriculation&quot; is seldom used now. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, all states replaced the matriculation examination with either a certificate, such as the Higher School Certificate (HSC) in Victoria and New South Wales, or a university entrance exam such as the Tertiary Entrance Exam in Western Australia. These have all been renamed (except in New South Wales) as a state-based certificate, such as the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE) or the Western Australian Certificate of Education (WACE).

Some Catholic university colleges in Australia have reintroduced matriculation ceremonies. New students at the College of St John the Evangelist within the University of Sydney and new students at Campion College Australia sign the college register during a formal ceremony whilst wearing academic dress.

==Bangladesh==
In Bangladesh, the &quot;Matriculation&quot; is the Secondary School Examination (SSC) taken at year 10, and the Intermediate Exams is the Higher Secondary Examination (HSC) taken at year 12. Bangladesh, like the rest of Indian sub-continent, still uses terms such as Matriculation Exams and Intermediate Exams taken from the days of the British Raj although in England itself these terms were replaced by &#x27;O&#x27; or Ordinary Level Examinations (now called GCSEs) and &#x27;A&#x27; or Advanced Level Examinations respectively.

==Brazil==

In Brazilian Portuguese, the word refers to the act of enrolling in an educational course, whether it be elementary, high school, college or post-graduate education.

==Canada==
In Canada, the term is used by some older universities to refer to orientation (&quot;frosh&quot;) events, however some universities, including University of King&#x27;s College, still hold formal Matriculation ceremonies. The ceremony at King&#x27;s is quite similar to the matriculation ceremonies held in universities such as Oxford or Cambridge. Trinity College at the University of Toronto also holds formal matriculation ceremonies, during which time incoming students are required to sign a matriculation register, making the practice the closest in format to that conducted by Oxford and Cambridge colleges of any university in North America. &quot;F!rosh Week&quot; at the University of Toronto&#x27;s Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering also begins with a distinct Matriculation ceremony held at the university&#x27;s Convocation Hall; though, there is no matriculation register to be signed, and the event is held by the student-run University of Toronto Engineering Society (through their Orientation Committee) rather than officially by the faculty. It is also where first-year engineering students take the &quot;Hardhat Oath,&quot; a modified version of the Rifleman&#x27;s Creed. At McGill University in Montreal, matriculation ceremonies have been substantially stripped down since the 1990s, although a speech by the Principal, typically held at Molson Stadium, to the incoming class is still a ritualized annual tradition.
In Ontario during the era with grade 13, satisfactory completion of grade 12 was considered junior matriculation and satisfactory completion of grade 13 was senior matriculation. In Nova Scotia, at the present time, Junior matriculation is grade 11 and senior matriculation is completion of grade 12.

==Czech Republic==
At Charles University in Prague, the oldest and most prestigious university in the Czech Republic, matriculation is held at the Great Hall (&quot;Magna Aula&quot;). The ceremony is attended by students commencing their studies. It is intended as a demonstration of the adoption of student&#x27;s duties and obtaining of student&#x27;s rights. The ceremony itself involves students taking the Matriculation Oath of the university and symbolically touching the faculty mace and shaking the dean&#x27;s hand.

Other Czech universities hold ceremonies similar to the one just described.

==Denmark==
In Denmark, the University of Copenhagen holds a matriculation ceremony each year. The ceremony is held in the Hall of Ceremony in the main building of the university. The ceremony begins with a procession with the rector and the deans in academic dress and other regalia. The ceremony continues with the rector listing the different faculties, after which the different student, shouts when their respective faculty is mentioned. The rector then delivers a speech, after which the rector and the deans leave the ceremony again in procession, after which a party is held on university grounds, to mark the admission of the new students.

==Finland==

In Finland, Matriculation (Finnish: &quot;Ylioppilastutkinto&quot;, Swedish: &quot;Studentexamen&quot;) is the examination taken at the end of Secondary education to qualify for entry into University. In practice the test also constitutes the high school&#x27;s final exams, although there is a separate diploma on graduating from high school, based not on the exam, but on the grades of individual courses. Since 1919, the test has been arranged by a national body, the Matriculation Examination Board. Before that, the administration of the test was the responsibility of the University of Helsinki (which until 1918 was the only university in Finland).

==Germany==
The German term &quot;Immatrikulation&quot; describes the administrative process of enrolling at university as a student. This can happen for winter semester and, depending on the degree program, also for summer semester. It does not involve a ceremony. A prerequisite for matriculation is generally the &quot;Abitur&quot;, which is the standard matriculation examination in Germany, for regular universities and &quot;Fachhochschulreife&quot; for &quot;Fachhochschulen&quot; (Universities of Applied Sciences). Both &quot;Abitur&quot; and &quot;Fachhochschulreife&quot; are school leaving certificates which students receive after passing their final examinations at some types of German secondary schools.

==Hong Kong==

In Hong Kong, the term is used interchangeably with the completion of sixth-form. After sitting for the Certificate of Education examinations, eligible students receive two years of sixth-form education, upon completion, they sit for the A-level examinations. Most secondary schools offer the sixth-form programme, and there are also a few sixth-form colleges. Students obtaining good grades in the A-level examinations will be admitted to a university. The education reforms of Hong Kong in the 2000s have replaced the fourth- and fifth-form education, which prepared students for the HKCEE, and the sixth-form education with a three-year senior secondary education, which leads to the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination. The last sixth-form students graduated and took the A-level examinations in 2012; in the same year the first students studying the new senior secondary curriculum graduated and took the first HKDSE examinations.

==India==
In India, &quot;matriculation&quot; is a term commonly used to refer to the final results of the 10th class, which ends at tenth 
Board (tenth grade), and the qualification consequently received by passing the national board exams or the state board exams, commonly called &quot;matriculation exams&quot;.

India still uses terms such as Matriculation Exams and Intermediate Exams for Class 10th and Class 12th Board Exams respectively, taken from the days of British rule although in England these terms have been replaced by &#x27;O&#x27; or Ordinary Level Examinations (now called GCSEs) and &#x27;A&#x27; or Advanced Level Examinations.

English is the standard language for matriculation for science subjects, while regional languages are also an option. Most students who pass matriculation, or class 10, are 15–16 years old. Upon successfully passing, a student may continue onto the Higher secondary school. Most students who pass class 12 are 17–18 years old. The CBSE and ICSE boards conduct twelfth standard courses nationally, while state boards operate at the state-level. Although the basic curriculum is prescribed by the CBSE &amp; almost all the competitive exams for entering in various universities in India are based on CBSE syllabus, various scholarships are also provided to students appearing for matriculation exams like NTSE, NSO, NSTSC etc.

==Malaysia==

In Malaysia, matriculation programmes are run by public universities and the Ministry of Education (MoE). Matriculation programmes offered by public universities offer fewer options for further study upon completion of the said program as they are limited to that particular university.

The matriculation programme provided by the MoE is a one-year pre-U program sponsored by the Malaysian government. SPM (Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia or the Malaysian Certificate of Education) holders can apply for MoE Matriculation during their SPM year [Form 5]. Students that are offered the matriculation programme will be posted to several Matriculation Colleges within Malaysia.

After MoE Matriculation, they can further their studies in local universities within Malaysia. Several universities in United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand recognize the MoE Matriculation as a pre-U qualification.

Apart from the matriculation programmes, there is the STPM programme ([Sijil Tinggi Pelajaran Malaysia] or Malaysian Higher School Certificate), the standardised national examinations taken by Form 6 students. STPM is different from the matriculation programme in terms of its duration (2 years vs. 1 year), syllabus (breadth and depth), marking method (standardised assessment nationwide vs. assessment by matriculation college itself) and passing rate.

==Nepal==

In Nepal, it refers to the School Leaving Certificate (SLC) before now it is known as Secondary education examination (SEE) (As per new education act 2016) taken at year 10, before Intermediate Exams (Higher Secondary or 10+2) taken in subsequent two years prior to university entry. School leaving certificate (SLC) or Secondary education examination (SEE) is the main examination which is also called &quot;Iron gate&quot; in Nepal. Although SLC and 10+2 are widely used, some educational institutions follow the British system with O&#x27; or Ordinary Level Examinations (now called GCSE) and A&#x27; or Advanced Level Examinations respectively.

==Netherlands==
In the Netherlands high school is vertically segregated into several levels of education. Most students enter university after a specific high-school track, the pre-university education (&quot;Voorbereidend Wetenschappelijk Onderwijs&quot;). This track is concluded by the Central Exam (matriculation examination) regulated by Dutch law. After three years of the pre-university education program, high-school students select one of four directions (roughly corresponding to languages, humanities and economics, biology and medicine, and hard sciences), the last three years of the pre-university education program is meant to prepare for university education within that direction.

==Pakistan==

In Pakistan, matriculation (usually referred to as &quot;matric&quot;) is the term that refers to the final examinations that take place at the end of 9th and 10th grades. These examinations are usually taken up by students aged 14 to 16 years.

It results in the issuance of Secondary School Certificate (SSC) or Technical School Certificate (TSC). After the SSC (or TSC), students may proceed for 11th year of education at a higher secondary school. After successful completion of 11th (HSSC-1) and 12th (HSSC-2) years in college, they get the Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSSC) and become eligible to enter universities in Pakistan or in other countries. Pakistan still uses terms such as &quot;Matriculation Exams&quot; and &quot;Intermediate Exams&quot; taken from the days of British rule, although in England itself these terms were replaced with &#x27;O&#x27; or Ordinary Level Examinations (now called GCSEs) and &#x27;A&#x27; or Advanced Level Examination.
==South Africa==

In South Africa, matriculation (or matric) is the final year of high school and the qualification received on graduating from high school, and the minimum university entrance requirements. The first formal examination was conducted in South Africa under the University of the Cape of Good Hope in 1858.

South African universities do not set their own entrance examinations, although many use standardized entrance tests of linguistic, numerical and mathematical ability, called the National Benchmark Tests, split into the AQL Test (Academic and Quantitative Literacy) and the Mathematics Test.

==United Kingdom==
In the British universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Royal Agricultural University, St Andrews, Edinburgh, Durham, and the New College of the Humanities, the term is used for the ceremony at which new students are entered into the register (in Latin &quot;matricula&quot;) of the university, at which point they become members of the university. Oxford requires matriculants to wear academic dress with subfusc during the ceremony. At Cambridge and Durham, policy regarding the wearing of academic dress varies amongst the colleges. Separate matriculation ceremonies are held by some of the colleges in Durham. Also at Durham, not all students are entered into the register, but one person from each college is selected to sign their own name for the whole college. At the University of St Andrews as well as the other ancient universities of Scotland, matriculation involves signing the Sponsio Academica, a pledge to abide by university rules and to support the institution. In 2015, Bishop Grosseteste University Lincoln introduced a Matriculation event for all new students.

Matriculation was a factor in the creation of UK examining boards such as the Joint Matriculation Board.

At most British universities there is no formal ceremony. The term &quot;matriculation&quot; is not used by many, with the terms &quot;enrolment&quot; and &quot;registration&quot; being more commonly employed to describe the administrative process of becoming a member of the university.

At Oxford and Cambridge, matriculation was formerly associated with entrance examinations taken before or shortly after matriculation, known as Responsions at Oxford and the Previous Examination at Cambridge, both abolished in 1960. University-wide entrance examinations were subsequently re-introduced at both universities, but abolished in 1995. More limited subject-based tests have since been introduced.

==United States==
At most universities and colleges in the United States, &quot;matriculation&quot; refers to mere enrollment or registration as a student at a university or college by a student intending to earn a degree, an event which involves no special ceremony.

Some colleges that have a formal matriculation ceremony and name it as such, while others call this enrollment ceremony for new students a &quot;convocation&quot;. A few colleges, such as Trinity College in Connecticut, use both terms, referring to the gathering as a convocation and the formal signing in as a student as the matriculation.

At some institutions, these ceremonies are relatively new. Scripps College&#x27;s matriculation began only in 1990. Others, like at Trinity College are nearly two centuries old, first occurring in 1826.

Colleges that specifically have a &quot;matriculation&quot; ceremony and specifically use this name include: Adrian College, Albion College, Assumption College, Belmont University, Boston College, Boston University, The Citadel, Culver-Stockton College, Dartmouth College, Duquesne University,Jacksonville University, Kenyon College, Lawrence University, Lyon College, Marietta College, McKendree University, Mount Union College, Moravian College, Muhlenberg College, Randolph-Macon College, Rice University, Saint Lawrence University, Scripps College, Trinity College, Tufts University, the University of Saint Mary (Kansas), Virginia Military Institute, Wabash College, Walsh University, Washington and Jefferson College, and Willamette University. 

Many medical schools highlight matriculation with a white coat ceremony. This is a relatively recent phenomenon, originating at University of Chicago&#x27;s Pritzker School of Medicine in 1989. The first full-fledged ceremony was at the Columbia University&#x27;s Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1993.

===Special student===
Universities and colleges in the United States commonly have a category of students known as special students, non-matriculated students or non-matriculating students. Generally these are students who are not merely auditing a class, but receive credit which is potentially transferable, pay full tuition, and often receive benefits that other students receive such as access to facilities and health care. These students typically are enrolled as matriculated students at other institutions and are visiting scholars of some type. However, sometimes students attend classes for the purpose of a standalone non-degree education.

<text>The snowy plover (Anarhynchus nivosus) is a small shorebird found in the Americas. It is a member of the bird family Charadriidae, which includes the plovers, dotterels, and lapwings. The snowy plover was originally described by John Cassin in 1858, but was classified as a subspecies of the Kentish plover in 1922. Since 2011, the snowy plover has been recognized as a distinct species based on genetic and anatomical differences from the Kentish plover. Two or three subspecies are recognized, distributed along the Pacific coast of North America, Ecuador, Peru, and Chile, in several inland areas of the US and Mexico, along the Gulf Coast, and on Caribbean islands. The coastal populations consist of both residential and migratory birds, whereas the inland populations are mostly migratory. It is one of the best studied endemic shorebirds of the Americas, and one of the rarest.

Snowy plovers are pale brown above and white below, with a white band on the hind neck. During the breeding season, males have black patches behind the eye and on the side of the neck; the neck patches are separated from each other and do not form a continuous breast band as in many other plovers. Snowy plovers can also be distinguished from other plovers in having an all-black and slender bill, and gray to black legs. The typical call is a repeated &quot;tu-wheet&quot;.

This plover inhabits open areas in which vegetation is absent or sparse, in particular coastal sand beaches and shores of salt or soda lakes, where it feeds on invertebrates such as crustaceans, worms, beetles, and flies. At the beginning of the breeding season, males excavate multiple nest scrapes that are advertised to females; one of these scrapes is later selected for breeding. Some females will desert their brood soon after the chicks hatch to re-mate with another male, while their first mate will continue to rear the chicks. Such polygamy is uncommon in birds, and is possibly a strategy to maximize breeding success. There are more males than females – 1.4 times as many in California – and the more pronounced this sex ratio imbalance is, the more females engage in polyandrous behavior.

The snowy plover is listed as near threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. The main threats are habitat destruction due to invasive beach grasses, urban development, as well as frequent disturbance due to recreational uses of beaches. Conservation measures on the US Pacific coast include roping-off beach areas that are used for breeding, the removal of invasive beach grasses, and protection against egg predators. While such measures have been successful locally, the global population is thought to be in decline.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The snowy plover was first described by John Cassin in 1858 as &quot;Aegialitis nivosa&quot;, based on a skin collected in 1854 by William P. Trowbridge in Presidio, which later became part of San Francisco. This skin, the holotype of the species, was subsequently lost. Although originally part of the collection of the National Museum of Natural History, it was given to the collector Henry E. Dresser of England in 1872. In 1898, the Dresser collection was transferred to the Victoria University of Manchester, but the skin was apparently not part of this transfer. Joseph Grinnell, who attempted to locate the holotype in 1931, suggested that Dresser may have been unaware of the specimen&#x27;s significance and may have given it elsewhere. The snowy plover is one of the best-studied endemic shorebirds of the Americas, although most of this research was carried out on western North American populations, with few monitoring programs targeting the South American and eastern North American populations.

Plovers (Charadriinae) are a subfamily of small shorebirds that breed in open habitats on all continents except Antarctica. Together with the lapwings (Vanellinae), they form the family Charadriidae. The snowy plover was traditionally considered to be a species within the genus &quot;Charadrius&quot;, which comprised 32 extant species and was therefore the most species-rich genus of the family. However, a 2013 genetic analysis found that the lapwings are nested within &quot;Charadrius&quot;; the latter is therefore polyphyletic (is not a natural group, i.e., the most distantly related &quot;Charadrius&quot; species are more closely related to lapwings than to each other). Some subsequent studies confirmed this and proposed to split &quot;Charadrius&quot; into five separate genera. The snowy plover, formerly &quot;Charadrius nivosus&quot;, was transferred into the genus &quot;Anarhynchus&quot;, as &quot;Anarhynchus nivosus&quot;, along with 22 other plover species; in 2023, this transfer was recognized by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union. Before the transfer, &quot;Anarhynchus&quot; contained only one species, the wrybill from New Zealand. The name &quot;Anarhynchus&quot; derives from the Ancient Greek () meaning and () meaning . The species name is Latin for .

The snowy plover appears to be most closely related to the Kentish, the white fronted, the Malaysian, the chestnut-banded, and the red-capped plover, as shown in a cladogram from a 2015 study:


The snowy plover is closely related, and visually similar, to the Kentish plover of Eurasia and Africa. Harry C. Oberholser, in 1922, argued that the differences in plumage between these species are not consistent, and no clear line of demarcation could be drawn. Consequently, he classified the two subspecies of the snowy plover that were recognized at that time (&quot;nivosus&quot; and &quot;tenuirostris&quot;) as subspecies of the Kentish plover. This assessment was subsequently followed by most authors, until a 2009 genetic study re-established the snowy plover as a separate species. This study noted that, besides differences in the mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, snowy plovers differ from Kentish plovers in being smaller, having shorter and wings, different chick plumages, and different advertisement calls of the males. In 2011, the International Ornithological Congress (IOC) and the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union (AOU) recognized them as separate species.

=== Subspecies ===

Two to three subspecies are commonly recognized:

*&quot;Anarhynchus nivosus nivosus&quot; : The nominate subspecies, found in North America west of Louisiana.

*&quot;Anarhynchus nivosus tenuirostris&quot; : The Cuban snowy plover, found in North America east of Louisiana. The distinction of this subspecies from the &quot;nivosus&quot; subspecies is contested, but two genetic analyses in 2007 and 2020 have supported its separation.

*&quot;Anarhynchus nivosus occidentalis&quot; : Found on the Pacific coast of South America. It is slightly larger than the nominate subspecies, the (the area between eye and beak) is white, and the black patch on the forehead is slightly broader.

A 2020 study suggested that the snowy plover populations can be subdivided into four distinct demes (groups of individuals more genetically similar to each other than to other individuals): The western &quot;nivosus&quot; deme in western North America, the eastern &quot;nivosus&quot; deme in Florida, the &quot;tenuirostris&quot; deme on the Caribbean islands and Bermuda, and the &quot;occidentalis&quot; deme in South America. The study found little genetic exchange between these demes, except for a strong migration from the western to the eastern &quot;nivosus&quot; deme (but not vice versa).

==Description==
The snowy plover is a plump shorebird with a large head, a short and slender bill, and short neck and tail. It is a small plover, with adults ranging from in length, from in wingspan, and from in weight. Its body is typically held horizontally. Compared to other plovers, its legs are relatively long and its wings short. The bill is black, the iris dark brown, and the legs gray to black.
Snowy plovers are pale brown above and white below, with a white band on the hind neck and a smudgy (absent in the South American subspecies). Breeding males have black patches behind the eye (&quot;ear patch&quot;), on the sides of the neck, and on the forehead. In males, the may be reddish at the start of the breeding season. The breeding female is slightly duller, and typically one or more of the patches are partly or completely brown. The neck patches on each side are well separated and rarely joined at the front, giving the appearance of a &quot;broken&quot; breast band in contrast to the continuous breast band in many other plovers. Outside the breeding season, the neck and ear patches are pale and the forehead patch is absent, and plumages of males and females cannot be distinguished. Newly hatched chicks have pale upper sides with brown to black spots and are white below.

Similar species within its range include the piping plover, the collared plover, the semipalmated plover, and Wilson&#x27;s plover. Amongst other features, the snowy plover differs from these species in its slender and entirely black bill (shorter and thicker in piping plover and longer and thicker in Wilson&#x27;s plover, and with orange base in piping and breeding semipalmated plover), in its gray to black legs (orange or yellow in piping, collared, and semipalmated plover), and the &quot;broken&quot; breast band (usually complete in semipalmated, Wilson&#x27;s, and breeding collared plovers).

=== Vocalizations ===

The typical call is a repeated &quot;tu-wheet&quot; given in a wide range of contexts. In males, these include advertisement while standing in territories and courtship. In both sexes, the call may be given in situations of threat, aggression, distress, and alarm. This call differs between sexes, being shorter, quieter, and hoarser in the female. Other calls include a repeated &quot;purrt&quot; that is given during breeding season, for example while flying from nest sites or when other plovers intrude their territory. A single &quot;churr&quot; is mostly given by males while defending territory or offspring from other plovers. Outside the breeding season, a repeated &quot;ti&quot; is given when disturbed while resting, and is often followed by flight. Chicks make a &quot;peep&quot; call from up to two days before hatching while still in the egg, and until their first flight.

==Distribution and habitat==

The snowy plover is distributed along the Pacific coast of North and South America, in areas inland of the US and Mexico, along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, and on the Caribbean islands and Bermuda. On the Pacific coast, it breeds from south Washington down to Oaxaca in Mexico, and non-breeding individuals can be found as far south as Panama. In South America, it breeds from south Ecuador to Chiloé Island in Chile. In the Caribbean, breeding occurs eastwards as far as the Virgin Islands and Margarita Island. The coastal populations consist of both migratory and residential birds; migration occurs over relatively short distances north- or southward along the coast. Inland breeding populations exist in the US eastward to the Great Plains of Kansas and Oklahoma, as well as in Mexico north of Mexico City. These populations are mostly migratory, with western populations migrating to the Pacific coast, and the Great Plains populations to the Gulf of Mexico coast. Breeding has been recorded at elevations up to .

The species inhabits open areas in which vegetation is absent or sparse, in particular coastal sand beaches and shores of salt or soda lakes. It also breeds on river bars that are located close to the coast, and adopts human-made habitats such as wastewater and salt evaporation ponds, dammed lakes, and dredge spoils. It requires the proximity of water, although it may breed on salt flats where only very little water remains.

==Behavior and ecology==
===Feeding===

The species feeds on invertebrates such as crustaceans, worms, beetles, and flies. An analysis of feces from a coastal population in California during breeding season found beetles in 72%, flies in 44%, and insect larvae in 25% of the feces. Prey is taken from above and below the sand surface, from plants, and from carcasses. In inland habitats, snowy plovers usually forage on wet substrates that may be under a shallow water cover. As is typical for plovers, prey is found visually by briefly standing to scan the area, followed by running and capturing. Snowy plovers also forage by probing the substrate with their bills, by charging or hopping into accumulations of flies, and by &quot;foot trembling&quot; on wet substrates or in shallow water, where one foot shakes to stir up prey. Brine fly larvae are often shaken before consumption, and captured flies are often bitten two or three times. Snowy plovers may forage during day and night, with one individual observed feeding in almost complete darkness. Snowy plovers drink when fresh water is available, but when it is not, they can sustain themselves on the water content of their prey.

===Territoriality and roosting===

At the beginning of the breeding season, the male, while still unpaired, will establish and defend a territory, which is then advertised to a female by calling and excavating scrapes. A pair will continue to defend the territory. After the chicks hatch, the family will soon begin to move around, when the adults will defend the surrounding radius rather than a fixed territory. When defending a territory, males may attempt to intimidate intruders by using the &quot;Upright Display&quot; posture, in which the body is upright with erected breast feathers. They may also run or fly at, or fight with intruders. Fighting may involve jumping at each other breast-to-breast with flapping wings and mutual pecking and shoving. In some cases, combatants pull on each other&#x27;s feathers, and may even pull out a tail feather. Fights with intermittent short breaks can last up to 1.5 hours. Territories are defended not only against other snowy plovers but also against some other bird species, including semipalmated plovers and whimbrels. Territories are probably not important for protecting food resources, as the plovers often feed in flocks up to away from their territories. In Kansas and Oklahoma, where the birds are more stationary, protection of feeding grounds could be more important. The size of territories is variable, and sizes between have been reported.

Outside the breeding season, snowy plovers will often roost in groups of several to more than 300 birds. Roosting places are typically on the ground, often in depressions such as footprints (including those of humans) and vehicle tracks or behind objects such as driftwood.

===Breeding===
Snowy plovers are facultatively polygamous, with females, and less frequently males, often abandoning their mate soon after the chicks have hatched. The deserting female will then pair with a new male and renest, sometimes a few hundred kilometers away from its first brood, while the male will continue to rear the chicks. A 2021 study of a population at , Mexico, found that females are more likely to abandon their broods when the chicks are likely to survive even in their absence, or when the chicks have a low probability of survival. The polygamy in this species could therefore be a strategy to maximize breeding success. Polygamy is most pronounced where the breeding season is long, when birds may start two, and sometimes three, broods per season. On the other hand, birds do generally not brood twice in the Great Plains, where the breeding season is short. A biased sex ratio also appears to favor polygamy: males are generally more common than females, with one study reporting that males were 1.4 times more common than females in California. The causes for such pronounced sex ratios are unknown. Rarely, males breed with two females at the same time. Pairs can also be reestablished in the next breeding season, which occurred in 32 to 45% of cases in central California, or within the same season in the third breeding attempt of the female. The polygamous mating system of the snowy plover is uncommon in birds, but the closely related Kentish plover shows a similar behavior.

Snowy plovers nest in nest scrapes that are excavated by the male as an important part of the courtship ritual. In the coastal areas of California, males excavated an average of 5.6 scrapes per territory. A scrape may be constructed within a few minutes, often near conspicuous landmarks such as rocks and grass patches. One of these scrapes is later selected by the pair for nesting, commonly the scrape where most copulations took place. Both before and during incubation, the adults continue to line the nest with small objects such as stones and shell pieces. Where the ground is too hard to construct scrapes, other depressions such as animal and vehicle tracks are chosen.

The species lays three eggs on average, but clutch size ranges from two to six eggs. When only a single egg is produced, the clutch is usually abandoned. Eggs are oval or asymmetric in shape and have a matte and smooth surface. In coastal California, they average at in length, in width, and in weight, which accounts for 20% of the body weight of the female. Egg color is brownish-yellow, with dark brown or black speckles that become more numerous towards the blunt end of the egg. The female lays one egg every 47 to 118 hours until the clutch is complete. The time interval between egg laying and hatching varies geographically and seasonally, ranging between 23 and 49 days. Continuous incubation starts upon clutch completion; while still incomplete, males and females spend only about a quarter of the daytime incubating. In coastal areas of California, females tend to incubate during the day, while males incubate at night. The reason for this pattern is unclear, and hypotheses include a need of the female to feed at night to regain energy lost from egg laying and the need of the male to defend the territory during daytime. Under hot conditions greater , the male and female take turns at least once per hour.

A day before hatching, chicks and parents begin to communicate by calling. After hatching, the parents will carry eggshells away from the nest. The chicks are precocial and able to walk and swim one to three hours after hatching. Parents do not feed their chicks, but will lead them to feeding areas. Parents will continue to brood their chicks after hatching – in the coastal areas of northern California, chicks less than 10 days old were brooded for an average of 58% of each day. In western North America, chicks are looked after for 29 to 47 days after hatching, often by the male after the female has deserted. In the more eastern populations, however, chicks are often cared for until they fledge.

===Predators and mortality===

Adults are preyed upon by birds of prey and various mammals including feral cats and foxes, with a wider range of predators preying on chicks and eggs. Adults will usually run away from an approaching predator or human, but may also take flight. Approaching birds of prey cause adults to duck on their nests, while roosting flocks will take flight to form a highly coordinated flight formation in which they move back and forth. Parents will signal their chicks to lie flat against the ground when sensing potential danger. They may then attempt to distract predators from their chicks by calling and flying around. Parents also use injury feigning, when they will run away and move their wings as if they are broken, or lie on the ground while crouching or flapping.

Common diseases include botulism, and common parasites include bird lice. The average life span has been estimated at 2.7 years, and the oldest snowy plover on record was at least 15 years old.

== Status and conservation ==

The snowy plover is among the rarest endemic shorebirds in the Americas. Since 2014, it is listed as &quot;Near Threatened&quot; by the IUCN because of a moderately rapid population decline caused primarily by habitat degradation and human disturbance. In the US Pacific coast, the species is thought to have lost 50 out of 78 breeding sites since 1970, and in the Great Plains of Texas, the decline is estimated to have been larger than 75% between 1998 and 2009. Subtropical and tropical populations, although less studied and monitored than those of higher latitudes, may be similarly threatened. As of 2020, the global population is estimated at 24,000 to 31,000 mature individuals. Counting both juveniles and mature individuals, the North American population has been estimated at 25,869; the population in and around the Gulf of Mexico at 2,500; and the South American population at 8,000 to 10,000 individuals.

=== Causes of decline ===

Habitat degradation is a major cause for the declines in both coastal and inland populations in the US. Many coastal beaches have been developed for recreational use. Periodic raking of beaches to remove garbage and natural debris such as kelp causes plovers to abandon breeding areas, and reduces biodiversity and biomass of the invertebrates the plovers feed on. Dune habitat was lost to the invasive European beachgrass, which had originally been planted to stabilize dunes. This species, as well as the American beachgrass from the Atlantic coast, have replaced native foredune vegetation in most of the North American Pacific coast. In the Great Salt Plains in Oklahoma, controlled flooding, as well as an invasive shrub, the French tamarisk, have destroyed much plover habitat. In the Great Plains of Texas, sinking groundwater levels due to water extraction has been identified as the primary cause of decline. River habitats in Kansas and Oklahoma have been decimated by the extraction of water, the erection of water reservoirs, and vegetation growth. Habitat is lost to housing and urbanization adjacent to beaches. Less significant are habitat losses due to the trapping of sediments by dams and jetties that affect coastal erosion and sedimentation. Habitat degradation is also a major concern for populations of lower altitudes. For example, around Ceuta in Mexico, the species is affected by large-scale removal of protected mangrove forests and illegal development of beaches, but also by the spread of mangroves into abandoned evaporation ponds that were adopted as habitats by the plovers. A 2017 analysis concluded that the Ceuta population will probably be extinct in 25 years if no further conservation measures are implemented.
On US beaches, disturbance by humans and dogs is another significant cause for the abandonment of areas. One 2001 study found that at a public beach at Coal Oil Point, each plover was disturbed every 27 minutes on average during weekends and every 43 minutes during the week. The study further found that the plovers have been more sensitive to dogs than to humans, and that most disturbances occurred when the plovers were approached by less than . A 2003 study of two beaches at Point Reyes National Seashore found that chick mortality was 69% greater on weekends compared to weekdays in 1999 and 72% greater in 2000, demonstrating the negative effects of human recreation. Nests have also been directly crushed by vehicles, walking humans, and, in inland populations, by cattle. An experiment with quail eggs at Sands Beach in Santa Barbara County, California, revealed an 8% daily risk of eggs being trampled by humans when outside protected areas.

Several additional threats have been documented. Predation on chicks and eggs by crows, ravens, skunks, and invasive red foxes has intensified in some areas. Crows and ravens may be attracted to plover breeding areas by human food sources. Several instances have been documented where environmental pollution affected populations. Oil spills have been a repeated threat, such as the New Carissa spill of 1999 that is known to have killed a minimum of 45 plovers. At Point Reyes National Seashore, mercury contamination has been identified as the cause for a high proportion of unhatched eggs. A 2018 study found that 98% of analyzed plovers in the Southern Great Plains had blood selenium levels exceeding the toxicity threshold. Discarded monofilament fishing lines are a known threat, but their impact on populations is unknown. In the future, effects of climate change, such as droughts and habitat loss due to sea level rise, are likely to become significant threats.

=== Conservation measures ===

In 1993, the Pacific coast population of the US was listed as a &quot;threatened&quot; under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, and a recovery plan followed in 2007. The plan focuses on three main conservation measures: closure of upper beach areas to the public during breeding season; protection against predators; and habitat restoration. Closure of beach areas was most effective when including fencing against dogs and a 30 m buffer zone. Egg predators were controlled by both fencing individual nests and predator removal. Habitat restoration focused on the removal of the invasive European beachgrass. Measures are also in place to protect some other snowy plover habitats elsewhere in the US. In the Great Salt Plains in Oklahoma, dams and fences were erected around nesting areas to prevent flooding and predation, but proved ineffective. In Mexico, the species has been listed as &quot;threatened&quot; since 2010.
Even though the global population is declining, conservation efforts have led to local increases in plover populations. In central Chile, protection of a small stretch of beach against human disturbance resulted in an increase of the local population, as was reported in 2001. The first instance of snowy plovers reoccupying a breeding area following its protection from human disturbance was documented in 2006 at Sands Beach, Santa Barbara County, where barriers are in use since 2001. As of March 2023, conservation efforts have been particularly successful in Oregon, where numbers increased to 483 birds, from just 55 birds in 1993. This increase was possible due to roping off of dry sand on beaches, as well as the removal of invasive grasses. In California, the population is estimated at 1,830 birds as of March 2023.

<text>Nesebar (often transcribed as Nessebar and sometimes as Nesebur, , pronounced ) is an ancient city and one of the major seaside resorts on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast, located in Burgas Province. It is the administrative centre of the homonymous Nesebar Municipality. Often referred to as the &quot;Pearl of the Black Sea&quot;, Nesebar is a rich city-museum defined by more than three millennia of ever-changing history. The small city exists in two parts separated by a narrow human-made isthmus with the ancient part of the settlement on the peninsula (previously an island), and the more modern section (i.e., hotels and later development) on the mainland side. The older part bears evidence of occupation by a variety of different civilisations over the course of its existence.

It is one of the most prominent tourist destinations and seaports on the Black Sea, in what has become a popular area with several large resorts—the largest, Sunny Beach, is situated immediately to the north of Nesebar.

Nesebar has on several occasions found itself on the frontier of a threatened empire, and as such it is a town with a rich history. Due to the city&#x27;s abundance of historic buildings, UNESCO came to include Nesebar in its list of World Heritage Sites in 1983.

As of December 2019, the town has a population of 13,600 inhabitants.

==Name==
The settlement was known in Greek as &quot;Mesembria&quot; (), sometimes mentioned as &quot;Mesambria&quot; or &quot;Melsembria&quot;, the latter meaning the city of Melsas. According to a reconstruction the name might derive from Thracian &quot;Melsambria&quot;. Nevertheless, the Thracian origin of that name seems to be doubtful. Moreover, the tradition pertaining to Melsas, as founder of the city is tenuous and belongs to a cycle of etymological legends abundant among Greek cities. It also appears that the story of Melsas was a latter reconstruction of the Hellenistic era, when Mesembria was an important coastal city.

Before 1934, the common Bulgarian name for the town was Месемврия, &quot;Mesemvriya&quot;. It was replaced with the current name, which was previously used in the Erkech dialect spoken close to Nesebar. Both forms are derived from the Greek Mesembria.

==History==

Bulgarian archaeologist Lyuba Ognenova-Marinova led six underwater archaeological expeditions for the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (BAS) between 1961 and 1972 in the waters along the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast. Her work led to the identification of five chronological periods of urbanization on the peninsula surrounding Nesebar through the end of the second millennium B.C., which included the Thracian protopolis, the Greek colony Mesambria, a Roman-ruled village to the Early Christian Era, the Medieval settlement and a Renaissance era town, known as Mesembria or Nessebar.

Engineering around the peninsula coastline was undertaken in 1980s both to preserve the coastline (and its historic significance) and to consolidate the area as a port.

===Antiquity===

Originally a Thracian settlement, known as &quot;Mesembria&quot;, the town became a Greek colony when settled by Dorians from Megara at the beginning of the 6th century BC, then known as Mesembria. It was an important trading centre from then on and a rival of Apollonia (Sozopol). It remained the only Dorian colony along the Black Sea coast, as the rest were typical Ionian colonies. At 425-424 BC the town joined the Delian League, under the leadership of Athens.

Remains date mostly from the Hellenistic period and include the acropolis, a temple of Apollo and an agora. A wall which formed part of the Thracian fortifications can still be seen on the north side of the peninsula.

Bronze and silver coins were minted in Mesembria since the 5th century BC and gold coins since the 3rd century BC. The town fell under Roman rule in 71 BC, yet continued to enjoy privileges such as the right to mint its own coinage.???

===Medieval era===

It was one of the most important strongholds of the Eastern Roman Empire from the 5th century AD onwards, and was fought over by Byzantines and Bulgars, being captured and incorporated in the lands of the First Bulgarian Empire in 812 by Khan Krum after a two-week siege only to be ceded back to Byzantium by Knyaz Boris I in 864 and reconquered by his son Tsar Simeon the Great. During the time of the Second Bulgarian Empire it was also contested by Bulgarian and Byzantine forces and enjoyed particular prosperity under Bulgarian tsar Ivan Alexander (1331–1371) until it was conquered by Crusaders led by Amadeus VI, Count of Savoy in 1366. The Bulgarian version of the name, &quot;Nesebar&quot; or &quot;Mesebar&quot;, has been attested since the 11th century.

Monuments from the Middle Ages include the 5–6th century &quot;Stara Mitropoliya&quot; (&quot;old bishopric&quot;; also St Sophia), a basilica without a transept; the 6th century church of the Virgin; and the 11th century &quot;Nova Mitropoliya&quot; (&quot;new bishopric&quot;; also St Stephen) which continued to be embellished until the 18th century. In the 13th and 14th century a remarkable series of churches were built: St Theodore, St Paraskeva, St Michael St Gabriel, and St John Aliturgetos.

The city was conquered by the Ottomans during the Bulgarian-Ottoman wars, but was then returned to the Byzantine Empire by the terms of the 1403 Treaty of Gallipoli.

===Ottoman rule===
The capture of the town by the Ottoman Empire in 1453 marked the start of its decline, but its architectural heritage remained and was enriched in the 19th century by the construction of wooden houses in style typical for the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast during this period. At the early 19th century many locals joined the Greek patriotic organization, Filiki Eteria, while at the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence (1821) part of the town&#x27;s youth participated in the struggle under Alexandros Ypsilantis.

Nesebar (Misivri) was a kaza centre in İslimye sanjak of Edirne Province before 1878.

===Third Bulgarian state===
After the Liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule in 1879, Nesebar became part of the autonomous Ottoman province of Eastern Rumelia in Burgaz department until it united with the Principality of Bulgaria in 1885.
Around the end of the 19th century Nesebar was a small town of Greek fishermen and vinegrowers. In 1900 it had a population of approximately 1.900, of which 89% were Greeks, but it remained a relatively empty town. It developed as a key Bulgarian seaside resort since the beginning of the 20th century. After 1925 a new town part was built and the historic Old Town was restored.

==Churches==
Nesebar is sometimes said to be the town with the highest number of churches per capita., Today, a total of forty churches survive, wholly or partly, in the vicinity of the town. Some of the most famous include:
* the Church of St Sophia or the Old Bishopric (&quot;Stara Mitropoliya&quot;) (5th–6th century)
* the Basilica of the Holy Mother of God Eleusa (6th century)
* the Church of John the Baptist (11th century)
* the Church of St Stephen or the New Bishopric (&quot;Nova Mitropoliya&quot;) (11th century; reconstructed in the 16th–18th century)
* the Church of St Theodore (13th century)
* the Church of St Paraskevi (13th–14th century)
* the Church of the Holy Archangels Michael and Gabriel (13th–14th century)
* the Church of Christ Pantocrator (13th–14th century)
* the Church of St John Aliturgetos (14th century)
* the Church of St Spas (17th century)
* the Church of St Clement (17th century)
* the Church Assumption of the Holy Virgin (19th century)

Whether built during the Byzantine, Bulgarian or Ottoman rule of the city, the churches of Nesebar represent the rich architectural heritage of the Eastern Orthodox world and illustrate the gradual development from Early Christian basilicas to medieval cross-domed churches.

== Sports ==

; Football

The local team of PFC Nesebar participates in the Second Professional Football League. The stadium capacity is 6000 spectators, field dimensions are 100/50 m and some complementary fields are available for rent or practicing.

; Tennis

There are many possibiltes to play tennis in the area during the summer season. The two main clubs with outdoor and indoor courts are TC Egalite and Tennis academy Nesebar.

==Namesakes==

<text>Armalcolite () is a titanium-rich mineral with the chemical formula (Mg,Fe2+)Ti2O5. It was first found at Tranquility Base on the Moon in 1969 during the Apollo 11 mission, and is named for &quot;Arm&quot;strong, &quot;Al&quot;drin and &quot;Col&quot;lins, the three Apollo 11 astronauts. Together with tranquillityite and pyroxferroite, it is one of three new minerals that were discovered on the Moon. Armalcolite was later identified at various locations on Earth and has been synthesized in the laboratory. (Tranquillityite and pyroxferroite were also later found at various locations on Earth). The synthesis requires low pressures, high temperatures and rapid quenching from about 1,000 °C to the ambient temperature. Armalcolite breaks down to a mixture of magnesium-rich ilmenite and rutile at temperatures below 1,000 °C, but the conversion slows down with cooling. Because of this quenching requirement, armalcolite is relatively rare and is usually found in association with ilmenite and rutile, among other minerals.

==Occurrence==
Armalcolite was originally found on the Moon, in the Sea of Tranquility at Tranquility Base, and also in the Taurus–Littrow valley and the Descartes Highlands. The largest amounts were provided by the Apollo 11 and 17 missions. It was later identified on Earth from samples of lamproite dikes and plugs taken in Smoky Butte, Garfield County, Montana, US. On the Earth, it also occurs in Germany (Nördlinger Ries impact crater in Bavaria), Greenland (Disko Island), Mexico (El Toro cinder cone, San Luis Potosí), South Africa (Jagersfontein, Bultfontein and Dutoitspan kimberlite mines), Spain (Albacete Province and Jumilla, Murcia), Ukraine (Pripyat Swell), United States (Knippa quarry, Uvalde County, Texas and Smoky
Butte, Jordan, Montana) and Zimbabwe (Mwenezi District). Armalcolite was also detected in lunar meteorites, such as Dhofar 925 and 960 found in Oman.

Armalcolite is a minor mineral found in titanium-rich basalt rocks, volcanic lava and sometimes granite pegmatite, ultramafic rocks, lamproites and kimberlites. It is associated with various mixed iron-titanium oxides, graphite, analcime, diopside, ilmenite, phlogopite and rutile. It forms elongated crystals up to about 0.1–0.3 mm in length embedded in a basalt matrix. Petrographic analysis suggests that armalcolite is typically formed at low pressures and high temperatures.

==Synthesis==
Armalcolite crystals up to several millimeters in length can be grown by mixing powders of iron, titanium and magnesium oxides in the correct ratio, melting them in a furnace at about 1,400 °C, letting the melt crystallize for a few days at about 1,200 °C, and then quenching the crystals to the ambient temperature. The quenching step is required both for laboratory and natural synthesis in order to avoid conversion of armalcolite to a mixture of magnesium-rich ilmenite (Mg-) and rutile (TiO2) at temperatures below 1,000 °C. This conversion threshold temperature increases with pressure and eventually crosses the melting point, meaning that the mineral cannot be formed at sufficiently high pressures. Because of this conversion to ilmenite, armalcolite has a relatively low abundance and is associated with ilmenite and rutile. Consequently, the relative amount of ilmenite and armalcolite can be used as an indicator of the cooling rate of a mineral during its formation.

==Properties==

Armalcolite has a general chemical formula (Mg,Fe2+)Ti2O5. It forms opaque masses which appear gray (ortho-armalcolite) to tan (para-armalcolite) in reflection, with gray varieties being most common, especially in synthetic samples. The crystal structure is the same for the ortho- and para-armalcolite. Their chemical composition does not differ significantly, but there is a difference in the MgO and Cr2O3 content which was attributed to dissimilar coloration. Armalcolite is a part of the pseudobrookite group which consists of minerals of the general formula X2YO5. X and Y are usually Fe (2+ and 3+), Mg, Al, and Ti. End members are armalcolite ((Mg,Fe)Ti2O5), pseudobrookite (Fe2TiO5), ferropseudobrookite (FeTi2O5) and &quot;karrooite&quot; (MgTi2O5). They are isostructural and all have orthorhombic crystal structure and occur in lunar and terrestrial rocks.

Chemical composition of most armalcolite samples can be decomposed into a sum of metal oxides as follows: TiO2 (concentration 71–76%), FeO (10–17%), MgO (5.5–9.4%), Al2O3 (1.48–2%), Cr2O3 (0.3-2%) and MnO (0–0.83%). Whereas the titanium content is relatively constant, the ratio of magnesium to iron varies and is usually lower than 1. A so-called Cr-Zr-Ca variety of armacolite is distinguished which has an elevated content of Cr2O3 (4.3–11.5%), ZrO2 (3.8–6.2%) and CaO (3–3.5%). These varieties are not distinct and intermediate compositions are also found. The iron-poor (magnesium-rich) modification of armacolite has the same crystal structure and occurs in the Earth&#x27;s crust as the mineral unofficially named &quot;karrooite&quot;.

Most titanium is present in armalcolite in the 4+ state, owing to the reducing synthesis environment, but there is a significant fraction of Ti3+ in lunar samples. The Ti3+/Ti4+ ratio in armalcolite can serve as an indicator of fugacity (effective partial pressure) of oxygen during the mineral&#x27;s formation. It also allows one to distinguish lunar and terrestrial armalcolite, as Ti3+/Ti4+ = 0 for the latter.

Since armalcolite&#x27;s formula is (Mg,Fe2+)Ti2O5, it follows the general formula of XY2O5 where the X=(Mg and Fe2+), Y=Ti, and O is oxygen. Both X and Y sites are octahedrally coordinated and the radius ratio between the cations and the anions in armalcolite are at three to five ratio equaling 0.6 making the structure octahedral. Armalcolite is a titanium-rich mineral that falls under the magnesianferropseudobrookite mineral group with Fe2+Ti2O5 and MgTi2O5 as end members. Due to having octahedral symmetry, armalcolite has solid solution (cation substitution) between multiple elements Fe2+, Fe3+, Mg, Al, and Ti; this is because of their similarities in atomic radii and charge. The crystallographic structure exhibited by armalcolite is an orthombic-dipyramid, thus falls in the orthorhombic category and has a 2/m 2/m 2/m point group and space group of Bbmm. Inside the M1 sites for armalcolite it is ideal for iron to reside there due to the larger size of iron and for M2, magnesium and titanium have a distribution between the two sites. In the metal sites, titanium has an eightfold; magnesium and iron with a four coordination. The magnesium and iron ratio in armalcolite decreases with decreasing temperature from 0.81 at 1,200 °C to 0.59 at 1,150 °C. Once the armalcolite reaches 1,125 °C it is replaced with ilmenite, FeTiO3, which lacks both magnesium and iron.

The crystal structure of armalcolite is close to that of distorted brookite. It is based on deformed octahedra, with a titanium atom in the center and six oxygen atoms at the corners. Magnesium or iron ions are located in the interstitial sites; they do not contribute significantly to the lattice framework, which is held by Ti-O bonds via the corners of the octahedra. However, these ions affect optical properties, rendering the mineral opaque in contrast to the transparent titanium dioxide TiO2.

<text>Hēmi Tōpine Te Mamaku (died June 1887) was a Māori chief in the Ngāti Hāua-te-rangi iwi from the Whanganui region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island.

Te Mamaku was born probably in the late 18th century and raised in the Whanganui area. As tribal chief he commanded a pā at Tuhua, at a strategic position on the Ohura River, north of Taumarunui.

During the Musket Wars Te Mamaku was sometimes allied with Ngāti Toa chief Te Rauparaha and sometimes fought against him. At the outbreak of the Hutt Valley Campaign in 1846, he was firmly on the side of Te Rauparaha&#x27;s nephew Te Rangihaeata in resisting the encroachment of European settlers on to Māori land. On 16 May 1846, Te Mamaku led a force of about 200 warriors in a devastating surprise dawn attack on British troops at Boulcott&#x27;s Farm in the Hutt Valley. Afterwards, he sent letters to other chiefs in the Whanganui area urging them to join in the conflict. Some were intercepted and forwarded to the government, which may have precipitated George Grey&#x27;s decision to arrest Te Rauparaha.

Returning to Wanganui (then known as Petre) in September 1846, Te Mamaku told the 200 European settlers that he had no quarrel with them and would protect them from attack by other Māori, but that he would not tolerate the presence of government troops. The government sent troops there in December.

In April 1847, four Māori were hanged for the murder of the Gilfillan settler family. Te Mamaku believed they should have been handed over for tribal justice. Raids on the outlying farms intensified, and in May, Te Mamaku led a war party of up to 700 warriors that besieged the town. A battle on 20 July resulted in about a dozen casualties on each side, after which the siege was lifted and Te Mamaku returned to his stronghold in the Pipiriki area, up the Whanganui River.

Te Mamaku was baptised by Richard Taylor and took the baptismal name Hēmi Tōpine (James Stovin) on 25 December 1853.

In 1857, Te Mamaku was offered the Māori kingship, but declined. He did join the Kingitanga movement in 1858 in their opposition to the sale of Māori land. He did not get involved in the Battle of Moutoa Island, but was probably fighting alongside the Pai Mārire forces at Ōhoutahi in the Second Taranaki War.

Despite this, within a few years, he was regarded as a man of peace and had the respect of the government. He opposed Te Kooti but was firm in his belief that the King Country was sacrosanct Māori territory, even to the extent of executing one Pākehā man who persisted in entering the area. In 1880, he joined Te Keepa te Rangihiwinui in a trust to protect the Māori land of the upper Wanganui River from sale to the Pākehā.

In his later years, Te Mamaku appears to have accepted many of the changes that Europeanisation brought to his area. He died in June 1887 at Tāwhata, near Taumarunui.

<doc id="369961" wikidata="Q556880" url="?curid=369961" title="Smedley Butler">
<text>Smedley Darlington Butler (July 30, 1881June 21, 1940) was a United States Marine Corps officer and writer. During his 34-year military career, he fought in the Philippine–American War, the Boxer Rebellion, the Mexican Revolution, World War I, and the Banana Wars. At the time of his death, Butler was the most decorated Marine in U.S. military history. By the end of his career, Butler had received sixteen medals, including five for heroism; he is the only Marine to be awarded the Marine Corps Brevet Medal as well as two Medals of Honor, all for separate actions.

In 1933, Butler became involved in a controversy known as the Business Plot, when he told a United States congressional committee that a group of wealthy American industrialists were planning a coup d&#x27;état to overthrow President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Butler also claimed that the plotters of the alleged coup intended on using Butler, at the head of a group of veterans, to place the federal government under arrest. The individuals alleged to be involved in the coup all denied the existence of such a plot and the media ridiculed Butler&#x27;s allegations, but a final report following an investigation by a special House of Representatives committee confirmed at least some of his testimony.

After retiring from the Marine Corps, Butler became an outspoken critic of American foreign policy and military interventions, which he saw being driven primarily by U.S. business interests. In 1935, Butler wrote the book &quot;War Is a Racket&quot;, where he argued that imperialist motivations had been the cause behind several American interventions, many of which he personally participated in. Butler also became an advocate for populist politics, speaking at meetings organized by veterans, pacifists, and church groups until his death in 1940.

==Early life==
Smedley Darlington Butler was born July 30, 1881, in West Chester, Pennsylvania, the eldest of three sons. His parents, Thomas and Maud (née Darlington) Butler, were descended from local Quaker families. Both of his parents were of entirely English ancestry, and their families had been in North America since the 17th century. 

His father was a lawyer, a judge, and later served in the House of Representatives for 31 years, serving as chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee during the Harding and Coolidge administrations. Smedley&#x27;s Marine Corps career successes occurred while his father held that politically influential Congressional seat, controlling the Marine Corps manpower and budget. His maternal grandfather was Smedley Darlington, a Republican congressman from 1887 to 1891. His paternal grandfather was Samuel Butler, who served in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and served as Pennsylvania State Treasurer from 1880 to 1882. Butler&#x27;s childhood home is a registered landmark.

Butler attended the West Chester Friends Graded High School, followed by The Haverford School, a (then) Quaker-affiliated secondary school, popular with sons of upper-class Philadelphia families. He became captain of the school baseball team and quarterback of its football team. Against the wishes of his father, he left school 38 days before his seventeenth birthday to enlist in the Marine Corps during the Spanish–American War. Haverford awarded him his high school diploma, nevertheless, on June 6, 1898, before the end of his final year. His transcript stated that he completed the scientific course &quot;with Credit&quot;.

==Military career==

===Spanish–American War===
In the Spanish war fervor of 1898, Butler lied about his age to receive a direct commission as a Marine second lieutenant. He trained at Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C. In July 1898, he went to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, arriving shortly after its invasion and capture. His company soon returned to the U.S., and after a short break, he was assigned to the armored cruiser for four months. He came home to be mustered out of service in February 1899, but on April 8, 1899, he accepted a commission as a first lieutenant in the Marine Corps.

===Philippine–American War===

The Marine Corps sent him to Manila, Philippines. On garrison duty with little to do, Butler turned to alcohol to relieve the boredom. He once became drunk and was temporarily relieved of command after an unspecified incident in his room.

In October 1899, he saw his first combat action when he led 300 Marines to take the town of Noveleta from Filipino troops of the new Philippine republic. In the initial moments of the assault, his first sergeant was wounded. Butler briefly panicked, but he quickly regained his composure and led his Marines in pursuit of the fleeing enemy. By noon, the Marines had dispersed the native defenders and taken the town. One Marine had been killed, 10 were wounded, and another 50 had been incapacitated by the humid tropical heat.

After the excitement of this combat, garrison duty again became routine. He met Littleton Waller, a fellow Marine with whom he maintained a lifelong friendship. When Waller received command of a company in Guam, he was allowed to select five officers to take with him. Butler was amongst his choices. Before they had departed, their orders were changed, and they were sent to China aboard the to help put down the Boxer Rebellion.

===Boxer Rebellion===

Once in China, Butler was initially deployed in Tianjin (then often romanized as Tientsin). He took part in the Battle of Tientsin on July 13, 1900, and in the subsequent Gaselee Expedition, during which he saw the mutilated remains of Japanese soldiers. When he saw another Marine officer fall wounded, he climbed out of a trench to rescue him. Butler was then shot in the thigh. Another Marine helped him get to safety, but he was also shot. Despite his leg wound, Butler assisted the wounded officer to the rear. Four enlisted men would receive the Medal of Honor in the battle. Butler&#x27;s commanding officer, Major Waller, personally commended him and wrote that &quot;for such reward as you may deem proper the following officers: Lieutenant Smedley D. Butler, for the admirable control of his men in all the fights of the week, for saving a wounded man at the risk of his own life, and under a very severe fire.&quot; Commissioned officers were not then eligible to receive the Medal of Honor, and Butler instead received a promotion to captain by brevet while he recovered in the hospital, two weeks before his 19th birthday.

He was eligible for the Marine Corps Brevet Medal when it was created in 1921, and was one of only 20 Marines to receive it. His citation reads: 

===Banana Wars===
Butler participated in a series of occupations, &quot;police actions&quot;, and interventions by the United States in Central America and the Caribbean, later called the Banana Wars due to their goal of protecting American commercial interests in the region, particularly those of the United Fruit Company. This company had significant financial stakes in the production of bananas, tobacco, sugar cane, and other products throughout the Caribbean, Central America, and the northern portions of South America. The U.S. was also trying to advance its own political interests by maintaining its influence in the region and especially its control of the Panama Canal. These interventions started with the Spanish–American War in 1898 and ended with the withdrawal of troops from Haiti and President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Good Neighbor policy in 1934. After his retirement, Butler became an outspoken critic of the United States&#x27; business interests in the Caribbean, criticizing the ways in which American businesses and Wall Street bankers imposed their agenda on U.S. foreign policy.

====Honduras====
In 1903, Butler was stationed in Puerto Rico on Culebra Island. Hearing rumors of a Honduran revolt, the United States government ordered his unit and a supporting naval detachment to sail to Honduras, to the west, to defend the U.S. Consulate there. Using a converted banana boat renamed the &quot;Panther&quot;, Butler and several hundred Marines landed at the port town of Puerto Cortés. In a letter home, he describes the action: they were &quot;prepared to land and shoot everybody and everything that was breaking the peace&quot;, but instead found a quiet town. The Marines re-boarded the &quot;Panther&quot; and continued up the coastline, looking for rebels at several towns, but found none.

When they arrived at Trujillo, however, they heard gunfire and came upon a battle in progress that had been ongoing for 55 hours between rebels called &quot;Bonillista&quot; and Honduran government soldiers at a local fort. At the sight of the Marines, the fighting ceased, and Butler led a detachment of Marines to the American consulate, where he found the consul, wrapped in an American flag, hiding among the floor beams. As soon as the Marines left the area with the shaken consul, the battle resumed, and the Bonillistas soon controlled the government. During this expedition, Butler earned the first of his nicknames: &quot;Old Gimlet Eye&quot;. It was attributed to his feverish, bloodshot eyes (he was suffering from some unnamed tropical fever at the time) that enhanced his penetrating and bellicose stare.

====Marriage and business====
After the Honduran campaign, Butler returned to Philadelphia. He married Ethel Conway Peters of Philadelphia, a daughter of civil engineer and railroad executive Richard Peters, on June 30, 1905. His best man at the wedding was his former commanding officer in China, Lieutenant Colonel Littleton Waller. The couple eventually had three children, a daughter, Ethel Peters Butler, and two sons, Smedley Darlington Jr. and Thomas Richard.

Butler was next assigned to garrison duty in the Philippines, where he once launched a resupply mission across the stormy waters of Subic Bay after his isolated outpost ran out of rations. In 1908, he was diagnosed as having a nervous breakdown and received nine months sick leave, which he spent at home. He successfully managed a coal mine in West Virginia, but returned to active duty in the Marine Corps at the first opportunity.

====Central America====
From 1909 to 1912, Butler served in Nicaragua, enforcing U.S. policy. With a 104-degree fever, he led his battalion to the relief of the rebel-besieged city of Granada. In December 1909, he commanded the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment on the Isthmus of Panama. On August 11, 1912, he was temporarily detached to command an expeditionary battalion he led in the Battle of Masaya on September 19, 1912, and the bombardment, assault, and capture of Coyotepe Hill, Nicaragua, in October 1912. He remained in Nicaragua until November 1912, when he rejoined the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines at Camp Elliott, Panama. In private Butler was highly critical of the operation, writing to his parents:

What makes me mad is that the whole revolution is inspired and financed by Americans who have wild cat investments down here and want to make them good by putting in a Government which will declare a monopoly in their favor . . . The whole business is rotten to the core.

====Veracruz and first Medal of Honor====

Butler and his family were living in Panama in January 1914, when he was ordered to report as the Marine officer of a battleship squadron massing off the coast of Mexico, near Veracruz, to monitor a revolutionary movement. He did not like leaving his family and the home they had established in Panama, so he intended to request orders home as soon as he determined he was not needed.

On March 1, 1914, Butler and Navy Lieutenant Frank J. Fletcher (not to be confused with his uncle, Rear Admiral Frank F. Fletcher) &quot;went ashore at Veracruz, where they met the American superintendent of the Inter-Oceanic Railway and surreptitiously rode in his private car [a railway car] up the line 75 miles to Jalapa and back&quot;. A purpose of the trip was to allow Butler and Fletcher to discuss the details of a future expedition into Mexico. Fletcher&#x27;s plan required Butler to make his way into the country and develop a more-detailed invasion plan while inside its borders. It was a spy mission, and Butler was enthusiastic to get started. When Fletcher explained the plan to the commanders in Washington, DC, they agreed to it. Butler was given the go-ahead. A few days later, he set out by train on his spy mission to Mexico City, with a stopover at Puebla. He made his way to the U.S. Consulate in Mexico City, posing as a railroad official named &quot;Mr. Johnson&quot;.
* &quot;March 5&quot;. As I was reading last night, waiting for dinner to be served, a visitant, rather than a visitor, appeared in my drawing-room &quot;incognito&quot; – a simple &quot;Mr. Johnson,&quot; eager, intrepid, dynamic, efficient, unshaven! * * *

He and the chief railroad inspector scoured the city, saying that they were searching for a lost railroad employee; there was no lost employee, and in fact, the employee who they said was lost never existed. The ruse gave Butler access to various areas of the city. In the process of the so-called search, they located weapons in use by the Mexican army and determined the size of units and states of readiness. They updated maps and verified the railroad lines for use in an impending U.S. invasion. On March 7, 1914, he returned to Veracruz with the information he had gathered and presented it to his commanders. The invasion plan was eventually scrapped, when authorities loyal to Mexican General Victoriano Huerta detained a small American naval landing party (that had gone ashore to buy gasoline) in Tampico, Mexico, which led to what became known as the Tampico Affair.

When President Woodrow Wilson discovered that an arms shipment was about to arrive in Mexico, he sent a contingent of Marines and sailors to Veracruz to intercept it on April 21, 1914. Over the next few days, street fighting and sniper fire posed a threat to Butler&#x27;s force, but a door-to-door search rooted out most of the resistance. By April 26, the landing force of 5,800 Marines and sailors secured the city, which they held for the next six months. By the end of the conflict, the Americans reported 17 dead and 63 wounded; the Mexican forces had 126 dead and 195 wounded. After the actions at Veracruz, the U.S. decided to minimize the bloodshed and changed their plans from a full invasion of Mexico to simply maintaining the city of Veracruz. For his actions on April 22, Butler was awarded his first Medal of Honor. The citation reads:

After the occupation of Veracruz, an unusually high number of U.S. military personnel received the Medal of Honor. The Army presented one, nine went to Marines, and 46 were bestowed upon naval personnel. During World War I, Butler attempted to return his medal, explaining he had done nothing to deserve it. The medal was returned to him with orders to keep it and to wear it, as well.

====Haiti and second Medal of Honor====
In 1915, Haitian President Vilbrun Guillaume Sam was killed by a mob. In response, the United States ordered the to Haiti, with Major Butler and a group of Marines on board. On October 24, 1915, an estimated 400 &quot;Cacos&quot; ambushed Butler&#x27;s patrol of 44 mounted Marines when they approached Fort Dipitie. Surrounded by &quot;Cacos&quot;, the Marines maintained their perimeter throughout the night. The next morning, they charged the much-larger enemy force by breaking out in three directions. The startled Haitians fled. In early November, Butler and a force of 700 Marines and sailors returned to the mountains to clear the area. At their temporary headquarters base at Le Trou, they fought off an attack by about 100 &quot;Cacos&quot;. After the Americans took several other forts and ramparts during the following days, only Fort Rivière, an old, French-built stronghold atop Montagne Noire, was left.

For the operation, Butler was given three companies of Marines and some sailors from the USS &quot;Connecticut&quot;, about 100 men. They encircled the fort and gradually closed in on it. Butler reached the fort from the southern side with the 15th Company and found a small opening in the wall. The Marines entered through the opening and engaged the &quot;Cacos&quot; in hand-to-hand combat. Butler and the Marines took the rebel stronghold on November 17, 1915, an action for which he received his second Medal of Honor, as well as the Haitian Medal of Honor. The entire battle lasted less than 20 minutes. Reportedly, only one Marine was injured in the assault; he was struck by a rock and lost two teeth. About 50 Haitians in the fort were killed. Butler&#x27;s exploits impressed Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt, who recommended the award, based on Butler&#x27;s performance during the engagement. Once the medal was approved and presented in 1917, Butler achieved the distinction, shared with Dan Daly, of being the only Marines to receive the Medal of Honor twice for separate actions. The citation reads:

Subsequently, as the initial organizer and commanding officer of the Gendarmerie d&#x27;Haïti (the native police force), Butler established a record as a capable administrator. Under his supervision, social order, administered by the dictatorship, was largely restored. He recalled later that during his time in Haiti, he and his troops &quot;hunted the &quot;Cacos&quot; like pigs.&quot;

===World War I===

During World War I, Butler was (to his disappointment) not assigned to a combat command on the Western Front. He made several requests for a posting in France, writing letters to his personal friend, Wendell Cushing Neville. While Butler&#x27;s superiors considered him brave and brilliant, they described him as &quot;unreliable.&quot;

In October 1918, at the age of 37, he was promoted to the rank of brigadier general and placed in command of Camp Pontanezen at Brest, France, a debarkation depot that funneled troops of the American Expeditionary Force to the battlefields. The camp had been unsanitary, overcrowded, and disorganized. U.S. Secretary of War Newton Baker sent novelist Mary Roberts Rinehart to report on the camp. She later described how Butler tackled the sanitation problems. He began by solving the problem of mud. &quot;[T]he ground under the tents was nothing but mud, [so] he had raided the wharf at Brest of the duckboards no longer needed for the trenches, carted the first one himself up that four-mile hill to the camp, and thus provided something in the way of protection for the men to sleep on.&quot; Gen. John J. Pershing authorized a duckboard shoulder patch for the units. This earned Butler another nickname: &quot;Old Duckboard.&quot; For his exemplary service, he was awarded both the Army Distinguished Service Medal and the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, as well as the French Order of the Black Star. The citation for the Army Distinguished Service Medal states: The citation for the Navy Distinguished Service Medal states: 

===Quantico===

Following the war, he became commanding general of the Marine barracks at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. At Quantico, he transformed the wartime training camp into a permanent Marine post. He directed the Quantico camp&#x27;s growth until it became the &quot;showplace&quot; of the Corps. Butler won national attention by taking thousands of his men on long field marches (many of which he led from the front) to Gettysburg and other Civil War battle sites, where they conducted large-scale re-enactments before crowds of distinguished spectators.

In 1921, during a training exercise near the Wilderness battlefield in Virginia, he was told by a local farmer that Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s arm was buried nearby, to which he replied, &quot;Bosh! I will take a squad of Marines and dig up that spot to prove you wrong!&quot; Butler found the arm in a box. He later replaced the wooden box with a metal one and reburied the arm. He left a plaque on the granite monument marking the burial place of Jackson&#x27;s arm; the plaque is no longer on the marker, but it can be viewed at the Chancellorsville Battlefield visitor center.

===Philadelphia Director of Public Safety===
In 1924, newly elected Mayor of Philadelphia W. Freeland Kendrick asked President Calvin Coolidge to lend the city a military general to help him rid Philadelphia&#x27;s municipal government of crime and corruption. At the urging of Butler&#x27;s father, Coolidge authorized Butler to take the necessary leave from the Corps to serve as Philadelphia&#x27;s director of public safety, in charge of running the city&#x27;s police and fire departments from January 1924 until December 1925. He began his new job by assembling all 4,000 of the city police into the Metropolitan Opera House in shifts to introduce himself and inform them that things would change while he was in charge. Since he had not been given authority to fire corrupt police officers, he switched entire units from one part of the city to another, in order to undermine local protection rackets and profiteering.

Within 48 hours of taking over, Butler organized raids on more than 900 speakeasies, ordering that they be padlocked and destroyed in many cases. In addition to raiding the speakeasies, he also attempted to eliminate other illegal activities, including bootlegging, prostitution, gambling, and police corruption. More zealous than he was political, he ordered crackdowns on the social elite&#x27;s favorite hangouts, such as the Ritz-Carlton and the Union League, as well as on drinking establishments that served the working class. Although he was effective in reducing crime and police corruption, he was a controversial leader. In one instance, he made a statement that he would promote the first officer to kill a bandit and stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe there is a single bandit notch on a policeman&#x27;s guns in this city; go out and get some.&quot; Although many of the local citizens and police felt that the raids were just a show, they continued for several weeks.

Among his many accomplishments as the director of public safety, he implemented programs to improve city safety and security, established policies and guidelines for the administration, and developed a Philadelphia police uniform that resembled that of the Marine Corps. Other changes included military-style checkpoints into the city and bandit-chasing squads, who were armed with sawed-off shotguns and armored police cars. The press began reporting on both the good and the bad aspects of Butler&#x27;s personal war on crime. They praised the new uniforms, the new programs, and the reductions in crime, but they also reflected the public&#x27;s negative opinion of their new public safety director. Many felt that he was being too aggressive in his tactics and resented the reductions in their civil rights, such as the stopping of citizens at the city checkpoints. Butler frequently swore in his radio addresses, causing many citizens to suggest that his behavior, and particularly his language, was inappropriate for someone of his rank and stature. Some even suggested that Butler was acting like a military dictator, even charging that he wrongfully used active-duty Marines in some of his raids. Maj. R.A. Haynes, the federal prohibition commissioner, visited the city in 1924, six months after Butler was appointed. He announced that &quot;great progress&quot; had been made in the city, and he attributed that success to Butler.

Eventually, Butler&#x27;s leadership style and the directness of actions undermined his support within the community, so his departure seemed imminent. Mayor Kendrick reported to the press, &quot;I had the guts to bring General Butler to Philadelphia and I have the guts to fire him.&quot; Feeling that his duties in Philadelphia were coming to an end, Butler contacted Gen. Lejeune to prepare for his return to the Marine Corps. Not all of the citizens felt that Butler was doing a bad job, though, and when the news started to leak that he would be leaving, people began to gather at the Academy of Music. A group of 4,000 supporters assembled and negotiated a truce between him and the mayor to keep him in Philadelphia for a while longer, and the president authorized a one-year extension.

Butler devoted much of his second year to executing arrest warrants, cracking down on crooked police, and enforcing prohibition. On January 1, 1926, his leave from the Marine Corps ended, and the president declined a request for a second extension. Butler received orders to report to San Diego and prepared his family and his belongings for the new assignment. In light of his pending departure, he began to defy the mayor and other key city officials. On the eve of his departure, he had an article printed in the paper that stated his intention to stay and &quot;finish the job&quot;. The mayor was surprised and furious when he read the press release the next morning and demanded Butler&#x27;s resignation. After almost two years in office, Butler resigned under pressure, stating later that &quot;cleaning up Philadelphia was worse than any battle I was ever in.&quot;

===San Diego duty===
Following the period of service as the director of public safety in Philadelphia, Butler assumed command on February 28, 1926, of the U.S. Marine Corps base in San Diego, California, in ceremonies involving officers and the band of the 4th Marine Regiment.

===China and stateside service===
From 1927 to 1929, Butler was commander of a Marine Expeditionary Force in Tianjin, China, (the China Marines). While there, he cleverly parlayed his influence among various generals and warlords to the protection of U.S. interests, ultimately winning the public acclaim of contending Chinese leaders. When he returned to the United States in 1929 he was promoted to major general, becoming, at age 48, the youngest major general of the Marine Corps. But, the death of his father on May 26, 1928, ended the Pennsylvania Congressman&#x27;s ability to protect Smedley from political retribution for his outspoken views.

In 1931, Butler violated diplomatic norms by publicly recounting gossip about Benito Mussolini in which the dictator allegedly struck and killed a child with his speeding automobile in a hit-and-run accident. The Italian government protested and President Hoover, who strongly disliked Butler, forced Secretary of the Navy Charles Francis Adams III to court-martial him. Butler became the first general officer to be placed under arrest since the Civil War. He apologized to Secretary Adams and the court-martial was canceled with only a reprimand.

==Military retirement==

When Commandant of the Marine Corps Maj. Gen. Wendell C. Neville died July 8, 1930, Butler, at that time the senior major general in the Corps, was a candidate for the position. Although he had significant support from many inside and outside the Corps, including John Lejeune and Josephus Daniels, two other Marine Corps generals were seriously considered, Ben H. Fuller and John H. Russell Jr. Lejeune and others petitioned President Herbert Hoover, garnered support in the Senate and flooded Secretary of the Navy Charles Adams&#x27; desk with more than 2,500 letters of support. With the recent death of his influential father, however, Butler had lost much of his protection from his civilian superiors. The outspokenness that characterized his run-ins with the mayor of Philadelphia, the &quot;unreliability&quot; mentioned by his superiors when they were opposing Butler&#x27;s posting to the Western Front, and his comments about Benito Mussolini resurfaced. In the end the position of commandant went to Fuller, who had more years of commissioned service than Butler and was considered less controversial. Butler requested retirement and left active duty on October 1, 1931.

==Later years==
Even before retiring from the Corps, Butler began developing his post-Corps career. In May 1931 he took part in a commission established by Oregon Governor Julius L. Meier which laid the foundations for the Oregon State Police. He began lecturing at events and conferences, and after his retirement from the Marines in 1931 he took this up full time. He donated much of his earnings from his lucrative lecture circuits to the Philadelphia unemployment relief. He toured the western United States, making 60 speeches before returning for his daughter&#x27;s marriage to Marine aviator Lt. John Wehle. Her wedding was the only time he wore his dress blue uniform after he left the Marines.

===Senate campaign===
Butler announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate in the Republican primary in Pennsylvania in March 1932 as a proponent of Prohibition, known as a &quot;dry&quot;. Butler allied with Gifford Pinchot but was defeated in the April 26, 1932, primary election with only 37.5% of the vote to incumbent Sen. James J. Davis&#x27;s 60%. Butler voted for Norman Thomas of the Socialist Party for president in 1936.

===Bonus Army===

During his Senate campaign, Butler spoke out forcefully about the veterans&#x27; bonus. Veterans of World War I, many of whom had been out of work since the beginning of the Great Depression, sought immediate cash payment of Service Certificates granted to them eight years earlier via the World War Adjusted Compensation Act of 1924. Each Service Certificate, issued to a qualified veteran soldier, bore a face value equal to the soldier&#x27;s promised payment, plus compound interest. The problem was that the certificates (like bonds), matured 20 years from the date of original issuance, thus, under extant law, the Service Certificates could not be redeemed until 1945. In June 1932, approximately 43,000 marchers, including 17,000 World War I veterans, their families, and affiliated groups, protested in Washington, D.C. The Bonus Expeditionary Force, also known as the &quot;Bonus Army&quot;, marched on Washington to advocate the passage of the &quot;soldier&#x27;s bonus&quot; for service during World War I. After Congress adjourned, bonus marchers remained in the city and became unruly. On July 28, 1932, two bonus marchers were shot by police, causing the entire mob to become hostile and riotous. The FBI, then known as the United States Bureau of Investigation, checked its fingerprint records to obtain the police records of individuals who had been arrested during the riots or who had participated in the bonus march.

The veterans made camp in the Anacostia flats while they awaited the congressional decision on whether or not to pay the bonus. The motion, known as the Patman bill, was decisively defeated, but the veterans stayed in their camp. On July 19, Butler arrived with his young son Thomas, the day before the official eviction by the Hoover administration. He walked through the camp and spoke to the veterans; he told them that they were fine soldiers and they had a right to lobby Congress just as much as any corporation. He and his son spent the night and ate with the men, and in the morning Butler gave a speech to the camping veterans. He instructed them to keep their sense of humor and cautioned them not to do anything that would cost public sympathy. On July 28, army cavalry units led by General Douglas MacArthur dispersed the Bonus Army by riding through it and using gas. During the conflict several veterans were killed or injured. Butler declared himself a &quot;Hoover-for-Ex-President-Republican&quot;.

===Anti-war lectures===
After his retirement and later years, Butler became widely known for his outspoken lectures against war profiteering, U.S. military adventurism, and what he viewed as nascent fascism in the United States.

In December 1933, Butler toured the country with James E. Van Zandt to recruit members for the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW). He described their effort as &quot;trying to educate the soldiers out of the sucker class.&quot; In his speeches he denounced the Economy Act of 1933, called on veterans to organize politically to win their benefits, and condemned the FDR administration for its ties to big business. The VFW reprinted one of his speeches with the title &quot;You Got to Get Mad&quot; in its magazine &quot;Foreign Service&quot;. He said: &quot;I believe in...taking Wall St. by the throat and shaking it up.&quot; He believed the rival veterans&#x27; group the American Legion was controlled by banking interests. On December 8, 1933, he said: &quot;I have never known one leader of the American Legion who had never sold them out—and I mean it.&quot;

In addition to his speeches to pacifist groups, he served from 1935 to 1937 as a spokesman for the American League Against War and Fascism. In 1935, he wrote the exposé &quot;War Is a Racket&quot;, a trenchant condemnation of the profit motive behind warfare. His views on the subject are summarized in the following passage from the November 1935 issue of the socialist magazine &quot;Common Sense&quot;:

===Business Plot===
In November 1934, Butler claimed the existence of a political conspiracy by business leaders to overthrow President Roosevelt, a series of allegations that came to be known in the media as the Business Plot. A special committee of the House of Representatives headed by Representatives John W. McCormack of Massachusetts and Samuel Dickstein of New York, who was later alleged to have been a paid agent of the NKVD, heard his testimony in secret. The McCormack–Dickstein committee was a precursor to the House Un-American Activities Committee.

In November 1934, Butler told the committee that one Gerald P. MacGuire told him that a group of businessmen, supposedly backed by a private army of 500,000 ex-soldiers and others, intended to establish a fascist dictatorship. Butler had been asked to lead it, he said, by MacGuire, who was a bond salesman with Grayson M. P. Murphy &amp; Co. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that Butler had told friends that General Hugh S. Johnson, former head of the National Recovery Administration, was to be installed as dictator, and that the J.P. Morgan banking firm was behind the plot. Butler told Congress that MacGuire had told him the attempted coup was backed by three million dollars, and that the 500,000 men were probably to be assembled in Washington, D.C. the following year. All the parties alleged to be involved publicly said there was no truth in the story, calling it a joke and a fantasy.

In its report to the House, the committee stated that, while &quot;no evidence was presented... to show a connection... with any fascist activity of any European country... [t]here was no question that these attempts were discussed, were planned, and might have been placed in execution...&quot; and that &quot;your committee was able to verify all the pertinent statements made by General Butler, with the exception of the direct statement about the creation of the organization. This, however, was corroborated in the correspondence of MacGuire with his principal, Robert Sterling Clark...&quot;

No prosecutions or further investigations followed, and historians have questioned whether or not a coup was actually contemplated. Historians have not reported any independent evidence apart from Butler&#x27;s report on what MacGuire told him. One of these, Hans Schmidt, says MacGuire was an &quot;inconsequential trickster&quot;. The news media dismissed the plot, with a &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial characterizing it as a &quot;gigantic hoax&quot;. When the committee&#x27;s final report was released, the &quot;Times&quot; said the committee &quot;purported to report that a two-month investigation had convinced it that General Butler&#x27;s story of a Fascist march on Washington was alarmingly true&quot; and &quot;... also alleged that definite proof had been found that the much publicized Fascist march on Washington, which was to have been led by Major Gen. Smedley D. Butler, retired, according to testimony at a hearing, was actually contemplated&quot;. The individuals involved all denied the existence of a plot.

=== Death ===

Upon his retirement, Butler bought a home in Newtown Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, where he lived with his wife. In June 1940, he checked himself into the hospital after becoming sick a few weeks earlier. His doctor described his illness as an incurable condition of the upper gastro-intestinal tract that was probably cancer. His family remained by his side, even bringing his new car so he could see it from the window. He never had a chance to drive it. On June 21, 1940, Smedley Butler died at Naval Hospital, Philadelphia.

The funeral was held at his home, attended by friends and family as well as several politicians, members of the Philadelphia police force, and officers of the Marine Corps. He was buried at Oaklands Cemetery in West Goshen Township, Pennsylvania. His modest gravestone is located in Section B-1 (see site map). After his death, his family maintained his home as it was when he died, including a large quantity of memorabilia he collected throughout his storied career, until 2014.

<text>Chang&#x27;e ( ; ), originally known as Heng&#x27;e (), is the goddess of the Moon and wife of Hou Yi, the great archer. Renowned for her beauty, Chang&#x27;e is also known for her ascending to the Moon with her pet Yu Tu, the Moon Rabbit and living in the Moon Palace (). She is one of the major goddesses in Chinese mythology, Chinese folk religion, Chinese Buddhism, Confucianism, and Taoism. In modern times, Chang&#x27;e is the namesake of the Chinese Lunar Exploration Program.

== Origins and descriptions ==
Chang&#x27;e first appeared in &quot;Guicang&quot;, a divination text written during the Zhou Dynasty (1046 BC – 256 BC). From the few preserved fragments of the text, it mentions &quot;Yi shoots the ten Suns&quot;, and &quot;Chang&#x27;e ascending to the moon.&quot; Chang&#x27;e—originally named Heng&#x27;e ()—was renamed to avoid the taboo on sharing names with a deceased emperor, in this case, Liu Heng, an emperor from Han Dynasty. Many Chinese poems are written around the theme of Chang&#x27;e and the moon.

In pre-Qin Dynasty (before 221 BC), the text, &quot;Classic of Mountains and Seas&quot; (), mentions &quot;a woman is bathing the moon; she is Chang Xi, the wife of Emperor Jun. She has given birth to twelve moons, and only then does she begin to bathe the moon&quot; (). The name &quot;Chang Xi&quot; in this text refers to &quot;Chang&#x27;e&quot; since the pronunciation of &quot;e ()&quot; is identical to &quot;xi ()&quot; in ancient Chinese.

Late Tang Dynasty (618–907), famous poet, Li Shangyin, wrote the poem &quot;Chang&#x27;e&quot; based on the story of Chang&#x27;e stealing the immortal elixir. Like this goddess, the poet discovers a connection in the solitude of moonlight, sensing their shared loneliness while gazing at the night sky. Among the hundreds of poems around Chang&#x27;e and the Moon, she gradually evolved into a symbol of nostalgia and solitude for numerous poets beyond Li.

The original poem in Traditional Chinese:

&lt;poem&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

The translation by Witter Bynner, in his book &quot;The Jade Mountain&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;To the Moon Goddess

Now that a candle-shadow stands on the screen of carven marble

And the River of Heaven slants and the morning stars are low,

Are you sorry for having stolen the potion that has set you

Over purple seas and blue skies, to brood through the long nights?&lt;/poem&gt;

During the Ming and Qing dynasties (Ming: 1368–1644, Qing: 1644–1911), with the flourishing of urban literature, the image of Chang&#x27;e gradually became more secularized. In the novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot; (, 1592), Chang&#x27;e is a title that refers to the celestial maidens in the Moon Palace, and it is the Weathervane Marshal who teases the Niche Dress Fairy, not Chang&#x27;e. In &quot;Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio&quot; (, 1766), while Chang&#x27;e remains a celestial being from heaven, her character undergoes a transformation as she descends to the mortal realm, shedding her divinity.

==Myth==
===Tales===


There are many tales about Chang&#x27;e, including a well-known story about her that is given as the origin of the Mid-Autumn Festival.

 in a very distant past, Chang&#x27;e was a beautiful woman. Ten suns had risen together into the skies and scorched the Earth, thus causing hardship for the people. Hou Yi, a legendary archer and the husband of Chang&#x27;e, shot down nine of them, leaving just one Sun, and was rewarded with two portions of the elixir of immortality. As he did not want to gain immortality without his beloved wife, Hou Yi waited to consume the elixir and left it with his wife, Chang&#x27;e. While Hou Yi went hunting, his apprentice Fengmeng broke into his house and tried to force Chang&#x27;e to give him the elixir, so Chang&#x27;e took both portions herself rather than giving them up to Fengmeng. Then, Chang&#x27;e flew upward past the heavens, choosing the Moon to be her immortal residence as she loved her husband and wished to live near him. When Hou Yi discovered what transpired, he felt responsible for Chang&#x27;e, so he displayed the fruits and cakes that his wife had enjoyed, then killed himself.

In older versions of the story, Chang&#x27;e stole the elixir from Hou Yi, drank it, and flew to the Moon so that her husband could not go after her.

In the most classic version of the story, Wu Gang does good deeds for the King, and receives an immortality pill from him, and is asked to keep it safe in his house. One day, when Wu Gang was not home, thieves broke in, and Chang&#x27;e, in a brief shock of pain, swallows it when she was not supposed to. Citizens cried as Chang&#x27;e flew up to the Moon, now living with a jade rabbit. Her husband returns, realizes what just happened and mourns her death. He continues to cut wood for Chang&#x27;e in the mortal realm. His name is changed to Hou Yi in some adaptations of the myth.

=== In other depictions ===

Chang&#x27;e also appears in Wu Cheng&#x27;en&#x27;s late 16th-century novel, the &quot;Journey to the West&quot;; here, she is said to live in the &quot;Guǎng Hán Gōng&quot; (), located upon the Moon. During a heavenly festival of immortal peaches (after Sun Wukong&#x27;s banishment), the heavenly official (a Canopy Marshal named &quot;Heavenly Tumbleweed&quot;) who would become &quot;Zhu Bajie&quot;, became heavily drunk, saw the goddess Chang&#x27;e, and attempted to force himself on her, only to be prevented and reported for this act. He was reincarnated as a boar/man beast-monster, who would later be recruited by the Bodhisattva, &quot;Guanyin&quot;, as a guardian for &quot;Tang Sanzang&quot; as he went on his pilgrimage to India for the &quot;Tripitaka&quot;, the three baskets of scriptures written by &quot;Tathāgata&quot; &quot;Buddha&quot;. Later into the story, the goddess Chang&#x27;e&#x27;s pet, the Jade Rabbit, became an antagonist and had to be retrieved by Chang&#x27;e and Taiyin Xingjun before &quot;Sun Wukong&quot; killed the rabbit.

=== Adaptations into film and novels ===
In 2020, a film called &quot;Over the Moon&quot; premiered on Netflix. A young girl named Fei Fei flies to the Moon using a rocket she built to find Chang&#x27;e. Her hope is to convince her father true love exists and persuade him not to remarry. Chang&#x27;e is mourning over the loss of Houyi, who died on earth before they could be reunited. She believes Fei Fei holds the key to reuniting her with Houyi (through a magical potion created by Jade Rabbit) before the last sliver of moonlight is gone.

==Space travel==
 Chang&#x27;e was mentioned in a conversation between Houston CAPCOM and the Apollo 11 crew just before the first Moon landing in 1969: The International Astronomical Union has assigned the name Chang-Ngo to a small impact crater on the Moon. 

In 2007, China launched its first lunar probe, a robotic spacecraft named Chang&#x27;e 1 in the Goddess&#x27; honor. A second robotic probe, named Chang&#x27;e 2, was launched in 2010. A third Chang&#x27;e spacecraft, called Chang&#x27;e 3, landed on the Moon on 14 December 2013, making China the third country to achieve such a feat after the former Soviet Union and the United States. The lander also delivered the robotic rover &quot;Yutu&quot; (&quot;Jade Rabbit&quot;) to the lunar surface. On 3 January 2019, Chang&#x27;e 4 touched down on the far side of the Moon and deployed the &quot;Yutu-2&quot; rover. Likewise all Chinese landers since then are named as Chang&#x27;e.

The original plotline and inspiration of Naoko Takeuchi&#x27;s &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; is inspired by the legend of Chang&#x27;e (and &quot;Nayotake-no-Kaguya-hime&quot; from &quot;The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter&quot; and the myth of Selene and her mortal-turned-immortal lover, Endymion from Classical Greco-Roman Mythology). The titular character is a princess of the Moon while her love interest is from Earth; her reincarnation&#x27;s civilian identity&#x27;s name is &quot;Usagi Tsukino&quot; (a pun on the &quot;Rabbit on the Moon&quot;).

In the video game series &quot;Touhou Project&quot;, Chang&#x27;e is the mysterious sworn enemy of Junko, the final boss of the 15th game &quot;Legacy of Lunatic Kingdom&quot;.

Chang&#x27;e and her story is the main theme of the 2020 American-Chinese animated feature film &quot;Over the Moon&quot; produced by Netflix. The goddess is voiced by Phillipa Soo.

Chang&#x27;e and her story was reimagined in the 2022 fantasy novel &quot;Daughter of the Moon Goddess&quot; by Sue Lynn Tan.

Australian psychedelic rock band King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard included the track &quot;Chang&#x27;e&quot;, containing elements of her story, on their 2023 album &quot;The Silver Cord&quot;. They reference her again in the song &quot;Mirage City&quot; on their 2024 album &quot;Flight b741&quot;.

<doc id="369976" wikidata="Q643750" url="?curid=369976" title="Wiluna, Western Australia">
<text>Wiluna is a small town in the Goldfields-Esperance region (since 2021) of Western Australia. It is situated on the edge of the Western Desert at the gateway to the Canning Stock Route and Gunbarrel Highway. It is the service centre of the local area for the local Martu people, the pastoral industry, the Wiluna Gold Mine, and many more people who work on other mines in the area on a &quot;fly-in/fly-out&quot; basis. 

Wiluna&#x27;s climate is hot and dry, with an annual rainfall of . Mean maximum temperatures range from in July, to in January.

The closest service centre is in Meekatharra.

== Overview ==
Wiluna has from 200 to 600 Aboriginal people living within its community, depending upon the nature, time and place of the traditional law ceremonies across the Central Desert region. The traditional Aboriginal owners (a grouping known as the Martu) were &quot;settled&quot; as a consequence of the British colonisation process that began in the 1800s. In the 1950s a church-based group were supported by the government of the day to establish a mission. The traditional people lost their lands through many different processes, including the issuing of pastoral leases, the discovery of gold and the influx of non-Aboriginal people onto their lands.

Before and after the atomic nuclear testing near Maralinga in South Australia in the 1950s, many Aboriginal people from at least three different tribal and language groups were forced to live within the mission site. This created many conflicts and the legacy continues today. Much traditional knowledge and skill exists today amongst the Aboriginal residents and visitors.

The existence of an historical Club Hotel, a dilapidated relic of the town&#x27;s former heyday, created much conflict with many people opposed to its presence as an operating pub arising from the conflict and trauma associated with alcohol abuse. 

In 2019, a major renovation converted the Club Hotel into the Shire of Wiluna administration buildings. 

The town also has a general store, petrol, caravan park, sports oval, public swimming pool, school, and health clinic.

Local water holes are much damaged and overused after years of cattle use.

During the wet season, large lakes may form that attract an array of wildlife. The region has snakes, kangaroos, bungarras (large lizard/goanna), bush turkeys, donkeys, horses, camels and dingoes.

Willuna is home to VMW, a marine weather transmitter operated by the Bureau of Meteorology.

Parts of the unsealed and flood-prone road between Wiluna and Meekatharra are being sealed, as part of a pilot program in which the Government of Western Australia provided for road work contractors in collaboration with the Martu-ku Yiwarra Training Centre.

===Mines===
The Wiluna area was explored by Lawrence Wells in 1892. Gold was discovered in the area in 1896, and within a few months over 300 prospectors were in the area. The town of Wiluna was gazetted in 1898, the name &quot;Wiluna&quot; being the Wati (Aboriginal language) name for the area. By the 1930s, the town had a population of over 9,000 people, but World War II severely affected the gold mining industry, and many mines were shut down. By 1963 the population had fallen to less than 100. Gold mining resumed in the area in 1981.

The closest mine site to town is the Wiluna Gold Mine, approximately south of Wiluna. The mine is operated by Wiluna Mining Corporation and currently produces gold from re-processing of legacy mine tailings.

Yeleeri site, located south has uranium ore, and the region boasts much mineral wealth.

The Paroo Station lead carbonate open pit mine is located west of Wiluna. As of January 2015 it was being placed into care and maintenance due to low global prices for lead.

Wiluna and the Mid-West region are the site of Western Australia&#x27;s most advanced uranium mining projects. Three projects are in the approval process, with the Lake Maitland uranium project and the Lake Way uranium project both owned by Toro Energy Ltd, and the Yeelirrie uranium project which BHP Billiton sold to Cameco. All three are located within of Wiluna. All three projects were opposed by environmental groups and some local people. Yeelirrie is most fiercely opposed, with over 40 years of clear opposition from traditional owners.

===Meteors===
In October 1960, two station workers named Fred Vincenti and Frank Quadrio were opening a fence gate on the Millbillillie-Jundee track from Wiluna when they witnessed a bright fireball falling into spinifex (&quot;Triodia&quot;) grassland to the north. The debris from this meteor became known as the Millbillillie meteorite and is understood to be pieces of the asteroid Vesta that had at some point been knocked off by a collision in the asteroid belt. Although no official specimens were recovered until 1970 it is understood that members of the local Aboriginal community had collected pieces.

Another meteorite fall was recorded near Wiluna on 2 September 1967. This meteorite was a H5-class object; specimens were collected and housed in the Western Australian Museum.

== Education ==
Wiluna Remote Community School is a school that provides education for students from year 1–12, currently having a student population of between 85 and 115 students.

The school provides a bus as transport to and from the school for the students. The indigenous language of the area is Martu Wangka dialect, however most students speak Aboriginal English.

==Origin of name==
An early mining settlement of Lake Way Gold, named after the dry Lake Way south of Wiluna, established around 1896, was called &quot;Weeloona&quot;, derived from an Aboriginal word meaning &quot;Place of wind&quot; or &quot;Windy place&quot;. However, the name is also sometimes claimed to come from the cry of the curlew, which is frequent in the area.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Wiluna experiences a desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;), though like most of inland Western Australia it has seen its rainfall increase by around 40 percent since 1967. The heaviest rainfall, however, was associated with the April 1900 floods when the town received , two-and-half-times its normal annual rainfall.

== Railways ==
Wiluna was the furthest away from Perth that the narrow gauge Western Australian Government Railways system reached. The Wiluna branch was connected to the main Northern Railway at Meekatharra. The branch opened to Wiluna on 2 November 1932. The line was closed on 5 August 1957.

== People from Wiluna ==
The Indigenous people who have always lived in the region come from different tribal groups. Accomplished hunters, crafts people, pastoralists, bush mechanics and people with many other skills exist today within the community.

The former Governor-General of Australia, Major General Michael Jeffery was born in Wiluna on 12 December 1937. A new primary school was constructed in Wiluna after Jeffery visited the town in 2006 and criticised the condition of the existing school.

Warri and Yatungka were a famous Aboriginal couple who died in Wiluna in 1979. They were the last of the Mandildjara people to leave their country and the hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Their Romeo and Juliet-like story was recorded in the best-selling book &quot;The Last of the Nomads&quot; by Dr W J Peasley. This story is recounted as Peasley, organising the expedition, although it was Stan Gratte of Geraldton (OAM) who organised this party to recover them when urged by Warri&#x27;s brother Moodjeren, who was concerned, due to old age and the lack of young people who would normally assist the elderly, they would not survive the extended drought which was now gripping Central Australia. Emaciated and likely close to death, the couple were brought to Wiluna where they were forgiven by their people for breaking the Mandildjara marriage laws decades before. They died in 1979 within four weeks of each other.

<text>A nian beast () is a beast in Chinese mythology. According to Chinese mythology, the &quot;nian&quot; lives under the sea or in the mountains. The Chinese character &quot;nian&quot; more usually means &quot;year&quot; or &quot;new year&quot;. The earliest written sources that refer to the &quot;nian&quot; as a creature date to the early 20th century. As a result, it is unclear whether the &quot;nian&quot; creature is an authentic part of traditional folk mythology, or a part of a local oral tradition that was recorded in the early 20th century. &quot;Nian&quot; is one of the key characters in the Chinese New Year. Scholars cite it as the reason behind several practices during the celebration, such as wearing red clothing and creating noise from drums and fireworks.

==Modern legends==
Once every year at the beginning of Chinese New Year, the &quot;nian&quot; would come out of its hiding place to feed, mostly on people and animals. During the winter, when food was scarce, it would raid villages, eating the crops and sometimes the villagers themselves - particularly their children. Several accounts describe its appearance, with some claiming that it resembles a flat-faced lion with the body of a dog and prominent incisors. Other authors described it as larger than an elephant with two long horns and many sharp teeth. The weaknesses of the &quot;nian&quot; are purported to be a sensitivity to loud noises, fire, and a fear of the color red.

Some local legends attribute the Chinese lion dance () to the &quot;nian&quot;. The tradition has its origins in a story of a &quot;nian&#x27;s&quot; attack on a village. After the attack, the villagers discussed how to make the &quot;nian&quot; leave them in peace. Since it was discovered that the beast was afraid of the color red, people put red lanterns and spring scrolls on their windows and doors. They would also leave food at their doorstep in a bid to divert it from eating humans. Other sources say that an old man who came to visit actually informed the villagers of the &quot;nian&quot;&#x27;s weaknesses.

The traditions of firecrackers, red lanterns, and red robes found in many lion dance portrayals originate from the villagers&#x27; practice of hitting drums, plates, and empty bowls, wearing red robes, and throwing firecrackers, causing loud banging sounds to intimidate the &quot;nian&quot;. According to this same myth, it was captured by Hongjun Laozu, an ancient Taoist monk, and became his mount.

==Ancient sources==
Various aspects of cultural practices relating to Chinese New Year are part of the &quot;nian&quot; legend. These cultural practices are recorded in ancient texts, though none of them refer to a creature called &quot;nian&quot;.

The &quot;Erya&quot; records that the character &quot;nian&quot; () was first used to mean &quot;year&quot; during the Zhou dynasty, replacing terms used in previous eras. The &quot;Shuowen Jiezi&quot; records that the character &quot;nian&quot; meant &quot;ripeness of grains&quot; and was composed of the character &quot;&quot;he&quot; (, rice plant) and &quot;qian&quot;&quot; (, indicating the sound) and quotes the &quot;Chunqiu,&quot; which uses it in the sense of a great harvest.

The attributes of the &quot;nian&quot; creature in the modern legend, of fear of noise and fire, correlate with ancient legends relating to the use of firecrackers to drive off ape-like creatures in the mountains called &quot;shanxiao&quot; (), first recorded in the &quot;Shanhaijing&quot;.

The practice of sweeping and cleaning at the start of the year is recorded in Zhou dynasty sources as intended to ward off plague spirits, and the practice of using music and drama to receive gods and ward off plague spirits is recorded from the same era. The creature&#x27;s role in the celebration of the Chinese New Year is highlighted by the way the Chinese call this holiday &quot;Guo Nian&quot;, which means &quot;pass over &quot;nian&quot;&quot; or &quot;overcome &quot;nian&quot;.&quot;

<doc id="369978" wikidata="Q1126556" url="?curid=369978" title="Bird vocalization">
<text>Bird vocalization includes both bird calls and bird songs. In non-technical use, bird songs (often simply &quot;birdsong&quot;) are the bird sounds that are melodious to the human ear. In ornithology and birding, songs (relatively complex vocalizations) are distinguished by function from calls (relatively simple vocalizations).

==Definition==
The distinction between songs and calls is based upon complexity, length, and context. Songs are longer and more complex and are associated with territory and courtship and mating, while calls tend to serve such functions as alarms or keeping members of a flock in contact. Other authorities such as Howell and Webb (1995) make the distinction based on function, so that short vocalizations, such as those of pigeons, and even non-vocal sounds, such as the drumming of woodpeckers and the &quot;winnowing&quot; of snipes&#x27; wings in display flight, are considered songs. Still others require song to have syllabic diversity and temporal regularity akin to the repetitive and transformative patterns that define music. It is generally agreed upon in birding and ornithology which sounds are songs and which are calls, and a good field guide will differentiate between the two.
Bird song is best developed in the order Passeriformes. Some groups are nearly voiceless, producing only percussive and rhythmic sounds, such as the storks, which clatter their bills. In some manakins (Pipridae), the males have evolved several mechanisms for mechanical sound production, including mechanisms for stridulation not unlike those found in some insects. The production of sounds by mechanical means as opposed to the use of the syrinx has been termed variously &quot;instrumental music&quot; by Charles Darwin, &quot;mechanical sounds&quot; and more recently &quot;sonation&quot;. The term &quot;sonate&quot; has been defined as the act of producing non-vocal sounds that are intentionally modulated communicative signals, produced using non-syringeal structures such as the bill, wings, tail, feet and body feathers.

Song is usually delivered from prominent perches, although some species may sing when flying. 

In extratropical Eurasia and the Americas almost all song is produced by male birds; however, in the tropics and to a greater extent the desert belts of Australia and Africa it is more typical for females to sing as much as males. These differences have been known for a long time and are generally attributed to the much less regular and seasonal climate of Australian and African arid zones requiring that birds breed at any time when conditions are favourable, although they cannot breed in many years because food supply never increases above a minimal level. With aseasonal irregular breeding, both sexes must be brought into breeding condition and vocalisation, especially duetting, serves this purpose. The high frequency of female vocalisations in the tropics, Australia and Southern Africa may also relate to very low mortality rates producing much stronger pair-bonding and territoriality.

==Anatomy and physiology==

The avian vocal organ is called the syrinx; it is a bony structure at the bottom of the trachea (unlike the larynx at the top of the mammalian trachea). The syrinx and sometimes a surrounding air sac resonate to sound waves that are made by membranes past which the bird forces air. The bird controls the pitch by changing the tension on the membranes and controls both pitch and volume by changing the force of exhalation. It can control the two sides of the trachea independently, which is how some species can produce two notes at once.

In February 2023, scientists reported that the possible sounds that ankylosaur dinosaurs may have made were bird-like vocalizations based on a finding of a fossilized larynx from the ankylosaur &quot;Pinacosaurus grangeri&quot;.

==Function==
One of the two main functions of bird song is mate attraction. Scientists hypothesize that bird song evolved through sexual selection, and experiments suggest that the quality of bird song may be a good indicator of fitness. Experiments also suggest that parasites and diseases may directly affect song characteristics such as song rate, which thereby act as reliable indicators of health. The song repertoire also appears to indicate fitness in some species. The ability of male birds to hold and advertise territories using song also demonstrates their fitness. Therefore, a female bird may select males based on the quality of their songs and the size of their song repertoire.

The second principal function of bird song is territory defense. Territorial birds will interact with each other using song to negotiate territory boundaries. Since song may be a reliable indicator of quality, individuals may be able to discern the quality of rivals and prevent an energetically costly fight. In birds with song repertoires, individuals may share the same song type and use these song types for more complex communication. Some birds will respond to a shared song type with a song-type match (i.e. with the same song type). This may be an aggressive signal; however, results are mixed. Birds may also interact using repertoire-matches, wherein a bird responds with a song type that is in its rival&#x27;s repertoire but is not the song that it is currently singing. This may be a less aggressive act than song-type matching. Song complexity is also linked to male territorial defense, with more complex songs being perceived as a greater territorial threat.

Birds communicate alarm through vocalizations and movements that are specific to the threat, and bird alarms can be understood by other animal species, including other birds, in order to identify and protect against the specific threat. Mobbing calls are used to recruit individuals in an area where an owl or other predator may be present. These calls are characterized by wide frequency spectra, sharp onset and termination, and repetitiveness that are common across species and are believed to be helpful to other potential &quot;mobbers&quot; by being easy to locate. The alarm calls of most species, on the other hand, are characteristically high-pitched, making the caller difficult to locate.
Communication through bird calls can be between individuals of the same species or even across species. For example, the Japanese tit will respond to the recruitment call of the willow tit as long as it follows the Japanese tit alert call in the correct alert+recruitment order.

Individual birds may be sensitive enough to identify each other through their calls. Many birds that nest in colonies can locate their chicks using their calls. Calls are sometimes distinctive enough for individual identification even by human researchers in ecological studies.
Over 400 bird species engage in duet calls. In some cases, the duets are so perfectly timed as to appear almost as one call. This kind of calling is termed antiphonal duetting. Such duetting is noted in a wide range of families including quails, bushshrikes, babblers such as the scimitar babblers, and some owls and parrots. In territorial songbirds, birds are more likely to when they have been aroused by simulated intrusion into their territory. This implies a role in intraspecies aggressive competition towards joint resource defense. Duets are well known in cranes, but the Sarus Crane seems unique in infrequently also having three bonded adults defending one territory who perform &quot;triets&quot;. Triets had a lower frequency relative to duets, but the functional value of this difference is not yet known.

Sometimes, songs vocalized in the post-breeding season act as a cue to conspecific eavesdroppers. In black-throated blue warblers, males that have bred and reproduced successfully sing to their offspring to influence their vocal development, while males that have failed to reproduce usually abandon the nests and stay silent. The post-breeding song therefore inadvertently informs the unsuccessful males of particular habitats that have a higher likelihood of reproductive success. The social communication by vocalization provides a shortcut to locating high quality habitats and saves the trouble of directly assessing various vegetation structures.
Some birds are excellent vocal mimics. In some tropical species, mimics such as the drongos may have a role in the formation of mixed-species foraging flocks. Vocal mimicry can include conspecifics, other species or even man-made sounds. Many hypotheses have been made on the functions of vocal mimicry including suggestions that they may be involved in sexual selection by acting as an indicator of fitness, help brood parasites, or protect against predation, but strong support is lacking for any function. Many birds, especially those that nest in cavities, are known to produce a snakelike hissing sound that may help deter predators at close range.

Some cave-dwelling species, including the oilbird and swiftlets (&quot;Collocalia&quot; and &quot;Aerodramus&quot; species), use audible sound (with the majority of sonic location occurring between 2 and 5 kHz) to echolocate in the darkness of caves. The only bird known to make use of infrasound (at about 20 Hz) is the western capercaillie.

The hearing range of birds is from below 50 Hz (infrasound) to around 12 kHz, with maximum sensitivity between 1 and 5 kHz. The black jacobin is exceptional in producing sounds at about 11.8 kHz. It is not known if they can hear these sounds.

The range of frequencies at which birds call in an environment varies with the quality of habitat and the ambient sounds. The acoustic adaptation hypothesis predicts that narrow bandwidths, low frequencies, and long elements and inter-element intervals should be found in habitats with complex vegetation structures (which would absorb and muffle sounds), while high frequencies, broad bandwidth, high-frequency modulations (trills), and short elements and inter-elements may be expected in open habitats, without obstructive vegetation.

Low frequency songs are optimal for obstructed, densely vegetated habitats because low frequency, slowly modulated song elements are less susceptible to signal degradation by means of reverberations off of sound-reflecting vegetation. High frequency calls with rapid modulations are optimal for open habitats because they degrade less across open space. The acoustic adaptation hypothesis also states that song characteristics may take advantage of beneficial acoustic properties of the environment. Narrow-frequency bandwidth notes are increased in volume and length by reverberations in densely vegetated habitats.

It has been hypothesized that the available frequency range is partitioned, and birds call so that overlap between different species in frequency and time is reduced. This idea has been termed the &quot;acoustic niche&quot;. Birds sing louder and at a higher pitch in urban areas, where there is ambient low-frequency noise. Traffic noise was found to decrease reproductive success in the great tit (&quot;Parus major&quot;) due to the overlap in acoustic frequency. During the COVID-19 pandemic, reduced traffic noise led to birds in San Francisco singing 30% more softly. An increase in song volume restored fitness to birds in urban areas, as did higher frequency songs.

It has been proposed that birds show latitudinal variation in song complexity; however, there is no strong evidence that song complexity increases with latitude or migratory behaviour.

According to a study published in 2019, the white bellbird makes the loudest call ever recorded for birds, reaching 125 dB. The record was previously held by the screaming piha with 116 dB.

A 2023 study found a correlation between the dawn chorus of male birds and the absence of females. The research was conducted in southern Germany, with male blue tits being the birds of interest. Researchers &quot;found that the males sang at high rates while their female partners were still roosting in the nest box at dawn, and stopped singing as soon as the females left the nest box to join them&quot;. The males were also more likely to sing when the females entered the nests in the evening or even during the daytime. While this information is eye-opening, it still does not answer the question of &quot;why&quot; male birds sing more when females are absent.

==Neuroanatomy==
The acquisition and learning of bird song involves a group of distinct brain areas that are aligned in two connecting pathways:

* Anterior forebrain pathway (vocal learning): composed of Area X, which is a homologue to mammalian basal ganglia; the lateral part of the magnocellular nucleus of anterior nidopallium (LMAN), also considered a part of the avian basal ganglia; and the dorso-lateral division of the medial thalamus (DLM).
* Posterior descending pathway (vocal production): composed of HVC (proper name, although sometimes referred to as the high vocal center); the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA); and the tracheosyringeal part of the hypoglossal nucleus (nXIIts).

The posterior descending pathway (PDP) is required throughout a bird&#x27;s life for normal song production, while the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP) is necessary for song learning, plasticity, and maintenance, but not for adult song production.

Both neural pathways in the song system begin at the level of HVC, which projects information both to the RA (premotor nucleus) and to Area X of the anterior forebrain. Information in the posterior descending pathway (also referred to as the vocal production or motor pathway) descends from HVC to RA, and then from RA to the tracheosyringeal part of the hypoglossal nerve (nXIIts), which then controls muscular contractions of the syrinx.

Information in the anterior forebrain pathway is projected from HVC to Area X (basal ganglia), then from Area X to the DLM (thalamus), and from DLM to LMAN, which then links the vocal learning and vocal production pathways through connections back to the RA. Some investigators have posited a model in which the connection between LMAN and RA carries an instructive signal based on evaluation of auditory feedback (comparing the bird&#x27;s own song to the memorized song template), which adaptively alters the motor program for song output. The generation of this instructive signal could be facilitated by auditory neurons in Area X and LMAN that show selectivity for the temporal qualities of the bird&#x27;s own song (BOS) and its tutor song, providing a platform for comparing the BOS and the memorized tutor song.

Models regarding the real-time error-correction interactions between the AFP and PDP will be considered in the future. Other current research has begun to explore the cellular mechanisms underlying HVC control of temporal patterns of song structure and RA control of syllable production.
Brain structures involved in both pathways show sexual dimorphism in many bird species, usually causing males and females to sing differently. Some of the known types of dimorphisms in the brain include the size of nuclei, the number of neurons present, and the number of neurons connecting one nucleus to another.

In the extremely dimorphic zebra finches (&quot;Taeniopygia guttata&quot;), a species in which only males typically sing, the size of the HVC and RA are approximately three to six times larger in males than in females, and Area X does not appear to be recognizable in females. Research suggests that exposure to sex steroids during early development is partially responsible for these differences in the brain. Female zebra finches treated with estradiol after hatching followed by testosterone or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment in adulthood will develop an RA and HVC similar in size to males and will also display male-like singing behavior.

Hormone treatment alone does not seem to produce female finches with brain structures or behavior exactly like males. Furthermore, other research has shown results that contradict what would be expected based on our current knowledge of mammalian sexual differentiation. For example, male zebra finches castrated or given sex steroid inhibitors as hatchlings still develop normal masculine singing behavior. This suggests that other factors, such as the activation of genes on the z chromosome, might also play a role in normal male song development.

Hormones also have activational effects on singing and the song nuclei in adult birds. In canaries (&quot;Serinus canaria&quot;), females normally sing less often and with less complexity than males. However, when adult females are given androgen injections, their singing will increase to an almost male-like frequency. Furthermore, adult females injected with androgens also show an increased size in the HVC and RA regions. Melatonin is another hormone that is also believed to influence song behavior in adults, as many songbirds show melatonin receptors in neurons of the song nuclei.

Both the European starling (&quot;Sturnus vulgaris&quot;) and house sparrow (&quot;Passer domesticus&quot;) have demonstrated changes in song nuclei correlated with differing exposures to darkness and secretions of melatonin. This suggests that melatonin might play a role in the seasonal changes of singing behavior in songbirds that live in areas where the amount of daylight varies significantly throughout the year. Several other studies have looked at seasonal changes in the morphology of brain structures within the song system and have found that these changes (adult neurogenesis, gene expression) are dictated by photoperiod, hormonal changes and behavior.

The gene FOXP2, defects of which affect both speech production and comprehension of language in humans, becomes highly expressed in Area X during periods of vocal plasticity in both juvenile zebra finches and adult canaries.

==Learning==

The songs of different species of birds vary and are generally typical of the species. Species vary greatly in the complexity of their songs and in the number of distinct kinds of song they sing (up to 3000 in the brown thrasher); individuals within some species vary in the same way. In a few species, such as lyrebirds and mockingbirds, songs imbed arbitrary elements learned in the individual&#x27;s lifetime, a form of mimicry (though maybe better called &quot;appropriation&quot; (Ehrlich et al.), as the bird does not pass for another species). As early as 1773, it was established that birds learned calls, and cross-fostering experiments succeeded in making linnet &quot;Acanthis cannabina&quot; learn the song of a skylark, &quot;Alauda arvensis&quot;. In many species, it appears that although the basic song is the same for all members of the species, young birds learn some details of their songs from their fathers, and these variations build up over generations to form dialects.

Song learning in juvenile birds occurs in two stages: sensory learning, which involves the juvenile listening to the father or other conspecific bird and memorizing the spectral and temporal qualities of the song (song template), and sensorimotor learning, which involves the juvenile bird producing its own vocalizations and practicing its song until it accurately matches the memorized song template.

During the sensorimotor learning phase, song production begins with highly variable sub-vocalizations called &quot;sub-song&quot;, which is akin to babbling in human infants. Soon after, the juvenile song shows certain recognizable characteristics of the imitated adult song, but still lacks the stereotypy of the crystallized song – this is called &quot;plastic song&quot;.

After two or three months of song learning and rehearsal (depending on species), the juvenile produces a crystallized song, characterized by spectral and temporal stereotypy (very low variability in syllable production and syllable order). Some birds, such as zebra finches, which are the most popular species for birdsong research, have overlapping sensory and sensorimotor learning stages.

Research has indicated that birds&#x27; acquisition of song is a form of motor learning that involves regions of the basal ganglia. Further, the PDP (see &quot;Neuroanatomy&quot; below) has been considered homologous to a mammalian motor pathway originating in the cerebral cortex and descending through the brain stem, while the AFP has been considered homologous to the mammalian cortical pathway through the basal ganglia and thalamus. Models of bird-song motor learning can be useful in developing models for how humans learn speech.

In some species such as zebra finches, learning of song is limited to the first year; they are termed &quot;age-limited&quot; or &quot;close-ended&quot; learners. Other species such as the canaries can develop new songs even as sexually mature adults; these are termed &quot;open-ended&quot; learners.

Researchers have hypothesized that learned songs allow the development of more complex songs through cultural interaction, thus allowing intraspecies dialects that help birds to identify kin and to adapt their songs to different acoustic environments.

=== Auditory feedback in birdsong learning ===
Early experiments by Thorpe in 1954 showed the importance of a bird being able to hear a tutor&#x27;s song. When birds are raised in isolation, away from the influence of conspecific males, they still sing. While the song they produce, called &quot;isolate song&quot;, resembles the song of a wild bird, it shows distinctly different characteristics from the wild song and lacks its complexity. The importance of the bird being able to hear itself sing in the sensorimotor period was later discovered by Konishi. Birds deafened before the song-crystallization period went on to produce songs that were distinctly different from the wild type and isolate song. Since the emergence of these findings, investigators have been searching for the neural pathways that facilitate sensory/sensorimotor learning and mediating the matching of the bird&#x27;s own song with the memorized song template.

Several studies in the 1990s have looked at the neural mechanisms underlying birdsong learning by performing lesions to relevant brain structures involved in the production or maintenance of song or by deafening birds before and/or after song crystallization. Another experimental approach was recording the bird&#x27;s song and then playing it back while the bird is singing, causing perturbed auditory feedback (the bird hears the superposition of its own song and a fragmented portion of a previous song syllable). After Nordeen &amp; Nordeen made a landmark discovery as they demonstrated that auditory feedback was necessary for the maintenance of song in adult birds with crystallized song, Leonardo &amp; Konishi (1999) designed an auditory feedback perturbation protocol in order to explore the role of auditory feedback in adult song maintenance further, to investigate how adult songs deteriorate after extended exposure to perturbed auditory feedback, and to examine the degree to which adult birds could recover crystallized song over time after being removed from perturbed feedback exposure. This study offered further support for role of auditory feedback in maintaining adult song stability and demonstrated how adult maintenance of crystallized birdsong is dynamic rather than static.

Brainard &amp; Doupe (2000) posit a model in which LMAN (of the anterior forebrain) plays a primary role in error correction, as it detects differences between the song produced by the bird and its memorized song template and then sends an instructive error signal to structures in the vocal production pathway in order to correct or modify the motor program for song production. In their study, Brainard &amp; Doupe (2000) showed that while deafening adult birds led to the loss of song stereotypy due to altered auditory feedback and non-adaptive modification of the motor program, lesioning LMAN in the anterior forebrain pathway of adult birds that had been deafened led to the stabilization of song (LMAN lesions in deafened birds prevented any further deterioration in syllable production and song structure).

Currently, there are two competing models that elucidate the role of LMAN in generating an instructive error signal and projecting it to the motor production pathway:

&quot;Bird&#x27;s own song (BOS)-tuned error correction model&quot;

: During singing, the activation of LMAN neurons will depend on the match between auditory feedback from the song produced by the bird and the stored song template. If this is true, then the firing rates of LMAN neurons will be sensitive to changes in auditory feedback.

&quot;Efference copy model of error correction&quot;

: An efference copy of the motor command for song production is the basis of the real-time error-correction signal. During singing, activation of LMAN neurons will depend on the motor signal used to generate the song, and the learned prediction of expected auditory feedback based on that motor command. Error correction would occur more rapidly in this model.

Leonardo tested these models directly by recording spike rates in single LMAN neurons of adult zebra finches during singing in conditions with normal and perturbed auditory feedback. His results did not support the BOS-tuned error correction model, as the firing rates of LMAN neurons were unaffected by changes in auditory feedback and therefore, the error signal generated by LMAN appeared unrelated to auditory feedback. Moreover, the results from this study supported the predictions of the efference copy model, in which LMAN neurons are activated during singing by the efference copy of the motor signal (and its predictions of expected auditory feedback), allowing the neurons to be more precisely time-locked to changes in auditory feedback.

==== Mirror neurons and vocal learning ====
A mirror neuron is a neuron that discharges both when an individual performs an action and when he/she perceives that same action being performed by another. These neurons were first discovered in macaque monkeys, but recent research suggests that mirror neuron systems may be present in other animals including humans.

Mirror neurons have the following characteristics:
* They are located in the premotor cortex.
* They exhibit both sensory and motor properties.
* They are action-specific – mirror neurons are only active when an individual is performing or observing a certain type of action (e.g., grasping an object).

Because mirror neurons exhibit both sensory and motor activity, some researchers have suggested that mirror neurons may serve to map sensory experience onto motor structures. This has implications for birdsong learning– many birds rely on auditory feedback to acquire and maintain their songs. Mirror neurons may be mediating this comparison of what the bird hears, how it compares to a memorized song template, and what he produces.

In search of these auditory-motor neurons, Jonathan Prather and other researchers at Duke University recorded the activity of single neurons in the HVCs of swamp sparrows. They discovered that the neurons that project from the HVC to Area X (HVCX neurons) are highly responsive when the bird is hearing a playback of his own song. These neurons also fire in similar patterns when the bird is singing that same song. Swamp sparrows employ 3–5 different song types, and the neural activity differs depending on which song is heard or sung. The HVCX neurons only fire in response to the presentation (or singing) of one of the songs, the primary song type. They are also temporally selective, firing at a precise phase in the song syllable.

Prather, et al. found that during the short period of time before and after the bird sings, his HVCX neurons become insensitive to auditory input. In other words, the bird becomes &quot;deaf&quot; to his own song. This suggests that these neurons are producing a corollary discharge, which would allow for direct comparison of motor output and auditory input. This may be the mechanism underlying learning via auditory feedback. These findings are also in line with Leonardo&#x27;s (2004) efference copy model of error correction in birdsong learning and production.

Overall, the HVCX auditory motor neurons in swamp sparrows are very similar to the visual motor mirror neurons discovered in primates. Like mirror neurons, the HVCX neurons:

* Are located in a premotor brain area
* Exhibit both sensory and motor properties
* Are action-specific – a response is only triggered by the &quot;primary song type&quot;

The function of the mirror neuron system is still unclear. Some scientists speculate that mirror neurons may play a role in understanding the actions of others, imitation, theory of mind and language acquisition, though there is currently insufficient neurophysiological evidence in support of these theories. Specifically regarding birds, it is possible that the mirror neuron system serves as a general mechanism underlying vocal learning, but further research is needed. In addition to the implications for song learning, the mirror neuron system could also play a role in territorial behaviors such as song-type matching and countersinging.

=== Learning through cultural transmission ===
Culture in animals is usually defined to consist of socially transmitted behavior patterns (&quot;traditions&quot;) that are characteristic of certain populations. The learned nature of bird song as well as evidence of &quot;dialect&quot;-like local variations have support theories about the existence of avian culture.

As mentioned above, bird song&#x27;s dependence on learning was studied by Thorpe, who found that chaffinches raised in isolation from their first week of life produce highly abnormal and less complex songs compared to other chaffinches. This suggested that many aspects of song development in songbirds depends on tutoring by older members of the same species. Later studies observed canary-like elements in the song of a chaffinch raised by canaries, evidencing the strong role of tutors in the learning of song by juvenile birds.

Similar chaffinch song types (categorized based on their distinct elements and their order) were observed to cluster in similar geographic areas, and this discovery led to hypotheses about &quot;dialects&quot; in birdsong. It has since been postulated that these song type variations are not dialects like those we found in human language. This is because not all members of a given geographic area will conform to the same song type, and also because there is no singular characteristic of a song type that differentiates it from all other types (unlike human dialects where certain words are unique to certain dialects).

Based on this evidence of learning and localized song types, researchers began to investigate the social learning of birdsong as a form of cultural transmission. The behavior patterns constituting this culture are the songs themselves, and the song types can be considered as traditions.

==== Dopamine circuits and cultural transmission ====
A recent study has shown that a dopamine circuit in zebra finches may promote social learning of bird song from tutors. Their data shows that certain brain areas in juvenile zebra finches are excited by the singing of conspecific (i.e. same-species) tutors and not by loudspeakers playing zebra finch song. Additionally, they show that dopamine released into the HVC aids in the encoding of song.

=== Evolutionary preservation of bird vocal learning ===

==== The cultural trap hypothesis ====
Although a significant amount of research was done on bird song during the 20th century, none was able to elucidate the evolutionary &quot;use&quot; behind birdsong, especially with regards to large vocal repertoires. In response, Lachlan and Slater proposed a &quot;cultural trap&quot; model to explain persistence of wide varieties of song. This model is based on a concept of &quot;filters&quot;, in which:

* a male songbird&#x27;s (i.e. singer&#x27;s) filter contains the range of songs that it can develop
* a female songbird&#x27;s (i.e. receiver&#x27;s) filter contains the range of songs that it finds acceptable for mate choice

In one possible situation, the population consists mainly of birds with wide filters. In this population, a male songbird with a wide filter will rarely be chosen by the few females with narrow filters (as the male&#x27;s song is unlikely to fall within a narrower filter). Such females will have a relatively small choice of males to mate with, so the genetic basis of the females&#x27; narrow filter does not persist. Another possible situation deals with a population with mostly narrow filters. In the latter population, wide-filter males can feasibly avoid mate choice rejection by learning from older, narrow-filter males. Therefore, the average reproductive success of wide-filter birds is enhanced by the possibility of learning, and vocal learning and large song repertoires (i.e. wide filters) go hand-in-hand.

The cultural trap hypothesis is one example of gene-culture coevolution, in which selective pressures emerge from the interaction between genotypes and their cultural consequences.

==== Possible correlation with cognitive ability ====
Various studies have shown that adult birds that underwent stress during critical developmental periods produce less complex songs and have smaller HVC brain regions. This has led some researchers to hypothesize that sexual selection for more complex songs indirectly selects for stronger cognitive ability in males. Further investigation showed that male song sparrows with larger vocal repertoires required less time to solve detour-reaching cognitive tasks. Some have proposed that bird song (among other sexually selected traits such as flashy coloring, body symmetry, and elaborate courtship) allow female songbirds to quickly assess the cognitive skills and development of multiple males.

==Identification and systematics==


The specificity of bird calls has been used extensively for species identification. The calls of birds have been described using words or nonsense syllables or line diagrams. Common terms in English include words such as &quot;quack&quot;, &quot;chirp&quot; and &quot;chirrup&quot;. These are subject to imagination and vary greatly; a well-known example is the white-throated sparrow&#x27;s song, given in Canada as &quot;O sweet Canada Canada Canada&quot; and in New England as &quot;Old Sam Peabody Peabody Peabody&quot; (also &quot;Where are you Frederick Frederick Frederick?&quot;). In addition to nonsense words, grammatically correct phrases have been constructed as likenesses of the vocalizations of birds. For example, the barred owl produces a motif which some bird guides describe as &quot;Who cooks for you? Who cooks for you all?&quot; with the emphasis placed on &quot;you&quot;. The term &quot;warblish&quot; has been coined to explain this approach to bird call description. Musical notation to depict bird sound began with Athanasius Kircher in his &quot;Musurgia universalis&quot; (1650) but more careful use was attempted with enhancements in the twentieth century by the Germans Alwin Voigt, Cornel Schmitt, and Hans Stadler.

Kay Electric Company, started by former Bell Labs engineers Harry Foster and Elmo Crump, made a device that was marketed as the &quot;Sona-Graph&quot; in 1948. This was adopted by early researchers including C.E.G. Bailey who demonstrated its use for studying bird song in 1950. The use of spectrograms to visualize bird song was then adopted by Donald J. Borror and developed further by others including W. H. Thorpe. These visual representations are also called sonograms or . Beginning in 1983, some field guides for birds use sonograms to document the calls and songs of birds. The sonogram is objective, unlike descriptive phrases, but proper interpretation requires experience. Sonograms can also be roughly converted back into sound.

Bird song is an integral part of bird courtship and is a pre-zygotic isolation mechanism involved in the process of speciation. Many allopatric subspecies show differences in calls. These differences are sometimes minute, often detectable only in the sonograms. Song differences in addition to other taxonomic attributes have been used in the identification of new species. The use of calls has led to proposals for splitting of species complexes such as those of the &quot;Mirafra&quot; bushlarks.

Smartphone apps can identify birds using sounds. These apps work by comparing against spectrographic databases for matches.

==Bird language==

The language of the birds has long been a topic for anecdote and speculation. That calls have meanings that are interpreted by their listeners has been well demonstrated. Domestic chickens have distinctive alarm calls for aerial and ground predators, and they respond to these alarm calls appropriately.

However, a language has, in addition to words, grammar (that is, structures and rules). Studies to demonstrate the existence of language have been difficult because of the range of possible interpretations. For instance, some have argued that in order for a communication system to count as a language it must be &quot;combinatorial&quot;, having an open-ended set of grammar-compliant sentences made from a finite vocabulary.

Research on parrots by Irene Pepperberg is claimed to demonstrate the innate ability for grammatical structures, including the existence of concepts such as nouns, adjectives and verbs. In the wild, the innate vocalizations of black-capped chickadees have been rigorously shown to exhibit combinatorial language. Studies on starling vocalizations have also suggested that they may have recursive structures.

The term &quot;bird language&quot; may also more informally refer to patterns in bird vocalizations that communicate information to other birds or other animals in general.

Some birds have two distinct &quot;languages&quot; — one for internal communications and one for use in flocks. All birds have a separate type of communication for &quot;songs&quot; vs. communicating danger and other information. Konrad Lorenz demonstrated that jackdaws have &quot;names&quot; identifying each individual in the flock and when beginning flight preparations each of them says one other bird&#x27;s name creating a &quot;chain&quot;. In his book &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Ring&quot;, Lorenz describes the name he was given by the birds and how he was recognized several years later in a far away location following WWII.

Studies in parakeets have shown a striking similarity between a talking bird&#x27;s verbal areas in the brain and the equivalent human brain areas, suggesting that mimicry has much to do with the construction of language and its structures and order. Research in 2016 showed that birds construct sentence-like communications with a syntax and grammar.

==In culture==

===Recording===
The first known recording of birdsong was made in 1889 by Ludwig Koch, who went on to become an eminent wildlife recordist and BBC natural history presenter.

Other notable birdsong recordists include Eric Simms, Chris Watson, Boris Veprintsev (Soviet Union), and, in France, Claude Chappuis, Jean-Claude Roché, François Charron and Fernand Deroussen.

===In music===
In music, birdsong has influenced composers and musicians in several ways: they can be inspired by birdsong; they can intentionally imitate bird song in a composition, as Vivaldi and Beethoven did, along with many later composers, such as Messiaen; they can incorporate recordings of birds into their works, as Ottorino Respighi first did; or like Beatrice Harrison and David Rothenberg, they can duet with birds. Authors including Rothenberg have claimed that birds sing on traditional scales as used in human music, but at least one songbird does not choose notes in this way.

Among birds which habitually borrow phrases or sounds from other species, the way they use variations of rhythm, relationships of musical pitch, and combinations of notes can resemble music. Hollis Taylor&#x27;s in-depth analysis of pied butcherbird vocalizations provides a detailed rebuttal to objections of birdsong being judged as music. The similar motor constraints on human and avian song may have driven these to have similar song structures, including &quot;arch-shaped and descending melodic contours in musical phrases&quot;, long notes at the ends of phrases, and typically small differences in pitch between adjacent notes, at least in birds with a strong song structure like the Eurasian treecreeper &quot;Certhia familiaris&quot;.

==In poetry==
Bird song is a popular subject in poetry. Famous examples inspired by bird song include the 1177 Persian poem &quot;The Conference of the Birds&quot;, in which the birds of the world assemble under the wisest bird, the hoopoe, to decide who is to be their king. In English poetry, John Keats&#x27;s 1819 &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; and Percy Bysshe Shelley&#x27;s 1820 &quot;To a Skylark&quot; are popular classics. Ted Hughes&#x27;s 1970 collection of poems about a bird character, &quot;Crow&quot;, is considered one of his most important works. Bird poems by Gerard Manley Hopkins include &quot;Sea and Skylark&quot; and &quot;The Windhover&quot;.

<text>In heraldry, the field (background) of a shield can be divided into more than one area, or subdivision, of different tinctures, usually following the lines of one of the ordinaries and carrying its name (e.g. a shield divided in the shape of a chevron is said to be parted &quot;per chevron&quot;). Shields may be divided this way for &quot;differencing&quot; (to avoid conflict with otherwise similar coats of arms) or for purposes of &quot;marshalling&quot; (combining two or more coats of arms into one), or simply for style. The lines that divide a shield may not always be straight, and there is a system of terminology for describing patterned lines, which is also shared with the heraldic ordinaries.

French heraldry takes a different approach in many cases from the one described in this article.

== Common divisions of the field ==
Common partitions of the field are:
* &quot;parted&quot; (or &quot;party&quot;) &quot;per fess&quot; (halved horizontally)
* &quot;party per pale&quot; (halved vertically)
* &quot;party per bend&quot; (diagonally from viewer’s upper left to lower right)
* &quot;party per bend sinister&quot; (diagonally from viewer’s upper right to lower left)
* &quot;party per saltire&quot; (diagonally both ways)
* &quot;party per cross&quot; or &quot;quarterly&quot; (divided into four quarters)
* &quot;party per chevron&quot; (after the manner of a chevron)
* &quot;party per pall&quot; (divided into three parts in a Y shape)

(In the above &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; are from the viewer&#x27;s perspective, whereas the heraldic terms &quot;sinister&quot; and &quot;dexter&quot; are from the perspective of the person carrying the shield.) Nowadays, however, the &#x27;party&#x27; is often omitted, even in &#x27;official&#x27; blazons, e.g. in letters patent and extracts of matriculation.

A field cannot be divided &quot;per bordure&quot; (as, if this did exist, it would be indistinguishable from the bordure), but a bordure can be divided or counter-changed.

Neither can a field (nor any charge) be divided &quot;per chief&quot;, for similar reasons; though both Canadian and Scottish Public Registers have official records of fields or bordures divided &#x27;per chief&#x27;. The earliest such record in the Scottish Public Register is before 1677, &quot;parted per chief azure and gules three skenes argent hefted and pomelled Or Surmounted of as many Woolf-heads couped of the third.&quot; and a bordure per chief is shown in the arms of Roy, Canada. A chief is considered a charge in English heraldry and is considered layered atop the field.

Shields may also be divided into three parts: this is called &quot;tierced&quot;, as in &quot;tierced per pale, azure, argent and gules&quot; (though perhaps in English heraldry this is rarely if ever done, and the foregoing shield would be blazoned — as the pale is supposed to be one-third of the width of the field and is always so depicted under these circumstances — &quot;per pale azure and gules, a pale argent.&quot; but Scottish heraldry does use &#x27;tierced in pale&#x27; (e.g. Clackmannan county (now Clackmannanshire) has &quot;Or; a saltire gules; a chief tierced in pale vert, argent, vert ...&quot;) A particular type of tiercing, resembling a Y in shape (division lines per bend and bend sinister coming down from the chief, meeting at the fess point, and continuing down per pale), is called &quot;per pall&quot; (also &quot;per pairle&quot;). The arms of Pope Benedict XVI is &quot;tierced in mantle&quot; – as described in Vatican information pages, but the usual term in, for example South African heraldry, is &quot;chapé ployé&quot; (with arched lines, with straight lines: &quot;chapé&quot; (mantled)), which may be blazoned with three tinctures or just two – e.g. Okakarara Technical Institute: &quot;Gules, chapé Azure, on the partition lines respectively a bend and a bend sinister enhanced, in base a demi-cogwheel, Or, with a fountain issuant.&quot; Shields may also be divided into three parts by a combination of two methods of division, such as &quot;party per fess, in chief per pale&quot;. Another example is in the arms of Clive Cheesman: &quot;per pale and per pall&quot;. This is to be distinguished from the essentially unique partition in the arms of the 2nd Weather Group of the United States Air Force, which is &quot;Dexter per chevron ployé and sinister per fess enhanced&quot;.

=== Chaussé ===
A shield may also be &quot;party per chevron reversed (inverted)&quot;, which is like party per chevron except upside down. A section formed by two (straight) lines drawn from the corners of the chief to the point in base is called &quot;chaussé&quot; (shod), which must be distinguished from the &quot;pile&quot;, the point of which does not reach the bottom of the shield. With arched or bent (French: &quot;&quot;) lines it is called &quot;chaussé ployé&quot;.
== Marshalling ==

One common reason for dividing the field in heraldry is for purposes of combining two or more coats of arms to express alliance, inheritance, occupation of an office, etc. This practice, called &quot;marshalling&quot;, initially took the form of dimidiation, or splicing together two coats of arms split down the middle (or sometimes, though rarely, split across the centre &quot;per fess&quot; or quarterly) so that half one coat was matched up with the opposite half of the other. As this would sometimes yield confusing or misleading results, the practice was supplanted by impalement, which kept both coats intact and simply squished them into half the space. According to Fox-Davies (1909), the practice of &quot;dimidiation&quot; was short-lived and had already reached its peak in the early 14th century, while impalement remains in practice to modern times. One important remainder of the practice, however, is that when a coat of arms with a bordure is impaled with another coat, the bordure does not continue down the centre, but stops short where it meets the line of impalement. Eventually quartering gained usage, and in the height of its popularity during the Victorian era, some coats of arms featured hundreds of &quot;quarterings&quot; (see the Grenville arms at right). More usually, however, a quartered coat of arms consisted of four parts, as the name suggests. The origin and underlying purpose of quartering is to express inheritance by female succession: when a female heir (who has no brothers, or whose brothers have all preceded her in death) dies, her son (only &quot;after&quot; her death) quarters her arms with those of his father, placing the father&#x27;s arms in the first (upper left) and fourth (lower right) quarters and his mother&#x27;s arms in the second (upper right) and third (lower left).
In the UK heraldries, complex systems of marshalling have developed, and continue to thrive, around heraldic expressions of inheritance. In many cases of marriage, the shield is &quot;impaled&quot; with the husband&#x27;s entire coat of arms placed on the dexter side and the wife&#x27;s entire coat placed on the sinister side; if the wife is an heiress, however, her arms are placed in escutcheon over her husband&#x27;s (such usage is almost entirely English, Scots marshalling being impaling like any other marriage arms). If the husband is a knight of any order, however, the ensigns of that order belong only to him and are not shared with his wife. Two separate shields are then employed, the dexter shield bearing the husband&#x27;s arms within the circle of his knighthood, and the sinister shield bearing the husband&#x27;s arms impaled with the wife&#x27;s usually encircled with a meaningless wreath of oak leaves for artistic balance. A male peer impales the arms of his wife as described above, but including the supporters, coronet and helmet of the peer; if he is also a knight of any order, the two-shield method is used. If a female peer marries a commoner, however, the husband places her arms inescutcheon, surmounted by a coronet of her rank, over his own, but the supporters of her rank cannot be conferred to him; the wife bears her arms singly on a lozenge with the supporters and coronet of her rank. Volumes may be written on all the endless heraldic possibilities of this convoluted system of marshalling, but it may suffice here to say that for various purposes, arms may be marshalled by four basic methods: &quot;dimidiation&quot; by clipping and splicing two coats (usually per pale), &quot;impalement&quot; by dividing per pale and crowding an entire coat of arms into each half, &quot;quartering&quot; by dividing the shield into usually four (but potentially innumerable) &quot;quarters&quot;, and &quot;superimposition&quot; by placing one coat of arms inescutcheon over another. It is also worth noting that one common form in German-Nordic heraldry is &quot;quarterly with a heart&quot; (a shield quartered with an inescutcheon overall). This may have stemmed from the continental practice of sovereigns placing their own hereditary arms inescutcheon over the arms of their dominions.
The arms of Zviahel, Ukraine, show an unusual form of marshalling quarterly with a heart, where one quarter is dimidiated while the others are not.

== Lines of division ==

Divisions of the field, like the ordinaries, may follow complex line shapes. Most of these &quot;sections&quot; have developed conventional names in English, but modern artists, particularly in Finland, have developed new sections influenced by shapes found in the local flora. Among the most common of these are engrailed, invected, indented, dancetty, wavy (also called undy), nebuly, embattled, raguly, dovetailed and potenty (pictured below). Notable modern forms include the &quot;fir twig section&quot; () and &quot;fir tree top section&quot; (). These can be found in the arms of a number of municipalities in Finland, and the latter can also be found in the arms of Mullsjö Municipality in Sweden.

== Other modifications ==

Besides the complex lines discussed above, divisions of the field may also be modified in other ways. Sometimes the division of the field may be &quot;fimbriated&quot; (lined) or, perhaps less properly, &quot;edged&quot; of another tincture, or &quot;divided by&quot; some ordinary or its diminutive. The latter differs from a parted field that then bears the ordinary, in that if the ordinary thus dividing the field is between charges, the charges are not overlapped by the ordinary but the ordinary is between them. A famous example of this is the greater arms of Sweden, which is &quot;quartered by a cross Or...&quot;

One division of the field (though it is sometimes described as a charge) is restricted to the chief: when the chief is divided by a bow-shaped line, this is called a &quot;chapournet&quot; or &quot;chaperonnet&quot; (&quot;little hood&quot;). &quot;Rompu&quot;, meaning &quot;broken&quot;, is often applied to a chevron, where the center is usually broken and &quot;enhanced&quot; (brought to a sharper point than normal).

== Unusual forms ==
* When the partition lines form four L-shapes, the field is blazoned &quot;quarterly en equerre&quot; (viz. &quot;framing square&quot;, ).
* A number of divisions are unique to German heraldry, including &quot;per bend... broken in the form of a linden leaf&quot;.
* The arms of the former Republic of Bophuthatswana were &quot;per fess (at nombril point)&quot; (lower than the regular per fess division; the &quot;nombril point&quot; is halfway between the fess point — the exact middle of the field — and the base point, at the bottom centre of the field).
* The arms of the French department of Côtes-d&#x27;Armor show &quot;émanché&quot;, which is shown in this case as equivalent to the English &quot;per fess dancetty of two full points upwards&quot;.
* The arms of Mpumalanga Province in South Africa show &quot;per bend sinister, inclined in the flanks per fess&quot;.

<text>This is a glossary of tensor theory. For expositions of tensor theory from different points of view, see:

* Tensor
* Tensor (intrinsic definition)
* Application of tensor theory in engineering science

For some history of the abstract theory see also multilinear algebra.

==Classical notation==

;Ricci calculus
:The earliest foundation of tensor theory – tensor index notation.

;Order of a tensor
:The components of a tensor with respect to a basis is an indexed array. The &quot;order&quot; of a tensor is the number of indices needed. Some texts may refer to the tensor order using the term &quot;degree&quot; or &quot;rank&quot;.

;Rank of a tensor
:The rank of a tensor is the minimum number of rank-one tensor that must be summed to obtain the tensor. A rank-one tensor may be defined as expressible as the outer product of the number of nonzero vectors needed to obtain the correct order.

;Dyadic tensor
:A &quot;dyadic&quot; tensor is a tensor of order two, and may be represented as a square matrix. In contrast, a &quot;dyad&quot; is specifically a dyadic tensor of rank one.

;Einstein notation
:This notation is based on the understanding that whenever a multidimensional array contains a repeated index letter, the default interpretation is that the product is summed over all permitted values of the index. For example, if &quot;aij&quot; is a matrix, then under this convention &quot;aii&quot; is its trace. The Einstein convention is widely used in physics and engineering texts, to the extent that if summation is not to be applied, it is normal to note that explicitly.

;Kronecker delta

;Levi-Civita symbol

;Covariant tensor

;Contravariant tensor
:The classical interpretation is by components. For example, in the differential form &quot;aidxi&quot; the components &quot;ai&quot; are a covariant vector. That means all indices are lower; contravariant means all indices are upper.

;Mixed tensor
:This refers to any tensor that has both lower and upper indices.

;Cartesian tensor
:Cartesian tensors are widely used in various branches of continuum mechanics, such as fluid mechanics and elasticity. In classical continuum mechanics, the space of interest is usually 3-dimensional Euclidean space, as is the tangent space at each point. If we restrict the local coordinates to be Cartesian coordinates with the same scale centered at the point of interest, the metric tensor is the Kronecker delta. This means that there is no need to distinguish covariant and contravariant components, and furthermore there is no need to distinguish tensors and tensor densities. All Cartesian-tensor indices are written as subscripts. Cartesian tensors achieve considerable computational simplification at the cost of generality and of some theoretical insight.

;Contraction of a tensor

;Raising and lowering indices

;Symmetric tensor

;Antisymmetric tensor

;Multiple cross products

==Algebraic notation==
This avoids the initial use of components, and is distinguished by the explicit use of the tensor product symbol.

;Tensor product
:If &quot;v&quot; and &quot;w&quot; are vectors in vector spaces &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; respectively, then
::formula_1
:is a tensor in
::formula_2
:That is, the ⊗ operation is a binary operation, but it takes values into a fresh space (it is in a strong sense &quot;external&quot;). The ⊗ operation is a bilinear map; but no other conditions are applied to it.

;Pure tensor
:A pure tensor of &quot;V&quot; ⊗ &quot;W&quot; is one that is of the form &quot;v&quot; ⊗ &quot;w&quot;.
:It could be written dyadically &quot;aibj&quot;, or more accurately &quot;aibj&quot; e&quot;i&quot; ⊗ f&quot;j&quot;, where the e&quot;i&quot; are a basis for &quot;V&quot; and the f&quot;j&quot; a basis for &quot;W&quot;. Therefore, unless &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; have the same dimension, the array of components need not be square. Such &quot;pure&quot; tensors are not generic: if both &quot;V&quot; and &quot;W&quot; have dimension greater than 1, there will be tensors that are not pure, and there will be non-linear conditions for a tensor to satisfy, to be pure. For more see Segre embedding.

;Tensor algebra
:In the tensor algebra &quot;T&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) of a vector space &quot;V&quot;, the operation formula_3 becomes a normal (internal) binary operation. A consequence is that &quot;T&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) has infinite dimension unless &quot;V&quot; has dimension 0. The free algebra on a set &quot;X&quot; is for practical purposes the same as the tensor algebra on the vector space with &quot;X&quot; as basis.

;Hodge star operator

;Exterior power

:The wedge product is the anti-symmetric form of the ⊗ operation. The quotient space of &quot;T&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) on which it becomes an internal operation is the &quot;exterior algebra&quot; of &quot;V&quot;; it is a graded algebra, with the graded piece of weight &quot;k&quot; being called the &quot;k&quot;-th exterior power of &quot;V&quot;.

;Symmetric power, symmetric algebra
:This is the invariant way of constructing polynomial algebras.

==Applications==

;Stress–energy tensor

==Tensor field theory==

==Abstract algebra==
;Tensor product of fields
:This is an operation on fields, that does not always produce a field.

;Tensor product of R-algebras

;Clifford module
:A representation of a Clifford algebra which gives a realisation of a Clifford algebra as a matrix algebra.

;Tor functors
:These are the derived functors of the tensor product, and feature strongly in homological algebra. The name comes from the torsion subgroup in abelian group theory.

;Symbolic method of invariant theory

;Derived category

;Grothendieck&#x27;s six operations
:These are &quot;highly&quot; abstract approaches used in some parts of geometry.

<text>Umm el-Marra, (), east of modern Aleppo in the Jabbul Plain of northern Syria, was one of the ancient Near East&#x27;s oldest cities, located on a crossroads of two trade routes northwest of Ebla, in a landscape that was much more fertile than it is today. Possibly this is the city of Tuba mentioned in Egyptian inscriptions listing cities that were defeated or destroyed in the Pharaoh Thutmose III&#x27;s north Syrian campaign. The city of Tuba is also mentioned
in epigraphic remains from Ebla, Mari, and Alalakh.

==History==
=== Early Bronze ===
Umm el-Marra VI:
In the Early Bronze III (c. 2750/2700-2350 BC), Umm el-Marra was an important hub with about 3000-5000 inhabitants. At the beginning of this period, the region was wetter than today, but by 2500 BC climate became gradually drier.

====Ebla Period====
Umm el-Marra V-IV:
In the Early Bronze IV (c. 2350-2000 BC), the dry climate intensified and cities on the Jabbul Plain experienced a collapse of central authority between 2200-2000 BC (4.2 ka event). A possible explanation may lie in the effects of sustained drought on overstressed primitive agriculture. Dr. Glenn Schwartz of Johns Hopkins, who conducted field archaeology at Umm el-Marra, suggested in 1994 that &quot;they placed extensive demands on their environments, continually intensifying their agriculture to feed more people. The added stress from a few dry years may have been the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back.&quot; Level V contains Tomb 1 with pottery similar to Mardikh IIB1 Ebla Palace G.

=== Middle Bronze ===
Umm el-Marra Level IIId:
In the Transitional EB IV-MB I, the site was never completely abandoned. Thus, this region saw some continuation as opposed to a collapse following the severe drought conditions that had prevailed. In the MB I (c. 2000-1820 BC) it gradually recovered.

====Yamhad Period====
Umm el-Marra Levels IIIa-c:
In the MB IIA (c. 1820 BC), the city saw a renaissance while controlled by the Amorites. At this time, it became a regional capital subject to the Great Kingdom of Yamkhad centered on Aleppo. A series of public works saw the construction of ramparts with a mudbrick city wall.

=== Late Bronze ===
====Mitanni Period====
During the Late Bronze, the site was under the control of various powers. It would at one point have been under the Mitanni Empire, and Thutmose III of Egypt might have campaigned in the area.

====Hittite Period====
Following the military campaigns of Suppiluliuma I, it became part of the Hittite Empire following the Fall of Carchemish and the death of Tushratta of Mitanni around 1345 BC. The site was destroyed in the 14th century BC.

The Late Bronze Age collapse saw the city completely abandoned by 1200/1190 BC.

===Classical Period===
After a long period of abandonment, the site was re-occupied in the Hellenistic and Roman periods.

==Archaeology==
The site covers around 25 hectares. It was surrounded with a city wall
with 3 gates and a defensive ditch.
Excavation of Umm el-Marra began in the late 1970s and early 1980s with
soundings by a Belgian team led by Roland Tefnin.
From 1994 until 2010, a joint archaeological team from the Johns Hopkins University and
the University of Amsterdam worked at Umm el-Marra.

A rare intact, unlooted tomb, ca. 2300 BCE, uncovered by Dr. Schwartz&#x27;s team in 2000 at the site, made science press headlines, for it contained five richly-adorned adults and three babies, some of whom were ornamented head-to-toe in gold and silver.

It may be the oldest intact possibly royal tomb yet to be found in Syria. Dr. Schwartz noted of peculiar aspects in the burial that they &#x27;may hint at ritual characteristics, rather than a tomb simply reserved for royalty or elite individuals.&#x27; The interment, which was above ground in ancient times, included three layers of skeletons in wooden coffins lined with textiles. The top layer includes traces of two coffins, each containing a young woman in her twenties and a baby. The women were the most richly ornamented of all the occupants of the tomb, with jewelry of silver, gold and lapis lazuli. Also of interest on this level was an accompanying lump of iron, possibly from a meteorite. Geochemical analysis of the iron, based on the ratio of iron to nickel and cobalt, confirms that the iron was meteoritic in origin. One of the babies appeared to be wearing a bronze torque, or collar.

In the layer below were coffins of two adult males and the remains of a baby at some distance from both men, close to the entrance of the tomb. This differs from the placement of the babies in the upper layer, where they were placed next to the women&#x27;s bodies. Crowning the older man was a silver diadem decorated with a disk bearing a rosette motif, while the man opposite had a bronze dagger. The third and lowest layer held an adult male with a silver cup and silver pins.

All the individuals were accompanied by scores of ceramic vessels, some of which contained animal bones that may have been part of funerary animal offerings. Outside the tomb to the south, against the tomb wall, was a jar containing the remains of a baby, a spouted jar, and two skulls, horselike but apparently belonging neither to horses or donkeys. These equids were subsequently identified as kunga, a hybrid of domestic donkey and wild ass.

Incisions on four clay cylinders dated to c. 2400 BC have been hypothesized to be Early Alphabetic Semitic writing, which would make them the oldest such examples.

==Modern village==

In 2004, Umm el-Marra had a population of 1,878.

<doc id="369983" wikidata="Q1572584" url="?curid=369983" title="Semisonic">
<text>Semisonic is an American rock band formed in Minneapolis in 1995, consisting of Dan Wilson (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), John Munson (bass, keyboards, backing vocals, guitar), and Jacob Slichter (drums, percussion, keyboards, backing vocals). They are best known in the U.S. for their 1998 top-20 single &quot;Closing Time&quot;.

==History==
===Formation and debut album===
After the breakup of Trip Shakespeare, Wilson and Munson joined up with drummer Slichter to form the band Pleasure in 1993. By 1995, they had changed their name to Semisonic. An EP, &quot;Pleasure&quot;, was released that year on Boston indie label CherryDisc, and the studio full-length &quot;Great Divide&quot; in 1996 on MCA.

===Breakthrough and international success===
Semisonic&#x27;s breakthrough came two years later in 1998 when their second album, &quot;Feeling Strangely Fine&quot;, reached the Top 50 chart on the strength of the hit single &quot;Closing Time&quot;, their biggest hit in the United States. During a 2008 performance at Harvard&#x27;s Sanders Theatre, Wilson said that it was originally written about the birth of his first child.

Their international career also blossomed when another song from the album, &quot;Secret Smile&quot;, quickly became a UK radio favorite in the summer of 1999, eventually peaking at No. 12 on the UK Singles Chart.

===Third album and hiatus===
In early 2001, the band released its third album, &quot;All About Chemistry,&quot; The single &quot;Chemistry&quot; was a mainstay overseas; however the album did not fare as well in the United States. Another song, &quot;Over My Head&quot;, was used in the 2001 teen flick &quot;Summer Catch&quot;, and Semisonic rode the wave touring various cities in and around the UK.
Wilson had spoken about doing more Semisonic music in the future but said, &quot;The busy day-to-day life keeps pushing it further into the future.&quot; &quot;All About Chemistry&quot; would be their last studio release until reconvening for the &quot;You&#x27;re Not Alone&quot; EP which they put out in 2020.

===2017–2019===

To commemorate the twentieth anniversary of their first album, &quot;Great Divide&quot;, the band reunited for a series of three shows in June 2017 – June 14 at a small club in St. Paul, and June 16–17 at First Avenue in Minneapolis. The band played Great Divide in its entirety.

In December 2017, the band played three more shows in the Twin Cities to commemorate the approaching 20th anniversary of their second album, Feeling Strangely Fine, performing the album in its entirety. In 2018, Feeling Strangely Fine was given a rerelease for the album&#x27;s twentieth anniversary, including its first vinyl pressing. The anniversary edition included four songs not on the original album: &quot;Long Way from Home&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m a Liar&quot;, &quot;Beautiful Regret&quot;, and &quot;Makin&#x27; a Plan&quot;.

In July 2019, Semisonic performed at Summerfest in Milwaukee and then at the Basilica Block Party in Minneapolis. During their 2017–2019 shows, the band performed some new, previously unreleased songs, including &quot;Basement Tapes&quot;, &quot;All It Would Take&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;re Not Alone&quot;

===First Avenue===
The band has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star &quot;might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis&quot;, according to journalist Steve Marsh. Wilson and Munson&#x27;s previous group, Trip Shakespeare, also has a star making them among the few musicians with multiple stars on the mural.

===2020–present===
On June 26, 2020, Semisonic released the single &quot;You&#x27;re Not Alone&quot;, their first new material in 19 years, and later released the full &quot;You&#x27;re Not Alone&quot; EP on September 18, 2020.

On January 27 and 28, 2023, the band played two shows at First Avenue to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the shows’ sponsor, Twin Cities public radio station The Current.

Semisonic supported Barenaked Ladies from June 2, 2023 through June 26, 2023 on the Last Summer on Earth 2023 tour.

In the summer of 2023, the band also began releasing singles from its upcoming album, &quot;Little Bit of Sun&quot;. On June 5, Semisonic released the singles “Little Bit of Sun” and “Grow Your Own.”  On August 1, another single, &quot;The Rope,&quot; was released, along with a video for the song made by Phil Harder.  On September 12, the band released “Out of the Dirt,” co-written by Lori McKenna and featuring Jason Isbell on guitar.

The full album of twelve songs, &quot;Little Bit of Sun&quot;, was released on November 3, 2023.

<doc id="369985" wikidata="Q202504" url="?curid=369985" title="Eurasian dotterel">
<text>The Eurasian dotterel (Eudromias morinellus), also known in Europe as just dotterel, is a small wader in the plover family of birds. It is the only species placed in the genus Eudromias.

The dotterel is a brown-and-black-streaked bird with a broad, white eye stripe and an orange-red chest band when in breeding plumage. The female is more colourful than the male. The bird is tame and unsuspecting, and the term &quot;dotterel&quot; has been applied contemptuously to mean an old fool.

The Eurasian dotterel is a migratory species, breeding in Northern Europe and Eurosiberia and migrating south to North Africa and the Middle East in the winter. It nests in a bare scrape on the ground and lays two to four eggs. The male does the incubation and rears the chicks, with the female having gone off to find another male and lay another clutch of eggs. It is a common bird with a wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The Eurasian dotterel was formerly described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Charadrius morinellus&quot;. The species was moved from &quot;Charadrius&quot; to the resurrected genus &quot;Eudromias&quot; when phylogenetic studies found that &quot;Charadrius&quot; was paraphyletic. The genus &quot;Eudromias&quot; had been originally introduced in 1830 by the German ornithologist Christian Ludwig Brehm. The genus name &quot;Eudromias&quot; is Ancient Greek meaning &quot;good runner&quot;. The specific &quot; morinellus&quot; is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;moros&quot; meaning &quot;foolish&quot;, due to the bird&#x27;s trusting nature.

The English name dates from 1440 when it was used to refer to the bird and also as an insult for someone considered simple or a dotard. Which use is the oldest is unclear, but the link is its tame and unsuspecting nature, which made it easy to catch; its Scottish Gaelic name is &quot;amadan-mòintich&quot;, &quot;fool of the moors.&quot; King James VI and I went every year to Royston, Hertfordshire, to shoot dotterels. It was also easy prey for illegal poaching, which depleted its stocks. It was also prized as a delicacy; in 1534, Queen Anne Boleyn was presented with &quot;a brace of dotterels&quot;.

==Description==
This plover is smaller and more compact than European golden plover (&quot;Pluvialis apricaria&quot;). It has a striking whitish supercilium in all plumages and has plain wings in flight. Adults in summer are unmistakable, with a chestnut breast bordered above with white, black belly, and warm-brown back. The legs are yellow, and the short bill is black. As with the phalaropes, the female is brighter than the male. Winter birds lack the rich underpart colouration, apart from the white breast line, and are greyer above. Young birds are similar, but have a scaly appearance to their backs. The flight call is a soft &quot;&quot;. The female&#x27;s song is a simple, repetitive whistle.

==Distribution and habitat==
It breeds in the Arctic tundra of northern Eurosiberia, from Norway to eastern Siberia, and on suitable mountain plateaus such as the Scottish highlands and the Alps. This species is migratory, wintering in a narrow belt across north Africa from Morocco eastwards to Iran. Migration stopovers are traditional, and small parties (&quot;trips&quot;) of dotterels pass through each year at these usually inland arable or grassy sites. The winter habitat is semi-desert.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The dotterel&#x27;s diet is made up of insects and other small invertebrates such as snails, worms, and shellfish. These are obtained by a run-and-pause technique, rather than the steady probing used by other waders.

The male dotterel generally is responsible for incubation and looks after the chicks. In most cases, the cock dotterel successfully prevents other males from getting his mate and fertilizing her eggs. He usually rears chicks that he has fathered and only 4.6% (2/44) of chicks were not the genetic offspring of the caring male, corresponding to 9.1% (2/22) broods affected.

==Status==
It is a relatively common species with a wide range. Populations seem to be declining slowly, but not alarmingly so, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it as a &quot;least-concern species&quot;. A survey published in 2015 showed a fall in dotterel numbers in Scotland between 1987 and 2011, from 980 to 423 breeding males - representing a decline of 57%. 
The Eurasian dotterel is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; applies.

<text>The lines in heraldry used to divide and vary fields and charges are by default straight, but may have many different shapes. Care must be taken to distinguish these types of lines from the use of lines as charges, and to distinguish these shapes from actual charges, such as &quot;a mount [or triple mount] in base,&quot; or, particularly in German heraldry, different kinds of embattled from castle walls.

In Scotland, varied lines of partition are often used to modify a bordure (or sometimes another ordinary) to difference the arms of a cadet from the chief of the house.

== Different shapes of lines ==
=== Indented and dancetty ===

An ordinary &quot;indented&quot; is bounded by small zigzags like a triangle wave or the teeth of a saw, with peaks on one side matching peaks on the other. An ordinary &quot;dancetty&quot; is similar, but with peaks matching troughs, so that the width is constant; it also typically has fewer points than &quot;indented&quot;. In early armory these were not distinguished. In the arms of the 55th Electronic Combat Group of the United States Air Force the indented is &quot;edged wider on the back angle (sinister) than on the face (dexter) of each angle&quot;.

&quot;Dentilly&quot; is a modern invention, similar to &quot;indented&quot;, but with one of the sides of the points perpendicular and the other angled, as in a sawtooth wave.

&quot;Rayonné&quot; (also &quot;rayonne&quot;, &quot;rayonny&quot;; from French &quot;&quot;) may be considered a variant of indented, but with wavy instead of straight lines, as in the conventional representation of rays of the sun. &quot;Rayonne palewise&quot; appears in the arms of the 172d Support Battalion of the United States Army. A chief enarched rayonné on a gold field appears in the arms of Sechelt, British Columbia, forming the appearance of a sun.

The arms of the Worshipful Company of Security Professionals contain an example of &quot;indented acute,&quot; a form of indented with higher peaks.

The number of peaks in indented is almost never specified, but an exception is the arms of Arthur D. Stairs: &quot;Per bend sinister indented of six steps Gules and Sable&quot;, and Westville, Natal, South Africa bears &quot;Sable, issuant from behind a fence of spears in base Argent, a fig tree in leaf Or; on a chief indented of four points to base, also Or, three lion&#x27;s faces Sable&quot;.

In South Africa there are a number of examples of &quot;dancetty inverted&quot;. While the number of peaks in dancetty are three unless otherwise specified, the arms of Wagland show &quot;dancetty of two points&quot; and the arms of Baz Manning show a chief &quot;dancetty of two full points upwards&quot;. The arms of the Matroosberg Transitional Representative Council in South Africa give an example of &quot;dancetty… in the shape of a letter W&quot;. The arms of the French department of Côtes d&#x27;Armor show &quot;émanché,&quot; which would be equivalent to the English &quot;per fess dancetty of two full points upwards.&quot; The arms of Baron Griffiths of Fforestfach are &quot;Paly of four Vert and Argent per fess enhanced indented of two points upwards each point double barbed throughout issuing in base a pile double barbed throughout all counterchanged&quot;. The arms of Alaric John Martin Woodrow show an example of &quot;barry dancetty each point double barbed&quot;, used to represent a line of fir trees as a play on the surname. The arms of the Free State in South Africa show &quot;a chief dancetty, the peaks terminating in merlons&quot;, and so might be called a combination of dancetty and embattled; a similar hybrid can be seen in the arms of the Agricultural Gymnasium. Hoerskool Hangklip provide an example of &quot;dancetty with points flattened&quot;, and Blouberg of &quot;dancetty the peaks couped.&quot; It is difficult to know whether to characterise the &quot;wall-like extremity with five merlons and four embrasures&quot; in the arms of the Kurgan Oblast in Russia as a divided field or a charge.

The arms of Ernest John Altobello show a chevron with the upper edge &quot;grady&quot; (this is identical in appearance to indented) &quot;and ensigned of a tower Argent&quot;.

=== Wavy and nebuly ===

A line &quot;wavy&quot; (also called &quot;undy&quot;) is a sine wave, often used to represent water; a line &quot;nebuly&quot; is similar but with more exaggerated meanders, representing clouds. There are confusing, ambiguous and non-standard uses of &quot;a wavy&quot; in the military heraldry of the United States to refer to irregularly wavy lines.

The wavy chief in the arms of Lord Nelson was blazoned as &quot;undulated&quot;.

The field of the arms of the 40th Finance Battalion of the United States Army is blazoned &quot;per fess wavy (in the manner of a Taeguk)&quot;.

In &quot;wavy crested&quot; the waves appear like pointed breakers.
The arms of James Hill show an example of barrulets &quot;wavy crested to the sinister on the upper edge&quot;.
The chief in the arms of Professor S.W. Haines is &quot;wavy of one crest and depressed in the centre of one point&quot;.

There are examples of even greater complexity and specificity in the &quot;wavy&quot; line, such as the arms of &quot;Baron Nolan ... [which include] three &#x27;bars wavy couped composed of two troughs and a wave invected of one point on the upper edge and engrailed of one point on the lower edge&#x27;&quot;.

Specification of the number of &quot;undulations&quot; in nebuly can be seen by Jochen Wilke&#x27;s roundel, with ten. (It is uncommon for lines of partition to modify a charge other than an ordinary.)

The Blount family of Worcestershire, England, whose members held the titles of Baron Mountjoy and two baronetcies, bore &quot;Barry nebuly of six or and sable&quot;.
Nebuly lines also appear in the arms of the former borough councils of Fleetwood (Lancashire) and Hyde (Cheshire).

=== Engrailed and invected ===
These lines consist of a series of circular arcs curving in the same direction, meeting at angles, forming points outward (&quot;engrailed&quot;) or inward (&quot;invected&quot;). When these terms are applied to a partition rather than to an ordinary, the first part of the field is the &quot;interior&quot;.

The arms of Liverpool Hope University include &quot;a Cross engrailed of one point on each limb&quot;. The Flag of Flintshire is &quot;Argent a cross engrailed sable between four Cornish choughs proper&quot;.
The arms of the Pretoria Philatelic Society show a &quot;chief engrailed and couped&quot;, having the appearance of the edge of a perforated postage stamp. The arms of Kutlwanong Dorp in South Africa provide an example both of the specification of the number of lobes in invected, and those lobes being &quot;trefly.&quot;

=== Embattled and variants === 
A line &quot;embattled&quot; is a square wave, representing the battlements of a castle.

When a fess is embattled, only the topmost edge is altered (as in the arms of Muri bei Bern). If both edges are to be embattled, the term &quot;embattled-counter-embattled&quot; (or &quot;counter-embattled,&quot; as in the arms of Sir Cecil Denniston Burney) is used. In this case the lines are parallel. If gaps face gaps, the term &quot;bretessé&quot; is used. There is at least one emblazonment suggesting that the orle is only embattled on its outer edge.

Italian armory has a variant, Ghibelline battlement, with notched merlons.
In a line &quot;raguly&quot; the extensions are oblique rather than orthogonal, like the stumps of limbs protruding from a tree-trunk.

&quot;Dovetailed&quot; is as in carpentry. Unlike embattled, gaps face gaps.

&quot;Potenty&quot; may be considered a variant in which the points are extended to &quot;T&quot;-shapes (&quot;potent&quot; means a crutch).

A line &quot;embattled grady&quot; or &quot;battled embattled&quot; consists of series of two or three steps, as if each merlon has a smaller merlon atop it. Parker&#x27;s glossary says that &quot;double-embattled&quot; may be the same as this.

The arms of Schellenberg in Liechtenstein provide an example of embattled &quot;with three battlements&quot;. The bordure in the arms of Boissy l&#x27;Aillerie, in Val d&#x27;Oise, France, has nine battlements (the bordure is also masoned and contains door-like openings).

A very unusual occurrence of embattled occurs in the arms of the 136th Military Police Battalion of the United States Army: &quot;Sable, a fesse enhanced and embattled Or, overall a magnifying glass palewise rim Argent (Silver Gray), the glass surmounting and enlarging the middle crenel between two merlons, the handle Gules edged of the second bearing a mullet Argent.&quot;

The arms of Baron Kirkwood show two chevronels &quot;round embattled&quot; (the merlons are rounded rather than squares). There are also examples of &quot;embattled pointed&quot; and &quot;embattled in the form of mine dumps&quot;.

James Parker cites the arms of Christopher Draisfield: &quot;Gules, a chevron raguly of two bastons couped at the top argent.&quot;

The arms of Zodwa Special School for Severely Mentally Handicapped Children show &quot;a chevron dovetailed, the peak ensigned with a potent issuant&quot;.
Some examples also exist of &quot;urdy,&quot; where the line is in the shapes of the upside-down and rightside-up &quot;shields&quot; of vair (this is to be distinguished from &quot;couped urdy&quot;, in which the couping takes a pointed form). The arms of Winfried Paul Reinhold Steinhagen are &quot;Per chevron, the peak in the form of a merlon round urdy of four, Gules and Or, in chief a horse forcene and a goat clymant respecting one another, Argent, and in base a bull&#x27;s head Sable armed Argent; a chief per fess in the form of a wall with three watchtowers, Azure and Argent, the latter charged with a strand of barbed wire throughout, Sable&quot;. The &quot;unusual, if not unique&quot; arms of Lourens Du Toit are &quot;Per fess of three pallets urdy Sable and Or&quot;.

The arms of the Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons have a bordure emblazoned &quot;dentate&quot;, although this appears to be quite similar to dovetailed.

=== Embowed, nowy and variants ===

A line &quot;embowed&quot; consists of a single arch.

A line &quot;nowy&quot; contains a semicircular protuberance in the middle. A line with an angular protuberance in the middle, like a battlement, is called &quot;escartelly&quot;.

The arms of Laerskool Bosveld in South Africa have a field &quot;Per chevron embowed trefly, Azure and Argent&quot;.

The arms of Léopold-Henri Amyot show &quot;per fess ogivy&quot;; this is based on the ogive or pointed arch.

Chiefs, fesses and palar dividing lines are sometimes seen &quot;arched&quot; and &quot;double-arched&quot; (and there is an example of triple-arched), though there is some debate as to whether or not these are lines of partition. That arched can be combined with partition lines can be seen from the arms of South Lanarkshire in Scotland. Arched can also be &quot;reversed&quot;.

=== Rarer lines and recent inventions ===

The rare line &quot;bevilled&quot; modifies the bendlets in the arms of Thomas Roy Barnes and the pairle in the arms of Rovaniemi, Finland. This lightning-bolt type of line with one zigzag is to be distinguished from &quot;angled&quot;, in which the line takes a pair of 90° turns before continuing parallel to and in the same direction as the old line. There is a South African example of &quot;bevilled to sinister&quot;, and a bend &quot;double bevilled&quot; can be seen in the arms of Philip Kushlick School.

A line &quot;trefly&quot; shows protuberances in the form of trefoils.

The arms of Saint Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in Regina, Saskatchewan contain a bordure &quot;its inner line looping in foils of poplar of the field within the bordure at each angle and at regular intervals between&quot;.

The arms of Carmichael show a fess &quot;wreathy&quot;, which may or may not be strictly speaking a line of partition, but does modify the fess; the coat is not blazoned as a &quot;wreath in fess&quot;. James Parker calls this &quot;tortilly&quot;.

The 20th century saw some innovations in lines of partition. &quot;Erablé&quot;, a series of alternating upright and inverted maple leaves, is a typically Canadian line of partition, though the College of Arms in London has used it in a few grants (but compare the cross &quot;nowy erablé&quot; in the arms of Katherina Fahlman Selinger Schaaf. A Finnish line of partition, invented by Kaj Cajander and called , which is called &quot;fir-tree topped&quot; in Britain, and which the Canadian Heraldic Authority coined the term &quot;sapiné&quot; to blazon, resembles fir trees; in the arms of Guy Selvester this is called &quot;sapinage&quot;. A line resembling fir twigs, and so called in British blazon, is called &quot;sapinagé&quot; in Canada (English and French), and in Finland. Other 20th-century examples of lines, or things akin to lines, include the 1990 grant to Albersdorf-Prebuch in Austria, in which the upper line of the fess takes the form of fruit, the bottom of vine-leaves. (It is debatable what the distinction is between such lines, and examples such as the arms of Bierbaum am Auersbach, a town in Styria, in which three pears grow from a pall.)

The South African Bureau of Heraldry has developed the line of partition &quot;serpentine&quot; (which has also been called &quot;ondoyant&quot;), which is rather like wavy, but with only one &quot;wave&quot;, one complete cycle of a sine wave; the serpentine in the arms of the Mtubatuba Primary School is defined as &quot;dexter to chief and sinister to base&quot;. (Similar is the German (snake-wise).) It has also developed the uniquely South-African lines of division (which can also form the ends of a charge) &quot;nowy of a Cape Town gable&quot; (now called just &quot;nowy gabled&quot;), and &quot;nowy of an Indian cupola&quot;. Similarly, the fess line in the arms of the Council for Social and Associated Workers is &quot;nowy of a trimount inverted&quot;, the fess in the arms of Mossel Bay is &quot;nowy of two Karoo gable houses&quot;, the chief in the arms of the Lenasia South-East Management Committee is &quot;nowy of an Indian cupola&quot;, the chief in the arms of the Genealogical Society of South Africa is &quot;double nowy gably&quot; and that of Frederick Brownell is &quot;gably of three&quot;. The arms of the Reyneke Bond (i.e. Reyneke Family Association) are &quot;Per fess, in each flank double nowy fitchy to base, Azure and Or, a lion rampant per fess of the second and Gules, a chief Or&quot;. The plain chief identifies these as the arms of a family association. The arms of Itsokolele, South Africa include &quot;a chief double fitchy inverted&quot;.

&quot;Broad fitchy couped&quot; is a line of South-African origin similar in appearance to a mine-dump or escartelly with sloping sides.

Chevrons can be topped with a fleur-de-lys, and ordinaries with non-straight edges (particularly if they are dancetty or engrailed) can have the points topped with demi fleurs-de-lys. It has sometimes been said that in some reference works flory-counter-flory (and flory) is treated like a line of partition, even though strictly speaking it is not – though it has been used for centuries that way in the royal arms of Scotland blazoning the double tressure (Public Register of Arms, Lyon Court, Edinburgh) and used by the College of arms in blazoning coats like that of Sutherland of Dunstanburgh Castle (Gules, a chevron flory-counterflory between in chief three mullets and in base a lymphad all or) and is used by the South African Bureau of Heraldry blazoning the coat of Huis Tankotie of the University of Pretoria (Per fess, flory counter-flory, Argent and Azure, in base within the flower an annulet Sable; a bordure counterchanged) and Emmanuel-Opleidingsentrum in the South African Bureau of Heraldry&#x27;s online database. (Flory is sometimes varied with other shapes than the fleur-de-lys, when it is blazoned as &quot;flory of&quot;.)

A vague and unhelpful blazon of the 27th Air Division of the United States Air Force provides for a &quot;bordure of distinctive outline&quot;.

<doc id="369995" wikidata="Q273331" url="?curid=369995" title="Irrawaddy dolphin">
<text>The Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) is a euryhaline species of oceanic dolphin found in scattered subpopulations near sea coasts and in estuaries and rivers in parts of the Bay of Bengal and Southeast Asia. It closely resembles the Australian snubfin dolphin (of the same genus, &quot;Orcaella&quot;), which was not described as a separate species until 2005. It has a slate blue to a slate gray color. Although found in much of the riverine and marine zones of South and Southeast Asia, the only concentrated lagoon populations are found in Chilika Lake in Odisha, India and Songkhla Lake in southern Thailand.

==Taxonomy==

One of the earliest recorded descriptions of the Irrawaddy dolphin was by Sir Richard Owen in 1866 based on a specimen found in 1852, in the harbour of Visakhapatnam on the east coast of India. It is one of two species in its genus. It has sometimes been listed variously in a family containing just itself and in the Monodontidae and Delphinidae. Widespread agreement now exists to list it in the family Delphinidae.

== Etymology ==
The species&#x27; name &quot;brevirostris&quot; is from the Latin meaning short-beaked.

== Description ==

The Irrawaddy dolphin&#x27;s colour is grey to dark slate blue, paler underneath, without a distinctive pattern. The dorsal fin is small and rounded behind the middle of the back. The forehead is high and rounded; the beak is lacking. The front of its snout is blunt. The flippers are broad and rounded. The finless porpoise (&quot;Neophocaena phocaenoides&quot;) is similar and has no back fin; the humpback dolphin (&quot;Sousa chinensis&quot;) is larger, and has a longer beak and a larger dorsal fin.
It ranges in weight from with a length of at full maturity. Maximum recorded length is of a male in Thailand.

The Irrawaddy dolphin is similar to the beluga in appearance, though most closely related to the killer whale. It has a large melon and a blunt, rounded head, and the beak is indistinct. Its dorsal fin, located about two-thirds posterior along the back, is short, blunt, and triangular. Dorsal fin shapes differ from one Irrawaddy dolphin to another. The flippers are long and broad. These dolphins are usually two-toned, with the back and sides being gray to bluish-gray and the belly lighter. Unlike any other dolphin, the Irrawaddy&#x27;s U-shaped blowhole is on the left of the midline and opens towards the front of the dolphin. Its short beak appears very different from those of other dolphins, and its mouth is known for having 12-19 peg-like teeth on each side of the jaws.

==Behaviour==

Communication is carried out with clicks, creaks, and buzzes at a dominant frequency of about 60  kilohertz, which is thought to be used for echolocation. Bony fish and fish eggs, cephalopods, and crustaceans are taken as food. Observations of captive animals indicate food may be taken into the mouth by suction. Irrawaddy dolphins are capable of squirting streams of water that can reach up to ; this distinct behaviour has been known for herding fish into a general area for hunting. They do this sometimes while spyhopping and during feeding, apparently to expel water ingested during fish capture or possibly to herd fish. Some Irrawaddy dolphins kept in captivity have been trained to do spyhopping on command. The Irrawaddy dolphin is a slow swimmer, but swimming speeds of were reported when dolphins were being chased in a boat. In a year, females can sometimes swim as fast as average of 45 km, males can swim up to average of 100 km.

Most Irrawaddy dolphins are shy of boats, not known to bow-ride, and generally dive when alarmed. They are relatively slow moving but can sometimes be seen spyhopping and rolling to one side while waving a flipper and occasionally breaching. They are generally found in groups of 2-3 animals, though sometimes as many as 25 individuals have been known to congregate in deep pools. Groups of fewer than six individuals are most common, but sometimes up to 15 dolphins are seen together. Traveling and staying in groups not only enables Irrawaddy dolphins to hunt, but it also creates and maintains social bonds and allows copulation to occur. There are a few groups of dolphins in Brunei Bay seen near the mouths of Temburong and Aloh Besar rivers which are tame and gather around fisherman boats that catch fish during the fishing season from around December to February.

It surfaces in a rolling fashion and lifts its tail fluke clear of the water only for a deep dive. Deep dive times range from 30 to 150 seconds to 12 minutes. When 277 group dives were timed (time of disappearance of the last dolphin in the group to the emergence of the first dolphin in the group) in Laos, mean duration was 115.3  seconds with a range of 19  seconds to 7.18  minutes.

Interspecific competition has been observed when Irrawaddy dolphins were forced inshore and excluded by more specialized dolphins. When captive humpback dolphins (&quot;Sousa chinensis&quot;) and Irrawaddy dolphins were held together, reportedly the Irrawaddy dolphins were frequently chased and confined to a small portion of the tank by the dominant humpbacks. In Chilika Lake, local fishers say when Irrawaddy dolphins and bottlenose dolphins meet in the outer channel, the former get frightened and are forced to return toward the lake.

===Mating===
A female or male dolphin will attempt to pursue a mate for about a few minutes. They intertwine facing their bellies together and begin to copulate for 40 seconds. Once copulation has occurred, the dolphins will break away from each other and set off in different directions.

===Reproduction===

These dolphins are thought to reach sexual maturity at seven to nine years. In the Northern Hemisphere, mating is reported from December to June. Its gestation period is 14 months; cows give birth to a single calf every two to three years. Length is about at birth. Birth weight is about . Weaning is after two years. Lifespan is about 30 years.

===Feeding===
There are plenty of food items that this dolphin feeds upon. They include fish, crustaceans, and cephalopods. During foraging periods, herds of about 7 dolphins will circle around prey and trap their victim. These prey entrapments occur slightly below the water surface level.

== Habitat and subpopulations ==

Although sometimes called the Irrawaddy river dolphin, it is not a true river dolphin, but an oceanic dolphin that lives in brackish water near coasts, river mouths, and estuaries. It has established subpopulations in freshwater rivers, including the Ganges and the Mekong, as well as the Irrawaddy River from which it takes its name. Its range extends from the Bay of Bengal to New Guinea and the Philippines, although it does not appear to venture off shore. It is often seen in estuaries and bays in Borneo Island, with sightings from Sandakan in Sabah, Malaysia, to most parts of Brunei and Sarawak, Malaysia. A specimen was collected at Mahakam River in East Kalimantan, the local name &quot;pesut mahakam&quot; comes from it.

Presence of the species in Chinese, Taiwanese, and Hong Kong&#x27;s waters has been questioned as the reported sightings have been considered unreliable, and the easternmost of ranges along Eurasian continent is in Vietnam.

No range-wide survey has been conducted for this vulnerable species; however, the worldwide population appears to be over 7,000. In India, Irawaddy dolphins are mostly found in Chilika Lake. Known subpopulations of Irrawaddy dolphins are found in eight places, listed here in order of population, including conservation status.

# Bangladesh: ~3500 (VU) in coastal waters of the Bay of Bengal and 451 (VU) in the brackish Sundarbans mangrove forest
# India: 156 (VU) in the brackish-water Chilika Lake, Odisha. Presence recorded from Sundarbans National Park, West Bengal also.
# Cambodia: ~105 (CR) in a 190-km (118-mi) freshwater stretch of the Mekong River (extinct in Laos since 2022)
# Indonesia: ~70 (CR), in a 420-km (260-mi) stretch of the freshwater Mahakam River
# Philippines: ~42 (CR) in the brackish inner Malampaya Sound. Researchers are studying the recent discovery of 30-40 dolphins sighted in the waters of Pulupandan and Bago, Negros Occidental, in Western Visayas.
# Myanmar (Burma): ~58-72 (CR) in a 370-km (230-mi) freshwater stretch of the Ayeyarwady River
# Thailand: less than 50 (CR) in the brackish Songkhla Lake, perhaps just 14.

==Interaction with humans==
Irrawaddy dolphins have a mutualistic relationship of co-operative fishing with traditional fishers. Fishers in India recall when they would call out to the dolphins, by tapping a wooden key also known as a &quot;lahai kway&quot;, against the sides of their boats, asking the Irrawaddys to drive fish into their nets. In Burma, in the upper reaches of the Ayeyarwady River, Irrawaddy dolphins drive fish towards fishers using cast nets in response to acoustic signals from them. The fishermen attempt to gain the attention of the dolphins through various efforts such as using a cone-shaped wooden stick to drum the side of their canoes, striking their paddles to the surface of the water, jingling their nets, or making calls that sound turkey-like. A pod of dolphins that agrees to work alongside the fisherman will entrap a school of fish in a semicircle, guiding them towards the boat. In return, the dolphins are rewarded with some of the fishers&#x27; bycatch. Historically, Irrawaddy River fishers claimed particular dolphins were associated with individual fishing villages and chased fish into their nets. An 1879 report indicated legal claims were frequently brought into native courts by fishers to recover a share of the fish from the nets of a rival fisher that the plaintiff&#x27;s dolphin was claimed to have helped fill.

=== Folk stories ===
Laotians and Cambodians have a common belief that the Irrawaddy dolphins are reincarnations of their ancestors. Some even claim that the dolphins have saved drowning villagers and protected people from attacks by crocodiles. Their beliefs and experiences have led the people of Laos and Cambodia to live peacefully alongside one another for ages. The West Kalimantan people have a similar story where the dolphins were naughty children that ate a pot of rice reserved for the shaman, but their mouths scalded and jumped into the water to cool themselves, but later transformed into these dolphins. 

Buddhist Khmer and Vietnamese fishermen have regarded the &quot;Orcaella&quot; as a sacred animal. If caught in fishing nets, they release the dolphin from the rest of the catch. In contrast, Muslim Khmer fisherman kill them for food. This has led to the dolphin becoming reputed to recognize the local languages of the area and it approaching areas of the Khmer Muslim community with caution.

==Threats==

Irrawaddy dolphins are more susceptible to human conflict than most other dolphins that live farther out in the ocean. Drowning in gillnets is the main threat to them throughout their range. Between 1995 and 2001, 38 deaths were reported and 74% died as a result of entanglement in gillnets with large mesh sizes. The majority of reported dolphin deaths in all subpopulations is due to accidental capture and drowning in gillnets and dragnets, and in the Philippines, bottom-set crabnets. In Burma, electrofishing, gold mining, and dam building are also serious and continuing threats. Though most fishers are sympathetic to the dolphins&#x27; plight, abandoning their traditional livelihood is difficult for them.

Another identified threat towards the Irrawaddy dolphins was noise pollution from high-speed vessels. This caused the dolphins to dive significantly longer than usual. The Irrawaddy dolphins always changed directions when they encountered these large vessels.

In recent years, Laotians and Cambodians developed techniques of using explosives for fishing. The government of Laos has made use of such tactics illegal, but few regulations have been made in neighboring Cambodia, where explosives are sold in local markets and the practice of using fishnets has been abandoned. The practice of using explosives instead has become very popular and led to a steady decline of populations of fish, and especially the dolphins swimming in the area. Although Laotians may not use explosives, they do use nylon gillnets, which pose another large threat to the survival of the Irrawaddy. Some dolphins accidentally become entangled in the net. Poor fishermen refuse to cut and destroy their nets because it would result in too great of an economic loss to save one Irrawaddy dolphin.

In Laos, a dam across the Mekong River is planned. This could threaten the existence of the endangered Irrawaddy dolphins in downstream Cambodia. Laos&#x27;s government decision is to forge the dam upstream of the core habitat of the Irrawaddy dolphins. This could precipitate the extinction of this specific species in the Mekong River. The dam builders&#x27; proposal is to use explosives to dig out the tons of rock. This will create strong sound waves that could possibly kill the Irrawaddy dolphins due to their highly sensitive hearing structures.

In several Asian countries, Irrawaddy dolphins have been captured and trained to perform in public aquaria. Their charismatic appearance and unique behaviors, including spitting water, spyhopping, and fluke-slapping, make them very popular for shows in dolphinaria. The commercial motivation for using this dolphin species is high because it can live in freshwater tanks and the high cost of marine aquarium systems is avoided. The region within and near the species&#x27; range has developed economically; theme parks, casinos, and other entertainment venues that include dolphin shows have increased.

In 2002, there were more than 80 dolphinariums in at least nine Asian countries.

Collateral deaths of dolphins due to blast fishing were once common in Vietnam and Thailand. In the past, the most direct threat was killing them for their oil.

The IUCN lists five of the seven subpopulations as endangered, primarily due to drowning in fish nets. For example, the Malampaya population, first discovered and described in 1986, at the time consisted of 77 individuals. Due to anthropogenic activities, this number dwindled to 47 dolphins in 2007. In the Mahakam River in Borneo, 73% of dolphin deaths are related to entanglement in gillnets, due to heavy fishing and boat traffic.

===Tourism===
The Irrawaddy dolphins in Asia are increasingly threatened by tourist activity, such as large numbers of boats circulating the areas in which they live. The development of tours and boats has put a large strain on the dolphins.

===Disease===
Cutaneous nodules were found present in various vulnerable populations of Irrawaddy dolphins. A more precise estimate of the affected dolphins is six populations. Although the definite fate of this emergent disease is unknown, the species is at risk.

==Conservation==

The Irrawaddy dolphin&#x27;s proximity to developing communities makes the effort for conservation difficult. Entanglement in fishnets and degradation of habitats are the main threats to Irrawaddy dolphins. Conservation efforts are being made at international and national levels to alleviate these threats.

===International efforts===
Protection from international trade is provided by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Enforcement, though, is the responsibility of individual countries. While some international trade for dolphinarium animals may have occurred, this is unlikely to have ever been a major threat to the species.

Some Irrawaddy dolphin populations are classified by the IUCN as critically endangered; in Cambodia, Vietnam (Mekong River sub-population), Indonesia (Mahakam River sub-population, Borneo), Myanmar (Ayeyarwady/Irrawaddy River sub-population), the Philippines (Malampaya Sound sub-population), and Thailand (Songkhla Lake sub-population). Irrawaddy dolphins in general however, are IUCN listed as an Endangered species, which applies throughout their whole range. In 2004, CITES transferred the Irrawaddy dolphin from Appendix II to Appendix I, which forbids all commercial trade in species that are threatened with extinction.

The UNEP-CMS Action Plan for the Conservation of Freshwater Populations of Irrawaddy dolphins notes that multiple-use protected areas will play a key role for conserving freshwater populations. Protected areas in fresh water could be a particularly effective conservation tool and can facilitate management, due to the fidelity of the species to relatively circumscribed areas. The Action Plan provides details on strategies for mitigating by-catch that includes:
:-establishing core conservation areas where gillnetting is banned or severely restricted
:-promoting net attendance rules and providing training on the safe release of entangled dolphins
:-initiating programs to compensate fishers for damage caused to their nets by entangled dolphins that are safely released
:-providing alternative or diversified employment options for gillnet fishers
:-encouraging the use of fishing gear that does not harm dolphins, by altering or establishing fee structures for fishing permits to make gillnetting more expensive while decreasing the fees for nondestructive gear
:-experimenting with acoustical deterrents and reflective nets.

The Irrawaddy dolphin is listed on both Appendix I and Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). It is listed on Appendix I as this species has been categorized as being in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant proportion of their range and CMS Parties strive towards strictly protecting these animals, conserving or restoring the places where they live, mitigating obstacles to migration and controlling other factors that might endanger them, as well on Appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organized by tailored agreements.

The species is also covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (MoU).

===National efforts===
Several national efforts are resulting in the reduction of threats to local Irrawaddy dolphin subpopulations:

==== Bangladesh ====

Portions of Irrawaddy dolphin habitat in the Sundarbans mangrove forest of Bangladesh are included within of three wildlife sanctuaries, which are part of the Sunderbans World Heritage Site. The Wildlife Conservation Society is working with the Bangladesh Ministry of Environment and Forests to create protected areas for the 6000 remaining dolphins

==== Cambodia ====
Irrawaddy dolphins are fully protected as an endangered species under Cambodian fishery law. In 2005, The World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF) established the Cambodian Mekong Dolphin Conservation Project with support from government and local communities. The aim is to support the survival of the remaining population through targeted conservation activities, research, and education. In January 2012, the Cambodian Fisheries Administration, the Commission for Conservation and Development of Mekong River Dolphin Eco-tourism Zone, and WWF signed the Kratie Declaration on the Conservation of the Mekong River Irrawaddy Dolphin, an agreement binding them to work together, and setting out a roadmap for dolphin conservation in the Mekong River. On 24 August 2012, the Cambodian government announced that stretch of the Mekong River from eastern Kratie province to the border with Laos has been stated as limit fishing zone which uses floating houses, fishing cages and gill nets are disallowed, but simple fishing is allowed. This area is patrolled by a network of river guards, specifically to protect dolphins. Between January and February 2006, a dozen Irrawaddy dolphins were found dead. The discovery of 10 new baby dolphins on the coast of Cambodia was a relief and gave hope that the endangered Irrawaddy dolphins would make a comeback in population. Since the endangerment was evident, 66 guards have been posted on the coast of Cambodia to protect these dolphins, and only two deaths have been reported since these efforts. To make more efforts to keep these animals from going extinct, the use of fishing nets on the coast of Cambodia is banned, as well.
==== India ====
The Irrawaddy dolphin (under the common name of snubfin dolphin, with the scientific name misspelled as &quot;Oreaella brevezastris&quot;) is included the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, Schedule I, which bans their killing, transport and sale of products. A major restoration effort to open a new mouth between Chilika Lake and the Bay of Bengal in 2000 was successful in restoring the lake ecology and regulating the salinity gradient in the lake waters, which has resulted in increases in the population of Irrawaddy dolphin due to increase of prey species of fish, prawns, and crabs.

==== Indonesia ====
A conservation program, entitled Conservation Foundation for the Protection of Rare Aquatic Species of Indonesia, focused on protecting the Irrawaddy dolphin population and their habitat, the Mahakam River. The program not only educates and surveys the public, but also monitors the dolphin population and their habitat. A prime example of this is the establishment of patrols in several villages.

==== Laos ====
The dolphins have been excinct in Laos since 2022. In the 1970s, many Irrawaddy dolphins were slaughtered for oil, and soon after, intensive fishing practices with explosives and gillnets began. The dolphins were protected in Cambodia and Laos and explosive fishing and use of gillnets were restricted in many of the Irrawaddy dolphin&#x27;s habitats. Canadian conservationist Ian Baird set up the Lao Community Fisheries and Dolphin Protection Project to study the Irrawaddy dolphins in the Laotian part of the Mekong. Part of this project compensated fishers for the loss of nets damaged to free entangled dolphins. This project was expanded to include Cambodia, after the majority of the dolphin population was determined to have been killed or migrated to Cambodia. The Si Phan Don Wetlands Project encouraged river communities to set aside conservation zones and establish laws to regulate how and when fish are caught. 

Ultimately, these measures were unsuccessful. In early 2022, a 110kg 25 year old male dolphin was found dead on an island in the Si Phan Don called Koh La Ngo. It measured 2.6m in length and was the last Irrawaddy dolphin in Laos.

==== Myanmar ====
Myanmar&#x27;s Department of Fisheries took charge in December 2005, and instituted a protected region in a segment of the Ayeyarwady River between Mingun and Kyaukmyaung. Protective measures in the area include mandatory release of entangled dolphins, prohibition of the catching or killing of dolphins and trade in whole or parts of them, and the prohibition of electrofishing and gillnets more than long, or spaced less than apart. Mercury poisoning and habitat loss from gold-mining dredging operations in the river have been eliminated.

==== Philippines ====
In 2000, Malampaya Sound was proclaimed a protected seascape. This is the lowest possible prioritization given to a protected area. Malampaya Sound Ecological Studies Project was initiated by the WWF. With technical support provided by the project, the municipality of Taytay and the Malampaya park management developed fishery policies to minimize the threats to the Irrawaddy dolphin from bycatch capture. Gear studies and gear modification to conserve the dolphin species were implemented. The project was completed in 2007.
In 2007, the Coral Triangle Initiative, a new multilateral partnership to help safeguard the marine and coastal resources of the Coral Triangle, including the Irrawaddy dolphin subpopulation in Malampaya Sound, was launched. In 2006, a new population was discovered in Guimaras island in the Visayas. In 2015, another new population was discovered in Bago and Pulupandan in Negros Occidental, part of Negros island in the Visayas. The doplphins are locally known in the Visayas as &quot;lumba-lumba&quot;.
==== Thailand ====
In 2002, the Marine and Coastal Resources Department was assigned to protect rare aquatic animals such as dolphins, whales, and turtles in Thai territorial waters. To protect the dolphins, patrol vessels ensure boats stay at least away from dolphins and no chasing of or running through schools of dolphins occurs. Many fishermen on the Bang Pakong River, Prachinburi Province, have been persuaded by authorities to stop shrimp fishing in a certain area and 30 to 40 fishing boats have been modified so they can offer dolphin sightseeing tours.
A total of 65 Irrawaddy dolphins has been found dead along the coast of Trat Province in the past three years. The local fishing industry is blamed for the deaths of the dolphins. In January 2013, over a dozen dead Irrawaddy dolphins were found on the coast of Thailand. These dolphins were said to be dead because of a lack of oxygen. Dolphins are mammals, and unlike other animals that live in the sea, they must come to the surface for air. Many of the dolphins are found dead in the water, and others were washed ashore, said to have been dead for a few days. Also, in the first week of February 2013, as many as four Irrawaddy dolphins were found dead. The Natural Resources and Environment Ministry is studying artificial breeding options in 2022 to try to save the last herd of Irrawaddy dolphins in Songkhla Lake, which is on the verge of extinction after only 14 were found in the most recent survey. They also intend to list dolphins as a protected species, Thailand&#x27;s highest level of animal protection.

==== Malaysia ====
In 2008, the Department of Forestry and Sarawak Forestry Cooperative in Sarawak established a protected area for Irrawaddy dolphins in Santubong and Damai (Kuching Wetland). Furthermore, they plan to establish more beaches in Miri as protected areas for them. The protection measures in the area include prohibition of catching or killing of dolphins and trade in whole or parts of them, and prohibiting the use of gillnets. The government may also start small- and medium-scale research of this species at Sarawak Malaysia University with sponsorship from Sarawak Shell.

==== Vietnam ====
In 2012 in Vietnam, a group of scientists took in four Irrawaddy dolphins and provided them with medical care to see how they would survive. However, they found this to be the first case they saw of Irrawaddy dolphins having bacterial infections. The bacterial infection, chorioamnionitis, is common in many marine animals, but when these few dolphins were taken in, the scientists discovered this same bacterial infection for the first time in this group of dolphins. This disease mostly affects animals that are pregnant because the infection occurs through the umbilical cord and goes into the maternal bloodstream. One of the dolphins was pregnant and before her death was found circling around the bottom of the pool and was found dead early the next morning. This bacterial infection affects many organs in the body of the animal.

<doc id="370005" wikidata="Q2604192" url="?curid=370005" title="K-9 and Company">
<text>K-9 and Company is a one-episode television pilot, for a proposed 1981 television spin-off of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. It features former series regulars Sarah Jane Smith, an investigative journalist played by Elisabeth Sladen, and K9, a robotic dog voiced by John Leeson. Both characters had been companions of the Fourth Doctor, but they had not appeared together before. The single episode, &quot;A Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;, was broadcast by BBC1 as a Christmas special on 28 December 1981, but was not taken up for a continuing series.

&quot;A Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; is set in the fictional English village of Moreton Harwood in 1981. In the programme, Sarah and K9 investigate the disappearance of Brendan Richards (Ian Sears), the ward of Sarah&#x27;s Aunt Lavinia (Mary Wimbush), in the wake of increasing reports of witchcraft.

Under a different production team, the overall concept of a Sarah Jane and K9 series did eventually come to fruition: &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; (2007–2011), featuring both of these key characters and actors (though K9 and Leeson only appear in some episodes).

==Programme origins==
The programme has its roots firmly in the desire of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; producer John Nathan-Turner to get Elisabeth Sladen back into the TARDIS. He wanted her to have the contract that was eventually awarded to Janet Fielding in late 1980. Nathan-Turner&#x27;s preferred plan for the transition from Baker to Davison was to have Sarah Jane be along for the ride from &quot;Logopolis&quot; to the second story of series 19. However, Sladen had no interest in returning simply to reprise a role and function identical to the one she had left years before.

Meanwhile, Nathan-Turner was trying to figure out what to do about K9. The robot dog was very popular among children but was difficult to deal with technically and Nathan-Turner felt that it made the TARDIS crew almost overwhelmingly formidable. He decided that a child-orientated spin-off series with K9 might be just the thing. However, such a series would require a human as the lead, and his prime candidate for this role was Sladen. He pitched the part to the actress as a departure from what she had previously done: she would be returning as Sarah Jane Smith, but she would do so as the heroine and not just a sidekick. This offer Sladen accepted.

==&quot;A Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot;==
===Plot===
Sarah Jane Smith visits her Aunt Lavinia, who was occasionally mentioned but never seen in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. When she arrives at her aunt&#x27;s house, though, she finds that her learned relative has left early for a lecture tour in America, Christmas notwithstanding. Sarah is thus left disappointed by the prospect of another holiday without family. Lavinia&#x27;s ward, Brendan Richards, breaks her moment of reflection on her aunt&#x27;s sudden disappearance. After picking him up from the railway station, they return to the house and discover a large crate that has been waiting for Sarah for a number of years. When they open it, they discover a mechanical dog named K9. Upon activation, it tells Sarah that it is a gift from the Doctor.

Brendan&#x27;s curiosity about K9 is matched only by Sarah&#x27;s renewed concern over Lavinia&#x27;s absence. They thus split up and follow their new-found obsessions. Sarah goes into town to question the locals, and Brendan stays behind to test the capabilities of Sarah&#x27;s new &quot;pet&quot;. In town, Sarah discovers that Lavinia has become disliked by some because of her blunt letters to the local newspaper editors about a growing practice of witchcraft in the area. Brendan, meanwhile, is attacked while using K9 to analyse soil samples in Lavinia&#x27;s garden. His attackers, George Tracey and his son, Peter, are tied into the local coven. George Tracey flees before Brendan can get a good look at him, however K9 uses his laser gun to stun Peter before setting off in pursuit of George. Peter is pinioned and interrogated by Brendan, but makes his escape when Brendan goes outside to investigate a crashing sound which turns out to be the accidental destruction of a greenhouse by K9 in his pursuit of the elder Tracey.

Since Tracey is actually Lavinia&#x27;s gardener, he is naturally called in the next morning to investigate the damage K9&#x27;s pursuit of him caused to the greenhouse. After Brendan attempts to brag about the pH balance of the soil, Tracey sharply comments that gardening is more about respect for nature than scientific theory. Otherwise, though, he doesn&#x27;t betray his more sinister intent towards Brendan. Later that night, he sends his son out to kidnap the sleeping Brendan from the house.

This time, Brendan&#x27;s attacker is successful, stealing him out from under Sarah, who is elsewhere in the house, reading up on the local practice of witchcraft.

Sarah is now increasingly suspicious of Tracey, believing he would have the opportunity to commit the crime, even if she can&#x27;t yet put her finger on the motive. She therefore finds a way to hide K9 in Tracey&#x27;s house. K9 quietly monitors the household, until he eventually listens in on a conversation that implicates Tracey as a member of a coven. He also discovers that Tracey intends to kill Brendan in an act of ritual murder.

When Tracey leaves his cottage, Sarah is able to retrieve K9, who alerts his new mistress to the impending crime. She has no way to enlist the aid of the local police or, really anyone else in the town, because she can&#x27;t substantiate her claim of overhearing the conversation without also then having to explain who and what the anachronistic K9 actually is.

Realising that she and K9 are effectively on their own, she tries to figure out how to stop the sacrifice. Her first order of business is determining the &quot;when&quot; of it. Using Lavinia&#x27;s books on witchcraft, she and K9 deduce it must occur at midnight on the winter solstice, now just a few short hours away. The &quot;where&quot; of it is more elusive, however, causing the duo to drive around the shire looking at all the churches. As the last few minutes before midnight tick away, they finally realise that there&#x27;s an abandoned chapel on Lavinia&#x27;s property. Rushing home, K9 and Sarah are briefly upset at missing something that was right under their noses all along.

They arrive just in time for K9 to use his blaster to stop the coven&#x27;s Priest and Priestess from plunging a knife into Brendan&#x27;s chest. Now stunned, the group&#x27;s ringleaders are easily apprehended by the police.

Finally able to celebrate Christmas, Sarah receives a call from her Aunt Lavinia. She&#x27;s surprised that Sarah was worried about her, since she left instructions for her business partner to send Sarah a cable. As he turned out to be the High Priest of the coven, Sarah merely laughs and tells her aunt that she has a story to tell her about why that message never reached her. Meanwhile, K9 tries to connect with the human holiday in his own way, teaching himself to sing &quot;We Wish You a Merry Christmas&quot;.

==Production==

===Cast notes===
Bill Fraser previously appeared with Tom Baker and K9 Mark II in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;Meglos&quot; in 1980 and Colin Jeavons played Damon in the Patrick Troughton serial &quot;The Underwater Menace&quot; in 1967.

===Theme music===
&quot;A Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; featured electronic theme music, composed by Ian Levine and Fiachra Trench. The music was intended to be an orchestral score, but was instead arranged directly from an electronic demonstration arrangement by Peter Howell (who also arranged the 1980s version of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; theme music).

===Broadcast and production===
The viewing figures for the pilot were strong, achieving a viewership of about 8.4 million Britons on its première. This meant that it attracted more viewers than the average episode of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; during John Nathan-Turner&#x27;s era as producer. 

Despite these above-average ratings, the show did not go to series. The proximate cause for this was a changeover in channel controllers at BBC One; Bill Cotton, who had approved the pilot, vacated his position soon thereafter. He was replaced by Alan Hart, who simply disliked the idea and the resulting product. Further episodes were therefore not commissioned. The show was repeated on BBC2 on 24 December 1982.

==Reception==
The pilot attracted 8.4 million viewers on its original broadcast.

51.55% of &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; readers participaing in &quot;The Mighty 200&quot; poll liked &quot;K-9 and Company&quot;. The title sequence came first in TV&#x27;s Top 5 worst title sequences as part of David Walliams&#x27; &quot;Awfully Good TV&quot;.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===
A novelisation of &quot;A Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; was released under the title &quot;K-9 and Company&quot;, in October 1987, as the last of &quot;The Companions of Doctor Who&quot; series by Target Books.
===Home media===
&quot;K-9 and Company&quot; was originally released on VHS on 7 August 1995 by BBC Worldwide. It was then released onto DVD 16 June 2008 as a double pack with K-9&#x27;s first Doctor Who story &quot;The Invisible Enemy&quot; by 2entertain.

&quot;K-9 and Company&quot; was re-released on DVD by 2entertain on 25 October 2010.

It was included in the &quot;Doctor Who: The Collection&quot; Season 18 Blu-ray set, as an extra remastered to HD. It is also available for streaming, along with other vintage episodes of &quot;Doctor Who,&quot; on the streaming service BritBox and on BBC iPlayer in the UK.

<doc id="370007" wikidata="Q828417" url="?curid=370007" title="Old Rauma">
<text>Old Rauma (, ) is the wooden centre of the town of Rauma, Finland. It was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1991 because of its unique wooden architecture and its well-preserved medieval town layout. It is one of the only medieval towns in Finland.

The area of Old Rauma is about 0.3 km2, with approximately six hundred buildings (counting both proper houses and smaller buildings like sheds) and about 800 people living in the area. The oldest buildings date from the 18th century, as two fires in 1640 and 1682 destroyed much of the town. However, the layout of the town center still retains much of its medieval structure. The wooden buildings are almost exclusively one story, although several older buildings also have cellars. The residential buildings are located along the main street, whereas the ancillary buildings (for example, grain houses and sheds) were constructed along narrow alleyways. Most buildings are currently inhabited and owned by private individuals, although along the two main streets and around the town square they are mainly outside in business use. In the 18th century, the town of Rauma expanded outside the Old Rauma proper, and the increased ship trading led to the modernization of the city.

Although Old Rauma was almost completely destroyed by fires, a few buildings and ruins survive from medieval times. The Church of the Holy Cross, a Franciscan monastery church inaugurated in 1512, contains several medieval paintings and is one of the main attractions in Old Rauma. Another church in Old Rauma, the Church of the Holy Trinity, also from the 15th century, burned in the fire of 1640. The only other ancient stone building is the Old Town Hall, which was constructed in 1776.

Other locations of special interest include the &quot;Kirsti&quot; house, which is a seaman&#x27;s house from the 18th and 19th centuries, and the &quot;Marela&quot; house, which is a shipowner&#x27;s house dating to the 18th century but with a 19th-century facade, both of which are currently museums.

<text>Nyckelharpa, Swedish for &#x27;key-harp()&#x27;, meaning roughly &quot;keyed fiddle&quot; (, plural , compare tagelharpa), is a &quot;keyed&quot; bowed chordophone, primarily originating from Sweden in its modern form, but with its roots in medieval Europe. It is similar in appearance to a fiddle or violin but larger (in its earlier forms essentially a modified vielle), which employs key-actuated tangents along the neck to change the pitch during play, much like a hurdy-gurdy. The keys slide under the strings, with the tangents set perpendicularly to the keys, reaching above the strings. Upon key-actuation, the tangent is pressed to meet the corresponding string, much like a fret, shortening its vibrating length to that point, changing the pitch of the string.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyckelharpa.org/about&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is primarily played underarm, suspended from the shoulder using a sling, with the bow in the overhanging arm.

The origin of the instrument is unknown, but its historical foothold and modern development is much larger in Sweden than other countries. Many of the early historical depictions of the instrument are found in Sweden, the earliest possibly depiction found on a relief located on a 14th century church portal. While historically not too common an instrument in Sweden (relatively speaking), the violin outshining it in usage among spelmän (players of Swedish folk music), the nyckelharpa became a popular folk instrument in the Swedish province of Uppland during the 17th century, subsequently leading to its popularization and spread throughout Sweden the following centuries. By the 19th century it had become a &quot;fine&quot; instrument, being played at concerts in Stockholm, and by the early 20th century it had become an archetypal instrument alongside the violin for Swedish folk music. Today it is considered by many to be the quintessential national instrument of Sweden. The oldest surviving nyckelharpa is dated 1526 and is part of the Zorn Collections in Mora Municipality, Sweden.&lt;ref name=&quot;Motion 2001/02:Kr353&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides Sweden, early depictions of nyckelharpor can also be found in Denmark, Germany and Italy, among other European countries. The earliest of these is found in a 1408 fresco by Taddeo di Bartolo at the Palazzo Pubblico chapel in Siena, Italy, which depicts an angel playing a &quot;keyed viola&quot;. Recently there has been a push by luthiers and the like to make recreations of these older depictions of nyckelharpor, akin to reconstructional archaeology, but also new instruments based on the nyckelharpa concept of a keyed bow instrument.

== History ==
=== 1000s–1200s (first keyed instruments) ===
Development of keyed string instruments appears to have started during the High Middle Ages, with instruments such as the duo-played organistrum (a hurdy-gurdy), starting in the late 900s or early 1000s. Such were popular in Southwestern Europe and eventually evolved into the solo-played &quot;symphonia&quot;-hurdy-gurdy in France or Spain in the 1200s, featuring diatonic tangents. Somewhere along the line, it appears the keyed section of a &quot;hurdy-gurdy&quot; was integrated onto a bowed string instrument, producing the first keyed fiddle or proto-nyckelharpa instrument. It is unclear where the instrument first appeared, but the spread of hurdy-gurdy and bowed string instruments in Europe during the later Middle Ages makes it possible that the instrument was invented independently by several people.

=== 1300s–1500s (first keyed vielles) ===

The earliest possible depiction of nyckelharpor known, or rather &quot;keyed vielles&quot; by appearance, can be found in a relief on one of the portals to the Källunge Church, located on the Swedish island of Gotland. Dating from circa 1350, it depicts two musicians with bow stringed instruments suspiciously looking like nyckelharpor, appearing to have keyboxes (a cover above the strings) like a hurdy-gurdy. The relief is however eroded and damaged from time, making it hard to confirm them as nyckelharpor.
The earliest confirmed depiction of a nyckelharpa appears in an Italian church painting found in Siena, Italy, dating to 1408. It depicts an angel playing a vielle-looking nyckelharpa (a common nyckelharpa motif for the period), featuring five keyes and a keybox above the strings.

Throughout the 15th century, more depictions of nyckelharpor start appearing in church paintings, notably in Swedish and Danish churches, such as the Emmislöv Church, which has a painting of a nyckelharpa musician dating to 1450–1475. Others include the Tolfta Church in Sweden, which has two paintings of angels playing nyckelharpa, dating to . Interestingly, most, if not all, Swedish nyckelharpa depictions on church paintings, lack keyboxes. Early Danish nyckelharpa depictions, such as the ones found in the Rynkeby Church, dated to ca. 1560, all feature keyboxes.

The earliest known recorded name for nyckelharpor can be found in an early German music dictionary () by Martin Agricola, dating to 1529. There it is called a (&quot;key vielle&quot;). The corresponding image features a keybox on the instrument.

=== 1600s–1800s (early modern period) ===
The german term, &quot;Schlüsselfidel&quot;, is mentioned in , a famous work written in 1620 by the German organist Michael Praetorius (1571–1621). At this time the nyckelharpa was not too common of an instrument in Sweden, the violin outshining it in Swedish folk music use.

Starting from the early 17th century, however, the nyckelharpa got a foothold as a popular folk instrument among spelmän (players of Swedish folk music) in the Swedish province of Uppland, which came to be the stronghold for nyckelharpa music the following centuries, including musicians like (Carl Ersson Bössa, 1783–1847) from Älvkarleby. From Uppland, the popularization of the instrument spread to the neighbouring provinces and eventually throughout Sweden. By the 19th century it had become a &quot;fine&quot; instrument which came to be played at concerts in Stockholm.

=== 1900s–onward (modern period) ===
The popularization of the nyckelharpa continued and by the early 20th century it had become an archetypal instrument for Swedish folk music, equivalent to the violin. From this point the instrument would see a wide range of developments to make it a more modern instrument for a modern audience.

Changes by August Bohlin (1877–1949) in 1929/1930 made the nyckelharpa a chromatic instrument with a straight bow, making it a more violin-like and no longer a bourdon instrument. Composer, player and maker of nyckelharpor Eric Sahlström (1912–1986) used this new instrument and helped to re-popularize it in the mid-20th century. In spite of this, the nyckelharpa&#x27;s popularity declined until the 1960s roots revival.

The 1960s and 1970s saw a resurgence in the popularity of the nyckelharpa, with notable artists such as Marco Ambrosini (Italy and Germany), Sture Sahlström, Gille, Peter Puma Hedlund and Nils Nordström including the nyckelharpa in both early music and contemporary music offerings. Continued refinement of the instrument also contributed to the increase in popularity, with instrument builders like Jean-Claude Condi and Annette Osann bringing innovation to the bow and body.

In 1990s, the nyckelharpa was recognised as one of the instruments available for study at the folk music department of the Royal College of Music in Stockholm (Kungliga Musikhögskolan). It has also been a prominent part of several revival groups in the later part of the century, including the trio Väsen, the more contemporary group Hedningarna, the Finnish folk music group Hyperborea and the Swedish folk music groups Dråm and Nordman. It has also been used in non-Scandinavian musical contexts, for example by the Spanish player Ana Alcaide, the English singer and multi-instrumentalist Anna Tam, and Sandra Schmitt of Storm Seeker, a pirate metal band from Germany.

The first World Nyckelharpa Day took place on 26 April 2020 just as the world had gone into lockdown. All the events took place online, either as livestreams or pre-recorded videos on Youtube. This now is a yearly event taking place on the Sunday closest to 26 April – this being the birthday of the great nyckelharpa player Byss-Calle. The event is co-ordinated by British/Swedish nyckelharpa player Vicki Swan.

English composer Natalie Holt used nyckelharpa for background score of the Disney+ series &quot;Loki&quot; from 2021.

Eurovision Song Contest 1995 winner Norway&#x27;s song &quot;Nocturne&quot; (Secret Garden Group) used this instrument in their performance.

== Reconstructional archaeology ==
In the 21st century there has been a growing interest among enthusiast to resurrect the early historical nyckelharpa designs. This has led to countless recreations of preserved historical copies, such as the moraharpa and esseharpa, among others, but also a push to recreate nyckelharpa-designs only found in historical paintings, such as the one depicted in Siena, Italy. Such projects can be seen as reconstructional archaeology, although reproductions are not always 1–1 clones of what is depicted in the old paintings.

The nyckelharpa depicted in Siena, Italy, has been dubbed &quot;viola a chiavi di Siena&quot; (Italian for &quot;Sienan keyed viola&quot;), or simply &quot;Siena-Harpa&quot; (also styled &quot;Sienaharpa&quot;) for short, relating to the Swedish naming-theme (&quot;Siena harp&quot;), and such a reconstruction was produced as part of an international research project around 2020, built by professional luthier Alexander Pilz, a seasoned maker of nyckelharpor working out of Leipzig, Germany. The popularisation of the Italian design has led other luthiers in recent years to produce reproductions of the depiction as well.

== Technique ==

The nyckelharpa is usually played with a strap around the neck, stabilised by the right arm. Didier François, a violinist and nyckelharpist from Belgium, is noted for using an unusual playing posture, holding the nyckelharpa vertically in front of the chest. This allows a wider range of motion for both arms. It also affects the tone and sound of the instrument.

Some players may use a violin bracket to keep the nyckelharpa away from the body so that it can swing freely, causing it to sound more &quot;open&quot; as its resonance is not damped.

Each nyckelharpa string is either a melody string, drone, or (in some instruments) resonance string. Melody strings are stopped using the keys, so different notes can be played when the string is bowed, depending on which key is depressed. Each key specifically stops one melody string. Drone strings are bowed but not stopped, so only one note can be played with them. Resonance strings are neither bowed nor stopped. They add to the timbre of the instrument by resonating in sympathy when the same note is played by bowing another string.

== Variants ==
There are several variants of the nyckelharpa being produced and played today, differing in the number and arrangement of keys, number and arrangement of strings, and general body shape. They can be divided into types &quot;with resonance strings&quot; and types &quot;without resonance strings&quot;. There are also a variety of derivatives which belongs to the &quot;keyed bowed chordophone-family&quot; but do not necessarily have to be classified as nyckelharpor.

Listed types below refer to Swedish/Nordic types as &quot;variants&quot;, with other types being referred to as &quot;derivatives&quot;.

=== Variants with resonance strings ===
The most common types of nyckelharpor are distinguished by having resonance strings. They can be divided into several subvariants, but the four main variants are as follows:

*Kromatisk nyckelharpa (&quot;chromatic key harp&quot;) – most predominant type of nyckelharpa. The three-row so-called &quot;chromatic nyckelharpa&quot;, with three melody strings tuned A1 – C1 – G, one drone tuned at C (from the highest to the lowest string) that is only touched occasionally, and 12 resonance strings (one for each step of the chromatic scale).
*Kontrabasharpa (&quot;double bass harp&quot;) – most popular during the 17th and 18th centuries. Typically the top has a high arch, and there are two oval-shaped soundholes in the lower bout called &quot;oxögon&quot;. The name &quot;Kontrabasharpa&quot; refers not to the pitch being any deeper than a standard nyckelharpa&#x27;s (it isn&#x27;t), but to the unstopped drone string which always resonates below the melody strings during regular play. The two melody strings are set up on either side of the drone string, such that melodies can be played as double stops between a single melody string and the open drone string without the two melody strings ever clashing.
*Silverbasharpa (&quot;silver base harp&quot;) – most popular in the 19th and early 20th centuries, so named because of the bass strings which are traditionally wound with silver. It is the immediate predecessor to the modern nyckelharpa, and the string configuration is identical, however it retains the older top with a more pronounced arch as well as the two &quot;oxögon&quot;. The main difference is that only the top two strings are stopped, meaning that the bottom C and G strings cannot play any other notes, and so nearly all of its repertoire is in the key of C. In addition, some silverbasharpor may be diatonic and not chromatic, and some keys may stop both melody strings at once.
*Oktavharpa (&quot;octave harp&quot;) – invented by Lennart and Johan Hedin in 1996. It is essentially a modern three-row nyckelharpa tuned an octave down, almost identical to a cello. It is the lowest-pitched variant of the nyckelharpa.

The resonance strings, or sympathetic strings, which were added to the instrument during the 2nd half of the 16th century, are not bowed directly but resonate with the other strings. There can be anywhere from six to twelve of them, depending on the construction and tonality of the instrument. Some modern nyckelharpor have been made with four or even five rows of keys, however they have not been popular enough to replace the three-row nyckelharpa as the standard.

=== Variants without resonance strings ===
Beyond the common variants with resonance strings, there are a variety of nyckelharpa designs without such. Some of examples include:

*Moraharpa (&quot;Mora harp&quot;) – is the most common nyckelharpa derivative, based on a unique nyckelharpa found in the Swedish town of Mora Municipality, Sweden, dating to 1526 (although presumed to be from the later 17th century). This design has a straight bridge, one melody string, two drone strings, and one row of keys, with a body resembling a lute.
*Esseharpa (Swedish for &quot;Esse harp&quot;) or ähtävän harppu (Finnish for &quot;Ähtävä harp&quot;) – Finnish/Fenno-Swedish nyckelharpa derivative, based on nyckelharpa examples from Fenno-Swedish former municipality Esse () in the Finnish region of Ostrobothnia (). It is small and cone-shaped with four (sometimes three) strings and one row of ten to fifteen keys.
*Vefsenharpa (&quot;Vefsn harp&quot;) – Norwegian nyckelharpa derivative, based on nyckelharpa examples from Vefsn Municipality () in Nordland county, Norway. Similar to the Esseharpa but with inward curves on the body.

=== Derivatives ===
*Viola a chiavi di Siena (&quot;Sienan keyed viola&quot;) or Siena-Harpa (&quot;Siena harp&quot;) for short – is a nyckelharpa derivative based on the previously mentioned 1408 fresco by Taddeo di Bartolo at the Palazzo Pubblico chapel in Siena, Italy, featuring an angel playing a nyckelharpa. As part of reconstructional archaeology, this recreated design has three melody strings, one drone string, and one row of keys.
*Viola d&#x27;amore a chiavi (&quot;keyed viola d&#x27;amore&quot;) – is a nyckelharpa derivative seemingly invented by professional luthier Alexander Pilz, a seasoned maker of nyckelharpor from Leipzig, Germany. It has gut strings and is specially built for renaissance-baroque music. It has a different sound than traditional Swedish Nyckelharpor, closer to the viola da gamba, and therefore has the name &quot;keyed viola d&#x27;amore&quot;.

<text>Suidae is a family of artiodactyl mammals which are commonly called pigs, hogs, or swine. In addition to numerous fossil species, 18 extant species are currently recognized (or 19 counting domestic pigs and wild boars separately), classified into between four and eight genera. Within this family, the genus &quot;Sus&quot; includes the domestic pig, &quot;Sus scrofa domesticus&quot; or &quot;Sus domesticus&quot;, and many species of wild pig from Europe to the Pacific. Other genera include babirusas and warthogs. All suids, or swine, are native to the Old World, ranging from Asia to Europe and Africa.

The earliest fossil suids date from the Oligocene epoch in Asia, and their descendants reached Europe during the Miocene. Several fossil species are known and show adaptations to a wide range of different diets, from strict herbivory to possible carrion-eating (in Tetraconodontinae).

==Physical characteristics==
Suids belong to the order Artiodactyla, and are generally regarded as the living members of that order most similar to the ancestral form. Unlike most other members of the order, they have four hooves on each foot, although they walk only on the middle two digits, with the others staying clear of the ground. They also have a simple stomach, rather than the more complex ruminant stomach found in most other artiodactyl families.

They are small to medium animals, varying in size from in length, and in weight in the case of the pygmy hog, to and in the giant forest hog. They have large heads and short necks, with relatively small eyes and prominent ears. Their heads have a distinctive snout, ending in a disc-shaped nose. Suids typically have a bristly coat, and a short tail ending in a tassle. The males possess a corkscrew-shaped penis, which fits into a similarly shaped groove in the female&#x27;s cervix.

Suids have a well-developed sense of hearing, and are vocal animals, communicating with a series of grunts, squeals, and similar sounds. They also have an acute sense of smell. Many species are omnivorous, eating grass, leaves, roots, insects, worms, and even frogs or mice. Other species are more selective and purely herbivorous.

Their teeth reflect their diet, and suids retain the upper incisors, which are lost in most other artiodactyls. The canine teeth are enlarged to form prominent tusks, used for rooting in moist earth or undergrowth, and in fighting. They have only a short diastema. The number of teeth varies between species, but the general dental formula is: .

==Behavior and reproduction==

Suids are intelligent and adaptable animals. Adult females (sows) and their young travel in a group (sounder; see List of animal names), while adult males (boars) are either solitary, or travel in small bachelor groups. Males generally are not territorial, and come into conflict only during the mating season.

Litter size varies between one and twelve, depending on the species. The mother prepares a grass nest or similar den, which the young leave after about ten days. Suids are weaned at around three months, and become sexually mature at 18 months. In practice, however, male suids are unlikely to gain access to sows in the wild until they have reached their full physical size, at around four years of age. In all species, the male is significantly larger than the female, and possesses more prominent tusks.

==Classification==


The following 18 extant species of suid are currently recognised:

<text>The Carse of Gowrie is a stretch of low-lying country in the southern part of Gowrie, Perth and Kinross, Scotland. It stretches for about along the north shore of the Firth of Tay between Perth and Dundee. The area offers high-quality agricultural land and is well known as a major area for strawberry, raspberry and general fruit growing. Fruit is easy to cultivate in the area because of its southerly aspect and low rainfall. It has been suggested that monks brought new varieties of apples and pears to the area in the Middle Ages and there may have been vineyards growing on slopes near the River Tay.

==Landscape==
The landscape of the Carse was created by glacial process and for part of the Mesolithic period the Carse of Gowrie was under water. Fertile fluvioglacial soils made the Carse a good place to settle and farm. Groome&#x27;s Ordnance gazetteer of Scotland, dating from the mid-1880s, describes Carse of Gowrie as having consisted of a series of isolated mounds, known as inches, surrounded by less well-drained land with stagnant pools still evident in 1760. The word inch, meaning an island, is still present in placenames such as the Inchmichael farms, the castle of Megginch, the village of Inchture and hamlet of Inchyra. The area was drained by cutting a number of artificial ditches many of which are known locally as pows (e.g. Pow of Glencarse, Grange Pow, Pow of Errol).

Norman nobles built castles at Megginch, Kinnaird and Fingask in the twelfth century.

In his travels preacher John Wesley described the Carse in May 1768 thus: &quot;We rode through the pleasant and fruitful Carse of Gowry, a plain long, between the river Tay and the mountains, very thickly inhabited, to Perth&quot;.

A great turnpike road was built through the Carse between Perth and Dundee in about 1800 (now the A90), and was connected by branch roads to Errol&#x27;s local harbours on the Tay at Port Allen and Powgavie. Prior to this, according to historian Lawrence Melville, the routes between places were &#x27;mere bridle tracks&#x27; and the main way of travelling between Perth and Dundee was on the River Tay by sailing ship or steamboat.

The Dundee and Perth Railway was created by Act of Parliament on 31 July 1845 and built a standard-gauge line through the Carse with stations at or near several villages including Invergowrie, Inchture, Errol, Glencarse and Kinfauns.

The Errol Clay formations were exploited extensively from the nineteenth century to make bricks, drainage tiles and pantiles for roofing at works at Inchcoonans, Falla, Pitfour and Waterybutts. Some older buildings in the area were built of clay and a few survive.

The Carse of Gowrie Sustainability Group are involved in Carse-wide environmental projects such as the Patrick Matthew trail which includes St Madoes, the Megginch estate, Inchture and Invergowrie. The group aim to develop relationships between communities, local authorities and the Scottish government to address local environmental issues.

The Carse Churches is a group of four Church of Scotland parish congregations with a ministry team (Abernyte, Inchture, Kinnaird and Longforgan).

The Carse Association for Continuing Education is a voluntary group founded in 1995 which organises adult education classes in church and village halls, primary schools and other social spaces.

<text>Târgoviște (, alternatively spelled &quot;Tîrgoviște&quot;) is a city and county seat in Dâmbovița County, Romania. It is situated north-west of Bucharest, on the right bank of the Ialomița River.

Târgoviște was one of the most important cities in the history of Wallachia, as it was its capital from 1418 to 1659. At the 2021 census, the city had a population of 66,965 people, making it the 27th largest in the country.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Târgoviște&quot; is a Slavic name which the city acquired in the Middle Ages. It is derived from the old Slavonic word for &quot;marketplace&quot;, referring to the place rather than the market itself.

The name is found in placenames not only in South Slavic areas (Bulgarian , Serbian and Croatian &quot;&quot;), but also in West Slavic such as Slovak &quot;Trhovište&quot;, Czech &quot;Trhoviště&quot; or Polish &quot;Targowica&quot;. Additionally, places with the same name are found in Romania, in the regions of Oltenia, Banat, and Moldavia.

The Romanian and Bulgarian towns with the same name are also twinned.

==History==
===Early history===
The area of Târgoviște which was first inhabited is located where the Saint Nicholas-Geartoglu Church and Stelea Veche Church stand today. It was in this place that the first fortifications were built: a small stone building surrounded by a brick wall and a moat, probably belonging to a local ruler. However, archaeological evidence is scarce and it is difficult to pinpoint exactly when it was erected.

===Saxon colony===
Another nucleus of the city was built by Saxon colonists from Transylvania, in the area where the Catholic Saint Mary Church is located, a church that was built during the early years of the colony. A local tradition says that the church was built in 1300. The colonists came around the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th century, the same period that Câmpulung was colonized. There is archeological evidence that the land occupied by the new colonists had been previously inhabited by locals, which leads to the conclusion that it had been approved by the local ruler.

The colonists influenced the local administration, as Târgoviște was the only town in Wallachia that had Transylvanian organization features, having official titles such as &quot;birău&quot; and &quot;folnog&quot;, which are found in documents together with local officials, like &quot;vornic&quot; and &quot;pristav&quot;. The town had a night watch which was also known by a Latin term (&quot;viglu&quot; &lt; &quot;vigilia&quot;) instead of the local terms such &quot;pază&quot; or &quot;strajă&quot;. Under Mircea the Elder (1383–1419), Târgoviște became the third capital of Wallachia.

After 1400, the town began to grow and become denser. In both the Saxon part (around the stronghold) and the Romanian part, there were several large dwellings with cellars and cocklestoves similar to those found in Central Europe. The wealth is also known based on the number of treasure troves discovered, the largest being a hoard of 6,284 silver coins, found in the Saxon part of the town. The town gravitated around the Saxon part, this being valid until the Saxon community began its decline during the 16th century.

===Capital of Wallachia===

In the 15th century, the capital of Wallachia was Curtea de Argeș, however, due to Târgoviște&#x27;s economic growth, toward the end of the century, it became a secondary residence of the Wallachian hospodar. In 1396, Bavarian traveler Johann Schiltberger mentions both Curtea de Argeș and Târgoviște as capitals of Wallachia. While Mircea I lived in Curtea de Argeș, Michael I, Mircea&#x27;s son and co-prince lived in Târgoviște, where he continued to live even as a single ruler. Dan II preferred Curtea de Argeș and he was the last hospodar to rule from that city, the court being finally moved to Târgoviște by Alexandru Aldea in 1431.

Throughout the period it was the capital of Wallachia, the Târgoviște Princely Court (&quot;Curtea Domnească din Târgoviște&quot;) had been constantly refurbished and extended. The compound was surrounded by stone walls and a moat and a new church and a tower had been built. Vlad III Dracula (&quot;the Impaler&quot;) later added the Chindia Tower, now a symbol of the city.

Starting with 1565, for the next two centuries, the rulers alternated the capital between Târgoviște and Bucharest, often on political reasons, as the former was preferred by the rulers who were more friendly toward Transylvania and the King of Hungary. Throughout the 15th and 16th centuries, Târgoviște was a major trade hub, especially with Poland, Brașov, and Sibiu.

By the 16th century, the Romanians became majority in the city, as some Saxons left for Transylvania and others were assimilated. Greek merchants began to settle in the city, especially after 1500, while Greek monks settled in the nearby Dealu and Panaghia monasteries.

As the capital of Wallachia, Târgoviște faced numerous sieges and invasions. In 1395, it was sieged and set on fire by Bayezid I. In 1457, the townsfolk of Târgoviște were punished by Vlad III Dracula for their involvement in the assassination of his brother: the elite of the city were killed, while the young were sent to work at his Poenari Castle.

The Ottoman invasion of 1462 did not reach the city, being prevented by Vlad III through the night attack at Târgoviște. In 1476, the city was taken by Stephen V Báthory following a fifteen-day siege intended to restore Vlad to the throne. Several other battles were fought near the city during the rules of Neagoe Basarab and Radu of Afumați.

In 1597, the Hajduks of Mihai Viteazul and Starina Novak fought and won a decisive battle against the Ottoman Empire in Târgoviște.

===Decline===
After the capital was finally moved to Bucharest during the rule of Constantin Brâncoveanu (1688–1714), Târgoviște lost its importance, decaying economically as its population decreased.

===Modern history===

Târgoviște was the site of the torture and execution of Tudor Vladimirescu on 7 June 1821 during the Wallachian uprising.

Târgoviște was the site of the trial and execution of Nicolae Ceaușescu and his wife Elena on 25 December 1989 during the Romanian Revolution.

==Geography==
One village, Priseaca, is administered by the city.

==Population==
In 2021, there were 66,965 inhabitants. According to the 2002 census, 96.6% of the inhabitants were Romanians and 2.84% Roma people.

<doc id="370029" wikidata="Q331254" url="?curid=370029" title="Atholl">
<text>Atholl or Athole () is a district in the heart of the Scottish Highlands, bordering (in clockwise order, from north-east) Marr, Gowrie, Perth, Strathearn, Breadalbane, Lochaber, and Badenoch. Historically it was a Pictish kingdom, becoming one of the original provinces of the Kingdom of Alba before being incorporated into the sheriffdom and later county of Perthshire. Today it forms the northern part of Perth and Kinross, Scotland.

== Etymology ==

In Scottish Gaelic the name is , which traditionally has been interpreted as deriving from the Old Irish , or &quot;New Ireland&quot; ( being a traditional name for Ireland). The explanation given for this relates to the Gaelic settlement of Scotland, which was previously inhabited by the Picts.

James E. Fraser has called the &quot;New Ireland&quot; interpretation into question. On the basis of the early spelling , the first element has been proposed as representing , meaning &quot;ford, way through&#x27;&quot; and the second , &quot;north&quot;, thus giving a full meaning &quot;way to the north&quot; (exactly as in the English name for Norway). may have represented a Gaelic equivalent of a Pictish name (c.f. Welsh ).

== History ==
=== Pictish kingdom ===
The first documented record of Atholl is an 8th-century mention in the &quot;Annals of Ulster&quot;, but three placenames in Atholl – the town of Dunkeld and the mountains Schiehallion and Rohallion – preserve the name of the Caledonians, a tribe or tribal confederation recorded by Roman writers including Tacitus and Cassius Dio.

Atholl is listed in the 9th century poem &quot;Seven Children of Cruithne&quot; and the longer Pictish King Lists as one of the seven Pictish territories founded by eponymous children of the mythical Pictish founder Cruithne son of Cinge. Atholl is the only one of these territories, apart from the dominant northern kingdom of Fortriu, to be historically documented as having its own king. The Northumbrian Bede, writing in the early 8th century, described how the Picts were divided by the Mounth and the Grampian Mountains into northern and southern groupings, with the southern Picts having their &quot;seats among the mountains&quot;. It is therefore possible that Atholl was the dominant royal region of the southern Picts, as Fortriu was in the north, before coming firmly under the grip of Fortriu during the 8th century Verturian Hegemony.

=== Province and earldom ===
Atholl emerged as one of the core provinces of the early Kingdom of Alba. The first known Mormaer of Atholl was Dubdon of Atholl, recorded in the &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Alba&quot; as having been killed during the battle between King Dub and his challenger Cuilén at Dorsum Crup in 965.

The first recorded Earl of Atholl was Matad, Earl of Atholl sometime in the 12th century. In 1703 the title was made a Dukedom by Queen Anne. The title also holds numerous subsidiary titles. These include: &quot;Marquess of Atholl&quot; (created 1676), &quot;Marquess of Tullibardine&quot; (1703), &quot;Earl of Atholl&quot; (1629), &quot;Earl of Tullibardine&quot; (1606 and 1676), &quot;Earl of Strathtay and Strathardle&quot; (1703), &quot;Viscount of Balquhidder&quot; (1676), &quot;Lord Murray of Tullibardine&quot; (1604), &quot;Lord Murray, Balvenie and Gask&quot; (1676) and &quot;Baron Percy&quot; (1722). The Barony of Percy forms part of the peerage of Great Britain; all other titles belong in the peerage of Scotland.

The right of the Earls of Atholl to hold courts for the area were ended in 1746 by the Heritable Jurisdictions Act,
and the province was subsequently only subject to the jurisdiction of the sheriff of Perth. In the mid 19th century, local government reforms replaced the ancient provinces by new Counties (&quot;shires&quot;), aligned to sheriffdom boundaries; hence, Atholl formed the northern portion of the new Perthshire.

Towns and villages in Atholl include Aberfeldy, Ballinluig, Blair Atholl, Dunkeld, Kirkmichael, Logierait, Pitlochry and Weem.

<text>Kingsbury is a London Underground station in Kingsbury, north-west London, England. It is on the Jubilee line between Queensbury and Wembley Park stations, in Zone 4, in the borough of Brent.

Although now only served by deep-level tube trains, the section of line serving the station is built to surface gauge, and trains to that larger LU loading gauge occasionally pass through.

==History==

The station was opened on 10 December 1932 as part of the Stanmore branch of the Metropolitan Railway and served by that company&#x27;s electric trains. After the formation of London Transport in 1933, this branch became part of the LU’s Metropolitan line which was later transferred to the Bakerloo line in 1939 and then to the Jubilee line in 1979. The design style is similar to that of other Metropolitan Railway buildings of the same period rather than to the concrete and glass style used at the same time by the LER group. In common with other nearby Metropolitan Railway stations (e.g. Harrow-on-the-Hill, Neasden, Queensbury) there is an element of fiction in the station name; the area is properly within the eastern extent of Kenton (Kingsbury Road at this point was originally part of the eastern end of Kenton Lane) and Kingsbury proper is actually closer to Neasden LU station.

==Location==
The station entrance is in a parade of shops on the south side of the A4006 Kingsbury Road, opposite Berkeley Road.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 79, 183, 204 and 324, night route N98, Superloop bus SL10 and non-TFL route 644 serve the station.

<text>Wembley Park is a London Underground station in Wembley Park, north-west London. It is served by the Jubilee and Metropolitan lines, and is in Travelcard Zone 4. On the Jubilee line the station is between Kingsbury and Neasden stations, and on the Metropolitan line it is between Preston Road and Finchley Road stations. It is located on Bridge Road (A4089) and is the nearest Underground station to exit for both Wembley Stadium and Wembley Arena. This is where the Jubilee line to Stanmore diverges from the Metropolitan line, which was formerly a branch of the Metropolitan Railway and was taken over by the Bakerloo line and is now part of the Jubilee line.

==History==

=== Before the station ===
Until 1880 the Metropolitan Railway (MR) line out of London only ran as far as . In early 1879 work began to build an extension to , with one additional station at Kingsbury and Neasden. Services to Harrow started on 2 August 1880, extending the MR route (today&#x27;s Metropolitan line) into Middlesex. At this time Wembley was a sparsely populated rural area which did not merit the construction of a railway station and MR trains passed through without stopping.

However the then chairman of the MR, Edward Watkin, was an ambitious businessman who sought new ways of attracting paying passengers out of London and onto his railway, and he regarded the barren lands of Wembley as a business opportunity.

=== Opening of the station ===
In 1881 Watkin purchased large tracts of land close to the MR line and began a grand scheme to build an amusement park at Wembley, laid out with boating lakes, a waterfall, ornamental gardens and cricket and football pitches. The centrepiece of this park was to be a soaring metal tower, known as Watkin&#x27;s Tower; at it was to be taller than the Eiffel Tower and would offer panoramic views of the surrounding countryside, just 12 minutes from Baker Street station. Wembley Park station was specially constructed to serve these pleasure grounds as a destination for excursion trips on the company&#x27;s trains. The station opened for the first time on 14 October 1893 and initially operated to serve only Saturday football matches in the park. It opened fully on 12 May 1894.

Watkin confidently anticipated that large crowds would flock to the park and the railway station design incorporated additional platforms to handle large passenger numbers. Watkin&#x27;s Tower ran into structural and financial difficulty; it was never completed and the partially built structure was demolished in 1904. Despite this, Wembley Park itself remained a popular attraction and flourished.

Later in the 1890s, the Great Central Railway&#x27;s (GCR&#x27;s) London extension was constructed adjacent to the MR&#x27;s tracks. The tracks pass under the entrance building but the station has never been served by main line operators. In 1905 the tracks were electrified and the first electric trains became operational. Between 1913 and 1915, the MR added additional tracks to double the line&#x27;s capacity.

From 1915 the MR began a programme of selling off its surplus land holdings in Buckinghamshire, Hertfordshire and Middlesex for suburban housing development. Its Metropolitan Railway Country Estates Limited marketed areas such as Wembley Park under the &quot;Metro-land&quot; brand, promoting modern homes in beautiful countryside with a fast railway service to central London. The MR sold the park land at Wembley when the site was selected to host the 1924 British Empire Exhibition and the grand British Empire Exhibition Stadium constructed for this event was later to become Wembley Stadium, the home ground of the England national football team.

=== Stanmore branch and Bakerloo line ===
On 10 December 1932, the MR opened a branch line north from Wembley Park to Stanmore. Originally, the MR served all stations south from Wembley Park to Baker Street station but the line suffered from congestion due to limited capacity on the tracks heading into Baker Street. Following the combination of the MR and London&#x27;s other underground railways to form the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) in 1933, the LPTB took steps to alleviate the congestion by constructing new Bakerloo line tunnels from Baker Street to connect to the Metropolitan&#x27;s tracks south of Finchley Road station. From 20 November 1939, the Bakerloo line then took over the Stanmore branch between Baker Street and Stanmore, including the Metropolitan stopping services between Wembley Park and Finchley Road.

=== 1948 Olympic Games ===
Following World War II, London was chosen to host the 1948 Olympic Games. To handle the exceptional number of spectators visiting Wembley Stadium, the original station building was extended, with a new ticket hall, additional circulation routes and platform stairs. This was built in a red-brick modernist style. At the opening of the Jubilee line on 1 May 1979, the Bakerloo line service from Baker Street to Stanmore was transferred to the new line.

=== UEFA Euro 1996 ===
When the UEFA European Football Championship was held at Wembley in 1996, a large temporary staircase was constructed leading down from the 1948 extension and under the newly built Bobby Moore Bridge, which had opened in 1993. Intended as a temporary structure, the staircase remained in its unfinished state until 2004 when station upgrade works commenced.

=== Upgrade and expansion ===
As part of the Wembley Stadium redevelopment in the early 2000s, the station was comprehensively rebuilt and expanded, increasing capacity by 70%. Costing £80m, the work included a significantly larger ticket hall, additional footbridges, widened stairs to Olympic Way and 5 lifts to provide step-free access. To cater for event crowds, event day entrances/exits were also constructed. Undertaken by Tube Lines, the expansion was completed in 2006, prior to the completion of the delayed Stadium project. The provision of additional platforms for Chiltern Railways services was considered, but was not proceeded with.

In the early 2020s, Transport for London proposed a new residential development on land adjacent to the station currently used as car parking. This development of over 450 new homes with Barratt Homes was approved by Brent Council in Dec 2020.

==Layout==

The station has six platforms. The Jubilee line trains use the central platforms 3 and 4, and the Metropolitan line trains use platforms 1, 2 5 and 6.

== Connections ==
The station is also served by London Buses routes 83, 182, 206, 223, 297 and night route N83.

<doc id="370033" wikidata="Q1857076" url="?curid=370033" title="Neasden tube station">
<text>Neasden () is a London Underground station in Neasden, north-west London. It is on the Jubilee line between Wembley Park and Dollis Hill stations, and is located in Travelcard Zone 3. Metropolitan line trains pass through the station but do not stop. The Chiltern Main Line/London to Aylesbury Line runs to the west of the station.

== History ==

The station opened on 2 August 1880 as part of the ongoing extensions to the Metropolitan Railway (this time to Harrow), with the name Kingsbury and Neasden. The name was changed to Neasden and Kingsbury in 1910, and then changed again to its current name Neasden in 1932, the same year Kingsbury station opened. After the Metropolitan Railway was taken into public ownership in 1933, train services to Stanmore were transferred to the new eastern branch of the Bakerloo line in 1939 and Metropolitan line trains ceased to stop at the station the following year. In 1979, the main service was transferred to the Jubilee line.

The station&#x27;s surface building is located in Neasden Lane. It has been extensively modified over the years, losing its original roof and high chimneys in the late 20th century, and a segment of the front was rebuilt around 1993 to remove a newsagent previously placed there. As well as the ticket office there are three ticket collection barriers and a single luggage gate (these were installed in the late 1990s; prior to this there were no barriers and just a gate), and the station also has a shop. The stairs from the surface building lead to four platforms. Platforms 1 and 4 are on the Metropolitan line, served on a few days a year for local events and when necessary due to disruptions to normal services. Platforms 2 and 3 were the northbound and southbound platforms for the Bakerloo line and since 1979 are now used by the Jubilee line. The platforms are constructed to &quot;transition height&quot; to allow regular use by tube trains of the Jubilee line and occasional (early morning, late night and during work on the line) use by the larger Metropolitan Line trains.

Platforms 1, 2 and 3 were built originally in 1880. Neasden had three platforms, which was unusual for a small station. The reason for three platforms was that Neasden was a terminus for many local Metropolitan trains from London and which would be stabled in the nearby depot. Platforms 4 and 5 were built in 1914 as a result of the quadrupling of the Metropolitan between Finchley Road and Harrow-on-the-Hill. Platform 5 was used as a bay platform for trains terminating at Neasden from stations north on the Met such as Stanmore. This platform was removed later on and the track is now used as a relief siding for the depot.

Neasden is one of the few stations on the southern section of the former Metropolitan Main line to still have its original platform buildings intact and its architecture is typical for a station serving a medium-sized village. Baker Street and Willesden Green are the other stations to have their platform buildings intact. The line between Finchley Road and Harrow-on-the-Hill was quadrupled between 1914 and 1916, and many intermediate stations had to be rebuilt to enable the fast lines to be built. Jubilee line trains sometimes terminate at Neasden.

It was proposed in 2008 that the North and West London Light Railway could serve the station.

<doc id="370034" wikidata="Q1136315" url="?curid=370034" title="Legio IX Hispana">
<text>Legio IX Hispana (&quot;9th Hispanian Legion&quot;), also written as Legio VIIII Hispana, was a legion of the Imperial Roman army that existed from the 1st century BC until at least AD 120. The legion fought in various provinces of the late Roman Republic and early Roman Empire. The nickname &quot;Hispana&quot; was gained when it was stationed in Hispania under Augustus. It was stationed in Britain following the Roman invasion in AD 43. The legion disappears from surviving Roman records after and there is no specific account of what happened to it.

The unknown fate of the legion has been the subject of considerable research and speculation. One theory (per historian Theodor Mommsen) was that the legion was wiped out in action in northern Britain soon after AD 108, the date of the latest datable inscription of the Ninth found in Britain, perhaps during a rising of northern tribes against Roman rule. This view was popularised by the 1954 novel &quot;The Eagle of the Ninth&quot; in which the legion is said to have marched into Caledonia (modern-day Scotland), after which it was &quot;never heard of again&quot;.

This theory fell out of favour among modern scholars as successive inscriptions of IX Hispana were found in the site of the legionary base at Nijmegen (Netherlands), suggesting the Ninth may have been based there from , later than the legion&#x27;s supposed annihilation in Britain. The Nijmegen evidence has led to suggestions that IX Hispana was destroyed in later conflicts of the 2nd century. Suggestions include the Bar Kokhba revolt (AD 132–135) or Marcus Aurelius&#x27;s war against Parthia (AD 161–166) in Armenia. However, some scholars 
have ascribed the Nijmegen evidence to a mere detachment of IX Hispana, not the whole legion.

In any event, it is clear that the IX Hispana did not exist during the reign of the emperor Septimius Severus (r. AD 193–211), as it is not included in two identical but independent lists of the 33 legions existing in this period.

== Republican army (to 30 BC) ==
The origin of the legion is uncertain, but a 9th legion seems to have participated in the siege of Asculum during the Social War in 90 BC.

When Julius Caesar became governor of Cisalpine Gaul in 58 BC, he inherited four legions, numbered VII, VIII, IX, X, that were already based there. The Ninth (IX) may have been quartered in Aquileia &quot;to guard against attacks from the Illyrians&quot;. Caesar created two more legions (XI and XII), using all six for his attack on the Helvetii initiating the Gallic wars.

The Caesarian Ninth Legion fought in the battles of Dyrrhachium and Pharsalus (48 BC) and in the African campaign of 46 BC. After his final victory, Caesar disbanded the legion and settled the veterans in the area of Picenum.

Following Caesar&#x27;s assassination, Caesar&#x27;s ally Ventidius Bassus made attempts to recreate the 7th, 8th, and 9th legions, but &quot;it is not clear that any of these survived even to the time of Philippi&quot;.
Octavian later recalled the veterans of the Ninth to fight against the rebellion of Sextus Pompeius in Sicily. After defeating Sextus, they were sent to the province of Macedonia. The Ninth remained with Octavian in his war of 31 BC against Mark Antony and fought by his side in the Battle of Actium.

== Imperial Roman army (30 BC – AD 130?) ==


With Octavian, whom the Senate later titled Augustus, established as sole ruler of the Roman world, the legion was sent to Hispania to take part in the large-scale campaign against the Cantabrians (25–19 BC). The nickname Hispana (&quot;stationed in Hispania&quot;) is first found during the reign of Augustus and probably originated at that time.

After this, the legion was probably part of the imperial army in the Rhine borderlands that was campaigning against the Germanic tribes. Following the abandonment of the eastern Rhine area (after the disastrous Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in AD 9), the Ninth was relocated in Pannonia.

=== Britain (AD 43 – at least 108) ===

In AD 43, the legion most likely participated in the Roman invasion of Britain led by the emperor Claudius and general Aulus Plautius, because they soon appear amongst the provincial garrison. In AD 50, the Ninth was one of two legions that defeated the forces of Caratacus. Around the same year, the legion constructed a fort, Lindum Colonia, now Lincoln. Under the command of Caesius Nasica they put down the first revolt of Venutius, king of the Brigantes tribe, between 52 and 57.

The Ninth suffered a serious defeat at the Battle of Camulodunum under Quintus Petillius Cerialis in the rebellion of Boudica (61), when most of the foot-soldiers were killed in a disastrous attempt to relieve the besieged city of Camulodunum (Colchester). Only the cavalry escaped. The legion was later reinforced with legionaries from the Germania provinces. When Cerialis returned as governor of Britain ten years later, he took command of the Ninth once more in a successful campaign against the Brigantes in 71–72, to subdue north-central Britain. Around this time they constructed a new fortress at York (Eboracum), as shown by finds of tile-stamps from the site.

The Ninth participated in Agricola&#x27;s invasion of Caledonia (modern Scotland) in 82–83. According to Tacitus, the legion narrowly escaped destruction when the Caledonians beyond the Forth launched a surprise attack at night on their fort. The Caledonians &quot;burst upon them as they were terrified in their sleep&quot;. In desperate hand-to-hand fighting the Caledonians entered the camp, but Agricola was able to send cavalry to relieve the legion. Seeing the relief force, &quot;the men of the Ninth Legion recovered their spirit, and sure of their safety, fought for glory&quot;, pushing back the Caledonians.
The legion also participated in the decisive Battle of Mons Graupius.

The last attested activity of the Ninth in Britain is during the rebuilding in stone of the legionary fortress at York (Eboracum) in 108. This is recorded in an inscribed stone tablet discovered in 1864, now displayed in the Yorkshire Museum in York.

=== Germania Inferior (108? – 130?)===

Several inscriptions attesting IX Hispana have been found in the site of the legionary fortress on the lower Rhine river at &quot;Noviomagus Batavorum&quot; (Nijmegen, Netherlands). These include some tile-stamps (dated 104–120); and a silver-plated bronze pendant, found in the 1990s, that was part of a &quot;phalera&quot; (military medal), with &quot;LEG HISP IX&quot; inscribed on the reverse. In addition, an altar to Apollo, dating from this period, was found at nearby &quot;Aquae Granni&quot; (Aachen, Germany), erected in fulfillment of a vow, by Lucius Latinius Macer, who describes himself as &quot;primus pilus&quot; (chief centurion) and as &quot;praefectus castrorum&quot; (&quot;prefect of the camp&quot;, i.e. third-in-command) of IX Hispana. (it was commonplace for chief centurions, on completion of their single-year term of office, to be promoted to &quot;praefectus castrorum&quot;).

The archaeological evidence thus appears to indicate that elements of IX Hispana were present at Noviomagus sometime after AD 104 (when the previous incumbent legion, X Gemina, was transferred to the Danube) and that IX was probably replaced by a detachment of legion XXX Ulpia Victrix not long after AD 120.
Less clear is whether the whole IX legion was at Nijmegen or simply a detachment. The evidence for the presence of senior officers such as Macer convinced several scholars that the Ninth Legion as a whole was based there between 121 and 130. It may have been both: first a detachment, later followed by the rest of the legion: a &quot;vexillatio Britannica&quot; (&quot;British detachment&quot;) is also attested at Nijmegen in this period. However, it is unclear whether this detachment was drawn from the IX Hispana (and its attached auxiliary regiments) alone, or from a mix of various British-based units.

== Theories about the Ninth&#x27;s disappearance ==
The Nijmegen finds, dating to c. 120, were (as of 2015) the latest records of Legion IX found. The Ninth was apparently no longer in existence after 197. Two lists of the legions survive from this era, one inscribed on a column found in Rome (CIL VI 3492) and the other a list of legions in existence &quot;today&quot; provided by the contemporary Greco-Roman historian Dio Cassius, writing c. 210–232 (&quot;Roman History&quot; LV.23–24). Both these lists date from after 197, as both include the 3 &quot;Parthica&quot; legions founded by Septimius Severus in that year. Both lists provide an identical list of 33 legions. Neither includes a &quot;IX Hispana&quot;. It thus appears that IX Hispana disappeared sometime in the period 120–197.

The traditional theory is that the Ninth was destroyed in a war on Britain&#x27;s northern frontier against the indigenous Celtic tribes. According to the eminent 19th-century German classicist Theodor Mommsen, &quot;under Hadrian there was a terrible catastrophe here, apparently an attack on the fortress of Eboracum [York] and the annihilation of the legion stationed there, the very same Ninth that had fought so unluckily in the Boudican revolt.&quot; He suggested that a revolt of the Brigantes soon after 108 was the most likely explanation. Mommsen cited as evidence the Roman historian Marcus Cornelius Fronto, writing in the AD 160s, who told the emperor Marcus Aurelius: &quot;Indeed, when your grandfather Hadrian held imperial power, what great numbers of soldiers were killed by the Jews, what great numbers by the Britons&quot;. The emperor Hadrian (r. 117–138) visited Britain in person around AD 122, when he launched the construction of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall because, according to one Roman source, &quot;the Britons could not be kept under Roman control&quot;. It is plausible that Hadrian was responding to a military disaster.
However, there is no archaeological evidence of it around 120.

Mommsen&#x27;s thesis was published long before the first traces of IX Hispana were found at Nijmegen. As a result of these, and of inscriptions proving that two senior officers, who were deputy commanders of the Ninth in c. 120, lived on for several decades to lead distinguished public careers, led to the Mommsen theory falling out of favour with many scholars. These now suggest later conflicts in other theatres as possible scenes of IX Hispana&#x27;s demise:
# The Second Jewish Revolt against the Romans in Judea that broke out in 132. It was reported that the Romans suffered heavy casualties in this war, whose start-date fits neatly with the estimated time of IX Hispana&#x27;s departure from Nijmegen (120–130). In this scenario, the Ninth may have been dispatched to Judea to reinforce the locally based legions, but was heavily defeated by Judean forces and the remnants of the unit disbanded. However, another legion, XXII Deiotariana, normally based in Egypt, is actually documented in Judea at this time and its surviving datable records also cease c. 120. It is possible that both legions were destroyed by the Judeans, but if so this would rate as the worst Roman military disaster since the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest (AD 9) when 3 legions were lost.
# The emperor Marcus Aurelius&#x27; Parthian War (161–166) against King Vologases IV. According to Greco-Roman historian Cassius Dio, a Parthian army led by the general Chosroes surrounded and annihilated an unspecified Roman legion in Armenia. This led to the suicide of its commander, the governor of Cappadocia, Marcus Sedatius Severianus. At this time, there were two legions permanently stationed in Cappadocia, the XII Fulminata and the XV Apollinaris. Both these units are attested as operational well beyond AD 200, so neither could have been the legion destroyed by the Parthians. The theory that the Ninth was the lost legion has the drawback that there is a complete lack of evidence that the Ninth was present in the East in the period 130–160. Some scholars argue that the legion referred to by Dio was the XXII Deiotariana, but if so, the latter could not have been annihilated by the Judeans thirty years earlier.

Several scholars continue to argue that destruction in Britain is the most likely scenario for the Ninth&#x27;s disappearance. Russell argues that &quot;by far the most plausible answer to the question &#x27;what happened to the Ninth&#x27; is that they fought and died in Britain, disappearing in the late 110s or early 120s when the province was in disarray&quot;.
Such scholars criticise the assumptions of those who extrapolate from inscription evidence, arguing that it is easy to confuse evidence about different persons with the same name. It is highly unlikely that if the legion continued in existence up to the Armenian war of 161, no records at all later than c. 120 would be known. Keppie says that &quot;no inscriptions recording the building activities of the legion or the lives and careers of its members have come from the East&quot;, suggesting that if the legion did leave Britain, it ceased to exist very soon afterwards. Russell argues that &quot;there is no evidence that the Ninth were ever taken out of Britain.&quot; He has claimed that the tile stamps found at Nijmegen cannot be dated to the period after 120, but &quot;all seem to date to the AD 80s, when detachments of the Ninth were indeed on the Rhine fighting Germanic tribes.&quot; Keppie also says that the tiles cannot be securely dated, but suggests that they date from c. 105 during a temporary absence of the legion from Britain.
However, Keppie does not support the theory that the legion met its end in Britain. He suggests that the legion may have been withdrawn from York around 117 to take part in the war in Parthia at the end of Trajan&#x27;s reign. Keppie suggests that it was the legion&#x27;s absence elsewhere that encouraged a native uprising, obliging Hadrian to send the Legio VI Victrix to Britain.

The fate of the Ninth remains the subject of vigorous debate among scholars. Frere noted that &quot;further evidence is needed before more can be said&quot;.

<text>Willesden Green () is a London Underground station on Walm Lane in Willesden. It is on the Jubilee line between Dollis Hill and Kilburn stations. Metropolitan line trains also pass through the station, but do not stop. The station is in both Travelcard Zone 2 and Zone 3.

==History==

The original station opened on 24 November 1879 on the Metropolitan Railway (later the Metropolitan line). 
From 1894 to 1938, the station was known as Willesden Green and Cricklewood. From 20 November 1939, it also served the Stanmore branch of the Bakerloo line, with Met services being withdrawn in the following year. It transferred to the Jubilee line in 1979. A connecting tunnel at Embankment station mistakenly shows &quot;Willesden Green&quot; as part of the Bakerloo line, as a result of a typo which should say &quot;Willesden Junction&quot; instead; this can be found on a printed map on the wall of Embankment station.

The new main station buildings, which date from the reconstruction of 1925, are fine examples of the work of Charles Walter Clark, the Metropolitan Railway&#x27;s architect, who used this style of marble white faience for several &#x27;central&#x27; area stations. The diamond-shaped clock is also a trademark of his style. The ticket hall interior retains much of the rare original green tesserae mosaic tiling and was one of the reasons that led to the station being made a Grade II Listed Building in December 2006.

Willesden Green is one of the few stations on the southern section of the former Metropolitan main line still to have its original platform buildings intact and its architecture is typical for a station serving a medium-sized town; Baker Street and Neasden are the other stations to have their platform buildings intact. The line between Finchley Road and Harrow-on-the-Hill was quadrupled between 1914 and 1916, and many intermediate stations had to be rebuilt to enable the fast lines to be built.

A goods yard, which was in use until 1966, was located to the north of the station. From 1933, when the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) took over service, trains from the north would be run by the LNER to Neasden Depot where they would be then hauled by LPTB steam locos to Willesden.

From the beginning of October 2022 to September 2023, this station was used to trial an artificial intelligence that would detect events such as fare evasion, anti-social behaviour and injured persons. This was done by installing a processing device that had access to the CCTV cameras present in the station.

==Services==
Willesden Green station is on the Jubilee line between Dollis Hill to the north and Kilburn to the south. There is a frequent Jubilee line service at Willesden Green. Trains heading southbound terminate at North Greenwich or Stratford. It previously served Charing Cross until 1999, when the Jubilee line extension isolated the station from the rest of the line. Those heading northbound either terminate here, at Wembley Park or Stanmore. Willesden Green is also served as part of the Night Tube, which is run overnight on Fridays and Saturdays.

The station still has side platforms for the Metropolitan line who bypass the station without stopping at it, but these are not in regular use and are only used when the Jubilee line is not serving the station due to planned engineering works or severe service disruption.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 260, 266 and 460 serve the station.

<text>Kilburn is a London Underground station in Kilburn, north-west London. It is on the Jubilee line between Willesden Green and West Hampstead stations, and is located in Travelcard Zone 2. The station is on the A5 Kilburn High Road or Shoot-up Hill, approximately north of Brondesbury station. Metropolitan line trains typically bypass the station without stopping.

The station was first opened on the Metropolitan line in 1879 as part of an extension to Willesden Green. The two-track line through the station was quadrupled in the 1910s. After merging to form the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933, Metropolitan line services through the station were transferred to the Stanmore branch of the Bakerloo line, and the station was extensively rebuilt. This branch was then transferred again to the Jubilee line in 1979. The 1930s station building remains, and was refurbished in 2005. The station is now wheelchair accessible and has frequent train services to Central London.

==Location==
Kilburn serves the area of the name itself, which is a moderate commercial district and dense residential suburb. The place was said to be named after Cylla, then a Saxon, or from the 1121 Saxon term &quot;Cuneburna&quot; for &quot;the cattle stream&quot;. The earliest settlements near the station date back to 1847. The station is on the A5 Kilburn High Road or Shoot-up Hill. The road connects several stations including Brondesbury and Kilburn High Road. Nearby landmarks include the Red Lion, Kiln Theatre, Kilburn Grange Park, ICMP London and Kingsgate Primary School.

==History==
The Metropolitan Railway (MR) first opened a separate line called the Metropolitan and St. John&#x27;s Wood Railway (M&amp;SJWR) from Baker Street to Swiss Cottage. Due to low passenger numbers, the MR was considering options to extend the M&amp;SJWR further to provide new routes into Central London. Permission was granted to extend the line up to Harrow via Kilburn in 1874.

The station opened as &quot;Kilburn and Brondesbury&quot; on 24 November 1879 which formed part of the extension to Willesden Green. As there was an increase in traffic, the tracks from Finchley Road to Harrow (now Harrow-on-the-Hill) were to be quadrupled. Four-track operation started between Finchley Road and Kilburn in 1913, extending to Wembley Park in 1915. This created a bottleneck between Finchley Road and Baker Street.

On 1 July 1933, the MR amalgamated with other Underground railways, tramway companies and bus operators to form the London Passenger Transport Board, and the MR became the Metropolitan line of London Transport. Due to a bottleneck between Finchley Road and Baker Street, the Bakerloo line was to extend to Finchley Road and Stanmore to relieve congestion on the Metropolitan line. The extension would also take over the intermediate stations, including Kiburn. Construction began in 1936 and Kilburn became part of the Stanmore branch of the Bakerloo line on 20 November 1939, at which time the station was extensively rebuilt. Metropolitan line services through the station ceased on 7 December 1940, where services were fully transferred to the Bakerloo line. The station was renamed to its current name on 25 September 1950.

During World War II and throughout the 1950s and early 1960s consideration was given to various routes connecting north-west and south-east London via Central London. The Victoria line was given priority and it was not until after construction of that line started that detailed planning began for the new line. It was planned to run in an east–west direction along Fleet Street, and was to be named the Fleet line. Lack of funding meant that only the first stage of the proposed line, from Baker Street to Charing Cross was approved in July 1969; funding was agreed in August 1971. Construction began in 1972. In 1977, the name of the line was changed to the Jubilee line, to mark the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee that year. Trial running of trains began in August 1978 and the Jubilee line opened on 1 May the next year. The line had been officially opened by Prince Charles the previous day, starting with a train journey from Green Park to Charing Cross. This replaced the Stanmore branch of the Bakerloo line, with the initial section operating between Stanmore and Charing Cross.

==The station today==

One of the bridges just beyond the station which carries the four-track line over the A5 Kilburn High Road (then known as Watling Street) has the company name &quot;METROPOLITAN RAILWAY&quot; fixed on the sides of the viaduct. The numbers on the viaduct read &quot;1914&quot;, around the time when the Metropolitan Railway quadrupled its tracks from Finchley Road to Harrow-on-the-Hill.

In 2005, major refurbishing works took place, which involved the station being fully repainted, receiving a new CCTV system, better lighting, upgraded PA systems, new toilets, and new train indicator boards at the ticket hall and platform level. A lift was also installed at the station to provide step-free access from street to platform level. Heritage features were also retained throughout the refurbishment.
