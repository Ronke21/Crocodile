<text>The Worshipful Company of Leathersellers is one of the livery companies of the City of London. The organisation originates from the latter part of the 14th century receiving its Royal Charter in 1444, and is therefore the senior leather industry-related City Livery Company.

The Leathersellers&#x27; Company ranks fifteenth in the order of precedence of City livery companies. Its motto is &quot;Soli Deo Honor et Gloria&quot;, Latin for &quot;Honour and Glory to God Alone&quot;.

==Activities==
The Leathersellers&#x27; Company, which originally regulated leather merchants, continues to act as an advocate for the UK leather trade, together with its leather-associated City livery partners: the Cordwainers, Curriers, Girdlers, Glovers and Saddlers. Like these other livery companies, today it is primarily involved in philanthropic, charitable and educational activities.

==Schools==
The livery company is very closely linked with the Leathersellers&#x27; Federation of Schools (formerly Prendergast School), now comprising Prendergast Ladywell School, Prendergast School and Prendergast Vale School, all located within the London Borough of Lewisham. Since the mid-seventeenth century the Company has also been closely associated with Colfe&#x27;s School, today an independent co-educational school located at Lee, near Lewisham, London. In addition the Company supports and maintains its longstanding connection with the Institute for Creative Leather Technologies (now a part of the University of Northampton), successor to the college which the Company founded at Bermondsey in 1909 as Leathersellers&#x27; Technical College. The Company continues to support higher education through exhibitions (grants) to university students, a practice which began in 1603 when four &#x27;poor scholars&#x27;, two at Oxford and two at Cambridge, were awarded five pounds and five shillings each &quot;per annum&quot;. Today around 100 students receive exhibitions which enable them to study at various universities.

==Military affiliations==
The Leathersellers&#x27; Company is affiliated with the Royal Navy&#x27;s submarine HMS &quot;Audacious&quot;, the 1st Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards and with 230 Squadron RAF.

==Almshouses==
Like many other City livery companies, the Leathersellers have a long tradition of maintaining almshouses. The first almshouses run by the Company were built circa 1543-44, close to Leathersellers&#x27; Hall, on a site behind St Ethelburga&#x27;s Church and housed seven elderly people. In 1837 the Company also built almshouses at Barnet in north London; these were extended in the mid-nineteenth century. In 1866 it was decided to close the almshouses in the City and remove the residents from there to join those already at Barnet. The Company continues to maintain almshouses at Leathersellers&#x27; Close in the London Borough of Barnet, home to about 20 residents and managed by Harrison Housing on behalf of the Leathersellers&#x27; Barnet Charity.

== Leathersellers&#x27; Hall ==

The Company had six previous halls throughout its history, and is now based at its seventh hall, which was officially opened by the Earl of Wessex in May 2017. Its first hall was on London Wall but in 1543 the Company acquired the former Benedictine convent of St Helen&#x27;s, off Bishopsgate, and the subsequent halls have all been on that site, now St Helen&#x27;s Place. The fifth hall was destroyed in May 1941 during the London Blitz. Its sixth hall officially opened in 1960 and was demolished in 2011, though the façade of the building has been saved. The new, seventh hall, has been designed by Eric Parry .

<doc id="371684" wikidata="Q3873394" url="?curid=371684" title="Naval Aircraft Factory">
<text>The Naval Aircraft Factory (NAF) was established by the United States Navy in 1918 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was created to help solve aircraft supply issues which the Navy Department faced upon the entry of the U.S. into World War I. The United States Army’s requirements for an enormous quantity of airplanes created a decided lack of interest among aircraft manufacturers in the Navy&#x27;s requirements for a comparatively small quantity of aircraft. The Navy Department concluded that it was necessary to build a Navy-owned aircraft factory in order to assure a part of its aircraft supply; to obtain cost data for the department’s guidance in its dealings with private manufacturers; and to have under its own control a factory capable of producing experimental designs.

==History==
=== World War I ===
On 27 July 1917 Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels approved the construction of the Naval Aircraft Factory as a means for the government to promote industry efficiency, ensure engineering expertise, and to monitor costs. The contract was let on 6 August 1917, and ground was broken four days later. The main assembly building, Number 59, was completed by 28 November 1917. Work started on the first order, received 8 days before, for the construction of 50 H-16 patrol aircraft. By the end of the year, the work force numbered more than 700, under the management of Lieutenant Commander Fred G. Coburn.

An additional order for 100 H-16s was placed in February 1918. The increased need for flying boat construction during WWI meant expanding the factory into a final aircraft assembly plant, using civilian subcontractors to supply the components. Building 77, the main assembly building, was completed in August, measuring 100 feet wide, 680 feet long, and 51 feet in height. Building 75, a three-story office building, and Building 76, a six-story storehouse were added so that the NAF occupied 41 acres by September 1918. By the end of 1918, the NAF employed 3,640 workers, including 890 women.

On 27 March 1918, the first H-16 built by the NAF was successfully flown, just 228 days after ground breaking and 151 days from receipt of drawings. On 2 April the first two NAF-built H-16s were shipped to the patrol station at RNAS Killingholme, England. After World War I, when the 1922 United States Navy aircraft designation system came into effect, the second letter of the codes designating the manufacturer appropriately specified the latter N for all airframe designs coming from the Naval Aircraft Factory.

Between July 1917 and November 1918, the end of WWI, the NAF built 137 H-16s, 31 F-5-Ls, 4 N-1 Davis Gun Carriers, 17 sets of spares for the H-16 and 8 sets of spares for the F-5-L. In 1919, construction started on 80 MFs and 20 VE-7s. In 1920, construction began on 36 of Grover Loening&#x27;s M-81s, 6 Navy-Curtiss flying boats, and 4 TFs. In 1921, construction began on 15 PT-1s and 18 PT-2s.

In 1922, full-scale production of outside designs ended, and the NAF began concentrating on the testing and evaluation of aircraft, including both the modification to outside types and all-new in-house designs. Successful designs were then turned over to industry for production. The change in focus resulted in the disuse of some production buildings, which were converted into storage depots for unused aircraft. In 1922-1923, the NAF fabricated the USS &quot;Shenandoah&quot; (ZR-1), although final assembly took place at Naval Air Station Lakehurst, New Jersey, where the only hangar in the United States large enough to house the airship was located.

=== World War II ===
The NAF was a major parachute production center in the 1930s and 1940s, producing 30,000 in WWII. The NAF also worked on aircraft catapults and arresting gear starting in 1921.

In the 1934 under the Vinson-Trammell Act (co-sponsored by Carl Vinson), it was decided that the Navy would build 10% of its own aircraft to stay abreast of modern manufacturing techniques and costs. The NAF thus resumed large-scale aircraft production in 1936 on introduction of the N3N biplane trainer aircraft. In 1937, the NAF received orders to manufacture 44 SON-1 scout observation aircraft, and in 1938, 30 SBN-1s. In July 1941, the NAF was ordered to build 156 PBN-1 Nomad patrol flying boats. In 1942, the NAF delivered the first of eventually 300 OS2N-1s. 

In 1941 the NAF spun off the Aviation Supply Office, and in 1942 the NAF became the Naval Air Material Center. On 11 March 1942 Admiral Harold Rainsford Stark wrote &quot;It is desired to proceed immediately with the steps necessary to adapt the &#x27;drone&#x27; for warfare.&quot; Then, on 3 April 1942, an order was placed for the NAF to build 100 TDN-1s. In 1943, work began on Project Gorgon, a turbo-jet-powered missile. 

The NAF ended aircraft production with the end of World War II in 1945. Peak factory employment of 13,400 workers was achieved in June 1943, during WWII. In 1967, the NAF&#x27;s aero engine research merged with the Naval Air Propulsion Test Center. Located at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, on League Island, the main construction building still exists but was converted for use by the Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division as a facility for research and development.

<text>James Daniel May (born 16 January 1963) is an English television presenter and journalist. He is best known as a co-presenter, alongside Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond, of the motoring programme &quot;Top Gear&quot; from 2003 until 2015 and the television series &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; for Amazon Prime Video from 2016 to 2024. He also served as a director of the production company W. Chump &amp; Sons.

May has presented other programmes on themes including travel, science &amp; technology, toys, wine culture, and the plight of manliness in modern times. He wrote a weekly column for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;″s motoring section from 2003 to 2011.

==Early life==
James Daniel May was born in Bristol, the son of aluminium factory manager James May and his wife Kathleen. He was one of four children; he has two sisters and a brother. May attended Caerleon Endowed School in Newport, Wales. He spent his teenage years in South Yorkshire where he attended Oakwood Comprehensive School in Rotherham and was a choirboy at Whiston Parish Church.

May studied music at Pendle College, Lancaster University, where he learned to play the flute and piano; he also spent a year studying metalwork at a technical college. After graduating, May briefly worked at a hospital in Chelsea as a records officer and had a short stint in the civil service before taking up journalism and broadcasting in his thirties. He also held a part-time job as a moulder at the foundry his father was employed at and suggested in a 2017 interview with &quot;The Times&quot; that this formed his interest in mechanics.

==Journalism career==
During the early 1980s, May worked as a sub-editor for &quot;The Engineer&quot; and later &quot;Autocar&quot; magazine, from which he was dismissed for performing a prank. He has since written for several publications, including the regular column &quot;England Made Me&quot; in &quot;Car Magazine&quot;, articles for &quot;Top Gear&quot; magazine, and a weekly column in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

He has written the book &quot;May on Motors&quot; (2006), which is a collection of his published articles, and co-authored &quot;Oz and James&#x27;s Big Wine Adventure&quot; (2006), based on the TV series of the same name. He wrote the afterword to &quot;Long Lane with Turnings&quot;, published in September 2006, the final book by motoring writer L. J. K. Setright. In the same month, he co-presented a tribute to Raymond Baxter. &quot;Notes From The Hard Shoulder&quot; and &quot;James May&#x27;s 20th Century&quot;, a book to accompany the television series of the same name, were published in 2007.

===Dismissal from &quot;Autocar&quot;===

In an interview with Richard Allinson on BBC Radio 2, May confessed that in 1992 he was dismissed from &quot;Autocar&quot; magazine after putting together an acrostic in one issue. At the end of the year, the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Road Test Yearbook&quot; supplement was published. Each spread featured four reviews and each review started with a large red letter (known in typography as an initial or a drop cap). May&#x27;s role was to put the entire supplement together.

To alleviate the tedium, May wrote each review such that the initials on the first four spreads read &quot;ROAD&quot;, &quot;TEST&quot;, &quot;YEAR&quot; and &quot;BOOK&quot;. Subsequent spreads seemingly had random letters, starting with &quot;SOYO&quot; and &quot;UTHI&quot;; when punctuated, these letters spelt out the message: &quot;So you think it&#x27;s really good, yeah? You should try making the bloody thing up; it&#x27;s a real pain in the arse.&quot;

In a 2019 interview with Carscoops.com, May stated that while the hidden message originally passed through the magazine&#x27;s pre-printing review processes unnoticed, he was found out when readers began calling in to &quot;Autocar&quot;&#x27;s offices, thinking there might be a prize involved. Upon learning of this, the magazine&#x27;s management called for May to be fired.

==Television career==
His past television credits include presenting &quot;Driven&quot; on Channel 4 in 1998, narrating an eight-part BBC One series called &quot;Road Rage School&quot;, and co-hosting the ITV1 coverage of the &quot;2006 London Boat Show.&quot; He also wrote and presented a Christmas special called &quot;James May&#x27;s Top Toys&quot; (for BBC One). &quot;James May: My Sisters&#x27; Top Toys&quot; attempted to investigate the gender divide of toy appeal. In series 3, episode 3 of Gordon Ramsay&#x27;s &quot;The F Word&quot;, May managed to beat Ramsay in eating bull penis and rotten shark and with his fish pie recipe.

===&quot;Top Gear&quot;===
May was briefly a co-presenter of the original &quot;Top Gear&quot; series in 1999. During an interview in 2020, Jeremy Clarkson claimed that the show&#x27;s original producers had decided to replace him with May in 1999, though they felt dissatisfied with May as he was soon fired in 2000, shortly before the entire program was cancelled the following year. Following the first season of the show&#x27;s relaunch in 2002, Clarkson managed to convince Andrew Wilman to rehire him as Jason Dawe&#x27;s replacement. He first co-presented the revived series of &quot;Top Gear&quot; in its second series in 2003, where he earned the nickname &quot;Captain Slow&quot; owing to his careful driving style, and his OCD-like obsessions with order. Despite this sobriquet, he has done some especially high-speed driving – in the 2007 series, he took a Bugatti Veyron to its top speed of , then in 2010 he achieved in the Veyron&#x27;s newer 16.4 Super Sport edition. In an earlier episode he also tested the original version of the Bugatti Veyron against the Pagani Zonda F.

May, along with co-presenter Jeremy Clarkson and an Icelandic support crew, travelled by car to the magnetic North Pole in 2007, using a modified Toyota Hilux. In the words of Clarkson, he was the first person to go there &quot;who didn&#x27;t want to be there&quot;. He also drove a modified Toyota Hilux up the side of the erupting volcano Eyjafjallajökull.

Following the BBC&#x27;s decision not to renew Jeremy Clarkson&#x27;s contract with the show on 25 March 2015, May stated in April 2015 that he would not continue to present &quot;Top Gear&quot; as part of a new line-up of presenters.

===Science===
May presented &quot;Inside Killer Sharks&quot;, a documentary for Sky, and &quot;James May&#x27;s 20th Century&quot;, investigating inventions. He flew in a Royal Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon at a speed of around 1320 mph (2124 km/h) for his television programme, &quot;James May&#x27;s 20th Century&quot;. In late 2008, the BBC broadcast &quot;James May&#x27;s Big Ideas&quot;, a three-part series in which May travelled around the globe in search of implementations for concepts widely considered science fiction. He also presented &quot;James May&#x27;s Man Lab&quot; from 2010–2013. In 2013, May narrated &quot;To Space &amp; Back&quot;, a documentary on the influence of developments in space exploration on modern technology produced by Sky-Skan and The Franklin Institute.

===&quot;James May on the Moon&quot;===

&quot;James May on the Moon&quot; (BBC 2, 2009) commemorated 40 years since man first landed on the Moon. This was followed by another documentary on BBC Four called &quot;James May at the Edge of Space&quot;, where May was flown to the stratosphere (70,000 ft) in a US Air Force Lockheed U-2 spy plane. Highlights of the footage from the training for the flight, and the flight itself was used in &quot;James May on the Moon&quot;, but was shown fully in this programme. This made him one of the highest flying people, along with the pilot, at that time, after the crew of the International Space Station.

===&quot;James May&#x27;s Toy Stories&quot;===
Beginning in October 2009, May presented a six-part TV series showing favourite toys of the past era and whether they can be applied in the modern-day. The toys featured were Airfix, Plasticine, Meccano, Scalextric, Lego and Hornby. In each show, May attempts to take each toy to its limits, also fulfilling several of his boyhood dreams in the process. In August 2009, May built a full-sized house out of Lego at Denbies Wine Estate in Surrey. Plans for Legoland to move it to their theme park fell through in September 2009 because costs to deconstruct, move and then rebuild were too high; despite a final Facebook appeal for someone to take it, it was demolished on 22 September, with the plastic bricks planned to be donated to charity.

Also for the series, he recreated the banked track at Brooklands using Scalextric track, and an attempt at the world&#x27;s longest working model railway along the Tarka Trail between Barnstaple and Bideford in North Devon, although the attempt was foiled due to parts of the track being stolen and vandals placing coins on the track, causing a short circuit. Later, in 2011, May tried for the record again, proposing a race between German model railroad enthusiasts and their British counterparts. The two teams would start at opposite ends along double tracked mainline. This time, the effort succeeded with both teams successfully running three trains the entire route.

A special Christmas Episode called &quot;Flight Club&quot;, aired in December 2012. In this special, James and his team built a huge toy glider that flew 22 miles (35 km) from Devon to the island of Lundy.

In 2013, May created a life-size, fully functional motorcycle and sidecar made entirely out of the construction toy Meccano. Joined by Oz Clarke, he then completed a full lap of the Isle of Man TT Course, a full mile-long circuit.

===Oz and James===
In late 2006, the BBC broadcast &quot;Oz and James&#x27;s Big Wine Adventure&quot;, a series in which May, a committed bitter drinker, travelled around France with wine expert Oz Clarke. A second series was broadcast in late 2007, this time with May and Clarke in the Californian wine country, and was followed by a third series in 2009 called &quot;Oz and James Drink to Britain&quot;.

===&quot;James May: Our Man in...&quot;===

In January 2020, May hosted a travel documentary named &quot;James May: Our Man in Japan&quot;, the 6-episode series was released on Amazon Prime Video and follows May&#x27;s journey from the north end of Japan to its south. Over the course of three months, May explores and participate in many activities to truly understand the country which has intrigued him for a long time. During the trip through major cities like Tokyo and Kyoto, he is accompanied by a cast of different guides and translators.

A second series, &quot;James May: Our Man in Italy&quot;, is a travel documentary with May on a journey throughout the regions of Italy from Palermo to the Dolomites on a trip exploring the culture, food, and more.

A third series, &quot;James May: Our Man in India&quot;, is another travel documentary with James May on a journey throughout the country of India. In October 2024, May confirmed the series was cancelled.

==Internet presence==
May created Head Squeeze (now renamed &quot;BBC Earth Lab&quot;; May no longer features as a presenter). The channel is a mix of science, technology, history and current affairs. The first video was published in December 2012. Videos are produced by 360 Production for BBC Worldwide.

May created his own YouTube channel, titled &quot;JM&#x27;s Unemployment Tube&quot;, in 2015 after &quot;Top Gear&quot; was postponed by the BBC following Jeremy Clarkson&#x27;s dismissal. Mainly featuring cooking videos filmed from his kitchen, as well as mock builds of Airfix models, the channel has over 230,000 subscribers as of March 2021.

In 2016, May launched, with his former Top Gear presenters, a social network for motoring fans called DriveTribe.

In 2019, May moved on to created videos on a Drivetribe spin-off brand Foodtribe (replacing JM&#x27;s Unemployment Tube) frequently using a small, bedsit-like kitchen setup called &quot;The Bug-out Bunker&quot;. The channel has since been rebranded as &quot;What Next?&quot;

May became an Internet meme when one of his Foodtribe videos went viral. In it, while preparing to make two cheese sandwiches, May bluntly uttered the word &quot;cheese&quot; after placing a block of Red Leicester on a table. The quote went viral, and was used in various memes and image macros.

==Personal life==
May lives in Hammersmith, West London, with art critic Sarah Frater, with whom he has been in a relationship since 2000. In July 2010, May was awarded an honorary doctorate by Lancaster University, where he had previously studied music. He holds a Doctor of Letters degree.

In August 2014, May was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote against independence from the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

In June 2016, he supported Remain in the EU referendum. May has described his political leanings as &quot;liberal&quot;.

In 2020, May bought half the ownership of a pub in Swallowcliffe, Wiltshire, called The Royal Oak, which dates from the early 18th century and is a Grade II listed building.

===Vehicles===
May has owned many cars. These include a 2005 Saab 9-5 Aero, Bentley T2, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Triumph 2000, Rover P6, Alfa Romeo 164, 1971 Rolls-Royce Corniche, Triumph Vitesse, Jaguar XJS, 1992 Range Rover Classic Vogue, Datsun 120Y, Vauxhall Cavalier Mk1, a Ferrari 308 GTB, a 2015 Toyota Mirai, a 2021 Toyota Mirai, Ferrari F430, Ferrari 458 Italia, 1984 Porsche 911 Turbo, a 2019 Tesla Model S 100D, a 2016 BMW i3, and a 2005 Porsche Boxster S (which he claims is the first car he has ever purchased new).

May currently owns a 2010 Porsche 911 Carrera S facelift, a 2018 Alpine A110, a Fiat Panda, a Volkswagen Polo, a Tesla Model 3 Highland, a prototype 1989 Rover Mini Cooper RSP, &quot;a couple of Land Rovers&quot;, a Triumph Stag, a 2015 Ferrari 458 Speciale which he ordered following his exit from &quot;Top Gear&quot; and the VW Beach Buggy used in &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; Special &quot;The Beach Buggy Boys&quot;. He often uses a Brompton folding bicycle for commuting. He passed his driving test on his second attempt and justified this by saying &quot;All the best people pass the second time&quot;.

May obtained a light aircraft pilot&#x27;s licence in October 2006, having trained at White Waltham Airfield. He has owned a Luscombe 8A Silvaire, a Cessna A185E Skywagon, and an American Champion 8KCAB Super Decathlon with registration G-OCOK, which serves as a reference to a common phrase attributed to him.

<text>Oskar Korschelt (September 18, 1853 in Berthelsdorf – July 4, 1940 in Leipzig; some sources erroneously give him the name Oscar or Otto) was a German chemist and engineer who introduced the Asian strategy board game of Go to Europe, especially to Germany and Austria.

He was an industrial chemist working in the brewing industry. He arrived in Japan in 1875, teaching at Tokyo Medical School, which next year was merged into Tokyo University. In 1880 he gave up his academic position, then working on soil analysis for the Japanese government. He left Japan in 1884.

He learned about the game from Honinbo Shuho while in Japan. It is reported that they played on a six-stone handicap. After his return he lived in Leipzig.

He published a detailed article &quot;Das japanisch-chinesische Spiel Go, ein Konkurrent des Schach&quot; on Go in the journal &quot;Mitteilungen der Deutschen Gesellschaft für Natur und Völkerkunde Ostasiens&quot; in 1880/1. This report contained detailed commentaries on expert games. A few years later he published a book based on articles &quot;Das &quot;Go&quot;-Spiel&quot; from 1884, drawing on several Japanese sources.

<text>Olene Walker (née Smith; November 15, 1930 – November 28, 2015) was an American politician who served as the 15th governor of Utah from 2003 to 2005, succeeding the governorship after Mike Leavitt&#x27;s resignation.

A member of the Republican Party, Walker was Utah&#x27;s first female lieutenant governor of Utah as well the first and currently only female governor.

She is also the shortest serving Governor of Utah, serving for only a year and two months.

==Early life and education==
Walker was born Olene Smith in Ogden, Utah, in 1930 to Thomas Ole Smith and Nina (née Hadley) Smith, the second of their five children. She graduated from Weber High School. Walker received her bachelor&#x27;s degree from Brigham Young University in 1953, her master&#x27;s from Stanford University, and her doctorate in education administration from the University of Utah.

==Career==
Walker&#x27;s began her career in the Utah House of Representatives, including a term as Majority Whip, during which she helped create Utah’s Rainy Day Fund. She served in the Utah House from 1981 to 1989. She served as the fourth Lieutenant Governor of Utah for the 10 years prior to becoming governor. She founded the Salt Lake Education Foundation and served as its director. She served as director of the Utah Division of Community Development. She has chaired the Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice, the Utah State Housing Coordinating Committee, the Governor&#x27;s Commission on Child Care, and the National Conference of Lieutenant Governors. She also became the first woman governor of Utah. Senator Orrin Hatch said Walker &quot;truly paved the way for women in government in Utah.&quot; Also, throughout her political career &quot;her passion across the board&quot; was education.

=== Governorship ===
Walker assumed the office of Governor of the State of Utah after previous governor Mike Leavitt was nominated by President George W. Bush to lead the Environmental Protection Agency in 2003. Walker served as governor until the end of the term on January 3, 2005.

During her short term as governor, Walker focused on supporting education in Utah. She created the Read With a Child Early Literacy Initiative, visited classrooms often to read to children, and vetoed a proposal for vouchers for private schools with the reasoning that the proposal would take funding away from public schools. She also signed legislation ending the use of firing squads for execution in Utah and worked to preserve Utah wilderness and to create affordable housing.

In a move that caused a degree of controversy within the state, the Utah Republican Party at its convention on May 8, 2004, elected not to place Walker on the ballot for the party primary (held on June 22, 2004), selecting instead Jon Huntsman, Jr. and Nolan Karras as the two potential Republican party candidates for the office of Governor of the State of Utah, the first time in 48 years that an incumbent Utah governor failed to win a party nomination. Huntsman went on to win the primary election with more than 66% of the vote. These events effectively ruled out any possibility of Walker being on the ballot in the 2004 general election. Convention delegates defended their choice by claiming that many of the delegates were already pledged to other candidates, because Walker had served only six months as Governor before the party convention. She had also waited until two months before the nominating convention to choose to run for election, giving her rivals a head start to build their campaigns. She left office with an 87% approval rating.

===Olene S. Walker Institute of Politics &amp; Public Service===
In 2012 Walker created the Olene S. Walker Institute of Politics &amp; Public Service to &quot;help foster in Weber State University students and the broader community the ideals of public service and political engagement that motivated her decades-long career in Utah politics.&quot; The Walker Institute coordinates internships for Weber State University students, holds public forums and debates on public policy issues, and provides leadership and engaged-citizenship workshops for students and the community at large.

==Personal life==
Walker was married to Myron Walker; they had seven children. Walker and her husband were Latter-day Saints (Mormons). She and her husband served as International Affairs missionaries for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in New York City. Starting in spring of 2010 she served as the Primary president in the Bloomington 7th Ward on the south side of St. George, Utah.

Olene Walker died of natural causes on November 28, 2015, thirteen days after her 85th birthday.

==Recognition==
The State of Utah operates the Olene Walker Housing Loan Fund, which seeks to provide affordable housing throughout the state, renovate rural housing, protect tenants from landlords who seek to exploit them, and in other ways provide livable housing options to low income residents of the state.

In 2003, &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; named her Utahn of the Year.

In May 2010 the Utah County Democratic Party gave Walker its first distinguished service award.

Walker was one of the first co-chairs of the Utah Debate Commission.

Olene Walker Elementary School opened in 2020.

<doc id="371696" wikidata="Q151970" url="?curid=371696" title="Chi Rho">
<text>The Chi Rho (☧, English pronunciation ; also known as &quot;chrismon&quot;) is one of the earliest forms of the Christogram, formed by superimposing the first two (capital) letters—chi and rho (ΧΡ)—of the Greek ( Christos) in such a way that the vertical stroke of the rho intersects the center of the chi.

The Chi-Rho symbol was used by the Roman Emperor Constantine the Great (r. 306–337 AD) as part of a military standard (vexillum). Constantine&#x27;s standard was known as the Labarum. Early symbols similar to the Chi Rho were the Staurogram () and the IX monogram ().

In pre-Christian times, the Chi-Rho symbol was also used to mark a particularly valuable or relevant passage in the margin of a page, abbreviating &quot;chrēston&quot; (good). Some coins of Ptolemy III Euergetes (r. 246–222 BC) were marked with a Chi-Rho.

Although formed of Greek characters, the device (or its separate parts) is frequently found serving as an abbreviation in Latin text, with endings added appropriate to a Latin noun, thus &quot;XPo&quot;, signifying &quot;Christo&quot;, &quot;to Christ&quot;, the dative form of &quot;Christus&quot;, or &quot;&quot;, signifying &quot;Christicola&quot;, &quot;Christian&quot;, in the Latin lyrics of &quot;Sumer is icumen in&quot;. 

__toc__

== Origin and adoption ==
According to Lactantius, a Latin historian of North African origins saved from poverty by the Emperor Constantine the Great (r. 306–337), who made him tutor to his son Crispus, Constantine had dreamt of being ordered to put a &quot;heavenly divine symbol&quot; () on the shields of his soldiers. The description of the actual symbol chosen by Emperor Constantine the next morning, as reported by Lactantius, is not very clear: it closely resembles a Tau-Rho or a staurogram (), a similar Christian symbol. That very day Constantine&#x27;s army fought the forces of Maxentius and won the Battle of the Milvian Bridge (312), outside Rome.

Eusebius of Caesarea (died in 339) gave two different accounts of the events. In his church history, written shortly after the battle, when Eusebius had not yet had contact with Constantine, he does not mention any dream or vision, but compares the defeat of Maxentius (drowned in the Tiber) to that of the biblical pharaoh and credits Constantine&#x27;s victory to divine protection.

In a memoir of the Roman emperor that Eusebius wrote after Constantine&#x27;s death (&quot;On the Life of Constantine&quot;, –339), a miraculous appearance is said to have come in Gaul long before the Battle of the Milvian Bridge. In this later version, the Roman emperor had been pondering the misfortunes that befell commanders who invoked the help of many different gods, and decided to seek divine aid in the forthcoming battle from the One God. At noon, Constantine saw a cross of light imposed over the sun. Attached to it, in Greek characters, was the saying &quot;Εν τούτῳ Νίκα!&quot; (&quot;In this, conquer!&quot;). Not only Constantine, but the whole army saw the miracle. That night, Christ appeared to the Roman emperor in a dream and told him to make a replica of the sign he had seen in the sky, which would be a sure defence in battle.

Eusebius wrote in the &quot;Vita&quot; that Constantine himself had told him this story &quot;and confirmed it with oaths&quot; late in life &quot;when I was deemed worthy of his acquaintance and company.&quot; &quot;Indeed&quot;, says Eusebius, &quot;had anyone else told this story, it would not have been easy to accept it.&quot;

Eusebius also left a description of the labarum, the military standard which incorporated the Chi-Rho sign, used by Emperor Constantine in his later wars against Licinius.

== Later usage ==
=== Late antiquity ===

An early visual representation of the connection between the Crucifixion of Jesus and his resurrection, seen in the 4th century sarcophagus of Domitilla in Rome, the use of a wreath around the Chi-Rho symbolizes the victory of the Resurrection over death.

After Constantine, the Chi-Rho became part of the official imperial insignia. Archaeologists have uncovered evidence demonstrating that the Chi-Rho was emblazoned on the helmets of some Late Roman soldiers. Coins and medallions minted during Emperor Constantine&#x27;s reign also bore the Chi-Rho. By the year 350, the Chi-Rho began to be used on Christian sarcophagi and frescoes. The usurper Magnentius appears to have been the first to use the Chi-Rho monogram flanked by Alpha and Omega, on the reverse of some coins minted in 353. In Roman Britannia, a tesselated mosaic pavement was uncovered at Hinton St. Mary, Dorset, in 1963. On stylistic grounds, it is dated to the 4th century; its central roundel represents a beardless male head and bust draped in a &quot;pallium&quot; in front of the Chi-Rho symbol, flanked by pomegranates, symbols of eternal life. Another Romano-British Chi-Rho, in fresco, was found at the site of a villa at Lullingstone (illustrated). The symbol was also found on Late Roman Christian signet rings in Britain.

In 2020, archaeologists discovered in Vindolanda in northern England a 5th-century chalice covered in religious iconography, including the Chi-Rho.

=== Insular Gospel books ===
In Insular Gospel books, the beginning of Matthew 1:18, at the end of his account of the genealogy of Christ and introducing his account of the life, so representing the moment of the Incarnation of Christ, was usually marked with a heavily decorated page, where the letters of the first word &quot;Christi&quot; are abbreviated and written in Greek as &quot;XPI&quot;, and often almost submerged by decoration. Though the letters are written one after the other and the &quot;X&quot; and &quot;P&quot; not combined in a monogram, these are known as Chi-Rho pages. 

Famous examples are in the Book of Kells and Book of Lindisfarne. The &quot;X&quot; was regarded as the &quot;crux decussata&quot;, a symbol of the cross; this idea is found in the works of Isidore of Seville and other patristic and Early Medieval writers. The Book of Kells has a second Chi-Rho abbreviation on folio 124 in the account of the Crucifixion of Christ, and in some manuscripts the Chi-Rho occurs at the beginning of Matthew rather than mid-text at Matthew 1:18. In some other works like the Carolingian Godescalc Evangelistary, &quot;XPS&quot; in sequential letters, representing &quot;Christus&quot; is given a prominent place.

<doc id="371698" wikidata="Q3807565" url="?curid=371698" title="Meatloaf">
<text>Meatloaf is a dish of ground meat that has been combined with other ingredients and formed into the shape of a loaf, then baked or smoked. The final shape is either hand-formed on a baking tray, or pan-formed by cooking it in a loaf pan. It is usually made with ground beef, although ground lamb, pork, veal, venison, poultry, and seafood are also used, sometimes in combination. Vegetarian adaptations of meatloaf may use imitation meat or pulses.

The cooked meatloaf can be sliced like a loaf of bread to make individual portions. It can easily become dry; therefore, various techniques exist to keep the dish moist, like mixing in bread crumbs and egg, covering it with sauce, wrapping it, or using moisture-enhancing ingredients in the mixture, such as filling it with fatty meats, cheeses, or vegetables.

== History ==

Meatloaf is a traditional German, Czech, Scandinavian and Belgian dish, and it is a cousin to the meatball in Dutch cuisine.

North American meatloaf has its origins in scrapple, a mixture of ground pork and cornmeal served by German-Americans in Pennsylvania since colonial times. Meatloaf in the contemporary American sense did not appear in cookbooks until the late 19th century.

== National variations ==

=== Europe ===
The Austrian version of meatloaf is called &quot;faschierter Braten&quot; (literally &quot;minced &quot;, from &quot;faschieren&quot;, &quot;to mince&quot;, and &quot;ein Braten&quot;, &quot;a &quot;), also known as &quot;falscher Hase&quot;, or &#x27;fake rabbit&#x27;. Most of the time, it is not filled (as it may be in Germany), though the variation &quot;im Speckmantel&quot; involves wrapping the exterior in ham or bacon before baking. Often, it is served with mashed potatoes (when warm), or with Cumberland sauce (when cold).

The Belgian version of meatloaf is called &quot;vleesbrood&quot; (meatbread); however, &quot;fricandon&quot; is also used to refer to it in Dutch. In French, it is called &quot;pain de viande&quot;. It is usually served warm and can then be served with various sauces, but can also be eaten cold with a loaf of bread.

&quot;Rulo Stefani&quot; (), a Bulgarian meatloaf is similar to the Hungarian &quot;Stefánia&quot; meatloaf, with hard-boiled eggs, and sometimes with chopped carrots and pickled gherkins in the middle.

In the Czech Republic, meatloaf is referred to as &quot;sekaná&quot; (&#x27;chopped&#x27;). It is optional to put hard boiled eggs, gherkins, or wienerwurst inside.

Danish meatloaf is called &quot;forloren hare&quot; (&#x27;mock hare&#x27;) or &quot;farsbrød&quot; (&#x27;ground-meat bread&#x27;) and is usually made from a mixture of ground pork and beef with strips of bacon or cubed bacon on top. It is served with boiled or mashed potatoes and brown gravy sweetened with red currant jam.

Finnish meatloaf is called &quot;lihamureke&quot;. It is entirely based on the basic meatball recipe. The only spices used are salt and pepper. It is not customary to stuff &quot;lihamureke&quot; with anything. The usual side dish is mashed potatoes, and &quot;lihamureke&quot; is usually served with brown sauce.

In Germany, meatloaf is referred to as &quot;Hackbraten&quot; (literally &quot;ground roast&quot;, from &quot;Hackfleisch&quot;, &quot;ground meat&quot;, and &quot;ein Braten&quot;, &quot;a &quot;), &quot;faschierter Braten&quot; (literally &quot;minced &quot;, from &quot;faschieren&quot;, &quot;to mince&quot;, and &quot;ein Braten&quot;, &quot;a &quot;), &quot;Wiegebraten&quot;, &quot;falscher Hase&quot; (&quot;false hare&quot; or &quot;faux hare&quot;) and &quot;Heuchelhase&quot; (&quot;mock-hare&quot;). In some regions, it often has boiled eggs inside. &quot;Fleischlaib&quot; does literally mean &quot;meat-loaf&quot;, but is actually another name for &quot;Leberkäse&quot; (literally &quot;liver-cheese&quot;), which is not a meatloaf.

In Greece, meatloaf is referred to as &quot;rolo&quot; (Ρολό) and it is usually filled with hard boiled eggs, although several other variations exist.

Stefania meatloaf () or Stefania slices are a type of Hungarian long meatloaf baked in a loaf pan, with three hard-boiled eggs in the middle, making decorative white and yellow rings in the middle of the slices.

In Italy, meatloaf is called &quot;polpettone&quot; and can be filled with eggs, ham and cheese, and other ingredients.

The Macedonian &quot;rolat&quot; is a similar dish to the chiefly Arab, though also Persian and South-Asian, kofta. Ground beef is rolled and cooked until brown. It can be cooked with vegetables and various sauces.

The Dutch version of meatloaf is called &quot;gehaktbrood&quot; and can be eaten warm or cold. &quot;Slavink&quot; is sometimes thought of as a small meatloaf, though it is pan-fried.

In Polish cuisine, the dish called &quot;pieczeń rzymska&quot; (&quot;Roman roast&quot;) or &quot;klops&quot; is made of ground pork, beef, onions and garlic, with an obligatory hard boiled egg inside.

In Romanian cuisine, there is a meatloaf dish called &quot;drob&quot;, similar to other minced meat dishes in the region like the Bulgarian &quot;rulo Stefani&quot; or the Hungarian &quot;Stefánia&quot; meatloaf. The major difference is that &quot;drob&quot; is always made with lamb organs (or a mixture of lamb organs and pork or veal), and the hard boiled eggs in the centre of the &quot;drob&quot; are optional.

Swedish meatloaf is called &quot;köttfärslimpa&quot; (literally &quot;minced meat-loaf&quot;, from &quot;köttfärs&quot;, &quot;minced meat&quot;, and &quot;limpa&quot;, &quot;loaf&quot;) and is usually made from a mixture of ground pork and beef. It is served with boiled or mashed potatoes, brown sauce gravy, often made from the meat juice that comes from cooking the meatloaf, and lingonberry jam. It is also used thinly sliced as a spread on sandwiches.

In the UK, there are regional pork meatloaf dishes known as haslet, which can be eaten cold or hot.

In British English, haslet or acelet is a pork meatloaf with herbs, originally from Lincolnshire. The word is derived from the Old French hastilles meaning entrails. In Lincolnshire, haslet (pronounced &#x27;/ˈhæslɪt/&#x27; locally) is typically made from stale white bread, minced pork, sage, salt and black pepper.[1] It is typically served cold with pickles and salad, or as a sandwich filling. In England, it is occasionally sold on a delicatessen counter.

=== Asia ===
In Korea, there are meatloaf dishes called tteok-galbi and neobiani.

&quot;Khuchmal&quot; () is served with mashed potatoes cooked over the ground meat.


&quot;Embutido&quot; (not to be confused with the Spanish &quot;embutido&quot;) is made of well-seasoned ground pork, raisins, minced carrots, sausages, and whole boiled eggs. The meat is molded into a roll with the sausages and hard boiled eggs set in the middle. Another variation of the dish involves wrapping the meatloaf with pork crow or mesentery. It is then wrapped in aluminum foil (historically, banana leaves) and steamed for an hour. The cooked &quot;embutido&quot; may be stored in freezers. It is usually served fried and sliced for breakfast.

&quot;Embutido&quot; is sometimes confused with &quot;morcón&quot; (also not to be confused with Spanish &quot;morcón&quot;), due to their similarity in appearance. However, &quot;morcón&quot; is a beef roulade, not a meatloaf.

&quot;Hardinera&quot; is a Filipino meatloaf made with diced or ground pork topped with sliced hard-boiled eggs, pineapples, carrots, bell peppers, peas, tomatoes, and raisins, among others.

In Turkish cuisine, there is a version of meatloaf called &quot;dalyan köfte&quot; or &quot;rulo köfte&quot;; it is typically filled with carrots, peas, and whole boiled eggs.

The Vietnamese meatloaf version is called &quot;chả&quot;. It is boiled rather than baked or smoked. There are many versions of &quot;chả&quot; that differ in the ingredients used.

=== South America ===

Chilean meatloaf, known as &quot;Asado Alemán&quot; (German roasted meat) is a staple of southern Chilean cuisine, especially in areas known for having been influenced by the arrival of German immigrants during the 18th and 19th century. The most common recipe nowadays consists of ground beef, carrots, sausages, boiled eggs and breadcrumbs, cooked in the oven and normally served with a side-dish of mashed potatoes or rice.

The Cuban version of meatloaf is called &quot;pulpeta&quot;. It is made with ground beef and ground ham, and stuffed with hard boiled eggs, and it is cooked on the stovetop. The dish was brought to public attention, albeit mistakenly referred to as a sausage, in the second episode of the third season of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, entitled &quot;Food for Thought&quot;. However, due to Cuba&#x27;s strict laws regarding the purchasing of meat products, especially beef, meatloaf is not a common dish in Cuba.

=== Jewish cuisine ===
In Ashkenazi Jewish cuisine, meatloaf is called &quot;Klops&quot; () and can be served cold or hot. It is sometimes filled with whole boiled eggs. The name presumably comes from the German &quot;Klops&quot; &#x27;meatball&#x27;.

=== Middle East ===
In Lebanon, &quot;kibbeh&quot; (ground beef or lamb mixed with Bulgar) can sometimes be formed into a loaf and baked. It is sometimes made from raw meat.

=== North America ===

Mexican meatloaf is known as &quot;albondigón&quot; and is small in size.

The first recorded recipe for the modern American meatloaf dates from the late 1870s. Those preparing the dish were told to chop up whatever meat was on hand, the meat most likely being beef. To that they added salt, pepper, onion, egg and milk-soaked bread. This meatloaf was originally served as a breakfast food.
During the Great Depression, cooking meatloaf was a way for families to stretch the food budget by using an inexpensive type of meat and left-over ingredients. Along with spices, it was popular to add cereal grains, bread or saltine crackers to the meatloaf to add bulk and stretch the meat. This tradition of additions still lives on, but with new goals: primarily, producing a lower-fat dish with superior binding and consistency.

Meatloaf recipes in America are typically made with a sauce or relish, often applied before cooking. Many recipes call for a tomato sauce to be poured over the loaf, which forms a crust during baking. A simple brown or onion gravy or a can of cream of mushroom soup can substitute for tomato-based sauce, but the meatloaf is prepared in a similar manner. Barbecue sauce, tomato ketchup, or a mixture of ketchup and prepared mustard may also be used. This style of meatloaf may be topped with a &quot;meatloaf sauce&quot; consisting of ketchup and brown sugar. Another variety of meatloaf, in the same style, is prepared by &quot;frosting&quot; the loaf with mashed potatoes, drizzling a small amount of butter over the top, and then browning it in the oven.

Some recipes are even more imaginative. There are vegetarian meatloaves, vegan meatloaves, even meatloaves made with ahi tuna, French fries, Fritos, Spanish chorizo, mint and pine nuts. Sculpted versions such as feetloaf are also becoming popular, especially on social media.

Meatloaf in America is normally served warm, as part of a main course, but it can also be sliced as a cold cut (and then used in sandwiches). This dish can be considered a typical comfort food in the US and Canada, and so it is served in many diners and restaurants. Indeed, meatloaf is said to have attained iconic comfort food status along with hamburgers, fried chicken and mac and cheese. In a 2007 poll by &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, meatloaf was the seventh-favorite dish of Americans.

In Puerto Rican cuisine, meatloaf is known as &quot;albondigón&quot; or &quot;butifarrón al horno&quot;. Puerto Rican style meatloaf is made with ground pork, beef, turkey, adobo, Worcestershire sauce, milk, ketchup, potatoes, red beans, breadcrumbs, parsley, and a hard-boiled egg in the middle.

<doc id="371700" wikidata="Q1202471" url="?curid=371700" title="Locale (computer software)">
<text>In computing, a locale is a set of parameters that defines the user&#x27;s language, region and any special variant preferences that the user wants to see in their user interface. Usually a locale identifier consists of at least a language code and a country/region code.
Locale is an important aspect of i18n.
== General locale settings ==

These settings usually include the following display (output) format settings:

* Number format setting (LC_NUMERIC, C/C++)
* Character classification, case conversion settings (LC_CTYPE, C/C++)
* Date-time format setting (LC_TIME, C/C++)
* String collation setting (LC_COLLATE, C/C++)
* Currency format setting (LC_MONETARY, C/C++)
* Paper size setting (LC_PAPER, ISO 30112)
* Color setting
* UI font setting (especially for CJKV language)
* Location setting (country or region)
* ANSI character set setting (for Microsoft Windows)

The locale settings are about formatting output given a locale. So, the time zone information and daylight saving time are not usually part of the locale settings.
Less usual is the input format setting, which is mostly defined on a per application basis.

== Programming and markup language support ==
In these environments,
* C
* C++
* Eiffel
* Java
* .NET Framework
* REBOL
* Ruby
* Perl
* PHP
* Python
* XML
* JSP
* JavaScript

and other (nowadays) Unicode-based environments, they are defined in a format similar to BCP 47. They are usually defined with just ISO 639 (language) and ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 (2-letter country) codes.

== International standards ==

In standard C and C++, locale is defined in &quot;categories&quot; of (text collation), (character class), (currency format), (number format), and (time format). The special category can be used to set all locale settings.

There is no standard locale names associated with C and C++ standards besides a &quot;minimal locale&quot; name &quot;C&quot;, although the POSIX format is a commonly-used baseline.

=== POSIX platforms ===

On POSIX platforms such as Unix, Linux and others, locale identifiers are defined in a way similar to the BCP 47 definition of language tags, but the locale variant modifier is defined differently, and the character set is optionally included as a part of the identifier. The POSIX or &quot;XPG&quot; format is . (For example, Australian English using the UTF-8 encoding is .) Separately, ISO/IEC 15897 describes a different form, , though it&#x27;s highly dubious whether it is used at all.
In the next example there is an output of command codice_1 for Czech language (cs), Czech Republic (CZ) with explicit UTF-8 encoding:

 $ locale
 LANG=cs_CZ.UTF-8
 LC_CTYPE=&quot;cs_CZ.UTF-8&quot;
 LC_NUMERIC=&quot;cs_CZ.UTF-8&quot;
 LC_TIME=&quot;cs_CZ.UTF-8&quot;
 LC_COLLATE=&quot;cs_CZ.UTF-8&quot;
 LC_MONETARY=&quot;cs_CZ.UTF-8&quot;
 LC_MESSAGES=&quot;cs_CZ.UTF-8&quot;
 LC_PAPER=&quot;cs_CZ.UTF-8&quot;
 LC_NAME=&quot;cs_CZ.UTF-8&quot;
 LC_ADDRESS=&quot;cs_CZ.UTF-8&quot;
 LC_TELEPHONE=&quot;cs_CZ.UTF-8&quot;
 LC_MEASUREMENT=&quot;cs_CZ.UTF-8&quot;
 LC_IDENTIFICATION=&quot;cs_CZ.UTF-8&quot;
 LC_ALL=

== Specifics for Microsoft platforms ==

Windows uses specific language and territory strings.
The &quot;locale identifier&quot; (LCID) for unmanaged code on Microsoft Windows is a number such as 1033 for English (United States), or 2057 for English (United Kingdom), or 1041 for Japanese (Japan). These numbers consist of a language code (lower 10 bits) and a culture code (upper bits), and are therefore often written in hexadecimal notation, such as 0x0409, 0x0809 or 0x0411.
Microsoft is starting to introduce managed code application programming interfaces (APIs) for .NET that use this format. One of the first to be generally released is a function to mitigate issues with internationalized domain names, but more are in Windows Vista Beta 1.

Starting with Windows Vista, new functions that use BCP 47 locale names have been introduced to replace nearly all LCID-based APIs.

A POSIX-like locale name format of is available in the UCRT (Universal C Run Time) of Windows 10 and 11.

<doc id="371703" wikidata="Q5455479" url="?curid=371703" title="Fitness proportionate selection">
<text>Fitness proportionate selection, also known as roulette wheel selection or spinning wheel selection, is a selection technique used in evolutionary algorithms for selecting potentially useful solutions for recombination.

== Method ==
In fitness proportionate selection, as in all selection methods, the fitness function assigns a fitness to possible solutions or chromosomes. This fitness level is used to associate a probability of selection with each individual chromosome. If formula_1 is the fitness of individual formula_2 in the population, its probability of being selected is 
: formula_3 
where formula_4 is the number of individuals in the population.

This could be imagined similar to a Roulette wheel in a casino. Usually a proportion of the wheel is assigned to each of the possible selections based on their fitness value. This could be achieved by dividing the fitness of a selection by the total fitness of all the selections, thereby normalizing them to 1. Then a random selection is made similar to how the roulette wheel is rotated.

While candidate solutions with a higher fitness will be less likely to be eliminated, there is still a chance that they may be eliminated because their probability of selection is less than 1 (or 100%). Contrast this with a less sophisticated selection algorithm, such as truncation selection, which will eliminate a fixed percentage of the weakest candidates. With fitness proportionate selection there is a chance some weaker solutions may survive the selection process. This is because even though the probability that the weaker solutions will survive is low, it is not zero which means it is still possible they will survive; this is an advantage, because there is a chance that even weak solutions may have some features or characteristics which could prove useful following the recombination process.

The analogy to a roulette wheel can be envisaged by imagining a roulette wheel in which each candidate solution represents a pocket on the wheel; the size of the pockets are proportionate to the probability of selection of the solution. Selecting N chromosomes from the population is equivalent to playing N games on the roulette wheel, as each candidate is drawn independently.

The naive implementation is carried out by first generating the cumulative probability distribution (CDF) over the list of individuals using a probability proportional to the fitness of the individual. A uniform random number from the range [0,1) is chosen and the inverse of the CDF for that number gives an individual. This corresponds to the roulette ball falling in the bin of an individual with a probability proportional to its width. The &quot;bin&quot; corresponding to the inverse of the uniform random number can be found most quickly by using a binary search over the elements of the CDF. It takes in the O(log n) time to choose an individual. A faster alternative that generates individuals in O(1) time will be to use the alias method.

In 2011, a very simple algorithm was introduced that is based on &quot;stochastic acceptance&quot;. The algorithm randomly selects an individual (say formula_2) and accepts the selection with probability formula_6, where formula_7 is the maximum fitness in the population. Certain analysis indicates that the stochastic acceptance version has a considerably better performance than versions based on linear or binary search, especially in applications where fitness values might change during the run. While the behavior of this algorithm is typically fast, some fitness distributions (such as exponential distributions) may require formula_8 iterations in the worst case. This algorithm also requires more random numbers than binary search.

==Pseudocode==
For example, if you have a population with fitnesses [1, 2, 3, 4], then the sum is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10). Therefore, you would want the probabilities or chances to be [1/10, 2/10, 3/10, 4/10] or [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]. If you were to visually normalize this between 0.0 and 1.0, it would be grouped like below with [red = 1/10, green = 2/10, blue = 3/10, black = 4/10]:
 0.1 ]
 0.2 \
 0.3 /
 0.4 \
 0.5 |
 0.6 /
 0.7 \
 0.8 |
 0.9 |
 1.0 /

Using the above example numbers, this is how to determine the probabilities:

 sum_of_fitness = 10
 previous_probability = 0.0
 [1] = previous_probability + (fitness / sum_of_fitness) = 0.0 + (1 / 10) = 0.1
 previous_probability = 0.1
 [2] = previous_probability + (fitness / sum_of_fitness) = 0.1 + (2 / 10) = 0.3
 previous_probability = 0.3
 [3] = previous_probability + (fitness / sum_of_fitness) = 0.3 + (3 / 10) = 0.6
 previous_probability = 0.6
 [4] = previous_probability + (fitness / sum_of_fitness) = 0.6 + (4 / 10) = 1.0

The last index should always be 1.0 or close to it. Then this is how to randomly select an individual:

 random_number # Between 0.0 and 1.0
 if random_number &lt; 0.1
 select 1
 else if random_number &lt; 0.3 # 0.3 − 0.1 = 0.2 probability
 select 2
 else if random_number &lt; 0.6 # 0.6 − 0.3 = 0.3 probability
 select 3
 else if random_number &lt; 1.0 # 1.0 − 0.6 = 0.4 probability
 select 4
 end if

== Other methods ==
Other selection techniques, such as stochastic universal sampling or tournament selection, are often used in practice. This is because they have less stochastic noise, or are fast, easy to implement and have a constant selection pressure.

<doc id="371707" wikidata="Q2656780" url="?curid=371707" title="Hon'inbō Sansa">
<text>Hon&#x27;inbō Sansa (本因坊 算砂, 1559 – June 13, 1623) was the assumed name of Kanō Yosaburō (加納 與三郎), one of the strongest Japanese Go players of the Edo period (1603–1867), and founder of the house of Hon&#x27;inbō, first among the four great schools of Go in Japan. He was a Buddhist priest of the Nichiren sect, and his original dharma name was Nikkai (日海).

==Life and career==
Nikkai was born in Kyōto and became a monk at age nine. The name &quot;Hon&#x27;inbō&quot;, (originally pronounced &quot;Honninbō&quot;), comes from a sub-temple of the Jakkōji temple complex in Kyōto where Nikkai, the first &quot;Hon&#x27;inbō&quot;, resided.

Among his students were the &quot;daimyōs&quot; Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu, the three great &quot;unifiers&quot; of feudal Japan. Nikkai considered the three generals to be &quot;fifth-degree&quot; players (五子, comparable to amateur 4 or 5 dan), but &quot;diplomacy&quot; was likely a factor in Nikkai&#x27;s even-handed assessment of these imposing figures.

It was Nobunaga who, in 1578, recognized twenty-year-old Nikkai as the first &quot;Meijin&quot; of Go. In 1582, Nikkai, at the behest of Nobunaga, was involved in a notorious game at the Honnōji Temple against his rival, another Nichiren priest, Kashio Rigen (鹿塩 利玄 b. 1565). (Apparently, there is a theory that &quot;Kashio&quot; and &quot;Rigen&quot; were two different people. See the Japanese version of this article.) The game is traditionally held to have taken place on the eve of the treacherous Incident at Honnōji, (in which Nobunaga was forced to commit seppuku), and is said to have ended in a &quot;triple ko&quot;. Hence the notion of triple ko as bad omen. There is a go game record, but typical for the period, it is incomplete. The triple ko may have occurred, somewhat implausibly, in unrecorded remaining plays, or in another game that day, but in the end, there is no evidence that this is more than a good story.

In 1587, Nobunaga&#x27;s successor, the regent (&quot;kampaku&quot;) Hideyoshi gave Nikkai an official position, (forerunner to the office of &quot;Go-dokoro&quot;), granting his temple an annual four &quot;koku&quot; of rice and setting up a tournament that he attended in person. In 1592, Nikkai was given the rank of &quot;Gon-no-Daisoku&quot; by the Go-Yōzei Emperor.

In 1603, the Go-Yōzei Emperor recognized sixty-year-old Tokugawa Ieyasu as &quot;shōgun&quot;, inaugurating the 250-year rule of the Tokugawa bakufu. At the direction of Ieyasu, Nikkai turned priestly duties at Jakkoji over to his younger brother Nichiei and became the first &quot;go-dokoro&quot;, in which office Nikkai was provided fifty &quot;koku&quot; of rice and five servants. Also around this time (), Nikkai took the name &quot;Hon&#x27;inbō Sansa&quot; (&quot;Sansa&quot; written 算砂: the characters for &quot;calculating&quot; and &quot;sand&quot;).

Sansa was also a strong &quot;shogi&quot; player, but in the Tokugawa period, go was organised into four &quot;houses&quot; (or &quot;academies&quot;), and shogi into three, which would compete in &quot;oshirogo&quot; &quot;Castle Go&quot; (and &quot;Castle shogi&quot;) tournaments for the title &quot;Meijin&quot;. (See more at &quot;History of shogi § Modern shogi&quot;.) The official nature of these arrangements meant that go and shogi masters held different offices. In 1612, eight go and shogi players were given individual state support. This system persisted over two and a half centuries, until the collapse of the Tokugawa government itself in the Meiji Restoration.

The beginning of the &quot;oshirogo&quot; matches in Edo, seat of the Tokugawa government, meant that at the end of each year, Sansa had to travel east for a month. He is said to have turned down an official residence in Edo&#x27;s early Nihonbashi district, but was given other accommodations. (It was the unrivaled fourth Hon&#x27;inbō, Hon&#x27;inbō Dōsaku (1645–1702) who finally moved the school to Edo.) Sansa died in Edo at the age of 65.

==Legacy==
Honinbō Sansa was succeeded by a youth named Sugimura, who due to his age, had to wait several years after Sansa&#x27;s death to re-establish the Hon&#x27;inbō house as Hon&#x27;inbō San&#x27;etsu when he turned twenty. However, the title of &quot;Meijin&quot; was regained by the third head of Hon&#x27;inbō, and altogether, seven of the ten generations of historic &quot;Meijin&quot; were Hon&#x27;inbō. In addition, all three traditional &quot;Kisei&quot; (&quot;Go Sages&quot;) were Hon&#x27;inbō masters. (Both &quot;Meijin&quot; and &quot;Kisei&quot; are now titles administered by the Nihon Ki-in.)

The school established by Hon&#x27;inbō Sansa, along with the Inoue and Yasui schools, lasted into the 20th century, but struggled without government backing. In 1936, the last Hon&#x27;inbō master, the controversial Hon&#x27;inbō Shūsai, turned selection of the Hon&#x27;inbō title over to the Nihon Ki-in. (See Honinbō Tournament.)

==In popular culture==
He has been featured in the Japanese manga Hikaru no Go.

<doc id="371708" wikidata="Q1187093" url="?curid=371708" title="Research Triangle Park">
<text>Research Triangle Park (RTP) is the largest research park in the United States; it occupies in North Carolina and hosts more than 300 companies and 65,000 workers. It is owned and managed by the Research Triangle Foundation, a private non-profit organization. 

North Carolina&#x27;s Research Triangle region is named for the facility, which sits within the geographic triangle formed by three nearby research universities: North Carolina State University, Duke University, and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 

The park is bounded by the cities of Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill and the communities of Morrisville and Cary. Most of its territory lies within Durham County, with about one-quarter in Wake County.

==Overview==
Research Triangle Park is one of the most prominent high-tech research and development parks in the United States. It was created in 1959 by state and local governments, nearby universities, and local business interests. Karl Robbins bought the land where the park is now built.
The park covers and is situated in a pine forest with of built space. The park is traversed by Interstate 40, the Durham Freeway, and NC 540.

The park is home to more than 300 companies that employ 55,000 workers and an additional 10,000 contractors.

IBM has long been among the largest corporate tenants at RTP, with a four-building complex totaling 774,000 square feet. The park hosts one of GlaxoSmithKline&#x27;s largest R&amp;D centers with about 5,000 employees. Cisco Systems&#x27; campus in the park, with about 5,000 employees, is its second-largest location, after its Silicon Valley corporate headquarters. The National Institutes of Health has its National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in the park and the city of Durham.

In August 2017, Scott Levitan was named the foundation&#x27;s new president and CEO, making him the 9th leader since the foundation was established.

== History ==

After World War II, North Carolina&#x27;s economy was hurt as its agriculture, textile, and furniture industries lost market share. Academics at UNC, NCSU and Duke proposed a park to allow the universities to do research together, harness the area&#x27;s strengths, and keep graduates in the state. 

The &quot;Research Triangle&quot; name is first known to have been used by Romeo Guest in 1953. Guest began advocating the project after unsuccessfully attempting to bring pharmaceutical giant Merck to Aberdeen, North Carolina, in the early 1940s. The project was officially greenlit by Governor Luther Hodges in 1956, but the three universities were initially wary of the initiative.

Although RTP was initially envisioned as a for-profit business, its strategy shifted at the direction of Archibald &quot;Archie&quot; Davis, a former Wachovia Bank chairman, state senator, and president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, who switched to a non-profit model to purchase the RTP site, and successfully raised $1.425 million in donations from North Carolinians. 

The surge in RTP&#x27;s growth began in 1965, when IBM and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare announced new facilities in the park. The latter move was attributed to the efforts of Governor Terry Sanford, an ally of President John F. Kennedy. From then until the late 2000s, the park averaged six new companies and 1,800 new employees per year.

IBM remained the largest employer at RTP for decades, with 11,000 workers at the site as of 2013. The RTP facility handled products including the IBM 1050 terminal, Selectric typewriters, PC and accounting operations, and BladeCenter servers.

In 1976, the three major area universities formed a consortium, the Triangle Universities Center for Advanced Studies (TUCASI), to develop joint research facilities and think tanks at RTP. This led to the foundation of the National Humanities Center, Microelectronics Center of North Carolina, the North Carolina Biotechnology Center, and the National Institute for Statistical Sciences.

In their article &quot;The Growth of Research Triangle Park&quot;, Link and Scott posit that entrepreneurial culture and leadership contributed the most to its success as a cluster. Archie Davis promoted a culture of innovation and entrepreneurship by locating the park near universities, actively recruiting organizations (like the American Academy of Arts and Sciences), and used his vision to raise funding for the park.

Davis strongly believed that profits could not be the only driver for creating the park and that the betterment of the community should be the key goal. &quot;The love of this state … was the motivation for the Research Triangle idea,&quot; he said. &quot;Research Triangle is a manifestation of what North Carolina is all about.&quot; Research Triangle Park remains a nonprofit.
==Local government==
The park is an unincorporated area, and state law prohibits municipalities from annexing areas within the park. Some local government functions are served by the Durham-Wake Counties Research and Production Service District, a special tax district created in 1986 that is conterminous with the park, wherein the property tax rate is limited to 10 cents per $100 valuation. The park has special zoning as a Research Applications District in the Wake County portion, and a Scientific Research Park in the Durham County portion. As of October 2012, both zoning areas are in the process of being revised to allow higher density development. The zoning changes are coupled with legislative changes allowing for Urban Research Service Districts (URSD) within the Park, which can include a mix of retail and residential usages. The URSDs have the power to levy taxes at the same rate as a neighboring city.

The Research Triangle Foundation operates several subsidiaries within the park. These include: the Frontier RTP startup campus, Boxyard RTP, and Hub RTP. Frontier RTP first opened as a free coworking space in a single building in January 2015. Since its inception, the Foundation has expanded the Frontier RTP concept to three additional buildings, creating an affordable campus for growing tech, life science and nonprofit organizations; as of 2021, 100 of the Park&#x27;s 300 companies are housed in the Frontier campus.

==Redevelopment==
On October 1, 2015, former President and CEO of the Research Triangle Foundation, Bob Geolas, announced RTP&#x27;s plans for a $50,000,000 redevelopment involving the formation of &quot;Park Center&quot;. $20,000,000 will be allocated from Durham County, $10,000,000 from the Durham-Wake Counties Research and Production Service District, and $20,000,000 as a result of land purchases and site work provided by the Research Triangle Foundation of North Carolina. The redevelopment plans also include exploring partnerships with regional transit groups. The hope of the Research Triangle Foundation is to broaden public transportation to and from the area.

=== Hub RTP ===
In 2019, the Research Triangle Foundation announced to &quot;Hub RTP&quot;. The site broke ground in September 2020 and will include 125,000 SF of office over retail, 1,200 residential apartments, of green space, at least one hotel, and 1M SF of the first high rise office towers in RTP.

=== Boxyard RTP ===
In March 2019, RTF announced plans to construct Boxyard RTP, an 15,000-square-foot shipping container complex of retail, dining, and other amenities. The $9M project, which is set on of the Frontier RTP campus, delayed its launch for a year because of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and soft-launched in June 2021 with a few of the planned tenants opening for business in the days following. The complex held its grand opening on November 18, 2021, with several anchor tenants open for business. Initial tenants include restaurants, a brewery, a cocktail bar, a coffee shop, a beauty shop, a CBD vendor, and an escape room. The complex also features a dog park named the Barkyard RTP, pop-up yoga classes, live music, and both standalone and roof-mounted heaters in the outdoor pavilion. Boxyard RTP is inspired by a similar development called The Boxyard Tulsa, located in downtown Tulsa&#x27;s East Village district.

<doc id="371709" wikidata="Q629399" url="?curid=371709" title="Genetic operator">
<text>A genetic operator is an operator used in evolutionary algorithms (EA) to guide the algorithm towards a solution to a given problem. There are three main types of operators (mutation, crossover and selection), which must work in conjunction with one another in order for the algorithm to be successful. Genetic operators are used to create and maintain genetic diversity (mutation operator), combine existing solutions (also known as chromosomes) into new solutions (crossover) and select between solutions (selection). 

The classic representatives of evolutionary algorithms include genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, genetic programming and evolutionary programming. In his book discussing the use of genetic programming for the optimization of complex problems, computer scientist John Koza has also identified an &#x27;inversion&#x27; or &#x27;permutation&#x27; operator; however, the effectiveness of this operator has never been conclusively demonstrated and this operator is rarely discussed in the field of genetic programming. For combinatorial problems, however, these and other operators tailored to permutations are frequently used by other EAs.

Mutation (or mutation-like) operators are said to be &quot;unary&quot; operators, as they only operate on one chromosome at a time. In contrast, crossover operators are said to be &quot;binary&quot; operators, as they operate on two chromosomes at a time, combining two existing chromosomes into one new chromosome.

==Operators==
Genetic variation is a necessity for the process of evolution. Genetic operators used in evolutionary algorithms are analogous to those in the natural world: survival of the fittest, or selection; reproduction (crossover, also called recombination); and mutation.

===Selection===

Selection operators give preference to better candidate solutions (chromosomes), allowing them to pass on their &#x27;genes&#x27; to the next generation (iteration) of the algorithm. The best solutions are determined using some form of objective function (also known as a &#x27;fitness function&#x27; in evolutionary algorithms), before being passed to the crossover operator. Different methods for choosing the best solutions exist, for example, fitness proportionate selection and tournament selection. A further or the same selection operator is used to determine the individuals for beeing selected to form the next parental generation. The selection operator may also ensure that the best solution(s) from the current generation always become(s) a member of the next generation without being altered; this is known as &quot;elitism&quot; or &quot;elitist selection&quot;.

===Crossover===

Crossover is the process of taking more than one parent solutions (chromosomes) and producing a child solution from them. By recombining portions of good solutions, the evolutionary algorithm is more likely to create a better solution. As with selection, there are a number of different methods for combining the parent solutions, including the &quot;edge recombination operator&quot; (ERO) and the &#x27;cut and splice crossover&#x27; and &#x27;uniform crossover&#x27; methods. The crossover method is often chosen to closely match the chromosome&#x27;s representation of the solution; this may become particularly important when variables are grouped together as building blocks, which might be disrupted by a non-respectful crossover operator. Similarly, crossover methods may be particularly suited to certain problems; the ERO is considered a good option for solving the travelling salesman problem.

===Mutation===

The mutation operator encourages genetic diversity amongst solutions and attempts to prevent the evolutionary algorithm converging to a local minimum by stopping the solutions becoming too close to one another. In mutating the current pool of solutions, a given solution may change between slightly and entirely from the previous solution. By mutating the solutions, an evolutionary algorithm can reach an improved solution solely through the mutation operator. Again, different methods of mutation may be used; these range from a simple &quot;bit mutation&quot; (flipping random bits in a binary string chromosome with some low probability) to more complex mutation methods in which genes in the solution are changed, for example by adding a random value from the Gaussian distribution to the current gene value. As with the crossover operator, the mutation method is usually chosen to match the representation of the solution within the chromosome.

==Combining operators==
While each operator acts to improve the solutions produced by the evolutionary algorithm working individually, the operators must work in conjunction with each other for the algorithm to be successful in finding a good solution. Using the selection operator on its own will tend to fill the solution population with copies of the best solution from the population. If the selection and crossover operators are used without the mutation operator, the algorithm will tend to converge to a local minimum, that is, a good but sub-optimal solution to the problem. Using the mutation operator on its own leads to a random walk through the search space. Only by using all three operators together can the evolutionary algorithm become a noise-tolerant global search algorithm, yielding good solutions to the problem at hand.

<doc id="371710" wikidata="Q5299583" url="?curid=371710" title="Double-barreled cannon">
<text>The double-barreled cannon is an American Civil War-era experimental weapon and is now a modern landmark located in Athens, Georgia. While originally built for warfare, the cannon never saw battle. It is part of the Downtown Athens Historic District, in the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==

===Concept===
This concept dates from 1642 and Florentine gun maker Antonio Petrini. He cast the first cannon with the intention of simultaneously firing two balls linked by a chain from side-by-side barrels, which were meant to scythe down enemy soldiers like standing wheat when it reached them. For the cannon to work, the powder behind each round shot had to ignite at the same instant, which rarely happened.

In 1862, Georgia dentist, builder, and mechanic John Gilleland raised money from a coterie of Confederate citizens in Athens, Georgia to build the chain-shot gun for a cost of $350. Cast in one piece, the gun featured side-by-side bores, each a little over 3 inches in diameter and splayed slightly outward so the shots would diverge and stretch the chain taut. The two barrels have a divergence of 3 degrees, and the cannon was designed to shoot simultaneously two cannonballs connected with a chain to &quot;mow down the enemy somewhat as a scythe cuts wheat&quot;. During tests, the Gilleland cannon effectively mowed down trees, tore up a cornfield, knocked down a chimney, and killed a cow. These experiments took place along Newton Bridge Road northwest of downtown Athens. None of the previously mentioned items were anywhere near the gun&#x27;s intended target.

A treatise that describes Antonio Petrini&#x27;s cannon survives in the Royal Armories of the Tower of London, while Gilleland&#x27;s gun sits on the lawn of the Athens, Georgia, city hall.

===Execution===
Gilleland&#x27;s invention was a failure. When it was first tested on 22 April 1862, it was aimed at a target of two upright poles. Uneven combustion of the powder and casting imperfections in the barrels gave the connected balls a spinning movement in an off-center direction, with witnesses reporting that on its first firing it &quot;plowed up about an acre of ground, tore up a cornfield, mowed down saplings, and then the chain broke, the two balls going in different directions&quot;.

On its second firing, the chain shot across the horizon and into a thicket of pine. &quot;[The] thicket of young pines at which it was aimed looked as if a narrow cyclone or a giant mowing machine had passed through,&quot; reported another witness.

On its third firing, the chain snapped immediately and one ball tore into a nearby cabin, knocking down its chimney; the other spun off erratically and struck a nearby cow, killing it instantly.
Gilleland considered the test-firings a success.

===Civil War use===

Gilleland tried to promote his invention to the Confederate States Army&#x27;s arsenal in Augusta, Georgia, where it was found unfit for its purpose. He continued to try to promote his invention to other military leaders around Augusta, but failed to interest anyone. Finally his contraption was used as a signal gun in Athens to warn the citizens about an invasion by the Union Army.

On 27 July 1864, the cannon was fired after a report was heard of several thousand Union soldiers approaching nearby Monroe, Georgia. However, this report turned out to be false. The cannon disappeared in 1891 and was found in a junkshop some years later.

==Modern use==
Currently, the cannon is on display on the front lawn of the City Hall of Athens, Georgia, where it is a contributing property of the Downtown Athens Historic District. A local landmark and public curiosity, the cannon is one of the most popular and well-known attractions in the city. It is still pointing northward in a symbolic gesture of defiance against the North it was built to fight.

==Other multi-barreled cannons==

While the cannon preserved at Athens is the most famous double-barreled cannon, it is not the only one. Another notable example was called Elizabeth-Henry, named after Charles I&#x27;s youngest children. It was used by the Cavaliers during the English Civil War, and fired 2-ounce charges. It could also fire grapeshot. The barrels were wrapped in leather to prevent rusting.

Multi-barreled cannons have also been built in India, and an example with six barrels, similar to the ribauldequins of the Middle Ages, has been preserved in the Nehru Scientific Center.

The French army fielded a three barrelled canon during the War of the Spanish Succession.

In Poland, cannons with as many as seven barrels were in use in the 16th century. These were similar to the volley guns and organ battery of the 19th century, but in a larger caliber.

However, these other cannons did not attempt the Athens gun&#x27;s idea of firing a connected round simultaneously from multiple barrels.

In 2012 a slightly modernized version was built, at customer request, by the Gunsmoke gun shop on the reality television series American Guns (Season 2, Ep 8). By using a more modern ignition system than Civil War-era the Gunsmoke crew were able to achieve some success in firing the barrels properly. The gun used in the episode was actually built by Sprik&#x27;s Cannon Works and sold to Gunsmoke for their TV show. The barrel was to be welded together by Sprik&#x27;s Cannon Works, who also did the ignition system for a more accurate discharge of both barrels at the same time.

<text>A &#x27; (; , ; , ), Latinized as &#x27; ( ), was a type of courtesan or prostitute in ancient Greece, who served as an artist, entertainer, and conversationalist in addition to providing sexual service. Custom excluded the wives and daughters of Athenian citizens from the symposium, but this prohibition did not extend to , who were often foreign born and could be highly educated. Other female entertainers made appearances in the otherwise male domain, but joined the male guests in their sexual joking, sometimes evidencing a wide knowledge of literature in their contributions.

==Summary==

Traditionally, historians of ancient Greece have distinguished between and &quot;pornai&quot;, another class of prostitute. In contrast to pornai, who provided sex for numerous clients in brothels or on the street, were thought to have had only a few men as clients at any one time, to have had long-term relationships with them, and to have provided companionship and intellectual stimulation as well as sex. For instance, Charles Seltman wrote in 1953 that &quot;hetaeras were certainly in a very different class, often highly educated women&quot;.

More recently historians have questioned the extent to which there was really a distinction between and pornai. The second edition of the &quot;Oxford Classical Dictionary&quot;, for instance, held that was a euphemism for any kind of prostitute. This position is supported by Konstantinos Kapparis, who holds that Apollodorus&#x27; famous tripartite division of the types of women in the speech Against Neaera (&quot;We have courtesans for pleasure, concubines for the daily tending of the body, and wives in order to beget legitimate children and have a trustworthy guardian of what is at home.&quot;) classes all prostitutes together, under the term .

A third position, advanced by Rebecca Futo Kennedy, suggests that &quot;were not prostitutes or even courtesans&quot;. Instead, she argues, were &quot;elite women ... who participated in sympotic and luxury culture&quot;, just as the masculine form of the wordwas used to refer to groups of elite men at symposia.
Even when the term was used to refer to a specific class of prostitute, though, scholars disagree on what precisely the line of demarcation was. Kurke emphasises that veiled the fact that they were selling sex through the language of gift-exchange, while pornai explicitly commodified sex. Leslie Kurke claims that both and pornai could be slaves or free, and might or might not work for a pimp. Kapparis says that were high-class prostitutes, and cites Dover as pointing to the long-term nature of hetairai&#x27;s relationships with individual men. Miner disagrees with Kurke, claiming that were always free, not slaves.

Along with sexual services, women described as rather than seem to have often been educated, and have provided companionship. According to Kurke, the concept of hetairism was a product of the symposium, where were permitted as sexually available companions of the male party-goers. In Athenaeus&#x27; &quot;Deipnosophistai&quot;, are described as providing &quot;flattering and skillful conversation&quot;: something which is, elsewhere in classical literature, seen as a significant part of the hetaira&#x27;s role. Particularly, &quot;witty&quot; and &quot;refined&quot; were seen as attributes which distinguished from common pornai. Hetairai are likely to have been musically educated, too.

Free could become very wealthy, and control their own finances. However, their careers could be short, and if they did not earn enough to support themselves, they might have been forced to resort to working in brothels, or working as pimps, in order to ensure a continued income as they got older.

==Iconography==
Scholars also disagree about the identification of hetaeras in ancient Greek vase painting. Attributes which might identify hetaeras include nudity, involvement in erotic activity, and the presence of money bags. Working with textiles, depiction on kylixes, and being named in inscriptions have all also been used as evidence that women depicted on vases are hetaeras. However, the reliability of all of these indications has been questioned: for instance nudity in the context of athletics, wedding rituals, or supplication does not necessarily relate to sex work. Some scholars have argued that it is impossible to distinguish hetaeras from other kinds of women, or that some depictions of women are intentionally ambiguous.

<text>The Baptist Union of Wales (Undeb Bedyddwyr Cymru) is a Baptist denomination Wales. It is affiliated with the Free Church Council, Cytûn (Churches Together in Wales), the European Baptist Federation, and the Baptist World Alliance. The headquarters is in Carmarthen.

==History==

The General Baptist minister Hugh Evans was one of the first Baptists to preach in Wales around 1646, in the parishes of Llan-hir, Cefnllys, Nantmel, and Llanddewi Ystradenny, as well as in districts across the upper Wye Valley in Breconshire. In 1649 John Myles (1621–1683) and Thomas Proud led in the formation of a congregation at Ilston, before Myles emigrated to Swansea, Massachusetts, in 1663. Myles and Proud were connected to the Particular Baptists in London. In 1650 three Baptist congregations held the first general meeting of Baptists in Wales. The national union was organized in 1866.

==Membership==

According to a census published by the association in 2023, it claimed 8,105 members and 315 churches.

<doc id="371721" wikidata="Q234009" url="?curid=371721" title="Magadha">
<text>Magadha was a region and kingdom in ancient India, based in the eastern Ganges Plain. It was one of the sixteen Mahajanapadas during the Second Urbanization period. The region was ruled by several dynasties, which overshadowed, conquered, and incorporated the other Mahajanapadas. Magadha played an important role in the development of Jainism and Buddhism, and formed the core of the Maurya Empire (ca. 320–185 BCE).

==Geography==
The territory of the Magadha kingdom proper before its expansion was bounded to the north, west, and east respectively by the Gaṅgā, Son, and Campā rivers, and the eastern spurs of the Vindhya mountains formed its southern border. The territory of the initial Magadha kingdom thus corresponded to the modern-day Patna and Gaya districts of the Indian state of Bihar.

The region of Greater Magadha also included neighbouring regions in the eastern Gangetic plains and had a distinct culture and belief. 

==History==

===Vedic period (semi-legendary) (ca. 1700 BCE-6th cent. BCE)===
====Kikata kingdom====

In the &quot;Atharvaveda&quot; the Maghadas are listed along with the Angas, Gandharis and Mujavats. 

Some scholars have identified the Kīkaṭa tribe—mentioned in the Rigveda (3.53.14) with their ruler Pramaganda—as the forefathers of Magadhas because Kikata is used as synonym for Magadha in the later texts. Like the Magadhas in the Atharvaveda, the Rigveda speaks of the Kikatas as a hostile tribe, living on the borders of Brahmanical India, who did not perform Vedic rituals.

====Brihadratha dynasty====
According to the Puranas, the Brihadratha dynasty was the first ruling dynasty of Magadha.

===Mahajanapada (6th-4th cent. BCE)===

====Second urbanisation====
Much of the Second Urbanisation took place in Greater Magadha from onwards, and it was here that Jainism and Buddhism arose.

==== Haryanka dynasty (544 BCE–413 BCE) ====
There is little certain information available on the early rulers of Magadha. The most important sources are the Buddhist &quot;Pāli Canon&quot;, the &quot;Jain Agamas&quot; and the Hindu &quot;Puranas&quot;. The ancient kingdom of Magadha is also mentioned in the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Based on Jain and Buddhist sources, it appears that Magadha was ruled by the Haryanka dynasty for some 130 years, c. 543 to 413 BCE, although dates are uncertain, and could be significantly later.

Two notable Haryanka dynasty rulers of Magadha were Bimbisara (also known as &quot;Shrenika&quot;) and his son Ajatashatru (also known as &quot;Kunika&quot;), who are mentioned in Buddhist and Jain literature as contemporaries of the Buddha and Mahavira. Later, the throne of Magadha was usurped by Mahapadma Nanda, the founder of the Nanda Dynasty (), which conquered much of north India. The Nanda dynasty was overthrown by Chandragupta Maurya, the founder of the Maurya Empire (–185 BCE).

There is much uncertainty about the succession of kings and the precise chronology of Magadha prior to Mahapadma Nanda; the accounts of various ancient texts (all of which were written many centuries later than the era in question) contradict each other on many points. Furthermore, there is a &quot;Long Chronology&quot; and a contrasting &quot;Short Chronology&quot; preferred by some scholars, an issue that is inextricably linked to the uncertain chronology of the Buddha and Mahavira.
According to historian K. T. S. Sarao, a proponent of the Short Chronology wherein the Buddha&#x27;s lifespan was c.477–397 BCE, it can be estimated that Bimbisara was reigning c.457–405 BCE, and Ajatashatru was reigning c.405–373 BCE.
According to historian John Keay, a proponent of the &quot;Long Chronology,&quot; Bimbisara must have been reigning in the late 5th century BCE, and Ajatashatru in the early 4th century BCE. Keay states that there is great uncertainty about the royal succession after Ajatashatru&#x27;s death, probably because there was a period of &quot;court intrigues and murders,&quot; during which &quot;evidently the throne changed hands frequently, perhaps with more than one incumbent claiming to occupy it at the same time&quot; until Mahapadma Nanda was able to secure the throne.

The core of the kingdom was the area of Bihar south of the Ganges; its first capital was Rajagriha (modern day Rajgir), then Pataliputra (modern Patna). Rajagriha was initially known as &#x27;Girivrijja&#x27; and later came to be known as so during the reign of Ajatashatru. Magadha expanded to include most of Bihar and Bengal with the conquest of Vajjika League and Anga, respectively.

===Expansion (413 BCE-28 BCE)===

====Shaishunaga dynasty (413 BCE–345 BCE)====

====Nanda dynasty (c. 345 BCE–c. 322 BCE)====
====Maurya Empire (322 BCE – 185 BCE)====
====Shunga Empire (185 BCE–73 BCE)====
====Kanva dynasty (73 BCE–28 BCE)====
===Extraneous rule (28 BCE-c.240 CE)===

====Mitra dynasty (Kosambi) ( 1st cent. BCE - 2nd cent. CE)====
====Mahameghavahana dynasty (2nd-3rd cent. CE)====
===Gupta&#x27;s===

====Gupta Empire (c. 240–c. 579)====
====Later Guptas (c. 6th century CE–c. 8th century CE)====
===Later history===

From the 11th century until the late 13th century, a group of Buddhist kings known as the Pithipatis ruled parts of the Magadha region. These kings referred to themselves as &quot;Magadhādipati&quot; which translates to &quot;Lords of Magadha&quot;.

==Buddhism and Jainism==
Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, lived much of his life in the kingdom of Magadha. He attained enlightenment in Bodh Gaya, gave his first sermon in Sarnath and the first Buddhist council was held in Rajgriha.

Several Śramaṇic movements had existed before the 6th century BCE, and these influenced both the āstika and nāstika traditions of Indian philosophy. The Śramaṇa movement gave rise to diverse range of heterodox beliefs, ranging from accepting or denying the concept of soul, atomism, antinomian ethics, materialism, atheism, agnosticism, fatalism to free will, idealization of extreme asceticism to that of family life, strict ahimsa (non-violence) and vegetarianism to the permissibility of violence and meat-eating. Magadha kingdom was the nerve centre of this revolution.

Jainism was revived and re-established after Mahavira, the last and the 24th &quot;Tirthankara&quot;, who synthesised and revived the philosophies and promulgations of the ancient Śramaṇic traditions laid down by the first Jain tirthankara Rishabhanatha millions of years ago. Buddha founded Buddhism which received royal patronage in the kingdom.


According to Indologist Johannes Bronkhorst, the culture of Magadha was in fundamental ways different from the Vedic kingdoms of the Indo-Aryans. According to Bronkhorst, the śramana culture arose in &quot;Greater Magadha,&quot; which was Indo-Aryan, but not Vedic. In this culture, Kshatriyas were placed higher than Brahmins, and it rejected Vedic authority and rituals. He argues for a cultural area termed &quot;Greater Magadha&quot;, defined as roughly the geographical area in which the Buddha and Mahavira lived and taught. 

With regard to the Buddha, this area stretched by and large from Śrāvastī, the capital of Kosala, in the north-west to Rājagṛha, the capital of Magadha, in the south-east&quot;. According to Bronkhorst, &quot;there was indeed a culture of Greater Magadha which remained recognizably distinct from Vedic culture until the time of the grammarian Patañjali (ca. 150 BCE) and beyond&quot;. The Buddhologist Alexander Wynne writes that there is an &quot;overwhelming amount of evidence&quot; to suggest that this rival culture to the Vedic Aryans dominated the eastern Gangetic plain during the early Buddhist period. Orthodox Vedic Brahmins were, therefore, a minority in Magadha during this early period.

The Magadhan religions are termed the sramana traditions and include Jainism, Buddhism and Ājīvika. Buddhism and Jainism were the religions promoted by the early Magadhan kings, such as Srenika, Bimbisara and Ajatashatru, and the Nanda Dynasty (345–321 BCE) that followed was mostly Jain. These Sramana religions did not worship the Vedic deities, instead of practicing some form of asceticism and meditation (jhana) and tending to construct round burial mounds (called stupas in Buddhism). These religions also sought some type of liberation from the cyclic rounds of rebirth and karmic retribution through spiritual knowledge.

===Religious sites in Magadha===

Among the Buddhist sites currently found in the Magadha region include two UNESCO World Heritage Sites such as the Mahabodhi temple at Bodh Gaya and the Nalanda monastery. The Mahabodhi temple is one of the most important places of pilgrimage in the Buddhist world and is said to mark the site where the Buddha attained enlightenment.

==Language==


Beginning in the Theravada commentaries, the Pali language has been identified with Magadhi, the language of the kingdom of Magadha, and this was taken to also be the language that the Buddha used during his life. In the 19th century, the British Orientalist Robert Caesar Childers argued that the true or geographical name of the Pali language was Magadhi Prakrit, and that because &quot;pāḷi&quot; means &quot;line, row, series&quot;, the early Buddhists extended the meaning of the term to mean &quot;a series of books&quot;, so &quot;pāḷibhāsā&quot; means &quot;language of the texts&quot;. Nonetheless, Pali does retain some eastern features that have been referred to as &quot;Māgadhisms&quot;.

Magadhi Prakrit was one of the three dramatic prakrits to emerge following the decline of Sanskrit. It was spoken in Magadha and neighbouring regions and later evolved into modern eastern Indo-Aryan languages like Magahi, Maithili and Bhojpuri.

==Historical figures from Magadha==
Important people from the region of Magadha include:

* Śāriputra — born to a wealthy &quot;Brahmin&quot; in a village located near Rājagaha in Magadha. He is considered the first of the Buddha&#x27;s two chief male disciples, together with Maudgalyāyana.
* Maudgalyāyana — born in the village of Kolita in Magadha. He was one of the Buddha&#x27;s two main disciples. In his youth, he was a spiritual wanderer before meeting the Buddha.
* Mahavira — the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism. Born into a royal kshatriya family in what is now Vaishali district of Bihar. He abandoned all worldly possessions at the age of 30 and became an ascetic. He is considered a slightly older contemporary of the Buddha.

<text>Truncation selection is a selection method in selective breeding and in evolutionary algorithms from computer science, which selects the a certain share of fittest individuals from a population for reproduction in the next generation. 

== Animal and plant breeding ==
In animal and plant breeding, truncation selection is a standard method. Animals are ranked by their phenotypic value on some trait such as milk production, and the top percentage is reproduced. The effects of truncation selection for a continuous trait can be modeled by the standard breeder&#x27;s equation by using heritability and truncated normal distributions. On a binary trait, it can be modeled easily using the liability threshold model. It is considered an easy and efficient method of breeding.

== Computer science ==
In computer science, truncation selection is a selection method used in evolutionary algorithms to select potential candidate solutions for recombination modeled after the breeding method. In truncation selection the candidate solutions are ordered by fitness, and some proportion T% of the top fittest individuals are selected and reproduced randomly. It is used in Muhlenbein&#x27;s breeder genetic algorithm.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Weavers is the most ancient of the Livery Companies in the City of London. It existed in the year 1130, and was perhaps formed earlier. The company received a Royal Charter in 1155. At present, the Company retains a connection to textiles through its contributions to the textile industry. It has, however, like most other Livery Companies, evolved into a charitable institution rather than remaining a trade association.

The Company ranks forty-second in the order of precedence of the Livery Companies. Its motto is &quot;Weave Truth With Trust&quot;.

Members of the Livery elect annually an Upper Bailiff who bears an ancient title unique to the Weavers&#x27; Company, and a Renter Bailiff. Previous Upper Bailiffs have included:
* George Kemp, 1st Baron Rochdale 1926–1927 and 1939–1940
* George Hayter Chubb, 1st Baron Hayter 1931–32
* Sir Henry Birchenough 1934–35
* John Garbutt

<text>The evening grosbeak (Hesperiphona vespertina) is a passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae found in North America.

The evening grosbeak is bulky, with a large bill and short tail. The bird has a distinct appearance, with the adult male featuring a bright yellow forehead and body, brown head, and white wing patches, while the adult female has a mainly olive-brown body with greyer underparts and white wing patches.

The evening grosbeak breeds in coniferous and mixed forests across Canada, the western mountainous areas of the United States, and Mexico. Its migration pattern is variable, sometimes reaching as far south as the southern U.S. in winters. These birds forage in trees and bushes, and their diet mainly consists of seeds, berries, and insects. The bird&#x27;s range has expanded eastward in historical times, likely due to the planting of Manitoba maples and other shrubs near farms and the availability of bird feeders during winter.

==Taxonomy==
The evening grosbeak was formally described in 1825 by the American naturalist William Cooper and given the binomial name &quot;Fringilla vespertina&quot;. Cooper had been sent a specimen by the ethnologist Henry Schoolcraft that had been collected in the evening near Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. Cooper recorded the name of the bird in the Ojibwe language as &quot;Paushkundamo&quot;.

The IOC checklist and the &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot; place the evening grosbeak and the closely related hooded grosbeak in the genus &quot;Hesperiphona&quot;. However, the Clements Checklist and the AOS checklist place the evening and hooded grosbeaks in the genus &quot;Coccothraustes&quot; with the hawfinch.

The genus &quot;Hesperiphona&quot; was introduced by Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1850. The name is from Ancient Greek &quot;hesperos&quot; meaning &quot;evening&quot; and &quot;phōnē&quot; meaning &quot;sound&quot; or &quot;cry&quot;. The specific epithet is from Latin &quot;vespertinus&quot; meaning &quot;of evening&quot;, &quot;of twilight&quot; or &quot;crepuscular&quot;.

Three subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;H. v. vespertina&quot; (Cooper, W, 1825) – central, east Canada and northeast USA
* &quot;H. v. brooksi&quot; Grinnell, 1917 – west Canada and northwest USA
* &quot;H. v. montana&quot; Ridgway, 1874 – southwest USA to southwest Mexico

==Description==
The evening grosbeak is similar in appearance to the Eurasian hawfinch, both being bulky, heavily built finches with large bills and short tails. The evening grosbeak ranges in length from and spans across the wings. In a large sampling of grosbeaks in Pennsylvania during winter, males weighed from , with an average of , while females weighed from , with an average of . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the bill is and the tarsus is . The adult has a short black tail, black wings and a large pale bill. The adult male has a bright yellow forehead and body; its head is brown and there is a large white patch in the wing. The adult female is mainly olive-brown, greyer on the underparts and with white patches in the wings. They also have a loud distinctive &#x27;chew&#x27; call, similar to a glorified house sparrow.

==Breeding and ecology==
The breeding habitat is coniferous and mixed forest across Canada and the western mountainous areas of the United States and Mexico. It is an extremely rare vagrant to the British Isles, with just two records so far. The nest is built on a horizontal branch or in a fork of a tree.

The migration of this bird is variable; in some winters, it may wander as far south as the southern U.S.

These birds forage in trees and bushes, sometimes on the ground. They mainly eat seeds, berries, and insects. Outside of the nesting season they often feed in flocks. Sometimes, they will swallow fine gravel.

The range of this bird has expanded far to the east in historical times, possibly due to plantings of Manitoba maples and other maples and shrubs around farms and the availability of bird feeders in winter.

<text>The Australian of the Year is a national award conferred on an Australian citizen by the National Australia Day Council, a not-for-profit Australian Government-owned social enterprise. Similar awards are also conferred at the state and territory level.

==History==

Since 1960 the award for the Australian of the Year has been bestowed as part of the celebrations surrounding Australia Day, during which time it has grown steadily in significance to become one of the nation&#x27;s pre-eminent awards. The Australian of the Year announcement has become a notable part of the annual Australia Day celebrations. The official announcement has grown to become a public event, and the Canberra ceremony is televised nationally. The award offers an insight into Australian identity, reflecting the nation&#x27;s evolving relationship with world, the role of sport in Australian culture, the impact of multiculturalism, and the special status of Indigenous Australians. It has also provoked spirited debate about the fields of endeavour that are most worthy of public recognition.

The award program promotes active citizenship and seeks to elevate certain people as role models. Three companion awards have been introduced, recognising both Young and Senior Australians, and proclaiming the efforts of those who work at a grass roots level through the &quot;Australia&#x27;s Local Hero&quot; award.

==Sponsorship==
The Australian of the Year award receives substantial sponsorship from private companies, including a relationship in excess of thirty years with the Commonwealth Bank. The close relationship with the Australian Government ensures that the award&#x27;s profile and reputation is significantly enhanced.

==Awards history, by decade==
===1960s===

During the 1960s, a network of state-based organisations worked hard to increase the profile of Australia Day. The most active and best resourced of these was the Victorian Australia Day Council, which had grown out of the Australian Natives&#x27; Association. In January 1960 the council&#x27;s chairman, the unabashed patriot Sir Norman Martin, announced the introduction of a new annual award for the &#x27;Australian of the Year&#x27;. He explained that Australia Day was a fitting occasion on which to give proper recognition to a leading citizen, whose contribution to the nation&#x27;s culture, economy, sciences or arts was particularly outstanding.


For the first two decades the Australian of the Year was chosen by a panel of five, which included the Victorian Premier, the Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne, the vice-chancellor of Melbourne University, the Lord Mayor of Melbourne and the president of the National Council for Women. Although the panel was certainly distinguished, it would in time become too closely associated with Melbourne to be appropriate for a national award. The panel&#x27;s first choice of Nobel Prize winning immunologist Sir Macfarlane Burnet gained general approval. The editors of &quot;The Age&quot; proclaimed the new honour was symptomatic of Australia&#x27;s growing confidence as a nation: &#x27;We are beginning to count for something in the world and we should be intensely proud of this fact.&#x27;

International achievement remained a key criterion during the award&#x27;s first decade. Several sporting heroes were honoured, from America&#x27;s Cup skipper Jock Sturrock and swimmer Dawn Fraser, to world champion motor racer Sir Jack Brabham and boxer Lionel Rose. The pioneering neurologist Sir John Eccles followed Burnet&#x27;s example, becoming the second of five Australians to take out the Nobel Prize/Australian of the Year double. Achievers in the artistic realm were also well represented, including opera singer Joan Sutherland, renowned dancer and choreographer Robert Helpmann and the four members of the chart-topping singing group The Seekers – Judith Durham, Athol Guy, Keith Potger and Bruce Woodley. The focus on international achievement reflected the philosophy of the award organisers, who described the Australian of the Year as &#x27;the person who has brought the greatest honour to Australia in the year under review.&#x27;

===1970s and 1980s===
During its first two decades, the Australian of the Year award grew steadily in national prominence, but it increasingly suffered from its close association with the Victorian Australia Day Council. A competing Australian of the Year award was established by newspaper &quot;The Australian&quot; in 1971. In 1975 the newly formed Canberra Australia Day Council also began to name a rival Australian of the Year. The Canberra council was run by a vibrant group of local inhabitants, who pursued a more progressive agenda than their Victorian counterparts. In particular, the Canberra council was sympathetic to the emerging republican movement, while the Victorian council was staunchly committed to constitutional ties with Britain. The Victorian council also battled a common perception that it was an exclusive organisation that represented the Melbourne Establishment. Australia&#x27;s turbulent political climate nourished this division, and the Australian of the Year award was embroiled in a wider debate about Australian nationalism.

Between 1975 and 1979, the Canberra Australia Day Council named four Australians of the Year. Prime Minister Gough Whitlam lent his support to the Canberra award when he presented the inaugural honour to Major General Alan Stretton, the commander of the emergency response to Cyclone Tracy. The Canberra council also made good use of the federal parliamentary press boxes to promote its award to the national media. The Victorian council was singularly unimpressed that a rival Australia Day organisation had copied its idea – in 1977 it described its own winner, Dame Raigh Roe, as &#x27;the real Australian of the Year&#x27;. The impasse was only resolved when the Fraser government created the National Australia Day Council (NADC) in 1979. The Victorian council willingly transferred responsibility for its award to the new national body, while the Canberra council agreed to discontinue its rival program. In 1982, the Victorian council was further sidelined when that state&#x27;s Australian Labor Party government led by John Cain created a new Victorian Australia Day Committee within the Premier&#x27;s Department, which joined the NADC&#x27;s official national network.

The NADC made immediate changes to the selection process, appointing an independent panel of ten leading Australians from diverse fields. Despite this rigorous approach, the panel&#x27;s first choice of historian Manning Clark did not please conservative politicians, as Clark had been critical of the Fraser government&#x27;s social policy. If nothing else, the controversy was a clear sign that the award had become a prominent and valued feature of the Australia Day celebrations. In time the selection of the annual winner fell to the board of the NADC itself, whose members are appointed by the Prime Minister of the day. Former NADC chairman Phillip Adams recalls that heated debates were common. Typically the Australian of the Year was chosen at a special two-day board meeting, which Adams likened to the election of a Pope: &#x27;We would go into conclave, there would be lots of hot air, then a puff of smoke.&#x27;

&quot;The Australian&quot; has continued to publish its own annual award, which sometimes coincides with the choice of the National Australia Day Council.

During the 1980s, there was an expectation that corporate sponsorship would replace Government funding and that the NADC would become self-sufficient. The list of former Australians of the Year provides circumstantial evidence of this shift towards a more popular imperative. Economist Sir John Crawford and judge Sir Edward Williams thoroughly deserved their awards, but were perhaps not well placed to promote the importance of Australia Day to mainstream Australia, or to secure corporate sponsorship for the NADC. Subsequent winners included marathon runner Robert de Castella, comedian and actor Paul Hogan, singer John Farnham and cricketer Allan Border, who were far more likely to attract public attention. In 1988, the editor of the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; expressed concern at this development: &#x27;One worrying trend with the award is its attachment to ratings. This year&#x27;s candidates appear to have been people who held high public profiles.&#x27; Yet the steadily rising numbers of nominations indicated that the award was capturing the public imagination.

===1990s===
During the 1990s, the Australian of the Year award intersected noticeably with the politics of national identity. In its attempt to encourage unified national celebrations, the NADC was a strong promoter of both multiculturalism and reconciliation. The council was also linked to the growing republican movement and the campaign to change the national flag. Australians of the Year in this period included Yothu Yindi lead singer and prominent Aboriginal identity Mandawuy Yunupingu; environmentalist and republican Ian Kiernan; and Chinese-Australian paediatrician John Yu. Yunupingu&#x27;s award continued a strong tradition of honouring Indigenous Australians. The first Aboriginal winner was boxer Lionel Rose, who quipped: &quot;One hundred and eighty-two years ago one of my mob would have been a dead cert&#x27; for this.&quot; Since then a further seven Indigenous people have been named Australian of the Year, for achievements in sport, music, politics, law, public service and academia. Many have played a role in Indigenous advocacy and some have raised concerns about the celebration of Australia Day on 26 January, most notably the 1985 recipient Lowitja O&#x27;Donoghue.

Prior to 1994 the award was given for the outstanding Australian of the previous year; that is, the 1992 Australian of the Year was announced on Australia Day in 1993. From 1994 onward the award became one for the year ahead, so that the 1994 Australian of the Year was announced on Australia Day in 1994. This resulted in there being no Australian of the Year for 1993.

===2000s onwards===
Debates about the Australian of the Year award often revolve around the relative balance between sport, science and the arts. Fourteen winners have excelled in sports as diverse as cricket, swimming, athletics, sailing, tennis, boxing and motor racing. A recurring criticism that sport features too regularly peaked in 2004, when Steve Waugh was the fourth sporting winner in seven years and the third Test Cricket captain to be honoured. Despite the perception of an over-emphasis on sport, the list of past winners reveals a strong endorsement for scientific achievement; as of 2009 thirteen Australian scientists have received the honour, including ten from the medical sciences. A long-term view also reveals that Australia&#x27;s talented artists have not been neglected; ten winners have excelled in creative pursuits, including six musicians, a dancer, a painter, a comedian and a Nobel Prize-winning novelist.
Many Australians of the Year do not fit neatly into categories such as sport, science and the arts. Phillip Adams once described the past winners as &quot;an eclectic collection of people who reflect the diversity of achievement in this country&quot;. Australians of the Year have also excelled in public administration, the military, social and community work, business enterprise, academia, religious leadership and philanthropy. There has been relatively little public debate about the gender balance of past winners. In 1961 several news outlets incorrectly referred to Sir Macfarlane Burnet as &#x27;Man of the Year&#x27;; the mistake was not allowed to continue, as Joan Sutherland took out the second award, but it is certainly true that women are under-represented. By 2009, 11 winners out of a total of 56 were women.

In 2016, Miranda Devine of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; criticised the selection process, with the national selection panel having to choose from the eight candidates appointed by variously structured, state-based selection panels. Devine also said, &quot;the award, which ought to reflect and unite this great nation, has evolved into a mere plaything of social engineers&quot;, noting also that three of the eight finalists were jointly involved in the same events. Concern has also been raised as to how a person who has not lived in a state &quot;for 40-something years&quot; (Cate McGregor) could be nominated as that state&#x27;s representative. Following criticism of both the award process and the priorities of the 2016 recipient David Morrison, an editorial in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; said, &quot;The Herald knows the selection board will look closely at the 2016 process and work to improve public confidence in the awards in time for a better Australia Day in 2017&quot;.

While the selection of a single Australian of the Year is bound to stimulate debate, the awards program as a whole recognises a much wider range of achievement. In 1979 the NADC named its first &#x27;Young Australian of the Year&#x27;, community service volunteer Julie Sochacki. Twenty years later the veteran country music star Slim Dusty received the inaugural &#x27;Senior Australian of the Year&#x27; award. In 2003 the NADC introduced an award for &#x27;Australia&#x27;s Local Hero&#x27;, which honours outstanding contributions to local communities. With four award categories and a system of state and national finals, the NADC now recognises a total of 128 inspiring Australian role models every year.

==Young Australian of the Year==

For the first twenty years of the Australian of the Year Awards there was no specific honour reserved for younger Australia. This period several young sports stars won the main award, including Dawn Fraser, Shane Gould, Lionel Rose and Evonne Goolagong. Gould remains the youngest person to be named Australian of the Year.

Shortly after the formation of the NADC in October 1979, the Northern Territory representative Ella Stack convinced her fellow board members to introduce a new award that focussed specifically on the achievements of younger Australians. The inaugural winner, youth unemployment worker Julie Sochacki, was named Young Australian of the Year in January 1980. The NADC coordinated the announcement with the Victorian Australia Day Council, which chose the Australian of the Year for the last time. The following year, the NADC assumed responsibility for both awards.

In 1996, at the invitation of Phillip Adams, chairman of the NADC, the Young Australian of the Year Awards was facilitated and coordinated nationally by Awards Australia under the leadership of Jeffrey J Hopp. Hopp and his team ran the awards nationally, working closely with the Australia Day Councils in every state, and NADC Chairmain Kevin Gosper and Lisa Curry until the awards were handed back to the NADC in 2003. 

During that period, the awards recognised, Rebecca Chambers, Nova Peris-Kneebone, Tan Le, Bryan Gaensler, Ian Thorpe, James Fitzpatrick, Scott Hocknull And Lleyton Hewitt.

==Senior Australian of the Year==

The Senior Australian of the Year award initially had no connection with the NADC. When the United Nations declared 1999 the &#x27;International Year of Older Persons,&#x27; the Minister for Aged Care Bronwyn Bishop approached National Seniors Australia with a plan to increase the prominence of the award. The Department of Health and Ageing took over responsibility for the program and Prime Minister John Howard presented the award to veteran country music star Slim Dusty in October 1999. Bishop arranged for the NADC to administer the program on behalf of the Department of Health and Ageing, but the award continued to be presented in October, with no discernible link to Australia Day. Three years later the NADC streamlined its awards programs. The council was running three separate awards, as even the Young Australian of the Year was announced earlier in January and had a separate nominations process. The Senior Australian of the Year announcement moved from October to January (skipping 2002 altogether) and joined the other two awards. By integrating the various programs, the NADC increased the prominence of the companion awards by announcing them at the same function as the Australian of the Year. Since then, many remarkable Senior Australians have been honoured on a national stage on Australia Day Eve.

==Australia&#x27;s Local Hero==

In 2003, the NADC addressed calls to recognise ordinary, lesser-known people who work for the benefit of their fellow citizens, by introducing a fourth award category known as the &quot;Local Hero Award&quot;. The new award was part of a shift in thinking at the NADC towards the key goal of promoting good citizenship.

==Choosing the winners==
The process of choosing the Australian of the Year has evolved considerably over half a century, including both the make-up of the selection committee and the system of nominations. In the 1960s Sir Norman Martin usually insisted that the decision of the small Victorian selection committee was unanimous. If this is true, then it is in stark contrast to the selection process in the 1990s, when Phillip Adams recalls that heated debates were common. In 1980 the NADC had formed an independent panel to decide the award, but eventually the selection fell to the NADC board itself. Typically the matter was considered at a special two-day board meeting, which Adams likened to the election of a new Pope: &#x27;We would go into conclave, there would be lots of hot air, then a puff of smoke.&#x27;

The most significant change in the selection procedure has been expansion of the nomination process. In the 1960s and 1970s, the committee usually chose the winner from a relatively small list of nominees; for example, in 1971 Evonne Goolagong edged out only 18 other nominees. At a meeting in 1982, the directors of the NADC and its state based affiliates identified low nominee numbers as a cause for concern. The problem persisted and board members were regularly encouraged to spread the word and encourage nominations. A public relations report commissioned in 1989 recommended greater community involvement in the nominations process: &#x27;Allow the &quot;ordinary&quot; citizens of Australia a chance to vote for, or in some way have a say in, who should be Australian of the Year.&#x27; During the 1990s glossy brochures calling for nominations were distributed well in advance of the awards deadline.

More recently, the NADC has realised that the nominations process is important not only to the integrity of its various awards, but is also a crucial means of engaging with the Australian community. In 2004 NADC Chair Lisa Curry-Kenny proudly reported that nominations had doubled from the previous year: &#x27;This is a key indication that increasing numbers of Australians of all walks of life are actively engaging with the awards program.&#x27; Public interest in the awards serves a much broader purpose, as NADC Chief Executive Warren Pearson explains: &#x27;The awards program is not primarily about choosing four national recipients; it is about engaging with Australians about citizenship.&#x27; The introduction of the Local Hero award was directed towards this goal, as were various other changes made in 2004. Most importantly, the NADC introduced a new selection process based around state finals. This approach meant a more prominent role for the state-based Australia Day councils and committees, which now oversee the selection of the finalists and host official functions to announce the contenders in November each year. The NADC board now only chooses between the eight state and territory finalists in each category and organises the national announcement in January.

==Statistical profiles==

===Award by category===

===Award by gender===
==Contemporary governance==
The NADC&#x27;s mission statement demonstrates how the awards program fits its wider purpose:

The National Australia Day Council works with and for the people and government of Australia to:

* Unite all Australians through celebration with a focus on Australia Day;
* Promote the meaning of Australia Day through activity, education, reflection, discussion and debate; and
* Promote good citizenship, values and achievement by recognising excellence and service to the communities and the nation.

The third of these aims is predominantly addressed through the Australian of the Year Awards, which offer a high-profile moment for the celebration of outstanding achievement. The awards greatly assist the NADC in its central task, which is aptly summarised by its chief executive Warren Pearson: &#x27;On 26 January each year, the National Australia Day Council encourages Australians to celebrate what&#x27;s great about Australia and being Australian.&#x27;.

==Selection criteria==
There has also been a significant shift in the criteria for the Australian of the Year award in fifty years. Initially the focus was on awarding the person who had &#x27;brought the greatest honour to Australia&#x27;. This emphasis on international acclaim was gradually relaxed and Australian-based achievement was recognised more often from the 1970s onwards. The official criteria have usually been suitably broad in their scope, so changes in approach are largely attributable to the membership of the NADC board and the political climate of the time. In the mid-1980s there was a notable shift towards high-profile winners, while in the 1990s some of those honoured reflected the prominent political issues of republicanism and reconciliation. Currently, the selection committees refer to three main criteria when considering nominees:

* Demonstrated excellence in their field;
* Significant contribution to the Australian community and nation; and
* An inspirational role model for the Australian community.

The third of these criteria supports the NADC&#x27;s key goal of encouraging good citizenship.

==Announcements==

During the 1960s and 1970s, the Australian of the Year award was presented at Melbourne&#x27;s Australia Day Luncheon, which was held in either the Town Hall or the Royale Ballroom. The winner was usually announced about two weeks earlier at a function that provided an opportunity to promote the upcoming Australia Day celebrations. This event was a public relations exercise that attempted to capture the imagination of the media and the nation, but in 1966 a journalist from &quot;The Age&quot; did not follow the script, preferring to poke fun at the stage-managed event:

Since the 1960s, the annual announcement has become progressively more sophisticated. After the NADC took over in 1980 it usually presented the award at an Australia Day concert, which moved around the nation and was often televised. In the 1990s an Australia Day breakfast at Admiralty House in Sydney was the usual venue for the announcement, but more recently the concert has been revived and is held in the national capital.

A highly memorable Australian of the Year function occurred in 1994, when the guest of honour was Charles, Prince of Wales. The Australian of the Year, environmentalist Ian Kiernan, sat on the stage after receiving his award, when a gunshot was heard and an assailant rushed toward Prince Charles. Kiernan jumped to his feet and wrestled the intruder to the ground with the assistance of New South Wales Premier John Fahey. Kiernan later recalled: &#x27;the Premier and I lay on the stage, panting as the adrenaline began to flow, and wondering what to do next.&#x27; As it turned out, the man was armed only with a toy cap pistol, but the incident was a serious security breach and somewhat upstaged Kiernan&#x27;s award.

Since 2004 the award presentation has been held on Australia Day Eve in Canberra. The 32 finalists enjoy an eventful day including morning tea with the Prime Minister at The Lodge, and lunch with the Governor General at Yarralumla. The winners are announced on a specially erected stage in front of Parliament House, witnessed by a crowd of thousands and a national television audience. Specially produced video packages describe the winners in each of the four categories. The scale of the event displays a marked contrast to Sir Norman Martin&#x27;s modest press conferences of the 1960s.

==Medallions and trophies==
The various medallions and trophies that have been presented to the Australians of the Year over fifty years are, in themselves, an interesting insight into changing understandings of what it means to be Australian. Reflecting his lofty ambitions for the new award, Sir Norman Martin announced a &#x27;worldwide competition&#x27; to design the inaugural trophy in 1960. Sir Norman hoped to attract entries from the world&#x27;s finest artists, but the eventual winner was Victor Greenhalgh, the head of the Arts School at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. Greenhalgh designed a bronze medallion, which reflected the prevailing mood as to the importance of Australia Day: its most prominent feature was a likeness of Governor Arthur Phillip, who was described on the medal as &#x27;The Outstanding Australian [of] 1788.&#x27; In 1961. &quot;The Age&quot; reported that Sir Macfarlane Burnet was anxious when a photographer asked him to display the medallion at the awards ceremony: &#x27;The nervous scientist, whose hand with a pipette would be as steady as a rock, fumbled the medal and dropped it under the table.&#x27;

Greenhalgh&#x27;s bronze medallion was presented to winners of the Victorian-based Australian of the Year award for two decades. When the NADC assumed responsibility in 1980, it apparently overlooked the issue of a trophy, so Manning Clark received a framed certificate. For the 1986 award to Dick Smith, the NADC commissioned artist Michael Tracey to produce a more appropriate trophy, which the council described in its journal &quot;Australia Day Update&quot;: &#x27;The trophy, symbolising achievement, incorporates a figure holding the Australian flag. The figure is made from steel and the lettering is in pewter.&#x27; In the bicentenary year Tracey was asked to cast his trophy in bronze instead of steel.

In the early 1990s the NADC commissioned glass sculptor Warren Langley to create a new trophy based on the updated Australia Day logo. NADC chairman Phillip Adams had been criticised for removing the Australian flag from the logo and replacing it with a hand reaching for a star. After Adams resigned his position in 1996, the NADC asked Langley to produce an alternative trophy, which featured a map of Australia.

Melbourne-based artist Kristin McFarlane designed the current Australian of the Year trophy in 2004. Like Langley, McFarlane works with glass, but she is also trained as a graphic designer; she combines both text and images and sets them in kilned glass to produce striking works of art. The task of designing a new trophy prompted McFarlane to think more deeply about national identity than she had before: &#x27;It made me look at Australian identity and think about what was an Australian? Who is the archetypal Australian?&#x27; She quickly realised that an image of one person, or even a group of people, would not work, and that her images needed to be generic. She decided to use a map of Australia: &#x27;It is one of the oldest continents in the world and it is a very recognisable form for anyone who lives here.&#x27; McFarlane also chose to use the text of the Australian national anthem &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;, but gave particularly prominence to the lesser-known second verse.

==Australians of the Year Walk==

The &quot;Australians of the Year Walk&quot; in Canberra was designed by the National Capital Authority and comprises a series of plinths, seats and lighting. Incorporated in the pathway are five metal strips set flush in the concrete, representing the five music stave lines. The plinths are placed in musical note position to the score of the national anthem &quot;Advance Australia Fair&quot;. Fixed to each plinth is an anodised aluminium plaque containing the names and images of an Australian of the Year, there is one plaque for each year of the award. The plaques are arranged chronologically, starting at the western end of the path near Commonwealth Avenue Bridge. The lake side is bordered by white paving stones, the land side by a white paved walkway.

The walk is situated along a straight section of shoreline on Lake Burley Griffin between the National Library of Australia and the Commonwealth Avenue Bridge ().

The walk was opened by the then Prime Minister of Australia John Howard, on Australia Day, 26 January 2006.

In December 2007 journalist Mark McKenna visited the Australian of the Year Walk and interpreted it as a highly symbolic form of national memorial. The empty bollards stretching into the distance particularly intrigued him.
== Australian of the Year Awards as part of Australian society ==
The Australian of the Year Awards represent only one of many ways in which national identity is expressed, but after fifty years they have become a significant part of the ongoing conversation about Australia&#x27;s past, present and future. The awards have also attracted the interest of foreigners, including BBC correspondent Nick Bryant, who recently observed that the awards program &quot;offers an intriguing perspective on the Australian national character, which is both reinforcing and revelatory.&quot;

An ongoing challenge faced by the NADC is that it is hard to represent the diversity of Australian achievement when there is only one winner per category in each year. The ongoing debates about the numbers of winners from the sciences, arts and sport are evidence of this. In the future, these debates might revolve around other issues, including gender balance and ethnic diversity. Awards Director Tam Johnston suggests that the value of the awards program is best measured by consulting the complete list of finalists for each year. In its 2005 Annual Report the NADC included a summary of the 111 finalists honoured nationally, which revealed a remarkable variety of achievement and a diversity of personal backgrounds. Importantly, the NADC has recently devoted attention to promoting the state finals, which emphasises the wide variety of achievement that is recognised each year.

Not all of the debate and discussion generated by the awards program has been of a serious nature. A more light-hearted portrait can be found in the award-winning television satire (2005), in which actor Chris Lilley plays five obscure nominees for the Australian of the Year award. One reviewer suggested that Lilley&#x27;s creation was both a humorous mockumentary and a serious critique of the awards program: &#x27;if you want a show that skewers the nation&#x27;s pretensions and aspirations, while providing laugh-out-loud comedy, this is the real deal.&#x27; All five characters have in one way or another inspired people in their local community, but none of them appears even a remotely suitable choice for Australian of the Year. Although primarily a vehicle for Lilley&#x27;s comic talent, &quot;We Can Be Heroes&quot; is also a biting critique of what we look for in role models. In contrast, the magazine &quot;Eureka Street&quot; offers a strong endorsement of the awards program&#x27;s potential:
The editors of &quot;Eureka Street&quot; suggest that the awards have been successful in achieving one of the core goals of the National Australia Day Council, which is to &quot;promote good citizenship, values and achievement by recognising excellence and service to the communities and the nation&quot;.

<text>Alain Colmerauer (24 January 1941 – 12 May 2017) was a French computer scientist. He was a professor at Aix-Marseille University, and the creator of the logic programming language Prolog.

==Early life==
Alain Colmerauer was born on 24 January 1941 in Carcassonne. He graduated from the Grenoble Institute of Technology, and he earned a PhD from the Ensimag in Grenoble.

==Career==
Colmerauer spent 1967–1970 as assistant professor at the University of Montreal, where he created Q-Systems, one of the earliest linguistic formalisms used in the development of the TAUM-METEO machine translation prototype. Developing Prolog III in 1984, he was one of the main founders of the field of constraint logic programming.

Colmerauer became an associate professor at Aix-Marseille University in Luminy in 1970. He was promoted to full professor in 1979. From 1993 to 1995, he was head of the Laboratoire d&#x27;Informatique de Marseille (LIM), a joint laboratory of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, the Université de Provence and the Université de la Méditerranée. Despite retiring as emeritus professor in 2006, he remained a member of the artificial intelligence taskforce in Luminy.

Colmerauer won an award from the regional council of Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur, and in 1985 the Michel Monpetit Award, from the French Academy of Sciences. In 1986, he was made a knight of the Legion of Honour by the French government. He became Fellow of the American Association for Artificial Intelligence in 1991, and in 1997 the Association for Logic Programming bestowed upon him and fourteen other select researchers the title of &quot;Founder of Logic Programming&quot;. He then received the Association for Constraint Programming&#x27;s Research Excellence Award in 2008. He was also a correspondent of the French Academy of Sciences in the area of mathematics.

==Death==
Colmerauer died on 12 May 2017.

==The ALP Alain Colmerauer Prize==
The &quot;ALP Alain Colmerauer Prize&quot; (in short: &quot;Alain Colmerauer Prize&quot;) is organized by the Association for Logic Programming.
The Prize is given for recent accomplishments and practical advances in Prolog-inspired computing, understood in a broad sense, where foundational, technological, and practical contributions are eligible with proven evidence or potential for the future development of Logic Programming. The award of the inaugural edition of the Prize in 2022, in cooperation with the Prolog Heritage Association, was a highlight of the Year of Prolog celebrating 50 years of Prolog and logic programming.

<text>&quot;Iridescent&quot; is a song by American rock band Linkin Park. It was announced as the band&#x27;s third US, fourth international and overall final single from their fourth studio album, &quot;A Thousand Suns&quot;, which was released on September 14, 2010. A music video for the song was directed by Joe Hahn, the band&#x27;s turntablist.

&quot;Iridescent&quot; serves as the theme song for the film &quot;&quot;, continuing the streak of the band&#x27;s songs serving as the theme songs of the &quot;Transformers&quot; films, and was remixed in Dolby Surround 7.1 for the movie&#x27;s release.

The song received positive reviews and became a moderate success worldwide.

==Background==

In April 2011, a splash screen appeared on the band&#x27;s website, that contained a distorted Autobot image and a snippet from &quot;Iridescent&quot; (this is no longer available). A few days later, Mike Shinoda, one of the band&#x27;s lead vocalists, confirmed that the song will be the fourth single from &quot;A Thousand Suns&quot;. He also confirmed that a shorter version was made for the film &quot;&quot;, which is circulating around the internet. Shinoda said that the collaboration began when Michael Bay, the director of the film series, phoned him about the possibility of the band continuing their run with songs paired with the Transformers films (having chosen &quot;What I&#x27;ve Done&quot; for the first film and having recorded &quot;New Divide&quot; specifically for the ). Shinoda decided to put &quot;Iridescent&quot; in the film due to the fact it was a fan favorite and called it a &quot;natural fit&quot;, despite the song not being an &quot;in-your-face&quot; kind of tune.

The film&#x27;s composer, Steve Jablonsky, who is a longtime fan of the band, agreed with the choice, saying that the song fit well with his score, as well as the film&#x27;s story. Both Shinoda and Jablonsky agree that the song is an appropriate choice for the film, since the film is described to be more &quot;positive&quot; than the previous films and is consistent with where the band is at (learning from mistakes; going in different directions).

&quot;Iridescent&quot; is a rock ballad about hope in the midst of chaos and sadness. The album version of the song starts segued from the previous track &quot;Wisdom, Justice and Love&quot; as an A minor in piano with Mike Shinoda&#x27;s verses as well, while the chorus are sung in C major and up until the end of the song where it segues to the next track &quot;Fallout&quot;.

Hans Zimmer has collaborated with Steve Jablonsky and Linkin Park to incorporate the song into the film&#x27;s score. It appears multiple times, primarily its synth and piano debut, modified to fit the tone of the scenes in which they are featured.

The first time it is played, Sam discovers Carly has been given a new car. The second time, it appears to be toned down to G minor with the piano as Sam Witwicky regroups with the Autobots. The third time it appears is when Sam gets couple counseling from his parents, though as an A minor. The fourth, when Sam and Epps infiltrate Chicago, was also in A minor with Shinoda&#x27;s vocals. These appearances are marked by the merging of the song&#x27;s theme as well as themes taken from this movie and the two previous ones&#x27; scores.

The final time it is played, it is introduced as the first verse&#x27;s instrumental in A minor and then continues playing in its single edit as the credits roll however the chorus is cut shorter and then proceeds to the &quot;Let it go&quot; bridge.

The single edit is a minute shorter than the album version, this is due to the cutting of parts of the third verse and other parts of the songs. Some instruments&#x27; parts are removed or added for instance, drum beats are added at the beginning which were not present in the album version, the third chorus sung by all six members is cut and directly leads to the bridge &quot;Let it go&quot; and to the fourth final chorus with a part of the piano cut shorter.

Just like their previous single, &quot;Burning in the Skies&quot;, Shinoda sings the verses while lead vocalist Chester Bennington sings the chorus and backup vocals on the verses. On the third chorus of the song, all six band members sing together.

Some LPTVs (behind-the-scenes footage) show the creation and development of &quot;Iridescent&quot;, such as the inclusion of gang vocals in the third chorus of the song and the initial discussion about the song.

In June, Linkin Park held an artwork contest for &quot;Iridescent&quot;, in which the winning artwork was shown in the band&#x27;s stage in their concert at Red Square in Moscow at the premiere of &quot;Transformers: Dark of the Moon&quot;. Artworks were submitted to Linkin Park&#x27;s official deviantArt. They announced the winner on June 23, 2011, however, aside from the aforementioned winner&#x27;s artwork, they also showed the artwork of the contest&#x27;s runner-up at the concert. The winner of the contest was Wan Muhammad Azzim from Melaka, Malaysia. The runner up was Ashkan Harati from Belgium while the other two finalists were Sanja Grbic from Serbia and Matthew Johnson from the United States.

HBO used the song to promote their 2011–12 Fall programming line up and the 2012 films that are featured on the HBO Go App.

==Music video==
The official music video was directed by Joe Hahn, the band&#x27;s turntablist and keyboardist. In an interview with MTV, Mike Shinoda stated: &quot;All I know about the concept is that Joe Hahn sent me an e-mail that said something about &#x27;In the valley of the blind, the one-eyed man is king&#x27;, or something like that. And the next thing I know, I&#x27;ve got horns growing out of my shoulders, and I&#x27;ve got one blind eye, and I&#x27;ve got a white dog and a snake on a throne made of antlers. I think you&#x27;d have to ask Joe what that all means.&quot;
The video&#x27;s concept is based on the saying taken from the short story &quot;The Country of the Blind&quot; by H.G Wells.

In the behind-the-scenes video for &quot;Iridescent&quot;, which was released on May 31, 2011, Hahn stated that he wanted to combine the &quot;soulfulness&quot; of &quot;Transformers: Dark of the Moon&quot; to the soulfulness of what they do, as well as elements of robots tying into human existence. In an extended behind-the-scenes video, which was released on July 11, 2011, it was revealed that Shinoda was required to carry a diamond carpet python.

The video is black and white with small slices of color elements mixed in giving it a sense of actual iridescence with emphasis on Transformers&#x27; characters&#x27; color. The video uses the radio edit of Iridescent, rather than the original on &quot;A Thousand Suns&quot;. In addition to the animated Transformers elements, the video has computer generated elements that call back to the videos for &quot;Waiting for the End&quot; and &quot;Burning in the Skies&quot;.

The music video for &quot;Iridescent&quot; was released on June 3, 2011, on MTV and VH1. The video shows Mike Shinoda as a one-eyed king, with horns sticking out of his shoulders, ruling over the citizens of a post-apocalyptic land. Numerous citizens of the world are wearing ragged clothing, including the other band members. Some scenes also show the band sitting together in a feast, mirroring Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s painting &quot;The Last Supper&quot;. Numerous scenes and stills from &quot;Transformers: Dark of the Moon&quot; are inserted to the video. Hahn stated that &quot;the video explores how human existence might be affected by the elements of Transformers robots and the threat of the Decepticons.&quot;

On June 28, 2011, the band announced that the video can be seen in 3D in select theaters after the film credits of &quot;Transformers: Dark of the Moon&quot;. A day later, the same day the film was released in US and Canada, the 3D video was released online; however, the video has since been made private by the band.

The video peaked at VH1 India&#x27;s Top 50 videos of 2011 at number 5.

As of May 2024, the song has 108 million views on YouTube.

<doc id="371772" wikidata="Q1190809" url="?curid=371772" title="Statute of Rhuddlan">
<text>The Statute of Rhuddlan (), also known as the Statutes of Wales ( or &quot;Valliae&quot;) or as the Statute of Wales ( or &quot;Valliae&quot;), was a royal ordinance by Edward I of England, which gave the constitutional basis for the government of the Principality of Wales from 1284 until 1536. 

The statute followed the Conquest of Wales by Edward I and the killing of the last Welsh prince to rule the whole Principality, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd in 1282. The statute introduced English common law to Wales, but also permitted the continuance of Welsh legal practices within the Principality. The statute also introduced the English shire system to the Principality of Wales. Prior to the statute, the Welsh principalities were ruled by Welsh law and the native Princes of Wales.

==Background==

The Prince of Gwynedd had been recognised by the English Crown as Prince of Wales in 1267, holding his lands with the king of England as his feudal overlord. It was thus that the English interpreted the title of Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Lord of Aberffraw, which was briefly held after his death by his successor Dafydd ap Gruffudd. This meant that when Llywelyn rebelled, the English interpreted it as an act of treason. Accordingly, his lands escheated to the king of England, and Edward I took possession of the Principality of Wales by military conquest from 1282 to 1283. By this means the principality became &quot;united and annexed&quot; to the Crown of England.

Following his conquest Edward I erected four new marcher lordships in northeast Wales: Chirk (Chirkland), Bromfield and Yale (Powys Fadog), Ruthin (Dyffryn Clwyd) and Denbigh (Lordship of Denbigh); and one in South Wales, Cantref Bychan. He restored the principality of Powys Wenwynwyn to Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn who had suffered at the hands of Llewelyn, and he and his successor Owen de la Pole held it as a marcher lordship. Rhys ap Maredudd of Dryslwyn would have been in a similar position in Cantref Mawr, having adhered to the king during Llewelyn&#x27;s rebellion, but he forfeited his lands by rebelling in 1287. A few other minor Welsh nobles submitted in time to retain their lands, but became little more than gentry.

The English Crown already had a means of governing South Wales in the honours of Carmarthen and Cardigan, which went back to 1240. These became counties under the government of the Justiciar of South Wales (or of West Wales), who was based in Carmarthen. The changes of the period made little difference in the substantial swathe of land from Pembrokeshire through South Wales to the Welsh Borders which was already in the hands of the marcher lords. Nor did they alter the administration of the royal lordships of Montgomery and Builth, which retained their existing institutions.

== Statute ==
The statute also divided Wales into administrations of government via shires which were essentially provinces of the English crown. Prior to the statute, the Welsh principalities were ruled by Welsh law and the native Princes of Wales, the last prince to rule the whole Principality being Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, killed in an ambush by the English in 1282.

The statute was not an act of Parliament, but rather a royal ordinance made after careful consideration by Edward I on 3 March 1284. It takes its name from Rhuddlan Castle in Denbighshire where it was first promulgated on 19 March 1284. The Statute was superseded by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542 when Henry VIII made Wales unequivocally part of the &quot;realm of England&quot;. The statute was formally repealed by the Statute Law Revision Act 1887 (50 &amp; 51 Vict. c. 59).

=== Counties ===

The Statute of Rhuddlan was issued from Rhuddlan Castle in North Wales, one of the &quot;iron ring&quot; of fortresses built by Edward I to control his newly conquered lands. It provided the constitutional basis for the government of what was called &quot;The Land of Wales&quot; or &quot;the king&#x27;s lands of Snowdon and his other lands in Wales&quot;, but subsequently called the &quot;Principality of North Wales&quot;. The Statute divided the principality into the counties of Anglesey, Merionethshire, Caernarfonshire, and Flintshire, which were created out of the remnants of the Kingdom of Gwynedd in North Wales. Flintshire was created out of the lordships of Tegeingl, Hopedale, and Maelor Saesneg. It was administered with the Palatinate of Cheshire by the Justiciar of Chester.

The other three counties were overseen by a Justiciar of North Wales and a provincial exchequer at Caernarfon, run by the Chamberlain of North Wales, who accounted to the Exchequer at Westminster for the revenues he collected. Under them were royal officials such as sheriffs, coroners, and bailiffs to collect taxes and administer justice. The king had ordered an inquiry into the rents and other dues to which the princes had been entitled, and these were enforced by the new officials. At the local level, commotes became hundreds, but their customs, boundaries and offices remained largely unchanged.

=== Law ===
The Statute introduced the English common law system to Wales, but the law administered was not precisely the same as in England. The criminal law was much the same, with felonies such as murder, larceny and robbery prosecuted before the justiciar, as in England. The English writs and forms of action, such as novel disseisin, debt and dower, operated, but with oversight from Caernarfon, rather than the distant Westminster. However, the Welsh practice of settling disputes by arbitration was retained. The procedure for debt was in advance of that in England, in that a default judgment could be obtained. In land law, the Welsh practice of partible inheritance continued, but in accordance with English practice:
*Daughters could inherit their father&#x27;s lands if there was no son.
*Widows were entitled to dower in a third of their late husband&#x27;s lands.
*Bastards were excluded from inheriting.

== Building ==

The Parliament House of Edward III in Rhuddlan where it was thought that the Statute of Rhuddlan was promulgated. Thomas Pennant remarks in 1778, &quot;A piece of antient building called the Parlement is still to be seen in Rhuddlan: probably where the king sat in council.&quot; Pennant was to get John Ingleby to provide a watercolour of the building. Today the building still partially stands in Parliament Street, with a late 13th-century doorway and a 14th-century cusped ogee door head.

<text>Abdul Hakim Ali Hashim Murad (; born January 4, 1968) is a Pakistani Islamist terrorist, who was a co-conspirator in the Bojinka plot—the forerunner to the September 11 attacks. In 1996, he was convicted in the United States of trying to blow up a dozen airliners and was sentenced to life in prison.

He was found to have many aliases. A Pakistani passport found had &quot;Abdul Hakim, student, age 26, Pakistani passport No. C665334, issued in Kuwait.&quot; He used the alias Ahmed Saeed when Manila police apprehended him. He was mentioned on Ramzi Yousef&#x27;s laptop personal computer as Obaid.

He was designated by the Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee of the Security Council in 2003.

==Life==
Murad was born in Kuwait, where his father worked as a crane operator for a petroleum company. After graduating from a Kuwaiti high school, he attained his commercial pilot&#x27;s license at the Continental Flying School in the Philippines from November 1990 to January 1991, and continued his studies at the Emirates Flying School in the United Arab Emirates in November 1991.

Ramzi Yousef, a friend of Murad&#x27;s who attended Afghan training camps, taught Murad how to make bombs in Lahore, Pakistan. During one of the practice sessions, a bomb exploded in Yousef&#x27;s face, impairing vision in one eye.

While they were in Metro Manila in the Philippines, Murad and Yousef often went to two karaoke bars, the XO on Adriatico Street, and the Firehouse on Roxas Boulevard in Pasay. According to Murad, they never went to the mosque.
He attended a series of flight schools, including Emirates Flying School in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, the Alpha Tango Flying Service in San Antonio, Texas, and others in Schenectady, New York; New Bern, North Carolina; Louisiana, and Pasay, Philippines. He later told officials he had attended four different American flight schools. On June 8, 1992, he received a Commercial Pilot certificate while at Coastal Aviation Incorporated, after completing 275 hours of required flight time.

==Bojinka plot==

Murad was a co-conspirator with Ramzi Yousef who was one of the main perpetrators and creator of the bomb for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. After moving to the Philippines under the direction of Yousef&#x27;s uncle Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, they planned the unsuccessful Bojinka Plot which would set the pattern for the later Al Qaeda September 11 attacks. The plan involved assassinating Pope John Paul II during a visit to the Philippines then, while attention was drawn to the Pope&#x27;s death, bombs would be placed inside toy cars and planted on airline flights out of Bangkok, killing thousands.

After successfully testing and detonating his deadly bomb on Philippine Airlines Flight 434, Yousef returned to Manila and began preparing at least a dozen bombs each with a higher concentration of explosive materials. But just weeks before the Bojinka Plot was due to be launched, Murad was mixing chemicals which started a fire on January 6, 1995. Yousef and Murad fled the fire, but Murad was sent back to retrieve the laptop computer in the apartment, which contained the plans for the attack. He called himself Ahmed Saeed as he was being arrested. He offered 110,740 Philippine pesos ($2,000 U.S. dollars) to the Manila police if they let him go. Although they did not make that much money in a year, Aida Fariscal, the watch commander, refused to let him go. Police grew suspicious after &quot;Saeed&quot; mumbled that, &quot;two Satans that must be destroyed: the Pope and America.&quot; This led a further search of room 603, where they found a bomb factory and a computer with data relating to the plot.

Over the course of many weeks, his interrogations by Philippine National Police Intelligence consisted of waterboarding, being beaten with chairs and lumber, and having cigarettes extinguished on his penis and testicles. A Philippine National Police raid in another Manila apartment also revealed evidence that Abdul Murad, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Yousef had drawn up plans for flying an airplane into the CIA headquarters. The information was passed on to the FAA who warned individual airlines. As part of the Bojinka plot, Murad was slated to bomb two United Airlines aircraft, and was also slated to be the suicide pilot who would fly a small plane filled with explosives into the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.

Information about plane bombings was sent to the FBI. Abdul Hakim Murad was sent to the United States on April 12, 1995, and would later help convict Yousef based on Murad&#x27;s testimony. Murad was convicted on September 5, 1996, of seven counts of conspiring and attempting to bomb 12 planes. On May 16, 1998, Murad received a life sentence to prison. Murad, Federal Bureau of Prisons #37437-054, is currently serving his time in USP Terre Haute.

<doc id="371778" wikidata="Q8037056" url="?curid=371778" title="Worshipful Company of Joiners and Ceilers">
<text>The Worshipful Company of Joiners and Ceilers is one of the livery companies in the City of London. The Guild of St James Garlickhythe, the company&#x27;s predecessor, named after the church where it was founded, was formed in 1375. The organisation of wood craftsmen, who were known at various times as fusters, carvers, and joiners, received a Royal Charter of incorporation in 1571. The craft of &#x27;ceiling&#x27; refers to the application and installation of both wall and ceiling wood panelling.

The company has traditionally been separate from the Worshipful Company of Carpenters, for historically Joiners attached wood using glue or other similar materials including pins and dowels, while carpenters used nails or pegs. After many years of not fully supporting their original craft ideals, the company is now pursuing a closer link with the training of apprentices both in the craft of Joinery and Ceiling (and carving), It also supports craft-related training institutions, as well as general educational establishments and selected units of the UK armed services.

The company ranks 41st in the order of precedence of the livery companies. Its motto, embraced by John Wilkes, Master of the company in 1770, is &quot;Join Loyalty And Liberty&quot;. The motto prior to formal College of Arms recognition in 1993 was &quot;God Grant Us to Use Justice with Mercy&quot;.

, the company is still operating and functions as a non-profit.

<text>The pine grosbeak (Pinicola enucleator) is a large member of the true finch family, Fringillidae. It is the only species in the genus Pinicola. It is found in coniferous woods across Alaska, the western mountains of the United States, Canada, and in subarctic Fennoscandia and across the Palearctic to Siberia. The species is a frugivore, especially in winter, favoring small fruits, such as rowans (mountain-ashes in the New World). With fruit-crop abundance varying from year to year, pine grosbeak is one of many subarctic-resident bird species that exhibit irruptive behavior. In irruption years, individuals can move long distances in search of suitable food supplies, bringing them farther south and/or downslope than is typical of years with large fruit crops.

==Taxonomy==
The pine grosbeak was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Loxia enucleator&quot;. The type locality is Sweden. It is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Pinicola&quot; that was erected in 1808 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot. The generic name &quot;Pinicola&quot; combines the Latin &quot;pinus&quot; meaning &quot;pine tree&quot; and &quot;colere&quot; meaning &quot;to dwell&quot;; the specific &quot;enucleator&quot; is from the Latin &quot;enucleare&quot; meaning &quot;to remove the kernel&quot;.

The pine grosbeak is a sister taxon to the bullfinches of the genus &quot;Pyrrhula&quot;. The crimson-browed finch (&quot;Carpodacus subhimachalus&quot;) was previously placed in the genus &quot;Pinicola&quot;. It was moved to the rosefinch genus &quot;Carpodacus&quot; based on results from phylogenetic studies of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences that were published in 2012 and 2013.

Eight subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;P. e. enucleator&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – Scandinavia to central Siberia
* &quot;P. e. kamtschatkensis&quot; (Dybowski, 1883) – northeastern Siberia
* &quot;P. e. sakhalinensis&quot; Buturlin, 1915 – Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands, northern Japan
* &quot;P. e. flammula&quot; Homeyer, 1880 – coastal southern Alaska and western Canada
* &quot;P. e. carlottae&quot; Brooks, AC, 1922 – the Queen Charlotte Islands (off western Canada)
* &quot;P. e. montana&quot; Ridgway, 1898 – inland southwestern Canada to west-central U.S.
* &quot;P. e. californica&quot; Price, 1897 – eastern California
* &quot;P. e. leucura&quot; (Müller, PLS, 1776) – inland west, central Alaska to eastern Canada and northern New England (U.S.)

==Description==
This species is one of the largest species in the true finch family. It measures from in length and weighs from , with an average mass of . The pine grosbeak&#x27;s wingspan is 13.0 in (33 cm). Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the bill is and the tarsus is . Adults have a long forked black tail, black wings with white wing bars and a large bill. Adult males have a rose-red head, back and rump, They also possess black wings and tail, with a conical beak. Adult females are olive-yellow on the head and rump and grey on the back and underparts. Young birds have a less contrasting plumage overall, appearing shaggy when they moult their colored head plumage.

Its voice is geographically variable, and includes a whistled &quot;pui pui pui&quot; or &quot;chii-vli&quot;. The song is a short musical warble.

==Distribution and habitat==

Pine grosbeaks breed in the boreal forests of northern Eurasia and North America, and typically either remain resident near their breeding grounds or migrate relatively short distances to the southern extent of boreal forests. During irruptive years, more travel to southern boreal forests and some move further south. In such years in the New World, they can occur well south of their typical winter distribution, which is the northern Great Lakes region and northern New England in the United States. This species is a very rare vagrant to temperate parts of Europe; in all of Germany, for example, not more than 4 individuals per year and often none at all have been recorded since 1980. The birds have also been known to live in coniferous forests, and other woodlands of the sort.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The breeding habitat of the pine grosbeak is coniferous forests. They nest on a horizontal branch or in a fork of a conifer. This bird is a permanent resident through most of its range; in the extreme north or when food sources are scarce, they may migrate farther south. When breeding both sexes develop which they use to store seeds before feeding them to the young.

Pine grosbeaks forage in trees and bushes. They mainly eat seeds, buds, berries, and insects. Outside of the nesting season, they often feed in flocks.

<text>Pyramid Lake is the geographic sink of the basin of the Truckee River, northeast of Reno, Nevada, United States.

Pyramid Lake is the biggest remnant of ancient Lake Lahontan, the inland sea that once covered much of western Nevada. It is approximately long and wide, with a perimeter of , covering acres entirely enclosed within the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe Reservation.

Pyramid Lake is fed by the Truckee River, which is mostly the outflow from Lake Tahoe. The Truckee River enters Pyramid Lake at its southern end. Pyramid Lake is an endorheic lake, with water leaving only by evaporation or sub-surface seepage. The lake has about 10% of the area of the Great Salt Lake, but it has about 25% more volume. The salinity is approximately 1/6 that of sea water. Although clear Lake Tahoe forms the headwaters that drain to Pyramid Lake, the Truckee River delivers more turbid waters to Pyramid Lake after traversing the steep Sierra terrain and collecting moderately high silt-loaded surface runoff.

The north and east sides of the lake have been restricted to the public and non-Tribal members since 2011, when the Tribal Nation made the decision to close these areas due to the desecration of sacred sites. When visiting, it is recommended to take note of the Tribal protocols and restricted areas.

==Name==

In Northern Paiute language it is called Kooyooe (Cui-ui) Panunadu or Kooyooe Pa&#x27;a Panunadu after the cui-ui fish, which helped sustain the populations around the lake. In fact, a major band of Northern Paiute (endonym: Numu) people whose ancestors lived around the lake call themselves the Kooyooe Tukadu, &quot;cui-ui eaters.&quot;

In Washo the name of the lake is Á’waku dáʔaw, meaning &quot;trout lake.&quot;

The English name of the lake, given to it by explorer John C. Frémont, comes from the impressive cone- or pyramid-shaped tufa formations found in the lake and along the shores.

==History==

A remnant of the Pleistocene Lake Lahontan (~ deep), the lake area has long been inhabited by the Paiute, who ancestrally fished the Tui chub, Cui-ui, and Lahontan cutthroat trout from the lake. The Shoshone and Washo also regularly fished in the lake. According to traditional narratives, the Washo specifically were given fishing rights in Pyramid Lake after assisting the Paiutes in defeating a nearby tribe of giants.

Archeological evidence shows that human populations lived in this area between 9500 B.C.E. and 1400 A.D. Excavations have uncovered tools, weapons, clothing, food, and mummified bodies in the area.

John C. Frémont was the first non-indigenous person to map the lake. The name comes from a large rock formation that resembles a bent pyramid.

In the 19th century, two battles were fought near the lake, major actions in the Paiute War. In the 1960s, a marker was placed commemorating these battles.
Because of water diversion beginning in 1905 by Derby Dam through Truckee Canal to Lahontan reservoir, the lake&#x27;s existence was threatened, and the Paiute sued the Department of the Interior. By the mid-1970s, the lake had lost of depth, and according to Paiute fisheries officials, the lake&#x27;s life was seriously under threat. According to documentary filmmaker John Pilger, the irrigation scheme for which water was diverted was an economic failure.

;Chronology
* 1860 – The Pyramid Lake War: Paiute natives and Euro-American settlers clashed.
*1903 – Irrigation diversion of the Truckee via the Derby Dam contributed to the decline and eventual extinction in Pyramid Lake of the Lahontan cutthroat trout, which are now stocked.
* 1936 – The Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe approved their constitution and by-laws.
* 1987 – A water quality model was completed for the Truckee River.

==Geography==
Pyramid Lake is located in southeastern Washoe County in western Nevada. It is in an elongated intermontane basin between the Lake Range on the east, the Virginia Mountains on the west, and the Pah Rah Range on the southwest. The Fox Range and the Smoke Creek Desert lie to the north.

In a parallel basin to the east of the Lake Range is Winnemucca Lake, now a dry lake bed. Prior to the construction of the Derby Dam in 1905, both lake levels stood at near above sea level. Following the dam&#x27;s completion, the water levels dropped to and for Pyramid and Winnemucca, respectively. In 1957, the Pyramid Lake level was at and the dry Winnemucca Lake bed at had been dry since the 1930s.

Pyramid Lake is the largest remnant of ancient Lake Lahontan, which covered much of northwestern Nevada at the end of the last ice age. It was the deepest point of Lake Lahontan, reaching an estimated due to its low level relative to the surrounding basins.

Sutcliffe is on the west shore of Pyramid Lake along State Route 445. Nixon is on the Truckee River to the southeast of the lake on State Route 447.

The largest tufa formation, Anaho Island, is home to a large colony of American white pelicans and is restricted for ecological reasons. Access to the Needles, another spectacular tufa formation at the northern end of the lake, has also been restricted due to recent vandalism.

===The Pyramid===
The Pyramid (), also known as Fremont&#x27;s Pyramid and Pyramid Island, is a small island near the southeastern shore of the lake. It is located approximately northeast of Anaho Island and slightly less than from the community of Sutcliffe. The white band seen to the east of the island is composed of calcium carbonate which came from when the lake was at or near its overflow point.

==Fish==

Major fish species include the Cui-ui lakesucker, which is endemic to Pyramid Lake, the Tui chub and Lahontan cutthroat trout (the world record cutthroat trout was caught in Pyramid Lake). The former is endangered, and the latter is threatened. Both species were critical to the Paiute people in pre-contact times. The Lahontan cutthroat was called &quot;Hoopagaih&quot; by the Paiute people. As they are both obligate freshwater spawners, they rely on sufficient inflow to allow them to run up the Truckee River to spawn, otherwise their eggs will not hatch.

Diversion of the Truckee for irrigation at Derby Dam beginning in 1905 reduced inflow and the lake level to such an extent that stream flow is rarely sufficient for spawning. The Truckee Canal diverts water used to irrigate croplands in Fallon. The dam lacks fish ladders, which prevents upstream spawning. By 1939 the Lahontan cutthroat trout (the &quot;salmon-trout&quot; as described by Frémont) became extinct in Pyramid Lake and its tributaries. They were replaced with hatchery trout from outside the watershed.

However, in 1979 a remnant population of the original Pyramid Lake cutthroat trout was discovered in a small brook on Pilot Peak, on the Nevada/Utah border, by Dr. Robert Behnke of Colorado State University while he was looking for the Bonneville cutthroat trout, another subspecies of the cutthroat trout. The fish were tiny and in poor condition, but Behnke identified the fingerlings as the missing Pyramid Lake variety.

Subsequent DNA testing of a museum specimen has shown his identification to be correct. The fish had been dumped in the creek in the early 20th century. A brood stock was raised at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&#x27;s Lahontan National Fish Hatchery in Gardnerville, Nevada, and a successful reintroduction effort was mounted by the USFWS and the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe. As of 2017, 24 pound Pyramid Lake Lahontan cutthroat trout are again being caught from the Lake&#x27;s waters.

The fish are doing very well, according to the USFWS project head Lisa Heki. The fish have also been placed in California&#x27;s Fallen Leaf Lake, upstream of Pyramid Lake, and elsewhere. Fish populations are now sustained by several tribally-run fish hatcheries and state and federal agencies. The Pyramid Lake Lahontan cutthroat trout is one of the largest inland trout species in the world.

== Climate ==
The following data are for the census-designated place (CDP) of Sutcliffe, NV, located on the shore of Pyramid Lake.
At 8b the hardiness zone of the lake area is the highest in northern Nevada.

==Water quality==
Because of the endangered species present and because the Lake Tahoe Basin comprises the headwaters of the Truckee River, Pyramid Lake has been the focus of several water quality investigations, the most detailed starting in the mid-1980s. Under direction of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a comprehensive dynamic water quality computer model, the DSSAM Model was developed to analyze impacts of a variety of land use and wastewater management decisions throughout the Truckee River Basin. Analytes addressed included nitrogen, reactive phosphate, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen and nine other parameters. Based on the use of the model, some decisions have been influenced to enhance Pyramid Lake water quality and aid the viability of Pyramid Lake biota. Another contaminant of interest is mercury, introduced to Pyramid Lake from the Truckee River. It is suggested that mercury remediation efforts be carefully considered such that methylmercury production is not enhanced.

Salinity increased from , and the pH level is about 9. Temperature ranges between near freezing () to over .
==Media==
Pyramid Lake was used as a stand-in for the Sea of Galilee in the 1965 biblical film, &quot;The Greatest Story Ever Told&quot;. Also, in 1961, part of &quot;The Misfits&quot; was filmed nearby.

<doc id="371785" wikidata="Q435022" url="?curid=371785" title="Jamie Salé">
<text>Jamie Rae Salé (born April 21, 1977) is a Canadian former competitive pair skater. With her former husband David Pelletier, she is the 2002 Olympic Champion and 2001 World Champion. The Olympic gold medals of Salé and Pelletier were shared with the Russian pair Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze after the 2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal.

==Early life==
Salé was born in Calgary, Alberta. She grew up in a bungalow in Red Deer. Her parents divorced when she was young, and she was separated from her brother.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
Salé competed first as a singles skater, winning the novice bronze medal and placing eighth in junior ladies at the Canadian Championships. In 1994, Salé won the short program and finished with the bronze medal in the junior event at the Canadian Championships. That same year, she achieved her biggest success to date by winning the senior bronze medal with her pairs partner, Jason Turner. They were named to the 1994 Canadian Olympic team and placed 12th at the Lillehammer Olympics. They placed 16th at the 1994 World Championships in Chiba, Japan, but ended their partnership that August.

Salé returned to singles skating. She placed fifth at the 1995 Canadian Championships, but struggled with injuries which caused her to withdraw from the 1997 Championships. Salé returned in 1998 and skated a strong short program, but was only able to land one of five planned triples in her long program and placed sixth.

=== Return to pair skating ===
Salé had a tryout with David Pelletier in the summer of 1996, but it did not lead to a partnership. After her moderate success in singles, she decided to give pairs one last shot. Coach Richard Gaulthier, who was helping Pelletier find a partner, suggested Salé. He and Pelletier went to Edmonton in February 1998 to try out with Salé again. &quot;The first time we grabbed hands, it was just great,&quot; said Pelletier, and by the next month Salé had moved to Montréal to skate with Pelletier.

The Canadian Figure Skating Association invited the pair to compete at Skate Canada, where they placed second in the short program – ahead of reigning Canadian Champions Kristy Sargeant and Kris Wirtz – and third in the long program to win the bronze medal. Because of their success, they were invited to the NHK Trophy in Japan and won another bronze medal.

Their fall successes made them favorites for the Canadian title, but they struggled technically and finished second. The silver medal earned them a spot on the Four Continents and World team, but Pelletier&#x27;s back pain forced the pair to withdraw from both competitions. They spent two months off the ice recuperating.

=== 1999–2000 ===
In the summer of 1999, Gaulthier enlisted the help of Lori Nichol, a successful Canadian choreographer who was known for her work with Michelle Kwan. She created a playful tango piece for their short program, and, after a suggestion from coach Marijane Stong, set their long program to music from the movie Love Story.

They won several competitions with this program. At the 1999 Skate America competition, they defeated the reigning and two-time world champions and Olympic silver medalists Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze by winning both the short and long programs. At their second Grand Prix event, Nations Cup, they finished second to Russians Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov. With these solid results they went into the Grand Prix Final with high hopes and even higher expectations. However, several errors in both programs landed them in fifth place.

They competed at the 2000 Canadian Figure Skating Championships in Salé&#x27;s hometown of Calgary. They skated a strong short program but exceeded even their own expectations by skating a nearly flawless long program, earning five 6.0 marks in presentation – the first for a pair at the championships. They also captured another 6.0 and the gold medal at the Four Continents Championships in Osaka, Japan.

Expectations mounted before the 2000 World Championships in Nice, France. There, Salé had a major error on a spin in the short program, and they were placed third. During the long program, she again struggled, this time with her jumps, and they placed fourth overall.

=== 2000–2001 season ===
Salé and Pelletier returned to Lori Nichol for their 2000–01 programs. She choreographed a jazzy short to &quot;Come Rain or Come Shine&quot; and a dramatic, mature long to Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Tristan und Isolde.&quot; They returned to Skate America and Skate Canada that fall, winning both over Shen/Zhao and Berezhnaia/Sikharulidze, respectively. Berezhnaia/Sikharulidze then defeated them at Trophée Lalique.

The pair was again successful at the 2001 Canadian Championships in Winnipeg, but did not earn the string of 6.0s that &quot;Love Story&quot; had brought them the previous year. They went on to win again at Four Continents in Salt Lake City, the site for the 2002 Olympics, and revived &quot;Love Story&quot; to win the Grand Prix Final – despite Salé missing the side by side triple toe loop in all three phases of the competition.

The 2001 World Championships were held in Vancouver, and Salé and Pelletier entered as heavy favorites. Trouble on the side by side jumps landed them in third place in the short program, but the team was placed first in the long program despite Salé singling a side-by-side double axel. They were the first Canadian pair to win Worlds since Isabelle Brasseur and Lloyd Eisler in 1993, and the first pair to win at a Worlds held in Canada since Barbara Underhill and Paul Martini in 1984. They would later win the Lou Marsh Trophy as outstanding Canadian athlete in 2001.

=== 2002 Winter Olympics ===
Salé and Pelletier again had early success in the 2001–02 season, winning both Skate America and Skate Canada with their new long program to &quot;Adagio Sostenuto&quot; by Rachmaninoff, nicknamed &quot;Orchid&quot; for its flower theme.

The Grand Prix Final, held in Kitchener, Ontario, was important because it was the only chance to test their programs against the top contenders before the Olympics. Despite a rough performance of &quot;Orchid&quot; in the first long program, Salé and Pelletier once again won the event, skating a clean performance of &quot;Love Story&quot; for their second long program. They headed into the 2002 Canadian Championships in Hamilton, Ontario with confidence, having defeated Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze, their biggest rivals. They were able to win the title despite missing several elements in the long program, and the performance increased talks that they would revert to &quot;Love Story&quot; for the Olympic Games.

The pressure for the Olympics was intense. Despite several silvers and bronzes, Canada had only won two gold medals in figure skating, in 1948 and 1960. All eyes were on Salé and Pelletier to break the streak and win, overcoming the Russian pairs dominance that had lasted for 40 years. They skated their short program well, only to trip and fall on their closing pose. Because the fall was not on an element, it did not receive a deduction. They placed second behind Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze. In the long program, Salé and Pelletier had no obvious mistakes. Berezhnaya and Sikharludize, meanwhile, skated a more difficult program in which Sikharulidze had a minor step out on a jump element before quickly regaining unison with his partner. The minor error from the Russians had many convinced that the Canadians had won the gold but when the judges&#x27; scores came up, Salé and Pelletier were placed second in the long program. Four judges placed Salé and Pelletier first, while five had Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze as the winners, with the Canadians receiving higher technical scores and the Russians higher presentation scores. This result spurred an outcry from the North American media who emphasized Sikharulidze&#x27;s stepout, although there was no media criticism a year earlier when Salé and Pelletier were awarded gold at the 2001 World Championships, while ignoring that Salé and Pelletier had fallen in the short program and not received a deduction. The commentators received criticism for failing to mention Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze&#x27;s strengths, with some observers stating that the Russians had performed a more challenging program with greater speed, more interweaving moves and transitions, and less distance between the partners. The next day, the French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne admitted she had been pressured into awarding the long program to the Russians in exchange for a first-place vote for the French ice dancing team of Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat, and a judging controversy quickly blew up. The scandal ultimately resulted in the suspension of several judges and officials, and Le Gougne&#x27;s vote was discarded, leaving the long program a tie. Salé and Pelletier were awarded gold medals in a special ceremony later in the week.

The controversy resulted in several changes to the judging system. First, anonymous judging was incorporated to &quot;relieve outside pressure&quot; from judges by separating their names from their marks so pressurers could not know whether the judge had acted as they wished. After two years of this system, the Code of Points was implemented and began use in the Grand Prix season of 2003–04, and full usage for all 2004–05 competitions and thereafter.

=== Since Salt Lake City ===
After the Olympics, Salé and Pelletier turned professional and began touring North America with &quot;Stars on Ice&quot;, a figure skating show.

In 2006, Salé and Pelletier served as commentators on &quot;Olympic Ice&quot;, which aired on USA Network during the 2006 Winter Olympics.

Salé and Pelletier were inducted into the Skate Canada Hall of Fame in 2008. They were inducted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame on March 26, 2009.

In October 2009, Salé began competing on the first season of the CBC&#x27;s &quot;Battle of the Blades&quot;. She was partnered with Craig Simpson, lead analyst for &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; and a former professional hockey player. The two had known each other for years through Edmonton’s skating scene. They won the competition in November 2009.

In 2010, Salé competed on the second season of &quot;Battle of the Blades&quot;, this time paired with Theoren Fleury. She returned in 2013 as a judge on the show&#x27;s fourth season.

== Personal life ==
Salé and Pelletier became engaged on Christmas Day 2004 at their Edmonton, Alberta home, and married on December 30, 2005 at the Fairmont Banff Springs hotel in Banff, Alberta. Their son was born on September 30, 2007.

On June 4, 2010, it was reported that Salé and Pelletier had decided to divorce, but planned to remain skating partners; they skated together until they retired in 2012. In later interviews, Salé stated that they had separated in March 2009, but chose to keep the news private for over a year.

On June 21, 2012 in California, Salé married her season 1 &quot;Battle of the Blades&quot; partner Craig Simpson, who split from his first wife in March 2010. Salé and Simpson have one daughter, born on July 7, 2013. Through this marriage, Salé is also a stepmother to Simpson&#x27;s three children from his first marriage.

In a November 2019 guest column in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, Salé wrote that the end of her marriage with Pelletier and her professional skating career had left her with &quot;feelings of emptiness and discontentment&quot; and she &quot;fell into deep despair.&quot; She said that support from friends and family helped her get through her feelings of despair, and an encounter with a life coach inspired her to become a motivational speaker and life coach.

By July 2021, Salé and Simpson were no longer living together, and Salé filed for divorce in 2022. She said that they separated due to her belief in conspiracy theories.

=== Political views and conspiracy theories ===
Salé and Theo Fleury host &quot;The Theo &amp; Jamie Show: Fire and Ice&quot;, an online program with the Calgary-based conservative media outlet Canadians for Truth. She has compared Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler, promoted conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccines, called the use of face masks on children a form of &quot;child abuse&quot; and referred to vaccine mandates as &quot;medical rape&quot;.

Columnist Gary Mason of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote in a November 2022 column: &quot;[Salé] has emerged as an ardent anti-vaxxer who has said putting a mask on a child is &#x27;child abuse.&#x27; Her Twitter feed is an endless flow of dubious claims from dubious sources. She happily goes down rabbit holes to share falsehoods about the World Economic Forum and the &#x27;Great Reset,&#x27; which conspiracists claim is an effort by the global elite to dismantle capitalism and impose radical change on the world.&quot;

In May 2022, she shared an image of a fabricated news article that claimed the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine only had a 12% efficacy rate. The image was designed to look like it was from Global News, although Reuters confirmed with the outlet that there was no such story.

In August 2022, she posted another image of a fabricated news article that claimed Trudeau said climate change was to blame for anger and resentment toward politicians. This time the image was designed to look like it came from CBC News. Agence France-Presse confirmed with CBC News that the article did not exist.

<text>Iridescence (also known as goniochromism) is the phenomenon of certain surfaces that appear gradually to change colour as the angle of view or the angle of illumination changes. Iridescence is caused by wave interference of light in microstructures or thin films. Examples of iridescence include soap bubbles, feathers, butterfly wings and seashell nacre, and minerals such as opal. [[Iridescence#Pearlescence|Pearlescence]] is a related effect where some or most of the reflected light is white. The term pearlescent is used to describe certain paint finishes, usually in the automotive industry, which actually produce iridescent effects.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;iridescence&quot; is derived in part from the Greek word ἶρις &quot;îris&quot; (gen. ἴριδος &quot;íridos&quot;), meaning &quot;rainbow&quot;, and is combined with the Latin suffix &quot;-escent&quot;, meaning &quot;having a tendency toward&quot;. Iris in turn derives from the goddess Iris of Greek mythology, who is the personification of the rainbow and acted as a messenger of the gods. &quot;Goniochromism&quot; is derived from the Greek words &quot;gonia&quot;, meaning &quot;angle&quot;, and &quot;chroma&quot;, meaning &quot;colour&quot;.

== Mechanisms ==

Iridescence is an optical phenomenon of surfaces in which hue changes with the angle of observation and the angle of illumination. It is often caused by multiple reflections from two or more semi-transparent surfaces in which phase shift and interference of the reflections modulates the incidental light, by amplifying or attenuating some frequencies more than others. The thickness of the layers of the material determines the interference pattern. Iridescence can for example be due to thin-film interference, the functional analogue of selective wavelength attenuation as seen with the Fabry–Pérot interferometer, and can be seen in oil films on water and soap bubbles. Iridescence is also found in plants, animals and many other items. The range of colours of natural iridescent objects can be narrow, for example shifting between two or three colours as the viewing angle changes,
Iridescence can also be created by diffraction. This is found in items like CDs, DVDs, some types of prisms, or cloud iridescence. In the case of diffraction, the entire rainbow of colours will typically be observed as the viewing angle changes. In biology, this type of iridescence results from the formation of diffraction gratings on the surface, such as the long rows of cells in striated muscle, or the specialized abdominal scales of peacock spider &quot;Maratus robinsoni&quot; and &quot;M. chrysomelas&quot;. Some types of flower petals can also generate a diffraction grating, but the iridescence is not visible to humans and flower-visiting insects as the diffraction signal is masked by the colouration due to plant pigments.

In biological (and biomimetic) uses, colours produced other than with pigments or dyes are called structural colouration. Microstructures, often multi-layered, are used to produce bright but sometimes non-iridescent colours: quite elaborate arrangements are needed to avoid reflecting different colours in different directions. Structural colouration has been understood in general terms since Robert Hooke&#x27;s 1665 book &quot;Micrographia&quot;, where Hooke correctly noted that since the iridescence of a peacock&#x27;s feather was lost when it was plunged into water, but reappeared when it was returned to the air, pigments could not be responsible. It was later found that iridescence in the peacock is due to a complex photonic crystal.

== Pearlescence ==

Pearlescence is an effect related to iridescence and has a similar cause. Structures within a surface cause light to be reflected back, but in the case of pearlescence some or most of the light is white, giving the object a pearl-like luster. Artificial pigments and paints showing an iridescent effect are often described as pearlescent, for example when used for car paints.

== Examples ==

=== Life ===

==== Invertebrates ====
&quot;Eledone moschata&quot; has a bluish iridescence running along its body and tentacles.

==== Vertebrates ====
The feathers of birds such as kingfishers, birds-of-paradise, hummingbirds, parrots, starlings, grackles, ducks, and peacocks are iridescent. The lateral line on the neon tetra is also iridescent. A single iridescent species of gecko, &quot;Cnemaspis kolhapurensis&quot;, was identified in India in 2009. The tapetum lucidum, present in the eyes of many vertebrates, is also iridescent. Iridescence is known to be present among prehistoric non-avian and avian dinosaurs such as dromaeosaurids, enantiornithes, and lithornithids. Muscle tissues can display irisdescence. 

==== Plants ====
Many groups of plants have developed iridescence as an adaptation to use more light in dark environments such as the lower levels of tropical forests. The leaves of Southeast Asia&#x27;s &quot;Begonia pavonina&quot;, or peacock begonia, appear iridescent azure to human observers due to each leaf&#x27;s thinly layered photosynthetic structures called iridoplasts that absorb and bend light much like a film of oil over water. Iridescences based on multiple layers of cells are also found in the lycophyte &quot;Selaginella&quot; and several species of ferns.

=== Non-biological ===

==== Minerals ====
==== Meteorological ====
==== Human-made ====
Nanocellulose is sometimes iridescent, as are thin films of petrol and some other hydrocarbons and alcohols when floating on water.

<text>Edward Clark Potter (November 26, 1857 – June 21, 1923) was an American sculptor best known for his equestrian and animal statues. His most famous works are the marble lions, nicknamed &quot;Patience&quot; and &quot;Fortitude&quot;, in front of the New York Public Library Main Branch

==Early years==
Born in New London, Connecticut, he grew up in Enfield, Massachusetts, where he lived with his mother Mary and sister Clara. There he went to local schools. At 17, due to his mother&#x27;s wish that he become a minister, he entered Williston Seminary in Easthampton, Massachusetts, for four years. He entered Amherst College in Amherst, Massachusetts, in the class of 1882. He only attended for three semesters, but later was granted an honorary Master&#x27;s degree. He studied drawing at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston with Frederic Crowninshield and Otto Grundmann. There he also did some modelling with the sculptor Truman H. Bartlett.

==Career==
In 1883 he became an assistant to Daniel Chester French and concentrated on animal studies and working as a manager and salesman in the quarries.
From 1887 to 1889 he studied sculpture at the Académie Julian in Paris with Antonin Mercié and Emmanuel Frémiet, becoming an accomplished &quot;animalier&quot; (animal sculptor). During his years there, he exhibited several pieces at the Salon: small groups of rabbits, a bust of a black man, a sketch from an American Indian group, and a sleeping faun with a rabbit.

For the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago he collaborated with his teacher and friend Daniel Chester French on several of the important sculptures of the exposition. Unfortunately these statues, like most of the architecture of the fair, were made of &quot;staff&quot;, a temporary material of plaster, cement, and jute fibers, first used in buildings of the Paris exhibition in 1878.

He was elected to the National Sculpture Society in 1893, and joined the Society of American Artists in 1894. This later merged with the National Academy to which he was elected in 1906. Potter won a gold medal at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis in 1904.
His most famous work is the pair of pink Tennessee marble lions in front of the New York Public Library Main Branch, carved by the Piccirilli brothers. Potter was recommended for this commission by Augustus Saint-Gaudens. The lions were originally nicknamed &quot;Leo Astor&quot; and &quot;Leo Lenox&quot;, for the two private libraries that formed the collection&#x27;s core, but mayor Fiorello La Guardia renamed them for qualities New Yorkers were showing in weathering the Great Depression—&quot;Patience&quot; (on the left or south) and &quot;Fortitude&quot; (on the right or north)—and those names have stuck.

A resident of Greenwich, Connecticut, after 1902, he sculpted the memorial to Raynal Bolling there in 1922. The Cos Cob section of Greenwich is considered one of the birthplaces of American Impressionism. Potter was a founder and first president of the Greenwich Society of Artists, founded in 1912.

He died at his summer home in New London, Connecticut.

<text>Emmanuel Frémiet (6 December 182410 September 1910) was a French sculptor. He is famous for his 1874 sculpture of Joan of Arc in Paris (and its &quot;sister&quot; statues in Philadelphia and Portland, Oregon) and the monument to Ferdinand de Lesseps in Suez. The noted sculptor Pierre-Nicolas Tourgueneff was one of many students who learned sculpture under the tutelage of Frémiet.

==Early life==
Born in Paris, he was a nephew and pupil of Sophie Frémiet, and later he became a pupil of her husband François Rude. He chiefly devoted himself to animal sculpture. His earliest work was in scientific lithography (osteology), and for a while he served in times of adversity in the gruesome office of painter to the morgue. In 1843 he sent to the Salon a study of a Gazelle, and after that date worked prolifically. His &quot;Wounded Bear&quot; and &quot;Wounded Dog&quot; were produced in 1850, and the Luxembourg Museum at once secured this striking example of his work.

==Career==

In the 1850s, Frémiet produced various Napoleonic works. He first exhibited in the Paris Salon at the age of nineteen with a sculpture of an Algerian gazelle. In 1853, Frémiet, &quot;the leading sculptor of animals in his day&quot; exhibited bronze sculptures of Emperor Napoleon III&#x27;s basset hounds at the Paris Salon. Soon afterwards, from 1855 to 1859 Frémiet was engaged on a series of military statuettes for Napoleon III, none of which have survived.

He produced his equestrian statue of Napoleon I in 1868, and of Louis d&#x27;Orleans of 1869 (at the Château de Pierrefonds) and in 1874 the first equestrian statue of Joan of Arc, erected in the Place des Pyramides, Paris; this he afterwards (1889) replaced with another version. During this period he also executed &quot;Pan and the Bear Cubs&quot;, also acquired by the Luxembourg Museum and in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay.

In 1887 he exhibited his &quot;Gorilla Carrying off a Woman&quot; which won him a medal of honour at the Salon. It depicts a large primate with a spear wound in his shoulder, carrying a still-alive female victim and a stone weapon. This sculpture divided critics at the time but is now recognised as one of his most significant works.

Of the same character is his &quot;Ourang-Outangs&quot; and &quot;Borneo Savage&quot; of 1895, a commission from the Paris Museum of Natural History. Frémiet also executed the statue of St Michael for the summit of the spire of the Eglise St Michel, and the equestrian statue of Velasquez for the Jardin de l&#x27;Infante at the Louvre. Named an Officer of the French Legion of Honor in 1878, he became a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1892, and succeeded Antoine-Louis Barye as professor of animal drawing at the Natural History Museum of Paris.

Frémiet died on 10 September 1910 in Paris and was buried in the Cimetière de Louveciennes.

<doc id="371803" wikidata="Q1075799" url="?curid=371803" title="Music of Albania">
<text>The music of Albania () is associated with the country of Albania and Albanian communities. Music has a long tradition in the country and is known for its regional diversity, from the Ghegs in the North to the Tosks in the South. It is an integral part of the national identity, strongly influenced by the country&#x27;s long and turbulent history, which forced Albanians to protect their culture from their overlords by living in rural and remote mountains.

Albanian popular music often incorporates the country&#x27;s folk music. Albanian folk music includes monophonic and polyphonic styles, responses, choral, instrumental and vocal music. Each region has a unique musical tradition that reflects its history, language and culture. Polyphonic singing and song forms are primarily found in South Albania, while in the North they are predominantly monophonic. Albanian iso-polyphony has been declared an UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The Gjirokastër National Folklore Festival, held every five years in Gjirokastër, is an important venue exhibiting traditional Albanian music.

Albanian music extends to ancient Illyria and Ancient Greece, with influences from the Byzantine and Ottoman Empire. It is evident in archeological findings such as arenas, odeons, theatre buildings and amphitheatres, all over Albania. The remains of temples, libraries, sculptures and paintings of ancient dancers, singers and musical instruments, have been found in territories inhabited by the ancient Illyrians and ancient Greeks.

Church singing was performed throughout the early Middle Ages in Albania by choirs or soloists in ecclesiastical centers such as Berat, Durrës and Shkodër. The Middle Ages in Albania included choral music and traditional music. Shën Jan Kukuzeli, a singer, composer and musical innovator of Albanian origin, is one of the earliest known musicians.

Internationally renowned contemporary musicians of Albanian origin from Albania and Albanian diaspora include Action Bronson, Elvana Gjata, Ava Max, Bebe Rexha, Dua Lipa, Era Istrefi, Albert Stanaj, Dafina Zeqiri, Gashi, Ermal Meta, Enca, Elhaida Dani, Noizy, Unikkatil, and Rita Ora. In the field of classical music, several Albanian sopranos and tenors have gained international recognition including Rame Lahaj, Inva Mula, Marie Kraja, Saimir Pirgu and Ermonela Jaho, and the composer Vasil Tole, a member of the Academy of Sciences of Albania. Best voices of Albanian folk music include Vaçe Zela and Nexhmije Pagarusha. Among the most influential and best performers of the Albanian &quot;kaba&quot; – a folk instrumental expression of the Albanian Iso-Polyphony – are clarinetists Laver Bariu and Remzi Lela, and violinist Ethem Qerimaj.

== Folk music ==

Albanian folk music has a deep history and can be separated into three major stylistic groups: the northern Ghegs, southern Labs and Tosks and with other important urban music areas around Shkodër and Tirana. It reflects the cultural and political history of the Albanian people and geographic position in Southern Europe and the Mediterranean Sea.

The northern and southern traditions are contrasted by the rugged and heroic tone of the north and the relaxed, gentle and exceptionally beautiful form of the south. These disparate styles are unified by the intensity that both performers and listeners bring to their music as a medium for patriotic expression and as a vehicle carrying the narrative of oral history, as well as certain characteristics like the use of metres such as 3/8, 5/8 and 10/8.

Albanian folk songs can be divided into major groups, the heroic epics of the north and the sweetly melodic lullabies, love songs, wedding music, work songs and other kinds of song. The music of various festivals and holidays is also an important part of Albanian folk song, especially those that celebrate Lazarus Day, which inaugurates the springtime. Lullabies and laments are very important kinds of Albanian folk song, and are generally performed by solo women.

=== Northern Albania ===

The Ghegs from North of the Shkumbini River are known for a distinctive variety of sung epic poetry. The music of the north is particularly monophonic. Many of these are about the struggles of the Albanian people and history, the constant Albanian themes of honor, hospitality, treachery and revenge but also Skanderbeg, a legendary 15th century warrior who led the struggle against the Ottomans. These traditions are a form of oral history for the Ghegs and also preserve and inculcate moral codes and social values, necessary in a society that, until the early 20th century, relied on blood feuds as its primary means of law enforcement.

The most traditional variety of epic poetry is the Albanian Songs of the Frontier Warriors. These epic poems are sung, accompanied by a lahuta. It is rarely performed in modern Albania, but is found in the northern highlands within the Dukagjin highlands and Malësia. Other styles of epics also include the Këngë trimash or kreshnikësh (), ballads and maje krahis (). Major epics include &quot;Mujo and Halil&quot; and &quot;Halil and Hajrije&quot;.

Somewhat further south, around Dibër and Kërçovë in Macedonia, the lahuta is not used, replaced by the çifteli, a two-stringed instrument in which one string is used for the drone and one for the melody. Though men are the traditional performers (exception made for the sworn virgins), women have increasingly been taking part in epic balladry.

Along with the def, çifteli and sharki are used in a style of dance and pastoral songs. Homemade wind instruments are traditionally used by shepherds in northern Albania; these include the zumarë, an unusual kind of clarinet. This shepherds&#x27; music is &quot;melancholic and contemplative&quot; in tone. The songs called &quot;maje-krahi&quot; are another important part of North Albanian folk song; these were originally used by mountaineers to communicate over wide distances, but are now seen as songs. &quot;Maje-krahi&quot; songs require the full range of the voice and are full of &quot;melismatic nuances and falsetto cries&quot;.
=== Southern Albania === 


Southern Albanian music is soft and gentle, and polyphonic in nature with similarities to Greek music on polyphonic song of Epirus. Vlorë in the southwest has perhaps the most unusual vocal traditions in the area, with four distinct parts (&quot;taker&quot;, &quot;thrower&quot;, &quot;turner&quot; and &quot;drone&quot;) that combine to create a complex and emotionally cathartic melody. Author Kim Burton has described the melodies as &quot;decorated with falsetto and vibrato, sometimes interrupted by wild and mournful cries&quot;. This polyphonic vocal music is full of power that &quot;stems from the tension between the immense emotional weight it carries, rooted in centuries of pride, poverty and oppression, and the strictly formal, almost ritualistic nature of its structure&quot;.

South Albania is also known for funeral laments with a chorus and one to two soloists with overlapping, mournful voices. There is a prominent folk love song tradition in the south, in which performers use free rhythm and consonant harmonies, elaborated with ornamentation and melisma.

The Tosk people are known for ensembles consisting of violins, clarinets, lahutë (a kind of lute) and def. Eli Fara, a popular émigré performer, is from Korçë, but the city of Përmet is the centre for southern musical innovation, producing artists like Remzi Lela and Laver Bariu. Lela is of special note, having founded a musical dynasty that continues with his descendants playing a part in most of the major music institutions in Tirana.

Southern instrumental music includes the sedate kaba, an ensemble-driven by a clarinet or violin alongside accordions and llautës. The Albanian &quot;kaba&quot; is an improvised and melancholic style with melodies that Kim Burton describes as &quot;both fresh and ancient&quot;, &quot;ornamented with swoops, glides and growls of an almost vocal quality&quot;, exemplifying the &quot;combination of passion with restraint that is the hallmark of Albanian culture.&quot; Among the most influential and best performers of the Albanian &quot;kaba&quot; are clarinetists Laver Bariu and Remzi Lela, and violinist Ethem Qerimaj.

The ethnic Greek inhabitants of the country&#x27;s southern parts, have a music very similar to the music of Epirus in Greece.

=== Instrumentation ===

Instrumentation are an integral part of Albanian folk music, especially in the north. Those instruments can be divided into string, wind and percussion categories. They vary from region to region and are used frequently throughout the entire country, performing both dance and instrumental polyphonic folk music.

The lahuta, a single-stringed instrument, is rooted in Albanian epic poetry with emphasis on important historical and patriotic events from history. It is usually played only by men during winter evenings by the fireplace. The instrument is primarily widespread in the mountainous northern area of the country but can be also found in the center of the country. It is often made from a single wood block composed of various types of woods including maple, spruce and oak. The head of the lahuta is decorated with symbols of ancient cults such as the head of the capricorn, which is the symbol of the Helmet of Skanderbeg.

Çiftelia is a long necked stringed instrument and frequently used by Gheg Albanians in northeastern Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro and North Macedonia. It is an integral part of northern traditional instrumental ensembles, commonly played in the context of northern wedding music.

Fyell, also known as Zumare, is a similar instrument to a pennywhistle and is mostly played by shepherds in the north along with a shepherd&#x27;s flute. The instrument contains five holes in each pipe and a bell. The melodies which are played with a fyell are homophonic and sounds nasal as well as very strong and powerful.

Violina is usually used since the 19th century in both the northern and southern region. In the past, it was held in a vertical position like a violoncello or a lahuta but is not practised anymore.

=== Emergence ===

The development of groups of instrumentalists played a significant role for the establishment of urban music in Albania. In the cities of northern Albania these instrumentalist groups were referred to as &quot;ahengje&quot; (meaning roughly &#x27;to party&#x27; or &#x27;partying&#x27;) in Shkodër and as &quot;orkestrina&quot; (&#x27;little orchestras&#x27;) in Tirana, Durrës, Kavajë and Elbasan; while in all cities of southern Albania they were referred to as &quot;saze&quot; (another term for &#x27;little orchestras&#x27;). Conglomerates of solists or groups of instrumentalists were referred to as &quot;taifa&quot;, which were created in order to facilitate the professional rights and existence of the musicians.

With the growth of the cities their music began to develop peculiar features that were inclined to be accepted by the bulk of Albanians. The &quot;popullore&quot; (&#x27;popular&#x27;) songs covered repertories which incorporated urban songs, as well as Romani songs, and sometimes also complex folk music. It has been suggested that before the second half of the 20th century &quot;the entire musical life of Albania was determined by folk music&quot;. However, while the musical life of Albania may have been strongly influenced by folk music during the first half of the 20th century, urban lyric songs show that by 1930 that influence was no longer strong enough to thoroughly predominate the Albanian musical environment.

===1930s Urban Song===

The Albanian Urban Lyric Song is a tradition that started in Albania in the 18th century but culminated in the 1930s. These songs are a major part of Albania&#x27;s music heritage, but have been little-studied by ethnomusicologists, who prefer to focus on the rural folk music that they see as being more authentically Albanian.
Out of this melting pot of local and imported styles came a kind of lyrical art song based in the cities of Shkodra, Elbasan, Berat and Korça. Though similar traditions existed in other places, they were little recorded and remain largely unknown. 
By the end of the 19th century, Albanian nationalism was inspiring many to attempt to remove the elements of Turkish music from Albanian culture, a desire that was intensified following independence in 1912; bands that formed during this era like the Korçë-based Lira Chorus played a variety of European styles, including marches and waltzes. Urban song in the early 20th century could be divided into two styles: the historic or nationalistic style, and the lyrical style. The lyrical style included a wide array of lullabies and other forms, as well as love songs.

In the early decade of the 1930s, urban art song had been incorporated into classical music, while the singer Marie Kraja made a popular career out of art songs; she was one of Albania&#x27;s first popular singers. The first recordings, however, of urban art song came as early as 1937, with the orchestral sounds of Tefta Tashko-Koço.

=== Communist period ===
Modern Albanian popular music uses instruments like the çifteli and sharki, which have been used in large bands since the Second World War to great popular acclaim; the same songs, accompanied by clarinet and accordion, are performed at small weddings and celebrations.

A massive rise of popular music – &quot;muzika e lehtë&quot; – occurred during the communist period in Albania, with renowned singers like Vaçe Zela and Parashqevi Simaku. 

The censorship imposed by Enver Hoxha in almost all musical genres banned in particular Western contemporary music from all stages of Albania, and its broadcasting was forbidden. The national song contest Festivali i Këngës has been organized since 1961, and it provided an authorized platform for nonconformist musical forms similar to the Western models.

The 1972 edition was a turning point for the contest, in which dictator Enver Hoxha prosecuted the organisers of Festivali i Këngës 11 after declaring them &quot;enemies of the public&quot;. They were accused of endangering the country with &quot;immoral aspects&quot; in their songs and performances. Following this development, the ruling Communist Party imposed numerous sanctions on the festival&#x27;s content, with a strict censorship on anything deemed inappropriate by the government. This ranged from limiting the type of clothes artists could wear, to restricting their range of movement while performing. The main organisers of the show were accused of conspiring against the country and corrupting its youth.

=== 90s and beyond ===
The isolationism of contemporary music ceased after the fall of the regime, and the popular music of Albania was rapidly integrated into the overall trends in Southeast Europe, with the promotion of hybrid musical forms using synthetic accompaniments. Tallava is a pop music genre originating in Kosovo, also popular in Albania and North Macedonia, in the Albanian-speaking communities. Having originated in the Roma community in Kosovo in the 1990s, it is oriental-sounding, and perceived of as low-status. Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly popular in Albania and North Macedonia. It is identified as part of the wider Pop-folk genre of the Southeastern Europe, which includes Chalga from Bulgaria, Skiladiko from Greece, Manele from Romania and Turbo-folk from Serbia.

Albania has participated in the Eurovision Song Contest since 2004.

===Albanian music in North Macedonia and Kosovo===
Kosovo has been home to many important Albanian musicians, and the same can be said for North Macedonia. Prior to the Kosovo War, there was a thriving music industry in Kosovo, which reached new heights in recent years. The Kosovar music industry was home to many famous musicians, including the famous Nexhmije Pagarusha, Ismet Peja and the romantic, more elaborate Qamili i Vogël of Gjakova. The Macedonian band Vëllezërit Aliu became well- known for the traditional vocal duets accompanied by drum box, electric bass, synthesizer and clarinet or saxophone. &quot;Gjurmët&quot; is one of the most famous and influential 1980s rock bands from Pristina.

=== Rock ===
Rock arrived in Albania, particularly in Kosovo, in 1950 with an American and British influence. The first distinctively Albanian rock band was Blue Star, founded in Pristina. 
== Classical music ==

=== Opera ===

Palokë Kurti is usually said to be among the founders of Albanian opera. A native of Shkodër, he was a musical amateur who composed the Unity of Albania March (Bashkimi Shqipnis) in 1881. Another composer and also a priest, Martin Gjoka is also considered to be one of the most important founders of Albanian classical music. Gjoka is said to be the first Albanian musician who showed great interest in traditional Albanian folk music considerably that of the deep mountainous areas of the north of Albania that was less influenced by foreign music. During his lifetime, he composed several vocal and instrumental music using elements of urban art song and the folk melodies of the north.

In the 19th and 20th century, Fan S. Noli and Mikel Koliqi contributed to the development of classical music culture in Albania. They achieved prominence, with Noli using urban folk songs in his &quot;Byzantine Overture&quot; and is also known for a symphonic poem called &quot;Scanderberg&quot;. Koliqi spent much of his life in prison for his religious beliefs, but managed to compose melodramas such as &quot;The Siege of Shkodër&quot;, &quot;The Red Scarf&quot; and &quot;Rozafa&quot;.

Other pivotal composers in modern Albanian classical music were Thoma Nassi, Kristo Kono, Frano Ndoja and Lec Kurti who composed &quot;Arbereshja&quot; in 1915.

Prenk Jakova became well known for operas including &quot;Scanderbeg&quot; and &quot;Mrika&quot;, which were influenced by traditional Italian opera, the belcanto style and Albanian folk music. Çesk Zadeja composed in many styles, from symphonies to ballets, beginning in 1956, and also helped found the Music Conservatory of Tirana, the Theatre of Opera and Ballet, and the Assembly of Songs and Dances.

Later in the middle of the 20th century, Albanian composers came to focus on ballets, opera and other styles; these included Tonin Harapi, Tish Daija, Nikolla Zoraqi, Thoma Gaqi, Feim Ibrahimi, Shpëtim Kushta and many others. Since the fall of the communism in Albania in the 21st century, composers like Aleksandër Peçi, ethnologist musician Ramadan Sokoli, Sokol Shup, Endri Sina, Pëllumb Vorpsi and Vasil Tole have arisen, as have new music institutions like the Society of Music Professionals and the Society of New Albanian Music.

The contemporary opera artists such as Inva Mula, Ermonela Jaho and Saimir Pirgu have achieved international recognition for their music.

==Contemporary music==

In Albania, the most prominent rock bands and individuals only appeared after 1990 as rock music was prohibited. However, youth groups found ways to listen it through clandestine channels.

Furthermore, electronic music has become a mainstream music genre in Albania. Albanian artists and renowned DJs such as DJ Aldo, Vin Veli, DJ Sardi, Dj Tedd and others are successfully collaborating mainly with Italian and Romanian artists, while showcasing themselves in renown clubs in Tirana and in annual music festivals along the Albanian Riviera such as Turtle Fest and Soundwave Albania.

<text>The Athens Wireless Metropolitan Network (AWMN) is a grassroots wireless community network established in 2002 in Athens, Greece. By August 2010, the network had grown to include 1,120 backbone nodes, with over 2,900 client computers actively linked to it. There is also an association-club that supports the network&#x27;s objectives.

== Cultural and geographical context ==
Although the network began in Athens, the capital of Greece, its activities are no longer limited to the city. It covers a geographical area 110 km from North to South and 85 km from West to East, with the most southern point being Palaia Epidavros (Epidaurus) and the most northern point being the town of Nea Artaki on the island of Euboea. The wide expansion of the network allows isolated areas with poor technological and broadband infrastructure to connect with the Athenian network. The islands of Aegina, Salamina and the regions surrounding Athens are also connected to the network.

Recently the island of Euboea connected with more links with AWMN for redundancy purposes and the next stage will be to join the wireless &#x27;islets&#x27; located in Corinth, Lamia (city) and Volos. There are also plans to reach even more remote cities of Greece such as Patras.

This year AWMN connected most of the Greek communities and managed to cross the Greek borders. It has initiated a VPN connection with &quot;wlan slovenija&quot; network in Slovenia with the vision to connect all the wireless communities of Europe into one network.

== Project history ==
AWMN was formed as a community back in 2002. Due to tremendous problems with broadband services in Greece in 2002 the number of such services available to home users was extremely limited. AWMN was founded as an alternative broadband network, which allowed its users to experience real broadband services.

However, an increasing number of people started to have an interest in the network. The number of network nodes started to grow exponentially, and the network&#x27;s character changed from an alternative telecom network to a social network of people based on their interest in the IT/Telecom sector.

The objectives of the project include the following: 
* Creating, developing and maintaining a Wireless Community Network which will provide broadband services to its members.
* Developing technologies based on wireless and digital telecommunications.
* Educate the public on the use of wireless and digital communications
* Promote and encourage volunteerism and active participation.

The association, as of August 2010, has around 67 members. Not all members of the backbone network are members of the association, and there are around 900 that do not want to participate in the association, due to the extent of moderation and speech censorship that is practiced in the association&#x27;s forum, wiki and assembly. Participation in the association has, throughout its history, always been on a voluntary basis. No one is obliged to sign a peering agreement as long as it is not needed, and no one has to join the association to participate to the network, rendering the AWMN network one of the most open networks in the world. However all 1080 backbone node owners are obliged to accept responsibility for the smooth running of their node, follow the basic rules of the community and follow basic network neutrality rules.

== The community ==
Users are categorised as backbone nodes and AP client nodes. The backbone nodes are nodes routing data that have no origin and destination themselves.

The network is a mosaic of people from varying ages and educational backgrounds including IT and telecommunications professionals, radio amateurs, IT students and technology enthusiasts. All are driven by a strong community spirit and contribute on a voluntary basis.

== Technology ==
AWMN makes extensive use of the IEEE 802.11 set of standards and operates on the 2.4 GHz (mainly for the Open APs) and 5.4 GHz (for the backbone links) license-free ISM frequency bands. Over the last few years, AWMN has tested (and later used in production environments) equipment from a huge variety of vendors.

The routing protocol used by the network is BGP. Efforts have been made to move towards new, more adaptive, experimental protocols such as OLSR and B.A.T.M.A.N. Some members of the AWMN community have contributed feedback and code to many Linux routing projects.

Homemade equipment is encouraged. Many workshops have been held so that members can become familiar with constructing their own aerials and cables. Additionally, the community regularly organizes seminars to educate aspiring network administrators on wireless technologies, protocols, routing and Linux, in the conditions of an operational large-scale network.

A wide variety of software is used in the network but AWMN services rely heavily on open-source software, Linux (or other free Unix variants).

== Services ==
The network currently provides a full-featured internal VoIP network, High Definition streaming services, game servers, file sharing services, hundreds of users/nodes webpages, network statistics services, routing, network monitoring, weather stations and VPN servers.

WiND is a web application for wireless community networks, such as AWMN itself, which has been created by members of AWMN. WiND provides a front-end interface to a database where information of the nodes can be stored, such as position details, DNS, IP addressing and a list of provided network services.

<text>Marius Jean Antonin Mercié (October 30, 1845 in Toulouse – December 12, 1916 in Paris), was a French sculptor, medallist and painter.

== Biography ==

Mercié entered the École des Beaux-Arts, Paris, and studied under Alexandre Falguière and François Jouffroy, and in 1868 gained the Grand Prix de Rome at the age of 23. His first great popular successes were the &quot;David&quot; and &quot;Gloria Victis&quot;. The latter bronze was shown and received the Medal of Honour of the Paris Salon and was subsequently placed in the Square Montholon.

The bronze &quot;David&quot; was one of his most popular works. The Biblical hero is depicted naked with the head of Goliath at his feet like Donatello&#x27;s David, but with a turbanned head and sheathing his long sword. Numerous reproductions exist, most of which incorporate a loincloth that covers David&#x27;s genitalia but not his buttocks. The lifesize original is in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay.

Mercié was appointed Professor of Drawing and Sculpture at the École des Beaux-Arts, and was elected a member of the Académie française in 1891, after being awarded the biennial prize of the Institute of 800 in 1887. He was subsequently elected to grand officier of the Légion d&#x27;honneur, and in 1913 became the president of the &quot;Société des artistes français&quot;. Marie-Antoinette Demagnez was among his many students at the École des Beaux-Arts. He died in Paris on December 12, 1916.

== Works ==

&quot;The Genius of the Arts&quot; (1877), a relief, is in the Tuileries, in substitution for Antoine-Louis Barye&#x27;s Napoleon III. A similar work for the tomb of Jules Michelet (1879; designed with architect Jean-Louis Pascal) is in Père Lachaise Cemetery, and in the same year Mercié produced the statue of &quot;Arago&quot; with accompanying reliefs, now erected at Perpignan.

In 1882 he repeated his great patriotic success of 1874 with a group &quot;Quand Même!&quot;, replicas of which have been set up at Belfort and in the garden of the Tuileries. &quot;Le Souvenir&quot; (1885), a marble statue for the tomb of Charles Ferry, was called one of his most beautiful works by the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. &quot;Regret&quot;, for the tomb of Alexandre Cabanel, was produced in 1892, along with &quot;William Tell&quot;, subsequently at Lausanne.

Mercié also designed the monuments to Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier (1895), erected in the Jardin de l&#x27;Infante in the Louvre, and Louis Faidherbe (1896) at Lille, a statue of Adolphe Thiers set up at St Germain-en-Laye, the monument to Paul Baudry at Père Lachaise, and that of Louis-Philippe and Queen Amélie for their tomb at Dreux. His stone group of &quot;Justice&quot; is at the Hôtel de Ville, Paris.

Numerous other statues, portrait busts, and medallions came from the sculptor&#x27;s hand, which gained him a medal of honor at the Paris Exhibition (1878) and the grand prix at that of 1889. Among the paintings exhibited by the artist are a Venus, to which was awarded a medal in 1883, &quot;Leda&quot; (1884), and &quot;Michelangelo studying Anatomy&quot; (1885), his most dramatic work in this medium.

Mercié is known in America primarily for three monuments: the 1890 Robert E. Lee equestrian bronze on Monument Avenue in Richmond, Virginia (the Robert E. Lee Monument), which was removed in September 2021; his 1891 collaboration with former teacher Alexandre Falguière on the statue of the Marquis de Lafayette in Lafayette Square, Washington, D.C.; and the 1911 Francis Scott Key Monument in Baltimore, Maryland.

<text>John R. Hicks (July 31, 1956 – November 29, 2005) was an American murderer executed by the U.S. state of Ohio. He was executed for the August 2, 1985, murder of his 5-year-old stepdaughter, Brandy Green. He was also convicted of the murder of his 56-year-old mother-in-law, Maxine Armstrong, for which he received a life sentence.

==Crime==
Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Hicks was a cocaine addict and alcoholic. He had purchased cocaine around 4 p.m. on August 2, 1985, but felt a further craving, so he took the VCR from his own home as security for a $50 purchase. He did not have the cash to redeem the VCR, so he knew his wife would become angry when she found out what he had done. He then decided to rob and murder Armstrong.

He telephoned Armstrong to say he was coming home. When he arrived around 11 p.m., he put his stepdaughter to bed. He then approached Armstrong from behind and strangled her with his own hands. To make sure she was dead, he used a length of clothesline. He searched her bedroom and stole $300 and some credit cards.

After buying more cocaine, he realized his stepdaughter would place him at the crime scene and could be a potential witness. He returned and smothered her with a pillow. When this failed to kill his stepdaughter, he tried to use his own hands and then duct taped her mouth and nose. He attempted to dismember Armstrong in the bathtub but gave up after nearly cutting one of her legs off. Returning to the body of Brandy Green, he removed her panties and penetrated her with his finger. His last plans in the apartment were to steal a checkbook, a ring, a .32 caliber pistol, and an ammunition box. After returning to his apartment around 3 a.m., he fled Cincinnati at 6 a.m. He was arrested two days later in Knoxville, Tennessee on August 4, 1985.

==Trial and appeals==
Hicks was convicted of the aggravated murder of Maxine Armstrong while committing robbery, for which he received a life sentence to be served concurrently with a 10 to 25-year sentence for aggravated robbery. In the murder of his 5-year-old stepdaughter, Hicks was convicted of aggravated murder to escape detention and the purposeful killing of more than two people. 

Hicks was sentenced to death on March 3, 1986, for the aggravated murder of Brandy Green.

Hicks&#x27;s lawyers have argued that under Ohio law, voluntary intoxication may be considered a mitigating factor in capital cases. They say that the jury was not instructed of this fact. In their report, the parole board wrote that although he was intoxicated, the &quot;merciless death&quot; of his stepdaughter was premeditated.

The jury was also told that the final decision of whether to impose a death sentence rested with the trial judge. They say that this may have led some jurors to vote for the death penalty, even though they had doubts about its appropriateness for the case. The Court of Appeals of Ohio overturned the later grounds for appeal. They stated that they did not endorse &quot;the perpetuation of a practice that has fallen into disfavor in this state.&quot;

Dr. Theodore Parran of the Case Western School of Medicine diagnosed Hicks with a psychotic decomposition and recommended that he be placed into a psychiatric facility for observation. Parran said that although Hicks&#x27; actions appeared deliberate, he did not know what he was doing.

The nine-member Ohio Parole Board recommended unanimously on November 15, 2005, that Governor Bob Taft deny clemency for Hicks. At the hearing, his brother pleaded for Hicks&#x27; life to be spared, while his sister-in-law argued that Hicks should be executed for his crimes.

==Execution==
John Hicks died by lethal injection at 10:20 a.m. on November 29, 2005, at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville, Ohio.

Asked for a final statement by the warden, he said:

It begun with a syringe in my arm and it ends with a needle in my arm. It&#x27;s come full circle. I realize that. … I know this may be shallow or hollow words to y&#x27;all but it&#x27;s coming from my heart.

After the drugs had begun to flow, he said, &quot;Whoa. Hallelujah&quot;, laughed loudly, and said, &quot;Yes. Thank you.&quot;

<doc id="371823" wikidata="Q373606" url="?curid=371823" title="Neil Goldschmidt">
<text>Neil Edward Goldschmidt (June 16, 1940 – June 12, 2024) was an American businessman and Democratic politician from the state of Oregon who held local, state, and federal offices over three decades. After serving as mayor of Portland, Oregon, the United States Secretary of Transportation under President Jimmy Carter and governor of Oregon, Goldschmidt was at one time considered the most powerful and influential figure in Oregon&#x27;s politics. In 2004, Goldschmidt&#x27;s career and legacy were irreparably damaged by revelations of the ongoing sexual abuse of a young teenage girl beginning in 1973, during his first term as mayor of Portland.

Goldschmidt was elected to the Portland City Council in 1970 and then as mayor of Portland in 1972, becoming, at the age of 32, the youngest mayor of any major American city. He promoted the revitalization of Downtown Portland and was influential on Portland-area transportation policy, particularly with the scrapping of the controversial Mount Hood Freeway and the establishment of the MAX Light Rail system. He was appointed U.S. Secretary of Transportation by President Jimmy Carter in 1979; in that capacity he worked to revive the ailing automobile industry and to deregulate several industries. He served until the end of Carter&#x27;s presidency in 1981 and then served as a senior executive with Nike for several years.

In 1986, Goldschmidt was elected the 33rd governor of Oregon, serving a single term. He faced significant challenges, particularly a rising anti-tax movement (leading to Measure 5 in 1990) and a doubling of the state&#x27;s prison population. He worked across party lines to reduce regulation and to repair the state&#x27;s infrastructure. His reforms to the State Accident Insurance Fund (SAIF), a state-chartered worker&#x27;s compensation insurance company were heralded at the time, but drew strong criticism in later years.

Despite an almost certain re-election as governor, Goldschmidt did not seek a second term, becoming an influential and controversial lobbyist. Over the next dozen years or so, he was criticized by editorial boards and Oregonians for several of the causes he supported, including backing the forestry corporation Weyerhaeuser in its hostile takeover of Oregon&#x27;s Willamette Industries and his advocacy for a private investment firm in its attempt to take over utility company Portland General Electric. In 2003, Governor Ted Kulongoski appointed Goldschmidt to the Oregon Board of Higher Education, a position he resigned after admitting he had sexually abused a minor girl 30 years earlier.

== Early life ==
Goldschmidt was born in Eugene, in Oregon&#x27;s Willamette Valley, on June 16, 1940, into a Jewish family to Lester H. Goldschmidt and Annette Levin. He graduated from South Eugene High School. He later attended the University of Oregon, also in Eugene. He served as student body president at the school before graduating in 1963 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science.

Goldschmidt earned a Juris Doctor from the University of California, Berkeley in 1967. From 1967 to 1970, he worked as a legal aid lawyer in Portland, Oregon. Goldschmidt served as an intern for U.S. Senator Maurine Neuberger in 1964 in Washington, D.C. While there, he was recruited by New York Congressman Allard K. Lowenstein to register voters in Mississippi&#x27;s 1964 Freedom Summer civil rights campaign.

== Political career ==
=== Portland City Commissioner and Mayor ===
Goldschmidt won a seat on the Portland City Council in 1970. As City Commissioner (1971–1973) and later as Mayor of Portland (1973–1979), Goldschmidt participated in the revitalization of the downtown section of that city. He led a freeway revolt against the unpopular Mount Hood Freeway, building consensus among labor unions and other powerful entities to divert Federal funds initially earmarked for the freeway to other projects, ultimately expanding the federal funds brought to the region to include the MAX Light Rail line and the Portland Transit Mall. He is widely credited with having opened up the city&#x27;s government to neighborhood activists and minorities, appointing women and African-Americans in a City Hall that had been dominated by an &quot;old-boy network&quot;. During his mayoral campaign, he questioned the benefit of expanding the city&#x27;s police force, preferring to direct resources to crime prevention. According to Nigel Jaquiss, a reporter for &quot;Willamette Week&quot;, for thirty years he was &quot;Oregon&#x27;s most successful and charismatic leader&quot;.

In 1973, Governor Tom McCall appointed Goldschmidt to what would be known as the Governor&#x27;s Task Force, which was tasked with exploring regional transportation solutions. Goldschmidt served alongside notable leaders: Glenn Jackson, chair of the board of Portland Power and Light and chair of the Oregon Transportation Commission, was considered the state&#x27;s leading power broker on transportation issues; and Gerard Drummond, a prominent lawyer and lobbyist, was president of Tri-Met&#x27;s board of directors. The task force considered an unpopular deal that would have funded the construction of the Mount Hood Freeway, which would have bisected southeast Portland. The deal, which would have been 90% funded by the Federal Highway Administration, was rescinded, with first the Multnomah County Commission and, later, Portland City Council reversing their positions and advising against it. Goldschmidt was initially opposed to diverting funds to light rail, instead favoring busways and more suitable local road projects; as the 1981 deadline to reallocate the funds approached, however, light rail became a more attractive prospect. By a process not clearly documented, light rail was included in the final plan. All federal money initially intended for the Mount Hood Freeway ultimately went to other road projects, but the total amount was doubled and the first leg of MAX light rail was approved and ultimately completed in 1986.

=== U.S. Secretary of Transportation ===

Goldschmidt became the sixth U.S. Secretary of Transportation in 1979. His recess appointment by President Jimmy Carter came on July 27 of that year, as part of a midterm restructuring of the Carter administration&#x27;s cabinet positions. The United States Senate confirmed his appointment on September 21, and he was sworn in on September 24. In this position, Goldschmidt was known for his work to revive the financially ailing U.S. auto industry, and efforts to deregulate the airline, trucking, and railroad industries.

A newcomer to the Carter administration and to national politics, Goldschmidt traded not only on his experience in transportation planning, but on his political acumen as well; following Carter&#x27;s unsuccessful bid for re-election in 1980, Goldschmidt expressed doubts about the future of the Democratic Party if it couldn&#x27;t learn to cultivate political allies more effectively. Goldschmidt&#x27;s time in Washington, DC, informed his own understanding of politics, as well. He remained in office through the remainder of the Carter administration. In late 1979, Republican presidential hopeful John B. Anderson called for Goldschmidt&#x27;s resignation, and members of the United States Senate Banking Committee later chastised him, for having suggested that he would withhold transportation funds from municipalities, such as Chicago and Philadelphia, whose mayors supported Ted Kennedy in his primary election bid against Carter. Goldschmidt resigned at the conclusion of Carter&#x27;s term on January 20, 1981.

Between positions in public office, Goldschmidt was a Nike executive during the 1980s, serving as international Vice President and then as president of Nike Canada. He was considered as a potential chair of the Democratic National Committee in 1984.

=== Governor of Oregon ===
In June 1985, Goldschmidt announced his candidacy for Governor of Oregon. His name familiarity and access to large donations through his business and political ties made him the Democratic front runner. He defeated Oregon State Senator Edward Fadeley in the May 1986 Democratic primary. Goldschmidt defeated Republican Secretary of State Norma Paulus in the 1986 general election 52% to 48%, succeeding two-term Republican Governor Victor Atiyeh, becoming the state&#x27;s 33rd governor.

Goldschmidt&#x27;s policy for economic development brought together Democratic liberals and Republican business leaders. His personal focus was on children&#x27;s rights, poverty, and crime, but the challenge of meeting increasing needs with a decreasing budget overshadowed his tenure. An anti-tax movement took hold during his term, passing the landmark Measure 5 in 1990, which restricted the generation of revenue by property tax. He was credited with leading &quot;The Oregon Comeback&quot;, bringing the state out of nearly eight years of recession, through regulatory reform and repair of the state&#x27;s infrastructure.

Goldschmidt oversaw a major expansion of the state&#x27;s prison system. In May 1987, he hired Michael Francke to modernize the state&#x27;s prisons, which an investigator had described as overcrowded and operated as &quot;independent fiefdoms&quot;. Francke was charged with supervising a plan to add over 1000 new beds to the prison system. Francke was murdered in the Department of Corrections parking lot in 1989.

In 1990, Goldschmidt brokered agreements between business, labor, and insurance interests that changed the state&#x27;s workers&#x27; compensation regulations. Workers&#x27; compensation has been a contentious issue in Oregon for some time, as the state-run State Accident Insurance Fund (SAIF) insures approximately 35% of the workforce. The legislature passed a law as a result. The changes were considered to benefit the insurance industry and business interests, at the expense of claimants, who were required to establish more extensively that their employers were responsible for injuries. The issue was contentious for some time, involving lawsuits and various efforts to modify the law. In 2000, Governor John Kitzhaber attempted to reform the system again. This led to a new law in the 2001 Legislature, which was complicated by an Oregon Supreme Court ruling that occurred during deliberations.

Goldschmidt&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Agenda was important in Oregon with its community initiatives. In 1991, he helped create the Oregon Children&#x27;s Foundation, as well as the Start Making A Reader Today (SMART) literacy program, which puts 10,000 volunteers into Oregon schools to read to children.

In 1990, Goldschmidt declined to run for a second term as governor, despite the fact that he would have almost certainly been easily re-elected; at the time, he cited marital difficulties. Bernie Giusto, who was Goldschmidt&#x27;s driver at the start of his term and later became Multnomah County Sheriff, was widely rumored to be romantically involved with Goldschmidt&#x27;s wife Margie (and later dated her openly after the Goldschmidts&#x27; divorce).

Goldschmidt had hoped at one time to serve two terms, noting that most of predecessor Tom McCall&#x27;s accomplishments came during his second term. In his farewell address to the City Club of Portland, he stated: &quot;After only four years, everything is left undone. Nothing is finished.&quot;

== After leaving elected office ==
Goldschmidt founded a law and consulting firm, Neil Goldschmidt, Inc., in Portland in 1991, four days after leaving office as governor. Even out of elected office, he was widely considered the most powerful political figure in the state for many years. His influence extended all over the state and the nation. As a member of the Oregon Health &amp; Science University board, Goldschmidt was an early advocate of the controversial Portland Aerial Tram, which connected the research hospital to real estate projects by his longtime associates Homer Williams and Irving Levin near land whose owners Goldschmidt later represented. He stayed active in Portland as well, advocating an expansion of the Park Blocks (a strip of open park space cutting through downtown Portland.) Goldschmidt assisted in the deal that led to the construction of TriMet&#x27;s MAX Red Line to Portland International Airport that opened in 2001. He also started the Start Making a Reader Today (SMART) volunteer program in Oregon schools.

Goldschmidt drew criticism in recent years for some of his business activities. In 2002, he lobbied business and political leaders to support Weyerhaeuser in its hostile takeover of Willamette Industries, Inc., then the only Fortune 500 company headquartered in Portland. In early 2004, he backed a purchase of Portland General Electric (PGE) by Texas Pacific Group which, though never consummated, put on hold city and county studies to acquire PGE by condemnation. Criticism of Goldschmidt&#x27;s business activities peaked when, on November 13, 2003, Governor Ted Kulongoski nominated him to the Oregon State Board of Higher Education.

Goldschmidt&#x27;s appointment was initially expected to meet with little opposition. Several state senators, however, voiced concerns about Goldschmidt&#x27;s involvement with SAIF and possible improprieties in the dealings he and his wife had with Texas Pacific. Senator Vicki Walker, in particular, emerged as an outspoken critic of Goldschmidt.

=== Revelation of sexual abuse ===
The increased scrutiny on Goldschmidt&#x27;s career, including reporters&#x27; difficulties accessing records from his term as governor, ultimately led to the revelation of his years-long sexual abuse of a minor girl, which had occurred decades before, during his tenure as Mayor of Portland. These revelations ended Goldschmidt&#x27;s extensive career at the center of Oregon politics and policymaking. In May 2004, a rapid series of events resulted in Goldschmidt&#x27;s confession to the continuing sexual abuse of a teenage girl in the mid-1970s; the quick demise of his political career, including resignations from several prominent organizations; and the transfer of his many documents from the privately run Oregon Historical Society to the state-run Oregon State Archives.

On May 6, under pressure from &quot;Willamette Week&quot;, Goldschmidt publicly announced that he had an inappropriate relationship with a 14-year-old girl (the victim later indicated she was 13) for an extended period during his first term as Mayor of Portland. Sex with a person under 16 years of age constitutes third degree rape under Oregon law, a felony punishable by up to five years in prison. By the time the abuse had become public, however, the statute of limitations of three years had expired, making Goldschmidt immune from any prosecution over the matter.

Goldschmidt&#x27;s confessional letter was published on the front page of &quot;The Oregonian&quot; on May 7, 2004. It differed from the &quot;Willamette Week&quot;&#x27;s account, most notably in the length of the abuse (&quot;nearly a year&quot; according to Goldschmidt, but three years according to &quot;Willamette Week&quot; at the time; it was later revealed by &quot;Willamette Week&quot; that the abuse actually continued through 1991, after Goldschmidt&#x27;s single term as governor) and in Goldschmidt&#x27;s use of the term &quot;affair&quot; to characterize it. &quot;The Oregonian&quot; was criticized for its coverage and use of the term &quot;affair&quot;. Writers and editors at &quot;The Oregonian&quot; acknowledged mistakes in their handling of the story, but denied that a desire to protect Goldschmidt motivated the mistakes. The &quot;Willamette Week&quot; article, written by Nigel Jaquiss, was awarded the 2005 Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting.

In his initial negotiations with &quot;Willamette Week&quot;, Goldschmidt agreed to resign his positions with the Texas Pacific Group and the Board of Higher Education, which he did. His decision in 1990 not to run for a second term as governor, long the subject of speculation, was finally explained. Further developments revealed that Goldschmidt was assisted by businessman Robert K. Burtchaell in keeping his molestation of the girl a secret. In return, Goldschmidt gave his support to Burtchaell&#x27;s (unsuccessful) bid to extend a lease for a houseboat moorage on the Willamette River.

Goldschmidt&#x27;s rabbi made an appeal in &quot;The Oregonian&quot; for forgiveness. Although Goldschmidt could no longer be prosecuted for the offense, the Oregon State Bar began an investigation into the matter. Goldschmidt submitted a Form B resignation, which was received by the bar on May 13, and rendered him ineligible for readmission.

Following complaints from local media over limited access to Goldschmidt&#x27;s public papers stored at the Oregon Historical Society (OHS), the state archivist announced May 29 that Goldschmidt would seize the 256 boxes of documents to guarantee public access as defined in a state law passed in 1973. That law required that public access to such records be maintained, but did not specify where the records be kept. Following Goldschmidt&#x27;s decision to put the documents in the care of the OHS, the state legislature passed a law requiring future governors to leave their documents in the state archives. Many records were published on the state archives&#x27; website in early 2005.

The scandal has affected numerous people and organizations associated with Goldschmidt. Many people have been accused of knowing of the crime, but failing to act accordingly. Debby Kennedy, who worked for Goldschmidt while he was governor, recalled, &quot;I just can&#x27;t tell you how many rumors there were about him then.&quot; Multnomah County Sheriff Bernie Giusto, who admitted knowing about the abuse, announced his early retirement in February 2008.

On March 7, 2011, the Oregon Senate President and Co-Speakers of the House released a statement that Goldschmidt&#x27;s Governor&#x27;s portrait had been removed from the walls of the State Capitol building in Salem and put into storage, out of respect for his victim, Elizabeth Lynn Dunham, who died from cancer on January 16, 2011, at the age of 49.

== Personal life ==
Goldschmidt married Margaret Wood in 1965. They had two children, Joshua and Rebecca, and divorced in 1990. Around the time he started his consulting firm, he met his second wife, Diana Snowden, who worked for PacifiCorp as a senior vice president.

Goldschmidt died from heart failure at his home in Portland, on June 12, 2024, at the age of 83, four days before his 84th birthday.

<doc id="371824" wikidata="Q6841525" url="?curid=371824" title="Middle Peninsula">
<text>The Middle Peninsula is the second of three large peninsulas on the western shore of Chesapeake Bay in Virginia. To the north the Rappahannock River separates it from the Northern Neck peninsula. To the south the York River separates it from the Virginia Peninsula. It encompasses six Virginia counties: Essex, Gloucester, King and Queen, King William, Mathews, and Middlesex. Developed for tobacco plantations in the colonial era, in the 21st century the Middle Peninsula is known for its quiet rural life, vegetable truck-farming, and fishing industry. As of the 2020 census, the Middle Peninsula was home to 92,886 people.

There are no cities on the Middle Peninsula and little industry. Among the towns found there, West Point has a pulp-and-paper mill. The unincorporated community of Deltaville is a popular spot for city-dwellers seeking a weekend boating on the bay. Tappahannock is a thriving community on the Rappahannock River, and Urbanna has a small but prosperous tourism industry.

Two small land reservations are home to the state-recognized Pamunkey and Mattaponi Indian tribes.

The primary highways on the peninsula are U.S. Route 17 (Tidewater Trail), which connects Fredericksburg with the Hampton Roads area, and U.S. Route 360 (Northumberland Highway), which connects the Northern Neck with Richmond and Danville. Before modern highways existed, passenger ferries and steam freighters linked the entire Chesapeake Bay region.

The two southernmost counties on the Middle Peninsula, Gloucester and Mathews, are now considered to be part of the Hampton Roads metropolitan area. Gloucester County is connected to the Virginia Peninsula by the George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge, which spans the York River. King William County and King and Queen County to the west are part of the Richmond Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA).

<text>Diction ( (nom. ), &quot;a saying, expression, word&quot;), in its original meaning, is a writer&#x27;s or speaker&#x27;s distinctive vocabulary choices and style of expression in a piece of writing such as a poem or story. In its common meaning, it is the distinctiveness of speech: the art of speaking so that each word is clearly heard and understood to its fullest complexity and extremity, and concerns pronunciation and tone, rather than word choice and style. This is more precisely and commonly expressed with the term enunciation or with its synonym, articulation.

Diction has multiple concerns, of which register, the adaptation of style and formality to the social context, is foremost. Literary diction analysis reveals how a passage establishes tone and characterization, e.g. a preponderance of verbs relating physical movement suggests an active character, while a preponderance of verbs relating states of mind portrays an introspective character. Diction also has an impact upon word choice and syntax.

Aristotle, in &quot;The Poetics&quot; (20), defines the parts of diction () as the letter, the syllable, the conjunction, the article, the noun, the verb, the case, and the speech (), though one commentator remarks that &quot;the text is so confused and some of the words have such a variety of meanings that one cannot always be certain what the Greek says, much less what Aristotle means.&quot;
==In literature==
Diction is usually judged in reference to the prevailing standards of proper writing and speech and is seen as the mark of quality of the writing. It is also understood as the selection of certain words or phrases that become peculiar to a writer or character.

;Example:

Certain writers in the modern day and age use archaic terms such as &quot;thy&quot;, &quot;thee&quot;, and &quot;wherefore&quot; to imbue a Shakespearean mood to their work.

Forms of diction include: archaic diction (diction that is antique, that is rarely used), high diction (lofty sounding language), and low diction (everyday language). Each of these forms is meant to enhance the meaning or artistry of an author&#x27;s work.

<doc id="371827" wikidata="Q16950569" url="?curid=371827" title="Hall v Durham Catholic School Board">
<text>Hall v Durham Catholic School Board was a 2002 court case in which Marc Hall, a Canadian teenager, fought a successful legal battle against the Durham Catholic District School Board to bring a same-sex date to his high school prom. The case made Canadian and international headlines.

==Legal case==
&quot;Hall v Durham Catholic School Board&quot; began when Oshawa, Ontario&#x27;s Monsignor John Pereyma Catholic Secondary School asked students attending the prom to submit the names of the guests they intended to bring. Hall, who is gay, submitted the name of his 21-year-old boyfriend, Jean-Paul Dumond, and was denied on the grounds that homosexuality is incompatible with Roman Catholic teaching.

Supported by his family and a wide variety of community organizations, Hall thus took the school board to court in a two-day hearing that began on May 6, 2002. Hall&#x27;s lawyer, David Corbett, argued that the denial of his request violated the Ontario Education Act, which requires school boards in the province not to discriminate. The school board, on the other hand, argued that court interference in its decision would amount to denying its religious freedom.

Corbett argued that an organization that accepts public funding (Catholic school boards in Ontario are fully funded in the same manner as public schools) has to be accountable to the same laws (including anti-discrimination laws) as other public institutions. The school board&#x27;s lawyer countered that Section 93 of the Canadian constitution protects the Catholic board&#x27;s rights to conduct its affairs in accordance with Catholic teaching.

In addition, Corbett noted that while extramarital sex is also contrary to Catholic teaching, the school board had previously allowed pregnant, unmarried students to attend the prom.

On May 10, Justice Robert McKinnon granted an interlocutory injunction ordering that Hall be allowed to attend the prom with Dumond and also that the school does not cancel the prom. He did not decide on the larger issues raised by the case, leaving those to be heard at a later trial. Hall attended the prom with Dumond that evening.

The case was set for trial in October 2005. In June 2005, Hall applied to discontinue the action and not proceed to trial; this was opposed by the school board, which desired a final judgement on the case. Hall&#x27;s application was granted by Justice Bryan Shaughnessy on June 28, 2005, thereby ending the case.

==In popular culture==
===Television===
Director Larry Peloso created a one-hour documentary on the case entitled &quot;Prom Fight: The Marc Hall Story&quot;. An unrelated television movie, &quot;Prom Queen: The Marc Hall Story&quot;, aired on CTV in 2004 with Aaron Ashmore starring as Hall.

Hall also appeared in the &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; season 2 finale as a party guest during the Rage party at Babylon.

Hall later recounted a story from the prom in the 2019 documentary film &quot;Take Me to Prom&quot;.

===Stage===
The case was adapted into a theatrical musical entitled &quot;Prom Queen,&quot; with songs by Colleen Dauncey and Akiva Romer-Segal.

&quot;The Louder We Get&quot;, originally produced as &quot;Prom Queen&quot;, debuted in Calgary, January 28-February 22, 2020 as part of the 2019-20 Theatre Calgary season.

===Literature===
Author Robert Joseph Greene referenced the court case in his book &quot;This High School Has Closets&quot;, where Marc Hall is seen as a hero to the main character.

<doc id="371830" wikidata="Q618324" url="?curid=371830" title="Durum wheat">
<text>Durum wheat (), also called pasta wheat or macaroni wheat (&quot;Triticum durum&quot; or &quot;Triticum turgidum&quot; subsp. &quot;durum&quot;), is a tetraploid species of wheat. It is the second most cultivated species of wheat after common wheat, although it represents only 5% to 8% of global wheat production. It was developed by artificial selection of the domesticated emmer wheat strains formerly grown in Central Europe and the Near East around 7000 BC, which developed a naked, free-threshing form. Like emmer, durum wheat is awned (with bristles). It is the predominant wheat that grows in the Middle East.

&quot;Durum&quot; in Latin means &#x27;hard&#x27;, and the species is the hardest of all wheats. This refers to the resistance of the grain to milling, in particular of the starchy endosperm, causing dough made from its flour to be weak or &quot;soft&quot;. This makes durum favorable for semolina and pasta and less practical for flour, which requires more work than with hexaploid wheats such as common bread wheats. Despite its high protein content, durum is not a strong wheat in the sense of giving strength to dough through the formation of a gluten network. Durum contains 27% extractable wet gluten, about 3% higher than common wheat (&quot;T. aestivum&quot; L.).

==Taxonomy==
Some authorities synonymize &quot;durum&quot; and &quot;Triticum turgidum&quot;. Some reserve &quot;durum&quot; for &quot;Triticum turgidum&quot; subsp. &quot;durum&quot;.

==Genetics==
Durum wheat is a tetraploid wheat, having four sets of chromosomes for a total of 28, unlike hard red winter and hard red spring wheats, which are hexaploid (six sets of chromosomes) for a total of 42.

Durum wheat originated through intergeneric hybridization and polyploidization involving two diploid (having two sets of chromosomes) grass species: &quot;T. urartu&quot; (2n=2x=14, AA genome) and a B-genome diploid related to &quot;Aegilops speltoides&quot; (2n=2x=14, SS genome) and is thus an allotetraploid (having four sets of chromosomes, from unlike parents) species.

Durum—and indeed all tetraploids—lack &quot;&quot; alleles. The only exception is found by Buerstmayr &quot;et al.&quot;, 2012 on the .

One of the predominant production areas of durum—Italy—has domesticated varieties with lower genetic diversity than wild types, but ssp. &quot;turanicum&quot;, ssp. &quot;polonicum&quot; and ssp. &quot;carthlicum&quot; have a level of diversity intermediate between those groups. There is evidence of an increase in the intensity of breeding after 1990.

==Uses==
Commercially produced dry pasta, or , is made almost exclusively from durum semolina. Most home-made fresh pastas also use durum wheat or a combination of soft and hard wheats.

Husked but unground, or coarsely ground, it is used to produce the semolina in the couscous of North Africa and the Levant. It is also used for Levantine dishes such as &quot;tabbouleh&quot;, &quot;kashk&quot;, &quot;kibbeh&quot;, &quot;bitfun&quot; and the &quot;bulgur&quot; for pilafs. In North African cuisine and Levantine cuisine, it forms the basis of many soups, gruels, stuffings, puddings and pastries. When ground as fine as flour, it is used for making bread. In the Middle East, it is used for flat round breads, and in Europe and elsewhere, it can be used for pizza or &quot;torte&quot;.

The use of wheat to produce pasta was described as early as the 10th century by Ibn Wahshīya of Cairo. The North Africans called the product &quot;itrīya&quot;, from which Italian sources derived the term &quot;tria&quot; (or &quot;aletría&quot; in the case of Spanish sources) during the 15th century.

==Production==

&quot;Durum wheat&quot; (&quot;Triticum turgidum&quot; ssp. &quot;durum&quot;) is the 10th most cultivated cereal worldwide, with a total production of about 38 million tons.

Most of the durum grown today is amber durum, the grains of which are amber-colored due to the extra carotenoid pigments and are larger than those of other types of wheat. Durum has a yellow endosperm, which gives pasta its color. When durum is milled, the endosperm is ground into a granular product called semolina. Semolina made from durum is used for premium pastas and breads. Notably semolina is also one of the only flours that is purposely oxidized for flavor and color. There is also a red durum, used mostly for livestock feed.

The cultivation of durum generates greater yield than other wheats in areas of low precipitation. Good yields can be obtained by irrigation, but this is rarely done. In the first half of the 20th century, the crop was widely grown in Russia. Durum is one of the most important food crops in West Asia. Although the variety of the wheat there is diverse, it is not extensively grown there, and thus must be imported. West amber durum produced in Canada is used mostly as semolina/pasta, but some is also exported to Italy for bread production.

In the Middle East and North Africa, local bread-making accounts for half the consumption of durum. Some flour is even imported. On the other hand, many countries in Europe produce durum in commercially significant quantities.

In India durum accounts for roughly 5% of total wheat production in the country, and is used to make products such as rava and sooji.

===Processing and protein content===
Durum wheat is subject to four processes: cleaning, tempering, milling and purifying. First, durum wheat is cleaned to remove foreign material and shrunken and broken kernels. Then it is tempered to a moisture content, toughening the seed coat for efficient separation of bran and endosperm. Durum milling is a complex procedure involving repetitive grinding and sieving. Proper purifying results in maximum semolina yield and the least amount of bran powder.

To produce bread, durum wheat is ground into flour. The flour is mixed with water to produce dough. The quantities mixed vary, depending on the acidity of the mixture. To produce fluffy bread, the dough is mixed with yeast and lukewarm water, heavily kneaded to form a gas-retaining gluten network, and then fermented for hours, producing bubbles.

The quality of the bread produced depends on the viscoelastic properties of gluten, the protein content and protein composition. Containing about 12% total protein in defatted flour compared to 11% in common wheat, durum wheat yields 27% extractable, wet gluten compared to 24% in common wheat.

==Health concerns==

Because durum wheat contains gluten, it is unsuitable for people with gluten-related disorders such as celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy.

<text>Stanhopea is a genus of the orchid family (Orchidaceae) from Central and South America. The abbreviation used in horticultural trade is &quot;Stan.&quot; The genus is named for the 4th Earl of Stanhope (Philip Henry Stanhope) (1781-1855), president of the Medico-Botanical Society of London (1829-1837). It comprises 55 species and 5 natural hybrids. These epiphytic, but occasionally terrestrial orchids can be found in damp forests from Mexico to Trinidad to NW Argentina. Their ovate pseudobulbs carry from the top one long, plicate, elliptic leaf.

&quot;Stanhopea&quot; is noted for its complex and usually fragrant flowers that are generally spectacular and short-lived. Their pendant inflorescences are noted for flowering out of the bottom of the containers in which they grow, lending themselves to culture in baskets that have enough open space for the inflorescence to push through. They are sometimes called upside-down orchids.

The majority of species are robust plants that grow readily in cultivation. For relatives of &quot;Stanhopea&quot; see Stanhopeinae and the closely related sister subtribe Coeliopsidinae.

== Description ==
Most &quot;Stanhopea&quot; flowers flash prominent, elegant horns on the epichile. The exception are the species; &quot;S. annulata&quot;, &quot;S. avicula&quot;, &quot;S. cirrhata&quot;, &quot;S. ecornuta&quot; and &quot;S. pulla&quot;. A second group have short or truncated horns, they include the species; &quot;S. candida&quot;, &quot;S. grandiflora&quot;, &quot;S. reichenbachiana&quot;, &quot;S. tricornis&quot; and the natural hybrid &quot;S. x herrenhusana&quot;. The structure of the labellum of this group is in general, not as complex as other members of the genus.

With most &quot;Stanhopea&quot; flowers lasting three days or less, the flowers must attract pollinators very quickly. These chemical attractants are generated in the hypochile, attracting the male euglossine bees to the flower. These male euglossine bees are known to be important pollinators of &quot;Stanhopea&quot; flowers, collecting fragrances at these flowers over their lifetime and storing them in their hind tibia. Bees in the Euglossini tribe, including &quot;Eulaema meriana&quot;, are known to pollinate these flowers supposedly because the orchids can deceptively mimic the form of a female and her sex pheromone. When the bee touches down on the flower, a great effort is made to collect chemical scent - he eventually slides on the waxy surface of the hypochile, gliding down on the slippery lip to exit the flower. The long column is touched in the process, resulting in the bee taking up pollinia at the very tip of the column. When the bee slides down another flower, the pollinia are deposited on the sticky surface of the stigma.

<doc id="371838" wikidata="Q1152899" url="?curid=371838" title="Enhanced Versatile Disc">
<text>The Enhanced Versatile Disc (EVD) is an optical-medium-based digital audio/video format, developed by Beijing E-World (a multi-company partnership including SVA, Shinco, Xiaxin, Yuxing, Skyworth, Nintaus, Malata, Changhong, and BBK Electronics), as a rival to the DVD to avoid the high royalty costs associated with the DVD format. Its development was supported by the Chinese government. While it was intended to replace the DVD standard in China by 2008, the format had failed to gain traction and ultimately faded into obsolescence.

It was announced on November 18, 2003, by the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s Xinhua News Agency as a response to the DVD-Video format and its licensing costs (which some considered excessive). It uses an optical storage medium in CD size (120 mm) that is physically a DVD disc with the same UDF file system. China started development on EVD in 1999, because DVD Video (CSS, Macrovision, etc.) and MPEG-2 (Video and Systems) licensing costs were relatively high—reportedly in the range of $13–$20 USD per hardware video player. Soon after, Prototype EVD discs and software players were presented in April 2004. As the disc is physically a DVD it could be read with any computer DVD drive. Successful copies were made with DVD-R discs. Despite its versatility, the number of films ever offered in the format was very limited.

The audio codec was to come from Coding Technologies and was called the EAC (Enhanced Audio Codec) 2.0. It is the successor of a prior design known as EAC and works on the basis of spectral band replication. EAC 2.0 supports mono, stereo and 5.1 surround sound. The original plan was that the video codecs VP5 and VP6 from On2 Technologies would be used. These are more efficient than MPEG-2 Video and could enable the disc to store HDTV resolutions, which the standard DVD format does not support. With EVD, royalties to On2 for the VP6 codec part of the EVD design were anticipated to be about US$2 per video player (a much lower fee than that associated with MPEG-2 Video). However, a contract dispute rapidly developed between On2 and Beijing E-World (the consortium of companies developing the EVD format). On2 announced in April 2004 that it was not being properly paid and would file multiple breach of contract claims against E-World for arbitration. Approximately one year later, the arbitrator dismissed all of On2&#x27;s claims and ruled that nothing was owed to On2, primarily because no significant number of player devices had ever been produced by the E-World companies. While the EVD format design including VP6 had been proposed to the Chinese government to become a standard, the effort appears to have stalled at that point and no further progress is evident. Following this, very little news was available about EVD until December 6, 2006, when 20 Chinese electronic firms unveiled 54 prototype EVD players, announcing their intention to fully switch to this format by 2008 in an effort to decrease dependency on foreign electronic products and establish a niche in the market. While many devices were made, the format failed to replace the DVD standard.

The Chinese government had reported the overcoming of development, chip-design and production problems with EVD. The team had applied for 25 patents, of which at least seven have been granted. While Beijing E-World sought widespread adoption for the EVD, the format has not had any new compatible hardware released since 2008.

<text>Adolfo Aguilar Zínser ( – ) was a Mexican scholar, diplomat and politician who served as a National Security Advisor to President Vicente Fox and as a UN Security Council Ambassador in the midst of the US invasion of Iraq.

Born in Mexico City into an upper-class family, Adolfo Aguilar was the son of Adolfo Aguilar y Quevedo a criminal lawyer and Carmen Zínser, a philanthropist. He was also the great-grandson of Miguel Ángel de Quevedo &quot;El apóstol del árbol&quot; (&quot;Apostle of trees&quot;), considered the first environmentalist in Mexico and Ángela Quevedo de Aguilar a philanthropist.

Aguilar studied law at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, international relations at El Colegio de México (1972–75) and completed a master&#x27;s degree in international and public affairs at Harvard Kennedy School (1977–78). During the early seventies he briefly subscribed to Marxist ideology, and he headed Luis Echeverría&#x27;s Center for Economic and Social Studies of the Third World during the mid-1970s.

He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, representing the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) in 1994 and served until 1997. From 1997 to 2000 he served in the Senate, representing the Green Ecological Party of Mexico (PVEM).

Following Vicente Fox&#x27;s election to the Presidency (representing a coalition of the National Action Party and the PVEM) on July 2, 2000, Aguilar served as the transition team&#x27;s advisor on international affairs. After taking office, Fox appointed Aguilar his national security advisor.

In January 2002, Fox appointed Aguilar Mexico&#x27;s permanent representative to the United Nations. His term coincided with Mexico&#x27;s election to the Security Council and, in accordance with the Security Council&#x27;s rules of procedure, he served as its president for two one-month terms.

Following a speech to students at Mexico City&#x27;s Ibero-American University on November 11, 2003, in which Aguilar claimed that the political and intellectual class of the United States sees Mexico as &quot;a country whose position is that of a back yard&quot; &quot;(patio trasero)&quot; and that Washington was interested in only &quot;a relationship of convenience and subordination&quot; and &quot;a weekend fling&quot; &quot;(un noviazgo de fin de semana)&quot;, President Fox requested his resignation on 18 November. Two days later, Aguilar announced his resignation in writing accusing Fox of treason and submission to US interests. Aguilar saw nothing controversial in his speech, considering it &quot;obvious and historical&quot;; it was, however, spun in the media to imply that Aguilar himself believed that Mexico was the US&#x27;s backyard and was thus unworthy to represent the country at the UN. The speech served as a pretext to fire him and placate the US, although Mexico never gave the US what it wanted: support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

After leaving the UN, Aguilar received an honorary degree from Ricardo Palma University (Peru) and hosted a weekly current-affairs show on television. He died in a car accident near his summer chalet in Tepoztlán, Morelos, on June 5, 2005, at the age of 55.

In the run-up to the fifth anniversary of the Iraq War he was the subject of an episode of the BBC series &quot;10 Days to War&quot;, in which he was played by Tom Conti.

<text>In the United States, the term hyphenated American refers to the use of a hyphen (in some styles of writing) between the name of an ethnicity and the word in compound nouns, e.g., as in . Calling a person a &quot;hyphenated American&quot; was used as an insult alleging divided political or national loyalties, especially in times of war. It was used from 1890 to 1920 to disparage Americans who were of foreign birth or ancestry and who displayed an affection for their ancestral heritage language and culture. It was most commonly used during World War I against Americans from White ethnic backgrounds who favored United States neutrality during the ongoing conflict or who opposed the idea of an American military alliance with the British Empire and the creation of what is now called the &quot;Special Relationship&quot;, even for purely political reasons. 

In this context, the term &quot;the hyphen&quot; was a metonymical reference to this kind of ethnicity descriptor, and &quot;dropping the hyphen&quot; referred to full integration into the American identity. Some contemporary critics of this concept, such as Randolph Bourne in his criticism of the Preparedness Movement, accused America&#x27;s White Anglo-Saxon Protestant elite of hypocrisy, Anglophilia, mimicry of the British upper class, and showing the same divided loyalty in pushing for the &quot;Special Relationship&quot; that they refused to tolerate in others. Other contemporaries, like Bishop John Joseph Frederick Otto Zardetti, argued eloquently that there is no contradiction between American patriotism and loyalty to one&#x27;s ancestral culture, religion, and heritage language. In a 1916 letter to the &quot;Minneapolis Journal&quot;, one Minnesota German-American suggested that his own people would willingly &quot;abandon the hyphen&quot;, but only if &quot;Anglo-Americans&quot; did so first. 

Contemporary studies and debates refer to Hyphenated-American identities to discuss issues such as multiculturalism and immigration in the U.S. political climate; however, the term &quot;hyphen&quot; is rarely used per the recommendation of modern style guides. In their 2018 biography of Dominican-American poetess Rhina Espaillat, who is known for encouraging both bilingualism and American patriotism among younger people who speak immigrant languages, Nancy Kang and Silvio Torres-Saillant criticized how, in American political discourse for decades after Espaillat&#x27;s 1938 arrival as a political refugee in the United States, both the English only movement and, &quot;the expectation that one should &quot;overcome&quot; any non-British ancestral origins, still held sway as a prerequisite to entering the sphere of genuine Americanness&quot;. Both authors also singled out the role of Woodrow Wilson and his Pueblo speech in the lengthy survival of these concepts for special criticism.

== Hyphenated Americanism, 1890–1920 ==

The term &quot;hyphenated American&quot; was published by 1889, and was common as a derogatory term by 1904. During World War I, the issue arose of the primary political loyalty of ethnic groups who retained close ties to their relatives in Europe, especially German Americans. In 1915, former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt in speaking to the largely Irish Catholic Knights of Columbus at Carnegie Hall on Columbus Day, asserted that,
President Woodrow Wilson regarded &quot;hyphenated Americans&quot; with suspicion, saying in his Pueblo speech: &quot;Any man who carries a hyphen about with him carries a dagger that he is ready to plunge into the vitals of this Republic whenever he gets ready.&quot; In the 1920s, the Wall Street Journal condemned &quot;hyphenates&quot; who were said to be among the supporters of the Progressive Party&#x27;s Robert M. La Follette Jr..

A vocal source of criticism of Roosevelt and Wilson&#x27;s &quot;anti-hyphen&quot; ideology and particularly to their demands for &quot;100 percent Americanism&quot; came, quite understandably, from America&#x27;s enormous number of White ethnic immigrants and their descendants. Criticism from these circles occasionally argued that &quot;100 percent Americanism&quot; really meant Anglophilia and a push for what is now called the Special Relationship between the United States and the British Empire, as particularly demonstrated by Roosevelt, Wilson, John R. Rathom and other leaders of the demand to only tolerate White Anglo-Saxon Protestant culture and the English language in the United States. 

A prime example of this criticism, which argued that there is no contradiction between preserving ancestral heritage languages and American patriotism may be seen in Bishop John Joseph Frederick Otto Zardetti&#x27;s 21 September 1892 &quot;Sermon on the Mother and the Bride&quot;, which is a defence of German-Americans desire to preserve their ancestral culture and to continue speaking the German language in the United States, against both the English only movement and accusations of being Hyphenated Americans.

Zardetti&#x27;s argument is further supported and strengthened by the fact that Francis Scott Key&#x27;s lyrics to the U.S. national anthem, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, have seen multiple literary translations into immigrant languages that are able to be successfully sung to the same melody. In 1861, very likely to help encourage German-American military service in the Union Army and the Navy during the American Civil War, the lyrics were translated into the German language in the United States and widely circulated in pamphlet form. The Library of Congress also has record of a Spanish-language version from 1919. It has since been translated into Hebrew and Yiddish by Jewish immigrants, Latin American Spanish (with one version popularized during immigration reform protests in 2006), Louisiana French by the Cajun people, the Irish language, and Scottish Gaelic.

Furthermore, in a letter published on July 16, 1916, in the &quot;Minneapolis Journal&quot;, Edward Goldbeck, a member of Minnesota&#x27;s traditionally very large German-American community, sarcastically announced that his people would, &quot;abandon the hyphen&quot;, as soon as English-Americans did so. Meanwhile, he argued, &quot;Let the exodus of Anglo-Americans start at once! Let all those people go who think that America is a new England!&quot;

== Hyphenated American identities ==

Some groups recommend dropping the hyphen because it implies to some people dual nationalism and the inability to be accepted as truly American. The Japanese American Citizens League is supportive of dropping the hyphen because the non-hyphenated form uses their ancestral origin as an adjective for &quot;American&quot;.

By contrast, other groups have embraced the hyphen, arguing that the American identity is compatible with alternative identities and that the mixture of identities within the United States strengthens the nation rather than weakens it.

&quot;European American&quot;, as opposed to White or Caucasian, has been coined in response to the increasing racial and ethnic diversity of the United States, as well as to this diversity moving more into the mainstream of the society in the latter half of the twentieth century. The term distinguishes whites of European ancestry from those of other ancestries. In 1977, it was proposed that the term &quot;European American&quot; replace &quot;white&quot; as a racial label in the U.S. census, although this was not done. The term &quot;European American&quot; is not in common use in the United States among the general public or in the mass media, and the terms &quot;white&quot; or &quot;white American&quot; are commonly used instead.

=== Usage of the hyphen ===

Modern style guides, such as &quot;AP Stylebook&quot;, recommend dropping the hyphen between the two names; some, including &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; (CMOS), recommend dropping the hyphen even for the adjective form. On the other hand, &quot;The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage&quot; allows compounds with name fragments (bound morphemes), such as and , but not &quot;Jewish American&quot; or &quot;French Canadian&quot;.

==== American English ====

The first term typically indicates a region or culture of origin paired with . Examples:
* Region, the continent or race: African Americans, Asian Americans, South Asian Americans, European Americans, Hispanic Americans, Middle Eastern Americans, Native Americans, Pacific Islander Americans, etc.
* Ethnicity or nationality: Arab American, Armenian American, Bangladeshi American, British American, Chinese American, Colombian American, Cuban American, Danish American, Dominician American, Dutch American, English American, Ethiopian American, Filipino American, French American, German American, Greek American, Haitian American, Indian American, Iranian Americans, Irish American, Italian American, Japanese American, Jamaican American, Jewish American, Korean American, Mexican American, Norwegian American, Pakistani American, Polish American, Russian American, Scottish American, Spanish American, Swedish American, Thai American, Turkish American, Ukrainian American, Vietnamese American, Welsh American, etc.

The hyphen is occasionally but not consistently employed when the compound term is used as an adjective. Academic style guides (including APA, ASA, MLA, and &quot;Chicago Manual&quot;) do not use a hyphen in these compounds even when they are used as adjectives.

The linguistic construction functionally indicates ancestry, but also may connote a sense that these individuals straddle two worlds—one experience is specific to their unique ethnic identity, while the other is the broader multicultural amalgam that is Americana.

==== Relative to Latin America ====
Latin America includes most of the Western Hemisphere south of the United States, including Mexico, Central America, South America, and (in some cases) the Caribbean. United States nationals with origins in Latin America are often referred to as Hispanic or Latino Americans, or by their specific country of origin, e.g., Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans.

<text>Browne Falls is a waterfall above Doubtful Sound, which is located in Fiordland National Park, New Zealand. In a temperate rain forest, the falls cascade down to the fiord near Hall Arm. Heights of 619 metres and 836 metres have been given for the falls.
Their source is a tarn called Lake Browne (836 m above sea level) which when full, overflows down the side of the mountain face (similar to Sutherland&#x27;s source). The stream makes 836 m height difference over 1,130 m horizontal difference, thus the mean gradient of stream is 42 degrees. This comparatively low angle makes the falls less impressive.

The falls are one of the two candidates for the title of New Zealand&#x27;s highest waterfall. The other is sourced from a tarn behind Elizabeth Island which is also in Fiordland.

The falls are named after pioneering aerial photographer, Victor Carlyle Browne, who discovered Lake Browne and the associated falls on one of his flights over Fiordland in the 1940s.

There are at least two other notable waterfalls falling to Doubtful Sound: Helena Falls and Lady Alice Falls.

==Natural history==
There is a diversity of plant and birdlife in the vicinity and watershed of Browne Falls. Extensive stands of nothofagus dominated trees are present along with a wide variety of understory ferns and shrubs; examples of the forest floor vegetation include crown fern (&quot;Lomaria discolor&quot;).

<doc id="371851" wikidata="Q4934690" url="?curid=371851" title="Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus">
<text>Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus, 210 U.S. 339 (1908), was a United States Supreme Court decision concerning the scope of rights accorded owners of a copyright versus owners of a particular copy of a copyrighted work. This was a case of first impression concerning whether the copyright laws permit an owner to control a purchaser&#x27;s subsequent sale of a copyrighted work. The court stated the issue as:
Does the sole right to vend (named in 4952) secure to the owner of the copyright the right, after a sale of the book to a purchaser, to restrict future sales of the book at retail, to the right to sell it at a certain price per copy, because of a notice in the book that a sale at a different price will be treated as an infringement, which notice has been brought home to one undertaking to sell for less than the named sum?

The case centered on the publisher setting additional terms not specifically stated in the statute and claiming that the work was licensed and not sold. The Court&#x27;s ruling established what came to be known as the &quot;first-sale doctrine&quot;, which was later codified as § 109(a) of the Copyright Act of 1976.

==Facts==
Bobbs-Merrill Company sold a copyrighted novel, &quot;The Castaway&quot; by Hallie Erminie Rives, with the notice, &quot;The price of this book at retail is $1 net. No dealer is licensed to sell it at a lower price, and a sale at a lower price will be treated as an infringement of the copyright&quot; printed immediately below the copyright notice. The defendants, Isidor and Nathan Straus representing R.H. Macy &amp; Co., purchased large lots of books at wholesale and sold copies of the book at retail at the price of 89 cents a copy.

==Holding==
The court held first that the copyright statutes protect an owner&#x27;s right to &quot;multiply and sell&quot; the work on their own terms. The statutory right to sell, however, did not also create a right to limit resale.

The court did not hold that a contract or license imposed on the first sale could not create an obligation. In this case, there was no contract between the owner and the original purchaser, and there was not privity of contract between the owner and any third party.

<doc id="371853" wikidata="Q470086" url="?curid=371853" title="Kellie Waymire">
<text>Kellie Suzanne Waymire (July 27, 1967 – November 13, 2003) was an American stage, television, and film actress. She was known for her television roles on &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, and &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Waymire was born in Columbus, Ohio to Jack and Vickie Waymire. She had two siblings, Tony and Rebecca. The family moved frequently, living in Lake Tahoe, Nevada; Denver, Colorado; Tampa, Florida; and Houston, Texas. In Houston, Waymire attended Lamar High School where she became interested in acting and was the drama club&#x27;s president. She then attended Southern Methodist University (SMU) where she won the Greer Garson Award.

Waymire completed a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Theater at SMU, and earned a Master of Fine Arts from the University of California, San Diego in 1993.

==Career==
After graduating from college, Waymire moved to New York City. She began her television career in the role of Emily Haynes on the soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; in 1994.

In 1997, she moved to Los Angeles and continued her career in a number of primetime television shows, including &quot;The Practice&quot;, &quot;Judging Amy&quot;, &quot;The X-Files&quot;, &quot;Wolf Lake&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, and &quot;Yes Dear&quot;.

Waymire was predominantly cast in offbeat or humorous roles. Two of her highest-profile roles were recurring ones on &quot;Six Feet Under,&quot; where she played Melissa, a prostitute; and on &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise, as&quot; Crewman Elizabeth Cutler. She had previously portrayed the role of Lanya in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; in the episode &quot;Muse&quot;. She guest-starred in the Season 9 &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Blood&quot;, as a sickly mother who wants someone to take care of her son in the event of her death.

In 2003, Waymire was cast as a regular in the short-lived Fox sitcom &quot;The Pitts&quot;.
It was canceled after four weeks. Among her final onscreen roles were guest spots on &quot;Friends&quot; (in the episode &quot;The One Where Ross Is Fine&quot;, aired a month before her death), &quot;Everwood&quot;, and &quot;Wonderfalls&quot;, the last two of which aired after her death. The latter was dedicated to her memory. She appeared in a number of feature films, including a role as Jane in the comedy-drama &quot;Playing by Heart&quot; (1998).

In addition to her film and television work, Waymire was active in regional theater around the United States. She played the lead in A.R. Gurney&#x27;s play &quot;Sylvia&quot; at San Diego&#x27;s Old Globe Theatre in 1996. She appeared in a revival of the Noël Coward play &quot;Present Laughter&quot; at the Pasadena Playhouse in 1998, and in many other stage productions across the country. At the time of her death, she was starring as Anne in the stage adaptation of &quot;Kate Crackernuts&quot; at the 24th Street Theatre in Los Angeles.

==Death==
On November 13, 2003, Waymire died in her home in Venice, Los Angeles, California of cardiac arrest caused by an undiagnosed cardiac arrhythmia, likely related to mitral valve prolapse, a condition with which she had been diagnosed as a teenager. Her funeral was held on November 23, 2003, in West Milton, Ohio. Her partner at the time of her death was actor and Ovation Award winning set designer Gary Judson Smoot.

On December 8, 2003, a public memorial was held at the Ralph Freud Playhouse, housed in Macgowan Hall at UCLA.

The Kellie Waymire Scholarship Fund, through the UC San Diego Foundation, was established in her honor.

<doc id="371860" wikidata="Q221670" url="?curid=371860" title="Treaty of the Pyrenees">
<text>The Treaty of the Pyrenees was signed on 7 November 1659 and ended the Franco-Spanish War that had begun in 1635.

Negotiations were conducted and the treaty was signed on Pheasant Island, situated in the middle of the Bidasoa River on the border between the two countries, which has remained a French-Spanish condominium ever since. It was signed by Louis XIV of France and Philip IV of Spain, as well as their chief ministers, Cardinal Mazarin and Don Luis Méndez de Haro.

==Background==
thumb|300px|Territorial cessions made under the Treaty of the Pyrenees.
France entered the Thirty Years&#x27; War after the Spanish Habsburg victories in the Dutch Revolt in the 1620s and at the Battle of Nördlingen against Sweden in 1634. By 1640, France began to interfere in Spanish politics, aiding the revolt in Catalonia, while Spain responded by aiding the Fronde revolt in France in 1648. During the negotiations for the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, France gained the Sundgau and cut off Spanish access to the Netherlands from Austria, and leading to an increase in hostilities between the French and Spanish.

An Anglo-French alliance was victorious at the Battle of the Dunes on 14 June 1658, but the following year the war ground to a halt when the French campaign to take Milan was defeated. Peace was settled by means of the Treaty of the Pyrenees in November 1659.

==Content==

France gained Roussillon (including Perpignan) and the northern half of Cerdanya, Montmédy and other parts of Luxembourg, Artois and other towns in Flanders, including Arras, Béthune, Gravelines and Thionville, and a new border with Spain was fixed at the Pyrenees. However, the treaty stipulated only that all &quot;villages&quot; north of the Pyrenees should become part of France. Because it was a town, Llívia, once the capital of Cerdanya, was thus unintentionally exempted from the treaty and became a Spanish exclave as part of the &quot;comarca&quot; of Baixa Cerdanya, in the Spanish province of Girona. This border was not properly settled until the Treaty of Bayonne was signed in 1856, with its final acts accepted 12 years later. On the western Pyrenees a definite borderline was drawn and decisions made as to the politico-administrative affiliation of bordering areas in the Basque region—Baztan, Aldude, Valcarlos.

Spain was forced to recognize and confirm all of the French gains at the Peace of Westphalia. In exchange for the Spanish territorial losses, the French king pledged to quit his support for Portugal and renounced his claim to the Principality of Catalonia, which the French crown had claimed ever since the Catalan Revolt, also known as the Reapers&#x27; War. The Portuguese revolt in 1640, led by the Duke of Braganza, was supported monetarily by Cardinal Richelieu of France. After the Catalan Revolt, France had controlled the Principality of Catalonia from January 1641, when a combined Catalan and French force defeated the Spanish army at Battle of Montjuïc, until it was defeated by a Spanish army at Barcelona in 1652. Though the Spanish army reconquered most of Catalonia, the French retained Catalan territory north of the Pyrenees.

The treaty also arranged for a marriage between Louis XIV of France and Maria Theresa of Spain, the daughter of Philip IV of Spain. Maria Theresa was forced to renounce her claim to the Spanish throne, in return for a monetary settlement as part of her dowry. This settlement was never paid, a factor that eventually led to the War of Devolution in 1667. At the Meeting on the Isle of Pheasants in June 1660, the two monarchs and their ministers met, and the princess entered France.

In addition, the English received Dunkirk, although they elected to sell it to France in 1662.

==Consequences==

The Treaty of the Pyrenees was the last major diplomatic achievement by Cardinal Mazarin. Combined with the Peace of Westphalia, it allowed Louis XIV remarkable stability and diplomatic advantage by means of a weakened Louis, Grand Condé and a weakened Spanish Crown, along with the agreed dowry, which was an important element in the French king&#x27;s strategy.

All in all, by 1660, when the Swedish occupation of Poland was over, most of the European continent was at peace (though the third stage of the Portuguese Restoration War would soon begin), and the Bourbons had ended the dominance of the Habsburgs. In the Pyrenees, the treaty resulted in the establishment of border customs and restriction of the free cross-border flow of people and goods. The treaty also settled indefinitely the century and half long litigation over the Kingdom of Navarre, while the dispute over the Aldudes remained in place still throughout the 18th century.

===French annexations===

In the context of the territorial changes involved in the treaty, France gained some territory, on both its northern and southern borders.

*In the north, France gained the County of Artois and smaller areas along its north-east border with the Holy Roman Empire.
*In the south: 
::# On the east: the northern part of the Principality of Catalonia, including Roussillon, Conflent, Vallespir, Capcir, and French Cerdagne, was transferred to France, i.e. what later came to be known as &quot;Northern Catalonia&quot;.
::# On the west: the parties agreed to put together a field group to compromise a borderline on disputed lands along the Basque Pyrenees, involving Sareta—Zugarramurdi, Ainhoa, etc.— Aldude, and the Spanish wedge of Valcarlos.

<text>The Sunsphere is a tall hexagonal steel truss structure located in World&#x27;s Fair Park in downtown Knoxville, Tennessee, United States. It is topped with the gold-colored glass sphere that served as the symbol of the 1982 World&#x27;s Fair. Directly across a man-made pond from the Tennessee Amphitheater, they are the only remaining structures from the fair.

==Design==
Designed by the Knoxville-based architectural firm Community Tectonics, the Sunsphere was noted for its unique design in several engineering publications. It was originally to have had a diameter of symbolically that of the hypothetical diameter of the disc of the Sun. The tower&#x27;s window glass panels are layered in 24-karat gold dust and cut to seven different shapes. It weighs and features six double steel truss columns in supporting the seven-story sphere. The tower has a volume of and a surface of .

==History==
During the fair it cost to take the elevator to the tower&#x27;s observation deck. The tower served as a restaurant and featured food items such as the &quot;Sunburger&quot; and a rum and fruit juice cocktail called the &quot;Sunburst&quot;. In the early morning hours on May 12, 1982, a shot was fired from outside the fair site and shattered one of the sphere&#x27;s windows. No one was arrested for the incident.

The Sunsphere has been used as a symbol for Knoxville, appearing in postcards and logos. Between 1993 and 1999, the Sunsphere was featured in part on the logo for the Knoxville Smokies minor league baseball club. The 2002 AAU Junior Olympics mascot &quot;Spherit&quot; took its inspiration from the landmark. It featured red hair and a body shaped like the Sunsphere. On Sunday, May 14, 2000, nuclear weapons protesters scaled the tower and hung a large banner saying &quot;Stop the Bombs&quot;. They remained on the tower for three days before surrendering to police.

==Redevelopment==
In March 1991, officials from the Pensacola Tornados of the Continental Basketball Association were looking at Knoxville for possible location and said of the Sunsphere as potential office space, &quot;What better place for basketball offices than a giant gold basketball in the sky.&quot;

In March 1994 the World&#x27;s Fair Park Development Committee sought to reopen the Sunsphere as a restaurant (similar to Seattle&#x27;s Space Needle, which features a restaurant at the top): CEB Enterprises would have opened a casual dining restaurant called World&#x27;s Fare Restaurant; Cierra Restaurant Group would have opened a fine dining restaurant. Both proposals failed.
The Sunsphere was proposed to be included as part of the new Knoxville Convention Center. While not physically incorporated into the final design, the Convention Center was designed with an open curve along its north edge to allow access to the Sunsphere. During construction of the Convention Center, the observation deckwhich the city had briefly reopened, still sporting the original World&#x27;s Fair-era displays and explanations of the panoramawas closed while the tower was commandeered by the Knoxville Public Building Authority as offices for, quite literally, overseeing construction of the Convention Center.

==Reopening==
The Level 4 observation deck was reopened on July 5, 2007, to give visitors a view of Knoxville. The observation deck can hold 86 people. At the time of its reopening, Level5 became a cafe with concession and an early evening drinks service. Level6 served as an open space leased out for functions. As of October 2013, both the 7th and 8th floors are available for commercial rental.

On August 27, 2008, the 5th floor was opened as the SkyBox bar and lounge. It eventually closed, however, and real estate investor Tony Capiello opened Icon Ultra Lounge in its place, investing $450,000.

In June 2013, a patron accidentally broke an inside window; nobody was hurt. On November 13, 2013, it was announced that Visit Knoxville would update and renovate the 4th floor of the observation deck.

The Sunsphere observation deck was closed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Visit Knoxville reopened the Sunsphere observation deck on February 22, 2022. The floor offers a 360-degree view stretching from downtown to the Great Smoky Mountains, including World&#x27;s Fair Park, the Tennessee River, and the University of Tennessee Campus. Visitors can also view a 1982 World&#x27;s Fair timeline, gallery, memorabilia, and gift shop.

==In popular culture==
A March 1996 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Bart on the Road&quot;, features the Sunsphere. Bart and three friends (Nelson, Martin, and Milhouse) travel to Knoxville to visit the World&#x27;s Fair, only to learn they are over a decade too late. In the episode, the Sunsphere has become a dilapidated storage warehouse for a wig store called the Wigsphere. Nelson then throws a rock at the Sunsphere, causing it to topple over and land on top of their rental car, destroying it and stranding them in Knoxville.

The Sunsphere has also been called &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Golf Tee&quot;.

<text>Paul Hamilton Williams Jr. (born September 19, 1940) is an American composer, singer, songwriter, and actor. He is known for writing and co-writing popular songs performed by a number of acts in the 1970s, including Three Dog Night&#x27;s &quot;An Old Fashioned Love Song&quot; and &quot;Out in the Country&quot;, Helen Reddy&#x27;s &quot;You and Me Against the World&quot;, Biff Rose&#x27;s &quot;Fill Your Heart&quot;, and the Carpenters&#x27; &quot;We&#x27;ve Only Just Begun&quot; and &quot;Rainy Days and Mondays&quot;. He also wrote &quot;Cried Like a Baby&quot; for teen idol Bobby Sherman.

Williams is also known for writing the score and lyrics for &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; (1976) and his musical contributions to other films, including the Oscar-nominated song &quot;Rainbow Connection&quot; from &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;, and writing the lyrics to the #1 chart-topping song &quot;Evergreen&quot;, the love theme from the Barbra Streisand film &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;, for which he won a Grammy for Song of the Year and an Academy Award for Best Original Song. He wrote the lyrics to the opening theme for the television show &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, with music previously composed by Charles Fox, which was originally sung by Jack Jones and, later, by Dionne Warwick.

Williams has had a variety of high-profile acting roles, such as Little Enos Burdette in the action-comedy &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot; (1977) and the villainous Swan in Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;Phantom of the Paradise&quot; (1974), which Williams also co-scored, receiving an Oscar nomination in the process. Since 2009, Williams has been the president and chairman of the American songwriting society ASCAP.

==Early life==
Williams was born in Omaha, Nebraska, the son of Paul Hamilton Williams, an architectural engineer, and his wife, Bertha Mae (née Burnside), a homemaker.

One of his brothers was John J. Williams, a NASA rocket scientist, who participated in the Mercury and Apollo programs and was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal, their highest honor, in 1969. His other brother was Mentor Williams, also a songwriter, who wrote Dobie Gray&#x27;s 1973 hit &quot;Drift Away&quot;.

==Musical career==

Williams began his professional songwriting career with Biff Rose in Los Angeles. The two men first met while working together on a television comedy show. Together, they wrote the song &quot;Fill Your Heart&quot; which was recorded by Rose on his first album, &quot;The Thorn in Mrs. Rose&#x27;s Side&quot; (1968). Tiny Tim covered it as the B-side of his hit &quot;Tiptoe Through the Tulips&quot; (1968). David Bowie recorded a version of the song on his album &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; (1971). Rose and Williams wrote &quot;I&#x27;ll Walk Away&quot; (recorded by Rose on his third, eponymous album). Rose was instrumental in getting Williams his break with A&amp;M Records which resulted in Williams working with songwriter Roger Nichols. Williams and Nichols were responsible for a number of successful pop hits from the 1970s, including several hits for Three Dog Night (&quot;An Old Fashioned Love Song&quot;, &quot;The Family of Man&quot; and &quot;Out in the Country&quot;), Helen Reddy (&quot;You and Me Against the World&quot;), and the Carpenters, most notably &quot;Rainy Days and Mondays&quot;, &quot;I Won&#x27;t Last a Day Without You&quot;, and &quot;We&#x27;ve Only Just Begun&quot;, originally a song for a Crocker National Bank television commercial featuring newlyweds, and which has since become a cover-band standard and &quot;de rigueur&quot; for weddings throughout North America.

An early collaboration with Roger Nichols, &quot;Someday Man&quot;, was covered by the Monkees (a group for which he unsuccessfully auditioned).

A frequent co-writer of Williams&#x27; was musician Kenneth Ascher. Their songs together included &quot;Rainbow Connection&quot;, sung by Jim Henson (as Kermit the Frog) in &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot; (1979).

Williams worked on the music for a number of films, including writing and singing on &quot;Phantom of the Paradise&quot; (1974) in which he starred and earned an Oscar nomination for the music, and &quot;Bugsy Malone&quot; (1976). Williams wrote and sang the song &quot;Where Do I Go from Here&quot;, which was used in the end credits of the film &quot;Thunderbolt and Lightfoot&quot;. He contributed lyrics to the &quot;Cinderella Liberty&quot; song &quot;You&#x27;re So Nice to Be Around&quot; with music by John Williams, and it earned them an Oscar nomination. Along with Ascher and Rupert Holmes, he wrote the music and lyrics to &quot;A Star Is Born&quot; (also 1976), with Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson. The love ballad, &quot;Evergreen&quot;, (lyrics by Paul Williams, melody by Barbra Streisand) won the Academy Award for Best Original Song and a Grammy for Song of the Year. He has been nominated on other occasions for an Academy Award and several Golden Globe Awards.

In 1987 he wrote the songs performed by Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty in the film &quot;Ishtar&quot;.

He wrote the music for a musical production of &quot;Happy Days&quot; that debuted in 2007 and made a cameo appearance as an animated version of himself singing &quot;Breathe in the Sunshine&quot; in a 1998 episode of the animated series &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;. He wrote and sang &quot;What Would They Say&quot;, the theme song from the made-for-television film &quot;The Boy in the Plastic Bubble&quot; (1976).

Williams wrote music and lyrics of &quot;Silence is Our Song&quot; for Richard Barone&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Glow&quot; and collaborated with Scissor Sisters on their second album, &quot;Ta-Dah&quot;.

In March 2012, it was announced that Williams had &quot;written a couple of tunes&quot; on &quot;Random Access Memories&quot;, the album of French electronic duo Daft Punk. He co-wrote and sang vocals on &quot;Touch&quot; and co-wrote &quot;Beyond&quot;. Williams and Nile Rodgers were the only featured artists to speak on behalf of Daft Punk at the 2014 Grammy Awards upon their receipt of the Album of the Year award for &quot;Random Access Memories&quot;. Williams told an anecdote about his work with Daft Punk: &quot;Back when I was drinking, I would imagine things that weren&#x27;t there and I&#x27;d get frightened. Then I got sober and two robots called and asked me to make an album.&quot; He communicated a &quot;message from the robots&quot; to the audience: &quot;As elegant and as classy as the Grammy has ever been is the moment when we saw those wonderful marriages and &#x27;Same Love&#x27; is fantastic. It is the height of fairness and love and the power of love for all people at any time in any combination is what [Daft Punk] wanted me to say. Captain Kirk uses the Enterprise. [Daft Punk] sail on a ship called Generosity. They are generous in spirit ... This is a labor of love and we are all so grateful.&quot;

Williams is a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and his songs have been performed by both pop and country music artists. In April 2009, Williams was elected president and chairman of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP).

In September 2015, Williams, along with bass player Kasim Sulton, led a global virtual songwriting collaboration at Hookist.com. The mission was to write the first crowd-sourced anthem to be performed at FacingAddiction.org&#x27;s concert and rally on The National Mall on October 4, 2015, headlined by Steven Tyler, Sheryl Crow and Joe Walsh among others. The theme of the song was &quot;Celebrate Recovery&quot; and the goal was to reduce the stigma associated with addiction. Williams, Sulton and Dr. Mehmet Oz opened the show and led 10,000 people in a singalong of &quot;Voice of Change&quot; at the base of the Washington Monument. Sulton led a singalong of the song on &quot;The Dr. Oz Show&quot; which went viral.

==Film and television career==
Although predominantly known for his music, Williams has appeared in films and many television guest spots, such as the Faustian record producer Swan in Brian DePalma&#x27;s film &quot;Phantom of the Paradise&quot; (1974)—a rock and roll adaptation of &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, &quot;Faust&quot;, and &quot;The Picture of Dorian Gray&quot;, for which Williams wrote the songs—and as Virgil, the genius orangutan in &quot;Battle for the Planet of the Apes&quot; (1973).

On February 9, 1973, Williams made a joke appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; in which he sang a song in full make-up as Virgil.

He made his film debut as Gunther Fry in the satire &quot;The Loved One&quot; (1965).

After appearing on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; in 1976, Williams worked closely with Jim Henson&#x27;s Henson Productions on &quot;The Muppet Movie&quot;, working on the soundtrack and appearing in a cameo part as the piano player in the nightclub where Kermit meets Fozzie Bear. He was also the lyricist for &quot;Emmet Otter&#x27;s Jug-Band Christmas&quot;.

Williams was hired by TV producers Paul Junger Witt and Tony Thomas to write title tracks for two of their ABC comedies, &quot;It Takes Two&quot; (1982–1983), on which he sang a duet with Crystal Gayle, and &quot;Condo&quot; (1983), in which Williams&#x27; theme was sung by Drake Frye. Williams composed and performed the theme to the McLean Stevenson sitcom &quot;The McLean Stevenson Show&quot; in 1976.

Williams composed, and sang &quot;Flying Dreams&quot; for the animated film &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot;.

Williams has appeared in many minor roles. He provided the voice of the Penguin in &quot;&quot;.

He appeared in 2008 in an episode of Nickelodeon&#x27;s children&#x27;s show &quot;Yo Gabba Gabba!&quot; entitled &quot;Weather&quot;, where he performed &quot;Rainbow Connection&quot;. He has also appeared on Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; where he played Professor Williams in an episode entitled &quot;Just An Old Fashioned Lab Song&quot;.

He made numerous television appearances in the 1970s and 1980s, including on &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;Match Game &#x27;79&quot;, &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Police Woman&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;The Hardy Boys&quot;, &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;, &quot;The Flip Wilson Special&quot;, &quot;Gimme a Break!&quot;, and &quot;The Gong Show&quot;. He has also guest-starred in the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; episode &quot;Acts of Sacrifice&quot; (Season 2 Episode 12) as Taq, the aide to Correlilmurzon, an alien ambassador whose species finalizes treaties and agreements by having sex with the other signees.

In October 1980, Williams was host of the &quot;Mickey Mouse Club 25th Anniversary Special&quot; on NBC-TV. He stated that he tried out for the show in early 1955 and was turned down. He was a frequent guest and performer on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. He appears as the man making the phone call at the beginning of the music video for Hank Williams Jr.&#x27;s song &quot;All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight&quot;. In 2014, he appeared on &quot;Community&quot; as an illegal textbook dealer who declines to purchase a batch of misprinted chemistry textbooks.

<text>The Samoyedic () or Samoyed languages () are spoken around the Ural Mountains, in northernmost Eurasia, by approximately 25,000 people altogether, accordingly called the Samoyedic peoples. They derive from a common ancestral language called Proto-Samoyedic, and form a branch of the Uralic languages. Having separated perhaps in the last centuries BC, they are not a diverse group of languages, and are traditionally considered to be an outgroup, branching off first from the other Uralic languages.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;Samoyedic&quot; is derived from the Russian term &quot;samoyed&quot; () originally applied only to the Nenets people and later extended to other related peoples. 

One of the theories supposes that the term is interpreted by some ethnologists as originating somewhat derogatorily from Russian &quot;samo-yed&quot;, literally meaning &quot;self-eater&quot; (the word has been interpreted by foreign travelers as an allegation of cannibalism).

Another suggestion for the term&#x27;s origin is a corruption of the expression &quot;saam-edne&quot;, meaning &quot;Land of the Saams&quot;.

The word &quot;Samodeic&quot; has been proposed as an alternative by some ethnologists.

In modern Russian the words самодийцы/самодийские (&quot;samodiytsy/samodiyskie&quot;), i.e., &quot;samodians&quot;/&quot;samodian&quot; are used for this ethnic grouping and the corresponding area of research is called , i.e., &quot;samodistics&quot;.

The word &quot;&quot; also refers in Russian to an excessively introspective or self-disparaging person i.e., the one engaged in /&quot;self-devouring&quot;.

==Classification==
Traditionally, Samoyedic languages and peoples have been divided into two major areal groups: Northern Samoyedic (Nenets, Yurats, Enets, Nganasans), and Southern Samoyedic (Selkups) with a further now-extinct subgroup of Sayan-Samoyedics (Kamasins, Mators) named after the Sayan Mountains. They are however purely geographical, and do not reflect linguistic relations.

Linguistic genealogical classifications point to an early divergence of Nganasan and (perhaps to a lesser degree) Mator, with Enets–Nenets–Yurats and Kamas–Selkup forming internal branches.
* Samoyedic
** Nganasan (&quot;Tavgi&quot; or &quot;Tawgi-Samoyed&quot;)
*** Avam
*** Vadey/Vadeyev
** Core-Samoyedic
*** Enets-Nenets
**** Enets (&quot;Yenisei-Samoyed&quot;)
***** Tundra Enets
***** Forest Enets
**** Yurats 
**** Nenets (&quot;Yurak-Samoyed&quot;)
***** Tundra Nenets
***** Forest Nenets
*** Kamas-Selkup
**** Selkup &quot;(Ostyak-Samoyed&quot;)
***** Northern Selkup (Taz)
***** Central Selkup (Tym)
***** Southern Selkup (Ket)
**** Kamassian (&quot;Sayan-Samoyed&quot;) 
***** Kamas
***** Koibal
** Mator (&quot;Sayan-Samoyed&quot;) 
*** Mator
*** Taigi
*** Karagas
*** Soyot (Modern Soyots were subject to Turkification and do not speak the historical language)
== Grammar ==
Samoyedic languages are primarily agglutinative. They have postpositions and suffixes and do not use articles or prefixes. Samoyedic languages also have grammatical evidentiality. Word order in Samoyedic languages is typically subject-object-verb (SOV). Below are two sentences in Nenets that demonstrate SOV word order and case in Samoyedic languages:

=== Nouns ===
Nouns in Samoyedic languages do not have gender, but they are declined for number (singular, dual, and plural) as well as case. All Samoyedic languages have at least seven noun cases which may include nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, ablative, locative, instrumental, lative, and/or prolative depending on the language.

=== Verbs ===
Many Samoyedic languages have the following three conjugation types: subjective, objective (in which the number of the object is expressed in addition to that of the subject), and reflexive. Verbs in Samoyedic languages have several moods, ranging from at least eight in Selkup to at least sixteen in Nenets. Other forms of verbs that can be found in Samoyedic languages are gerunds, participles, and infinitives. Of the Samoyedic languages, only Selkup has verbal aspect.

== Phonology ==
Sonorant-obstruent consonant clusters with two consonants, of which the latter consonant is more sonorous than the former, are the most frequently occurring consonant clusters in several Samoyedic languages. Conversely, consonant clusters ending in glides are not found in any Samoyedic languages.

Unlike some other Uralic languages, Samoyedic languages do not have vowel harmony.

Vowel epenthesis is frequently used in Samoyedic languages to break up consonant clusters, particularly in the case of loanwords borrowed from Russian.

Vowel epenthesis from Russian to Nenets
* крупа (krupa) &gt; xurupa &quot;cereals&quot;
* класс (klass) &gt; xalas &quot;class&quot;
Vowel epenthesis from Russian to Nganasan
* бригада (brigada) &gt; birigadә &quot;brigade&quot;
* метр (metr) &gt; metәrә &quot;meter&quot;
Vowel epenthesis from Russian to Selkup
* стекло (stʲeklo) &gt; tʲekɨla &quot;glass&quot;
* стол (stol) &gt; istol &quot;table&quot;

== Contact with Russian language ==

Samoyedic languages have experienced significant language contact with Russian to such an extent that members of the Nenets, Selkup, Nganasan, and Enets ethnic groups now often have Russian as a first language, with speakers of Samoyedic languages primarily belonging to elder age groups.

Russian loanwords in Samoyedic languages include: колхоз (&quot;collective farm&quot;), машина (&quot;car&quot;), молоко (&quot;milk&quot;), Москва (&quot;Moscow&quot;).

== Geographical distribution ==
At present, Samoyed territory extends from the White Sea to the Laptev Sea, along the Arctic shores of European Russia, including southern Novaya Zemlya, the Yamal Peninsula, the mouths of the Ob and the Yenisei, and into the Taimyr peninsula in northernmost Siberia. They are contiguous with the trans-Ural Ugric speakers and the cis-Ural Komi to the south, but they are cut off from the Baltic Finns by the Russians in the west. To the east traditionally dwell the northern Turkic Sakha. A substantial Samoyed city grew up at Mangazeya in the 16th century as a trade city, but was destroyed at the beginning of the 17th century.

The Southern Samoyedic languages, of which only the Selkup language has survived to the present day, historically ranged across a wide territory in central Siberia, extending from the basin of the Ob River in the west to the Sayan-Baikal uplands in the east. Records up to the 18th century sporadically report several further entities such as &quot;Abakan&quot;, &quot;Kagmasin&quot;, &quot;Soyot&quot;, though there is no clear evidence for any of these constituting separate languages, and all available data appears to be explainable as these having been simply early forms of Kamassian or Mator.

<doc id="371870" wikidata="Q4873450" url="?curid=371870" title="Bauer &amp; Cie. v. O'Donnell">
<text>Bauer &amp; Cie. v. O&#x27;Donnell, 229 U.S. 1 (1913), was a 1913 United States Supreme Court decision involving whether a purchaser of a patented product bearing a price-fixing notice incurs guilt of patent infringement by reselling the product at a price lower than that which the notice commands. A divided Court (5–4) held that it was not.

Bauer &amp; Cie, a German company, was the assignee of U.S. Patent No. 601,995, covering Sanatogen, a water-soluble drug product (patent medicine), advertised as the &quot;King of Tonics&quot; and a strength-giving &quot;concentrated scientific food.&quot; Bauer sold the patented product in the United States through its exclusive sales agent, Hehmeyer, under a license agreement. Sanatogen was sold with this notice on each bag:
O&#x27;Donnell, a retail druggist in Washington, DC, purchased Sanatogen at wholesale and resold the Sanatogen for less than $1. He persisted in doing this and was cut off, but he managed to continue to purchase the product from jobbers in DC &quot;and avers that he will continue such sales.&quot; This led to the present patent infringement suit. The Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia certified the case to the Supreme Court with this question:

==Ruling of Supreme Court==
Justice William R. Day delivered the majority opinion, joined by Justices White, Hughes, Lamar, Pitney. Justices McKenna, Holmes, Lurton, and Van Devanter dissented without opinion.

The Court restated the question before it as:
The patentee argued that the purpose of the restrictive notice was &quot;to prevent ruinous competition by the cutting of prices in sales of the patented article.&quot; Day responded, however, that absent a patent the Court had held resale price fixing unlawful in &quot;Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park &amp; Sons Co.&quot; And Congress could, if it had wanted to, have conferred on patentees the right to impose such restrictions. He then asked:

In the &quot;Bobbs-Merrill&quot; case the Court held that the copyright was exhausted by the first sale, and:

The Court recognized that &quot;there are differences between the copyright statute and the patent statute, and the purpose to decide the question now before us was expressly disclaimed&quot; in &quot;Bobbs–Merrill&quot;. Nonetheless, &quot;it is apparent that, in the respect involved in the present inquiry, there is a strong similarity between and identity of purpose in the two statutes.&quot; Both statutes grant an exclusive right to &quot;vend.&quot; There is no difference of importance in the respective legal rights to vend books and vend products:

The patentee here insists that the purpose of notices fixing resale prices, specifically &quot;keeping up prices and preventing competition&quot;—is more essential to the protection of patented goods than of copyrighted books. The Court expressed doubt that this was so, but in any case it was more likely that &quot;Congress had no intention to use the term &#x27;vend&#x27; in one sense in the patent act and . . . in another in the copyright law.&quot; Congress intended to provide &quot;[p}rotection in the exclusive right to sell . . . in both instances, and the terms used in the statutes are to all intents the same.&quot;
The only significant difference is that patent law gives an exclusive right to use and copyright law does not. The Supreme Court decision involving a post-sale restraint on which the patentee places chief reliance here is &quot;Henry v. A.B. Dick Co.&quot; But that decision was based on the exclusive &quot;use&quot; right:

Here, the patentee has argued &quot;that the notice in this case deals with the use of the invention, because the notice states that the package is licensed &#x27;for sale and use at a price not less than $1,&#x27; [and] that a purchase is an acceptance of the conditions. . .&quot; But, the Court insisted:

As in &quot;Bobbs-Merrill Co v. Straus&quot;, with copyright, the Court ruled, restrictions could not be extended beyond the terms of the statute, which grants an exclusive right to vend but grants no &quot;privilege to keep up prices and prevent competition by notices restricting the price at which the article may be resold.&quot; When the right to vend is exercised, patent rights are exhausted:

==Commentary==

● A contemporary Note in the &quot;Michigan Law Review&quot; said the case &quot;was of vital importance to a large number of manufacturers,&quot; as was &quot;evidenced by the various ingenious methods and devices which have since been adopted by numerous manufacturers to avoid the operation and application of the principles set forth in the decision,&quot; such as leasing and agency. The writer was surprised that &quot;The tendency of the Supreme Court seems to be to take the view that the monopoly enjoyed by the patentee was not meant by Congress to be without limitation, and consequently to make it practically impossible for the patentee to control the retail price.&quot;

The writer maintains: &quot;This decision by the Supreme Court was unquestionably a very great surprise to many, as it is not only directly in conflict with an almost unbroken line of decisions of the inferior federal courts,&quot; beginning with the &quot;Button-Fastener&quot; case, and &quot;it is also nearly impossible to reconcile this decision&quot; with &quot;Henry v. A. B. Dick Co.&quot; As for the &quot;Dick&quot; case, the writer continues, &quot;It was generally thought that in the &quot;Dick&quot; case the Supreme Court had expressly committed itself to the doctrine that the patentee could require the user to comply with any conditions which he might choose to impose.&quot; He considers the distinction drawn with that case to be flimsy and not &quot;clear, sound, or convincing.&quot;

● A contemporary Note in the &quot;California Law Review&quot; also observed that in light of the &quot;A.B. Dick&quot; decision it was natural &quot;that some slight surprise should be occasioned by the decision of the Supreme Court in the so-called Sanatogen case which holds that a patentee is without right to make or enforce a resale price stipulation.&quot; More accurately than the Michigan note, this note attributed the see-sawing in recent years to the changes in the personnel of a closely divided Court and successive replacements by new Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson appointees:

● Granville Munson, in a 1917 article on post-sale restraints, found the &quot;A.B. Dick&quot; and &quot;Bauer&quot; cases irreconcilable: &quot;It is submitted the &quot;Sanatogen&quot; case and the &quot;Dick&quot; case cannot both be upheld, although the court professes to distinguish the latter.&quot; He insisted that the exclusive right to &quot;vend&quot; must include the right to set terms and conditions on which the patented article will be vended, and not just the right to sell or not sell: &quot;If the word, &quot;vend,&quot; is to have any particular meaning in the patent law, it is submitted it must be taken to refer to the conditions which may be imposed on subsales.&quot; Munson therefore concludes that &quot;the decision in &quot;Bauer &amp; Cie v. O&#x27;Donnell&quot; should not be supported.&quot;

● Charles Miller was critical of the Court&#x27;s decision to suppress Bauer&#x27;s resale price fixing:

<text>Switzerland has long had a distinct cultural identity, despite its diversity of German, French, Italian, Romansh and other ethnicities. Religious and folk music dominated the country until the 17th century, with growth in production of other kinds of music occurring slowly.

== Classical music ==

Switzerland has produced many esteemed classical composers over the centuries, such as Rennaissance composer Ludwig Senfl, Joachim Raff, Arthur Honegger (who has featured on the Swiss franc note), and Ernest Bloch.

==Folk music==
Due to a lack of detailed records, little is known about Swiss folk music prior to the 19th century. Some 16th-century lute tablatures have been reconstructed into authentic instrumental arrangements; however, the first major source of information comes from 19th-century collections of folk songs, and work done by musicologist Hanny Christen. One of the oldest varieties of folk music was the Swiss song Kühreihen, an agricultural Alpine song in the Lydian mode. Traditional instruments included alphorn, hammered dulcimer, fife, hurdy-gurdy, castanets, rebec, bagpipe, cittern and shawm.

At the beginning of the 19th century, Swiss folk music was largely performed by ensembles made of itinerant musicians and solo acts using an instrument, with only a few duos. In the 1830s, however, the Swiss military was reorganized, leading to the formation of brass bands that used modern instruments. These instruments, mostly brass or wind, were built much better than those played by itinerants, and musicians brought them back to their villages. Local players joined these ensembles, which played dance music for festivals and other celebrations. Dance styles included schottisch, mazurka, waltz and polka.

In 1829, the accordion was invented in Vienna, and it had spread to Switzerland by 1836. The accordion was popular because it was relatively easy to play and cheap to acquire, and took only one musician to play the melody and accompaniment. By the 1850s, the accordion was an integral part of Swiss folk music, and semi-professional ensembles were appearing to play at large social dances. Alongside the brass bands came string instruments like the violin and double bass; string bands soon began to displace the older brass bands. The accordion, however, did not make an appearance in these dance bands until about 1903, and it eventually replaced the two violins which had become standard.

Following World War I, Switzerland became more heavily urbanized, and music moved to cities like Zürich. Rural folk music became the most popular style for middle-class audiences, and musicians like Joseph Stocker (&quot;Stocker Sepp&quot;) became renowned across the country. Stocker knew his audience liked the exotic appeal of rural music, and so he bought traditional costumes from Unterwalden for his band. This was the beginning of &quot;laendlermusic&quot;, which peaked in popularity in the 1930s and 1940s.

In the urban areas of Switzerland, folk music began to mix with new styles, like jazz and the foxtrot, while the saxophone replaced the clarinet. Beginning in the 1930s, the Swiss government began to encourage a national identity distinct from Germany and other neighbors. Laendlermusic became associated with this identity and grew even more popular.

Following World War II, however, laendlermusic quickly grew less popular with the influx of imported styles. The field also grew less diverse, with more standardized band formats and only four or five dance types in the repertoire. By the 1960s, trios consisting of two accordions and a double bass were the most common format, and many Swiss people felt it was a civic duty to preserve this tradition and guard it against change. They have largely succeeded in preventing change, but the field has grown stagnant and much less popular. There are still popular performers, such as Res Schmid, Willi Valotti, Markus Flueckiger, Dani Haeusler, and Carlo Brunner, but the total fanbase has shrunk enormously.

During the late 1990s, and especially in the 2000s from around 2008 to the present, the family band Oesch&#x27;s die Dritten, a yodeling family from the Bernese Oberland, have been enjoying success. Their format is a Schwyzerörgeli (small accordion) played by Hans Oesch, a guitar, an electric bass, and a large accordion. They are fronted by Melanie Oesch.

===Folk music from Appenzell===
The rural Appenzell region is a major center of folk music. While other parts of Switzerland adopted the accordion (Langnauerli and Schwyzerörgeli) in the 19th century, Appenzell kept the violin and hammered dulcimer. String music from Appenzell is popular throughout Switzerland. In its original arrangement (two violins, dulcimer, cello, contrabass) is of great importance, while the accordion and piano are also included in some formations.

==Pop and rock==
===Late 20th century===
Later in the 20th century, in the 1960s, rock and roll, or &quot;beat music&quot;, was popular, peaking in 1968 with the release of Les Sauterelles&#x27; &quot;Heavenly Club&quot;. Swiss rock popularity began in 1957, when the Hula Hawaiians incorporated rockabilly, setting the stage for the early 1960s boom. The Francophone section of Switzerland soon found itself dominated by French stars like Johnny Hallyday, and soon Swiss artists like Les Aiglons, Larry Greco and Les Faux-Frères became major artists.

1964 saw Beatles-inspired pop take hold on the continent, displacing the earlier instrumental rock and inspired musical battles in Basel, the capital of Swiss rock. Swiss bands in the same mold included The 16 Strings and Pichi, and German-speaking acts soon dominated the field. Zürich then became a center of innovation, drawing on Chris Lange&#x27;s blues-roots explorations, Heiner Hepp&#x27;s Bob Dylan-inspired folk and Toni Vescoli&#x27;s pop fame. Other Swiss artists of the period included R&amp;B act The Nightbirds from Locarno, light rock stars The Wild Gentlemen, The Blue Sounds and pop band Marco Zappa &amp; the Teenagers. In 1967, artists like Mani Matter, Franz Hohler, Sergius Golowin, and Kurt Marti began establishing Swiss-German dialect rock, glorifying their distinct national identities. While others like Roland Zoss and Tinu Heiniger sang on in German.

By 1968, Swiss rock was dying, and artists were exploring sonic innovations. Basel&#x27;s Barry Window, for example, used soul and Indian music to make rock, while The Sauterelles explored psychedelia.

Progressive music formed by the 1970s, when jazz, blues and other genres were combined with socially aware lyrics, outlandish solos and macho posturing. The first band of the progressive rock boom was supergroup Flame Dream, Krokodil, and The Shiver and Brainticket soon followed. Sinus Studio in Bern, and engineers Eric Merz and Peter McTaggart, became the center of innovation by the mid-1970s, however.

1973 saw the first commercial release of dialect rock with Rumpelstilz&#x27;s &quot;Warehuus Blues&quot;; the band broke into the mainstream in 1976 with the release of the reggae-influenced chart-topper &quot;Füüf Narre im Charre&quot;.

Later in the decade, hard rock became popular and Toad soon established a Swiss scene with the debut single, &quot;Stay!&quot;, setting the stage for the 1980 explosion of Krokus, the most popular rock band in Swiss music history. Also, bands like The Swiss Horns, Red Devil Band and Circus from Basel continued the music in a more experimental form and expanded the musical boundaries of Swiss punk rock. In 1976, a small group of Swiss punks began to adapt the American and British punk rock scene. Bands like Kleenex, Dieter Meier, The Nasal Boys, Troppo, Mother&#x27;s Ruin, TNT, Dogbodys, and Sick, all from Zürich, as well as Glueams (Bern), Sozz (Büren), Crazy (Lucerne), and Bastards and Jack &amp; the Rippers (Geneva) represented the Swiss punk &amp; wave scene of the late 1970s.

Kleenex – beside the British bands The Slits and The Raincoats – was one of the first three female bands of the Punk era, published in November 1978 their first single/EP with four songs. With the mixture of art-school, glamour and punk noise they attempted the attention of John Peel and became the first Swiss Wave export hit. They reached the UK-Charts and got a contract with Rough Trade Records.

During the 1980s, Switzerland produced a number of metal bands. A Swiss band, Celtic Frost, mostly known for their progression of style and avant-garde take on extreme music started in the early 1980s as Hellhammer and soon became a leading heavy metal band in Switzerland. They together with a few other bands laid the foundation of modern metal in Switzerland. Related to Celtic Frost is the technical thrash metal trio Coroner who were roadies for Celtic Frost. The late 1980s saw black metal band Samael being formed which converted into an industrial metal band.

At the beginning of the 1980s Swiss new wave bands developed their own individual music style and some of them became internationally famous, especially Kleenex/LiliPUT and Yello in UK and the US, or Grauzone and mittageisen in Germany. Grauzone reached the Austrian and German charts with their NDW-hit &quot;Eisbär&quot;. Mittageisen released in January 1985 the 12&quot; automaten&quot; with a new electro sound. The single found the way onto the legendary John Peel show on BBC Radio 1 and became an indie-disco hit. Other notable Swiss post-punk/new wave bands are Blue China, The Vyllies and The Young Gods. Formed in 1985 by vocalist Franz Treichler, the group used digital sampling to create an intense amalgamation of classical and rock music and became pioneers of industrial music. The English music-press react enthusiastically and Melody Maker made the band&#x27;s first self-titled album their &quot;The Album of the Year&quot;.

1983 saw the Ex-Trem Normal release &quot;Warum&quot; and &quot;Welcome to Switzerland&quot;, which revolutionized Bernese rock by adding distinctive dialect trends. They were followed by Züri West and other bands.

In 1986, the duo Double became the first Swiss act to hit the US Top 40 charts with their song, &quot;The Captain of Her Heart&quot;.

In 1981, the guitar instrumental group &quot;The four Windows&quot; with lead guitarist Wolfgang Oehry (Long tall Wolfie) won best of Swiss TV&#x27;s Sprungbrett, followed by a 5 year record contract with EMI. The group recorded the LP &quot;IDENTITY&quot;, from which EMI singled out Wolfgang&#x27;s composition &quot;Lonely Seagull&quot;. It became the summer hit of 1982 and received extensive airtime on many radio stations. The German music publication &quot;Fachblatt&quot; dedicated two pages to the Windows&#x27; album, praising it as the best guitar based album in years. The band played in many concert halls and open airs, once even in the Ice hockey stadion in Zürich. They also appeared in a number of TV shows. 

Since the 1980s Swiss jazz has continued to form. Notable exponents of the Swiss jazz scene are saxophonist Fritz Renold or trumpeter Franco Ambrosetti. Stephan Eicher is a popular folk rock musician, rising to prominence in the mid-1980s and gaining a popular following across Europe in the 1990s.

In the 1990s, many rappers and DJs started to influence Switzerland&#x27;s musical scene. Such as Black Tiger from Basel was the first one to rap in a Swiss German dialect. Sens Unik from Renens (a suburb of Lausanne) are one of the most important rap groups, merging hip hop with influences from many other styles. Even their first EP included a track in Spanish, due to MC Carlos&#x27;s Spanish and Galego heritage. Electronica is also part of the Swiss musical experience, Yello&#x27;s first album came out in 1979, in the 1980s, Touch El Arab scored a hit in several European countries with the song &quot;Muhammar&quot;. Producer Pat Jabbar from Basel established his own record company Barraka el Farnatshi in the late eighties, dedicated to music from the Arabic world (especially Morocco) mixed with dance music from the west. While most musicians&#x27; works were based on contemporary Anglo-Saxon music, singer-songwriter Christine Lauterburg took up the traditional Swiss folk music and merged old domestic song with pop and electronic music elements. With her version of the classic Swiss song &quot;S&#x27;Vreneli vom Guggisberg&quot;, she triggered intense indignation as well as praise.

One of the most popular Swiss singer and performance artists is DJ Bobo (born René Baumann).

Emerging in the early 1990s, the band Gotthard evolved to become the leading Swiss rock group and one of the most acclaimed bands in Europe. With a total of 8 studio albums, 2 compilation albums and 2 live albums (one of which unplugged), they changed their style from hard rock to adult contemporary rock. They are presently very popular in Switzerland, but also in Germany, Austria, Italy and Brazil. Singer Steve Lee was killed in a motorcycle accident on October 5, 2010. Nic Maeder joined the band and in 2012, they toured around the world with their new album &quot;Firebirth.&quot;

===21st century===
Some Swiss musicians actually enjoy a worldwide reputation, with commercial success. Helvetic electronic music plays a great role (house and dance music particularly), because of some artists like DJ Antoine, Remady, Yves Larock, or Mike Candys. Some popular Swiss acts today are the Neue Deutsche Härte band Metallspürhunde, The Dandies, Paysage d&#x27;Hiver, rock band 7 Dollar Taxi with Ralph Zöllig who plays the keyboard, Man-L and the Celtic metal band Eluveitie. Thomas Gabriel Fischer recently split up Celtic Frost and formed a new group, Triptykon, playing a black/doom style similar to recent Celtic Frost material.

In 2010, Swiss mathcore band Knut released their 4th full-length album, Wonder, on Hydra Head Records.

<doc id="371878" wikidata="Q953304" url="?curid=371878" title="Paul Williams (The Temptations singer)">
<text>Paul Williams (July 2, 1939 – August 17, 1973) was an American baritone singer. He was noted for being one of the founding members and the original lead singer of the Motown group the Temptations. Along with Elbridge &quot;Al&quot; Bryant, Otis Williams, and fellow Alabamians Eddie Kendricks and Melvin Franklin, Williams was a member of the Temptations. 

Personal problems and failing health forced Williams to retire in 1971 and, at the age of 34, he was found dead two years later as the result of an apparent suicide.

==Early years==
Paul Williams was born and raised in the Ensley neighborhood of Birmingham, Alabama. He was the son of Sophia and Rufus Williams, a gospel singer in a gospel music vocal group called the Ensley Jubilee Singers. He met Eddie Kendricks in elementary school; supposedly, the two first encountered each other in a fistfight after Williams dumped a bucket of mop water on Kendricks. Both boys shared a love of singing, and sang in their church choir together. As teenagers, Williams, Kendricks, and Kell Osborne and Willie Waller performed in a secular singing group known as The Cavaliers, with dreams of making it big in the music industry. In 1957, Williams, Kendricks, and Osborne left Birmingham to start careers, leaving Waller behind. Now known as the Primes, the trio moved to Cleveland, Ohio, and eventually found a manager in Milton Jenkins, who moved the group to Detroit, Michigan. Although the Primes never recorded, they were successful performers, and even launched a spin-off female group called the Primettes, who later became the Supremes.

In 1960, Kell Osborne moved to California, and the Primes disbanded. Kendricks returned to Alabama, but visited Paul in Detroit shortly after. While on this visit, he and Paul had learned that Otis Williams, head of a rival Detroit act known as the Distants, had two openings in his group&#x27;s lineup. Paul Williams and Kendricks joined Otis Williams, Melvin Franklin, and Elbridge Bryant to form the Elgins, who signed to the local Motown label in 1961, after first changing their name to the Temptations.

==Career==
===The Temptations===

Although the group now had a record deal, Paul Williams and his bandmates endured a long series of failed singles before finally hitting the Billboard Top 20 in 1964 with &quot;The Way You Do the Things You Do&quot;. More hits quickly followed, including &quot;My Girl&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Too Proud To Beg&quot; and &quot;(I Know) I&#x27;m Losing You&quot;.

Although Williams had been the group&#x27;s original lead singer during its formative years, by 1965, his role had been eclipsed by David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks, who had both sung lead on Temptations hit singles. As such, Williams was often overlooked for leads, even on album tracks and B-sides, prompting him to complain, &quot;Shit, I can sing too!&quot; In response, he was given lead vocals on the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; (1965).

Williams sang lead on several of the group&#x27;s songs, and served as the main lead singer during the group&#x27;s early years. His early leads include, &quot;Your Wonderful Love&quot; (1961), &quot;Slow Down Heart&quot; (1962), &quot;I Want a Love I Can See&quot; (1963), and &quot;Oh, Mother of Mine&quot; (1961) (the group&#x27;s first single) and &quot;Farewell My Love&quot; (1963) both shared with Eddie Kendricks. Considered the Temptations&#x27; best dancer, Williams served as the group&#x27;s original choreographer, devising routines for his group and the Supremes (most notably their trademark &quot;Stop! In the Name of Love&quot; routine), before Cholly Atkins took over that role for all of Motown&#x27;s acts. Williams&#x27; later leads on Temptations songs include &quot;Just Another Lonely Night&quot; (1965), &quot;No More Water in the Well&quot; (1967), and a cover version of &quot;Hey Girl&quot; (originally by Freddie Scott) released in 1969.

Williams also sang lead with Dennis Edwards, who joined in 1968, on Motown&#x27;s first Grammy Award winner, &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;. One of his best-known lead performances is his standout live performance of &quot;For Once in My Life&quot;, from the television special &quot;TCB&quot;, originally broadcast on December 9, 1968, on NBC. The live version of the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; is also frequently cited as one of his standout performances. He also took over the lead vocal for live performances of &quot;My Girl&quot; following David Ruffin&#x27;s departure from the group.

===Personal problems and decline===
Williams suffered from sickle-cell anemia, which frequently brought havoc on his physical health. In 1965, Williams began an affair with Winnie Brown, hair stylist for the Supremes and a relative of Supremes member Florence Ballard. In love with Brown but still devoted to his wife and children, Williams was also depressed because Cholly Atkins&#x27; presence now made Williams&#x27; former role as choreographer essentially, but not completely, obsolete. Life on the road led to Williams developing alcoholism, which was in strong contrast to drinking nothing stronger than milk. Otis Williams recounted, &quot;So to see a guy come from drinking milk to drinking, sometimes, two to three fifths of Courvoisier a day—that was kind of hard to take.&quot;

In the spring of 1969, Williams and Brown opened the Celebrity House West, a celebrity fashion boutique, in downtown Detroit. The business was not as successful as planned, and Williams soon found himself owing more than $80,000 in taxes (US$ in dollars). His health had deteriorated to the point that he would sometimes be unable to perform, suffering from combinations of exhaustion and pain which he combated with heavy drinking. Each of the other four Temptations did what they could to help Williams, alternating between raiding and draining his alcohol stashes, personal interventions, and keeping oxygen tanks backstage. Ultimately, Williams&#x27; health, as well as the quality of his performances, continued to decline and he refused to see a doctor.

Because Williams&#x27;s voice had become ravaged due to his respiratory illness and alcoholism, the Temptations decided to resort to enlisting an on-hand fill-in for him. Richard Street, then-lead singer of fellow Motown act the Monitors and formerly lead singer of the Distants, was hired to travel with the Temptations and sing all of Williams&#x27; parts, save for Williams&#x27; special numbers such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; and &quot;For Once in My Life&quot;, from backstage behind a curtain. When Williams was not well enough to go on, Street took his place onstage. In April 1971, Williams was finally persuaded to go see a doctor. The doctor found a spot on Williams&#x27; liver and advised him to retire from the group altogether. Williams left the group and Street became his permanent replacement. In support of helping Williams get back on his feet, he was paid his one-fifth share of the group&#x27;s royalties, and kept on the payroll as an advisor and choreographer for the next two years.

===Attempted solo career===
By early 1973, Williams began recording solo material for Motown. Kendricks, who had quit the Temptations just before Williams left, produced and co-wrote Williams&#x27; first single, &quot;Feel Like Givin&#x27; Up&quot;, with &quot;Once You Had a Heart&quot; as its b-side. However, by the following summer, Motown declined to release the single.

==Death==
On August 17, 1973, Williams was found dead inside a car parked in an alley having just left the new house of his then-girlfriend after an argument. A gun was found near his body. His death was ruled an apparent suicide. According to Otis Williams, Paul had expressed suicidal thoughts to him and Melvin Franklin months before his death.

Williams&#x27;s funeral was held on August 24, 1973, with his family and former bandmates in attendance. He was survived by his wife, Mary Agnes Williams, and five children: Sarita, Kenneth, Paula, Mary and Paul Jr. Paul Jr later joined a Temptations splinter group, the Temptations Review featuring Dennis Edwards. Williams also had three other children, Paul Williams Lucas, Anthony Johnson, and Derrick Vinyard, with three girlfriends. Williams is buried at Lincoln Memorial Park Cemetery, Clinton Township, Macomb County, Michigan in Lot 275, Grave #4, Section #G.

The circumstances surrounding Williams&#x27;s death caused the Williams family to suspect that some form of foul play was the actual cause of Williams&#x27;s death. According to the coroner, Williams had used his right hand to shoot himself on the left side of his head. In addition, a bottle of alcohol was found near Williams&#x27;s left side, as if he had dropped it while being shot. The gun used in the shooting was found to have fired two shots, only one of which had killed Williams.

==Legacy==
As a member of the Temptations, Paul Williams was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1999, and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in 2013. Both of his solo recordings were later released by Motown on Temptations-related compilations in the 1980s and 1990s.

In 1998, NBC aired &quot;The Temptations&quot;, a four-hour television miniseries based upon an autobiographical book by Otis Williams. Paul Williams was portrayed by actor Christian Payton.

The music video for the Diana Ross song &quot;Missing You&quot; pays tribute to Marvin Gaye, Florence Ballard, Tammi Terrell, and Paul Williams, all former Motown artists who had died.

<text>Hetty Wainthropp Investigates is a British crime drama television series, starring Patricia Routledge as the title character, Henrietta &quot;Hetty&quot; Wainthropp, that aired for four series between 3 January 1996 and 4 September 1998 on BBC One. The series, spawned from a pilot episode entitled &quot;Missing Persons&quot; aired by ITV in 1990, was co-created by writers David Cook and John Bowen, co-starred Derek Benfield as Hetty&#x27;s patient husband Robert, and Dominic Monaghan as her assistant and lodger Geoffrey Shawcross. It marked Monaghan’s acting debut.

Other co-stars in the series include John Graham Davies as local chief of police DCI Adams; Suzanne Maddock as Janet Frazer, a feisty young auto mechanic; and Frank Mills as Robert&#x27;s brother Frank. In the United States, episodes have broadcast as part of PBS&#x27;s anthology series &quot;Mystery!&quot;. A parody of the series, entitled &quot;Wetty Hainthropp Investigates&quot;, aired on 12 March 1999 as part of the Comic Relief telethon starring Victoria Wood, Julie Walters and Duncan Preston.

==Production==
&quot;Hetty Wainthropp Investigates&quot; is based on characters from the novel &quot;Missing Persons&quot; (1986) by David Cook, who co-wrote the episodes with John Bowen. The incidents in Cook&#x27;s novel were inspired by his own mother&#x27;s experiences. Prior to the pilot going into production, Patricia Routledge read the story &quot;Missing Persons&quot; for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;A Book At Bedtime&quot; in February 1987.

In 1990 ITV broadcast a feature-length pilot, &quot;Missing Persons&quot;, featuring Tony Melody as Robert Wainthropp and Garry Halliday as Geoffrey Shawcross, but ITV opted not to pursue a series. The storyline of this episode is ignored in the subsequent BBC series, with the first episode establishing Hetty as a detective in her first case and meeting Geoffrey for the first time. The characterization of Hetty was altered considerably for the series from the pilot. The &#x27;original&#x27; Hetty was blonde and far more &#x27;theatrical&#x27; in her manner. Additionally, the pilot character lived in considerably better circumstances than the home seen in the series.

The BBC series was filmed primarily in Burnley, Darwen, Blackburn, Rossendale, Bolton and other locations in Lancashire.

The music for the series was composed by Nigel Hess, the cornet solo was performed by Phillip McCann and in 1997 the title track was awarded the Ivor Novello Award for best television theme.

The BBC series was popular with viewers, but no further episodes were commissioned after 1998. In 2008 Patricia Routledge said in an interview that the cast and crew had been told by the BBC at the end of the fourth series that a fifth series would be commissioned, but it never was. In 2017 Suzanne Maddock shared her memories of making &quot;Hetty Wainthropp Investigates&quot; in a 45-minute interview for &quot;The Bill Podcast&quot; and explained how she felt disappointed for the fans of the series that they did not get to see a proper conclusion to the series.

==Synopsis== 
Hetty Wainthropp is a retired working-class woman from Darwen in northwest England, who has a knack for jumping to conclusions and solving crimes of varying bafflement which often are too minor to concern the police. Although on occasion her husband offers assistance, he more often than not tends to the home while Hetty gads about the countryside with young Geoffrey in search of resolution and justice. In many episodes Hetty seeks the help and advice of DCI Adams of the local constabulary. All four series are available to stream on ITVX Premium.

<text>The cylinder desk is a desk that resembles a Bureau Mazarin or a writing table equipped with small stacked shelves in front of the user&#x27;s main work surface, and a revolving cylinder part that comes down to hide and lock up the working papers when the desk is not in use. 

Like the rolltop desk, which was invented much later, the cylinder desk usually has a fixed work surface: the paperwork does not have to be stored before the desk is shut. Some designs, however, have the capacity to slide the desk surface out a few inches to expand the available work area.

The cylinder desk is also called &quot;bureau Kaunitz&quot;, as it was allegedly introduced in France in the first half of the 18th century by Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz, then the ambassador of the Habsburg Empire to the French court. Regardless of the authenticity of its origin, the French court adopted this type of desk with great enthusiasm. 

The difficulty of producing wooden cylinder sections which would not warp over the years ensured that such desks were reserved for the rich. A few variants of this form have slats instead of a one-piece cylinder section.

The most famous cylinder desk, and perhaps the most famous desk of all times, is the Bureau du Roi manufactured for the French royalty in the 18th century.

<text>Frank Malcolm Robinson (August 9, 1926 – June 30, 2014) was an American science fiction and techno-thriller writer. He was a speechwriter for gay politician Harvey Milk and Milk&#x27;s designated successor in the event of his death but declined to be appointed to or run for office.

==Biography==
Born in Chicago, Illinois. Robinson was the son of a check forger. He started out in his teens working as a copy boy for International News Service and then became an office boy for Ziff Davis. He was drafted into the Navy for World War II, and when his tour was over attended Beloit College, where he majored in physics, graduating in 1950. He could find no work as a writer, so he ended up back in the Navy and serving in Korea, where he kept writing and reading, as well as publishing in &quot;Astounding&quot; magazine.

After the Navy, he attended graduate school in journalism, then worked for a Chicago-based Sunday supplement. Soon he switched to &quot;Science Digest&quot;, where he worked from 1956 to 1959. From there, he moved into men&#x27;s magazines: &quot;Rogue&quot; (1959–65) and &quot;Cavalier&quot; (1965–66). In 1969, &quot;Playboy&quot; asked him to take over the &quot;Playboy Advisor&quot; column. He remained there, without revealing that he was gay, until 1973, when he left to write full-time.

After moving to San Francisco in the 1970s, Robinson was a speechwriter for gay politician Harvey Milk; he had a small role in the film &quot;Milk&quot;. After Milk&#x27;s assassination, Robinson was co-executor, with Scott Smith, of Milk&#x27;s last will and testament.

Robinson was the author of 16 books, the editor of two others, and penned numerous articles. Three of his novels have been made into films. &quot;The Power&quot; (1956) was a supernatural science fiction and government conspiracy novel about people with superhuman skills, filmed in 1968 as &quot;The Power&quot;. The technothriller &quot;The Glass Inferno&quot;, co-written with Thomas N. Scortia, was combined with Richard Martin Stern&#x27;s &quot;The Tower&quot; to produce the 1974 feature film &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;. &quot;The Gold Crew&quot;, also co-written with Scortia, was a nuclear threat thriller filmed as an NBC miniseries and re-titled &quot;The Fifth Missile&quot;.

He collaborated on several other works with Scortia, including &quot;The Prometheus Crisis&quot;, &quot;The Nightmare Factor&quot;, and &quot;Blow-Out&quot;. More recent works include &quot;The Dark Beyond the Stars&quot; (1991), and an updated version of &quot;The Power&quot; (2000), which closely followed &quot;Waiting&quot; (1999), a novel with similar themes to &quot;The Power&quot;. His novel is a medical thriller about organ theft called &quot;The Donor&quot;.

In the 1970s, Robinson started seriously collecting the vintage pulp-fiction magazines that he had grown up reading. The collection spawned a book on the history of the pulps as seen through their vivid cover art: &quot;Pulp Culture: The Art of Fiction Magazines&quot; (with co-author Lawrence Davidson). He attended numerous pulp conventions and in 2000 won the Lamont Award for lifetime achievement at Pulpcon.

In 2009 he was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame.

<text>&quot;Desiderata&quot;(Latin: &quot;things desired&quot;) is a 1927 prose poem by the American writer Max Ehrmann. The text was widely distributed in poster form in the 1960s and 1970s.

==History==
Max Ehrmann of Terre Haute, Indiana started writing the work in 1921, but he did not assign it a title. He registered for his U.S. copyright in 1927 using the poem&#x27;s first phrase as its title. The April 5, 1933 issue of &quot;Michigan Tradesman&quot; magazine published the full, original text on its cover, crediting Ehrmann as its author. In 1933, he distributed the poem in the form of a Christmas card, now officially titled &quot;Desiderata.&quot;

Psychiatrist Merrill Moore distributed more than 1,000 unattributed copies to his patients and soldiers during World War II. After Ehrmann died in 1945, his widow published the work in 1948 in &quot;The Poems of Max Ehrmann&quot;. The 1948 version was in the form of one long prose paragraph, so earlier and later versions were presumably also in that form.

The reverend Frederick Kates distributed about 200 unattributed copies as devotional materials for his congregation at Old Saint Paul&#x27;s Church, Baltimore during 1959 or 1960. The papers mentioned the church&#x27;s foundation date of 1692, which has caused many to falsely assume that the date is that of the poem&#x27;s origination.

The text was widely distributed in poster form in the 1960s and 1970s, often with the incorrect date of 1692. It was first partitioned into a few subparagraphs separated by &quot;distinctive spacing figures&quot; in 1970 by Pro Arts and Crescendo Publishers. Later, it was divided into four or more subparagraphs separated by new lines in DePauw University&#x27;s &quot;Mirage&quot; for 1978 and in the July/August 1999 issue of &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. In some versions, almost all instances of &quot;and&quot; are replaced by ampersands. Other versions change &quot;the noise and the haste&quot; to &quot;the noise and haste&quot; and change &quot;be cheerful&quot; to &quot;be careful,&quot; notably in the 1971 spoken-word recording by Les Crane.

==Copyright status==

Ehrmann&#x27;s widow renewed the copyright in 1954. In 1967, Robert L. Bell acquired the publishing rights from Bruce Humphries Publishing Company, and then bought the copyright from Richard Wright, nephew and heir to the Ehrmann work.

In August 1971, the poem was published in &quot;Success Unlimited&quot; magazine without permission from Bell. In a 1975 lawsuit against the magazine&#x27;s publisher Combined Registry Co., the court ruled that copyright had been forfeited because the poem had been authorized for publication without a copyright notice in 1933 and 1942, meaning that the poem was therefore in the public domain. The ruling was upheld by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals but was denied consideration by the Supreme Court. However, Bell refused to recognize the ruling. As the decision was only valid in the appeals court&#x27;s jurisdiction of Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin, Bell continued to litigate in other jurisdictions, seeking removal of the poem from offending publications or payment of royalties.

The poem is now officially in the public domain throughout the U.S., as written works registered before 1928 entered the public domain in 2023.

==Significant usages of the poem==
* A Spanish-language version by Mexican actor Arturo Benavides topped the Mexican charts for six weeks in 1972.
* In 1971, Les Crane used a spoken-word recording of the poem as the lead track of his album &quot;Desiderata&quot;. His producers had assumed that the poem was too old to be copyrighted, but the publicity surrounding the record led to clarification of Ehrmann&#x27;s authorship and the eventual payment of royalties. Crane&#x27;s version peaked at #4 in Australia and Canada in December 1971.
* In 2010, Ehrmann&#x27;s hometown of Terre Haute, Indiana unveiled a bronze statue by Bill Wolfe of Ehrmann sitting on a park bench.
* Following his government&#x27;s loss of majority in the 1972 Canadian federal election, prime minister Pierre Trudeau reassured the nation by quoting &quot;Desiderata:&quot; &quot;Whether or not it is clear to you, no doubt the universe is unfolding as it should.&quot;
* In a 1982 episode of &quot;The Professionals&quot; titled &quot;Discovered in a Graveyard&quot;, a framed copy is found in Ray Doyle&#x27;s apartment and is read aloud by George Cowley.
* In a 2012 interview on Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s Master Class television special, actor Morgan Freeman explained how deeply the poem had shaped his life.
* When former Illinois governor and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Adlai Stevenson died in 1965, a copy of the poem was found near his bedside, as he had planned to use it in his Christmas cards. This discovery contributed further to the poem&#x27;s popularity.

<doc id="371914" wikidata="Q2859794" url="?curid=371914" title="Real tree">
<text>In mathematics, real trees (also called formula_1-trees) are a class of metric spaces generalising simplicial trees. They arise naturally in many mathematical contexts, in particular geometric group theory and probability theory. They are also the simplest examples of Gromov hyperbolic spaces.

== Definition and examples ==

=== Formal definition ===

A metric space formula_2 is a real tree if it is a geodesic space where every triangle is a tripod. That is, for every three points formula_3 there exists a point formula_4 such that the geodesic segments formula_5 intersect in the segment formula_6 and also formula_7. This definition is equivalent to formula_2 being a &quot;zero-hyperbolic space&quot; in the sense of Gromov (all triangles are &quot;zero-thin&quot;). 
Real trees can also be characterised by a topological property. A metric space formula_2 is a real tree if for any pair of points formula_10 all topological embeddings formula_11 of the segment formula_12 into formula_2 such that formula_14 have the same image (which is then a geodesic segment from formula_15 to formula_16).

=== Simple examples ===

*If formula_2 is a connected graph with the combinatorial metric then it is a real tree if and only if it is a tree (i.e. it has no cycles). Such a tree is often called a simplicial tree. They are characterised by the following topological property: a real tree formula_18 is simplicial if and only if the set of singular points of formula_2 (points whose complement in formula_2 has three or more connected components) is closed and discrete in formula_2.
* The formula_1-tree obtained in the following way is nonsimplicial. Start with the interval [0, 2] and glue, for each positive integer &quot;n&quot;, an interval of length 1/&quot;n&quot; to the point 1 − 1/&quot;n&quot; in the original interval. The set of singular points is discrete, but fails to be closed since 1 is an ordinary point in this formula_1-tree. Gluing an interval to 1 would result in a closed set of singular points at the expense of discreteness.
* The Paris metric makes the plane into a real tree. It is defined as follows: one fixes an origin formula_24, and if two points are on the same ray from formula_24, their distance is defined as the Euclidean distance. Otherwise, their distance is defined to be the sum of the Euclidean distances of these two points to the origin formula_24.
* The plane under the Paris metric is an example of a hedgehog space, a collection of line segments joined at a common endpoint. Any such space is a real tree.

== Characterizations ==

Here are equivalent characterizations of real trees which can be used as definitions:

1) &quot;(similar to trees as graphs)&quot; A real tree is a geodesic metric space which contains no subset homeomorphic to a circle.

2) A real tree is a connected metric space formula_27 which has the four points condition (see figure): 
:For all formula_28 formula_29.

3) A real tree is a connected 0-hyperbolic metric space (see figure). Formally, 
:For all formula_28 formula_31
where formula_32 denotes the Gromov product of formula_15 and formula_16 with respect to formula_35, that is, formula_36

4) &quot;(similar to the characterization of plane trees by their contour process).&quot; Consider a positive excursion of a function. In other words, let formula_37 be a continuous real-valued function and formula_38 an interval such that formula_39 and formula_40 for formula_41.

For formula_42, formula_43, define a pseudometric and an equivalence relation with: 

:formula_44 

:formula_45 

Then, the quotient space formula_46 is a real tree. Intuitively, the local minima of the excursion &quot;e&quot; are the parents of the local maxima. Another visual way to construct the real tree from an excursion is to &quot;put glue&quot; under the curve of &quot;e&quot;, and &quot;bend&quot; this curve, identifying the glued points (see animation).

== Examples ==

Real trees often appear, in various situations, as limits of more classical metric spaces.

=== Brownian trees ===

A Brownian tree is a stochastic process whose value is a (non-simplicial) real tree almost surely. Brownian trees arise as limits of various random processes on finite trees.

=== Ultralimits of metric spaces ===

Any ultralimit of a sequence formula_47 of formula_48-hyperbolic spaces with formula_49 is a real tree. In particular, the asymptotic cone of any hyperbolic space is a real tree.

=== Limit of group actions ===

Let formula_50 be a group. For a sequence of based formula_50-spaces formula_52 there is a notion of convergence to a based formula_50-space formula_54 due to M. Bestvina and F. Paulin. When the spaces are hyperbolic and the actions are unbounded the limit (if it exists) is a real tree.

A simple example is obtained by taking formula_55 where formula_56 is a compact surface, and formula_57 the universal cover of formula_56 with the metric formula_59 (where formula_60 is a fixed hyperbolic metric on formula_56).

This is useful to produce actions of hyperbolic groups on real trees. Such actions are analyzed using the so-called Rips machine. A case of particular interest is the study of degeneration of groups acting properly discontinuously on a real hyperbolic space (this predates Rips&#x27;, Bestvina&#x27;s and Paulin&#x27;s work and is due to J. Morgan and P. Shalen).

=== Algebraic groups ===

If formula_62 is a field with an ultrametric valuation then the Bruhat–Tits building of formula_63 is a real tree. It is simplicial if and only if the valuations is discrete.

== Generalisations ==

=== formula_64-trees ===

If formula_64 is a totally ordered abelian group there is a natural notion of a distance with values in formula_64 (classical metric spaces correspond to formula_67). There is a notion of formula_64-tree which recovers simplicial trees when formula_69 and real trees when formula_67. The structure of finitely presented groups acting freely on formula_64-trees was described. In particular, such a group acts freely on some formula_72-tree.

=== Real buildings ===

The axioms for a building can be generalized to give a definition of a real building. These arise for example as asymptotic cones of higher-rank symmetric spaces or as Bruhat-Tits buildings of higher-rank groups over valued fields.

<doc id="371915" wikidata="Q27417" url="?curid=371915" title="Modern Talking">
<text>Modern Talking was a German pop duo consisting of arranger, songwriter and producer Dieter Bohlen and singer Thomas Anders. They have been referred to as Germany&#x27;s most successful pop duo, and have had a number of hit singles, reaching the top five in many countries. Their most popular singles are &quot;You&#x27;re My Heart, You&#x27;re My Soul&quot;, &quot;You Can Win If You Want&quot;, &quot;Cheri, Cheri Lady&quot;, &quot;Brother Louie&quot;, &quot;Atlantis Is Calling (S.O.S. for Love)&quot; and &quot;Geronimo&#x27;s Cadillac&quot;.

Modern Talking worked together from 1983 to 1987, when the band disbanded. They made a successful comeback, recording and releasing music from 1998 to 2003. The duo released singles (many of which involved American rapper Eric Singleton) which again entered the top ten in Germany and elsewhere, one of which was a re-recorded version of &quot;You&#x27;re My Heart, You&#x27;re My Soul&quot;, to whose title &quot;&#x27;98&quot; was added. By the duo&#x27;s final break-up in 2003, their combined global sales (singles and albums) had reached 120 million.

==History==
===1983–1987: Beginning===
First formed in West Berlin in early 1983, they unexpectedly became popular at the beginning of 1985 with &quot;You&#x27;re My Heart, You&#x27;re My Soul&quot;, with which they occupied top ten positions in 35 countries, including their homeland, where the single perched at the top of the charts for six consecutive weeks. The single would go on to sell eight million copies worldwide. It was followed by another chart-topping hit, &quot;You Can Win If You Want&quot;, which was released in the middle of 1985 off the debut album &quot;The 1st Album&quot;. The album was certified platinum in Germany for selling over 500,000 units.

Soon after their second hit, Modern Talking released the single &quot;Cheri, Cheri Lady&quot; which also quickly climbed to number one in West Germany, Finland, Greece, Spain, Switzerland, Austria and Norway, and made it into the top ten in Denmark, Belgium, Sweden and the Netherlands. As the sole track released from &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot;, it procured that second album&#x27;s platinum status in West Germany (for sales over 500,000). Success continued with two further number-one singles, &quot;Brother Louie&quot; and &quot;Atlantis Is Calling (S.O.S. for Love)&quot;, from the third album, &quot;Ready for Romance&quot;. The duo also charted high with their sixth single, &quot;Geronimo&#x27;s Cadillac&quot;, from the fourth album, &quot;In the Middle of Nowhere&quot;, and &quot;Jet Airliner&quot; from their fifth album, &quot;Romantic Warriors&quot;.

Due to the lacklustre reception accorded the sixth album, Bohlen announced the project&#x27;s termination in a German interview given while Anders was away in Los Angeles. The two had had a relationship that was quarrelsome, if not tumultuous, and this only worsened the animosity. Bohlen cited Anders&#x27; then wife Nora as the main reason for breaking up: she&#x27;d forbidden her husband from being interviewed by female reporters and repeatedly demanded major changes to shows, videos and recordings, a fact that Anders would admit to in his biography. After a last phone call, heavily laden with profanity and insults, they broke off all contact for over ten years.

During their early era, Modern Talking knew success in Europe, Asia, South America, the Middle East and Iran. In Britain, they only entered the chart with 4 songs, with &quot;Brother Louie&quot; being their highest at number 4. In 1985, RCA signed Modern Talking for a US deal and released their first album there, but they remained virtually unknown there, and certainly didn&#x27;t make the US charts.

They released two albums each year from 1985 to 1987, while also promoting their singles on television across Europe, eventually selling 65 million records in three years.

Notably, Modern Talking were one of the first Western bloc bands sale of whose records was allowed in the Soviet Union. After four decades of Cold War censorship and import restrictions, Chairman Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s glasnost reforms in the USSR in 1986 opened up the Soviet sphere to western bands, including Modern Talking at the height of their popularity. As a result, they nurtured a large, enduring fanbase in Eastern Europe.

===Between 1987 and 1997===
Immediately after the duo split in mid-1987, Bohlen formed his own project called Blue System and enjoyed several high chart positions, with tracks like &quot;Sorry Little Sarah&quot;, &quot;My Bed Is Too Big&quot;, &quot;Under My Skin&quot;, &quot;Love Suite&quot;, &quot;Laila&quot; and &quot;Déjà vu&quot;. Meanwhile, Anders went solo, touring under the name &quot;Modern Talking&quot; on several continents until the beginning of 1989, when he started to record some of his new pop-like material in Los Angeles and London, as well as Germany. Anders recorded five solo albums in English (&quot;Different&quot;, &quot;Whispers&quot;, &quot;Down on Sunset&quot;, &quot;When Will I See You Again&quot; and &quot;Souled&quot;) and one in Spanish - &quot;Barcos de Cristal&quot;. He was more successful elsewhere than at home, even if he did achieve several hits in Germany. Overcoming past differences, Bohlen and Anders embarked on more amenable relations when Anders moved back to Koblenz, Germany, in 1994.

===1998–2003: Reunion===
At the beginning of 1998, the duo got back together, performing in the March on the German TV show &quot;Wetten, dass..?&quot;. They released a remixed version of their 1984 single &quot;You&#x27;re My Heart, You&#x27;re My Soul&quot;, featuring Eric Singleton on rap vocals. Their first comeback album &quot;Back for Good&quot;, which included four new tracks, as well as all of the previous hits remixed with up-to-date techniques, took the number-one spot in 15 countries, occupying Germany&#x27;s for five consecutive weeks. It would sell three million copies in Europe alone. The duo won Best Selling German Band at the World Music Awards that year. The follow-up album, &quot;Alone&quot;, also went straight to number one in Germany, and was very successful elsewhere: over one million sales in Europe alone.

Bohlen and Anders followed their 1980s practice of choosing to release two singles from an album. A series of singles and four further albums followed: &quot;Year of the Dragon&quot;, &quot;America&quot;, &quot;Victory&quot; and &quot;Universe&quot;. In 2003, after chalking up over 400 gold and platinum awards worldwide, Bohlen and Anders disbanded again, just before releasing another best-of compilation. This second break-up was reportedly sparked by Bohlen&#x27;s negative portrayal of Anders in his autobiography, published 4 October 2003. The period of division between them was one in which Bohlen was involved with &quot;Deutschland sucht den Superstar&quot; (DSDS), the German edition of the UK&#x27;s TV talent show &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. 2003&#x27;s compilation, entitled &quot;The Final Album&quot;, contained all of the duo&#x27;s singles. Thomas Anders relaunched his solo career immediately after the end of Modern Talking, while Bohlen was devoting most of his time to new talent, especially those discovered on DSDS.

==Musical style and production==

In 1984, Bohlen cited the hit single &quot;Precious Little Diamond&quot; (by Fox the Fox) as his inspiration for using falsetto choruses. The studio vocal line-up of Rolf Köhler, Michael Scholz, Detlef Wiedeke and (on early albums) Birger Corleis, in addition to Bohlen and Anders, produced the high choruses characteristic of Modern Talking. Köhler, Scholz and Wiedeke later went on to work with Bohlen in Blue System, before joining with songwriter Thomas Widrat to form Systems in Blue. Köhler, Scholz and Wiedeke were never credited on the Modern Talking albums, and eventually went to court over the matter. They received an out of court settlement and Bohlen published a sleeve note for his next release (&quot;Obsession&quot;, by Blue System), acknowledging the trio&#x27;s contribution.

Further influences include German-language schlager music, disco-pop (the Bee Gees) and romantic English-language songs of Italian and French origin, like Gazebo&#x27;s &quot;I Like Chopin&quot;. After the 1998 reunion, Bohlen produced Eurodance as well as American-style MOR ballads.

Dieter Bohlen also composed for other artists while still in Modern Talking, such as for Chris Norman and Smokie, whose song &quot;Midnight Lady&quot; (1986) remains Bohlen&#x27;s most popular composition. He also composed a large number of tracks for C. C. Catch, using an accelerated, less-romantic sound. Some English Bohlen songs such as &quot;You&#x27;re My Heart, You&#x27;re My Soul&quot; were also recorded with German lyrics by Mary Roos, using the same playback tracks. When Modern Talking disbanded in 1987, a number of tracks written for the last album were re-arranged and then transferred onto Bohlen&#x27;s first solo album by Blue System. Modern Talking&#x27;s sixth album was released about the same time as the first single from Blue System, &quot;Sorry Little Sarah&quot;, where Bohlen competed on the charts against Modern Talking&#x27;s &quot;In 100 Years&quot; hit song.

Global sales of Modern Talking when the duo definitively broke up in 2003 stood at 120 million singles and albums combined, making them the biggest-selling German music act in history.

==Post years and legacy==
In 2006, Bohlen included a secret message in his song &quot;Bizarre Bizarre&quot;, which, when played backwards, is revealed as: &quot;There will never be an end to Modern Talking.&quot; To which was added: &quot;I meant to say that the music of Modern Talking will live forever.&quot; Anders has kept the Modern Talking songs in his repertoire and produced songs in a similar vein for his solo records (&quot;Independent Girl&quot;). In 2006, he produced an album &quot;Songs Forever&quot; of swing and jazz versions of popular songs (including Modern Talking&#x27;s first hit). Bohlen has written two autobiographical books about Modern Talking&#x27;s history from his perspective. The first book sold a million copies in Germany. The sequel was heavily criticised for his unfairness towards the people he worked with. As a result of that, Bohlen withdrew from the public for a year until 2006, when he said he regretted putting out the second book. Anders had not been the only one pressing charges against Bohlen and demanding that sections of the book be modified. Frank Farian was also angered by Bohlen&#x27;s literary output and released a book in which he tried to expose Bohlen as a fraud. Bohlen&#x27;s first book was the basis of an animated comedy film called &quot;&quot;. The contains a new Modern Talking song &quot;Shooting Star&quot; which had been created using fragments of vocal recordings from previous Modern Talking titles from the &quot;Year of the Dragon&quot; album.

Music critics were unenthusiastic about Modern Talking and gave the band&#x27;s music and performance lacklustre reviews. Although recognizing the catchiness and professional production of the songs, the lack of originality was criticized by British representatives of these genres of music, such as the Pet Shop Boys or Erasure. In particular, criticism was levelled at the &quot;sameness&quot; among many of their songs, something Bohlen himself conceded to &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; in 1989:

<doc id="371939" wikidata="Q781898" url="?curid=371939" title="Os Lusíadas">
<text>Os Lusíadas (), usually translated as The Lusiads, is a Portuguese epic poem written by Luís Vaz de Camões ( – 1580) and first published in 1572. It is widely regarded as the most important work of Portuguese-language literature and is frequently compared to Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; (1st c. BC). The work celebrates the discovery of a sea route to India by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama (1469–1524). The ten cantos of the poem are in ottava rima and total 1,102 stanzas.

Written in Homeric fashion, the poem focuses mainly on a fantastic interpretation of the Portuguese voyages of discovery during the 15th and 16th centuries. &quot;Os Lusíadas&quot; is often regarded as Portugal&#x27;s national epic, much as Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; was for the Ancient Romans, or Homer&#x27;s &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; for the Ancient Greeks. It was written when Camões was an exile in Macau and was first printed in 1572, three years after the author returned from the Indies.

==Internal structure==

The poem consists of ten cantos, each with a different number of stanzas (1102 in total). It is written in the decasyllabic &quot;ottava rima&quot;, which has the rhyme scheme ABABABCC, and contains a total of 8816 lines of verse.

The poem is made up of four sections:
*An introduction (&quot;proposition&quot; – presentation of the theme and heroes of the poem)
*&quot;Invocation&quot; – a prayer to the &quot;Tágides&quot;, the nymphs of the Tagus;
*A &quot;dedication&quot; – (to Sebastian of Portugal)
*Narration (the epic itself) – starting in stanza 19 of canto I, in medias res, opening in the midst of the action, with the background story being told later in the epic.

The narration concludes with an epilogue, starting in stanza 145 of canto X. The most important part of &quot;Os Lusíadas&quot;, the &quot;arrival in India&quot;, was placed at the point in the poem that divides the work according to the golden section at the beginning of Canto VII.

==Key concepts==

===The heroes===
The heroes of the epic are the Lusiads (&quot;Lusíadas&quot;), the sons of Lusus—in other words, the Portuguese. The initial strophes of Jupiter&#x27;s speech in the &quot;Concílio dos Deuses Olímpicos&quot; (Council of the Olympian Gods), which open the narrative part, highlight the laudatory orientation of the author.

In these strophes, Camões speaks of the first and second Viriathus and Quintus Sertorius, the people of Lusus, a people predestined by the Fates to accomplish great deeds. Jupiter says that their history proves it because, having emerged victorious against the Moors and Castilians, this tiny nation has gone on to discover new worlds and impose its law in the concert of the nations. At the end of the poem, on the Island of Love, the fictional finale to the glorious tour of Portuguese history, Camões writes that the fear once expressed by Bacchus has been confirmed: that the Portuguese would become gods.

The extraordinary Portuguese discoveries and the &quot;new kingdom that they exalted so much&quot; (&quot;novo reino que tanto sublimaram&quot;) in the East, and certainly the recent and extraordinary deeds of the &quot;strong Castro&quot; (&quot;Castro forte&quot;, the viceroy Dom João de Castro), who had died some years before the poet&#x27;s arrival in Indian lands, were the decisive factors in Camões&#x27; completion of the Portuguese epic. Camões dedicated his masterpiece to King Sebastian of Portugal.

===The narrators and their speeches===
The vast majority of the narration in &quot;Os Lusíadas&quot; consists of grandiloquent speeches by various orators: the main narrator; Vasco da Gama, recognized as &quot;eloquent captain&quot; (&quot;facundo capitão&quot;); Paulo da Gama; Thetis; and the Siren who tells the future in Canto X. The poet asks the Tágides (nymphs of the river Tagus) to give him &quot;a high and sublime sound,/ a grandiloquent and flowing style&quot; (&quot;um som alto e sublimado, / Um estilo grandíloquo e corrente&quot;). In contrast to the style of lyric poetry, or &quot;humble verse&quot; (&quot;verso humilde&quot;), he is thinking about this exciting tone of oratory. There are in the poem some speeches that are brief but notable, including Jupiter&#x27;s and the Old Man of the Restelo&#x27;s.

There are also descriptive passages, like the description of the palaces of Neptune and the Samorim of Calicute, the &quot;locus amoenus&quot; of the Island of Love (Canto IX), the dinner in the palace of Thetis (Canto X), and Gama&#x27;s cloth (end of Canto II). Sometimes these descriptions are like a slide show, in which someone shows each of the things described there; examples include the geographic start of Gama&#x27;s speech to the king of Melinde, certain sculptures of the palaces of Neptune and the Samorim, the speech of Paulo da Gama to the Catual, and the Machine of the World (&quot;Máquina do Mundo&quot;).

Examples of dynamic descriptions include the &quot;battle&quot; of the Island of Mozambique, the battles of Ourique and Aljubarrota, and the storm. Camões is a master in these descriptions, marked by the verbs of movement, the abundance of visual and acoustic sensations, and expressive alliterations. There are also many lyrical moments. Those texts are normally narrative-descriptive. This is the case with the initial part of the episode of the Sad Inês, the final part of the episode of the Adamastor, and the encounter on the Island of Love (Canto IX). All these cases resemble eclogues.

On several occasions the poet assumes a tone of lamentation, as at the end of Canto I, in parts of the speech of the Old Man of the Restelo, the end of Canto V, the beginning and end of Canto VII, and the final strophes of the poem. Many times, da Gama bursts into oration at challenging moments: in Mombasa (Canto II), on the appearance of Adamastor, and in the middle of the terror of the storm. The poet&#x27;s invocations to the Tágides and nymphs of Mondego (Cantos I and VII) and to Calliope (beginning of Cantos III and X), in typological terms, are also orations. Each one of these types of speech shows stylistic peculiarities.

==Synopses of Cantos==

===Canto I===

The epic begins with a dedication section, with the poet paying homage to Virgil and Homer. The first line mimics the opening line of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, and pays a hopeful tribute to the young King Sebastião. The story then (in imitation of the classical epics) portrays the gods of Greece watching over the voyage of Vasco da Gama. Just as the gods had divided loyalties during the voyages of Odysseus and Aeneas, here Venus, who favors the Portuguese, is opposed by Bacchus, who is here associated with the east and resents the encroachment on his territory. We encounter Vasco da Gama&#x27;s voyage &quot;in medias res&quot; as they have already rounded the Cape of Good Hope. At the urging of Bacchus, who is disguised as a Moor, the local Muslims plot to attack the explorer and his crew.

===Canto II===

Two scouts sent by Vasco da Gama are fooled by a fake altar created by Bacchus into thinking that there are Christians among the Muslims. Thus, the explorers are lured into an ambush but successfully survive with the aid of Venus. Venus pleads with her father Jove, who predicts great fortunes for the Portuguese in the east. The fleet lands at Melinde where it is welcomed by a friendly Sultan.

===Canto III===

After an appeal by the poet to Calliope, the Greek muse of epic poetry, Vasco da Gama begins to narrate the history of Portugal. He starts by referring to the situation of Portugal in Europe and the legendary story of Lusus and Viriathus. This is followed by passages on the meaning of Portuguese nationality and then by an enumeration of the warrior deeds of the 1st Dynasty kings, from Dom Afonso Henriques to Dom Fernando.

Episodes that stand out include Egas Moniz and the Battle of Ourique during Dom Afonso Henriques&#x27; reign, &quot;formosíssima Maria&quot; (the beautiful Maria, in 16th-century Portuguese) in the Battle of Salado, and Inês de Castro during Dom Afonso IV&#x27;s reign.

===Canto IV===

Vasco da Gama continues the narrative of the history of Portugal by recounting the story of the House of Aviz from the 1383–85 Crisis until the moment during the reign of Dom Manuel I when the armada of Vasco da Gama sails to India. The narrative of the Crisis of 1383–85, which focuses mainly on the figure of Nuno Álvares Pereira and the Battle of Aljubarrota, is followed by the events of the reigns of Dom João II, especially those related to expansion into Africa.

Following this incident, the poem narrates the maritime journey to India—an aim that Dom João II did not accomplish during his lifetime, but would come true with Dom Manuel, to whom the rivers Indus and Ganges appeared in dreams foretelling the future glories of the Orient. This canto ends with the sailing of the Armada, the sailors in which are surprised by the prophetically pessimistic words of an old man who was on the beach among the crowd. This is the episode of the Old Man of the Restelo.

===Canto V===

The story moves on to the King of Melinde, describing the journey of the Armada from Lisbon to Melinde. During the voyage, the sailors see the Southern Cross, St. Elmo&#x27;s Fire, and face a variety of dangers and obstacles such as the hostility of natives in the episode of Fernão Veloso, the fury of a monster in the episode of the giant Adamastor, and the disease and death caused by scurvy. Canto V ends with the poet&#x27;s censure of his contemporaries who despise poetry.

===Canto VI===

After Vasco da Gama&#x27;s narrative, the armada sails from Melinde guided by a pilot to teach them the way to Calicut. Bacchus, seeing that the Portuguese are about to arrive in India, asks for help of Neptune, who convenes a &quot;Concílio dos Deuses Marinhos&quot; (Council of the Sea Gods) whose decision is to support Bacchus and unleash powerful winds to sink the armada. Then, while the sailors are listening to Fernão Veloso telling the legendary and chivalrous episode of &quot;Os Doze de Inglaterra&quot; (The Twelve Men of England), a storm strikes.

Vasco da Gama, seeing the near destruction of his caravels, prays to his own God, but it is Venus who helps the Portuguese by sending the Nymphs to seduce the winds and calm them down. After the storm, the armada sights Calicut, and Vasco da Gama gives thanks to God. The canto ends with the poet speculating about the value of the fame and glory reached through great deeds.

===Canto VII===

After condemning some of the other nations of Europe (who in his opinion fail to live up to Christian ideals), the poet tells of the Portuguese fleet reaching the Indian city of Calicut. A Muslim named Monçaide greets the fleet and tells the explorers about the lands they have reached. The king, Samorin, hears of the newcomers and summons them. A governor and official of the king, called the Catual, leads the Portuguese to the king, who receives them well. The Catual speaks with Monçaide to learn more about the new arrivals. The Catual then goes to the Portuguese ships himself to confirm what Monsayeed has told him and is treated well.

===Canto VIII===

The Catual sees a number of paintings that depict significant figures and events from Portuguese history, all of which are detailed by the author. Bacchus appears in a vision to a Muslim priest in Samorin&#x27;s court and convinces him that the explorers are a threat. The priest spreads the warnings among the Catuals and the court, prompting Samorin to confront da Gama on his intentions. Da Gama insists that the Portuguese are traders, not buccaneers. The king then demands proof from da Gama&#x27;s ships, but when he tries to return to the fleet, da Gama finds that the Catual, who has been corrupted by the Muslim leaders, refuses to lend him a boat at the harbor and holds him prisoner. Da Gama manages to get free only after agreeing to have all of the goods on the ships brought to shore to be sold.

===Canto IX===

The Muslims plot to detain the Portuguese until the annual trading fleet from Mecca can arrive to attack them, but Monçaide tells da Gama of the conspiracy, and the ships escape from Calicut. To reward the explorers for their efforts, Venus prepares an island for them to rest on and asks her son Cupid to inspire Nereids with desire for them. When the sailors arrive on the Isle of Love, the ocean nymphs make a pretense of running but surrender quickly.

===Canto X===
During a sumptuous feast on the Isle of Love, Tethys, who is now the lover of da Gama, prophecies the future of Portuguese exploration and conquest. She tells of Duarte Pacheco Pereira&#x27;s defense of Cochin (Battle of Cochin); the Battle of Diu fought by Francisco de Almeida and his son Lourenço de Almeida against combined Gujarati-Egyptian fleets; the deeds of Tristão da Cunha, Pedro de Mascarenhas, Lopo Vaz de Sampaio and Nuno da Cunha; and battles fought by Martim Afonso de Sousa and João de Castro. Tethys then guides da Gama to a summit and reveals to him a vision of how the (Ptolemaic) universe operates. The tour continues with glimpses of the lands of Africa and Asia. The legend of the martyrdom of the apostle St. Thomas in India is told at this point. Finally, Tethys relates the voyage of Magellan. The epic concludes with more advice to young King Sebastião.

==Observations about some episodes==

===The Council of the Olympic gods===

This episode, which comes right after the first strophe of the narration (no. 19 of Canto I) and depicts the entry of the caravan of carracks in the poem, sailing into the unknown upon the sheet of white foam of the Indian Ocean, has huge significance in the organization of the poem. The gods of the four corners of the world are reunited to talk about &quot;the future matters of the East&quot; (&quot;as cousas futuras do Oriente&quot;); in fact, what they are going to decide is whether the Portuguese will be allowed to reach India and what will happen next.

The gods are described by Jupiter as residents of the &quot;shiny, / starry Pole and bright Seat&quot; (&quot;luzente, estelífero Pólo e claro Assento&quot;); this shiny, starry Pole and bright Seat or Olympus had already been described before as &quot;luminous&quot;; the Gods walk on the &quot;beautiful crystalline sky&quot; (&quot;cristalino céu fermoso&quot;), to the Milky Way. In strophes 22 and 23 they are also said to be shining. Jupiter is described as the &quot;Father&quot; (&quot;Padre&quot; – archaic Portuguese for &#x27;father&#x27;) who &quot;vibrates the fierce rays of Vulcan&quot; (&quot;vibra os feros raios de Vulcano&quot;) and presides from a &quot;crystalline seat of stars&quot; (&quot;assento de estrelas cristalino&quot;), carrying &quot;a gleaming crown and sceptre / of another rock clearer than diamond&quot; (&quot;hua coroa e ceptro rutilante / de outra pedra mais clara que diamante&quot;). Jupiter&#x27;s chair is a crystalline seat of stars and the rest of the Olympian furniture is equally ornate: &quot;In shiny seats, enamelled / of gold and pearls, under there were / the other gods (...)&quot; (&quot;Em luzentes assentos, marchetados / de ouro e perlas, mais abaixo estavam / os outros Deuses (...)&quot;).

During the council, the behaviour of the gods is described as disgraceful. It starts as &quot;Reason and Order demanded&quot; &quot;a Razão e a Ordem concertavam&quot;, but it ends in insubordination, to which Mars brutally puts an end.

Jupiter, after the end of his speech, entirely neglects the guidance of the other Gods, so two parties are formed: the party of Venus, favourable to the Portuguese, and the party of Bacchus, defending the interests of this god who wanted to stop the Portuguese from reaching their goal. The council ends by accepting the point of view earlier expressed by Jupiter; however, Bacchus will not accept this.

The speech that Jupiter uses to start the meeting is a finished piece of oratory. It opens with an exordium (1st strophe), in which, after an original welcome, Jupiter briefly defines the subject. This is followed, in the ancient rhetorical fashion, by the narration (the past shows that the intention of the Fados is the same one that the orator presented). There is then a confirmation of suggestions already put forth in the narration of the 4th strophe. This episode then ends with two strophes of peroration, where Jupiter appeals to the benevolence of the gods concerning the sons of Lusus, with Jupiter&#x27;s speech eventually settling the debate.

===A lyric-tragic episode===

The episode, usually known as &quot;of Inês de Castro&quot;, is one of the most famous of &quot;Os Lusíadas&quot; (canto iii, stanzas 118–135). It is normally classified as a lyric, thus distinguishing it from the more common war episodes. The episode discusses destiny, and leads the action to its tragic end, even something close to the &quot;coir&quot; (apostrophes).

The nobility of the characters is also emphasised, in a way that is intended to create feelings of sympathy when the protagonist suffers. This technique is used most strongly when Inês fears the orphaning of her children more than losing her own life and she begs for the commutation of capital punishment for an exile in Siberia (Cítia) or in Libya in order to have an opportunity to raise her children, and she is compared with &quot;the young beautiful Policena&quot;. Strophes 134 and 135 are written to evoke this pity.

===Adamastor===

The Adamastor episode is divided into three segments. The first, a theophany, goes from strophe 37 to 40; the second, which in chronological-narrative terms is a prolepsis, occupies strophes 41 to 48; finally, the third part, a marine eclogue with some points of contact with Écloga III of Camões, ends in strophe 59.

The vigorous theophany that the first part describes is in the following verses: &quot;Chill the flesh and the hairs/ to me and all [the others] only by listening and seeing him&quot; (&quot;Arrepiam-se as carnes e os cabelos / a mi e a todos só de ouvi-lo e vê-lo&quot;). This is intended to convey pure fear, the imminent threat of annihilation. The evil demigod is preceded by a black cloud, which appears above the heads of the sailors. Expressing the surprise he experiences, Gama quotes himself: &quot;Oh divine power – [I] said – sublimated, / what divine threat or what secret / this clime and this sea presents to us / that seems a bigger thing than a storm?&quot; (&quot;Ó potestade – disse – sublimada, / que ameaço divino ou que segredo / este clima e este mar nos apresenta, / que mor cousa parece que tormenta?&quot;) The &quot;strange Colossus&quot; (&quot;estranhíssimo &quot;): &quot;Rude son of the Earth&quot; (&quot;Filho aspérrimo da Terra&quot;) is described as having: &quot;huge stature&quot;, &quot;squalid beard&quot;, &quot;earthy colour&quot;, &quot;full of earth and crinkly of hairs / blacken the mouth, yellow the teeth&quot; (&quot;&quot;disforme estatura&quot;, &quot;barba esquálida&quot;, &quot;cor terrena&quot;, &quot;cheios de terra e crespos os cabelos / a boca negra, os dentes, amarelos&quot;&quot;).

Such emphasis on the appearance of Adamastor is intended to contrast with the preceding scenery, which was expressed as: &quot;seas of the South&quot; (&quot;mares do Sul&quot;): &quot;(...) / the winds blowing favourably / when one night, being careless/ watching in the cutting bow, / (...)&quot; (&quot;(...) / prosperamente os ventos assoprando, / quando hua noite, estando descuidados / na cortadora proa vigiando, / (...)&quot;). The final marine eclogue conforms to a pattern that is common to many of Camões&#x27; lyrical compositions: falling in love, forced separation, grieving over the frustrated dream.

===The eclogue of the Island of Love===

The &quot;locus amoenus&quot;: the strophes that come after strophe 52 of Canto IX, and some of the main parts that appear from strophe 68 to 95 describe the scenery where the love encountered between the sailors and the Nymphs take place. The poet also talks about the fauna that live there and of fruits produced instantly. It is portrayed as a paradise.

The allegory in the second part of Canto IX sees Camões describing the scene between the sailors – whom the Nymphs were expecting – prepared by Venus. Given in an allegoric sense:
The Canto is ended with the poet communicating to the reader:
===The Machine of the World===

In Canto X, before the sailors return home the Siren invites Gama to the spectacle of the Machine of the World (&quot;Máquina do Mundo&quot;) with these words:
The Machine of the World is presented as the spectacle unique, divine, seen by &quot;corporeal eyes&quot;. In the words of literary historian António José Saraiva, &quot;it is one of the supreme successes of Camões&quot;, &quot;the spheres are transparent, luminous, all of them are seen at the same time with equal clarity; they move, and the movement is perceptible, although the visible surface is always the same. To be able to translate this by the &quot;painting that talks&quot; is to achieve one of the highest points in universal literature.&quot;

==Responses==

Manuel de Faria e Sousa wrote a commentary about the work in the 17th century. Published after Sousa&#x27;s death, the work was originally written in Spanish and eventually translated into Portuguese in the 19th century.

<text>The Philippine National Railways (PNR) (; ) is a state-owned railway company in the Philippines which operates one commuter rail service between Laguna and Quezon, and local services between Sipocot, Naga and Legazpi in the Bicol Region. It is an attached agency of the Department of Transportation. 

Philippine National Railways traces its roots to the Ferrocarril de Manila-Dagupan, founded on November 24, 1892 during the Spanish colonial period, and later becoming the Manila Railroad Company (MRR) during the American colonial period. Founded on June 20, 1964, by virtue of Republic Act No. 4156, the PNR used to operate over of route from La Union to the Bicol Region. However, neglect reduced the railway&#x27;s service, and persistent problems with informal settlers in the 1990s and natural disasters in the 2000s contributed further to its decline. The government is currently in the process of reinvesting in the railway through numerous projects set to revive defunct lines and create new ones.

==History==
===Manila Railroad===

The origins of the Philippine National Railways can be traced to Edmund Sykes&#x27;s concession, the Manila Railway Company, Limited. Sykes was granted concession rights by the Spanish government to construct a rail line from Manila to Dagupan on June 1, 1887. The line opened as the Ferrocarril de Manila a Dagupan on November 24, 1892, and the Manila Railway Company was formally incorporated in Manila and London. The Ferrocarril de Manila a Dagupan would eventually become the North Main Line, while services to Southern Luzon under the South Main Line would be completed by 1937.

The Manila Railway was later renamed the Manila Railroad Company in 1906 and became a state-owned enterprise in 1916. By 1923, the MRR elected José Paez as its first Filipino general manager. By 1939, the MRR had of track throughout Luzon. However, the MRR&#x27;s network and fleet was destroyed during World War II. With most of the railroads rebuilt by the 1950s, the MRR initiated its transition from steam to diesel power. Flagship services with steam ended on August 12, 1956, while regular services ended in 1963. Not long after, the Manila Railroad was reorganized into the Philippine National Railways.

===Creation of the PNR and later decline===
The Philippine National Railways was created in 1964 through the Republic Act 4156 during the presidency of Diosdado Macapagal. According to the PNR&#x27;s website, the agency experienced its heyday during its early years in the 1960s and early 1970s, as it served thousands of daily riders in its system and had an expansive commuter rail network in and out of Metro Manila.

The PNR later suffered from a multitude of reasons which contributed to its decline, including natural disasters and a lack of support from the government. Government funding during the 1970s were shifted to road-based infrastructure such as highways. On July 23, 1979, President Ferdinand Marcos issued Executive Order No. 546, which designated the Philippine National Railways as an attached agency of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications, now the Department of Transportation (DOTr). However, it did not prevent the agency from suffering heavy losses. In 1983, underfunding has resulted in more cutting of services and the layoff of 1,000 employees which resulted in protests the following year.

The decline of the railway became evident as sections of North Main Line closed in stages. In 1984, services were cut short to Paniqui, Tarlac due to a bridge collapse. Services were then again cut short to Caloocan in 1988 during the term of President Corazon Aquino. However, commuter services were briefly extended to Malolos starting in 1990 under the &quot;Metrotren&quot; project and later closed in 1997. When Fidel V. Ramos succeeded Aquino, he decided to rehabilitate the South Main Line from Tutuban to Legaspi, and appointed Jose B. Dado as the new PNR general manager. A railway system running from Manila to Clark was also set to be constructed in the 1990s, when Ramos signed a memorandum of agreement with Juan Carlos I of Spain for its construction in September 1994. Another project, called the Manila–Calabarzon Express, sought to rehabilitate the south commuter line in Manila and construct spur lines. However, the two projects were not implemented, with the Clark railway project cancelled due to disagreement on the source of funding. 

===Contemporary history===

==== Rehabilitation ====

The government under the administration of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo actively pursued the rehabilitation of the Philippine National Railways through various investments and projects designed to revive Philippine rail transport, despite the numerous problems involved. This encompassed three major projects: Northrail, Southrail, and the Northrail–Southrail Linkage, which was designed to connect the two systems. The Northrail project aimed to revive the North Main Line from Caloocan to San Fernando, La Union. The initial phase involved the upgrading of the existing single track to an elevated dual-track system, converting the rail gauge from narrow gauge to standard gauge, and linking Manila to Malolos in Bulacan and further on to Angeles City, Clark Special Economic Zone, Clark International Airport. Although the project was under the North Luzon Railways Corporation (NLRC), the Northrail project aimed to utilize the existing right of way of the North Main Line for most of its route. The Southrail project, conceptualized when the PNR and Daewoo conducted a feasibility study, involved the rehabilitation of the entire South Main Line from Calamba to Lucena, and later to Legazpi, Albay, with a new extension to Matnog. The linkage project aimed to connect the two, and ensure compatibility of the signaling and communication systems of the two lines while retaining the rail gauge as narrow gauge despite the planned gauge conversion.

On September 14, 2002, a memorandum of understanding was signed by NLRC and China National Machinery and Equipment Group (CNMEG) for the Northrail project. The Northrail project was contracted out by the Arroyo administration in 2003 to China National Machinery and Equipment Corporation (CNMEC) for an original cost of $421 million. This project was estimated to cost around US$500 million, with China offering to provide some US$400 million in concessionary financing. Early construction began in 2006. However, the project would soon be plagued by a series of irregularities involving the foreign contractor, leading to repeated halts and restarts of the project; the cost of the railway later surged to US$2 billion. 

On July 14, 2009, President Arroyo presided over the launch of new diesel multiple units from Hyundai Rotem. This coincided with PNR&#x27;s rebranding under a new brand name, &quot;PNR Filtrack&quot;, although the succeeding administration decided to revert these changes. While plans for Southrail were not fully realized, the initial phase of the linkage project from Caloocan to Alabang, financed by the Export–Import Bank of Korea and the Korean Economic Development Cooperation Fund, was completed in 2010. Total reconstruction of rail bridges and tracks, including replacement of the current 35-kilogram (77-pound) track with newer 50-kilogram (110-pound) tracks and the refurbishing of stations, were part of the rehabilitation and expansion process. 

Northrail was finally cancelled in 2011 by President Benigno Aquino III on lingering legal issues and corruption allegations. Nevertheless, rehabilitation of the railway continued, with the San Cristobal bridge in Calamba, Laguna being rebuilt in May 2011. The Bicol Express train service was inaugurated on June 29, with a maiden voyage between Manila and Naga, Camarines Sur plus a return trip back to the terminus on July 1. This inaugural trip was marred by the collapse of the embankment at Malaguico, Sipocot. It was discovered before the train passed through and was repaired. The restored Bicol Express intercity service was offered on a daily basis, running mostly during nighttime. Following a derailment incident, the Bicol Express service was indefinitely suspended on October 26, 2012, leaving only the Metro Commuter Line in operation.

====Current developments====

Despite attempts to restart and reconfigure the Northrail project, by 2015, it was replaced by a new project that sought to revitalize the PNR, called the North–South Railway Project (NSRP), was approved by the government. It involved two lines, NSRP North and South. The north line is analogous to the existing North Main Line; its first phase is the North–South Commuter Railway (NSCR), a , electrified narrow gauge commuter railway from Tutuban to Malolos funded through official development assistance (ODA) from Japan. The second phase entailed the rebuilding of the line&#x27;s long-haul services to La Union. Meanwhile, the south line included the reconstruction of the existing Metro Commuter line from Tutuban to Calamba as well as the rehabilitation of the South Main Line with an extension up to Matnog, Sorsogon and a branch line from Calamba to Batangas. The latter phase of the north line, as well as the entire south line, were to be funded through a public–private partnership (PPP) scheme.

These plans would later be modified by the succeeding government under President Rodrigo Duterte. The NSCR was extended to New Clark City. It was also expanded to include the reconstruction of the Metro Commuter line, which was now also to be financed through ODA from Japan. Meanwhile, the planned long-haul portion of the south line was reconstituted as the South Long Haul project, which would involve the reconstruction of the South Main Line. It was to be funded by China, although this was later withdrawn after several delays and a slow negotiation process with the Chinese government. Furthermore, all new railway lines were now to be constructed using standard gauge, as opposed to the narrow gauge that is currently in use by PNR.

After nearly 20 years, PNR reopened the Metro North Commuter line, and launched the Caloocan–Dela Rosa shuttle line, on August 1, 2018. This would be followed by a steady expansion and reintroduction of rail services to the north, currently reaching to Malabon, which has not seen rail activity for nearly 20 years. A plan to reactivate the Carmona line was bared as well, and the revival of cargo rail from Port Area, Manila to Laguna is now being planned.

On November 16, 2018, PNR became a provisional member of International Union of Railways. On June 14, 2019, PNR became ISO 9001-certified (ISO 9001:2015) for railway repair, rehabilitation, restoration and maintenance, train control and rolling stock maintenance, station operation and other related services. The certification was announced on October 2, 2019.

On February 16, 2023, the Department of Transportation announced a temporary suspension of operations of the PNR system for five years to give way for the construction of the NSCR. Transport Undersecretary for Railways Cesar Chavez said that the temporary suspension would save the government while construction on the new railway line is ongoing. The Alabang–Calamba segment was the first to be closed on July 2, while the Tutuban–Alabang segment followed suit on March 28, 2024. New PUV franchises traversing parallel the PNR route were issued to compensate for the five-year closure. Services in the Bicol Region were expanded on December 23, 2023.

==Operations and services==

The PNR currently operates in Laguna, and Quezon province and Bicol region. At the last years of regular intercity service along the system&#x27;s entire length in the late 1980s, it served from Tutuban to San Fernando, La Union on the North Main Line and Legazpi, Albay on the South Main Line. Various branch lines also led to Batangas, Cavite, Nueva Ecija, Rizal and Tarlac. One of the branch lines that led to Carmona was intended to be reopened by 2019. This was not yet realized , presumably due to the COVID-19 pandemic, among other developments.

On March 27, 2024, the PNR suspended its operations in Metro Manila, specifically the Gov. Pascual to Bicutan and the Tutuban to Alabang segments for at least five years to make way for the construction of the North-South Commuter Railway (NSCR), which will run on the same route as the old tracks, albeit elevated and will use electrification and the standard gauge, the first in PNR. The old tracks beneath the elevated segments will be restored for future freight services as well as connection to the PNR South Main Line and eventually the South Long Haul.

The PNR operates almost every day of the year unless otherwise announced. Special schedules via the social media pages of the agency and also in newspapers and other mass media. During Holy Week, a public holiday in the Philippines, operations are suspended for annual maintenance, owing to fewer commuters and traffic around the metro. Normal operation resumes on Easter Sunday.

===Summary of services===
===Metro Commuter Line===
====Metro North Commuter====
The reactivated &quot;Metro North Commuter&quot; ran initially from Caloocan to Makati and uses a single special fare matrix of for ordinary, and for air-conditioned. This was later extended to reach FTI in Taguig, now with a distance-based fare matrix. A Caloocan-Tutuban shuttle service also exists, using the original right-of-way once used for the Dagupan line. Originally terminating at 10th Avenue station while the historical Caloocan station was still being prepared for activation, the station now terminates at its originally intended station since September 10.

DOTr and PNR have laid out plans in reactivating rail services in areas prepared for NorthRail, such as Malabon and possibly Valenzuela. First proposed and planned last September 2018, the extension to Gov. Pascual Avenue and the re-establishment of the Governor Pascual Station (formerly called Acacia Station) in Malabon has been done, with new rail ties and narrow gauge rail tracks restored. It reopened to the public on December 3, 2018.

Another extension, this time targeting Valenzuela City (Polo area) has been bared on August 14, 2019, and will require rebuilding a railway bridge crossing Tullahan river that has been previously demolished.

The line is provisional, and services were interrupted with the construction of NSCR elevated tracks underway, with the northern area commencing upon the conclusion of the construction of NLEX Segment 10.1. However, despite the new rails being removed again, the at-grade reconstructed lines will be retained and are targeted for freight use as well as part of the system&#x27;s extension/reintroduction to the north.

The trains used in this service was the Hyundai Rotem DMUs and 8000 class DMUs, with the KiHa 52 DMU and KiHa 350 DMU formerly used in this service.

====Metro South Commuter====
The &quot;Metro Commuter&quot; (also known by then-remaining active service &quot;MSC&quot; or &quot;Metro South Commuter&quot;), which was formerly called &quot;Commuter Express &quot;(also &quot;Commex&quot;), serves as the commuter rail service for the Manila metropolitan area, extending as far south as Calamba and Los Baños, both in Laguna. The PNR uses GE locomotives such as 900 Class, 2500 Class, and 5000 Class hauling 203 series EMUs, including 18 (3 car trains, 6 sets) Hyundai Rotem DMUs, KiHa 52 DMUs, the PT INKA 8000 class DMUs, 8100 class DMUs, and the INKA CC300 locomotive with 8300 class coaches for this service. The 8000 class DMUs occasionally perform &quot;MSC&quot; trips when the Hyundai Rotem DMUs occupy the Metro North Commuter trips. The GE locomotives formerly haul 7A-2000 12 series Commex passenger coaches. &quot;MSC &quot; service using the Hyundai Rotem DMUs, KiHa 52, KiHa 350, 203 series EMUs, 8000 class and 8100 class DMUs, and the INKA CC300 locomotive with 8300 class coaches is currently offered between Tutuban and Alabang in Muntinlupa. Currently, MSC makes 32 return services, 16 in each direction.

====Shuttle Service====
The &quot;Shuttle Service&quot; is a commuter rail service initially introduced on January 27, 2014. This service used Hyundai Rotem DMUs and JR KiHa 52. There were 2 routes of the Shuttle Service, where trains stop at all stations along the routes: Tutuban – Sucat and Santa Mesa – Sucat. This train service ended May 23, 2014, to conduct maintenance on the rolling stocks and due to the consecutive three weeks of delays and cancellations of this train service.

Formerly, plans for a third route plying Alabang – Calamba was to be introduced sometime in 2017. This service would use the reliveried two-car KiHa 350; This did not push through in 2018. However, with the commissioning of the new DOST Hybrid Train in 2019, this route is now under test run, currently free of charge, but with limited schedules.

In 2018, a new shuttle line was introduced with the 10th Avenue – Dela Rosa route since August 1, 2018, as part of the renovation of the line and the return of train services to Caloocan. The revived train service had its first extension towards Sangandaan, the original Caloocan station since September 10, extending through FTI. Since December 3, 2018, the line was extended northwards to Governor Pascual (formerly called Acacia) in Malabon, and since December 16, 2019, the shuttle service was extended southwards to Bicutan as its new terminus from FTI.

A new shuttle line leading to the once-abandoned Carmona branch line is planned for reopening in 2019, and will originate from the Dela Rosa station in Makati City.

===Bicol Commuter===
The &quot;Bicol Commuter&quot; service is a commuter rail service in the Bicol Region, between stations in Tagkawayan, Quezon, and Legazpi, Albay, with Naga in Camarines Sur acting as a central terminal. It has three services: Tagkawayan-Naga (suspended), Sipocot-Naga (operational), and Naga-Legazpi (operational)

The service was first launched on September 16, 2009 as Tagkawayan-Naga and Naga-Ligao. The trains were planned to make seven trips a day, alternating between Tagkawayan, Sipocot, Naga City and Legazpi. All services used KiHa 52 in revised blue livery.

However after further reductions, only the service between Sipocot and Naga was operating by December 2013. Service resumed between Naga and Legazpi on September 18, 2015, with one train a day. However, services were again cut in April 2017 due to an absence of rolling stock, which was worsened by a succession of typhoons that damaged railroads in the Bicol region.

Definitive plans to restore the entire route from Sipocot, Naga and Legazpi were bared with an inspection trip from Tutuban on September 20, 2019, with a rerailment crew, including certain areas of Quezon Province, in preparation of the restoration of more routes previously suspended. 
First to be restored was the operation of the Naga-Sipocot segment of the Bicol Commuter service in 2022. On the 31th of July 2022, the PNR resumed operations between Ligao and Naga, with two daily trips in service. The Naga–Legazpi route was reopened on December 27, 2023, six years after its suspension in April 2017 due to insufficient trains.

, the train used for the Naga-Legazpi Route is the 8300 class coaches pulled by a INKA CC300 locomotive. While the 8000 class DMU is used in the Naga - Sipocot Line.

==Defunct services==
===Intercity services===
PNR&#x27;s intercity operations on its two main lines, the North Main Line and South Main Line, both located in Luzon, have been indefinitely suspended since 2014.

The South Main Line then served as the primary intercity service after the permanent closure of the northern line in 1991. However, PNR also ended its regular intercity services in 2006 due to natural disasters and poor track conditions, although the &quot;Bicol Express&quot; ran irregularly between 2009 and 2014. In Camarines Sur, liquefaction of the track&#x27;s embankment caused a section of the line in Sipocot to sink. This allowed the inaugural service of the new &quot;Bicol Express&quot; in 2011 to slow down to a near-stop while passing through the area.

There are plans to revitalize both lines. The North Main Line is currently reserved for building the fully-elevated portion of the North–South Commuter Railway to Capas, Tarlac. The South Main Line is planned to be rebuilt and extended to Matnog, Sorsogon. The spur line to Batangas City will also be rebuilt. Test runs along the South Main Line were conducted in September 2019. On September 21, 2019, a KiHa 59 and a rerailment train consisting of a newly repainted PNR 900 class locomotive and a CMC coach conducted a test run from Tutuban to Naga.

====North Main Line services====

The North Main Line was first opened when the Manila–Dagupan Railway was opened in 1892. At its height between the 1950s and 1960s, the line once boasted full double-track railways from Tutuban to Dagupan and also served until San Fernando, La Union. It also had branch lines to various areas in Central Luzon. However, its services severely deteriorated in the 1980s. All regular operations outside Metro Manila ended in 1988. However, there was irregular service to Meycauayan railway station until all stations in Central Luzon were closed by the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo.

====South Main Line services====

Intercity services on the South Main Line ran between Manila and Legazpi between 1916 and 2014, including the intermittent &quot;Bicol Express&quot; and &quot;Mayon/Isarog Limited&quot; services between 2009 and 2014. The services also briefly extended to Sorsogon in the 1960s due to the trains&#x27; popularity as a form of transportation with the masses.

===Non-passenger services===

Freight services used to be a key component of PNR&#x27;s operations, and the same applies to its predecessors being the Manila Railway and Railroad companies. Freight services lasted until 2003 when International Container Terminal Services used PNR tracks to transfer intermodal containers from the Port of Manila to its facility in Cabuyao, Laguna. Since then, there have been proposals to revive freight services as part of its PNR Long Haul projects.

The Manila Railroad was also the owner of the Manila Hotel during its early years prior to its handover to the Government Services Insurance System. They also hosted &quot;hospital trains&quot; in the 1930s, with 70 class tank locomotive No. 79 and a converted American Car-built express coach used as a hospital.

==Station list==
The Philippine National Railways operates on two main lines, the North Main Line and the South Main Line, alongside three major spur lines, which served various parts of Luzon with its 138 (once) active stations.

===Station layout===
All PNR stations were and are presently at-grade, with most stations using a side platform layout. Most have only basic amenities, platforms and ticket booths. Rehabilitated stations along the Metro Manila line have been fitted with ramps for passengers using wheelchairs. Several stations have extended platforms, having an upper platform catering to DMU services, and a lower platform for regular locomotive-hauled services. As of August 2017, most of the stations are being extended and equipped with platform-length roofing, better ticketing office, and restrooms.

Future railway systems under the PNR, such as the North–South Commuter Railway line, will have elevated, at-grade, and depressed stations similar to that of Manila LRT and MRT stations.

==Modernization and expansion plans==
The PNR system has suffered from decades of neglect and therefore, several plans to restore and expand the network has been proposed by various administrations. The Republic of Korea, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Japan and Indonesia have contributed to these plans. Most of these concern the revitalization and modernization projects of the mainlines in Luzon. The government plans a complete overhaul of the PNR system, which involves electrification and conversion from narrow gauge to standard gauge, as well as from single to double track. The standard gauge system is estimated to have a total track length of around .

===Urban rail systems===
====North–South Commuter Railway====

The North–South Commuter Railway (NSCR) is the latest project to revitalize both the historic North and South Main Lines, particularly sections in the Greater Manila Area. First planned in the 1990s, the project&#x27;s previous incarnations were hounded by funding problems and disagreements. It finally came into shape in November 2017 after a resolution of a five-year dispute between the government and a Chinese contractor. The NSCR will be a 36 station, elevated railway system from New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac to Calamba, Laguna. It will be the first electrified main line in the country. Construction on the railway began in 2019. Once fully completed by 2025, it will accommodate at least 300,000 passengers between Northern Metro Manila and Bulacan alone. While the elevated line will be served by electrified trains, the existing lines below will be used for freight trains and/or existing commuter trains.

====MRT Line 8====

As part of the infrastructure program by president Rodrigo Duterte, East-West Rail was proposed by the East-West Rail Transit Corp., a consortium between Megawide, A. Brown Company Inc., and Private Equity Investment and Development Corp. It involves the financing, design, construction, and maintenance of a mostly-elevated rapid transit line from Diliman in Quezon City to Quiapo in Manila. In 2018, the PNR has said that it will help in building and operating the line. The line will have 11 stations on of mostly elevated track. The project is currently awaiting approval from NEDA to proceed. It is also currently tackling right-of-way issues, such as that of the España Boulevard alignment.

===Intercity rail systems===

==== PNR South Long Haul ====

The South Long Haul project, also known as PNR Bicol, is a planned reconstruction of the intercity line between Metro Manila and the Bicol Region. Originally proposed as a simple reconstruction of the existing network at narrow-gauge and a maximum speed of , the project now involves a complete overhaul of the railway and its conversion to standard-gauge, replacing the existing line. The line will be initially built as a single-track system. However, there are provisions for an upgrade to double-track or electrification in the future. Stations will be allowed to use passing sidings so that express train travel is uninterrupted.

====Mindanao Railway====

President Rodrigo Duterte expressed his support for the establishment of a railway system in the entire island of Mindanao which could be in operation after his term ends. The railway system to be built in Mindanao will have about 2,000 kilometers of track, and considered one of Rodrigo Duterte&#x27;s primary infrastructure projects. The first phase, which is , would start construction in the third quarter of 2018 and was expected to be completed by 2022.

===Freight revival===
In 2016, PNR has been interested in reviving its freight services with a planned signing of a memorandum of agreement between the railway and rail freight operator MRAIL (a Meralco subsidiary firm) for the rehabilitation of the rail lines to North Harbor and to restart the freight services starting 2017, which will also help reduce traffic congestion and truck use in the NCR. If completed, MRail will jointly operate the freight service with the PNR, which will end a long absence of railway freight services in the country. This will be the second time the PNR will partner with ICTSI.

A statement made by MRail Inc., a subsidiary of Metro Pacific Investments Corp., said that discussions regarding PNR freight service revival from Port of Manila to the Laguna Gateway Inland Container Terminal resulted in the appointment of a new board at the Philippine National Railways. Representatives of PNR and ICTSI conducted an inspection of the ROW where the former railtracks leading to the North Harbor existed, signalling the start of the action to realize the cargo rail revival.

, the freight revival plans are currently not in effect, as with the agency&#x27;s other railway plans, the cause presumed to be the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Rolling stock==

PNR has operated several types of locomotives, carriages and multiple units as part of its fleet. As of 2019, the rolling stock used are primarily powered by diesel. The DOST Hybrid Electric Train may also function as a battery electric multiple unit although it is started by a diesel engine. All present rolling stock are in . PNR also has rail mounted cranes as supporting equipment with varying capacities between .

In late 2019, improvements with the current rolling stocks have been seen. KiHa 59 KoGaNe, KiHa 350 Set 3, and two sets of Hyundai Rotem DMUs received a new blue-orange livery with window screen. One unit of 900 Class has been overhauled and repainted to blue-orange and filtrack livery. PNR also have expanded their line and added more trips in their service, KoGaNe has served the Tutuban-Calamba Line (Limited Chosen Stops only) from October 24 to December 2, 2019, then got extended to IRRI in Los Baños, Laguna on December 3, 2019. KiHa 350 Set 3 also have served the Alabang-Calamba-IRRI Line but it only lasted a couple of weeks, PNR train will go to bicol after renovation of railway tracks.

==Liveries==
The Manila-Dagupan Railway, the Manila Railroad Company and the Philippine National Railways sported various liveries representing various eras of the company, usually to celebrate the arrival of new rolling stock. Each of these are painted by hand.

===Steam locomotive era (1892–1954)===
There were no available colored images of Manila-Dagupan Railway and the Manila Railroad Company&#x27;s rolling stock before the war so the color scheme of the carriages remains unknown. However, based on the surviving locomotives, the steam locomotives owned by the two companies sported a black-only livery like most of the notable American steam engines.

===Railmotor livery (1948)===
The Cummins railmotors were colored black or white, and orange. The pre-war carriages salvaged and refurbished in the late 1940s also used this color scheme.

===MRR/PNR livery (1955)===

The MRR celebrated the arrival of its first diesel rolling stock with its colors changed to dark green and yellow, or alternately to yellow-orange and dark green. The livery was retained when the Philippine government took over and renamed it the Philippine National Railways. During the transition to PNR, the old MRR monogram with a diamond-shaped seal was painted out and the PNR circular seal and monogram was placed on the front of the cab with yellow wing-like symbols outside it. The PNR acronym is also placed on the sides as well. By the 1980s, the diesel multiple units will have a yellow body and the wing-like symbols are colored dark green. A few locomotives sported a yellow-orange livery at that time.

===Commuter Motor Coach livery (c. 1978)===
During the late 1970s, the Commuter Motor Coaches used on PNR&#x27;s local train services in Metro Manila and the Bicol Region was colored white and navy blue.

===Metrotren livery (1990)===
When President Corazon Aquino inaugurated the rebranded Manila commuter service as &quot;Metrotren&quot; in 1990, the CMC coaches were repainted to navy blue, white and red. This was also used for the 1998 restocking of the &quot;Bicol Express&quot; with the old &quot;Peñafrancia Express&quot; IC-888 train. This was used until the mid-2000s when both multiple unit types were changed to the navy blue livery.

===Philippines 2000 livery (1997)===
The GE Universal Series-based 900, 2500 and 5000 classes sported a red livery celebrating Fidel Ramos&#x27; Philippines 2000 program. Although the PNR revised this livery after 2000, some retained it due to lack of maintenance funds and a 900 class survived with this livery in use until 2008. Some of the freight carriages had the Philippines 2000 name spray-painted on top the old green and yellow livery.

===Navy blue livery (c. 2000, 2011)===

A navy blue livery was introduced after the expiry of the Philippines 2000 program. This followed after PNR acquired locomotive-hauled 12 and 14 series coaches from Japan. There are subtle differences with the coaches used on the &quot;Commuter Express&quot; (formerly &quot;Metrotren&quot;) and the &quot;Bicol Express&quot;. The &quot;Commuter Express&quot; trainsets were navy blue with orange highlights while the &quot;Bicol Express&quot; were navy blue with gold highlights. The PNR symbol on the &quot;Commuter Express&quot; was white while on the &quot;Bicol Express&quot; was gold. The locomotives&#x27; colors were also changed to navy blue and orange.

This livery was re-introduced in 2011 although it was not used on the &quot;Bicol Express&quot; trainsets.

===Filtrack livery (2009)===

PNR attempted to revitalize the &quot;Bicol Express&quot; in 2009 with the support of president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. This was supported with a change of logo and liveries. The coaches in PNR service used white and orange while the locomotives&#x27; cabs were colored white while the PNR monogram logo was sealed out. The trains also sported the &quot;Filtrack&quot; brand on the coaches and on the side of the locomotives. However, this was short lived after the &quot;Bicol Express&quot; stopped its services indefinitely. By 2015, all of the rolling stock followed the 2000s navy blue livery.

===INKA livery (2019)===

The PNR announced another logo change and changes to its livery in 2019. This is after the Duterte administration under the Department of Transportation announced major reforms to the PNR. The PNR&#x27;s monogram is now fully incorporated on a seal-type logo, bearing the agency&#x27;s name and the year it was founded. The seal was also changed from orange and blue to golden yellow and blue. At the same time, the rolling stock also changed its liveries with regards to the arrival of the new rolling stock from Indonesia. The 203 series-based passenger cars&#x27; liveries did not change as of 2022.

The first among the old rolling stock was the KiHa 350 and KiHa 59 series trains. After this was the Hyundai Rotem DMUs and finally, 900 series locomotives DEL 917, 902, 913, 921, and 922, 5000 series locomotive DEL 5007 and 5001, and 2500 series locomotive DEL 2540 changed its livery to orange. All multiple units were fitted with new window screen to resist stoning. The colors however varied from one type of rolling stock to another but the common theme was the inclusion of orange (as the highlight color), white (as the main stock color), navy blue (as the side line color) and black (as the bottom color).

===CRRC diesel multiple unit livery (2021)===

The latest effort to the revitalization of the South Main Line, particularly the &quot;Bicol Express&quot; intercity service, was unveiled in 2019 dubbed the &quot;South Long Haul&quot; project. A scale model of the train that would have been used was revealed during a contract signing ceremony between the Philippine National Railways, its superior agency the Department of Transportation, and the Chinese rolling stock manufacturer CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive. The three-car train will also feature a red-orange livery with black stripes on its windows. This train would have arrived in 2021.

However, on February 24, 2021, PNR cancelled the contract with CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive due to the procurement process being questioned by the Commission on Audit, and the failure of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive to submit post-qualification bidding requirements.

===NSCR electric multiple unit livery (2021)===
In line with the construction of the North–South Commuter Railway, the Department of Transportation ordered 104 train cars (13 sets) of electric multiple units from Sumitomo Corporation and Japan Transport Engineering Company on July 16, 2019. The original proposal featured a bluish-purple livery in the 2019 scale model of the Sustina Commuter.

However, the livery design was changed when PNR revealed a mock-up of the front cab for the PNR EM10000 class trains on June 29, 2021. The livery now features a red-orange color livery and eagle design highlights on the sides of the lead cars of the train.

<doc id="371942" wikidata="Q146393" url="?curid=371942" title="Polyvinylidene fluoride">
<text>Polyvinylidene fluoride or polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) is a highly non-reactive thermoplastic fluoropolymer produced by the polymerization of vinylidene difluoride. Its chemical formula is (C2H2F2)&quot;n&quot;.

PVDF is a specialty plastic used in applications requiring the highest purity, as well as resistance to solvents, acids and hydrocarbons. PVDF has low density 1.78 g/cm3 in comparison to other fluoropolymers, like polytetrafluoroethylene.

It is available in the form of piping products, sheet, tubing, films, plate and an insulator for premium wire. It can be injected, molded or welded and is commonly used in the chemical, semiconductor, medical and defense industries, as well as in lithium-ion batteries. It is also available as a cross-linked closed-cell foam, used increasingly in aviation and aerospace applications, and as an exotic 3D printer filament. It can also be used in repeated contact with food products, as it is FDA-compliant and non-toxic below its degradation temperature.

As a fine powder grade, it is an ingredient in high-end paints for metals. These PVDF paints have extremely good gloss and color retention. They are in use on many prominent buildings around the world, such as the Petronas Towers in Malaysia and Taipei 101 in Taiwan, as well as on commercial and residential metal roofing.

PVDF membranes are used in western blots for the immobilization of proteins, due to its non-specific affinity for amino acids.

PVDF is also used as a binder component for the carbon electrode in supercapacitors and for other electrochemical applications.

==Names==
PVDF is sold under a variety of brand names including KF (Kureha), Hylar (Solvay), Kynar (Arkema) and Solef (Solvay).

===Synthesis===
The easiest way of synthesizing PVDF is the radical polymerization of vinylidene fluoride (VF2), however, the polymerization is not completely regiospecific. The asymmetric structure of VF2 leads to the orientation isomers during the polymerization. The configuration of the monomer in the chain can be either &quot;head to head&quot; or &quot;head to tail&quot;.

To get more control on the regiospecific polymer synthesis, copolymerization was proposed. One of these methods is introducing the precursor polymer made from copolymerization of VF2 with either 1-chloro-2,2-difluoroethylene (CVF2) or 1-bromo-2,2-difluoroethylene( BVF2). The chlorinated or brominated monomers are attacked at their CF2 carbon by growing –CH2CF2∙ radical. After reductive dechlorination or debromination with tri-n-butyltin hydride they become a reversed VF2 unit in the final polymer. Therefore, a regioisomer of PVDF is formed.

==Properties==
In 1969, strong piezoelectricity was observed in PVDF, with the piezoelectric coefficient of poled (placed under a strong electric field to induce a net dipole moment) thin films as large as 6–7 pC/N: 10 times larger than that observed in any other polymer.

PVDF has a glass transition temperature (&quot;T&quot;g) of about −35 °C and is typically 50–60% crystalline. To give the material its piezoelectric properties, it is mechanically stretched to orient the molecular chains and then poled under tension. PVDF exists in several phases depending on the chain conformations as trans (T) or gauche (G) linkages: TGTG&#x27; for α and δ phase, TTTT for β phases, and TTTGTTTG&#x27; for γ and ε phases. The α and ε conformations lack piezoelectric properties because of the antiparallel alignment of dipoles within its unit cell. The β, γ, and δ phases feature a parallel arrangement of dipoles, rendering them polar crystals with a non-zero dipole moment. Among these phases, the β phase stands out due to its remarkable remnant polarization and the highest dipolar moment per unit cell, garnering more interest compared to the others. When poled, PVDF is a ferroelectric polymer, exhibiting efficient piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties. These characteristics make it useful in sensor and battery applications. Thin films of PVDF are used in some newer thermal camera sensors.

Unlike other popular piezoelectric materials, such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT), PVDF has a negative d33 value. Physically, this means that PVDF will compress instead of expand or vice versa when exposed to the same electric field.

=== Thermal ===
Fluorinated polymers like PTFE and PVDF are especially thermally stable due to strong carbon-fluorine (C–F) bonds, the strongest in organic chemistry, which contribute to the durability of these materials under heat. PVDF is semi-crystalline, giving it a balance of rigidity and flexibility across temperatures from −35 °C to 160 °C. Above 316 °C, PVDF decomposes via dehydrofluorination, which can lead to structural changes, including double bonds and potential discoloration from thermal decomposition.

=== Chemical compatibility ===
PVDF exhibits an increased chemical resistance and compatibility among thermoplastic materials. PVDF is considered to have excellent / inert resistance to:
Key: 1—Resistant, 2—Limited resistant, 3—Not resistant

=== Chemical sensitivity ===
PVDF, similar to other fluoropolymers, exhibits chemical sensitivity, in general, with the following chemical families:
* strong bases, caustics,
* esters,
* ketones.

=== Intrinsic properties and resistance ===
Polyvinylidene fluoride expresses inherent resistance characteristics in certain high-focus applications. Namely these are: ozone oxidation reactions, nuclear radiation, UV damage, and microbiological, fungus growth. PVDF&#x27;s resistance to these conditions is fairly distinctive among thermoplastic materials. PVDF&#x27;s carbon and fluoride elemental stability contributes to this resistance, as well as the polymeric integration of PVDF during its processing.

==Processing==
PVDF may be synthesized from the gaseous vinylidene fluoride (VDF) monomer by a free-radical (or controlled-radical) polymerization process. This may be followed by processes such as melt casting, or processing from a solution (e.g. solution casting, spin coating, and film casting). Langmuir–Blodgett films have also been made. In the case of solution-based processing, typical solvents used include dimethylformamide and the more volatile butanone. In aqueous emulsion polymerization, the fluorosurfactant perfluorononanoic acid is used in anion form as a processing aid by solubilizing monomers. Compared to other fluoropolymers, it has an easier melt process because of its relatively low melting point of around 177 °C.

Processed materials are typically in the non-piezoelectric alpha phase. The material must either be stretched or annealed to obtain the piezoelectric beta phase. The exception to this is for PVDF thin films (thickness in the order of micrometres). Residual stresses between thin films and the substrates on which they are processed are great enough to cause the beta phase to form.

In order to obtain a piezoelectric response, the material must first be poled in a large electric field. Poling of the material typically requires an external field of above 30 megavolts per metre (MV/m). Thick films (typically &gt;100 μm) must be heated during the poling process in order to achieve a large piezoelectric response. Thick films are usually heated to 70–100 °C during the poling process.

A quantitative defluorination process was described by mechanochemistry, for safe eco-friendly PVDF waste processing.

==Applications==

PVDF is a thermoplastic that expresses versatility for applications similar to other thermoplastics, particularly fluoropolymers. PVDF resin is heated and handled for use in extrusion and injection molding to produce PVDF pipes, sheets, coatings, films, and molded PVDF products, such as bulk containers. Common industry applications for PVDF thermoplastics include:
* chemical processing,
* electricity, batteries and electronic components,
* construction and architecture,
* healthcare and pharmaceutics,
* biomedical research,
* ultra-pure applications,
* nuclear waste handling,
* petrochemical, oil and gas,
* food, beverage processing,
* water, wastewater management.

=== In electronics / electricity ===
PVDF is commonly used as insulation on electrical wires, because of its combination of flexibility, low weight, low thermal conductivity, high chemical corrosion resistance, and heat resistance. Most of the narrow 30-gauge wire used in wire wrap circuit assembly and printed circuit board rework is PVDF-insulated. In this use the wire is generally referred to as &quot;Kynar wire&quot;, from the trade name.

The piezoelectric properties of PVDF are exploited in the manufacture of tactile sensor arrays, inexpensive strain gauges, and lightweight audio transducers. Piezoelectric panels made of PVDF are used on the Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter, a scientific instrument of the New Horizons space probe that measures dust density in the outer Solar System.

PVDF is the standard binder material used in the production of composite electrodes for lithium-ion batteries. Solution of PVDF by mass in &quot;N&quot;-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) is mixed with an active lithium storage material such as graphite, silicon, tin, LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, or LiFePO4 and a conductive additive such as carbon black or carbon nanofibers. This slurry is cast onto a metallic current collector, and the NMP is evaporated to form a composite or paste electrode. PVDF is used because it is chemically inert over the potential range used and does not react with the electrolyte or lithium.

=== In biomedical science ===
In the biomedical sciences, PVDF is used in immunoblotting as an artificial membrane (usually with 0.22 or 0.45-micrometre pore sizes), on which proteins are transferred using electricity (see western blotting). PVDF is resistant to solvents and, therefore, these membranes can be easily stripped and reused to look at other proteins. PVDF membranes may be used in other biomedical applications as part of a membrane filtration device, often in the form of a syringe filter or wheel filter. The various properties of this material, such as heat resistance, resistance to chemical corrosion, and low protein binding properties, make this material valuable in the biomedical sciences for preparation of medications as a sterilizing filter, and as a filter to prepare samples for analytical techniques such as high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), where small amounts of particulate matter can damage sensitive and expensive equipment.

PVDF transducers have the advantage of being dynamically more suitable for modal testing than semiconductor piezoresistive transducers and more compliant for structural integration than piezoceramic transducers. For those reasons, the use of PVDF active sensors is a keystone for the development of future structural-health monitoring methods, due to their low cost and compliance.

=== In high-temperature processes ===
PVDF is used as piping, sheet, and internal coatings in high-temperature, hot acid, radiation environment applications due to PVDF&#x27;s resistance characteristics and upper temperature thresholds. As piping, PVDF is rated up to 248 °F (120 °C). Examples of PVDF uses include nuclear reactor waste handling, chemical synthesis and production, (sulfuric acid, common), air plenums, and boiler service pipe.

=== Other uses ===
PVDF is used for specialty monofilament fishing lines, sold as fluorocarbon replacements for nylon monofilament. The surface is harder, so it is more resistant to abrasion and sharp fish teeth. Its refractive index is lower than nylon, which makes the line less discernible to fish eyes. It is also denser than nylon, making it sink faster towards fish.

==Other forms==
===Copolymers===
The copolymer Poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) or PVDF-HFP is used as a co-polymer in the blades of artificial turf. Addition of organoclay to PVDF-HFP via melt compounding stabilizes the β piezoelectric phase.

Copolymers of PVDF are also used in piezoelectric and electrostrictive applications. One of the most commonly used copolymers is P(VDF-trifluoroethylene), usually available in ratios of about 50:50 and 65:35 by mass (equivalent to about 56:44 and 70:30 molar fractions). Another one is P(VDF-tetrafluoroethylene). They improve the piezoelectric response by improving the crystallinity of the material.

While the copolymers&#x27; unit structures are less polar than that of pure PVDF, the copolymers typically have a much higher crystallinity. This results in a larger piezoelectric response: d33 values for P(VDF-TFE) have been recorded to be as high as −38 p C/N compared to −33 pC/N in pure PVDF.

===Terpolymers===
Terpolymers of PVDF are the most promising one in terms of electromechanically induced strain. The most commonly used PVDF-based terpolymers are P(VDF-TrFE-CTFE) and P(VDF-TrFE-CFE). This relaxor-based ferroelectric terpolymer is produced by random incorporation of the bulky third monomer (chlorotrifluoroethylene, CTFE) into the polymer chain of P(VDF-TrFE) copolymer (which is ferroelectric in nature). This random incorporation of CTFE in P(VDF-TrFE) copolymer disrupts the long-range ordering of the ferroelectric polar phase, resulting in the formation of nano-polar domains. When an electric field is applied, the disordered nano-polar domains change their conformation to all-trans conformation, which leads to large electrostrictive strain and a high room-temperature dielectric constant of ~50.

== Safety and regulations ==

PVDF is widely considered safe and ubiquitous used for water treatment, the food industry, and biocompatible devices like hernia meshes or internal devices. PVDF differs from PFAS in that alternating groups are hydrogen, making it less resilient to high temperatures, but also meaning that byproducts don&#x27;t degrade into known hazardous PFAS. However, studies examining ecotoxity have shown that very high concentrations (up to 100 mg/L) may alter jellyfish behavior, while not being toxic to them. In the US, FDA regulations consider PVDF to be food safe, while US EPA water treatment regulations on PFAS have avoided placing limits on PVDF, while strictly limit concentrations of PFAS.

PVDF was added to the Living Building Challenge (LBC) Red List in 2022. The Red List bans substances prevalent in the building industry that pose serious risks to human health and the environment from construction that seeks to meet the criteria of the Living Building Challenge (LBC).

Proposed regulations in the EU aim to ban &quot;any substance that contains at least one fully fluorinated methyl (CF3) or methylene (CF2-) carbon atom (without any H/Cl/Br/I attached to it)”. Unless exemptions are made, the application of inconsistent and severe regulations may propose an existential risk to the industry.
