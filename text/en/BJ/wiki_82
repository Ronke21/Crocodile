<text>Electronic voting is voting that uses electronic means to either aid or take care of casting and counting ballots including voting time.

Depending on the particular implementation, e-voting may use standalone &quot;electronic voting machines&quot; (also called EVM) or computers connected to the Internet (online voting). It may encompass a range of Internet services, from basic transmission of tabulated results to full-function online voting through common connectable household devices. The degree of automation may be limited to marking a paper ballot, or may be a comprehensive system of vote input, vote recording, data encryption and transmission to servers, and consolidation and tabulation of election results.

A worthy e-voting system must perform most of these tasks while complying with a set of standards established by regulatory bodies, and must also be capable to deal successfully with strong requirements associated with security, accuracy, speed, privacy, auditability, accessibility, data integrity, cost-effectiveness, scalability, anonymity, trustworthiness, and sustainability.

Electronic voting technology can include punched cards, optical scan voting systems and specialized voting kiosks (including self-contained direct-recording electronic voting systems, or DRE). It can also involve transmission of ballots and votes via telephones, private computer networks, or the Internet. The functions of electronic voting depends primarily on what the organizers intent to achieve.

In general, two main types of e-voting can be identified:

* e-voting which is physically supervised by representatives of governmental or independent electoral authorities (e.g. electronic voting machines located at polling stations);
* remote e-voting via the Internet (also called i-voting) where the voter submits his or her vote electronically to the election authorities, from any location.

Many countries have used electronic voting for at least some elections, including Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Kazakhstan, South Korea, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States. , Brazil is the only country in which all elections are conducted through electronic voting.

==Benefits==
Electronic voting technology intends to speed the counting of ballots, reduce the cost of paying staff to count votes manually and can provide improved accessibility for disabled voters. Also in the long term, expenses are expected to decrease.
Results can be reported and published faster.
Voters save time and cost by being able to vote independently from their location. This may increase overall voter turnout. The citizen groups benefiting most from electronic elections are the ones living abroad, citizens living in rural areas far away from polling stations and the disabled with mobility impairments.

==Concerns and improvements==

In a 2004 article for OpenDemocracy, security analyst Bruce Schneier claimed that computer security experts at the time were &quot;unanimous on what to do&quot; about concerns regarding electronic voting. &quot;DRE machines must have voter-verifiable paper audit trails,&quot; he said, and &quot;software used on DRE machines must be open to public scrutiny&quot; to ensure the accuracy of the voting system. Verifiable ballots are necessary because computers can and do malfunction and because voting machines can be compromised.

Concerns regarding security lapses in aging voting machines came to a head shortly before and during the 2016 United States presidential election. Cases were reported at the time of machines making unpredictable, inconsistent errors. The expert consensus centered on three primary solutions: the openness of a system to public examination from outside experts, the creation of an authenticable paper record of votes cast, and a chain of custody for records.

Several major reforms took place after the 2016 U.S. election, including the widespread adoption of voting machines that produce voter-verified paper audit trails (VVPATs). These paper records allow election officials to conduct audits and recounts, significantly enhancing transparency and security. Congress provided $380 million in funding through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 under the framework of the Help America Vote Act to replace old machines with more secure models with modern cybersecurity protections. By 2020, 93% of U.S. votes had a paper record, and only 0.5 percent of jurisdictions reported using electronic voting machines without paper audit trails. This reduced the risk of undetected cyber interference or machine malfunction by enabling verification through physical ballots.

In collaboration with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and other organizations, election officials also took steps to harden voting systems against potential cyberattacks. This included training election officials, sharing threat intelligence, and establishing secure systems for vote transmission and counting.

In addition to concerns about electoral fraud and auditability, electronic voting has been criticized as unnecessary and expensive to introduce. While countries like India continue to use electronic voting, several countries have cancelled e-voting systems or decided against a large-scale rollout, notably the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany and the United Kingdom due to issues in reliability or transparency of EVMs.

Moreover, people without internet or the skills to use it are excluded from the service. The so-called digital divide describes the gap between those who have access to the internet and those who do not. Depending on the country or even regions in a country the gap differs. This concern is expected to become less important in future since the number of internet users tends to increase.

Expenses for the installation of an electronic voting system are high. For some governments they may be too high so that they do not invest. This aspect is even more important if it is not sure whether electronic voting is a long-term solution.

===New South Wales 2021 iVote failures===
During the 2021 NSW Local Government Elections the online voting system &quot;iVote&quot; had technical issues that caused some access problems for some voters. Analysis done of these failures indicated a significant chance of the outages having impacted on the electoral results for the final positions. In the Kempsey ward, where the margin between the last elected and first non-elected candidates was only 69 votes, the electoral commission determined that the outage caused a 60% chance that the wrong final candidate was elected. Singleton had a 40% chance of having elected the wrong councillor, Shellharbour was a 7% chance and two other races were impacted by a sub-1% chance of having elected the wrong candidate. The NSW Supreme Court ordered the elections in Kempsey, Singleton and Shellharbour Ward A to be re-run. In the 2022 Kempsey re-vote the highest placed non-elected candidate from 2021, Dean Saul, was instead one of the first councillors elected. This failure caused the NSW Government to suspend the iVote system from use in the 2023 New South Wales state election.

==Types of system==

===Electronic voting machines===
Electronic voting systems for electorates have been in use since the 1960s when punched card systems debuted. Their first widespread use was in the US where 7 counties switched to this method for the 1964 presidential election. The newer optical scan voting systems allow a computer to count a voter&#x27;s mark on a ballot. DRE voting machines which collect and tabulate votes in a single machine, are used by all voters in all elections in Brazil and India, and also on a large scale in Venezuela and the United States. They have been used on a large scale in the Netherlands but have been decommissioned after public concerns. In Brazil, the use of DRE voting machines has been associated with a decrease in error-ridden and uncounted votes, promoting a larger enfranchisement of mainly less educated people in the electoral process, shifting government spending toward public healthcare, particularly beneficial to the poor.

====Paper-based electronic voting system====

Paper-based voting systems originated as a system where votes are cast and counted by hand, using paper ballots. With the advent of electronic tabulation came systems where paper cards or sheets could be marked by hand, but counted electronically. These systems included punched card voting, marksense and later digital pen voting systems.

These systems can include a ballot marking device or electronic ballot marker that allows voters to make their selections using an electronic input device, usually a touch screen system similar to a DRE. Systems including a ballot marking device can incorporate different forms of assistive technology. In 2004, Open Voting Consortium demonstrated the &#x27;Dechert Design&#x27;, a General Public License open source paper ballot printing system with open source bar codes on each ballot.

====Direct-recording electronic (DRE) voting system====

A direct-recording electronic (DRE) voting machine records votes by means of a ballot display provided with mechanical or electro-optical components that can be activated by the voter (typically buttons or a touchscreen); that processes data with computer software; and that records voting data and ballot images in memory components. After the election it produces a tabulation of the voting data stored in a removable memory component and as a printed copy. The system may also provide a means for transmitting individual ballots or vote totals to a central location for consolidating and reporting results from precincts at the central location. These systems use a precinct count method that tabulates ballots at the polling place. They typically tabulate ballots as they are cast and print the results after the close of polling.

In 2002, in the United States, the Help America Vote Act mandated that one handicapped accessible voting system be provided per polling place, which most jurisdictions have chosen to satisfy with the use of DRE voting machines, some switching entirely over to DRE. In 2004, 28.9% of the registered voters in the United States used some type of direct recording electronic voting system, up from 7.7% in 1996.
In 2004, India adopted Electronic Voting Machines (EVM) for its elections to its parliament with 380 million voters casting their ballots using more than one million voting machines. The Indian EVMs are designed and developed by two government-owned defence equipment manufacturing units, Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL). Both systems are identical, and are developed to the specifications of Election Commission of India. The system is a set of two devices running on 7.5 volt batteries. One device, the voting Unit is used by the voter, and another device called the control unit is operated by the electoral officer. Both units are connected by a five-metre cable. The voting unit has a blue button for each candidate. The unit can hold 16 candidates, but up to four units can be chained, to accommodate 64 candidates. The control unit has three buttons on the surface – one button to release a single vote, one button to see the total number of votes cast till now, and one button to close the election process. The result button is hidden and sealed. It cannot be pressed unless the close button has already been pressed. A controversy was raised when the voting machine malfunctioned which was shown in Delhi assembly. On 9 April 2019, the Supreme Court ordered the ECI to increase voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT) slips vote count to five randomly selected EVMs per assembly constituency, which means ECI has to count VVPAT slips of 20,625 EVMs before it certifies the final election results.

=====Public network DRE voting system=====
A public network DRE voting system is an election system that uses electronic ballots and transmits vote data from the polling place to another location over a public network. Vote data may be transmitted as individual ballots as they are cast, periodically as batches of ballots throughout the election day, or as one batch at the close of voting. 
Public network DRE voting system can utilize either precinct count or central count method. The central count method tabulates ballots from multiple precincts at a central location.

===Online voting===

Internet voting systems have gained popularity and have been used for government and membership organization elections and referendums in Estonia, and Switzerland as well as municipal elections in Canada and party primary elections in the United States and France. Internet voting has also been widely used in sub-national participatory budgeting processes, including in Brazil, France, United States, Portugal and Spain.

Security experts have found security problems in every attempt at online voting, including systems in Australia, Estonia, Switzerland, Russia, and the United States.

It has been argued political parties that have more support from less-wealthy voters—who tend to have less access to and familiarity with the Internet—may suffer in the elections due to e-voting, which tends to increase participation among wealthier voters. It is unsure as to whether narrowing the digital divide would promote equal voting opportunities for people across various social, economic, and ethnic backgrounds.

The effects of internet voting on overall voter turnout are unclear. A 2017 study of online voting in two Swiss cantons found that it had no effect on turnout, and a 2009 study of Estonia&#x27;s national election found similar results. To the contrary, however, the introduction of online voting in municipal elections in the Canadian province of Ontario resulted in an average increase in turnout of around 3.5 percentage points. Similarly, a further study of the Swiss case found that while online voting did not increase overall turnout, it did induce some occasional voters to participate who would have abstained were online voting not an option.

A paper on “remote electronic voting and turnout in the Estonian 2007 parliamentary elections” showed that rather than eliminating inequalities, e-voting might have enhanced the digital divide between higher and lower socioeconomic classes. People who lived greater distances from polling areas voted at higher levels with this service now available. The 2007 Estonian elections yielded a higher voter turnout from those who lived in higher income regions and who received formal education. Still regarding the Estonian Internet voting system, it was proved to be more cost-efficient than the rest of the voting systems offered in 2017 local elections.
Electronic voting is perceived to be favored moreover by a certain demographic, namely the younger generation such as Generation X and Y voters. However, in recent elections about a quarter of e-votes were cast by the older demographic, such as individuals over the age of 55. Including this, about 20% of e-votes came from voters between the ages of 45 and 54. This goes to show that e-voting is not supported exclusively by the younger generations, but finding some popularity amongst Gen X and Baby Boomers as well. In terms of electoral results as well, the expectation that online voting would favor younger candidates has not been borne out in the data, with mayors in Ontario, Canada who were elected in online elections actually being slightly older on average than those elected by pencil and paper.

Online voting is widely used privately for shareholder votes, 
and other private organizations.
The election management companies do not promise accuracy or privacy.
In fact one company uses an individual&#x27;s past votes for research, and to target ads.

Corporations and organizations routinely use Internet voting to elect officers and board members and for other proxy elections. Internet voting systems have been used privately in many modern nations and publicly in the United States, the UK, Switzerland and Estonia. In Switzerland, where it is already an established part of local referendums, voters get their passwords to access the ballot through the postal service. Most voters in Estonia can cast their vote in local and parliamentary elections, if they want to, via the Internet, as most of those on the electoral roll have access to an e-voting system, the largest run by any European Union country. It has been made possible because most Estonians carry a national identity card equipped with a computer-readable microchip and it is these cards which they use to get access to the online ballot. All a voter needs is a computer, an electronic card reader, their ID card and its PIN, and they can vote from anywhere in the world. Estonian e-votes can only be cast during the days of advance voting. On election day itself people have to go to polling stations and fill in a paper ballot.

==== Sybil attacks ====

One of the biggest weaknesses of online voting is the difficulty of dealing with fake identities, especially when voting is implemented using software without the cooperation of some kind of government agency. These attacks use sybils—fake or duplicate identities—to influence community decisions. Since a single vote has the potential to tilt a group decision, prevention of sybil attacks is an important priority in ensuring the security of voting. Sybil attacks are a common issue with implementations on open, peer-to-peer networks, as the system must have a way to prevent fake identities to prevent gaming of the vote.

Some future possible avenues of inquiries include to investigate more intersectional proof of personhood systems that aren&#x27;t directly blockchain-based. For example, extending the web of trust by having a protocol that verifies proof of identities using social interactions would allow a community of users to assign corresponding levels of trusts to different candidates in relation with others. However, this would require a fully decentralized system. This web-of-trust protocol could even expand to allowing candidates to provide proof of personhood by physical attendance, which could lead to trusted clusters that grow into communities.

===Hybrid systems===
There are also hybrid systems that include an electronic ballot marking device (usually a touch screen system similar to a DRE) or other assistive technology to print a voter verified paper audit trail, then use a separate machine for electronic tabulation. Hybrid voting often includes both e-voting and mail-in paper ballots.

Internet voting can use remote locations (voting from any Internet capable computer) or can use traditional polling locations with voting booths consisting of Internet connected voting systems.

==Analysis==

Electronic voting systems may offer advantages compared to other voting techniques. An electronic voting system can be involved in any one of a number of steps in the setup, distributing, voting, collecting, and counting of ballots, and thus may or may not introduce advantages into any of these steps. Potential disadvantages exist as well including the potential for flaws or weakness in any electronic component.

Charles Stewart of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology estimates that 1 million more ballots were counted in the 2004 US presidential election than in 2000 because electronic voting machines detected votes that paper-based machines would have missed.

In May 2004 the U.S. Government Accountability Office released a report titled &quot;Electronic Voting Offers Opportunities and Presents Challenges&quot;, analyzing both the benefits and concerns created by electronic voting. A second report was released in September 2005 detailing some of the concerns with electronic voting, and ongoing improvements, titled &quot;Federal Efforts to Improve Security and Reliability of Electronic Voting Systems Are Under Way, but Key Activities Need to Be Completed&quot;.

===Electronic ballots===
Electronic voting systems may use &quot;electronic ballot&quot; to store votes in computer memory. Systems which use them exclusively are called DRE voting systems. When electronic ballots are used there is no risk of exhausting the supply of ballots. Additionally, these electronic ballots remove the need for printing of paper ballots, a significant cost. When administering elections in which ballots are offered in multiple languages (in some areas of the United States, public elections are required by the National Voting Rights Act of 1965), electronic ballots can be programmed to provide ballots in multiple languages for a single machine. The advantage with respect to ballots in different languages appears to be unique to electronic voting. For example, King County, Washington&#x27;s demographics require them under U.S. federal election law to provide ballot access in Chinese (Mandarin?). With any type of paper ballot, the county has to decide how many Chinese-language ballots to print, how many to make available at each polling place, etc. Any strategy that can assure that Chinese-language ballots will be available at all polling places is certain, at the very least, to result in a significant number of wasted ballots. (The situation with lever machines would be even worse than with paper: the only apparent way to reliably meet the need would be to set up a Chinese-language lever machine at each polling place, few of which would be used at all.)

Critics argue the need for extra ballots in any language can be mitigated by providing a process to print ballots at voting locations. They argue further, the cost of software validation, compiler trust validation, installation validation, delivery validation and validation of other steps related to electronic voting is complex and expensive, thus electronic ballots are not guaranteed to be less costly than printed ballots.

===Accessibility===

Electronic voting machines can be made fully accessible for persons with disabilities. Punched card and optical scan machines are not fully accessible for the blind or visually impaired, and lever machines can be difficult for voters with limited mobility and strength. Electronic machines can use headphones, sip and puff, foot pedals, joy sticks and other adaptive technology to provide the necessary accessibility.

Organizations such as the Verified Voting Foundation have criticized the accessibility of electronic voting machines and advocate alternatives. Some disabled voters (including the visually impaired) could use a tactile ballot, a ballot system using physical markers to indicate where a mark should be made, to vote a secret paper ballot. These ballots can be designed identically to those used by other voters. However, other disabled voters (including voters with dexterity disabilities) could be unable to use these ballots.

===Cryptographic verification===
The concept of election verifiability through cryptographic solutions has emerged in the academic literature to introduce transparency and trust in electronic voting systems. It allows voters and election observers to verify that votes have been recorded, tallied and declared correctly, in a manner independent from the hardware and software running the election. Three aspects of verifiability are considered: individual, universal, and eligibility. Individual verifiability allows a voter to check that her own vote is included in the election outcome, universal verifiability allows voters or election observers to check that the election outcome corresponds to the votes cast, and eligibility verifiability allows voters and observers to check that each vote in the election outcome was cast by a uniquely registered voter.

===Voter intent===
Electronic voting machines are able to provide immediate feedback to the voter detecting such possible problems as undervoting and overvoting which may result in a spoiled ballot. This immediate feedback can be helpful in successfully determining voter intent.

===Transparency===
It has been alleged by groups such as the UK-based Open Rights Group that a lack of testing, inadequate audit procedures, and insufficient attention given to system or process design with electronic voting leaves &quot;elections open to error and fraud&quot;.

In 2009, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany found that when using voting machines the &quot;verification of the result must be possible by the citizen reliably and without any specialist knowledge of the subject.&quot; The DRE Nedap-computers used till then did not fulfill that requirement. The decision did not ban electronic voting as such, but requires all essential steps in elections to be subject to public examinability.

In 2013, The California Association of Voting Officials was formed to maintain efforts toward publicly owned General Public License open source voting systems

===Coercion evidence===
In 2013, researchers from Europe proposed that the electronic voting systems should be coercion evident. There should be a public evidence of the amount of coercion that took place in a particular elections. An internet voting system called &quot;Caveat Coercitor&quot; shows how coercion evidence in voting systems can be achieved.

===Audit trails===
A fundamental challenge with any voting machine is to produce evidence that the votes were recorded as cast and tabulated as recorded. Election results produced by voting systems that rely on voter-marked paper ballots can be verified with manual hand counts (either valid sampling or full recounts). Paperless ballot voting systems must support auditability in different ways. An independently auditable system, sometimes called an Independent Verification, can be used in recounts or audits. These systems can include the ability for voters to verify how their votes were cast or enable officials to verify that votes were tabulated correctly.

A discussion draft argued by researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) states, &quot;Simply put, the DRE architecture’s inability to provide for independent audits of its electronic records makes it a poor choice for an environment in which detecting errors and fraud is important.&quot; The report does not represent the official position of NIST, and misinterpretations of the report has led NIST to explain that &quot;Some statements in the report have been misinterpreted. The draft report includes statements from election officials, voting system vendors, computer scientists and other experts in the field about what is potentially possible in terms of attacks on DREs. However, these statements are not report conclusions.&quot;

Various technologies can be used to assure DRE voters that their votes were cast correctly, and allow officials to detect possible fraud or malfunction, and to provide a means to audit the tabulated results. Some systems include technologies such as cryptography (visual or mathematical), paper (kept by the voter or verified and left with election officials), audio verification, and dual recording or witness systems (other than with paper).

Dr. Rebecca Mercuri, the creator of the Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) concept (as described in her Ph.D. dissertation in October 2000 on the basic voter verifiable ballot system), proposes to answer the auditability question by having the voting machine print a paper ballot or other paper facsimile that can be visually verified by the voter before being entered into a secure location. Subsequently, this is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Mercuri method.&quot; To be truly &quot;voter&quot;-verified, the record itself must be verified by the voter and able to be done without assistance, such as visually or audibly. If the voter must use a bar-code scanner or other electronic device to verify, then the record is not truly voter-verifiable, since it is actually the electronic device that is verifying the record for the voter. VVPAT is the form of Independent Verification most commonly found in elections in the United States and other countries such as Venezuela.

End-to-end auditable voting systems can provide the voter with a receipt that can be taken home. This receipt does not allow voters to prove to others how they voted, but it does allow them to verify that the system detected their vote correctly. End-to-end (E2E) systems include Punchscan, ThreeBallot and Prêt à Voter. Scantegrity is an add-on that extends current optical scan voting systems with an E2E layer. The city of Takoma Park, Maryland used Scantegrity II for its November 2009 election.

Systems that allow the voter to prove how they voted are never used in U.S. public elections, and are outlawed by most state constitutions. The primary concerns with this solution are voter intimidation and vote selling.

An audit system can be used in measured random recounts to detect possible malfunction or fraud. With the VVPAT method, the paper ballot is often treated as the official ballot of record. In this scenario, the ballot is primary and the electronic records are used only for an initial count. In any subsequent recounts or challenges, the paper, not the electronic ballot, would be used for tabulation. Whenever a paper record serves as the legal ballot, that system will be subject to the same benefits and concerns as any paper ballot system.

To successfully audit any voting machine, a strict chain of custody is required.

The solution was first demonstrated (New York City, March 2001) and used (Sacramento, California 2002) by AVANTE International Technology, Inc.. In 2004 Nevada was the first state to successfully implement a DRE voting system that printed an electronic record. The $9.3 million voting system provided by Sequoia Voting Systems included more than 2,600 AVC EDGE touchscreen DREs equipped with the VeriVote VVPAT component.
 The new systems, implemented under the direction of then Secretary of State Dean Heller replaced largely punched card voting systems and were chosen after feedback was solicited from the community through town hall meetings and input solicited from the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

===Hardware===

Inadequately secured hardware can be subject to physical tampering. Some critics, such as the group &quot;Wij vertrouwen stemcomputers niet&quot; (&quot;We do not trust voting machines&quot;), charge that, for instance, foreign hardware could be inserted into the machine, or between the user and the central mechanism of the machine itself, using a man in the middle attack technique, and thus even sealing DRE machines may not be sufficient protection. This claim is countered by the position that review and testing procedures can detect fraudulent code or hardware, if such things are present, and that a thorough, verifiable chain of custody would prevent the insertion of such hardware or software. Security seals are commonly employed in an attempt to detect tampering, but testing by Argonne National Laboratory and others demonstrates that existing seals can usually be quickly defeated by a trained person using low-tech methods.

===Software===
Security experts, such as Bruce Schneier, have demanded that voting machine source code should be publicly available for inspection. Others have also suggested publishing voting machine software under a free software license as is done in Australia.

===Testing and certification===
One method to detect errors with voting machines is parallel testing, which are conducted on the Election Day with randomly picked machines. The ACM published a study showing that, to change the outcome of the 2000 U.S. presidential election, only 2 votes in each precinct would have needed to be changed.

===Cost===
Cost of having electronic machines receive the voter&#x27;s choices, print a ballot and scan the ballots to tally results is higher than the cost of printing blank ballots, having voters mark them directly (with machine-marking only when voters want it) and scanning ballots to tally results, according to studies in Georgia, New York and Pennsylvania.

==Adoption worldwide==
==In popular culture==
In the 2006 film &quot;Man of the Year&quot; starring Robin Williams, the character played by Williams—a comedic host of political talk show—wins the election for President of the United States when a software error in the electronic voting machines produced by the fictional manufacturer Delacroy causes votes to be tallied inaccurately.

In &quot;Runoff&quot;, a 2007 novel by Mark Coggins, a surprising showing by the Green Party candidate in a San Francisco Mayoral election forces a runoff between him and the highly favored establishment candidate—a plot line that closely parallels the actual results of the 2003 election. When the private-eye protagonist of the book investigates at the behest of a powerful Chinatown businesswoman, he determines that the outcome was rigged by someone who defeated the security on the city&#x27;s newly installed e-voting system.

&quot;Hacking Democracy&quot; is a 2006 documentary film shown on HBO. Filmed over three years, it documents American citizens investigating anomalies and irregularities with electronic voting systems that occurred during America&#x27;s 2000 and 2004 elections, especially in Volusia County, Florida. The film investigates the flawed integrity of electronic voting machines, particularly those made by Diebold Election Systems and culminates in the hacking of a Diebold election system in Leon County, Florida.

The central conflict in the MMO video game Infantry resulted from the global institution of direct democracy through the use of personal voting devices sometime in the 22nd century AD. The practice gave rise to a &#x27;voting class&#x27; of citizens composed mostly of homemakers and retirees who tended to be at home all day. Because they had the most free time to participate in voting, their opinions ultimately came to dominate politics.

<text>Afar (; also known as ’Afar af, Afaraf, Qafar af) is an Afroasiatic language belonging to the Cushitic branch. It is spoken by the Afar people inhabiting Djibouti, Eritrea and Ethiopia.

==Classification==
Afar is classified within the Cushitic branch of the Afroasiatic family. It is further categorized in the Lowland East Cushitic sub-group, along with Saho and Somali. Its closest relative is the Saho language.

==Geographic distribution==
The Afar language is spoken as a mother tongue by the Afar people in Djibouti, Eritrea, and the Afar Region of Ethiopia.

According to &quot;Ethnologue&quot;, there are total Afar speakers. Of these, 1,280,000 were recorded in the 2007 Ethiopian census, with 906,000 monolinguals registered in the 1994 census.

==Official status==
In Djibouti, Afar is a recognized national language. It is also one of the broadcasting languages of the Radio Television of Djibouti public network.

In Eritrea, Afar is recognized as one of nine national languages which formally enjoy equal status although Tigrinya and Arabic are by far of greatest significance in official usage. There are daily broadcasts on the national radio and a translated version of the Eritrean constitution. In education, however, Afar speakers prefer Arabic – which many of them speak as a second language – as the language of instruction.

In the Afar Region of Ethiopia, Afar is also recognized as an official working language. Since 2020, Afar is one of the five official working languages of Ethiopia.

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
The consonants of the Afar language in the standard orthography are listed below in angle brackets (preceded by the IPA notation):

Voiceless stop consonants which close syllables are released, e.g., .

===Vowels and stress===
Sentence final vowels of affirmative verbs are aspirated (and stressed), e.g.
* = &#x27;He did.&#x27;
Sentence final vowels of negative verbs are not aspirated (nor stressed), e.g.
* = &#x27;He did not do.&#x27;
Sentence final vowels of interrogative verbs are lengthened (and stressed), e.g.
* = &#x27;Did he do?&#x27;
Otherwise, stress in word-final.

===Phonotactics===
Possible syllable shapes are V, VV, VC, VVC, CV, CVV and CVVC.

==Syntax==
As in most other Cushitic languages, the basic word order in Afar is subject–object–verb.

==Writing system==
In Ethiopia, Afar used to be written with the Ge&#x27;ez script (Ethiopic script). Since around 1849, the Latin script has been used in other areas to transcribe the language. Additionally, Afar is also transcribed using the Arabic script.

In the early 1970s, two Afar intellectuals and nationalists, Dimis and Redo, formalized the Afar alphabet. Known as &quot;Qafar Feera&quot;, the orthography is based on the Latin script.

Officials from the Institut des Langues de Djibouti, the Eritrean Ministry of Education, and the Ethiopian Afar Language Studies and Enrichment Center have since worked with Afar linguists, authors and community representatives to select a standard orthography for Afar from among the various existing writing systems used to transcribe the language.

<text>The Province of Prussia (; ; ; ) was a province of the Kingdom of Prussia from 1824 to 1878. The province was established in 1824 from the provinces of East Prussia and West Prussia, and was dissolved in 1878 when the merger was reversed.

Königsberg (present-day Kaliningrad, Russia) was the provincial capital.

==History==
Ducal Prussia became part of Brandenburg-Prussia in 1618, and became the Kingdom of Prussia upon Frederick I of Prussia&#x27;s coronation as king in 1701. After the coronation, the term &quot;Province of Prussia&quot; was used to designate East Prussia to differentiate the former duchy&#x27;s territory within the larger kingdom. Royal Prussia (consisting of the Malbork Land and Warmia which were parts of historical Prussia, but also of historically Polish Pomerelia) was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1772 during the First Partition of Poland, placing them under Prussian rule under the name West Prussia, with the exception of Warmia integrated into East Prussia.

The Province of Prussia was created on 13 April 1824 as the easternmost province of the Kingdom of Prussia. The province was formed in a merger with the pre-existing provinces of East Prussia and West Prussia joined together in a personal union and, from 3 December 1829, in a real union. Its territory included the entire historical region of Prussia, from which the province and the kingdom derived their names, as well as Pomerelia and (following the Congress of Vienna) parts of Greater Poland. On 1 April 1878 the Province of Prussia was divided back into the provinces of West Prussia and East Prussia.

<text>Dzongkha (; ) is a Tibeto-Burman language that is the official and national language of Bhutan. It is written using the Tibetan script.

The word means &quot;the language of the fortress&quot;, from &#x27; &quot;fortress&quot; and&#x27; &quot;language&quot;. , Dzongkha had 171,080 native speakers and about 640,000 total speakers.

Dzongkha is a South Tibetic language. It is closely related to Laya and Lunana and partially intelligible with Sikkimese, and to some other Bhutanese languages such as Chocha Ngacha, Brokpa, Brokkat and Lakha. It has a more distant relationship to Standard Tibetan. Spoken Dzongkha and Tibetan are around 50 to 80 percent mutually intelligible.

== Classification ==
Dzongkha is considered a South Tibetic language. It is closely related to and partially intelligible with Sikkimese, and to some other Bhutanese languages such as Chocha Ngacha, Brokpa, Brokkat and Lakha.

Dzongkha bears a close linguistic relationship to J&#x27;umowa, which is spoken in the Chumbi Valley of Southern Tibet. It has a much more distant relationship to Standard Tibetan. Spoken Dzongkha and Tibetan are around 50% to 80% mutually intelligible, with the literary forms of both highly influenced by the liturgical (clerical) Classical Tibetan language, known in Bhutan as &quot;Chöke,&quot; which has been used for centuries by Buddhist monks. Chöke was used as the language of education in Bhutan until the early 1960s when it was replaced by Dzongkha in public schools.

Although descended from Classical Tibetan, Dzongkha shows a great many irregularities in sound changes that make the official spelling and standard pronunciation more distant from each other than is the case with Standard Tibetan. &quot;Traditional orthography and modern phonology are two distinct systems operating by a distinct set of rules.&quot;

==Usage==
Dzongkha and its dialects are the native tongue of eight western districts of Bhutan (&quot;viz.&quot; Wangdue Phodrang, , Thimphu, Gasa, Paro, Ha, Dagana and Chukha). There are also some native speakers near the Indian town of Kalimpong, once part of Bhutan but now in North Bengal, and in Sikkim.

Dzongkha was declared the national language of Bhutan in 1971. Dzongkha study is mandatory in all schools, and the language is the &quot;lingua franca&quot; in the districts to the south and east where it is not the mother tongue. The Bhutanese films &quot;Travellers and Magicians&quot; (2003) and &quot;&quot; (2019) are in Dzongkha.

==Phonology==
=== Tones ===
Dzongkha is a tonal language and has two register tones: high and low. The tone of a syllable determines the allophone of the onset and the phonation type of the nuclear vowel.

=== Consonants ===
All consonants may begin a syllable. In the onsets of low-tone syllables, consonants are voiced. Aspirated consonants (indicated by the superscript &quot;h&quot;), , and are not found in low-tone syllables. The rhotic is usually a trill or a fricative trill , and is voiceless in the onsets of high-tone syllables.

 are dental. Descriptions of the palatal affricates and fricatives vary from alveolo-palatal to plain palatal.

Only a few consonants are found in syllable-final positions. Most common among them are . Syllable-final is often elided and results in the preceding vowel nasalized and prolonged, especially word-finally. Syllable-final is most often omitted when word-final as well, unless in formal speech. In literary pronunciation, liquids and may also end a syllable. Though rare, is also found in syllable-final positions. No other consonants are found in syllable-final positions.

=== Vowels ===
* When in low tone, vowels are produced with breathy voice.
* In closed syllables, varies between and , the latter being more common.
* varies between and .
* varies between close-mid and open-mid , the latter being common in closed syllables. is close-mid . may not be longer than at all, and differs from more often in quality than in length.
* Descriptions of vary between close-mid and open-mid .
* is close-mid , but may approach open-mid especially in closed syllables. is close-mid .
* is slightly lower than open-mid, i.e. .
* may approach , especially in closed syllables.
* When nasalized or followed by , vowels are always long.

=== Phonotactics ===
Many words in Dzongkha are monosyllabic. Syllables usually take the form of CVC, CV, or VC. Syllables with complex onsets are also found, but such an onset must be a combination of an unaspirated bilabial stop and a palatal affricate. The bilabial stops in complex onsets are often omitted in colloquial speech.

==Writing system==

The Tibetan script used to write Dzongkha has thirty basic letters, sometimes known as &quot;radicals&quot;, for consonants. Dzongkha is usually written in Bhutanese forms of the Uchen script, forms of the Tibetan script known as &quot;Jôyi&quot; &quot;cursive longhand&quot; and &quot;Jôtshum&quot; &quot;formal longhand&quot;. The print form is known simply as &quot;Tshûm&quot;.

===Romanization===
There are various systems of romanization and transliteration for Dzongkha, but none accurately represents its phonetic sound. The Bhutanese government adopted a transcription system known as Roman Dzongkha, devised by the linguist George van Driem, as its standard in 1991.

== Grammar ==
===Nouns===

====Number====
Dzongkha nouns distinguish between singular (unmarked) and plural, with the plural either unmarked or suffixed with . The use of the plural suffix is not obligatory and is used mainly for emphasis.

====Case====
Dzongkha nouns are marked for 5 cases: genitive, locative, ablative, dative and ergative.

* genitive case: marks possession and is often translated as &quot;of&quot;. There are 4 genitive suffixes in written Dzongkha:
** - after words ending in , , , .
** - after words ending in , and certain words ending a vowel.
** - ater words ending in , , .
** after certain words ending in a vowel.
* locative case - marks location or destination and is often translated as &quot;in&quot;, &quot;at&quot; or &quot;on&quot;. It&#x27;s indicated by the suffix .
* ablative case - marks direction away from the noun and is often translated as &quot;from&quot;. It&#x27;s indicated by the suffix .
* dative case - marks the goal or where an activity takes place and is often translated as &quot;to&quot;, &quot;for&quot; or &quot;at&quot;. It&#x27;s indicated by the suffix .
* ergative case - used for ergative and instrumental functions. There are 3 ergative suffixes in written Dzongkha:
** - after words ending in , , , .
** - after words ending in , or a vowel.
** - ater words ending in , , .

====Derivation====
As in other Tibetic languages, compounding is the most common method for deriving new nouns in Dzongkha. A compound usually consists of two (or, less commonly, more) monossyllabic roots, which can be either free or bound.

===Pronouns===
==== Personal pronouns ====
* The honorific pronoun and its plural form are used when one wants to show respect to the person being addressed or to a 3rd person of either gender.

===Verbs===
====Copula====
In Dzongkha, there are 5 copular verbs that can be translated as &quot;to be&quot; in English: , , , and .

===Adjectives===
====Comparison====
The comparative is indicated by the suffix (&quot;than&quot;) while the superlative is indicated by the suffix (&quot;the most&quot;, &quot;-est&quot;).

<text>German New Guinea () consisted of the northeastern part of the island of New Guinea and several nearby island groups and was the first part of the German colonial empire. The mainland part of the territory, called , became a German protectorate in 1884. Other island groups were added subsequently. The Bismarck Archipelago (New Britain, New Ireland and several smaller islands), and the North Solomon Islands were declared a German protectorate in 1885. The Caroline Islands, Palau, and the Mariana Islands (except for Guam) were bought from Spain in 1899. German New Guinea annexed the formerly separate German Protectorate of Marshall Islands, which also included Nauru, in 1906. German Samoa, though part of the German colonial empire, was not part of German New Guinea.

Following the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Kaiser-Wilhelmsland and nearby islands fell to Australian forces, while Japan occupied most of the remaining German possessions in the Pacific. The mainland part of German New Guinea (), the Bismarck Archipelago and the North Solomon Islands are now part of Papua New Guinea. The Northern Mariana Islands are an unincorporated territory of the United States. The Carolines (as the Federated States of Micronesia), the Marshall Islands, Nauru and Palau are independent countries.

The islands to the east of Kaiser-Wilhelmsland, on annexation, were renamed the Bismarck Archipelago (formerly the New Britannia Archipelago) and the two largest islands renamed (&#x27;New Pomerania&#x27;, today&#x27;s New Britain) and (&#x27;New Mecklenburg&#x27;, now New Ireland). Due to their accessibility by water, however, these outlying islands were, and have remained, the most economically viable part of the territory.

With the exception of German Samoa, the German islands in the Western Pacific formed the &quot;Imperial German Pacific Protectorates&quot;. These were administered as part of German New Guinea and included the Bismarck Archipelago (New Britain, New Ireland, and several smaller islands), the North Solomon Islands (Buka, Bougainville, and several smaller islands), the Carolines, Palau, the Marianas (except for Guam), the Marshall Islands, and Nauru. The total land area of German New Guinea was .

== History ==
===Early German South Pacific presence===
The first Germans in the South Pacific were probably sailors on the crew of ships of the Dutch East India Company: during Abel Tasman&#x27;s first voyage, the captain of the &quot;Heemskerck&quot; was one Holleman (or Holman), born in Jever in northwest Germany.

Hanseatic League merchant houses were the first to establish footholds in the South Pacific: Johann Cesar Godeffroy &amp; Sohn of Hamburg, headquartered at Samoa from 1857, operated a South Seas network of trading stations especially dominating the copra trade and carrying German immigrants to various South Pacific settlements; in 1877 another Hamburg firm, Hernsheim and Robertson, established a German community on Matupi Island, in Blanche Bay (the north-east coast of New Britain) from which it traded in New Britain, the Caroline, and the Marshall Islands. By the end of 1875, one German trader reported: &quot;German trade and German ships are encountered everywhere, almost at the exclusion of any other nation&quot;.

===German colonial policy under Bismarck===
In the late 1870s and early 1880s, an active minority, stemming mainly from a right-wing National Liberal and Free Conservative background, had organised various colonial societies all over Germany to persuade Chancellor Bismarck to embark on a colonial policy. The most important ones were the &quot;Kolonialverein&quot; of 1882 and the Society for German Colonization (&quot;Gesellschaft für Deutsche Kolonisation&quot;) founded in 1884. The reasons for Bismarck&#x27;s lack of enthusiasm when it came to the subject of Germany&#x27;s colonial possessions is reflected in his curt response in 1888 to the procolonial, expansionist remarks of Eugen Wolf, reflected in the latter&#x27;s autobiography. After Bismarck had patiently listened to Wolf enthusiastically laying out his plans that he sought to pitch employing several illustrative maps, Bismarck finally interrupted his monologue:

Despite his personal objections, it was Bismarck himself who eventually organised the acquisition of much of what would become the German colonial empire. The first attempts at the new policy came in 1884 when Bismarck had to put German trading interests in southwestern Africa under imperial protection. Bismarck told the Reichstag on 23 June 1884 of the change in German colonial policy: annexations would now proceed but by grants of charters to private companies.

===Australian aspiration and British uninterest===
The edition of 27 November 1882 of the &quot;Augsburger Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; carried an article which the Colonial Secretary of the British colony of New South Wales drew to the attention of the editor of the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; and, on 7 February 1883, the paper published a summary of the article under the heading &quot;German annexation of New Guinea&quot;. The argument lifted from the German paper began by stating that New Guinea fell into the Australian sphere but had been neglected; although the Portuguese had explored in the 16th century, it was the Dutch from the 17th century &quot;who seemed better satisfied with the country than other European nations had been&quot; but they had over-reached themselves and had fallen back towards Java, Sumatra and Celebes. Recent explorations had given the basis for reconsideration: it &quot;is considered useful by geology and biology people as holding in its forests the key to solve problems... a profitable field for cultivation&quot; but London had only sent missionaries to save souls. &quot;As we Germans have learnt a little about conducting colonial policy, and as our wishes and plans turn with a certain vivacity towards New Guinea... according to our opinion it might be possible to create out of the island a German Java, a great trade and plantation colony, which would form a stately foundation stone for a German colonial kingdom of the future.&quot;

The publication of the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; article caused a sensation and not just in the colony of New South Wales: over the border, in the British colony of Queensland where the shipping lanes of the Torres Strait and the beche-de-mer trade were of commercial significance. The Queensland Premier, Sir Thomas McIlwraith who led a political party &quot;considered to represent the interests of the plantation owners in Queensland&quot;, drew it to the attention of the Queensland governor together with the general situation in New Guinea and urged annexation of the island. He also instructed the London Agent for Queensland to urge the Imperial Colonial Office to an act of annexation.

&quot;Impatient with the lack of results from this procedure&quot; Premier McIlwraith on his own authority ordered a Queensland Police Magistrate in March 1883 to proclaim the annexation on behalf of the Queensland government of New Guinea east of the Dutch boundary at 141E. When news of this reached London, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Derby promptly repudiated the act. When the matter came before Parliament, Lord Derby advised that the British Imperial Government “were not ready to annex New Guinea in view of its vast size and unknown interior, the certainty of native objections and administrative expense”.

===German New Guinea Company===
On his return to Germany from his 1879–1882 Pacific expedition, Otto Finsch joined a small, informal group interested in German colonial expansion into the South Seas led by the banker, Adolph von Hansemann. Finsch encouraged them to pursue the founding of a colony on the north-east coast of New Guinea and the New Britain Archipelago even providing them with an estimate of the costs of such a venture.

In 1884, the New Guinea Company was founded in Berlin by Adolph von Hansemann and a syndicate of German bankers for the purpose of colonizing and exploiting resources on &quot;Neuguinea&quot; (German New Guinea). On 3 November 1884, under the auspices of the &quot;Deutsche Neuguinea-Compagnie&quot; (New Guinea Company), the German flag was flown over Kaiser-Wilhelmsland, the Bismarck Archipelago and the German Solomon Islands. 

Albert Hahl (1868–1945) joined the German Colonial Office in 1895 and until 1914 played a major part in New Guinea&#x27;s administration. He was an imperial judge at Herbertshöhe (1896–98), deputy governor of New Guinea (1899–1901), and governor (1902–14). As a judge he made three reforms: the appointment of &#x27;luluais&#x27; [village chiefs], attempts to integrate the Tolais people into the European economy, and the protection of village lands, which led him to recommend the ending of all alienation of indigenous land. After 1901 Hahl attempted to apply his system to the whole of New Guinea, and although his success was limited, exports rose from one million marks in 1902 to eight million in 1914. He was forced to retire because of disagreements with Berlin officials, and became an active writer on New Guinea and was a leader in German colonial societies between the wars.

===Catholic and Lutheran missions===
By the mid-1880s German church authorities had devised a definite program for missionary work in New Guinea and assigned it to the Rhenish Mission, under the direction of Friedrich Fabri (1824–91), a Lutheran. The missionaries faced extraordinary difficulties, including repeated sickness, as well as psychological and sometimes violent tensions and fights between the colonial administration and the locals. The latter, at first, rejected European customs and norms of social behaviour, with few embracing Christianity. In 1921, the Rhenish Mission territory was handed over to the United Evangelical Lutheran Church of Australia.

Missionaries sponsored by the Catholic Church in Germany had better resources and influence, and proved more successful. They put more emphasis on tradition and less on modernisation, and were more in line with the world-views and traditions of the locals. European morality and discipline were often adopted, as were notions of dignity and prestige.

===Imperial German Pacific protectorates===
By the German–Spanish Treaty of 1899, Germany bought from Spain the Caroline Islands and the Mariana Islands (excluding Guam, which had been ceded to the US after the 1898 Spanish–American War) for 25 million pesetas (equivalent to 16,600,000 goldmarks). These islands became a protectorate and were administered from German New Guinea. The Marshall Islands, which had been a German protectorate since 1885, were annexed to German New Guinea in 1906.

===Forced labour policy===
To expand the highly profitable plantations, the Germans needed more workers. The government sent military expeditions to take direct control of more areas from 1899 to 1914. Instead of voluntary recruitment it became a matter of forced mobilisation. The government enforced new laws that required the tribes to furnish four weeks of labour per person annually and payment of a poll tax in cash, thereby forcing reluctant local inhabitants into the work force. The government did explore the choice of voluntary recruitment of labourers from China, Japan, and Micronesia, but only a few hundred came. After 1910 the government tried to ameliorate the impact by ending the recruitment of women in some areas and entirely closing other areas to recruiting. The planters protested German forced labor policies vehemently and initiated what would go on to be called the Sokehs rebellion. The government responded by sending 4 warships with 745 troops to defeat the Sokehs workers and impose the forced labour policy. They arrived in January 1911 and by February 1911 the Sokehs leader had surrendered.

===World War I===

Following the outbreak of World War I, Australian troops captured Kaiser-Wilhelmsland and the nearby islands in 1914, after a short resistance led by Captain Carl von Klewitz and Lt. Robert &quot;Lord Bob&quot; von Blumenthal, while Japan occupied most of the remaining German possessions in the Pacific. The only significant battle occurred on 11 September 1914 when the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force attacked the low-power wireless station at Bita Paka (near Rabaul) on the island of New Britain, then Neu Pommern. The Australians suffered six dead and four wounded – the first Australian military casualties of the First World War. The German forces fared much worse, with one German officer and 30 local policemen killed and one German officer and ten local policemen wounded. On 21 September all German forces in the colony surrendered.
However, Lieutenant (later Hauptmann) Hermann Detzner, a German officer, and some 20 local policemen evaded capture in the interior of New Guinea for the entire war. Detzner was on a surveying expedition to map the border with Australian-held Papua at the outbreak of war, and remained outside militarised areas. Detzner claimed to have penetrated the interior of the German portion (Kaiser Wilhelmsland) in his 1920 book &quot;Vier Jahre unter Kannibalen&quot; (&quot;Four Years Among Cannibals&quot;). These claims were heavily disputed by various German missionaries, and Detzner recanted most of his claims in 1932.

After the Treaty of Versailles of 1919, Germany lost all its colonial possessions, including German New Guinea. In 1923, the League of Nations gave Australia a trustee mandate over Nauru, with the United Kingdom and New Zealand as co-trustees. Other lands south of the equator became the Territory of New Guinea, a League of Nations Mandate Territory under Australian administration until 1949 (interrupted by Japanese occupation during the New Guinea campaign) when it was merged with the Australian territory of Papua to become the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, which eventually became modern Papua New Guinea. The islands north of the equator became the Japanese League of Nations Mandate for the South Seas Islands. After Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II, the former Japanese mandate islands were administered by the United States as the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, a United Nations trust territory.

== Planned symbols for German New Guinea ==

In 1914 a series of drafts were made for proposed coats of arms and flags for the German colonies. However, World War I broke out before the designs were finished and implemented, and the symbols were never actually put into use. Following its defeat in the war, Germany lost all its colonies, and the prepared coats of arms and flags were therefore never used.

<text>Bihari languages are a group of the Indo-Aryan languages. The Bihari languages are mainly spoken in the Indian states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal, and also in Nepal. The most widely spoken languages of the Bihari group are Bhojpuri, Magahi and Maithili.

Despite the large number of speakers of these languages, only Maithili has been constitutionally recognised in India, which gained constitutional status via the 92nd amendment to the Constitution of India, of 2003 (gaining assent in 2004). Both Maithili and Bhojpuri have constitutional recognition in Nepal. Bhojpuri is also official in Fiji as Fiji Hindi. There are demands for including Bhojpuri in the 8th schedule of Indian constitution. 

In Bihar, Hindi is the language used for educational and official matters. These languages were legally absorbed under the overarching label Hindi in the 1961 Census. Such state and national politics are creating conditions for language endangerments. After independence Hindi was given the sole official status through the Bihar Official Language Act, 1950. Hindi was displaced as the sole official language of Bihar in 1981, when Urdu was accorded the status of the second official language.

== Speakers ==
The number of speakers of Bihari languages is difficult to indicate because of unreliable sources. In the urban region most educated speakers of the language name Hindi as their language because this is what they use in formal contexts and believe it to be the appropriate response because of unawareness. The educated and the urban population of the region return Hindi as the generic name for their language.

British linguist Grierson also mentioned that Bajjika, Angika and Surjapuri are also spoken in particular districts of Bihar. These languages are mostly spoken in rural areas.

<doc id="371325" wikidata="Q206223" url="?curid=371325" title="Francis II of the Two Sicilies">
<text>Francis II (Neapolitan and , ; christened &quot;Francesco d&#x27;Assisi Maria Leopoldo&quot;; 16 January 1836 – 27 December 1894) was King of the Two Sicilies. He was the last King of the Two Sicilies as successive invasions by Giuseppe Garibaldi and Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia ultimately brought an end to his rule, as part of Italian unification. After he was deposed, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and the Kingdom of Sardinia were merged into the newly formed Kingdom of Italy.

==Early life==
The only son and heir of King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies by his first wife, Maria Christina of Savoy, Francis II was the last of the Bourbon kings of Naples, where he was born in 1836. His education had been much neglected and he proved a man of weak character, greatly influenced by his stepmother, Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria, whom he feared, and also by the priests and the camarilla, the reactionary court set.

On 3 February 1859 in Bari, Francis married Duchess Maria Sophie of Bavaria, of the royal Bavarian house of Wittelsbach (a younger sister of Empress Elisabeth &quot;Sissi&quot; of Austria). However, their marriage was unhappy. Their only daughter, Maria Cristina Pia, was born ten years after her parents married and lived only three months (24 December 1869 – 28 March 1870).

==Reign==
Francis II took the throne on 22 May 1859, after the death of his father. For the post of prime minister, he at once appointed Carlo Filangieri, who realised the importance of the Franco-Piedmontese victories in Lombardy and advised Francis II to accept the alliance with the Kingdom of Sardinia proposed by Cavour. On 7 June, a part of the Swiss Guard mutinied, and while the king mollified them by promising to redress their grievances, General Alessandro Nunziante gathered his troops, who surrounded the mutineers and shot them down. The incident resulted in the disbanding of the whole Swiss Guard, which was the strongest bulwark of the Bourbon dynasty.
Cavour again proposed an alliance to divide the Papal States between Piedmont and Naples (the province of Rome excepted), but Francis rejected the idea, which to him seemed like heresy. Filangieri strongly advocated a constitution as the only measure which might save the dynasty, but on the king&#x27;s refusal, he resigned.

===Garibaldi&#x27;s invasion===

Meanwhile, the revolutionary parties were conspiring for the overthrow of the Bourbons in Calabria and Sicily, and Giuseppe Garibaldi was preparing for a raid in the south of Italy. A conspiracy in Sicily was discovered and the plotters punished with brutal severity, but Rosalino Pilo and Francesco Crispi, who had organised the movement, escaped execution. When Garibaldi landed at Marsala (May 1860) with his Expedition of the Thousand, he conquered the island with astonishing ease.

Those events at last coaxed Francis II into granting a constitution, but its promulgation was followed by disorders in Naples and the resignation of several ministers; Liborio Romano became head of the government. The disintegration of the army and navy proceeded apace, and Cavour sent a Piedmontese squadron carrying troops on board to watch over these events. Garibaldi had crossed the strait of Messina and was advancing northward. After long hesitations and even an appeal to Garibaldi himself and on the advice of Romano, Francis II left Naples on 6 September with his wife, Maria Sophie; the court; and the diplomatic corps (except the French and British ministers) and went by sea to Gaeta, where a large part of the army was concentrated.

The next day, Garibaldi entered Naples, was enthusiastically welcomed, and formed a provisional government.

===Piedmontese invasion===
King Victor Emmanuel II had decided on the invasion of the Papal States and after occupying Umbria and the Marche, he entered the Neapolitan kingdom. Garibaldi&#x27;s troops defeated the Neapolitan royalists at the Battle of Volturno, which took place on 1 October 1860, and the Piedmontese captured Capua.

By late 1860, only Gaeta, Messina and Civitella del Tronto still held out. The Siege of Gaeta by the Piedmontese began on 6 November 1860. Both Francis II and his wife behaved with great coolness and courage. Even after the French fleet, whose presence had prevented an attack by sea, was withdrawn, they still resisted. It was not until 13 February 1861 that the fortress capitulated.

==Overthrow==
Thus, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies ceased to exist, and its territory was incorporated into that of the Kingdom of Sardinia (soon renamed the Kingdom of Italy), and Francis II was deposed. Francis and Maria Sophie first lived in Rome as guests of the Pope, where they maintained a government in exile that was recognised by some Catholic powers, including France, Spain, Austria-Hungary and Bavaria. After the Prussian victory against Austria in 1866 and the subsequent expansion of Italian territory, they disbanded this government and left Rome before it was occupied by the Italians in 1870. They led a wandering life from then on by living in Austria, France and Bavaria. In 1894, Francis died at Arco in Trentino (now north-eastern Italy, but at the time in Austria-Hungary). His widow survived him by 31 years and died in Munich.

Upon the death of Francis II, his half-brother, Prince Alfonso, became the pretender to the throne of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.

== Cause of beatification and canonization ==

On 11 December 2020, the cause of the beatification of King Francis II of the Two Sicilies was introduced by Crescenzio Cardinal Sepe, the Archbishop of Naples. Pope Francis declared the king a Servant of God.

<doc id="371327" wikidata="Q785480" url="?curid=371327" title="Bolo tie">
<text>A bolo tie (sometimes bola tie or shoestring necktie) is a type of necktie consisting of a piece of cord or braided leather with decorative metal tips (called aiguillettes) and secured with an ornamental clasp or slide.

==Popularity==
In the United States, bolo ties are widely associated with Western wear and are generally most common in the western areas of the country. Bolo tie slides and tips in silver have been part of Hopi, Navajo, Zuni, and Puebloan silversmithing traditions since the mid-20th century.

The bolo tie was made the official neckwear of Arizona on April 22, 1971, by Governor Jack Williams. New Mexico passed a non-binding measure to designate the bolo as the state&#x27;s official neckwear in 1987. On March 13, 2007, New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson signed into law that the bolo tie was the state&#x27;s official tie. Also in 2007, the bolo tie was named the official tie of Texas.
In the United Kingdom, bolo ties are known as bootlace ties. They were popular with 1950s Teddy Boys, who wore them with drape suits.

Bolo ties became fashionable in the 1980s with rockabilly revivalists and new wavers. The bolo tie returned as a popular fashion accessory in the fall of 1988 when male Hollywood stars would be frequently found wearing them. Chain stores like Jeanswest and Merry-Go-Round sold multiple choices for all occasions.

During the 1980s and 1990s bolo ties, some elegant and expensive, were sold in Japan, Korea, and China. Some had fancy, hand-made cords and unusual tips. Sales overseas skyrocketed post-1970s; this was due to the overflow from the United States, where it had fallen out of fashion in the 1980s.

Author John Bloom (a.k.a. horror host and drive-in expert Joe Bob Briggs) is known by his trademark wearing of various bolo ties during his televised and live shows.

During the 2013 NFL season, San Diego Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers captured media attention for his frequent use of bolo ties. He was noted wearing it again after defeating the Cincinnati Bengals in the 2013–14 NFL playoffs.

==Origins==
Victor Cedarstaff of Wickenburg, Arizona, claims to have invented the bolo tie in the late 1940s and later patented his slide design.

<doc id="371332" wikidata="Q2010576" url="?curid=371332" title="Penistone">
<text>Penistone ( ) is a market town and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England, which had a population of 24,760 at the 2021 census. Historically in the West Riding of Yorkshire, it is west of Barnsley, north-east of Glossop, north-west of Sheffield, south-west of Leeds and east of Manchester in the foothills of the Pennines. The town is frequently noted on lists of unusual place names.

The highest point, Hartcliffe Tower, is above sea level and has views over the Woodhead bypass and the Dark Peak. The surrounding countryside is predominantly rural with farming on rich well-watered soil on mainly gentle slopes rising to the bleak moorland to the west of the town. Dry stone walls, small hamlets and farms surrounded by fields and livestock are synonymous with the area. The area is known for its rugged breed of sheep, the Whitefaced Woodland.

The market town itself stands at its highest point around St Johns Church at around above sea level. However, the surrounding land rises well over towards Cubley and Thurlstone Moors and out towards smaller hamlets at Carlecotes, Victoria, Dunford and Crow Edge, elevated at points above . There are several vantage points around Penistone that afford panoramic views of the surrounding areas of West Yorkshire and North Derbyshire.

==History==
===Etymology===
The place-name &quot;Penistone&quot; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &quot;Pengeston(e)&quot; and &quot;Pangeston&quot;; later sources record it as &quot;Peningston&quot;. It may mean &quot;the farmstead at the hill called Penning&quot;, in reference to the high ridge immediately south of the town. This combines the Brittonic word &quot;penn&quot; (meaning a head, end, or height) with the Old English suffix &quot;ing&quot; and the word &quot;tun&quot; (meaning a farmstead or village).

Penistone has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place-names because it contains the letter sequence &quot;penis&quot;; however, those initial five letters are not pronounced like the name of the body part.

===Medieval history===
Since the times of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria and at least Viking times Penistone was historically within the Wapentake of Staincross, an area that almost corresponds with the present day Barnsley Metropolitan Borough.

In 1066, the township was owned by Ailric. It was razed in 1069 in the Harrying of the North following the Norman Conquest; the Domesday Book described the settlement in 1086 as &quot;waste&quot;.

Sir Gyles Penyston (fl. 13th century), whose family seat was in Cornwall (perhaps at Truro) before his time, and who is an ancestor of the Penyston Baronets, was styled &quot;of Penyston&quot;, denoting that he resided in Penistone.

===Wool===
The town was renowned for its &quot;Penistone cloth&quot; (or &quot;forest white&quot;), a rough, home-spun cloth. In a law passed in 1601 (43 Eliz. 1 cap. 10) regulating the working of cloth, penalties were set out for weavers found to be making Penistone cloth of inferior quality. Until the eighteenth century, home weavers in the area brought their products to town for sale in an annual cloth fair but in 1768 a Cloth Hall (or &quot;piece hall&quot;) was built by subscription to facilitate regular sales to wool merchants. 

Sheep sales have been held in the town since before 1699, when the market received a royal charter and the area produced the now rare Penistone sheep.

===Buildings===
The town remained small until the coming of the railway in 1845, although several pre-19th century buildings survive. The oldest still standing is Penistone Church. This is the Grade I listed medieval parish church, St John the Baptist Church. The White Hart pub in the town dates from 1377. Penistone had a market for a long time before its royal charter was granted in 1699, although its historic livestock market was closed recently to make way for town centre re-development. A new landmark building has been built in Penistone for the Market Place. This is an oaken Cruck Barn and was built by Carpenter Oak of Totnes, Devon.

===Railway===

The Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway opened on 15 July 1845, on a route via Penistone, Dunford Bridge and the three-mile long Woodhead Tunnel.

The Penistone to Huddersfield railway line opened on 1 July 1850. Penistone became a railway junction, with a depot for engineering trains. Penistone station had frequent train services to Manchester, Sheffield and Huddersfield.

The 29-arch Penistone Viaduct was built in 1849 by Messrs. Ingham and Bower to a design by Sir John Hawkshaw. Stone was obtained from Walk Mill Bank, Oxspring, and was conveyed by a tramway on the side of the River Don. The second and third arches of Penistone Viaduct collapsed on 2 February 1916, when heavy rain weakened the foundations; the driver and fireman of a stationary goods locomotive were able to jump clear and survive the collapse. Cracks in the parapet had been observed some days earlier. The viaduct was repaired and was back in service in August of the same year.

The town was served by the Woodhead line between Manchester London Road and Sheffield Victoria. Following major investment, which started in 1935 but was delayed by the Second World War, the electrification of the railway was completed in 1954, and the line&#x27;s power control centre was built adjacent to Penistone station. The building still stands and has been converted for commercial use. The Woodhead line was the first main line railway in the UK to be electrified, but its once-pioneering 1500 V DC system became non-standard.

Although the Beeching Report recommended the closure of the Hope Valley line and the retention of Woodhead services, the government chose to implement the opposite; Woodhead line passenger services beyond Hadfield ended on 5 January 1970. Goods trains (mainly coal) continued to travel through the station for a further 11 years until the line was closed controversially between Penistone and Hadfield in July 1981; the track was lifted several years later. The route of the track is now used as part of the Trans-Pennine Trail.

==Transport==
Penistone railway station is on the Penistone Line, which provides passenger trains to Huddersfield, Barnsley and Sheffield. Services are generally hourly in each direction, operated by Northern Trains.

Bus services in the area are operated by Stagecoach Yorkshire, South Pennine Community Transport, Globe Holidays (Barnsley) and TM Travel. Routes connect Penistone with Barnsley, Holmfirth, Sheffield, Stocksbridge and Thurgoland.

==Governance==
Penistone was a parish in the wapentake of Staincross in the West Riding of Yorkshire and after 1837 was a member of the Wortley Poor law union.

Penistone was in the Barnsley West and Penistone constituency until the 2010 general election when it became part of the newly created Penistone and Stocksbridge constituency.

Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council is responsible for local government issues and Penistone Town Council, based at Penistone Town Hall, is responsible for local issues.

==Geography==
Penistone is situated on the south bank of the River Don. The parish, which included Gunthwaite, Hunshelf, Ingbirchworth, Langsett, Oxspring, and Thurlstone, covered 21,338 acres, mostly arable land and pasture and 2,000 acres of moorland. The underlying geology is the coal measures of the South Yorkshire Coalfield, from which some coal was mined in the 19th century, and sandstone flags were quarried.

==Economy==

Penistone has a thriving market, although smaller since the building of a Tesco supermarket in 2011, which reduced the market footprint. The cattle market, which was the centre of the farming livestock trade, and the &quot;Fur n Feathers&quot; market, have long since gone. At elevation, Penistone is among the highest market towns in Yorkshire.

The Market Cruck Barn was officially opened on 21 July 2011. Penistone Farmers&#x27; Market is a monthly farmers&#x27; market on the second Saturday of every month held in the market place.

<text>Fijian (&quot;&quot;) is an Austronesian language of the Malayo-Polynesian family spoken by some 350,000–450,000 ethnic Fijians as a native language. The 2013 Constitution established Fijian as an official language of Fiji, along with English and Fiji Hindi and there is discussion about establishing it as the &quot;national language&quot;. Fijian is a VOS language.

Standard Fijian is based on the Bau dialect, which is an East Fijian language.
A pidginized form is used by many Indo-Fijians and Chinese on the islands, while Pidgin Hindustani is used by many rural ethnic Fijians and Chinese in areas dominated by Indo-Fijians.

== History ==
=== History of the language ===
The Fijian language was introduced to Fiji 3500 years ago by the islands&#x27; first settlers. For millennia, it was the only spoken language in Fiji. In 1835, Methodist missionaries from Australia worked in Fiji to develop a written form of the language. By 1840, they had already developed a writing system, and had published various books on the different dialects of the language. After the independence of Fiji in 1970, Fijian has been used in radio, television, books, and periodicals, and has been taught in schools.

=== National language debate ===
In May and June 2005, several prominent Fijians sought to promote the status of the Fijian language. Fiji had no official language before the 1997 Constitution, which made the Fijian language co-official with English and Fiji Hindi; however, it was not required to be taught in schools. The minister of education, Ro Teimumu Kepa, has also supported appeals to Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs Ratu Ovini Bokini. Similar appeals have been made by Misiwini Qereqeretabua, Director of the Institute of Language and Culture, and by Apolonia Tamata, a linguistics professor at the University of the South Pacific in Suva. They have stated that recognition of the Fijian language is essential for the basic identity of the nation and acts as a unifying factor for the multicultural society of Fiji.

Mahendra Chaudhry, the leader of the Fiji Labour Party, also supported the cause to make Fijian a national language and a compulsory subject in schools with the same status as Fiji Hindi, a position echoed by Krishna Vilas of the National Reconciliation Committee.

Since 2013, when a new constitution was adopted, Fijian is established as an official language of Fiji alongside Fiji Hindi and English.

== Phonology ==
The consonant phonemes of Fijian are as shown in the following table:

The consonant written has been described as a prenasalized trill or trilled affricate . However, it is only rarely pronounced with a trilled release; the primary feature distinguishing it from is that it is postalveolar, , rather than dental/alveolar.

The sounds and occur only in loanwords from other languages. The sounds and only occur for speakers from certain regions of the country.

The sounds and occur as allophones of and .

The glottal stop occurs in the Boumaa Fijian used to illustrate this article, but is not found in the standard language. It descends from an earlier sound in most Fijian dialects.

Note the difference in place of articulation between the voiced-voiceless fricative pairs: bilabial vs. labiodental , and dental vs. alveolar .

The vowel phonemes are:


In addition, there is the rising diphthong .

Syllables can consist of a consonant followed by a vowel (CV) or a single vowel (V).
Word stress is based on moras: a short vowel is one mora, diphthongs and long vowels are two morae. Primary stress is on the penultimate mora of the phonological word. That is, if the last syllable of a word is short, then the penultimate syllable will be stressed, while if the last syllable contains either a long vowel or a diphthong, then it receives primary stress. Stress is not lexical and can shift when suffixes are attached to the root.
Examples:
*Stress on the penultimate syllable (final short vowel): , ;
*Stress on the final syllable (diphthong): , (the stress extends over the whole diphthong).
*Stress shift: , → , 

== Orthography ==
The Fijian alphabet is based on the Latin script and consists of the following letters. There is almost a one-to-one correspondence between letters and phonemes.

In the 1980s, scholars compiling a dictionary added several more consonants and a few consonant clusters to the alphabet. These newcomers were necessary to handle words entering Standard Fijian from not only English, but from other Fijian languages or dialects as well. These are the most important additions: , as in and , as in .

For phonological reasons and are pronounced , rather than , (cf. Japanese chi kana, or in standard Brazilian Portuguese). Hence, the Fijian name for Fiji, , from an allophonic pronunciation of as .

In addition, the digraph stands for retroflex , or a prenasalized trill in careful pronunciation, or more commonly for some people and in some dialects.

The vowel letters have roughly their IPA values, . The vowel length contrast is not usually indicated in writing, except in dictionaries and textbooks for learners of the language, where it is indicated by a macron over the vowel in question; Dixon, in the work cited below, doubles all long vowels in his spelling system. Diphthongs are , pronounced .

== Morpho-syntax ==
:&quot;Note: the examples in this section are from Bouma dialect. It is not Standard Fijian, which is based on the Bauan dialect.&quot;

=== Negation ===
In order to negate a phrase or clause in Fijian, certain verbs are used to create this distinction. These verbs of negation are known as semi-auxiliary verbs. Semi-auxiliary verbs fulfil the functions of main verbs (in terms of syntactic form and pattern) and have a NP or complement clause as their subject (complements clauses within negation are introduced by relators (which refers to an event, which is generally a non-specific unit) or (which refers is translated as &quot;should&quot;, referring to the event within the complement clause should occur)). Within a complement clause, the semi-auxiliary verb qualifies the predicate.

==== Semi-auxiliary verbs ====
One semi-auxiliary verb used to express negation in Fijian is . This semi-auxiliary can be translated as either &quot;there are no-&quot; or &quot;it is not the case that&quot;, depending on the subject it relates to. In terms of numerical expression, is also used to express the quantity &quot;none&quot;. This negator can be used in almost all situations, with the exception of the imperative or in a (classifier) clauses. When takes a NP as its subject, the meaning &quot;there are no-&quot; is assumed:

Predicate clauses can also be negated in Fijian with the semi-auxiliary verb . This can only be completed when the predicate is placed into a complement clause. The subject of must also be , which introduces the complement clause. It is then translated as &quot;it is not the case that (predicate clause)&quot;. An example of this construction is shown here:
 
Hence, the only way a verb (which is generally the head of a predicate phrase) can be negated in Fijian is when it forms part of the [ VERB] construction. However, in Fijian the head of a predicate phrase may belong to almost any word class. If another word (e.g. a noun) is used, the structure of negation alters. This distinction can be shown through diverse examples of the negating NPs in Fijian. The below examples show the difference between a noun as the head of a NP and a noun as the head of a predicate in a complement clause, within negation:

;NP as subject of 
; as the subject of 
Additionally, can also work with relator which introduces interrogative clauses. This combination creates a form translatable as &quot;or not&quot;:

Another common negator is or , which is translatable as &quot;don&#x27;t, not&quot;. Differently to , this semi-auxiliary verb is used for imperatives and in clauses. Therefore, these semi-auxiliaries are fixed, and cannot be used interchangeably. and have the same meaning, however may be more intense; in most instances either semi-auxiliary verb can be used. ~ can take a NP as its subject, but most commonly takes the complement as a subject, which is demonstrated below:

An example of ~ used in imperative structure can be seen here:

In the case of pronouns, they can only be negated when they form part of the NP, when acting as the predicate head. Therefore, pronouns cannot be the NP subject of semi-auxiliary verbs or ~ in the way that general nouns can.

===== Combining semi-auxiliary verbs =====
 and ~ can be combined with other auxiliary verbs to produce diverse constructions. Both and ~ can connect with semi-auxiliary to negate the concept of possibility which is attached to the verb (resulting in constructions such as and ).

==== Modifiers in negation ====
Two main modifiers, and play key roles in negation in Fijian, and work in conjunction with semi-auxiliary verbs. is added after negators and ~ , and functions as an intensity marker. The construction is translatable as . The construction requires an adjective (or an adverb which results from an adjective), and must take (complement clause) as its subject in order to function. can be found in position immediately after , but may also be found after the relator without changing the meaning of the phrase. The primary construction is shown below:

Similarly, to , the modifier can also be used in conjunction with and ~ . This combination is used to stress the negative sense and aspect of a phrase.

=== Pronouns and person markers ===
The pronominal system of Fijian is remarkably rich. Like many other languages, it recognises three persons; first person (speaker),
second person (addressee), and third person (all other). There is no distinction between human, non-human, animate, or inanimate. 
Four numbers are represented; singular, dual, paucal, and plural—&#x27;paucal&#x27; refers to more than two people who have some relationship, as a family or work group; if none, &#x27;plural&#x27; is used. Like many other Oceanic languages, Fijian pronouns are marked for number and clusivity.

==== Forms and function ====
Each pronoun can have five forms, but some person-number combinations may have the same form for more than one function, as can be seen in the table above.

The forms are:

Cardinal – used when a pronoun occurs as the head of a NP. A cardinal pronoun is usually preceded by the proper article , except when preceded by a preposition:

Subject – the first constituent of a predicate, acts as person marking. Examples can be seen in examples (1) and (2) above: and , and (3) below: 

Object – follows the -final form of a transitive verb:

Possessive suffix – attaches to inalienable nouns, and

Possessive – precedes the NP head of the &#x27;possessed&#x27; constituent in a possessive construction.

(For more information on the form and function of these possessive pronouns, see Possession.)

==== Use ====
The major clausal structure in Fijian minimally includes a predicate, which usually has a verb at its head. The initial element in the predicate is the subject form pronoun:


This &#x27;subject marker + verb&#x27; predicate construction is obligatory, every other constituent is optional. The subject may be expanded upon by an NP following the predicate:

The subject pronoun constituent of a predicate acts mainly as a person marker.

Fijian is a verb–object–subject language, and the subject pronoun may be translated as its equivalent in English, the subject NP of a clause in Fijian follows the verb and the object if it is included.

The social use of pronouns is largely driven by respect and hierarchy. Each of the non-singular second person pronouns can be used for a singular addressee. For example, if one&#x27;s actual or potential in-laws are addressed, the 2DU pronoun should be used. Similarly, when a brother or sister of the opposite sex is addressed, the 2PA pronoun should be used, and it can also be used for same-sex siblings when the speaker wishes to show respect. The 2PL pronoun can be used to show respect to elders, particularly the village chief.

=== Possession ===
Possession is a grammatical term for a special relationship between two entities: a &quot;possessor&quot; and a &quot;possessed&quot;. The relationship may be one of legal ownership, but in Fijian, like many other Austronesian languages, it is often much broader, encompassing kin relations, body parts, parts of an inanimate whole and personal qualities and concepts such as control, association and belonging.

Fijian has a complex system of possessive constructions, depending on the nature of the possessor and of the possessed. Choosing the appropriate structure depends on knowing whether the possessor is a personal or place name, a pronoun, or a common noun (with human or non-human, animate or inanimate reference), and also on whether the possessed is a free or bound noun.

==== Possessor ====
Only an animate noun may be a possessor in the true possessive constructions shown below, with possession marked on the possessed NP in a number of ways. For personal and place name possessors, the possessive construction may be made by affixing the possessive suffix to the possessed noun, bound or free. If the possessor is a pronoun, the possessed noun must be marked by one of the pronominal markers which specify person, number and inclusivity/exclusivity (see table). If the possessor is inanimate, the possessive particle is usually placed between the possessed NP and the possessor NP. The particle then indicates association, rather than formal possession, but the construction is still regarded as a possessive construction.

==== Possessed ====
Free nouns can stand alone and need no affix; most nouns in Fijian fall into this class. Bound nouns require a suffix to complete them and are written ending in a hyphen to indicate this requirement. and are examples of bound nouns. The classes of free and bound nouns roughly correspond with the concept, common in Austronesian languages, of alienable and inalienable possession, respectively. Alienable possession denotes a relationship in which the thing possessed is not culturally considered an inherent part of the possessor, and inalienable possession indicates a relationship in which the possessed is regarded as an intrinsic part of the possessor.

Body parts and kin relations are typical examples of inalienable possession. Inanimate objects are typical examples of alienable possession.

The alienable nature of free nouns is further marked by prefixes, known as classifiers, indicating certain other characteristics. Some common examples are when the possessed noun is something drinkable, (or ) when the noun is something edible and when the referent of the possessed noun is personal property.

==== Possessive constructions ====

The word order of a possessive construction for all except inanimate possessors is possessed NP-classifier(CLF) + possessive marker (POSS) + possessor NP. For an inanimate possessor, the word order is possessed NP + + possessor NP.

Note that there is some degree of flexibility in the use of possessive constructions as described in this table.

==== Examples ====



== Syntax ==
The normal Fijian word order is VOS (verb–object–subject):

== National language debate ==

In May and June 2005, a number of prominent Fiji Islanders called for the status of Fijian to be upgraded. It was not an official language before the adoption of the 1997 Constitution, which made it co-official with English and Fiji Hindi. It is still not a compulsory subject in schools, but then Education Minister, Ro Teimumu Kepa, had endorsed calls for that to change, as had the former Great Council of Chiefs Chairman Ratu Ovini Bokini. Similar calls also came from Misiwini Qereqeretabua, the former Director of the Institute of Fijian Language and Culture, and from Apolonia Tamata, a linguistics lecturer at Suva&#x27;s University of the South Pacific, both of whom said that recognition of the Fijian language is essential to the nation&#x27;s basic identity and as a unifying factor in Fiji&#x27;s multicultural society.

The Fiji Labour Party leader Mahendra Chaudhry also endorsed the call for Fijian to be made a national language and a compulsory school subject if the same status was given to Fiji Hindi, a position that was echoed by Krishna Vilas of the National Reconciliation Committee.

<text>Shashlik, or shashlyck ( &quot;shashlyk&quot;), is a dish of skewered and grilled cubes of meat, similar to or synonymous with shish kebab. It is known traditionally by various other names in the Caucasus, Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and from the 19th century became popular as &quot;shashlik&quot; across much of the Russian Empire and nowadays in former Soviet Union republics.

== Etymology and history ==
The word &quot;shashlik&quot; or &quot;shashlick&quot; entered English from the Russian , of Turkic origin. In Turkic languages, the word &quot;shish&quot; means skewer, and &quot;shishlik&quot; is literally translated as &quot;skewerable&quot;. The word was coined from the &#x27; (&#x27;spit&#x27;) by the Zaporozhian Cossacks and entered Russian in the 18th century, from there spreading to English and other European languages. Prior to that, the Russian name for meat cooked on a skewer was &#x27;, from &quot;&quot;, &#x27;spit&#x27;. Shashlik did not reach Moscow until the late 19th century. From then on, its popularity spread rapidly; by the 1910s it was a staple in St Petersburg restaurants and by the 1920s it was already a pervasive street food all over urban Russia.

== Preparation ==

Shashlik was originally made of lamb, but nowadays it is also made of pork, beef, chicken or venison, depending on local preferences and religious observances. The skewers are either threaded with meat only, or with alternating pieces of meat, fat, and vegetables, such as bell pepper, onion, mushroom and tomato. In Iranian cuisine, meat for shashlik (as opposed to other forms of &quot;shish kebab&quot;) is usually in large chunks, while elsewhere the form of medium-size meat cubes is maintained making it similar to brochette. The meat is marinated overnight in a high-acidity marinade like vinegar, dry wine or sour fruit/vegetable juice with the addition of onions, herbs and spices.

While it is not unusual to see shashlik today listed on the menu of restaurants, it is more commonly sold in many areas in the form of fast food by street vendors who roast the skewers on a mangal over wood, charcoal, or coal. It is also cooked in outdoor environments during social gatherings, similarly to barbecue in English-speaking countries.

Despite the simplicity of preparing shashlik, the process of frying meat over an open fire can cause inconvenience for residents of apartment buildings.

<text>The Commodore 64 (C64) demos are demonstrations of what can be done to push the limits of the Commodore 64 computer, made by programmers, musicians and artists.

Though it was not unusual to find demos that displayed a single picture, only music tracks or a programming skill, groups were formed that consisted of members who were skilled in composing music, drawing graphics and programming. Full disk demos were produced, some of which would play music as the next file loaded, without any delay in the sound.


Various effects are achieved in demos, most of them due to undocumented side-effects pertaining to the MOS Technology VIC-II chip. Some examples are:
* Sprite scrollers were placed in the border. By tricking the hardware not to draw the border around the screen, sprites could be moved into this area and displayed.
* Sprites were multiplexed across vertical raster lines (over 8 sprites, sometimes up to 120 sprites). A common perception is that no more than 8 sprites could appear at once on the screen, but assigning new Y coordinates once it has started being drawn made it reappear further down the screen.
* FLD (flexible line distance) moved bitmap or character rows an arbitrary number of vertical raster lines apart, making it possible to arbitrarily move any 8 pixel high graphic block smoothly up and down across the screen. Adding sine curves to this positioning provided a wavy effect.
* FLI, or Flexible Line Interpretation, can be used to increase the number of unique colors which can appear in an 8×8 or 8×4 block on the screen. This mode is occasionally extended further with sprites and/or interlacing two bitmaps together (as in SHIFLI or UIFLI). These modes usually cause the left-most 24 pixels of the display to become unusable.
* FPP (Flexible Pixel Positioning), basically a variation of the FLI mode, allows the placement of any line of a character-based graphic at any one y-position, allowing for effects like x-rotating logos, barrel-like effects or smooth stretching and waving over the whole screen.
* Tec-Tec (also Tech-Tech or Tic Tac) assigns a new x-position to any line of a graphic. By using animated sine waves you could for example wave a logo horizontally over the screen.
* VSP (Variable Screen Positioning), also known as HSP, allows arbitrary x-placement of a bitmap, with the bitmap wrapping around at the border.
* A Linecruncher allows the user to scroll a bitmap larger than one screen vertically without having to move all the bitmap data manually.
* AGSP (Any Given Screen Position) is the combination of VSP and Linecruncher, for example making possible games with colorful bitmap graphics that scrolled, such as Hannes Sommer&#x27;s &quot;Fred&#x27;s Back&quot; series.

Followers of the C64 would see the growth of the demo scene. Gone were the single file demos with one scrolling text and no music. Full disk demos were produced, some of which would play music as the next file loaded, without any delay in the sound.

Hidden parts were included as was the occasional game implemented into a demo.

When the Commodore Amiga appeared, many former C64 demo programmers switched platforms and continued to make demos for the Amiga (see Amiga demos). The Atari demos were also heavily influenced by C64 demos. In the United Kingdom, the main alternative demo scene was the one of ZX Spectrum demos.

The C64 was popular in a time when local BBSes were also popular and used to communicate with other people. Software trading via mail was also common. Some C64 enthusiasts lament the loss of the social interaction that locally centered computer activities provided.

<doc id="371343" wikidata="Q33552" url="?curid=371343" title="Kashmiri language">
<text>Kashmiri ( ) or Koshur (Kashmiri: , , ) is a Dardic Indo-Aryan language spoken by around 7 million Kashmiris of the Kashmir region, primarily in the Kashmir Valley and Chenab Valley of the Indian-administrated union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, over half the population of that territory. Kashmiri has split ergativity and the unusual verb-second word order.

Since 2020, It has been made an official language of Jammu and Kashmir along with Dogri, Hindi, Urdu and English. Kashmiri is also among the 22 scheduled languages of India.

Kashmiri is spoken by roughly five percent of Pakistani-administrated Azad Kashmir&#x27;s population.

== Geographic distribution and status ==
There are about 6.8 million speakers of Kashmiri and related dialects in Jammu and Kashmir and amongst the Kashmiri diaspora in other states of India. Most Kashmiri speakers are located in the Kashmir Valley, Chenab valley and other areas of Jammu and Kashmir. In kashmir valley and Chenab valley they form Majority.

Kashmiri is spoken by roughly five percent of Azad Kashmir&#x27;s population. According to the 1998 Pakistan Census, there were 132,450 Kashmiri speakers in Azad Kashmir. Native speakers of the language were dispersed in &quot;pockets&quot; throughout Azad Kashmir, particularly in the districts of Muzaffarabad (15%), Neelam (20%) and Hattian (15%), with very small minorities in Haveli (5%) and Bagh (2%). The Kashmiri spoken in Muzaffarabad is distinct from, although still intelligible with, the Kashmiri of the Neelam Valley to the north. In Neelam Valley, Kashmiri is the second most widely spoken language and the majority language in at least a dozen or so villages, where in about half of these, it is the sole mother tongue. The Kashmiri dialect of Neelum is closer to the variety spoken in northern Kashmir Valley, particularly Kupwara. At the 2017 Census of Pakistan, as many as 350,000 people declared their first language to be Kashmiri.

A process of language shift is observable among Kashmiri-speakers in Azad Kashmir according to linguist Tariq Rahman, as they gradually adopt local dialects such as Pahari-Pothwari, Hindko or move towards the &quot;lingua franca&quot; Urdu. This has resulted in these languages gaining ground at the expense of Kashmiri. There have been calls for the promotion of Kashmiri at an official level; in 1983, a Kashmiri Language Committee was set up by the government to patronise Kashmiri and impart it in school-level education. However, the limited attempts at introducing the language have not been successful, and it is Urdu, rather than Kashmiri, that Kashmiri Muslims of Azad Kashmir have seen as their identity symbol. Rahman notes that efforts to organise a Kashmiri language movement have been challenged by the scattered nature of the Kashmiri-speaking community in Azad Kashmir.

The Kashmiri language is one of the 22 scheduled languages of India. It was a part of the &quot;Eighth Schedule&quot; in the former constitution of Jammu and Kashmir. Along with other regional languages mentioned in the &quot;Sixth Schedule&quot;, as well as Hindi and Urdu, the Kashmiri language was to be developed in the state. After Hindi, Kashmiri is the second fastest growing language of India, followed by Meitei (Manipuri) as well as Gujarati in the third place, and Bengali in the fourth place, according to the 2011 census of India.

Persian began to be used as the court language in Kashmir during the 14th centuries, under the influence of Islam. It was replaced by Urdu in 1889 during the Dogra rule. In 2020, Kashmiri became an official language in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir for the first time.

Poguli and Kishtwari are closely related to Kashmiri, which are spoken in the mountains to the south of the Kashmir Valley and have sometimes been counted as dialects of Kashmiri.

The people in the Chenab region of Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir primarily speak Kashmiri but the accent and some words are a little bit different and they are sometimes referred as &quot;Chenabi Kashmiris&quot; meaning Kashmiris of Chenab Valley.

==Phonology==

Kashmiri has the following phonemes.

===Vowels===
The oral vowels are as follows:

The short high vowels are near-high, and the low vowels apart from are near-low.

Nasalization is phonemic. All sixteen oral vowels have nasal counterparts.

===Consonants===
Palatalization is phonemic. All consonants apart from those in the post-alveolar/palatal column have palatalized counterparts.

===Archaisms===

Kashmiri, as also the other Dardic languages, shows important divergences from the Indo-Aryan mainstream. One is the partial maintenance of the three sibilant consonants &quot;s ṣ ś&quot; of the Old Indo-Aryan period. For another example, the prefixing form of the number &#x27;two&#x27;, which is found in Sanskrit as &quot;dvi-&quot;, has developed into &quot;ba-/bi-&quot; in most other Indo-Aryan languages, but &quot;du-&quot; in Kashmiri (preserving the original dental stop &quot;d&quot;). &quot;Seventy-two&quot; is &quot;dusatath&quot; in Kashmiri, &quot;bahattar&quot; in Hindi-Urdu and Punjabi, and &quot;dvisaptati&quot; in Sanskrit.

Certain features in Kashmiri even appear to stem from Indo-Aryan even predating the Vedic period. For instance, there was an /s/ &gt; /h/ consonant shift in some words that had already occurred with Vedic Sanskrit (This tendency was complete in the Iranian branch of Indo-Iranian), yet is lacking in Kashmiri equivalents. The word &quot;rahit&quot; in Vedic Sanskrit and modern Hindi-Urdu (meaning &#x27;excluding&#x27; or &#x27;without&#x27;) corresponds to &quot;rost&quot; in Kashmiri. Similarly, &quot;sahit&quot; (meaning &#x27;including&#x27; or &#x27;with&#x27;) corresponds to &quot;sost&quot; in Kashmiri.

==Writing system==
There are three orthographical systems used to write the Kashmiri language: the Perso-Arabic script, the Devanagari script and the Sharada script. The Roman script is also sometimes informally used to write Kashmiri, especially online.

Today Kashmiri is primarily written in Perso-Arabic (with some modifications). Among languages written in the Perso-Arabic script, Kashmiri is one of the scripts that regularly indicates all vowel sounds.

The Kashmiri Perso-Arabic script is recognized as the official script of Kashmiri language by the Jammu and Kashmir government and the Jammu and Kashmir Academy of Art, Culture and Languages. The Kashmiri Perso-Arabic script has been derived from Persian alphabet. The consonant inventory and their corresponding pronunciations of Kashmiri Perso-Arabic script doesn&#x27;t differ from Perso-Arabic script, with the exception of the letter ژ, which is pronounced as instead of . However, the vowel inventory of Kashmiri is significantly larger than other Perso-Arabic derived or influenced South Asian Perso-Arabic scripts. There are 17 vowels in Kashmiri, shown with diacritics, letters (alif, waw, ye), or both. In Kashmiri, the convention is that most vowel diacritics are written at all times.

Despite Kashmiri Perso-Arabic script cutting across religious boundaries and being used by both the Kashmiri Hindus and the Kashmiri Muslims, some attempts have been made to give a religious outlook regarding the script and make Kashmiri Perso-Arabic script to be associated with Kashmiri Muslims, while the Kashmiri Devanagari script to be associated with some sections of Kashmiri Hindu community.

The Kashmiri language was traditionally written in the Sharada script after the 8th Century A.D. The script grew increasingly unsuitable for writing Kashmiri because it couldn&#x27;t adequately represent Kashmiri peculiar sounds by the usage of its vowel signs. Therefore, it is not in common use today and is restricted to religious ceremonies of the Kashmiri Pandits.

====Vowels====
There have been a few versions of the Devanagari script for Kashmiri.
The 2002 version of the proposal is shown below. This version has readers and more content available on the Internet, even though this is an older proposal. 
This version makes use of the vowels ॲ/ऑ and vowel signs
कॅ/कॉ for the schwa-like vowel and elongated schwa-like vowel that also exist in other Devanagari-based scripts such as Marathi and Hindi but are used for the sound of other vowels.

Tabulated below is the latest (2009) version of the proposal to spell the Kashmiri vowels with Devanagari. 
The primary change in this version is the changed stand alone characters ॳ / ॴ and vowel signs / for the schwa-like vowel &amp; elongated schwa-like vowel and a new stand alone vowel and vowel sign for the open-mid back rounded vowel which can be used instead of the consonant व standing-in for this vowel.

==Grammar==
Kashmiri is a fusional language with verb-second (V2) word order. Several of Kashmiri&#x27;s grammatical features distinguish it from other Indo-Aryan languages.

===Nouns===
Kashmiri nouns are inflected according to gender, number and case. There are no articles, nor is there any grammatical distinction for definiteness, although there is some optional adverbial marking for indefinite or &quot;generic&quot; noun qualities.

====Gender====
The Kashmiri gender system is divided into masculine and feminine. Feminine forms are typically generated by the addition of a suffix (or in most cases, a morphophonemic change, or both) to a masculine noun. A relatively small group of feminine nouns have unique suppletion forms that are totally different from the corresponding masculine forms. The following table illustrates the range of possible gender forms: 

Some nouns borrowed from other languages, such as Persian, Arabic, Sanskrit, Urdu or English, follow a slightly different gender system. Notably, many words borrowed from Urdu have different genders in Kashmiri.

====Case====
There are five cases in Kashmiri: nominative, dative, ergative, ablative and vocative. Case is expressed via suffixation of the noun.

Kashmiri utilizes an ergative-absolutive case structure when the verb is in simple past tense. Thus, in these sentences, the subject of a transitive verb is marked in the ergative case and the object in nominative, which is identical to how the subject of an intransitive verb is marked. However, in sentences constructed in any other tense, or in past tense sentences with intransitive verbs, a nominative-dative paradigm is adopted, with objects (whether direct or indirect) generally marked in dative case.

Other case distinctions, such as locative, instrumental, genitive, comitative and allative, are marked by postpositions rather than suffixation.

====Noun morphology====
The following table illustrates Kashmiri noun declension according to gender, number and case.

===Verbs===
Kashmiri verbs are declined according to tense and person, and to a lesser extent, gender. Tense, along with certain distinctions of aspect, is formed by the addition of suffixes to the verb stem (minus the infinitive ending - /un/), and in many cases by the addition of various modal auxiliaries. Postpositions fulfill numerous adverbial and semantic roles.

====Tense====
Present tense in Kashmiri is an auxiliary construction formed by a combination of the copula and the imperfective suffix -/aːn/ added to the verb stem. The various copula forms agree with their subject according to gender and number, and are provided below with the verb /jun/ (to come): 

Past tense in Kashmiri is significantly more complex than the other tenses, and is subdivided into three past tense distinctions. The simple (sometimes called proximate) past refers to completed past actions. Remote past refers to actions that lack this in-built perfective aspect. Indefinite past refers to actions performed a long time ago, and is often used in historical narrative or storytelling contexts.

As described above, Kashmiri is a split-ergative language; in all three of these past tense forms, the subjects of transitive verbs are marked in the ergative case and direct objects in the nominative. Intransitive subjects are marked in the nominative. Nominative arguments, whether subjects or objects, dictate gender, number and person marking on the verb.

Verbs of the simple past tense are formed via the addition of a suffix to the verb stem, which usually undergoes certain uniform morphophonemic changes. First and third person verbs of this type do not take suffixes and agree with the nominative object in gender and number, but there are second person verb endings. The entire simple past tense paradigm of transitive verbs is illustrated below using the verb /parun/ (&quot;to read&quot;):

A group of irregular intransitive verbs (&quot;special intransitives&quot;), take a different set of endings in addition to the morphophonemic changes that affect most past tense verbs.

Intransitive verbs in the simple past are conjugated the same as intransitives in the indefinite past tense form.

In contrast to the simple past, verb stems are unchanged in the indefinite and remote past, although the addition of the tense suffixes does cause some morphophonetic change. Transitive verbs are declined according to the following paradigm:


As in the simple past, &quot;special intransitive&quot; verbs take a different set of endings in the indefinite and remote past:


Regular intransitive verbs also take a different set of endings in the indefinite and remote past, subject to some morphophonetic variation:


Future tense intransitive verbs are formed by the addition of suffixes to the verb stem:

The future tense of transitive verbs, however, is formed by adding suffixes that agree with both the subject and direct object according to number, in a complex fashion:

====Aspect====
There are two main aspectual distinctions in Kashmiri, perfective and imperfective. Both employ a participle formed by the addition of a suffix to the verb stem, as well as the fully conjugated auxiliary /aːsun/ (&quot;to be&quot;)—which agrees according to gender, number and person with the object (for transitive verbs) or the subject (for intransitive verbs).

Like the auxiliary, the participle suffix used with the perfective aspect (expressing completed or concluded action) agrees in gender and number with the object (for transitive verbs) or subject (for intransitives) as illustrated below:

The imperfective (expressing habitual or progressive action) is simpler, taking the participle suffix -/aːn/ in all forms, with only the auxiliary showing agreement. A type of iterative aspect can be expressed by reduplicating the imperfective participle.

===Pronouns===
Pronouns are declined according to person, gender, number and case, although only third person pronouns are overtly gendered. Also in third person, a distinction is made between three degrees of proximity, called proximate, remote I and remote II.




There is also a dedicated genitive pronoun set, in contrast to the way that the genitive is constructed adverbially elsewhere. As with future tense, these forms agree with both the subject and direct object in person and number.

===Adjectives===
There are two kinds of adjectives in Kashmiri, those that agree with their referent noun (according to case, gender and number) and those that are not declined at all. Most adjectives are declined, and generally take the same endings and gender-specific stem changes as nouns. The declinable adjective endings are provided in the table below, using the adjective (&quot;red&quot;):

Among those adjectives not declined are adjectives that end in - or -, adjectives borrowed from other languages, and a few isolated irregulars.

The comparative and superlative forms of adjectives are formed with the words (&quot;more&quot;) and (&quot;most&quot;), respectively.

===Numerals===

Within the Kashmir language, numerals are separated into cardinal numbers and ordinal numbers. These numeral forms, as well as their aggregative (both, all the five, etc.), multiplicative (two times, four times, etc.), and emphatic forms (only one, only three, etc.) are provided by the table below.

:: The ordinal number &quot;1st&quot; which is for its masculine gender and for its feminine gender is also known as and respectively.

==Vocabulary==
Kashmiri is an Indo-Aryan language and was heavily influenced by Sanskrit, especially early on. After the arrival of Islamic administrative rule in India, Kashmiri acquired many Persian loanwords. In modern times, Kashmiri vocabulary has imported words from
English, Hindustani and Punjabi.

===Preservation of old Indo-Aryan vocabulary===
Kashmiri retains several features of Old Indo-Aryan that have been lost in other modern Indo-Aryan languages such as Hindi-Urdu, Punjabi and Sindhi. Some vocabulary features that Kashmiri preserves clearly date from the Vedic Sanskrit era and had already been lost even in Classical Sanskrit. This includes the word-form &quot;yodvai&quot; (meaning &quot;if&quot;), which is mainly found in Vedic Sanskrit texts. Classical Sanskrit and modern Indo-Aryan use the word &quot;yadi&quot; instead.

===First person pronoun===
Both the Indo-Aryan and Iranian branches of the Indo-Iranian family have demonstrated a strong tendency to eliminate the distinctive first person pronoun (&quot;I&quot;) used in the nominative (subject) case. The Indo-European root for this is reconstructed as *eǵHom, which is preserved in Sanskrit as &quot;aham&quot; and in Avestan Persian as &quot;azam&quot;. This contrasts with the &quot;m-&quot; form (&quot;me&quot;, &quot;my&quot;) that is used for the accusative, genitive, dative, ablative cases. Sanskrit and Avestan both used forms such as &quot;ma(-m)&quot;. However, in languages such as Modern Persian, Baluchi, Hindi and Punjabi, the distinct nominative form has been entirely lost and replaced with &quot;m-&quot; in words such as &quot;ma-n&quot; and &quot;mai&quot;. However, Kashmiri belongs to a relatively small set that preserves the distinction. &#x27;I&#x27; is &quot;ba/bi/bo&quot; in various Kashmiri dialects, distinct from the other &quot;me&quot; terms. &#x27;Mine&#x27; is &quot;myon&quot; in Kashmiri. Other Indo-Aryan languages that preserve this feature include Dogri (&quot;aun&quot; vs &quot;me-&quot;), Gujarati (&quot;hu-n&quot; vs &quot;ma-ri&quot;), Konkani (&quot;hā̃v&quot; vs &quot;mhazo&quot;), and Braj (&quot;hau-M&quot; vs &quot;mai-M&quot;). The Iranian Pashto preserves it too (&quot;za&quot; vs. &quot;maa&quot;), as well as Nuristani languages, such as Askunu (&quot;âi&quot; vs &quot;iũ&quot;).

===Variations===
There are very minor differences between the Kashmiri spoken by Hindus and Muslims. For &#x27;fire&#x27;, a traditional Hindu uses the word while a Muslim more often uses the Arabic word .

== Sample text ==

=== Perso-Arabic script ===
Art. 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights:

&quot;All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&quot;

=== Sharada script ===
Verses by Lalleshwari:

&quot;I kept reciting the unique divine word &quot;Om&quot; and kept it safe in my heart through my resolute dedication and love. I was simply ash and by its divine grace got metamorphosed into gold.&quot;

One who recites the divine word &quot;Omkār&quot; by devotion is capable to build a bridge between his own and the cosmic consciousness. By staying committed to this sacred word, one doesn&#x27;t require any other mantra out of thousands others.

<text>Polyarny () is a town and the administrative center of the closed administrative-territorial formation of Alexandrovsk in Murmansk Oblast, Russia, situated on the outermost western side of the Kola Bay. Population: 

It was previously known as &quot;Alexandrovsk&quot; (until 15 March 1926), &quot;Alexandrovskoye&quot; (until 11 March 1931), &quot;Polyarnoye&quot; (until 19 September 1939).

==History==
It was founded in 1896 and named Alexandrovsk () in honor of Tsar Alexander III. Other sources, however, state that the original name was Alexandrovsk-na-Murmane (), it was called so after Alexandra Fyodorovna, wife of Emperor Nicholas II, and did not become known as &quot;Alexandrovsk&quot; until later.

Town status was granted to it on 1899. At the same time, Alexandrovsk became an uyezd town, for which reason Kolsky Uyezd was renamed Alexandrovsky.

On 3 May 1920 the Alexandrovskaya Volost Executive Committee divided the territory of the volost into six selsoviets, including Alexandrovsky Selsoviet with the administrative center in Alexandrovsk. However, the Murmansky Uyezd Executive Committee&#x27;s did not approve the creation of all six selsoviets, with Alexandrovsky Selsoviet being one which did not get an approval.

On 16 October 1925, when the Murmansk Governorate Commission meeting initiated work on compiling lists of the urban and rural localities — Murmansk, Alexandrovsk, and Kola were categorized as urban; however, a recommendation was sent to the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) to demote the latter two to rural localities due to economic conditions, sparse population, low trade volume, lack of industrial enterprises, and &quot;general regression&quot;. On 9 January 1926 the assembly of the town residents created Alexandrovsky Selsoviet and on 15 March 1926, when the VTsIK approved the recommendation to demote the towns, Alexandrovsk and Kola were re-categorized as rural localities. At the same time the name was unofficially changed to Alexandrovskoye ().

On 12 January 1931 the Third Congress of the Soviets of Alexandrovsky District issued a resolution, renaming the district &quot;Polyarny&quot;; at the same time the village of Alexandrovskoye was renamed Polyarnoye (). On 5 March 1931 the new name of the district was approved by the administrative commission of the Leningrad Oblast Executive Committee, and on 11 March 1931 by its Presidium. While the Presidium of the VTsIK never officially gave a final approval for this renaming, &quot;de facto&quot; the name has changed.

In 1934, the Murmansk Okrug Executive Committee unsuccessfully petitioned to grant town status to Polyarnoye and to rename it Krasnoflotsk. Town status, however, was not granted to Polyarnoye until 19 September 1939, when it was at the same time renamed Polyarny.

By the 14 June 1956 Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR, Polyarny was demoted in status to that of a town under district jurisdiction and subordinated to Polyarny District. By the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR of 9 July 1960, Polyarny District was abolished and the town of Polyarny was administratively subordinated to Severomorsk. Finally, by the 17 June 1983 Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR Decree, the town was elevated in status to that of a town under oblast jurisdiction, and by the 10 August 1983 Decision of the Murmansk Oblast Executive Committee, several inhabited localities previously subordinated to Severomorsk were transferred to it.
==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Polyarny serves as the administrative center of the closed administrative-territorial formation of Alexandrovsk—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts—to which it is directly subordinated. Within the framework of municipal divisions, the town of Polyarny is a part of Alexandrovsk Urban Okrug.

==Military==
Since the 1930s Polyarny has had naval significance. Russian Shipyard Number 10 (&quot;Shkval&quot;) is located in Polyarny, and in the West is more often referred to by the name of the town than by its official name. As the first nuclear-powered submarines were delivered to the Northern Fleet at the end of the 1950s, the yard was modified for docking and repair of these vessels. As Soviet (and now Russian) naval nuclear vessels are decommissioned, they are laid up at Polyarny to await defuelling and disposal.

==Honors==
In a presidential decree dated 5 May 2008 the town of Polyarny was awarded the title of City of Military Glory.

<text>Metro International is a Swedish media company based in Luxembourg that publishes the freesheet newspaper &quot;Metro&quot;.

The company was founded by Per Andersson, and started as a subsidiary of the Modern Times Group along with Viasat Broadcasting. It is now controlled through the Mats Qviberg-owned-investment company Custos. The first edition of the newspaper was published as &quot;Metro Stockholm&quot; and distributed in the Stockholm metro. , all European editions (except for the Hungarian one) have been sold.

==&quot;Metro&quot; newspapers==

, there were 56 daily editions in 15 languages and in 19 countries across Europe, North and South America, and Asia, for an audience of more than 17 million daily readers and 37 million weekly readers.

&quot;Metro&quot; newspaper editions are distributed in high-traffic commuter zones or in public transport networks via a combination of self-service racks and by-hand distributors on weekdays. Saturday editions are published in Stockholm, Santiago, São Paulo, and Lima. The distribution points are located in high-density population areas.

Metro International launched several editions in Canada in 2000, leading to the creation of several commuter newspaper competitors, such as Sun Media&#x27;s &quot;24 Hours&quot;.

The local name of &quot;Metro&quot; newspaper editions sometimes vary due to trademark issues. Peruvian, Chilean, and Mexican editions are called &quot;Publimetro&quot;, and the Spanish edition is called &quot;Metro Directo&quot;.

Not all newspapers named &quot;Metro&quot; are part of the Metro International Group. Associated Newspapers publishes another freesheet called &quot;Metro&quot; in twelve areas around Britain. This UK &quot;Metro&quot; is not related to Metro International, which used the name &quot;Morning News&quot; for its (now defunct) free sheet distributed there. However, Metro International and Associated Metro collaborated on the Dublin &quot;Metro Herald&quot; newspaper (launched 10 October 2005), which they both own a third of, along with &quot;The Irish Times&quot;. The Dublin Metro newspaper uses the Associated Metro logo and format, however. It is reported that Metro International has plans to launch a rival-free evening newspaper in London.

There are also other examples of newspapers named Metro that are not part of Metro International Group. In Belgium, Mass Transit Media, a joint venture of Concentra and Rossel, publishes the free daily newspaper &quot;Metro&quot;. In California, United States, &quot;Metro Silicon Valley&quot; is a free weekly newspaper founded in 1985. Neither of these newspapers have links to Metro International.
In Hong Kong, Metro International sold &quot;Metro Daily&quot; in 2013 to a local businessman.

===Timeline of &quot;Metro&quot; editions===
* &quot;Metro&quot; was first launched in Stockholm on 13 February 1995.
* The first international edition was launched in Budapest, Hungary in Hungarian (1998) and became the most popular daily with 400.000 daily edition. The newspaper had two editions, in the countryside and in Budapest. The popular Metro - later renamed as Metropol - was sold to a Hungarian private editor in 2011 and became a target of political fights. The newspaper was closed in 2015. On 7 September 2020, the daily restarted with the British Metro look and the same name, renaming the pro-government tabloid Lokál.
* A German-language edition is published in Switzerland by Metro Publication (Schweiz) AG under the name &quot;Metropol&quot; on 31 January 2000 as a direct competitor to &quot;20 Minuten&quot;. The newspaper ceased publication without announcement on 13 February 2002.

* At the end of 2006, Metro started a dedicated technology paper, Metro Teknik (English section) which is distributed weekly to companies, science parks, and technical universities around Sweden.
* Due to financial difficulties in the press sector in general, and the free press in particular, Metro International closed down its Polish edition on 5 January 2007. Earlier, the Danish afternoon version of the newspaper was closed down, and the business in Finland was sold.
* As of October 2008, the Croatian &quot;Metro&quot; edition was also cancelled, due to disappointing advertorial income.

Kirundi is mutually intelligible with Kinyarwanda, the national language of Rwanda, and the two form parts of the wider dialect continuum known as Rwanda-Rundi.

Kirundi is natively spoken by the Hutu, including Bakiga and other related ethnicities, as well as Tutsi, Twa and Hima among others have adopted the language. Neighbouring dialects of Kirundi are mutually intelligible with Ha, a language spoken in western Tanzania.

Kirundi is one of the languages where Meeussen&#x27;s rule, a rule describing a certain pattern of tonal change in Bantu languages, is active.

In 2020, the Rundi Academy was established to help standardize and promote Kirundi. 

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
Although the literature on Rundi agrees on 5 vowels, the number of consonants can vary anywhere from 19 to 26 consonants. The table below is compiled from a survey of academic acceptance of Rundi consonants.
===Vowels===
The table below gives the vowel sounds of Rundi.
All five vowels occur in long and short forms. The distinction is phonemic.

===Tone===
Rundi is a tonal language. There are two essential tones in Rundi: high and low (or H and L). Since Rundi has phonemic distinction on vowel length, when a long vowel changes from a low tone to a high tone it is marked as a rising tone. When a long vowel changes from a high tone to a low tone, it is marked as a falling tone.

Rundi is often used in phonology to illustrate examples of Meeussen&#x27;s rule In addition, it has been proposed that tones can shift by a metrical or rhythmic structure. Some authors have expanded these more complex features of the tonal system noting that such properties are highly unusual for a tone system.

===Phonotactics===
Syllable structure in Rundi is considered to be CV, that is having no clusters, no coda consonants, and no complex vowel nuclei. It has been proposed that sequences that are CVV in the surface realization are actually CV in the underlying deep structure, with the consonant coalescing with the first vowel.

===Consonant harmony===
Rundi has been shown to have properties of consonant harmony particularly when it comes to sibilants. Meeussen described this harmony in his essay and it is investigated further by others. One example of this harmony is triggered by and and targets the set of and in preceding adjacent stem syllables.

== Official use ==

Kirundi was recognized an official language in Burundi by the 1962 Constitution of the Kingdom of Burundi. In accordance with the constitution, many Burundian government orders, especially those printed in the &quot;Bulletin Officiel du Burundi&quot; from 1962 to 1963, were written in both French and Kirundi. After the constitution was suspended in 1966, Kirundi remained a &quot;de facto&quot; official language in the country, though its use in government documents declined. In 1972 Kirundi was adopted as the official language of instruction in Burundian primary schools.

<text>Highways in Australia are generally high capacity roads managed by state and territory government agencies, though Australia&#x27;s federal government contributes funding for important links between capital cities and major regional centres. Prior to European settlement, the earliest needs for trade and travel were met by narrow bush tracks, used by tribes of Indigenous Australians. The formal construction of roads began in 1788, after the founding of the colony of New South Wales, and a network of three major roads across the colony emerged by the 1820s. Similar road networks were established in the other colonies of Australia. Road construction programs in the early 19th century were generally underfunded, as they were dependent on government budgets, loans, and tolls; while there was a huge increase in road usage, due to the Australian gold rushes. Local government authorities, often known as Road Boards, were therefore established to be primarily responsible for funding and undertaking road construction and maintenance. The early 1900s saw both the increasingly widespread use of motorised transportation, and the creation of state road authorities in each state, between 1913 and 1926. These authorities managed each state&#x27;s road network, with the main arterial roads controlled and maintained by the state, and other roads remaining the responsibility of local governments. The federal government became involved in road funding in the 1920s, distributing funding to the states. The depression of the 1930s slowed the funding and development of the major road network until the onset on World War II. Supply roads leading to the north of the country were considered vital, resulting in the construction of Barkly, Stuart, and Eyre Highways.

The decades following the war saw substantial improvements to the network, with freeways established in cities, many major highways sealed, development of roads in northern Queensland and Western Australia under the Beef Cattle Roads Grants Acts, and interstate routes between Sydney and Melbourne upgraded. In 1974, the federal government assumed responsibility for funding the nations most important road links, between state and territory capitals cities, which were declared National Highways. Some sections of the National Highway system were no more than dirt tracks, while others were four lane dual carriageways. The network was gradually improved, and by 1989, all gravel road sections had been sealed. In the following decades, the National Highway system was amended through legislation, and was eventually superseded in 2005 by the broader National Land Transport Network, which included connections to major commercial centres, and intermodal freight transport facilities.

The first route marking system was introduced in the 1950s by the Conference of State Road Authorities, which later became the National Association of Australian State Road Authorities (NAASRA) and then Austroads. National Routes were assigned to significant interstate routes &quot;which, both now and in the future, comprise the more important arteries of road communications throughout Australia in all its aspects&quot;. East–west routes were planned to have even numbers, increasing from south to north, while north–south routes would have odd numbers, with numbers increasing from east to west. National Route 1 would be an exception, as a &quot;circumferential route along the coastline of Australia&quot;. A state route marking systems was designed to supplement the national system, for inter-regional and urban routes within states. Each state could choose their own numbering scheme, as long as National Route and State Route numbers were not duplicated in the same state, or nearby routes in another state. When the National Highway system was introduced, National Routes along it became National Highway routes with the same numbers, but with distinctive green and gold route markers. During the 1990s, planning began for a new alphanumeric route system. Alphanumeric routes have been introduced in most states and territories in Australia, partially or completely replacing the previous systems.

==History==

The earliest needs for trade and travel were met by narrow bush tracks, used by tribes of Indigenous Australian prior to European settlement. The formal construction of roads began in 1788, after the founding of the colony of New South Wales. These roads were little more than cleared paths, constructed without grading, drainage systems, and road surfaces. There was no system wide planning for roads, with the Surveyor-General&#x27;s 1788 proposed town plan dismissed as being too ostentatious; however, the arrival of Governor Macquarie in 1810 led to a planned system for roads and bridges, prior to actual settlement of areas, financed from government funds, public subscription, and tolls. By the end of his term in 1822, the colony had a network of three major roads, with the Great Western Road as the most important link, traversing the Blue Mountains from Sydney to Bathurst. Similar road networks were established in the other colonies of Australia.

Road construction programs in the early 19th century were generally underfunded, as they were dependent on government budgets, loans, tolls and public subscription. This problem was exacerbated by the huge increase in road usage, due to the Australian gold rushes. Local government authorities were therefore established as authorities primarily responsible for funding and undertaking road construction and maintenance. The increasing amount of motorised transportation in the early 1900s lead to another major increase in traffic levels. The vehicles also required higher standard of roads. State road authorities were established in each state between 1913 and 1926. These authorities managed each state&#x27;s road network, with the main arterial roads controlled and maintained by the state, and other roads remaining the responsibility of local governments. Though legislation differed in each state, highways were generally established as a subset of state controlled roads, which were the most important links between major cities, towns, and regional centres.

The federal government became involved in road funding in the 1920s. The Public Works Act was passed in 1922, which distributed $500,000 to the states according to population levels, conditional on states matching funding on a &quot;dollar for dollar basis&quot;. The funds were specifically aimed at maintenance of roads outside of metropolitan cities, and state expenditure needed federal government approval; however, the primary purpose of the act was to reduce unemployment.
The Main Roads Development Act of 1923 made $1 million available for road construction, and specific road projects were funded under the Federal Aid Roads Act of 1926. The 1931 Federal Aid Roads Act removed matching conditions, and were less restrictive on the way the money was used due to poor economic conditions resulting from the depression of the 1930s. Funding conditions remained at this lower level until 1959.

The depression of the 1930s slowed the funding and development of the major road network until the onset on World War II. Supply roads leading to the north of the country were considered vital, leading to the construction of Barkly, Stuart, and Eyre highways. Over 960 kilometres of the Stuart Highway, from Tennant Creek to Darwin, was upgraded from an often impassable track to an all-weather sealed highway that could cope with heavy military traffic. The Eyre Highway across the Nullarbor was formed just by grading the surface material.

The decades following the war saw substantial improvements to the network, with freeways established in cities, many major highways sealed, development of roads in northern Queensland and Western Australia under the Beef Cattle Roads Grants Acts. The interstate routes between Sydney and Melbourne were upgraded with the first four lane dual carriageway section of the Hume Highway opening in 1961, and the completed sealing of the Princes Highway between the two cities in 1966. Large mining developments in the Pilbara region of Western Australia were undertaken lead to the improvement of the North West Coastal Highway from Carnarvon to Port Hedland, a project that involved building 30 bridges in a decade.

In 1974, the federal government assumed responsibility for funding the nations most important road links. Under the National Roads Act 1974, the most important roads between state and territory capitals cities were declared National Highways. The federal government fully funded construction and maintenance works undertaken by the states on these roads. The of roads included in the original National Highway system varied greatly in quality. Some sections were no more than dirt tracks, whilst others were four lane dual carriageways. While was sealed, there was also of gravel roads. The National Highway was gradually improved, with the sealed proportion increased from 73 per cent in the early 1970s to 88 per cent by 1981. The sealing works were completed in 1989.

In 1988, the National Highway became redefined under the Australian Land Transport Development (ALTD) Act of 1988, which had various amendments up to 2003. The 1988 Act also defined a category of &quot;Road of National Importance&quot;, which were partly funded by federal government.
The Introduction of the AusLink (National Land Transport) Act in 2005 superseded the National Highway and Roads of National Importance classifications, which were replaced by the National Land Transport Network. The criteria for inclusion in the network was similar to the previous legislation, but expanded to include connections to major commercial centres, and inter-modal freight transport facilities. All of the roads included in National Land Transport Network as of 2005 were formally defined by regulation in October 2005. Auslink has since been replaced with subsequent legislation under the federal government&#x27;s Nation Building Program, which includes the National Land Transport Network. The National Highways road routes developed under the former system are still designated as National Highways on route markers and road guidance signs. However, the new alphanumeric route numbering system introduced to New South Wales and the ACT in 2013 does not distinguish between the former National Highways and other routes. VicRoads have, as of September 2013, similarly deprecated the National Highway route marker in favour of standard routes.

==Route numbering systems==
Roads routes in Australia assist drivers navigating roads throughout the country, by identifying important through-routes. The first route marking system was introduced to Australia in the 1950s. National Routes were assigned to significant interstate routes – the most important road links in the country. National Route 1 was designated to a circular route around the Australian coastline. A state route marking system was designed to supplement the national system, for inter-regional and urban routes within states. When the National Highway system was introduced, National Routes along it became National Highway routes with the same numbers, but with distinctive green and gold route markers. Alphanumeric routes were introduced in Tasmania in 1979, and during the 1990s, planning began for nationally consistent route markings, using the alphanumeric system. Alphanumeric routes have been introduced in most states and territories in Australia, partially or completely replacing the previous systems.

===National Routes and Highways===

In 1955, the Australian National Route Numbering System was introduced to simplify navigation across Australia. The National Route Numbers are marked by white shields that are present in directional signs, distance signs or trailblazers. The general rule was that odd-numbered highways travel in north–south directions and even-numbered highways in east–west directions, with only a few exceptions. National Route 1 was assigned to a network of highways and roads, which together linked all capital cities and coastal towns circumnavigating the mainland. The National Route system initially linked the centres of towns and cities and terminated at the junction of other national routes, however many bypasses have been constructed since then. National Routes often terminated at the metropolitan city limits rather than the individual city centres.

In 1974, the federal government assumed responsibility for funding the nations most important road links, with the introduction of the National Highway. These highways were marked with distinctive green and gold route marker shields instead of the plain National Route shield. Though the National Highway system has been superseded in subsequent legislation, National Highway route markers are still used on many of the routes. Additionally, National Highways and National Routes have been phased out, or are in the process of being phased out, in all states and territories except Western Australia, in favour of the alphanumeric system.

===State Routes===
Important urban and inter-regional routes not covered by the National Highway or National Route systems are marked under the State Route system. They can be recognised by blue shield markers. They were practically adopted in all states by the end of the 1980s, and in some states, some less important National Routes were downgraded to State Routes. Each state has or had its own numbering scheme, but do not duplicate National Route numbers in the same state, or nearby routes in another state.
As with the National Routes and National Highways, State Routes are being phased out in most states and territories in favour of alphanumeric routes. However, despite the fact that Victoria has fully adopted alphanumeric routes in regional areas, state route numbers are still used extensively within the city of Melbourne as a part of its Metropolitan Route Numbering Scheme.

===Metroads===

In the 1990s in Sydney and Brisbane, urban route numbering system were streamlined under the Metroad scheme. Metroad route numbers were assigned to the key navigational corridors, along ring and radial routes, and marked by distinctive hexagonal shields. Most Metroads have been partially replaced with alphanumeric routes in Brisbane, and they have been completely replaced in Sydney.

===Alphanumeric routes===
Tasmania introduced an alphanumeric route numbering system in 1979, based on the British system from 1963. The new system aimed to upgrade the signing of destinations, including previously unmarked roads, and to simplify navigation by allowing visitors to follow numbered routes. National Highway 1 was retained as the only route without an alphanumeric designation.
In the 1990s Victoria and South Australia also overhauled their systems. While South Australia discarded the National and State Route Numbering Systems, those shield-based schemes were retained in the Melbourne metropolitan area as the Metropolitan Route Numbering Scheme. The route numbers used in the alphanumeric schemes were generally inherited from the original National Route Numbering System, with only a few exceptions, and prefixed with letters denoting their grade. For example, Western Freeway is M8 until Ballarat and continues beyond as A8 Western Highway. They are not used extensively in the Melbourne metropolitan area where the blue-shield metropolitan route system is retained for most routes. The National Highways were retained, until 2013, but with the route numbers changed to alphanumeric designations.

New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory introduced the alphanumeric system from early 2013. Before being officially announced, new road signs were fitted with such numbers and then being &quot;coverplated&quot; with the existing route number. However, the new system does not distinguish between the former National Highways and other routes.

Alphanumeric routes have also been introduced for many major highways and urban routes in Queensland, although many other roads retain markers from the National Route, National Highway, State and Metroad numbering systems. According to the New South Wales Roads and Maritime Services, the Northern Territory has similarly begun converting their numbered routes to alphanumeric routes, with a &quot;progressive replacement&quot; scheme that sees alphanumeric route markers introduced only when signs are replaced. At this stage, 4 routes have been fully signed while another one is missing the prefix letter in all of its signs. While there are no immediate plans to introduce an alphanumeric route numbering system in Western Australia, it will begin converting once additional funds become available in the future.

====Prefix letters====
In the alphanumeric systems, a letter denoting the route&#x27;s construction standard and function is prefixed to the route number, creating an alphanumeric route designation. One of six letters may be used:
* &quot;M&quot; routes are primary traffic routes, called motorways in some states. These are typically dual carriageway, freeway-standard highways, but may also be used for rural roads that are nearly at freeway-standard, or at least are dual carriageways.
* &quot;A&quot; routes are other primary highways, including urban arterials and interstate or interregional single carriageways.
* &quot;B&quot; routes are less significant routes, either as an alternative to an &quot;A&quot; or &quot;M&quot; route, or linking smaller population centres to larger regional centres, but without being a major through-route in the region. These are the major road links in areas without &quot;A&quot; routes.
* &quot;C&quot; routes link smaller settlements and towns to the rest of the major road network. They are used for roads without the significance of an &quot;M&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, or &quot;B&quot; route, but where numbering would assist navigation.
* &quot;D&quot; routes are detour routes. These are only used in New South Wales with only two routes and 
* &quot;R&quot; routes are ring routes only used in South Australia with only one route 
* &quot;ALT A&quot; routes are alternative &quot;A&quot; routes only used in Queensland

==Classification==
Australia&#x27;s major roads are managed by the states and territories. While some state road authorities use a road hierarchy with Highway as the highest classification, the classification of state-controlled roads varies between states, with differing classification names, definitions, and number of levels in the hierarchy. Road names do not necessarily correspond to classifications – for example, Great Southern Highway is not classified as a highway. A highway, or other classification level, may be composed of multiple named roads, and a single road name may have varying classifications along its length. Internal numbering schemes for such classifications do not necessarily relate to designated road routes – for example, Great Western Highway is Highway 5 for administrative purposes but is signposted as part of route A32.

===Australian Capital Territory===
The ACT classifies its roads into four groups, depending on its physical properties and role within the road network:
*Arterial roads: These roads serve long-distance travellers within or between districts, and support large volumes of traffic. They may be limited access, or controlled-access. A small number of these roads have relatively high levels of property access due to city design requirements at the time.
*Major collector roads: These roads serve local area traffic distributing to or from minor collector roads, and also link to the arterial network. Well designed property access is permissible.
*Minor collector roads: These roads serve neighbourhood traffic, and provide access from the major collector roads into residential areas. Normal direct property access is permissible at this level. Secondary links to the arterial network are possible.
* Access streets: These streets are the lowest road type in the hierarchy, and provide access to the bulk of residential homes.

===New South Wales===
In New South Wales, sections 46, 47, 50 and 51 of the Roads Act 1993 provide for the classifications of Highway, Main Road, Secondary Road or Tourist Road.

===Northern Territory===
In the Northern Territory, major roads are classified into three categories: National Highway, Arterial Roads, and Secondary Roads.

===Queensland===
In Queensland, roads are classified as: National Network Roads, State Strategic Roads, Regional Roads, or District Roads.

===South Australia===
South Australia&#x27;s Department of Planning, Transport and Infrastructure (DPTI) classifies state-controlled roads into three categories: National Land Transport Network; DPTI Maintained Road, Sealed; and DPTI Maintained Road, Unsealed.

===Tasmania===
In Tasmania, the most important state and regional connections, totalling , are state-owned roads, which are further classified into a road hierarchy.
The hierarchy consists of:
* Trunk roads – major highways which are the &quot;primary freight and passenger roads&quot;
* Regional freight roads – regional roads which connect heavy freight to the trunk roads
* Regional access roads – providing access to Tasmania&#x27;s Regions, with less traffic than trunk and regional freight roads
* Feeder roads – connect population centres and tourist traffic to and from the rest of the state road network
* Other roads – lower traffic roads, primarily providing access to private properties

===Victoria===
In Victoria, major roads are designated as either freeways (including tollways) or arterial roads (including other tolled roads), under section 17 subsection 1 of the Road Management Act 2004, and under the same act, section 14 subsection 1, VicRoads is named as the controlling authority in designating major roads as either freeways or arterial roads.

===Western Australia===
In Western Australia, roads controlled and maintained by the state road authority, Main Roads Western Australia, are either highways or Main Roads. Any road or section of road may be proclaimed a highway by the Governor of Western Australia, on the recommendation of the Commissioner of Main Roads, under Section 13 of the Main Roads Act 1930. Section 14 of the act allows for the creation of new highways.
As well as this legal classification scheme, Main Roads Western Australia also classifies roads by the following functional hierarchy:
* Primary Distributor: Provide for major regional and inter-regional traffic movement and carry large volumes of generally fast moving traffic. They are managed by Main Roads Western Australia.
* Regional Distributor: Roads that are not primary distributors, but which link significant destinations and are designed for efficient movement of people and goods within and beyond regional areas. They are managed by local government.
* District Distributor: Roads that run between built up area land-use cells and generally not through them, forming a grid which would ideally space them about 1.5 kilometres apart. They are managed by local government.
* Local Distributor: Roads that carry traffic within a cell and link district distributors or primary distributors at the boundary, to access roads. The route of local distributors should discourage through traffic so that the cell formed by the grid of higher order distributor roads, only carries traffic belonging to, or serving the area. In rural areas local distributors connect to other rural distributors and to rural access roads.
* Access Road: Provide access to abutting properties with safety aspects having priority over the vehicle movement function. In urban areas, these roads are bicycle and pedestrian friendly, with aesthetics and amenity also important. Access roads are managed by local government.
Other classifications processes exist for planning, administrative, financial, and asset management purposes.

==Federally funded highways==
The federal government contributes funding for the following road links, which make up the national road network, under the Nation Building Program.
*Sydney to Melbourne – Hume Highway/Freeway/Motorway 
*Sydney to Brisbane – the Pacific Motorway (Sydney–Newcastle), New England and Cunningham Highways route and the Pacific Highway route

<doc id="371350" wikidata="Q3307433" url="?curid=371350" title="Metro (British newspaper)">
<text>Metro is a British freesheet tabloid newspaper published by DMG Media. The newspaper is distributed from Monday to Friday mornings on public places in areas of England, Wales and Scotland (excluding public holidays and the period between Christmas Eve and New Year&#x27;s Day inclusive). Copies are also handed out to pedestrians. In 2018, Metro overtook &quot;The Sun&quot; to become the most circulated newspaper in the United Kingdom.

&quot;Metro&quot; is owned by Daily Mail and General Trust plc (DMGT), part of the same media group as the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;, but in some areas &quot;Metro&quot; operates as a franchise with a local newspaper publisher, rather than as a wholly owned concern. While being a sister paper to the conservative &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, the newspaper has never endorsed any political party or candidate, and says it takes a neutral political stance in its reporting.

==History==
===Origins and London launch ===
The &quot;Metro&quot; free newspaper concept originated in Sweden, where a publication of the same name was launched in 1995 by Metro International. British newspaper executives Jonathan Harmsworth and Murdoch MacLennan, from DMGT, were reportedly inspired by the idea and flew to Stockholm on a &#x27;fact-finding mission&#x27; to develop their version. There were also reports in the late 1990s that both Metro International and Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News International were considering launching free newspapers in the UK that might prove a commercial threat to DMGT&#x27;s businesses.

DMGT subsequently launched &quot;Metro&quot;, using the same name as Metro International&#x27;s publications but with a different logo, on Tuesday 16 March 1999. This UK version of &quot;Metro&quot; had no relation to Metro International or its sister newspapers in other countries. &quot;Metro&quot; was launched initially as a London-only newspaper with an original print run of 85,000 copies, which were distributed via dedicated bins in London Underground stations. The newspaper was produced at DMGT&#x27;s printworks and office complex at Surrey Quays in southeast London, away from the company&#x27;s main newspaper office in Kensington, west London.

===National expansion===
In the years following its launch, the paper&#x27;s distribution was gradually expanded to other major UK cities, including Manchester and Birmingham. By February 2003, &quot;Metro&quot; had become operationally profitable for the first time. Its reach was extended further in 2004, becoming available in more urban areas, including Nottingham, Sheffield, Bristol and Bath.

&quot;Metro&quot;″s circulation continued to rise in the following years, though readership temporarily dipped after the 7 July 2005 London bombings. There was a 1.8% decline – the equivalent of around 9,000 readers – in copies picked up in the weeks following the attacks due to a reduction in the number of people using London&#x27;s public transport network, coupled with the temporary closure of some London Underground lines where &quot;Metro&quot; was distributed.

Following several years of expansion, in 2006 the newspaper&#x27;s production was moved to DMGT&#x27;s main newspaper offices at Northcliffe House in Kensington, west London. That same year the newspaper expanded further, launching in Cardiff and Liverpool in joint venture deals with Trinity Mirror.

At the time of its tenth anniversary in 2009, the newspaper was distributed in sixteen &quot;major&quot; UK cities and its circulation had grown to 1.3 million. Despite the increase in readership, that same year, management also closed five regional &quot;Metro&quot; offices in Manchester, Glasgow, Newcastle, Birmingham, and Bristol, which were responsible for producing regionalised arts, entertainment, and food pages, citing &quot;challenging economic conditions&quot;.

By 2011, &quot;Metro&quot;″s distribution network had expanded to more than 50 cities in the UK. In that year media commentator Roy Greenslade said the publication was now making &quot;bumper profits&quot; and – mistakenly, as it is not national – dubbed it &quot;Britain&#x27;s most successful national newspaper&quot;.

===Launch of Irish edition===
&quot;Metro Ireland&quot; was launched in Dublin on 10 October 2005. It followed a legal battle over the title&#x27;s name with the publishers of the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; and Dublin&#x27;s &quot;Evening Herald&quot;, which launched its free newspaper called &quot;Herald AM&quot;. Both titles were loss-making, despite having a combined circulation of 145,000 in the Greater Dublin Area. On 2 July 2009, it was announced that the two freesheets would merge under the &quot;Metro&quot; banner, an operation completed by 2010. However, the Irish edition was closed down in December 2014.

===London 2012 Olympic Games===
For the first time in its history, &quot;Metro&quot; temporarily published seven days a week during the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Paralympics, providing free copies to spectators at the Games as well as the general public. The newspaper struck a reported £2.25 million deal with sportswear manufacturer Adidas to run cover wrap adverts on each of the 17 days of the Olympics.

===Rising circulation===
After more than a decade in charge, editor Kenny Campbell was replaced as editor by Ted Young in 2014. Young&#x27;s appointment coincided with several changes at the newspaper, including the separation of the print and online editions, along with an expansion of &quot;Metro&quot;″s distribution in the UK.

In November 2016, comedian Richard Herring stepped down from writing his weekly column for &quot;Metro&quot;. Fellow TV comedian Dom Joly later replaced him in the slot.

In 2017, &quot;Metro&quot; became the most-read newspaper in the UK, according to monthly National Readership Survey figures. In March 2018, &quot;Metro&quot; officially overtook &quot;The Sun&quot; in total print circulation, according to ABC (Audit Bureau of Circulations (UK)) figures.

===2023 restructure===
During the COVID-19 pandemic &quot;Metro&quot; suffered financial losses from reduced advertising during travel disruptions and cost increases. In 2023 the newsroom was restructured into one team for both print and online led by editor-in-chief Deborah Arthurs, resulting in some redundancies including editor Ted Young. In 2024 it was profitable in both print and online.

==Content==
===Print edition===
The majority of the newspaper&#x27;s content is produced at Northcliffe House in Kensington, west London. There are no regional editions within England and Wales, except for occasional differences in sports and arts content catered to specific local audiences. A separate, small team produces a Scottish edition of &quot;Metro&quot;; however, often the only substantial difference between the two versions is the front page.

The newspaper comprises three main categories: news, features and sport. The news section includes &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot;, which typically contains one to four pages of showbiz and entertainment news; letters pages; and a page dedicated to business news. A popular feature of the letters pages is Rush-Hour Crush, in which readers send in anonymous messages to fellow users of public transport who they consider attractive. The column has led to at least one marriage. The news section also features occasional feature columns from political pundits such as Sophy Ridge of Sky News. However, while offering analysis, these columns do not typically express endorsements of political positions or candidates, thus not being considered as op-ed columns as in other newspapers.

The features section contains a mix of articles on travel, homes, style, health and science, as well as arts coverage and entertainment listings. The puzzles page currently features a crossword and Sudoku.

===Online===
&quot;Metro&quot; launched a website version of the newspaper in July 2001. Between 2001 and 2014 most print edition articles were published on this website, along with additional online-only content such as blogs and opinion columns.

In 2014 production of the newspaper and the website were separated. As a result, from 2014 &quot;Metro&quot; newspaper and &quot;Metro Online&quot; were produced by separate organisations and written independently by different editorial teams while remaining part of the same parent company. Deborah Arthurs was appointed Editor of &quot;Metro.co.uk&quot; in 2014, following her time as Femail Editor for &quot;MailOnline&quot;. 

In February 2021, the newspaper&#x27;s separate website metro.news was abolished and merged back with metro.co.uk. Separate editorial teams continue to produce content for the website and print editions. 

== Competition ==
&quot;Metro&quot; has faced competition in parts of the UK from other free newspapers, along with rivalry from paid-for national titles. Former editor Ted Young used to say that his &#x27;mantra&#x27; was to produce a newspaper that its readers would be willing to pay for.

Metro International attempted to launch its own UK edition in 1999, being distributed in Newcastle upon Tyne&#x27;s Tyne &amp; Wear Metro system competing with DMGT&#x27;s &quot;Metro&quot;. After battling alongside each other with the same name, Metro International&#x27;s &quot;Metro&quot; changed its name to &quot;Morning News&quot;. This attempt was short-lived, however, and &quot;Morning News&quot; was discontinued shortly afterwards.

In 2005, Rupert Murdoch said he was worried by competition from &quot;Metro&quot; and that it had damaged the circulation of his newspaper the &quot;Sun&quot;. He told a press conference he was watching the free newspaper market &quot;keenly and apprehensively&quot;. Murdoch&#x27;s News International subsequently launched a London-based evening freesheet in 2006 called &quot;The London Paper&quot;. This was closed on 18 September 2009.

&quot;London Lite&quot; was another free evening newspaper published in London. It operated only from 2006 to 2009; it was owned by the same parent company as &quot;Metro&quot;, and was seen as a &quot;spoiler&quot; to protect against the commercial threat from &quot;The London Paper&quot;.

Another rival is the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot;, which became a freesheet in 2009, though unlike &quot;Metro&quot; it is only published in the London region.

== App products ==
&quot;Metro&quot; launched two new mobile app products in 2016: &quot;11versus11&quot;, which is a football news app, and &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot;, a celebrity news app. Both apps offer personalised content based on a user&#x27;s interest profile.

== Controversies ==
In the run-up to the 2015 United Kingdom general election, the then UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage declined to be interviewed by &quot;Metro&quot;, accusing them of bias against his party. This was denied by the newspaper&#x27;s editor. All other national party leaders agreed to be interviewed, including Conservative prime minister David Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband.

Before the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, &quot;Metro&quot; published a cover-wrap advert on behalf of the Leave campaign, paid for by the Democratic Unionist Party. The following day, the newspaper published another cover-wrap advert, this time from the Remain campaign. Editor Ted Young said both adverts, which each cost more than £250,000 to place, generated around 300 complaints each, accusing the newspaper of both pro- and anti-Brexit bias. Concerns were subsequently raised over why the Democratic Unionist Party placed an advert in &quot;Metro&quot; because the newspaper does not publish in Northern Ireland.

In May 2019, the paper was condemned by the National Union of Journalists and the Public and Commercial Services Union, after an internal document leaked to &quot;The Guardian&quot; showed evidence that Amber Rudd, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, had authorised the use of at least £250,000 of public money for a ten-week run of advertorials to be placed in &quot;Metro&quot; newspapers to &quot;challenge the myths&quot; around the government&#x27;s controversial Universal Credit programme. The Trussell Trust also ran a counter-campaign called &quot;Universal Credit Uncovered&quot;. In June 2019, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reported that 80 UK charities had filed a complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority over &quot;misleading Universal Credit adverts in &quot;Metro&quot;&quot;. In July 2019, the Advertising Standards Authority announced it was launching an investigation into the DWP ads. On 5 November 2019, the Advertising Standards Authority ruled that the campaign was misleading, branding the ads &quot;exaggerated&quot; and in some cases &quot;unsubstantiated&quot;. The Advertising Standards Authority upheld three complaint points whilst partially upholding a fourth.

<doc id="371351" wikidata="Q329659" url="?curid=371351" title="Christian anarchism">
<text>Christian anarchism is a Christian movement in political theology that claims anarchism is inherent in Christianity and the Gospels. It is grounded in the belief that there is only one source of authority to which Christians are ultimately answerable—the authority of God as embodied in the teachings of Jesus. It therefore rejects the idea that human governments have ultimate authority over human societies. Christian anarchists denounce the state, believing it is violent, deceitful and idolatrous.

Christian anarchists hold that the &quot;Kingdom of God&quot; is the proper expression of the relationship between God and humanity. Under the &quot;Kingdom of God&quot;, human relationships would be characterized by horizontal organization, servant leadership, and universal compassion—not through the traditional structures of organized religion, which most Christian anarchists consider hierarchical and/or authoritarian structures. Most Christian anarchists are also pacifists who reject war, militarism, and the use of violence.

More than any other Bible source, the Beatitudes are used as a basis for Christian anarchism. Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;The Kingdom of God Is Within You&quot; is often regarded as a key text for modern Christian anarchism.

== Origins ==
=== Old Testament ===
Jacques Ellul, a French philosopher and Christian anarchist, notes that the final verse of the Book of Judges (Judges 21:25) states that there was no king in Israel and that &quot;everyone did as they saw fit&quot;. Subsequently, as recorded in the first Book of Samuel (1 Samuel 8) the people of Israel wanted a king &quot;so as to be like other nations&quot;.

God declared that the people had rejected him as their king. He warned that a human king would lead to militarism, conscription and punitive taxation, and that their pleas for mercy from the king&#x27;s demands would go unanswered. Samuel passed on God&#x27;s warning to the Israelites but they still demanded a king, and Saul became their ruler. Much of the subsequent Old Testament chronicles the Israelites trying to live with this decision.

=== New Testament ===

More than any other Bible source, the Sermon on the Mount is used as the basis for Christian anarchism. explains that the Sermon perfectly illustrates Jesus&#x27;s central teaching of love and forgiveness. Christian anarchists claim that the state, founded on violence, contravenes the Sermon and Jesus&#x27; call to love one&#x27;s enemies.

The gospels tell of Jesus&#x27;s temptation in the desert. For the final temptation, Jesus is taken up to a high mountain by Satan and told that if he bows down to Satan he will give him all the kingdoms of the world. Christian anarchists use this as evidence that all Earthly kingdoms and governments are ruled by Satan, otherwise they would not be Satan&#x27;s to give. Jesus refuses the temptation, choosing to serve God instead, implying that Jesus is aware of the corrupting nature of Earthly power.

Christian eschatology and various Christian anarchists, such as Jacques Ellul, have identified the state and political power as the Beast in the Book of Revelation.

Friedrich Nietzsche and Frank Seaver Billings criticize Christianity and anarchism by arguing that they are the same thing.

=== Early Church ===
According to Alexandre Christoyannopoulos, several of the Church Fathers&#x27; writings suggest anarchism as God&#x27;s ideal. The first Christians opposed the primacy of the state: &quot;We must obey God as ruler rather than men&quot; (Acts 4:19, 5:29, 1 Corinthians 6:1-6); &quot;Stripping the governments and the authorities bare, he exhibited them in open public as conquered, leading them in a triumphal procession by means of it.&quot; (Colossians 2:15). Also, some early Christian communities appear to have practised anarchist communism, such as the Jerusalem group described in Acts, who shared their money and labour equally and fairly among the members. Roman Montero claims that using an anthropological framework, such as that of the anarchist David Graeber, one can plausibly reconstruct the communism of the early Christian communities and that the practices were widespread, long-lasting, and substantial. Christian anarchists, such as Kevin Craig, insist that the communities were centred on true love and care for one another, rather than liturgy. They also allege that the reason for the early Christians were persecuted was not that they worshipped Jesus Christ but that they refused to worship human idols claiming divine status (see Imperial cult). Since they refused to worship the Roman Emperor, they refused to swear any oath of allegiance to the Roman Empire. 

In his introduction to a translation of the &quot;Sayings of the Desert Fathers&quot;, Thomas Merton describes the early monastics as &quot;Truly in certain sense &#x27;anarchists&#x27;, and it will do no harm to think of them as such.&quot;

=== Conversion of the Roman Empire ===

For Christian anarchists, the moment that epitomised the degeneration of Christianity was the conversion of Emperor Constantine after his victory at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312. Christianity was then legalized under the Edict of Milan in 313, which hastened the Church&#x27;s transformation from a humble bottom-up sect to an authoritarian top-down organization. Christian anarchists point out that marked the beginning of the &quot;Constantinian shift&quot; in which Christianity gradually came to be identified with the will of the ruling elite by becoming the state church of the Roman Empire and in some cases (such as the Crusades, Inquisition, and the French Wars of Religion) a religious justification for violence.

=== Peasant revolts in the Post-Reformation era ===
Various libertarian socialist authors have identified the written work of the English Protestant social reformer Gerrard Winstanley and the social activism of his group, the Diggers, as anticipating their line of thought. For the anarchist historian George Woodcock, &quot;Although (Pierre Joseph) Proudhon was the first writer to call himself an anarchist, at least two predecessors outlined systems that contain all the basic elements of anarchism. The first was Gerrard Winstanley (1609–1676), a linen draper who led the small movement of the Diggers during the Commonwealth. Winstanley and his followers protested in the name of a radical Christianity against the economic distress that followed the Civil War and against the inequality that the grandees of the New Model Army seemed intent on preserving.

In 1649–1650, the Diggers squatted on stretches of common land in southern England and attempted to set up communities based on work on the land and the sharing of goods. The communities failed following a crackdown by the English authorities, but a series of pamphlets by Winstanley survived, of which &quot;The New Law of Righteousness&quot; (1649) was the most important. Advocating a rational Christianity, Winstanley equated Christ with &quot;the universal liberty&quot; and declared the universally corrupting nature of authority. He saw &quot;an equal privilege to share in the blessing of liberty&quot; and detected an intimate link between the institution of property and the lack of freedom. For Murray Bookchin, &quot;In the modern world, anarchism first appeared as a movement of the peasantry and yeomanry against declining feudal institutions. In Germany its foremost spokesman during the Peasant Wars was Thomas Müntzer; in England, Gerrard Winstanley, a leading participant in the Digger movement. The concepts held by Müntzer and Winstanley were superbly attuned to the needs of their time – a historical period when the majority of the population lived in the countryside and when the most militant revolutionary forces came from an agrarian world. It would be painfully academic to argue whether Müntzer and Winstanley could have achieved their ideals. What is of real importance is that they spoke to their time; their anarchist concepts followed naturally from the rural society that furnished the bands of the peasant armies in Germany and the New Model in England.&quot;

=== Modern era ===

The 19th-century Christian abolitionists Adin Ballou and William Lloyd Garrison were critical of all human governments and believed that they would be eventually supplanted by a new order in which individuals are guided solely by their love for God. Ballou and Garrison advocated Christian nonresistance to evil, as they saw Christ as the embodiment of &quot;passive nonresistance&quot;, or nonviolent praxis against the state. They both condemned violence against southern slave owners and advocated instead for moral suasion or consistent rebukes against the institution of slavery in efforts to persuade racist southerns and indifferent northerners to the abolitionist&#x27; cause. At the outbreak of the Civil War, however, Garrison later embraced the armed struggle for black liberation and the Lincoln administration. Ballou remained a lifelong pacifist and condemned the Civil War for fear of the eventual retaliation by white southerns on freed black Americans.

Ballou&#x27;s and Garrison&#x27;s writings heavily influenced Leo Tolstoy, who was inspired by their lifelong commitment to abolitionism. Tolstoy wrote extensively on his burgeoning Christian anarchist principles in nonfiction books like &quot;The Kingdom of God is Within You&quot;, which is considered a key Christian anarchist text. Tolstoy sought to separate Russian Orthodox Christianity, which was merged with the state, from what he believed was the true message of Jesus as contained in the Gospels, specifically in the Sermon on the Mount. He took the viewpoint that all governments that wage war and churches that in turn support those governments, are an affront to the Christian principles of nonviolence. Although Tolstoy never actually used the term &quot;Christian anarchism&quot; in &quot;The Kingdom of God Is Within You&quot;, reviews of the book after its publication in 1894 appear to have coined the term.
Thomas J. Hagerty, a Marxist Catholic priest turned oculist, was a primary author of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) Preamble (&quot;an injury to one is an injury to all&quot;). IWW members included Christian anarchists like Dorothy Day and Ammon Hennacy.

Dorothy Day was a journalist turned social activist who became known for her social justice campaigns in defense of the poor. Alongside Peter Maurin, she founded the Catholic Worker Movement in 1933, which espoused nonviolence and hospitality for the impoverished and the downtrodden. Day was declared Servant of God when a cause for sainthood was opened for her by Pope John Paul II. Day&#x27;s distributist economic views are very similar to Proudhon&#x27;s mutualism by which she was influenced. Day also named the phrase &quot;precarious work&quot; based on the former anarchocommunist Léonce Crenier&#x27;s embrace of poverty. Peter Maurin&#x27;s vision to transform the social order consisted of establishing urban houses of hospitality to care for the destitute, rural farming communities to teach city dwellers agrarianism and encourage a movement back to the land, and roundtable discussions in community centres to clarify thought and initiate action.

Simone Weil was a French philosopher who was very early animated by a great compassion for the exploited. She was first a socialist and then an anarchist. In 1930s, she converted to &quot;love of Christ&quot;. During her experience, she explains that she suddenly felt that Christianity was the religion of the slaves and that she, like other slaves, could not resist adhering to it. She is considered a &quot;Christian mystic&quot; and an &quot;anarchist Christian&quot;.

== Anarchist biblical views and practices ==
=== Church authority ===
With some notable exceptions such as the Catholic Worker Movement, many Christian anarchists are critical of Church dogma and rituals. Christian anarchists tend to wish that Christians were less preoccupied with performing rituals and preaching dogmatic theology, and more with following Jesus&#x27; teaching and practices. Jacques Ellul and Dave Andrews claim that Jesus did not intend to be the founder of an institutional religion, while Michael Elliot believes one of Jesus&#x27; intentions was to bypass human intermediaries and do away with priests.

=== Pacifism and nonviolence ===

Christian anarchists, such as David Lipscomb, Leo Tolstoy, Ammon Hennacy, Jacques Ellul, and Dave Andrews, follow Jesus&#x27; call to not resist evil but turn the other cheek. They argue that this teaching can only imply a condemnation of the state, as the police and army hold a monopoly over the legitimate use of force. They believe freedom will only be guided by the grace of God if they show compassion to others and turn the other cheek when confronted with violence. Christian anarchists believe violence begets violence and the ends never justify the means.
Many Christian anarchists practice the principles of nonviolence, nonresistance, and turning the other cheek. To illustrate how nonresistance works in practice, Alexandre Christoyannopoulos offers the following Christian anarchist response to terrorism:
=== Simple living ===

Christian anarchists such as Ammon Hennacy, Peter Maurin and Dorothy Day often advocate voluntary poverty. This can be for a variety of reasons, such as withdrawing support for government by reducing taxable income or following Jesus&#x27; teachings. Jesus appears to teach voluntary poverty when he told his disciples, &quot;It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God&quot; (Mark 10:25) and &quot;You cannot serve both God and Mammon&quot; (Luke 16:13).

=== State authority ===
The most common challenge for anarchist theologians is interpreting Paul&#x27;s Epistle to the Romans 13:1–7, in which Paul demanded obedience to governing authorities and described them as God&#x27;s servants exacting punishment on wrongdoers. Romans 13:1–7 holds the most explicit reference to the state in the New Testament but other parallel texts include Titus 3:1, Hebrews 13:17 and 1 Peter 2:13-17.
Some theologians, such as C.E.B. Cranfield, have interpreted Romans 13:1–7 to mean the Church should support the state, as God has sanctified the state to be his main tool to preserve social order. Similarly, in the case of the state being involved in a &quot;just war&quot;, some theologians argue that it&#x27;s permissible for Christians to serve the state and wield the sword. Christian anarchists do not share these interpretations of Romans 13 but still recognize it as &quot;a very embarrassing passage.&quot;

Christian anarchists and pacifists such as Jacques Ellul and Vernard Eller do not attempt to overthrow the state given Romans 13 and Jesus&#x27; command to turn the other cheek. As wrath and vengeance are contrary to the Christian values of kindness and forgiveness, Ellul neither supports, nor participates in, the state. Eller articulates this position by restating the passage this way:
Christians who interpret Romans 13 as advocating support for governing authorities are left with the difficulty of how to act under tyrants or dictators. Ernst Käsemann, in his &quot;Commentary on Romans&quot;, challenged the mainstream Christian interpretation of the passage in light of German Lutheran Churches using this passage to justify the Holocaust.

Paul&#x27;s letter to Roman Christians declares &quot;For rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do wrong.&quot; However Christian anarchists point out an inconsistency if this text were to be taken literally and in isolation as Jesus and Paul were both executed by the governing authorities or &quot;rulers&quot; even though they did &quot;right.&quot; 

There are also Christians anarchists such as Leo Tolstoy and Ammon Hennacy, who favor Jesuism and do not see the need to integrate Paul&#x27;s teachings into their subversive way of life. Tolstoy believed Paul was instrumental in the church&#x27;s &quot;deviation&quot; from Jesus&#x27; teaching and practices whilst Hennacy believed &quot;Paul spoiled the message of Christ&quot;. In contrast to Eller, Hennacy and Ciaron O&#x27;Reilly advocate nonviolent civil disobedience to confront state oppression.

=== Swearing of oaths ===
In the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:33-37), Jesus tells his followers to not swear oaths in the name of God or Man. Tolstoy, Adin Ballou and Petr Chelčický understand this to mean that Christians should never bind themselves to any oath as they may not be able to fulfil the will of God if they are bound to the will of a fellow-man. Tolstoy takes the view that all oaths are evil, but especially an oath of allegiance.

=== Tax ===
Some Christian anarchists resist taxes in the belief that their government is engaged in immoral, unethical or destructive activities such as war, and paying taxes inevitably funds these activities, whilst others submit to taxation. Adin Ballou wrote that if the act of resisting taxes requires physical force to withhold what a government tries to take, then it is important to submit to taxation. Ammon Hennacy, who, like Ballou also believed in nonresistance, eased his conscience by simply living below the income tax threshold.

Christian anarchists do not interpret the injunction in Matthew 22:21 to &quot;give to Caesar what is Caesar&#x27;s&quot; as advocating support for taxes, but as further advice to free oneself from material attachment. For example, Dorothy Day said if we were to give everything to God there will be nothing left for Caesar, and Jacques Ellul believed the passage showed that Caesar may have rights over fiat money but not things that are made by God, as he explained:
=== Vegetarianism ===

Vegetarianism in the Christian tradition has a long history commencing in the first centuries of Church with the Desert Fathers and Desert Mothers who abandoned the &quot;world of men&quot; for intimacy with the God of Jesus Christ. Vegetarianism amongst hermits and Christian monastics in the Eastern Christian and Roman Catholic traditions remains common to this day as a means of simplifying one&#x27;s life, and as a practice of asceticism. Leo Tolstoy, Ammon Hennacy, and Théodore Monod extended their belief in nonviolence and compassion to all living beings through vegetarianism.

== Present-day Christian anarchist groups ==
=== Brotherhood Church ===
The Brotherhood Church is a Christian anarchist and pacifist community. The Brotherhood Church can be traced back to 1887 when a Congregationalist minister called John Bruce Wallace started a magazine called &quot;The Brotherhood&quot; in Limavady, Northern Ireland. An intentional community with Quaker origins has been located at Stapleton, near Pontefract, Yorkshire, since 1921.

=== Catholic Worker Movement ===

Established by Peter Maurin and Dorothy Day in the early 1930s, the Catholic Worker Movement is a Christian movement dedicated to nonviolence, personalism and voluntary poverty. Over 130 Catholic Worker communities exist in the United States where &quot;houses of hospitality&quot; care for the homeless. The Joe Hill House of hospitality (which closed in 1968) in Salt Lake City, Utah featured an enormous twelve feet by fifteen foot mural of Jesus Christ and Joe Hill. Present-day Catholic Workers include Ciaron O&#x27;Reilly, an Irish-Australian civil rights and anti-war activist.

Anne Klejment, professor of history at University of St. Thomas, wrote of the Catholic Worker Movement:

The Catholic Worker Movement has consistently protested against war and violence for over seven decades. Many of the leading figures in the movement have been both anarchists and pacifists, as Ammon Hennacy explains:
Maurin and Day were both baptized and confirmed in the Catholic Church and believed in the institution, thus showing it is possible to be a Christian anarchist and still choose to remain within a church. After her death, Day was proposed for sainthood by the Claretian Missionaries in 1983. Pope John Paul II granted the Archdiocese of New York permission to open Day&#x27;s cause for sainthood in March 2000, calling her a Servant of God.

In literature, in Michael Paraskos&#x27;s 2017 novel, &quot;Rabbitman&quot;, a political satire prompted by Donald Trump&#x27;s presidency, the heroine, called Angela Witney, is a member of an imagined Catholic Worker commune located in the southern English village of Ditchling, where the artist Eric Gill once lived.

=== Doukhobors ===
=== Online communities ===

Numerous Christian anarchist websites, social networking sites, forums, electronic mailing lists and blogs have emerged on the internet over the last few years. These include: The AnarchoChristian Podcast and Website, Biblical Anarchy: Obey God Rather Than Men, The Libertarian Christian Institute, started by Norman Horn, &quot;A Pinch of Salt&quot;, a 1980s Christian anarchist magazine, revived in 2006 by Keith Hebden as a blog and bi-annual magazine; Libera Catholick Union founded in 1988 and re-organized in 2019; &quot;Jesus Radicals&quot; founded by Mennonites in 2000; &quot;Lost Religion of Jesus&quot; created in 2005; &quot;Christian Anarchists&quot; created in 2006; &quot;The Mormon Worker&quot;, a blog and newspaper, founded in 2007 to promote Mormonism, anarchism and pacifism; and &quot;Academics and Students Interested in Religious Anarchism&quot; (ASIRA) founded by Alexandre Christoyannopoulos in 2008.

== Criticism ==
Critics of Christian anarchism include both Christians and anarchists. Christians often cite Romans 13 as evidence that the state should be obeyed, while secular anarchists reject belief in any authority including God. The latter often denounce religious dogma through use of the slogan &quot;no gods, no masters&quot;. Christian anarchists often believe Romans 13 is taken out of context, emphasizing that Revelation 13 and Isaiah 13, among other passages, are needed to fully understand the meaning of Romans 13 text.

<text>Arthur Lee Conley (January 4, 1946 – November 17, 2003), also known in later years as Lee Roberts, was an American soul singer, best known for the 1967 hit &quot;Sweet Soul Music&quot;.

==Early life==
Conley was born in McIntosh County, Georgia, U.S., and grew up in Atlanta. He first recorded in 1959 as the lead singer of Arthur &amp; the Corvets. With this group, he released three singles in 1963 and 1964—&quot;Poor Girl&quot;, &quot;I Believe&quot;, and &quot;Flossie Mae&quot;—on the Atlanta-based record label, NRC Records.

==Biography and career==
In 1964, he moved to a new label (Baltimore&#x27;s Ru-Jac Records) and released &quot;I&#x27;m a Lonely Stranger&quot;. When Otis Redding heard this, he asked Conley to record a new version, which was released on Redding&#x27;s own fledgling label Jotis Records, as only its second release. Conley met Redding in 1967. Together they rewrote the Sam Cooke song &quot;Yeah Man&quot; into &quot;Sweet Soul Music&quot;, which, at Redding&#x27;s insistence, was released on the Atco-distributed label Fame Records, and was recorded at FAME studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. It proved to be a massive hit, going to the number two position on the U.S. charts and the Top Ten across much of Europe. &quot;Sweet Soul Music&quot; sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.

After several years of hit singles in the early 1970s, he relocated to England in 1975, and spent several years in Belgium, settling in Amsterdam (Netherlands) in spring 1977. At the beginning of 1980 he had some major performances as Lee Roberts and the Sweaters in the Ganzenhoef, Paradiso, De Melkweg and the Concertgebouw, and was highly successful. At the end of 1980 he moved to the Dutch town of Ruurlo legally changing his name to Lee Roberts—his middle name and his mother&#x27;s maiden name. He promoted new music via his Art-Con Productions company. Among the bands he promoted was the heavy metal band Shockwave from The Hague. A live performance on January 8, 1980, featuring Lee Roberts &amp; the Sweaters, was released as an album entitled &quot;Soulin&quot; in 1988.

==Personal life==
Conley was gay, and several music writers have said that his homosexuality was a bar to greater success in the United States and one of the reasons behind his move to Europe and his eventual name change. In 2014, rock historian Ed Ward wrote, &quot;[Conley] headed to Amsterdam and changed his name to Lee Roberts. Nobody knew &#x27;Lee Roberts,&#x27; and at last Conley was able to live in peace with a secret he had hidden—or thought he had—for his entire career: he was gay. But nobody in The Netherlands cared.&quot;

==Death==
Conley died at the age of 57 from intestinal cancer in Ruurlo, The Netherlands in November 2003. He was buried in Vorden.

<doc id="371358" wikidata="Q145971" url="?curid=371358" title="Zampogna">
<text>Zampogna (, , ) is a generic term for a number of Italian double chantered bagpipes that can be found throughout areas in Abruzzo, Latium, Molise, Basilicata, Campania, Calabria, Apulia, Sicily, and as far north as the southern part of the Marche. The tradition is now mostly associated with Christmas, and the most famous Italian carol, &quot;Tu scendi dalle stelle&quot; (You Come Down From the Stars) is derived from traditional &quot;zampogna&quot; music. However, there is an ongoing resurgence of the instrument in secular use seen with the increasing number of folk music festivals and folk music ensembles.
==Construction==
All chanters and drones are fixed into a single round stock that the bag is attached to. Each chanter is tuned differently, according to the tradition it represents, and there are dozens. Typically, the double-reeded versions (Marche, Abruzzo, Latium, Campania, southern Basilicata and parts of Sicily and southern Calabria) will have a soprano chanter on the right and a bass chanter on the left (called, respectively, &quot;ritta&quot; and &quot;manga&quot;—meaning &#x27;right&#x27; and &#x27;left&#x27;—in the tradition of Southern Latium) with an alto drone (&quot;bordone&quot; being the generic name); but as many as three drones, the other tuned above and below the basic chord can be used, or, in the case of the Marches tradition, no drones at all.
The single reed versions consist of the &quot;surdullina&quot; types of the Province of Cosenza and Catanzaro, and the &quot;ciaramella&quot; or &quot;ciaramedda&quot; of Messina and Catania in Sicily, as well as in Southern Calabria. The &quot;surdullina&quot; is a very short chantered version of the instrument that is used to play tarantellas primarily, while the ciaramedda can play all of the traditional regional melodies the other types can.

The traditional reeds are made from stalks of the Giant Reed &quot;Arundo donax&quot;, called &quot;canna marina&quot; in Italian. The double reed versions may also be made from plastic. The single reeds are made from a single section of the cane.

Traditionally the bags are made from goat hides that are removed from the slaughtered animal in one piece, cured, turned inside out, then tied off just in front of the rear legs, one of the front legs serving to house the blow pipe with its simple leather valve (&quot;soffietto&quot;), and the other tied off. The typical round stock into which both chanters and drones are fixed goes into the neck of the skin. The hair is left on, and is contained in the inside of the bag (&quot;otre&quot;). Today, however, some pipers are substituting the traditional goat and sheep hide bags with a rubber inner tube or wintex which is covered with an artificial fleece. This practice of using the synthetic bag is particularly popular among the pipers from Scapoli in the Molise region, and those of Atina in Latium.

==Musical traditions==

The double reeded version of the &quot;zampogna&quot; is generally played with the piffero (called &quot;biffera&quot; in Lazio, or &quot;ciaramella&quot; or &quot;pipita&quot; in other regions; a shawm, or folk oboe), which plays the melody and the zampogna provides chord changes, &quot;vamping&quot; or rhythmic harmony figures or a bass line and a soprano harmony as accompaniment. This double reed tradition would include Central Italy (Latium, southern Abruzzo and Molise), that of southern Basilicata (Pollino) and nearby areas of Calabria, and some areas of Sicily (Syracuse, Palermo). Single reed versions are played solo in the Calabrian tradition of the &quot;surdullina&quot; (Cosenza), and a version with a plugged chanter called the &quot;surdullina albanese&quot;, and the Sicilian or &quot;ciaramella&quot; (Catania, Messina, and Reggio Calabria). The chanters and drones vary, according to the tradition, from a few inches long (surdullina) to nearly two meters in length, such as used in the cathedral of Monreale (Palermo) and nearly every size in between. The pipes are related to the Sardinian , a single reed &quot;triple clarinet&quot; comprising two chanters and a drone and played in the mouth by circular breathing.

==Etymology==
The word derives from the Latin &quot;symphonia&quot;. It is etymologically related to the Greek &quot;sumphōnía&quot; (), meaning &quot;concord or unison of sound&quot; (from &quot;syn-&quot;, &quot;with, together&quot; + &quot;phōnḗ&quot;, &quot;sound&quot;) and applied later to a type of bagpipe. It is a cognate of Greek &quot;tsampouna&quot;, the word for the Greek island bagpipe (itself a reborrowing of &quot;zampogna&quot;); Romanian , which means &quot;symphony&quot; or &quot;many sounds played together&quot;; Georgian ; and Spanish &quot;zampoña&quot;, which refers to Andean pan pipes.

==History==
*There is a bagpipe museum, the Museo della Zampogna in Scapoli, Molise.
*In 2010 a feature-length documentary about the zampogna was published entitled, &quot;Zampogna: The Soul of Southern Italy&quot;

<text>Latino sine flexione (&quot;Latin without inflections&quot;), Interlingua de Academia pro Interlingua (IL de ApI) or Peano&#x27;s Interlingua (abbreviated as IL) is an international auxiliary language compiled by the Academia pro Interlingua under the chairmanship of the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932) from 1887 until 1914. It is a simplified version of Latin, and retains its vocabulary. Interlingua-IL was published in the journal &quot;Revue de Mathématiques&quot; in an article of 1903 entitled &quot;De Latino Sine Flexione, Lingua Auxiliare Internationale&quot; (meaning &quot;On Latin Without Inflection, International Auxiliary Language&quot;), which explained the reason for its creation. The article argued that other auxiliary languages were unnecessary, since Latin was already established as the world&#x27;s international language. The article was written in classical Latin, but it gradually dropped its inflections until there were none.

Language codes ISO 639: ISO 639-2 and -1 were requested on 23 July 2017 at the Library of Congress (proposed: &quot;IL&quot; and &quot;ILA&quot;); ISO-639-3 was requested on 10 August 2017 at SIL (proposed: &quot;ILC&quot;) and was rejected on 23 January 2018.

== History ==

In 1903, Peano published the article &quot;De Latino Sine Flexione&quot; to introduce his language. In this work, Peano quoted a series of suggestions by Leibniz about a simplified form of Latin. The article appeared to be a serious development of the idea, and Peano subsequently gained a reputation among the auxiliary language movement.

In 1904, Peano undertook an essay about the way to obtain the minimal grammar of an eventual minimal Latin (&quot;Latino minimo&quot;), with a minimal vocabulary purely international.

Peano and some colleagues published articles in Latino sine flexione for several years at the &quot;Revue de Mathématiques&quot;. Because of his desire to prove that this was indeed an international language, Peano boldly published the final edition of his famous Formulario mathematico in Latino sine flexione. However, as Hubert Kennedy notes, most mathematicians were put off by the artificial appearance of the language, and made no attempt to read it.

In October 1907, Peano was at the Collège de France in Paris to take part in the Delegation for the Adoption of an International Auxiliary Language. Having declared for Latino sine flexione to be adopted, he eventually could not participate in the final voting, because of labour affairs at Turin.

On 26 December 1908, Peano was elected member and director of the &quot;Akademi internasional de lingu universal&quot; still using Idiom Neutral, which was refounded one year later under the name Academia pro Interlingua. Every academician might use their favourite form of Interlingua, the term being initially used in a general sense as a synonym for international language, yet it soon began to be specially used to denote a reformed Latino sine flexione based on the common rules the academicians were reaching by frequent votings. Thus, the name Interlingua soon began to denote the language evolving from the Academia Pro Interlingua, with the corresponding abbreviation &quot;IL&quot;.

However, every member was free to write in their own personal style, and indeed some members were proposing radical reforms which eventually might end up as independent languages (like Michaux&#x27;s Romanal or De Wahl&#x27;s Interlingue). For this reason, the name &quot;Peano&#x27;s Interlingua&quot; or &quot;Interlingua (IL)&quot; might be regarded as the most accurate for the particular standard by Peano. (As found in &quot;Interglossa and its predecessors&quot;.)

The discussions to reach a standard Interlingua may be seen on the pages of &quot;Discussiones&quot;, the official journal of the Academia pro Interlingua from 1909 to 1913. This and subsequent journals of the academy have been recently published in a CD-Rom by the mathematics department of the University of Turin, the place where Peano developed his teaching and research.

Since &quot;De Latino Sine Flexione&quot; had set the principle to take Latin nouns either in the ablative or nominative form (&quot;nomen&quot; was preferred to &quot;nomine&quot;), in 1909 Peano published a vocabulary in order to assist in selecting the proper form of every noun, yet an essential value of Peano&#x27;s Interlingua was that the lexicon might be found straightforward in any Latin dictionary (by getting the thematic vowel of the stem from the genitive ending, that is: &quot;-a -o -e -u -e&quot; from &quot;-ae -i -is -us -ei&quot;).
Finally, a large vocabulary with 14,000 words was published in 1915.

A reformed Interlingua was presented in 1951 by Alexander Gode as the last director of the International Auxiliary Language Association. It was claimed to be independent from Peano&#x27;s Interlingua, because it had developed a new method to detect the &quot;most recent common prototypes&quot;. But that method usually leads to the Latin ablative, so most vocabulary of Peano&#x27;s Interlingua would be kept. Accordingly, the very name &quot;Interlingua&quot; was kept, yet a distinct abbreviation was adopted: &quot;IA&quot; instead of &quot;IL&quot;.

== Alphabet and pronunciation ==

According to Peano&#x27;s guide to the language in 1931, &quot;most Interlinguists are in favour of the old Latin pronunciation.&quot; This gives the pronunciation of vowels as follows:

* a—as in father: 
* e—as in they: 
* i—as in feet: 
* o—as in tone: 
* u—as in rule: 
* y—as French u: 
* j—as in yes: 
* ae—as in eye: 
* oe—as in boy: 

Consonants are pronounced largely as in English, with the following clarifications:

* b—like English b, but like p if followed by s or t: 
* g—like g in go, get: 
* h—silent in rh otherwise like English h: 
* qu—as qu in quarrel: 
* r—as in corr (trilled): 
* v—like English w.: 
* x—as ks.: 
* ch, ph, th—as c, p, t in can, pan, tan: 
* c—like k always, as in scan, scat: (not aspirated)
* p—as in span
* t—as in stand

Not all consonants and vowels are pronounced distinctively by all people. The following variant pronunciations are allowed:

* y as 
* ae and oe as 
* h silent
* ch, ph, th as 
* ph as 
* v like English v, 
* w like English v

The stress is based on the classical Latin rule:

* Words with two syllables have the stress on the penult.
* Words with three or more syllables have the stress on the penult only if it is heavy (closed or had a long vowel in Classical Latin), otherwise on the antepenult (p. xii).
A secondary accent may be placed when necessary as the speaker deems appropriate.

== Parts of speech ==

Though Peano removed the inflections of Latin from nouns and adjectives, he did not entirely remove grammatical gender, permitting the option of a feminine ending for . The gender of animals is immutable. All forms of nouns end with a vowel and are taken from the ablative case, but as this was not listed in most Latin dictionaries, he gave the rule for its derivation from the genitive case. The plural is not required when not necessary, such as when a number has been specified, the plural can be read from the context, and so on; however, Peano gives the option of using the suffix -s to indicate it when needed. Verbs have few inflections of conjugation; tenses and moods are instead indicated by verb adjuncts. The result is a change to a positional language.

=== Particles ===

Particles that have no inflection in classical Latin are used in their natural form:

* &quot;Supra, infra, intra, extra&quot;... (but &quot;superiore, inferiore, interiore, exteriore&quot; from &quot;superior, -oris&quot; and so on.)
* &quot;Super, subter, inter, praeter, semper&quot;... (but &quot;nostro, vestro, dextro...&quot; from &quot;noster, -tra, -trum&quot; and so on.)
* &quot;Tres, quattuor, quinque, sex, septem, octo, novem, decem&quot;... (but &quot;uno&quot; from &quot;unus, -a, -um&quot;; &quot;duo&quot; from &quot;duo, -ae, -o&quot;; &quot;nullo&quot; from &quot;nullus, -a, -um&quot;; &quot;multo&quot; from &quot;multus, -a, -um&quot;, etc.)

=== Nouns ===

The form of nouns depends on the Latin declensions.

Those proper nouns written with the Roman alphabet are kept as close to the original as possible. The following are examples: München, New York, Roma, Giovanni.

=== Pronouns ===

* Personal

* Demonstrative: &quot;illo&quot; (that, as in &quot;that book&quot;), &quot;isto&quot; (this, as in &quot;this book&quot;), &quot;ipso&quot; (itself); for conjunction: &quot;que&quot; (&quot;me vide que illo es rapide&quot; = I see that it is fast)
* Possessive: &quot;meo&quot;, &quot;tuo&quot;, &quot;suo&quot;, &quot;nostro&quot;, &quot;vestro&quot;, (&quot;suo&quot;)
* Relative and conjunctive: &quot;qui&quot; (who, that human), &quot;quod&quot; (which, that thing)
* Reflexive: &quot;se&quot;
* Indefinitive: &quot;un&quot;, &quot;uno&quot; (&quot;One&quot; tells...), &quot;ullo&quot; (any), &quot;omne&quot; or &quot;omni&quot; (all, each, every), &quot;aliquo&quot; (anyone), &quot;nullo&quot; (nothing), &quot;nemo&quot; (no one)

=== Verbs ===

Verbs are formed from the Latin by dropping the final &quot;-re&quot; of the infinitive. Tense, mood, etc., are indicated by particles, auxiliary verbs, or adverbs, but none is required if the sense is clear from the context. If needed, the past may be indicated by preceding the verb with &quot;e&quot;, and the future with &quot;i&quot;.

There are specific endings to create the infinitive and participles:

* Basic form: ama (loves)
* Infinitive: amare (to love)
* Passive participle: amato (loved)
* Active participle: amante (loving)

==== Collateral endings ====

* Imperfectum (past): amaba (loved), legeba (read)
* Future: amarà (will/shall love), legerà (will/shall read)
* Conditional: amarè (would love), legerè (would read)

The endings &quot;-rà&quot; and &quot;-rè&quot; are stressed.

==== Compound tenses ====

Composite tenses can be expressed with auxiliary words:

* Praeteritum: habe amato (have loved)
* Future: debe amare / vol amare / habe ad amare (must love / will love / have to love)
* Continuous tenses: me es scribente (I am writing)

=== Adjectives and adverbs ===

Adjectives are formed as follows:

* If the nominative neuter ends with -e, the Latino form is unchanged.
* If the nominative neuter ends with -um, the Latino form is changed to -o: novum &gt; novo (new).
* In all other cases, adjectives are formed with the ablative case from the genitive, as is the case with nouns.

Adjectives can be used as adverbs if the context is clear, or &quot;cum mente&quot; or &quot;in modo&quot; can be used:

* Diligente (diligent): &quot;Cum mente diligente&quot;, &quot;cum diligente mente&quot;, &quot;in modo diligente&quot;, &quot;in diligente modo&quot; = diligently.

==== Comparative and superlative ====

* Positive: &quot;illo es tam habile quam te&quot; (he is as handy as you)
* Comparative: &quot;illo es magis habile quam te&quot; or &quot;illo es plus habile quam te&quot; (he is handier than you) and &quot;illo es minus habile quam te&quot; (he is less handy than you)
* Superlative: &quot;maxim de...&quot; and &quot;minim de...&quot;

==== Irregularities ====

* Bono: meliore: optimo
* Malo: pejore: pessimo
* Magno: majore: maximo
* Parvo: minore: minimo

=== Articles ===

As with Latin, neither the definite nor the indefinite article exists in Latino sine flexione. When necessary they may be translated with pronouns or words such as &quot;illo&quot; (it, that), &quot;isto&quot; or &quot;hoc&quot; (this), or &quot;uno&quot; (one):

* Da ad me libro = give me (the) book
* Da ad me hoc (isto) libro = give me this book
* Da ad me illo libro = give me that book
* Da ad me uno libro = give me a book
* Da ad me illo meo libro = give me that book of mine

== Criticism ==
Peano formally defended the maxim that &quot;the best grammar is no grammar&quot;, bearing in mind the example of Chinese. (In modern linguistics, counter to popular and Peano&#x27;s usage, &quot;grammar&quot; does not refer to morphological structures alone, but also to syntax and phonology, for example, which both Latino sine flexione and Chinese still have. In this sense, &quot;languages without grammar&quot; cannot exist.) According to Lancelot Hogben, Peano&#x27;s Interlingua still shares a major flaw with many other auxiliary languages, having &quot;either too much grammar of the wrong sort, or not enough of the right&quot;. (p. 10) Hogben argues that at least nouns and verbs should be easily distinguished by characteristic endings so that one can easily get an initial understanding of the sentence. Thus, in Peano&#x27;s Interlingua, the verbs might be given some specific, standardized verbal form, such as the infinitive, which is sufficient in the Latin indirect speech. Instead, the raw imperative is proposed in &quot;De Latino Sine Flexione&quot;:

According to Hogben, another handicap is the lack of a pure article, which might clearly indicate the nouns. Nevertheless, Peano occasionally suggested that &quot;illo&quot; (that) and &quot;uno&quot; (one) might be used as articles.

Once more according to Hogben, the syntax of Peano&#x27;s Interlingua remained conservative:

Reviewing the list of more widely known Latin titles, one might conclude that the sequence &quot;noun-adjective&quot; is the norm in Latin, yet the inverted sequence is also current. The ratio is over 2 to 1 in a list of Latin titles commented by Stroh. E.g. &quot;&quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;.
As for a sequence &quot;nominative-genitive&quot;, it may be the norm in Latin in a similar ratio. E.g. &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;&quot;. Indeed, the sequence &quot;nominative-genitive&quot; must always be the norm in Peano&#x27;s Interlingua, since the preposition &quot;de&quot; must introduce the genitive. Thus, &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; would turn into &quot;Principio Mathematico de Philosophia Naturale&quot;. Since the function of both the adjective and the genitive is often the same, one might infer that the sequence &quot;noun-adjective&quot; might always be the norm.

<doc id="371370" wikidata="Q152066" url="?curid=371370" title="Take That">
<text>Take That are an English pop group formed in Manchester in 1990. The group currently consists of Gary Barlow, Howard Donald and Mark Owen. The original line-up also featured Jason Orange and Robbie Williams. Barlow is the group&#x27;s lead singer and primary songwriter, with Owen and Williams initially providing backing vocals, and Donald and Orange serving primarily as dancers.

The group have had 28 top-40 singles, 20 top-10 and 17 top-5 singles on the UK Singles Chart, 12 of which have reached number one. They have also had nine number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart. Internationally, the band have had 56 number-one singles and 42 number-one albums. They have received eight Brit Awards, including Best British Group and Best British Live Act. In 2012 they received an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. According to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), Take That has been certified for sales of 14.4 million albums and 13.8 million singles in the UK.

Williams left the band in 1995, while the four remaining members completed their world tour and released a final single before splitting up in 1996. After filming a 2005 &quot;Take That: For the Record&quot; about the group and releasing a new greatest hits album, a four-piece Take That without Williams officially announced a 2006 reunion tour around the UK, entitled The Ultimate Tour. On 9 May 2006, it was announced that the group were set to record new material together once again. Their fourth studio album, &quot;Beautiful World&quot;, was released in 2006 and was followed up with &quot;The Circus&quot;, in 2008. The group achieved new success as a four-piece, scoring a string of chart hits across the UK and Europe while selling over 45 million records worldwide. Williams rejoined Take That in 2010 for the band&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;Progress&quot;. Released on 15 November of that year, it was the first album of new material to feature Take That&#x27;s original line-up since their 1995 album, &quot;Nobody Else&quot;. It became the fastest-selling album of the 21st century and the second-fastest-selling album in British history.

In 2014, the band recorded a seventh studio album, this time as a trio without Williams and Orange. The album, titled &quot;III&quot;, was released in November 2014 and became the band&#x27;s seventh number one. It was preceded by the single &quot;These Days&quot;, which became the band&#x27;s 12th number one single in the UK. In 2011, Take That set the new record for the fastest-selling tour of all time in the UK with Progress Live, beating the previous record set by their Circus Live Tour in 2009. At the 2011 Brit Awards they won Best British Group. In 2012, &quot;Forbes&quot; named them the fifth-highest-earning music stars in the world. The group performed at the London 2012 Olympic Games closing ceremony, playing &quot;Rule the World&quot; while the Olympic Flame was extinguished. In the same year, the Official Charts Company revealed the biggest-selling singles artists in British music chart history with Take That placed 15th overall, making them the most successful boy band in UK chart history. Four of their albums are listed in the best-selling albums of the millennium, with three of them among the 60 best-selling albums in UK chart history.

==History==

===1989–1990: Formation===
In 1989, Manchester-based Nigel Martin-Smith sought to create a British male vocal singing group modelled on New Kids on the Block. Martin-Smith&#x27;s vision, however, was to create a teen-oriented group that could appeal to multiple demographic segments within the music industry. Martin-Smith was then introduced to young singer-songwriter Gary Barlow, who had been performing in clubs since the age of 15. Impressed with Barlow&#x27;s catalogue of self-written material, Martin-Smith decided to build his new-look boy band around Barlow&#x27;s musical abilities. A campaign to audition young men with abilities in dancing and singing followed and took place in Manchester and other surrounding cities in 1990. At 22, Howard Donald was one of the oldest to audition, but was chosen after he got time off work as a vehicle painter to continue the process. A budding DJ, he and Barlow had a shared interest in electronic acts such as Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD) and Gary Numan. Prior to auditioning, Jason Orange had appeared as a breakdancer on the popular television programme &quot;The Hit Man and Her&quot;. Martin-Smith also selected 18-year-old bank employee Mark Owen and finally 16-year-old Robbie Williams to round out the group, which initially went by the name Kick It.

===1990–1992: &quot;Take That &amp; Party&quot;===
Take That&#x27;s first TV appearance was on &quot;The Hit Man and Her&quot; in 1990, where they performed Barlow&#x27;s self-written, unreleased song, &quot;My Kind of Girl&quot;. They later appeared a second time to perform &quot;Waiting Around&quot;, which would become the B-side for the first single, &quot;Do What U Like&quot;. &quot;Promises&quot; and &quot;Once You&#x27;ve Tasted Love&quot; were also released as singles but were minor hits in the UK. Take That initially worked the same territory as their American counterparts, singing new jack R&amp;B, urban soul, and mainstream pop. However, they worked their way toward Hi-NRG dance music, while also pursuing an adult contemporary ballad direction. As they aimed to break into the mainstream music industry, they worked a number of small clubs, schools, and events across the country building up a fanbase as they travelled to gigs constantly for months.

Take That&#x27;s breakthrough single was a cover of the 1975 Tavares hit &quot;It Only Takes a Minute&quot;, which peaked at number seven on the UK Singles Chart in June 1992. This success was followed by &quot;I Found Heaven&quot;, then by the first Barlow ballad &quot;A Million Love Songs&quot;, which also reached number seven in October. Their cover of the Barry Manilow hit &quot;Could It Be Magic&quot; gave them their first big success, peaking at number three in the UK in the first chart of 1993. Their first album, &quot;Take That &amp; Party&quot;, was released in 1992, and included all the hit singles to date.

===1993–1995: &quot;Everything Changes&quot;, &quot;Nobody Else&quot; and superstardom===
1993 saw the release of &quot;Everything Changes&quot;, based on Barlow&#x27;s original material. It peaked at number one in the UK and spawned six singles, with four being consecutive UK number one singles—their first number one &quot;Pray&quot;, &quot;Relight My Fire&quot;, &quot;Babe&quot; and the title track &quot;Everything Changes&quot;. The lead single &quot;Why Can&#x27;t I Wake Up with You&quot; had narrowly missed the top spot in the UK peaking at number two and the sixth and final single &quot;Love Ain&#x27;t Here Anymore&quot; taken from the album reached number three on the UK charts. &quot;Everything Changes&quot; saw the band gain international success with the album being nominated for the 1994 Mercury Prize, but it failed to crack the U.S. market, where a U.S.-exclusive remix of &quot;Love Ain&#x27;t Here Anymore&quot; gained little success.

By 1994, Take That had become radio and television stars across Europe and Asia, but it was not until 1995 that they did their first World Tour. It was during the years 1993–95 that the band fronted scores of magazine covers ranging from &quot;Smash Hits&quot; to &quot;GQ&quot;, becoming mass merchandised on all sorts of paraphernalia ranging from picture books, to posters, stickers, their own dolls, jewellery, caps, T-shirts, toothbrushes and even had their own annuals released. The band had also developed a large female teenage fanbase at the time. During this time, they performed at numerous music awards shows and chart shows such as the Brit Awards and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, also winning the Best Live Act award in 1995 at the MTV Europe Music Awards, having been renowned for their breakdance routines, high energy and creative tour productions.

In 1995, Take That released their third studio album &quot;Nobody Else&quot;, again based on Barlow&#x27;s own material which reached number 1 in the UK and across Europe, capturing new audiences along the way, with Take That also able to make inroads in the adult audience in Britain through Barlow&#x27;s melodic, sensitive ballads. For nearly five years, Take That&#x27;s popularity was unsurpassed in Britain. The release of the first single from the album, &quot;Sure&quot;, achieved yet another number one in the UK charts. It was not until their second release from that album, however, that they would experience what would become their biggest hit single, &quot;Back for Good&quot;, which reached number one in many countries including the UK, Germany, Australia, and Norway. It was also their only hit in the USA, where it reached number seven.

The song was initially unveiled for the first time via live performance while at the 1995 BRIT Awards, and based on the reception of that performance, the record pre-sold more records than expected and forced the record label to bring the release date forward by an unprecedented six weeks. The album was also noted for its cover, which was a parody of the famed cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; cover sleeve.

===1995–1996: Break-up and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;===

Robbie Williams&#x27;s drug abuse had escalated to a near drug overdose the night before the group was scheduled to perform at the MTV Europe Music Awards in 1994.

In June 1995, Williams was photographed by the press partying with Oasis at the Glastonbury Festival. The following month, the band offered him an ultimatum; he was to adhere to the band&#x27;s responsibilities or leave before their scheduled world tour. Williams chose the latter. Williams claimed he was bored with Barlow&#x27;s leadership and jealous of Barlow. Despite the loss of Williams, Take That continued to promote &quot;Nobody Else&quot; as a four-piece, scoring a further hit single with &quot;Never Forget&quot; with Donald on lead vocals. They subsequently went to America and completed the Nobody Else Tour in October 1995. Following the tour, the band began to plan for their next album; however, when they spent Christmas together, they mutually agreed it was time to part ways.

On 13 February 1996, Take That formally announced that they were disbanding. This was followed by the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation in 1996, which contained a new recording, a cover of the Bee Gees&#x27; &quot;How Deep Is Your Love&quot;. The single went on to become what was to be the band&#x27;s final UK number one until their 2006 comeback a decade later. Take That gave what was thought to be their final performance in April 1996 in Almere-Haven. Following the band&#x27;s announcement, millions of their fans were distraught around the world and in the UK alone, teenage girls threatened suicide and were seen lining streets in tears, to the point that telephone hotlines were set up by the Samaritans charity to deal with counselling them. After the band broke up, highly respected music figures such as Elton John noted that Take That were different from other boy bands before and after them, in that they wrote their own material through Gary Barlow. Barlow is one of only two people to have won an Ivor Novello award during their time in a boy band, with Tony Mortimer whilst in East 17 being the other to have achieved this feat. Take That had also left a legacy of being immaculate performers with a very high work ethic, causing them to be voted in as the greatest boy band of all time.

===2005–2006: Reunion as a quartet and &quot;Never Forget – The Ultimate Collection&quot;===
On 14 November 2005, &quot;Never Forget – The Ultimate Collection&quot;, a new compilation of their hit singles including a new previously unreleased song, also achieved great success and peaked at number 2 on UK charts, selling over 2.4 million copies in the UK alone. The new song &quot;Today I&#x27;ve Lost You&quot; (recorded in September 2005) was originally written by Barlow as the follow-up to &quot;Back for Good&quot; but was never recorded. On 16 November 2005, the group got back together for the ITV1 documentary &quot;Take That: For the Record&quot;, in which they aired their views over their fame, success, the split and what the post-Williams line-up had done since.

On 25 November 2005, there was an official press conference by the band announcing that the post-Robbie Williams line-up was going to tour in 2006. The tour, entitled &quot;The Ultimate Tour&quot;, ran from April to June 2006. The tour featured a guest appearance by British soul singer Beverley Knight, who replaced Lulu&#x27;s vocals on the song &quot;Relight My Fire&quot;; although Lulu did appear during the stadium shows on &quot;Relight My Fire&quot; and &quot;Never Forget&quot;. The Pussycat Dolls supported the group at their Dublin concert, and the Sugababes supported the group on the final five dates of the stadium leg. In a seven-year study analysing over one billion online searches via Google conducted by AccuraCast, a leading digital search agency, their comeback was ranked at number one in the UK.

===2006–2007: &quot;Beautiful World&quot;===

On 9 May 2006, Take That returned to the recorded music scene after more than ten years of absence, signing with Polydor Records. The band&#x27;s comeback album, &quot;Beautiful World&quot;, entered the UK Albums Chart at no. 1 and, as of June 2009, had sold over 2.8 million copies in the UK. It is the 35th-best-selling album in UK music history.

On &quot;Beautiful World&quot;, all four members of the band had the opportunity to sing lead vocals and contribute in the songwriting. Unlike the band&#x27;s earlier works, where the majority of their material was written by Barlow who received sole credit, all four band members are credited as co-writers, along with John Shanks. The comeback single, &quot;Patience&quot;, was released on 20 November 2006, with a special event launching it on 5 November.
On 26 November &quot;Patience&quot; hit number 1 in the UK in its second week of chart entry, making it the group&#x27;s ninth No. 1, and staying there for 4 weeks. Take That also accompanied eventual winner Leona Lewis on a live version of &quot;A Million Love Songs&quot; during the final of &quot;The X Factor&quot; on 16 December 2006.
The week after &quot;Beautiful World&quot; was released, it was announced that Take That had become the first artists ever to top the UK official single and album charts along with the download single, download album and DVD charts in the same week, as well as topping the radio charts.

The video for the number 1 hit single &quot;Shine&quot;, the follow-up to &quot;Patience&quot;, premiered on 25 January 2007 on Channel 4, ahead of its release on 26 February 2007. The band&#x27;s success continued on 14 February 2007 when Take That performed live at the Brit Awards ceremony at Earl&#x27;s Court. Their single &quot;Patience&quot; won the Best British Single category. The third single chosen from &quot;Beautiful World&quot; was &quot;I&#x27;d Wait For Life&quot;, released on 18 June 2007 in the UK. The single reached 17 in the UK Singles Chart. This may have been due to lack of promotion, as the band decided to take a pre-tour break rather than do any promotion for the single. The single &quot;Rule the World&quot;, included on the deluxe version of &quot;Beautiful World&quot;, was recorded for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Stardust&quot; (2007). It reached number two in the UK and went on to become the group&#x27;s second-best-selling single, shifting over 1.2 million units in the UK. &quot;Beautiful World&quot; was the fourth-biggest-selling album of 2007. It was announced at the start of 2007 that Take That signed a record deal with American label Interscope, and would also release their album in Canada. Starting on 11 October 2007, Take That began their &quot;Beautiful World Tour 2007&quot; in Belfast. The tour included 49 shows throughout Europe and the UK and ended in Manchester on 23 December 2007. The band received four nominations at the 2008 BRIT Awards. Nominated for Best British Group, Best British Single (&quot;Shine&quot;), Best British Album (&quot;Beautiful World&quot;) and Best Live Act, they took home the Best Live Act and the Best British Single awards. According to a 2007 MSN UK internet poll, Take That were voted as the &quot;comeback kings&quot; of the year.

===2008–2009: &quot;The Circus&quot;===

&quot;Greatest Day&quot;, the first single from the album &quot;The Circus&quot;, made its radio premiere on 13 October 2008 and it was released on 24 November. It debuted at number 1 on the UK Singles Chart on 30 November 2008. An album launch party for &quot;The Circus&quot; was held in Paris on 2 December. On its first day of release &quot;The Circus&quot; sold 133,000 copies, and after four days on sale it sold 306,000 copies (going platinum) making &quot;The Circus&quot; the fastest-selling album of the year. The album reached number 1 on the UK Albums Chart on 7 December 2008 with total first-week sales of 432,490, the third-highest-opening sales week in UK history.

On 28 October 2008, on the Radio 1 Chris Moyles show, it was announced that Take That would be touring again in June/July 2009, covering the UK and Ireland. Tickets for the &quot;Take That Present: The Circus Live&quot; tour went on sale on 31 October. The promoters, SJM, have said that the band&#x27;s tour is &quot;the fastest-selling in UK history&quot;.

On 22 May 2008, Barlow and Donald attended the 2008 Ivor Novello Awards where Take That won the award for Most Performed Work with their single &quot;Shine&quot;. Take That won the Sony Ericsson Tour of the Year award at the Vodafone music awards on 18 September 2008. They were unable to attend as they were in LA finishing off &quot;The Circus&quot;. They did send a video-link message, which was shown at the awards. On 22 November 2008, Take That appeared on week 7 of the talent show &quot;The X Factor&quot; where the finalists performed some of their greatest hits and Owen and Barlow made a guest appearance to personally coach the contestants. The band also performed on Children in Need 2008, singing their new single, &quot;Greatest Day&quot;, before donating £250,000 to the charity from their Marks and Spencer fee. The band were also voted the Greatest Boy Band of All Time, reflecting their ongoing marketability and success in the pop arena, even after two decades.
At the 2009 Brit Awards they were nominated for Best British Group and they performed &quot;Greatest Day&quot; at the ceremony. &quot;Up All Night&quot;, the second single from &quot;The Circus&quot;, was released on 2 March 2009, and peaked at number 14 on the UK Singles Chart, despite heavy airplay. In Germany and Australia, The Garden was released as the second single instead. On 7 May 2009, Take That&#x27;s official website confirmed that the third single from &quot;The Circus&quot; would be &quot;Said It All&quot; which was released on 15 June 2009, peaking at number 9 on the UK Singles chart. The video premiered on GMTV on 8 May 2009. It features all four band members dressed up as vintage circus clowns, which tied in with their forthcoming &quot;Take That Present: The Circus Live&quot; tour. Take That started their &quot;Circus Live&quot; tour at the Stadium of Light on 5 June 2009 in Sunderland and ended at the Wembley Stadium in London on 5 July 2009, which over 80,000 people attended. This tour quickly became the fastest-selling of all time, breaking all records by selling all of their 650,000 tickets in less than four-and-a-half hours.

In November 2009 Take That released the official DVD of their &quot;Circus&quot; tour, which became the fastest-selling music DVD of all time in the UK on its first day of release and stayed in the top 10 of the videos chart for over a year. This overtook the previous record sales holder, which was Take That&#x27;s &quot;Beautiful World Live&quot; tour and stayed at the number 1 spot for 8 weeks. The following week Take That released their first live album, &quot;The Greatest Day – Take That Present: The Circus Live&quot;, which sold 98,000 copies on its first day of release and was certified Platinum in July 2013. &quot;Hold Up a Light&quot; was released as the fifth and final single from &quot;The Circus&quot; to radio stations and as a digital download to promote the release of the live album. The live album also featured a stripped-down session recorded live at the famous Abbey Road Studios in London. It featured the members singing the setlist from the preceding tour, albeit in a studio setting.

===2010–2011: Williams&#x27; return and &quot;Progress&quot;===

On 7 June 2010, the news broke of a single called &quot;Shame&quot;, which had been written by Barlow and Williams and would feature the vocals of both artists. This was the first time the pair had worked together since 1995 and would appear on the second greatest hits collection of Williams. &quot;Heart and I&quot;, another track from the same album, was also co-written by Williams and Barlow. The single &quot;Shame&quot; peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart while also achieving success throughout Europe, charting in over 19 countries.

After working with the band on new material in Los Angeles, on 15 July 2010 Robbie Williams announced he was returning to Take That. After months of working together, assembling new songs for a new album and even debating a band-name change to &quot;The English&quot;, a joint statement between Williams and the group read, &quot;The rumours are true ... Take That: the original lineup, have written and recorded a new album for release later this year.&quot; The statement went on to say, &quot;Following months of speculation Gary Barlow, Howard Donald, Jason Orange, Mark Owen, and Robbie Williams confirmed they have been recording a new studio album as a five-piece, which they will release in November.&quot; The lead single from Take That&#x27;s album &quot;Progress&quot; was announced as &quot;The Flood&quot; and was released 7 November as a digital download, and on 8 November as a physical copy, with the album released a week later on 15 November. The single peaked at number 2 in the UK Singles Charts and to date has sold over 500,000 copies in the UK alone. The single also achieved success across Europe, charting inside the top 10 in ten countries while also charting in another nine countries whilst also being nominated for an Ivor Novello Award for best work.

On 26 October the band announced that they would be embarking on a huge UK stadium tour entitled Progress Live, starting in Sunderland on 27 May, and finishing with a record-breaking eight nights at London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium in July 2011. It was also announced that Williams would perform hit singles from his solo career during the tour. The band then played at some of the biggest venues across Europe for the second leg of the tour. The phenomenal demand for tickets across the country led to the web sites of all the major UK ticket suppliers either crashing or considerably slowing for hours on end. The demand and sheer volume of fans also created problems for the UK telephone network. Take That&#x27;s Progress Live also broke all records for ticket sales selling over 1.1 million tickets in one day, smashing the previous box-office record set by Take That&#x27;s Circus tour in 2008.

On the first day of release &quot;Progress&quot; became the fastest-selling album of the century, with 235,000 copies sold in just one day. The album reached number 1 in the UK, selling around 520,000 copies in its first week, becoming the second-fastest-selling album in history. After the release of &quot;Progress&quot; it was announced that Take That have become Amazon UK&#x27;s top-selling music artist of all time.

The album retained the number one spot for six consecutive weeks in the UK since its release, selling 2.4 million copies in the UK alone and becoming the best-selling album of 2010.
&quot;Progress&quot; also achieved success across Europe where it debuted at number one in Ireland, Greece, Germany and Denmark. and the European Top 100 Albums chart. It also debuted inside the top 10 of the charts in Austria, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland.

&quot;Kidz&quot; was announced as the second single from &quot;Progress&quot;, it was released 21 February 2011 and charted well across Europe. The band performed the song live at the 2011 Brit Awards hosted at The O2 Arena, where they won a Brit for Best British Group and were nominated for Best British Album. Their performance of &quot;Kidz&quot;, praised by critics, involved a highly choreographed routine featuring dancers dressed in police-styled riot gear bearing the Take That symbol on the uniform and shields. On 19 May 2011, Take That announced a new EP entitled &quot;Progressed&quot;, which contained eight tracks written by the band since they had reunited as a five-piece. It was packaged alongside the album &quot;Progress&quot; and returned the band to number 1 in the UK Album Chart the week after it was released on 13 June 2011.

Take That announced that the Progress Live tour would be released worldwide as their second live album to date and would also be released on home media formats across the UK and Europe on 21 November 2011. The DVD debuted at number 1 on the UK Music Video top 40 in its first week on release and sold over 200,000 copies in two weeks of release in the UK alone. Take That&#x27;s efforts were recognised further when they were awarded Virgin Media&#x27;s Best Live Act of 2012.
On 4 October, it was reported that Take That were to take a break after the completion of the &quot;Progress&quot; tour, with Barlow continuing his role as a judge on &quot;The X Factor&quot; and Williams recording new solo material. Take That were presented with an Ivor Novello Award for their Outstanding Contribution to British Music in May 2012.

In August 2012, Take That performed at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics, despite Barlow announcing that his daughter had been stillborn the previous week. The performance earned him praise for appearing live so soon after the tragedy. Williams was due to perform with the band but dropped out due to his wife giving birth at around the same time and thus the group performed as a four-piece. In November 2012, Take That reunited as a five-piece for the last time to perform &quot;Never Forget&quot; at the Music Industry Trust Awards. In 2013, Donald became a judge on the German version of the television dancing show &quot;Got to Dance&quot;.

===2014–2015: Line-up change and &quot;III&quot;===

In May 2013, Owen announced that Take That was to begin recording their seventh studio album in 2014, and on 14 January 2014, Donald and Barlow both tweeted that Take That had entered the studio to begin recording the album, although it was not initially clear if Williams was present at these recording sessions. On 28 April 2014, Williams announced on Twitter he was to become a father for a second time, and consequently suggested he would be unable to join Take That on their album and tour. Although welcome to return to the band at any time, Williams chose not to return for group&#x27;s seventh and eighth studio albums and their accompanying tours, focusing instead on his solo commitments. He continued to write music with his colleagues and has performed with the group on several occasions since 2011&#x27;s Progress tour and plans on returning at some point in the future.

On 24 September 2014, it was announced that Jason Orange had left the band. He said: &#x27;At a band meeting last week I confirmed to Mark, Gary and Howard that I do not wish to commit to recording and promoting a new album. &#x27;At the end of The Progress Tour I began to question whether it might be the right time for me to not continue on with Take That,&#x27; he continued. &#x27;There have been no fallings out, only a decision on my part that I no longer wish to do this,&#x27; he added. Barlow, Donald, and Owen issued a joint statement about Orange&#x27;s decision which said: &quot;This is a sad day for us. Jason leaving is a huge loss both professionally and even more so personally ... Jason&#x27;s energy and belief in what this band could achieve has made it what it is today, and we&#x27;ll forever be grateful for his enthusiasm, dedication and inspiration over the years.&quot; A day after the announcement, Robbie Williams took to Twitter to show support of Orange&#x27;s decision. &quot;Mr Orange. Until we ride again. Much love, Bro.&quot;, Williams tweeted.

On 10 October 2014, Take That unveiled their first song as a three-piece and lead single from their upcoming album. Titled &quot;These Days&quot;, it was released on 23 November 2014 and went to No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart, knocking Band Aid 30 off the top spot and becoming their 12th number one single. The album itself, called &quot;III&quot;, was released on 28 November 2014 and became the band&#x27;s seventh No. 1 album. It was then followed by a sell-out arena tour entitled Take That Live. On 14 October 2015, the band announced their new single &quot;Hey Boy&quot;, released on 16 October, which is the first single from the 2015 re-release of &quot;III&quot;. The 2015 edition of the album was released on 20 November.

In December 2015, British media buzzed about the group embarking on a stint in Las Vegas, starting 2017. Reports indicated the group impressed U.S. promoters and would headline their own residency show. Many venues circulated, including The AXIS at the Planet Hollywood Resort &amp; Casino, The Foundry at SLS Las Vegas and the Linq Theater at The LINQ Hotel &amp; Casino. Local newspaper, the &quot;Las Vegas Sun&quot; writes that everything is still unconfirmed, despite Barlow confirming the rumour on Twitter.

===2016–2017: &quot;Wonderland&quot;===
On 2 February 2016, in an interview with &quot;The Sun&quot;, Barlow revealed that Take That would release their eighth studio album later in the year. On 4 May 2016, English drum and bass duo Sigma announced their newest single would feature Take That. &quot;Cry&quot; received its first radio play on 20 May 2016 and was released on that date. On 21 October 2016, the band posted a teaser on their social media pages and website depicting the logo of the band flickering with the hashtag &quot;#WONDERLAND&quot;. The following day, it was announced that their new album, titled &quot;Wonderland&quot;, was scheduled to be released on 24 March 2017. It was then followed by a UK and Ireland arena tour entitled Wonderland Live, that commenced on 5 May 2017 at the Genting Arena in Birmingham. On 17 February 2017, the lead single of &quot;Wonderland&quot; was released. Titled &quot;Giants&quot;, it debuted at 13 in the UK charts, which became the band&#x27;s 24th UK top 20 single.

On 8 April 2017, ITV aired a specially commissioned hour-length television special titled &quot;An Evening with Take That&quot;, where the band performed some songs from the album, along with some old classics including &quot;Never Forget&quot;, &quot;Back for Good&quot; and &quot;Rule the World&quot;. The band also took part in a Q&amp;A session with the audience members. On 27 April, it was announced on Twitter that &quot;New Day&quot; would be released as the next single from the album &quot;Wonderland&quot;. The band were seen recording the music video in a field in Luton the days leading up the opening night of the Wonderland Live tour. Due to the Manchester Arena bombing just days before they were due to perform at the venue, their Manchester and Liverpool dates were rescheduled or relocated. The band returned a month later to perform at the One Love Manchester benefit concert.

On 16 September 2017, Barlow, Owen and Donald were set to perform a special one-off show in Jersey after a fan bid more than £1.2 million to win a performance from the band. This then turned in to a ticketed charity event where the money from tickets sold would go towards benefiting Children in Need. The auction was held on BBC Radio 2. On 11 November 2017, Take That began their foreign tour in Perth, Australia, the first time they have performed in the country in over twenty years. They also played in New Zealand, United Arab Emirates and Israel for the first time. Unlike the other tours, a DVD for Wonderland Live was not released. Instead, it was broadcast on Sky 1 on 23 December and in cinemas.

===2018–2020: 30th Anniversary and &quot;Odyssey&quot;===
On 16 July 2018, while performing at first ever Hits Radio Live at the Manchester Arena, Barlow, Donald and Owen confirmed that they would be touring in 2019. The tour was a Greatest Hits tour and celebrated the 30th anniversary of the band. There was also a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, &quot;Odyssey&quot;, which was released on 23 November 2018. The Greatest Hits album features existing songs from their back catalogue that have been re-imagined and three brand-new songs. It also includes collaborations with Boyz II Men, Lulu, Sigma and Barry Gibb. &quot;Odyssey&quot; reached number one in the UK album chart and was certified as a platinum selling record. The following year, Odyssey Live, the recording of their tour, reached number 5, becoming the band&#x27;s 13th top 5 album, with the DVD becoming the biggest live music sale of 2019.

In May 2020, Barlow, Donald, and Owen reunited with Williams for a virtual performance from their respective homes, hosted by price comparison website comparethemarket.com, to raise money for the music charity Nordoff Robbins and Crew Nation.

===2022–present: &quot;This Life&quot;===

In June 2022, Barlow confirmed that the band had begun working on their ninth studio album due for a late 2023 release. The album was also confirmed by Owen earlier in May. In October 2022, it was announced that Take That would perform at BST Hyde Park on 1 July 2023, supported by The Script and the Sugababes.

On 5 May 2023, the band released a rework of Greatest Day which featured Calum Scott and German artist Robin Schulz.

On 15 June 2023, the band performed in Leicester Square for the premiere of the Take That movie musical &quot;Greatest Days&quot; which was released in cinemas the following day. The film was later released on home streaming service Amazon Prime Video.

On 20 September 2023, the band announced that their new single &quot;Windows&quot; would be released on 22 September. That evening, the band teased upcoming live shows with their logo projected on arenas and stadiums around the UK &amp; Ireland, including London&#x27;s O2 Arena, Bristol Ashton Gate Stadium and Manchester&#x27;s new arena Co-Op Live. On the release day of &quot;Windows&quot;, it was announced that their ninth album, titled &quot;This Life&quot;, would be released on 24 November 2023. This Life on Tour was also announced, starting on 13 April 2024 at Sheffield Utilita Arena. To celebrate the launch on the new album, a 6 episode podcast featuring the band was announced with a new episode each week counting down the release of the album. On 17 October, the band released the second single &quot;Brand New Sun&quot;. On 3 November, the band released the third single &quot;This Life&quot;.

The event ran from 17 to 20 October 2024 and featured the band performing the album &quot;Everything Changes&quot; live in its entirety for the first time since its release in 1993, and their greatest hits. The event also featured nightclub events, pool parties, and special guests including the Sugababes, Sam Ryder, Ella Henderson, Daniel Bedingfield, Heather Small, Gok Wan and a DJ set from band member Howard Donald.

On 20 August 2024, production company Fulwell 73 and Netflix announced a behind the scenes documentary following the band&#x27;s journey featuring unseen archive and new interviews. The series is due to be released in 2025.

In February 2025, the band performed their rework of &quot;Greatest Day&quot; at the 78th British Academy Film Awards which featured in the nominated film Anora. The band also performed at the O2 Arena to celebrate 75 years of Formula One.

==In other media and charity==
In April 2006, EMI licensed the band&#x27;s songs to be used in the musical &quot;Never Forget&quot;, a musical based on songs of the band from the 1990s. Take That posted and then later removed a statement on their website distancing themselves from it.

Take That wrote and recorded the theme song &quot;Rule the World&quot; for the film &quot;Stardust&quot;, directed by Matthew Vaughn, which was released in cinemas across the globe in October 2007. In 2007, their song &quot;Back for Good&quot; was used as part of the soundtrack for popular Korean drama &quot;Coffee Prince&quot;.

Take That presented their own TV show &quot;Take That Come to Town&quot;, a variety show in which they performed some of their biggest hits. The show also featured comedy sketches with one of Peter Kay&#x27;s alter egos Geraldine McQueen. It aired on 7 December 2008 on ITV1. Sony launched their first Take That video game, &quot;SingStar Take That&quot; in 2009 for the PlayStation 3.
In November 2010, ITV aired &quot;Take That: Look Back, Don&#x27;t Stare&quot;, a black-and-white documentary which focused on the band working together for the first time in 15 years. Through a series of interviews, the band look back at their achievements while also looking forward to what the future holds for them. On 18 November 2010, Williams and Barlow appeared together live on television for the first time on the &quot;Popstars&quot; program in Germany singing their hit &quot;Shame&quot;.

In 2011, Take That&#x27;s song &quot;Love Love&quot; was used in the credits of the 2011 film &quot;X-Men: First Class&quot; and later, &quot;When We Were Young&quot; was chosen as the main theme for &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; movie. In 2015, the song &quot;Get Ready for It&quot; from their album &quot;III&quot;, was chosen as the theme song for the film &quot;&quot;.

In 2014, the band designed a Paddington Bear statue, which was exhibited outside the O2 Arena in London (one of 50 placed around the city). The statues were auctioned to raise funds for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC).

In 2017, Take That launched &quot;The Band&quot;, a musical written by Tim Firth featuring the five winners of &quot;Let It Shine&quot; and some of Take That&#x27;s biggest hits. Take That, including Robbie Williams, were billed as executive producers.

The group&#x27;s music is regularly featured in the Channel 4 show &quot;Derry Girls&quot;, notably in the third episode of the second series, when the lead characters sneak off to attend the 1993 Take That concert in Belfast; the episode features the music video for &quot;Pray&quot; and ends on footage of the band performing &quot;Everything Changes&quot;.

==Artistry==
Early in their career, Take That were known for party anthems such as &quot;Do What U Like&quot; and more mature ballads such as &quot;A Million Love Songs&quot; and &quot;Back for Good&quot;. Since reuniting in 2006, they have become more experimental: their post-2006 albums &quot;Beautiful World&quot; and &quot;The Circus&quot; have featured &quot;stadium-filling pop-rock&quot; while &quot;Progress&quot; largely leaned towards electropop. Having been dubbed the &quot;comeback kings&quot; by the media for their highly successful reunion, the group has won widespread praise for their seamless transformation from teen idols to &quot;man band&quot; without overly relying on nostalgia, instead showcasing a more mature image and sound and reinventing themselves while maintaining their artistic integrity. Jude Rogers of &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented on Take That&#x27;s post-reunion success, in light of a string of reunions by the group&#x27;s disbanded counterparts from the 1990s: &quot;Only Take That are penetrating pop&#x27;s wider consciousness by becoming a man-band rather than a boy-band, singing mature, proper pop songs that cross the generations.&quot;

Take That have garnered critical acclaim and popularity as consummate live performers and for their musical output. Their domestic concert tours have been described as &quot;some of the most flamboyant, imaginative and extravagant pop tours around&quot;. Aside from covers, all of their material is composed by the members themselves; Barlow was initially the principal songwriter who received sole credit but the other members have since taken a more active role in the composition and production process, including playing instruments for the backing track.

<doc id="371380" wikidata="Q313169" url="?curid=371380" title="Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany">
<text>Leopold II (3 October 1797 – 29 January 1870) was Grand Duke of Tuscany from 1824 to 1859. He married twice; first to Maria Anna of Saxony, and after her death in 1832, to Maria Antonia of the Two-Sicilies. By the latter, he begat his eventual successor, Ferdinand. Leopold was recognised contemporarily as a liberal monarch, authorising the Tuscan Constitution of 1848, and allowing a degree of press freedom.

The Grand Duke was deposed briefly by a provisional government in 1849, only to be restored the same year with the assistance of Austrian troops, who occupied the state until 1855. Leopold attempted a policy of neutrality with regard to the Second Italian War of Independence but was expelled by a bloodless coup on 27 April 1859, just before the beginning of the war. The Grand Ducal family left for Bologna, papal territory since the Congress of Vienna. Tuscany was occupied by soldiers of Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia for the duration of the conflict. The Armistice of Villafranca, agreed to between Napoleon III of France and Franz Joseph I of Austria on 11 July, provided for the return of the Lorraines to Florence, but Leopold himself was considered too unpopular to be accepted, and on 21 July 1859, he abdicated the throne in favour of his son, Ferdinand. Ferdinand was not, however, any more acceptable to the revolutionaries in control of Florence, and his accession was not proclaimed. Instead, the provisional government proclaimed the deposition of the House of Habsburg (16 August).

==Biography==

=== Early life and Reign ===
Born in Florence, Leopold II was the son of Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany and Princess Luisa Maria Amelia Teresa of the Two Sicilies, who were double first cousins. His maternal grandparents were Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Maria Carolina of Austria. He accompanied his father while fleeing to Germany when Tuscany was occupied by the French. He and his family returned to Florence after Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in 1814.

He succeeded his father on 18 June 1824. During the first twenty years of his reign he devoted himself to the internal development of the state. His was the mildest and least reactionary of all the Italian despotisms of the day, and although always subject to Austrian influence he refused to adopt the Austrian methods of government, allowed a fair measure of liberty to the press, and permitted many political exiles from other states to dwell in Tuscany undisturbed.

But when during the early 1840s unrest spread throughout Italy, even in Tuscany demands for a constitution and other political reforms were advanced; in 1845 and 1846, riots occurred in various parts of the country, and Leopold granted a number of administrative reforms. But Austrian influence prevented him from doing more, even had he wished to do so. The election of Pope Pius IX gave fresh encouragement to Liberalism, and on 4 September 1847 Leopold instituted the National Guard – a preparation for a constitution; soon afterward the marchese Cosimo Ridolfi (1794–1865) was appointed prime minister. The granting of the Neapolitan and Piedmontese constitutions was followed (17 February 1848) by that of Tuscany, composed by Gino Capponi.

==== Italian Wars of Independence ====
The uprisings in Milan and in Vienna aroused patriotic enthusiasm in Tuscany, where war against Austria was demanded; Leopold, yielding to popular pressure, sent a force of regulars and volunteers to co-operate with Piedmont in the Lombard campaign. His speech on their departure was uncompromisingly Italian and Liberal. &quot;Soldiers,&quot; he said, &quot;the holy cause of Italian freedom is being decided to-day on the fields of Lombardy. Already the citizens of Milan have purchased their liberty with their blood and with a heroism of which history offers few examples... Honour to the arms of Italy! Long live Italian independence!&quot; The Tuscan contingent fought bravely, though unsuccessfully, at Curtatone and Montanara.

On 26 June, the first Tuscan parliament assembled but the disturbances consequent on the failure of the campaign in Lombardy resulted in the resignation of the Ridolfi ministry, which was succeeded by that of Gino Capponi. The riots continued, especially at Livorno, which was prey to actual civil war, and the democratic party of which Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi and Giuseppe Montanelli were organizers became every day more influential. Capponi resigned, and Leopold agreed reluctantly to a Montanelli-Guerrazzi ministry, which in its turn had to fight against the extreme republican party.

New elections in the autumn of 1848 returned a constitutional majority, but it ended by voting in favour of a constituent assembly. There was talk of instituting a central Italian kingdom with Leopold as king, to form part of a larger Italian federation, but in the meanwhile the grand-duke, alarmed at the revolutionary and republican agitations in Tuscany and encouraged by the success of the Austrian troops, was, according to Montanelli, negotiating with Field Marshal Radetzky and with Pius IX, who had now abandoned his liberal tendencies, and fled to Gaeta. Leopold had left Florence for Siena, and eventually for Porto Santo Stefano, leaving a letter to Guerrazzi in which, on account of a protest from the pope, he declared that he could not agree to the proposed constituent assembly. The utmost confusion prevailed in Florence and other parts of Tuscany.

On 18 February 1849 a republic was proclaimed and on that same day Leopold sailed for Gaeta. A third parliament was elected and Guerrazzi appointed dictator. But there was great discontent, and the defeat of Charles Albert at Novara caused consternation among the Liberals. The majority, while fearing an Austrian invasion, desired the return of the grand duke who had never been unpopular, and in April 1849 the municipal council usurped the powers of the assembly and invited him to return, &quot;to save us by means of the restoration of the constitutional monarchy surrounded by popular institutions, from the shame and ruin of a foreign invasion.&quot; Leopold accepted, although he said nothing about the foreign invasion, and on 1 May sent Count Luigi Serristori to Tuscany with full powers.
=== Abdication and Later life ===
But at the same time the Austrians occupied Lucca and Livorno, and although Leopold simulated surprise at their action it has since been proved, as the Austrian general d&#x27;Aspre declared at the time, that Austrian intervention was due to the request of the grand duke. On 24 May the latter appointed G Baldasseroni prime minister, on the 25th the Austrians entered Florence and on 28 July Leopold himself returned. In April 1850 he concluded a treaty with Austria suspending the continuation for an indefinite period of the Austrian occupation with 10,000 men; in September he dismissed parliament, and the next year established a concordat with the Church of a very clerical character. He feebly asked Austria if he might maintain the constitution, and the Austrian premier, Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg, advised him to consult the pope, the king of Naples and the dukes of Parma and Modena.

On their advice he formally revoked the constitution (1852). Political trials were held, Guerrazzi and many others being condemned to long terms of imprisonment, and although in 1855 the Austrian troops left Tuscany, Leopold&#x27;s popularity was gone. Some of the Liberals, however, still believed in the possibility of a constitutional grand duke who could be induced for a second time to join Piedmont in a war against Austria, whereas the popular party headed by Ferdinando Bartolommei and Giuseppe Dolfi realised that only by the expulsion of Leopold could the national aspirations be realised. When in 1859 France and Piedmont made war on Austria, Leopold&#x27;s government failed to prevent numbers of young Tuscan volunteers from joining the Franco-Piedmontese forces. Finally an agreement was arrived at between the aristocratic constitutionalists and the popular party, as a result of which the grand-duke&#x27;s participation in the war was formally demanded.

Leopold at first gave way, and entrusted Don Neri Corsini with the formation of a ministry. The popular demands presented by Corsini were for the abdication of Leopold in favour of his son, an alliance with Piedmont and the reorganisation of Tuscany in accordance with the eventual and definite reorganisation of Italy. Leopold hesitated and finally rejected the proposals as derogatory to his dignity. On 27 April there was great excitement in Florence, Italian colours appeared everywhere, but order was maintained, and the grand duke and his family departed for Bologna undisturbed. Thus the revolution was accomplished without blood being shed, and after a period of provisional government Tuscany was incorporated in the Kingdom of Italy. On 21 July Leopold abdicated in favour of his son Ferdinand IV of Tuscany, who never reigned, but issued a protest from Dresden (26 March 1860).

Since his abdication, he then lived in exile in Austria for many years and was elected mayor of Schlackenwerth (Ostrov). He died in Rome in 29 January 1870, having stayed there since 1869. This was only a few months before Italy could capture the city.

==Evaluation==

Leopold of Tuscany was a well-meaning, not unkindly man, and fonder of his subjects than were the other Italian despots, but he was weak, and too closely bound by family ties and Habsburg traditions ever to become a real Liberal. Had he not joined the conclave of autocrats at Gaeta, and, above all, had he not summoned Austrian assistance while denying that he had done so, in 1849, he might yet have preserved his throne, and even changed the course of Italian history. At the same time his rule, if not harsh, was demoralising.

Along with his wife he was the founding patron of the Istituto Statale della Ss. Annunziata, the first female boarding school in Florence, that would educate aristocratic and noble young ladies. Leopold ordered the construction of La Botte, a water tunnel under the Arno river, which allowed for the final drainage of the Lago di Bientina, which had previously been the largest lake in Tuscany. Completed in 1859, La Botte remains an integral part of the Tuscan water management system.

==Marriages and children==
In Dresden on 28 October 1817, and by proxy in Florence on 16 November 1817, Leopold married Princess Maria Anna of Saxony. She was a daughter of Maximilian, Prince of Saxony and Caroline of Bourbon-Parma. Her maternal grandparents were Ferdinand, Duke of Parma and Archduchess Maria Amalia of Austria. Leopold and his wife were second cousins as they were both great-grandchildren of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria. They had three children:

*Archduchess Carolina Auguste Elisabeth Vincentia Johanna Josepha (Florence, 19 November 1822 – Florence, 5 October 1841)

*Archduchess Maria Maximiliana Thekla Johanna Josepha (Florence, 9 January 1827 – Florence, 18 May 1834)

Maria Anna died in Pisa on 24 April 1832. On 7 June 1833, in Naples, Leopold married secondly Maria Antonietta of the Two Sicilies. His new wife was the second daughter of Francis I of the Two Sicilies and Maria Isabella of Spain. Marie Antoinette was his first cousin. They had ten children:

*Archduchess Maria Isabella Annunziata Giovanna Giuseppa Umilta Appolonia Philomena Virginia Gabriela (21 May 1834 – 14 July 1901); married her maternal uncle Prince Francis, Count of Trapani, youngest son of Francis I of the Two Sicilies and Maria Isabella of Spain.

Her husband was a grandson of Karl, last sovereign Prince of Isenburg. They are the ancestors of Sophie, Princess of Prussia, wife of Georg Friedrich, Prince of Prussia, the head of the House of Hohenzollern.
*Archduke Ludwig Salvator Maria Joseph Johann Baptist Dominicus Rainerius Ferdinand Carl Zenobius Antonin (4 August 1847 – 12 October 1915)

<text>Caribbean English (CE, CarE) is a set of dialects of the English language which are spoken in the Caribbean and most countries on the Caribbean coasts of Central America and South America. Caribbean English is influenced by, but is distinct to the English-based creole languages spoken in the region. Though dialects of Caribbean English vary structurally and phonetically across the region, all are primarily derived from British English and West African languages. In some countries with a plurality Indian population, such as Trinidad and Tobago and Guyana, Caribbean English has further been influenced by Hindustani and other South Asian languages.

== Overview ==

* The daily-used English in the Caribbean has a different set of pronouns, typically &quot;me, meh&quot; or &quot;mi&quot;, &quot;you, yuh, he, she, it, we, wi&quot; or &quot;alawe, wunna&quot; or &quot;unu&quot;, and &quot;dem&quot; or &quot;day&quot;. Central Americans use &quot;I, mi, my, he, she, ih, it, we, wi&quot; or &quot;alawe&quot;, &quot;allayu&quot; or &quot;unu&quot;, and &quot;dem, den, deh&quot;.
* Consonant changes like &quot;h&quot;-dropping or &quot;th&quot;-stopping are common. 
* Some might be &quot;sing-songish&quot; in Trinidad and the Bahamas.
* Rhotic: Bajan (Barbadian), Guyanese
* Influenced by Irish English: Jamaican, Bajan
* Influenced by any of the above, as well as Spanish and indigenous languages: Central American English dialects like the Belizean Creole (Kriol), or the Mískito Coastal Creole and Rama Cay Creole spoken in Nicaragua

However, the English that is used in the media, education, and business and in formal or semi-formal discourse approaches the internationally understood variety of Standard English (British English in all former and present British territories and American English in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands) but with an Afro-Caribbean cadence (Spanish cadence in Puerto Rico and the Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina).

== Dialects ==

The first-order dialects deemed constituent of Caribbean English vary within scholarly literature. For instance, the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; includes only &#x27;the forms of English as spoken in Jamaica, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, Guyana, Belize, the Bahamas and Barbados, as well as in some of the smaller Eastern Caribbean nations&#x27; in deriving its phonetic transcriptions. The &quot;Dictionary of Caribbean English Usage&quot; further includes the dialects of Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, the Virgin Islands, the Netherlands Antilles, Suriname, and the Turks and Caicos.

Caribbean English-based creole languages are commonly (in popular literature) or sometimes (in scholarly literature) considered dialects of Caribbean English.

== History ==
The development of Caribbean English is dated to the West Indian exploits of Elizabethan sea dogs, which are credited with introducing to England names for new-found flora and fauna via, for instance, Hakluyt&#x27;s &quot;Principall Navigations&quot; of 1589 and Raleigh&#x27;s &quot;Discoverie of the Empyre of Guiana&quot; of 1596. As English settlements followed shortly thereafter, Caribbean English has been deemed &#x27;the oldest exportation of that language from its British homeland.&#x27; 

Two sorts of anglophone immigrants to the seventeenth-century West Indies have been described in literature – the first, consisting of indentured servants and settlers mainly from southwestern England, predominantly speaking non-standard vernaculars of English; the second, consisting of colonial administrators, missionaries, and educators, predominantly speaking more standard forms of the language. The former, along with African slaves, are credited with the development and spread of [non-standard-] English-derived creole languages, while the latter are noted as frequent sources of derision of such speech.

== Features ==

Caribbean English accents and pronunciation are variable within and across sub-dialects. For instance, Barbadian English is fully rhotic, while Jamaican English is not. Further, within Jamaican English, &quot;h&quot;-dropping is common in some social classes, but uncommon in others. Additionally, in territories with English-derived creole languages, the phonetic distinction between English and creole is thought to be continuous rather than discrete, with the creole acrolect differing &#x27;only trivially&#x27; from English.

Nevertheless, there is thought to be &#x27;a general sense in which a &quot;West Indian accent&quot; is distinguishable as such anywhere in the world.&#x27; Likely reasons for this have been described as &#x27;the general quality of CE [Caribbean English] vowels, the sharp reduction in the number of diphthongal glides and, the most distinguishing feature of all, the phrasal intonation [and] separation of syllabic pitch and stress in CE.&#x27; Broadly, the middle-register of Caribbean English is thought to contain eight fewer phonemes than Received Pronunciation.

The lexicon of Caribbean English varies, to an extent, across and within sub-dialects. &#x27;[T]he bulk of the vocabulary,&#x27; however, has been described as &#x27;identical&#x27; across the region. Additionally, in territories with English-derived creole languages, the lexical distinction between English and creole is thought to be continuous rather than discrete, such that &#x27;structurally it is impossible to draw exact lines between them.&#x27;

== Standardisation ==
The standardisation of Caribbean English is thought to have begun upon the advent of government-funded public education in the West Indies in 1833. Notably, the earliest public teachers, credited with first developing Standard Caribbean English, had been &#x27;imported direct from Britain, or recruited from among the &quot;coloured&quot; class on the islands who had benefited from their mixed parentage by receiving the rudiments of education.&#x27; Linguistically, however, the growth of public education in said standard register resulted in &#x27;a practical bilingualism&#x27; that has been described as a typical example of diglossia. By the late twentieth century, as most territories transitioned to sovereignty and adopted English as their official language, &#x27;efforts were made to define norms for Caribbean English usage in public, formal domains, and more specifically examination settings.&#x27; These are thought to have culminated in the 1996 publication of the &quot;Dictionary of Caribbean English Usage&quot;, commonly deemed the authority on Standard Caribbean English, with the former defining the latter as &#x27;the total body of regional lexicon and usage bound to a common core of syntax and morphology shared with [non-Caribbean forms of standardised English], but aurally distinguished as a discrete type by certain phonological features.&#x27;
== Study ==
The earliest scholarly dictionary of Caribbean English is thought to have been the 1967 &quot;Dictionary of Jamaican English&quot;. During Easter of that same year, the Caribbean Association of Headmasters and Headmistresses resolved – 
Said resolution was promptly forwarded to Richard Allsopp, who by mid-1967 &#x27;already had some ten shoe-boxes each of about 1,000 6 × 4 cards and many loose unfiled cuttings, notes and other material [from Guyana, the Lesser Antilles, Belize, Jamaica, and Trinidad].&#x27; In 1971, Allsopp introduced the Caribbean Lexicography Project as &#x27;a survey of [English] usage in the intermediate and upper ranges of the West Indian speech continuum.&#x27; This set the stage for the seminal &quot;Dictionary of Caribbean English Usage,&quot; first published 1996.
== Samples ==

Standard English: &#x27;Where is that boy?&#x27; 

*Barbados: &#x27;Wherr dah boi?&#x27; (spoken very quickly, rhotic with glottal stops).
*San Andrés and Providencia: &#x27;Weh dah boi deh?&#x27; 
*Jamaica: &#x27;Weh dah bwoy deh?&#x27; (sporadic rhoticity from Irish and Scottish influence); or &#x27;Wey iz dat boi?&#x27; (non-rhotic and similar to the accents of southwestern England and Wales).
*Belize: &#x27;Weh iz dat bwoy deh?&#x27; (British and North American influence but deeper in tone).
*Trinidad: &#x27;Wey dat boy deh?&#x27; 
*Bahamas: &#x27;Wey dat boy iz?&#x27; (some would more likely say &quot;bey&quot; [beɪ] instead of &quot;boy&quot;).
*Guyana and Tobago: &#x27;Weyr iz daht boy/bai?&#x27; often in urban regions, or &#x27;Wey dat boy dey?&#x27; in rural regions (many variations depending on region or descent of speaker, and competency in standard English; sporadic rhoticity).
* Saint Vincent and the Grenadines: &#x27;Wey dah boy deh deh?&#x27; (non-rhotic).
*Belize, Bluefields, Pearl Lagoon, Corn Islands, Bay Islands Department, Limón, Bocas del Toro Province, Puerto Rico, Cayman Islands and the Virgin Islands: &#x27;Wehr iz daht booy?&#x27; (distinct, sporadic rhoticity, pronunciation becomes quite different from Creole pronunciation).
* Dominica: &#x27;Weh dat boy (be) nuh?&#x27; (spoken harshly and with a deep tone).

The written form of the English language in the former and current British-controlled Caribbean countries conforms to the spelling and the grammar styles of Britain and in Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands conforms to the spelling and the grammar styles of United States.

<text>Lindau is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in Swabia, Bavaria, Germany; its capital is the city of Lindau. It is bounded by (from the east and clockwise) the district of Oberallgäu, Austria (federal state of Vorarlberg), Lake Constance and the state of Baden-Württemberg (districts of Bodensee and Ravensburg).

==History==

The city of Lindau became a Free Imperial City in the 13th century; it was directly subordinate to the emperor. The rural areas around Lindau were the property of monasteries or tiny counties, that rose and fell in the region. When Napoleon gained influence in the area, all these entities were dissolved in the German Mediatisation and Lindau fell to Bavaria.

The district of Lindau was established in 1938. After the Second World War it became — like the Rhenish Palatinate — part of the French zone of occupation to create a land bridge between the French zones in Germany and Austria, while the rest of Bavaria was under American occupation. The district was administered jointly with Württemberg-Hohenzollern, but belonged neither to Bavaria or Württemberg and had a special territorial position. Throughout its special status, the district was administered by Bregenz native Anton Zwisler (1888-1977).

The district was represented by three delegates in the Advisory State Assembly (Beratende Landesversammlung) and later Landtag of Württemberg-Hohenzollern. On September 25, 1948, the city of Lindau was spun off from the district and became a district-free city.

Lindau earned a lot of pet names during the period, namely &quot;Second Principality of Liechtenstein&quot; (Zweites Fürstentum Liechtenstein), &quot;Paradise&quot; (Paradies), &quot;Germany&#x27;s Grease Spot&quot; (Deutschlands Fettfleck) and &quot;Monte Carlo on Lake Constance&quot; (Monte Carlo am Bodensee). The latter name came from the casino, which opened in Lindau in 1950, the others were used to refer to Lindau&#x27;s self-sufficiency, as the district was allowed to keep all taxes and custom duties for itself. Also, while in some other parts of Germany, people suffered from hunger, Lindau had a surplus of fruit, milk and meat for export and a brisk construction activity.

With the signing of the Austrian State Treaty restoring Austrian independence and the withdrawal of Allied forces, Lindau&#x27;s bridging function for France, and thus the need for special position, became obsolete, so on September 1, 1955 the district was reincorporated into Bavaria, with a negotiated transition period until March 27, 1956, when a ceremony was held at Lindau&#x27;s Old Town Hall attended by Zwisler and then-Bavarian Minister-President Wilhelm Hoegner. The city of Lindau, which had been an urban district, became a part of the rural district in 1972.

==Geography==

In the southwest the district borders Lake Constance, more precisely its eastern part known as &quot;Obersee&quot;. To the north the countryside rises to the hills of the western Allgäu mountains.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms displays:
* the blue and white checked pattern of Bavaria
* a lime tree symbolising the city of Lindau (&quot;lime tree&quot; is &quot;Linde&quot; in German)
* the arms of the counts of Montfort
* a blue wavy line symbolising Lake Constance

<doc id="371388" wikidata="Q36104" url="?curid=371388" title="Ligurian language (ancient)">
<text>The Ligurian language was an ancient tongue spoken by the Ligures, an indigenous people inhabiting regions of northwestern Italy and southeastern France during pre-Roman and Roman times. Because Ligurian is so sparsely attested, its classification and relationship to neighbouring languages has proven difficult, prompting debate among linguists for much of the 20th century.

The current scholarly consensus is that Ligurian was likely an Indo-European language or language family, possibly Celtic, or at least influenced by or related to Celtic languages. However, this hypothesis is primarily based on toponymy and onomastics, and on a few glosses given by ancient Graeco-Roman writers (since no Ligurian texts have survived), and thus remains partly speculative due to the scarcity of data. Because of that, some scholars have even cast doubt on the existence of a Ligurian language itself, since it can remain problematic to postulate that all the non-Celtic and non-Italic forms found across the regions described as &quot;Ligurian&quot; by ancient sources come from a single language instead of several ancient dialects.

Influenced by the work of Henri d&#x27;Arbois de Jubainville, some 20th-century scholars have attempted to identify Ligurian as a remnant of a Pre-Indo-European or Indo-European substratum. These theories, particularly those attempting to establish additional connections with data from other European regions, have faced increasing criticism in recent scholarship.

==Ancient sources==

=== Territory ===

Early Greek geographers, such as Hecataeus of Miletus (6th century BC) and Pseudo-Scylax (4th century BC), used the term &quot;Ligues&quot; as a broad label for the so-called barbarians of the distant West. They placed these peoples in a semi-mythical setting at the outer edges of the known world, comparable to other legendary groups like the Hyperboreans or Ethiopians, who were believed to inhabit the world&#x27;s extreme boundaries. In these sources, &quot;Ligustica,&quot; the land of the &quot;Ligues&quot;, often aligned with Massalia&#x27;s sphere of influence, stretching from Emporion in Catalonia to Antipolis (Antibes) in southeastern France. Classical Greek authors of this period do not mention any Ligures in Italy. Instead, they describe Ligurian territory as ending east around Antipolis or Monoikos (Monaco), beyond which began the domains of the Tyrrhenians (Etruscans) or Pelasgians.

Over time, as geographic knowledge improved and distinct groups like the Iberians and Gauls came into clearer focus, references to the Ligures became more concrete. Later Latin authors continued to echo elements of the older, semi-mythical tradition, yet the idea of Ligures as a general label for the distant West gradually gave way to a more localised concept, placing them in a specific region around Massalia (Marseille).

By the 3rd century BCE, Roman records (the &quot;Acta triumphalia Populi Romani&quot; of P. Lentulus Caudinus) began mentioning Ligures in Italy, north of the Magra River. This suggests that the Romans recognised a distinct people called &#x27;Ligures&#x27; in the Italian Peninsula, separate from the older Greek tradition of &#x27;Ligues&#x27; in southern Gaul. In the subsequent centuries, Roman military campaigns in the region (including one against the Ingauni in 185–180 BCE) gradually brought to light the existence of Ligures in northwestern Italy, culminating in the formal establishment of the &quot;Region IX&quot; &quot;Liguria&quot; under Augustus (27 BC – 14 AD). At that point, the Ligures occupied the westernmost part of the Italian peninsula and a portion of the nearby French coastline, extending from Album Intimilium (modern Ventimiglia) to Ameglia.

=== Ethnicity ===
Early Greek authors such as Hecataeus of Miletus and Pseudo-Scylax probably used &#x27;Ligure&#x27; a generic name for such distant and partially known tribes, or merely as a geographic reference that had no relevance to their ethnicity. To reconcile conflicting accounts, certain sources coined terms like &#x27;Celto-Ligure&#x27; to suggest an ethnic intermingling. Latin historian Livy believed that the Ligures represented an older stratum predating the Gauls in northern Italy, while Strabo and others observed that many of the peoples previously described as &#x27;Ligures&#x27; were actually Celts. In an attempt to resolve these inconsistencies, Strabo proposed that Celtic influence had effectively supplanted the original Ligures.

Writing in the early 1st century AD, Strabo noted that the Ligures living in the Alps were a people distinct from the Celts, even though they shared cultural similarities:
Regarding the tribes around Massalia, earlier writers called the Salyes &#x27;Ligure&#x27;, while Strabo used the denomination &#x27;Celto-Ligure&#x27;. According to scholars, this suggests that their culture gradually came under the influence of a Celtic-speaking elite, as evidenced by the Celtic name of their rulers and towns, and the Celtic influence on their religion. Similarly, the Segobriges were identified as Ligures by the oldest texts about the foundation of Massalia, but their ethnonym and the names of their chiefs are undoubtedly Celtic.

=== Ligurian lexicon ===
Some glosses appear in the text of ancient writers. Greek historian Herodotus, while discussing the name of the people known as the Sigynnae (Greek: &quot;Sigúnnai&quot;), a nomadic tribe from Central Europe, noted that the term &quot;sigynnae&quot; was also used by the Ligures living &quot;up beyond Marseille&quot; to refer to traders. The Ligurian name of the River Po, recorded as &quot;Bodincus&quot;, is said by Pliny to mean &quot;of unmeasured depth&quot;, which can be compared to Sanskrit &quot;budhná&quot;- (&#x27;bottom, ground, base, depth&#x27;), Latin &quot;fundus&quot; and Middle Irish &quot;bond&quot; (&#x27;sole of the shoe&#x27;). 

Many of the other proposed Ligurian glosses remain uncertain. The term &quot;lebērís&quot; (λεβηρίς), recorded by Strabo as a Massiliote word for &#x27;rabbit&#x27;, is believed to have been borrowed into Latin as &quot;lepus&quot;. Pliny the Elder mentions &quot;langa&quot; or &quot;langurus&quot; as a type of lizard inhabiting the banks of the Po River, which Johannes Hubschmid linked to the Latin &quot;longus&quot; (&#x27;long&#x27;). The term &quot;asia&quot;, meaning &#x27;rye&#x27; and recorded by Pliny, could be amended to &quot;sasia&quot; and connected to the Sanskrit &quot;sasya-&quot; (&#x27;corn, grain, fruit, crop&#x27;) and Welsh &quot;haidd&quot; (&#x27;barley&#x27;), though these connections remain unsure.

== Classification ==
Most experts on the ancient languages of the region, including Patrizia de Bernardo Stempel, Xavier Delamarre, Jürgen Untermann, Javier de Hoz, Franceso Rubat Borel, and Bernard Mees, agree that Ligurian was part of the Indo-European language family.

However, there is debate regarding the relationship with Celtic, as Ligurian exhibits both similarities and differences with neighbouring Celtic languages (i.e. Gaulish and Lepontic). De Bernardo Stempel has proposed that Ligurian might represent an archaic Celtic dialect that was influenced by a non-Celtic substratum to account for these differences, and Delamarre believes &quot;that the term &#x27;Ligurian&#x27; refers to the population involved in the first Celtic invasions into southern Europe&quot;. Conversely, Rubat Borel, de Hoz, Untermann and Mees argue that Ligurian was a separate Indo-European language or language family, either related to or influenced by Celtic.

There is also debate about the geographical range of linguistic elements that can be attributed to the Ligurian language. Javier de Hoz has proposed distinguishing between the region inhabited by the &#x27;Ligures&#x27; of the Roman &quot;regio Liguria&quot; (between Ventimiglia and Ameglia), and the area mentioned in early ancient sources as home to the &#x27;Ligues&#x27; (from the Arno River to west of the Rhône, and possibly even as far as northeastern Spain). He refers to the language of the former as &#x27;restricted Ligurian&#x27;, noting that this group had a well-defined cultural identity and likely used an Indo-European language about which little is known. In contrast, the latter region, which he described as &#x27;broad Ligurian&#x27;, was inhabited by culturally related but likely diverse peoples who may have spoken various languages.

=== Relationship with Celtic ===
Linguists Patrizia de Bernardo Stempel and Xavier Delamarre have argued that many names of tribes described by ancient scholars as &#x27;Ligurian&#x27; can be explained as Celtic. This includes the &quot;Ingauni&quot; ( *&quot;Pingāmnī&quot;), &quot;Salyes&quot; (&lt; *&quot;Sḷwes&quot;), &quot;Ligauni&quot; ( &quot;līg&quot;- or &quot;liga&quot;-), &quot;Intimilii&quot; ( &quot;uindi-&quot;), &quot;Maricii&quot; ( &quot;maro-&quot;), and &quot;Oxybii&quot; ( &quot;oxso&quot;- or &quot;uxso&quot;-), as well as the &quot;Iemerii&quot; ( &quot;iemur-&quot;), &quot;Orobii&quot; ( &quot;orbi-&quot;), &quot;Segobrigii&quot; ( &quot;sego-&quot;) and &quot;Reii&quot; ( &quot;*riio-&quot;).

According to de Bernardo Stempel, such linguistically Celtic tribal names suggest that a &#x27;Celto-Ligurian&#x27; dialect played an important role among the languages spoken in ancient Ligury. Furthermore, she notes that some lexical items appear to be common to Ligurian and Celtic, such as &quot;cotto&quot;- (&quot;Alpes Cottiae&quot;), &quot;gando&quot;- (&quot;Gandovera&quot;), &quot;ambi-&quot; (&quot;pago Ambitrebio&quot;), &quot;ebu&quot;- (&quot;Eburelia&quot;), &quot;medu&quot;- (&quot;Medutio&quot;), &quot;seg&quot;- (&quot;Segesta Tigulliorum&quot;), &quot;catu&quot;- (&quot;Catucianum&quot;), and &quot;roud&quot;- (&quot;Roudelium&quot;).

Arguing for a connection between Ligurian and Celtic languages, de Bernardo Stempel has listed the following isoglosses as common traits shared by both language groups:

* IE *&quot;bh&quot; &gt; &quot;b&quot;, as shown by &quot;Comberanea rivus&quot; and &quot;Badiennon&quot;, from the Celtic &quot;badius&quot; (&#x27;shiny ; yellow, blond&#x27;)
* loss of initial &quot;p&quot;-, as in &quot;Ingauni&quot; &lt; *&quot;ping-amn-ī&quot;
* *&quot;ḷ&quot; &gt; &quot;al&quot; before resonant, as in &quot;*Sḷwes&quot; &gt; &quot;Salues&quot;
* lenition of voiced consonants, as in &quot;Ligauni&quot; &lt; *&quot;ligamni&quot;
* unstressed *-&quot;yo&quot;- &gt; -&quot;ye&quot;-, as shown by &quot;Nitielium&quot; and &quot;Berigiema&quot;
* &quot;o&quot; &gt; &quot;u&quot; before labials, as in &quot;Leucumellus&quot; and &quot;Latumarui&quot;
* assibilation, as shown by &quot;Mezu&quot; and &quot;Meśiolano&quot;
* palatal anticipation, as in &quot;Airuno&quot;, &quot;Airasca&quot;, &quot;Airolo&quot;, and &quot;Eluveitie&quot;
* epenthesis, as shown by &quot;Berigiema&quot; and &quot;Alebinna&quot;
* suffixes *-&quot;enko&quot;- and *-&quot;asko&quot;-, as in &quot;Bodincos&quot; and &quot;Vinelasca&quot; (&lt; *&quot;wind-el-askā&quot;)

Amongst Celtic subgroups, common innovations are only shared with Lepontic, including *&quot;ks&quot; &gt; &quot;s&quot;, *&quot;nd&quot; &gt; &quot;n(n)&quot;, *&quot;st&quot; &gt; &quot;z&quot;, &quot;VCyV&quot; &gt; &quot;VyCV&quot;, the analogical acc. pl. *-&quot;aś&quot; &gt; -&quot;eś&quot; after the nom. pl. -&quot;es&quot; (consonantal stems), gen. sg. -&quot;y&quot;-&quot;os&quot; &amp; -&quot;ei&quot;-&quot;s&quot; → -&quot;ei&quot; -&quot;os&quot; (i-stems), gen. sg. *-&quot;osyo&quot;, 3rd sg. preterite in -&quot;te&quot;, patronymic -&quot;alo&quot;-, patronymic -&quot;ikno&quot;-, gamonymic -&quot;iknā&quot;, and monothematic personal names. Conversely, some innovations are shared between Ligurian and the Gaulish language of the early sources, such as gen. sg. *-&quot;ī&quot;, 3rd sg. preterite in -&quot;tu&quot;, and patronymic -&quot;ikno&quot;-.

=== Non-Celtic Indo-European forms ===
On the other hand, some Ligurian ethnonyms show a weaker or less evident connection to Celtic, such as the name &quot;Friniates&quot;, which can be hardly regarded as genuinely Celtic. Although &quot;Deciates&quot; seems to derive from the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) root *&quot;dek̑-&quot;, it does not appear to be Celtic. Consequently, Javier de Hoz suggests classifying the name as &#x27;restricted Ligurian&#x27;, given the tribe&#x27;s geographical location. The ethnic name &quot;Taurini&quot;, from the Indo-European *&quot;tauros&quot; (&#x27;bull&#x27;), does not follow the metathesized Celtic form &quot;taruos&quot;. According to Delamarre, this could be explained by the influence of Latin, or else by the preservation of an archaic form.

Similarly, the Ligurian &quot;Bodincos&quot; (&#x27;of unmeasured depth&#x27;), from PIE &quot;*bʰudʰnós&quot;, does not display the metathesis of Italo-Celtic *&quot;bʰundʰós&quot; (Latin &quot;fundus&quot;, Gaulish *&quot;bunda&quot;). The ethnonym &quot;Eguiturii&quot; (&lt; PIE *&quot;h₁éḱwos&quot; &#x27;horse&#x27;) also features an archaic preservation of labio-velar &quot;-kʷ-,&quot; in contrast to Gaulish &quot;epos&quot; (which can be compared to the Ligurian &quot;Epanterii&quot;). The similarity between the ancient names of Genoa (&quot;Genua&quot;), in the ancient Ligurian region, and Geneva (&quot;Genaua&quot;), in Celtic-speaking territory, has been highlighted by scholars, but if both toponyms could derive from the Celtic &quot;*genu&quot; (&#x27;mouth&#x27;), the PIE stem *&quot;ǵónu&quot;- (&#x27;knee&#x27;), which is commonly found in other Indo-European language groups, may also be at the origin of the names.

Francesco Rubat Borel has highlighted unusual Ligurian phonological changes not seen in Celtic languages, such as *&quot;upo&quot;- &gt; &quot;uea&quot;- and *&quot;o&quot; &gt; &quot;a&quot; in unstressed syllables, the toponymic suffix -&quot;asc&quot;-, and the retained *&quot;p&quot; in &quot;Porcobera&quot;, which would make claims of Ligurian as a Celtic language problematic. According to Bernard Mees, Ligurian appears to share some phonological features with Celtic while differing significantly in morphology, suggesting it was a separate language with certain similarities to Celtic. He writes that &quot;the Romans did not consider the Ligurians to be Celts, and although there are some evident parallels between Ligurian and Celtic names, these can all be understood as reflecting inherited Indo-European features, not distinctively Celtic traits.&quot; By analysing Ligurian personal names, Jürgen Untermann concluded that Ligurian is best considered an Indo-European language or language family separate from both Celtic and Italic.

=== Substrate theories ===
In the late 19th century, Henri d&#x27;Arbois de Jubainville proposed that the Ligures constituted an early Indo-European substratum in Western Europe, separate from both Gaulish and Italic groups. Building on classical sources, he identified a range of place names and tribal names that did not fit neatly into known Celtic or Italic patterns. His theory, which came to be termed &quot;Celto-Ligurian&quot;, influenced philological and archaeological approaches for the following decades. According to Bernard Mees, de Jubainville became &quot;the intellectual grandfather to a genealogy of prehistorical and protohistorical substratum theories&quot;.By the 1920s, scholars were using the &quot;Celto-Ligurian&quot; idea to explain problematic Indo-European toponyms and hydronyms across much of Europe. For instance, Paul Kretschmer argued that some inscriptions in Etruscan script (later identified as Lepontic Celtic) provided evidence for a Ligurian linguistic layer, but subsequent discoveries established these as clearly Celtic with only limited Etruscan influence. In the 1930s, Julius Pokorny adopted these insights for his pan-Illyrian (or &quot;Illyro-Venetic&quot;) theory, linking it to the prehistoric Urnfield culture. Consequently, many difficult place-name etymologies were attributed to a hypothetical Illyrian layer, leading to broad, stratigraphical theories that traced Indo-European linguistic influences from Gaul all the way to the Balkans.

By the late 1950s, Pokorny&#x27;s theories had lost its momentum following critical scrutiny. The underlying place-name elements championed by de Jubainville and Pokorny, however, were reworked by Hans Krahe into his &quot;Old European&quot; theory. Focusing on hydronyms, Krahe advanced a more refined approach, yet it remained conceptually indebted to de Jubainville&#x27;s earlier &quot;Celto-Ligurian&quot; framework. Though Krahe proposed a more systematic argument than the earlier &quot;Illyrian&quot; or &quot;Celto-Ligurian&quot; frameworks, his theory still faced criticism for assuming that widespread, older Indo-European features belonged to one single language rather than several archaic dialects.

Linguist James Clackson has criticized these approaches by stating that &quot;the label &#x27;Ligurian&#x27; merely serves to conceal our ignorance&quot; about the pre-Roman linguistic landscape in various regions of Europe.

<text>ISO 639-2:1998, &quot;Codes for the representation of names of languages — Part 2: Alpha-3 code&quot;, is the second part of the ISO 639 standard, which lists codes for the representation of the names of languages. The three-letter codes given for each language in this part of the standard are referred to as &quot;Alpha-3&quot; codes. There are 487 entries in the list of ISO 639-2 codes.

The US Library of Congress is the registration authority for ISO 639-2 (referred to as ISO 639-2/RA). As registration authority, the LOC receives and reviews proposed changes; they also have representation on the ISO 639-RA Joint Advisory Committee responsible for maintaining the ISO 639 code tables.

==History and relationship to other ISO 639 standards==
Work was begun on the ISO 639-2 standard in 1989, because the ISO 639-1 standard, which uses only two-letter codes for languages, is not able to accommodate a sufficient number of languages. The ISO 639-2 standard was first released in 1998.

In practice, ISO 639-2 has largely been superseded by ISO 639-3 (2007), which includes codes for all the individual languages in ISO 639-2 plus many more. It also includes the special and reserved codes, and is designed not to conflict with ISO 639-2. ISO 639-3, however, does not include any of the collective languages in ISO 639-2; most of these are included in ISO 639-5.

==B and T codes==

While most languages are given one code by the standard, twenty of the languages described have two three-letter codes, a &quot;bibliographic&quot; code (ISO 639-2/B), which is derived from the English name for the language and was a necessary legacy feature, and a &quot;terminological&quot; code (ISO 639-2/T), which is derived from the native name for the language and resembles the language&#x27;s two-letter code in ISO 639-1. There were originally 22 B codes; and are now deprecated.

In general the T codes are favored; ISO 639-3 uses ISO 639-2/T. 

==Scopes and types==
The codes in ISO 639-2 have a variety of &quot;scopes of denotation&quot;, or types of meaning and use, some of which are described in more detail below.
* Individual languages
* Macrolanguages (see ISO 639 macrolanguage)
* Collections of languages
* Dialects
* Reserved for local use
* Special situations

For a definition of macrolanguages and collective languages, see ISO 639-3/RA: Scope of denotation for language identifiers.

Individual languages are further classified as to type:
* Living languages
* Extinct languages
* Ancient languages
* Historic languages
* Constructed languages

===Collections of languages===
Some ISO 639-2 codes that are commonly used for languages do not precisely represent a particular language or some related languages (as the above macrolanguages). They are regarded as collective language codes and are excluded from ISO 639-3.

The collective language codes in ISO 639-2 are listed below. Some language groups are noted to be remainder groups, that is excluding languages with their own codes, while other are not. Remainder groups are codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, codice_4, codice_5, codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, codice_9, codice_10, codice_11, codice_12, codice_13, codice_14, codice_15, codice_16, codice_17, codice_18, codice_19, codice_20, codice_21, codice_22, codice_23, codice_24, codice_25, codice_26, codice_27, codice_28, codice_29, codice_30, codice_31, codice_32, codice_33, codice_34, codice_35 and codice_36, while inclusive groups are codice_37, codice_38, codice_39, codice_40, codice_41, codice_42, codice_43, codice_44, codice_45, codice_46, codice_47, codice_48, codice_49, codice_50, codice_51, codice_52, codice_53, codice_54, codice_55, codice_56, codice_57, codice_58, codice_59, codice_60, codice_61, codice_62, codice_63 and codice_64.

The following code is identified as a collective code in ISO 639-2 but is (at present) missing from ISO 639-5:
* Himachali

Codes registered for 639-2 that are listed as collective codes in ISO 639-5 (and collective codes by name in ISO 639-2):

===Reserved for local use===
The interval from to is &quot;reserved for local use&quot; and is not used in ISO 639-2 nor in ISO 639-3. These codes are typically used privately for languages not (yet) in either standard. Microsoft Windows uses the language code for pseudo-locales generated automatically from English strings, designed for testing software localization.

===Special situations===
There are four generic codes for special situations:
* is listed as &quot;uncoded languages&quot; (originally an abbreviation for &quot;miscellaneous&quot;)
* (for &quot;multiple languages&quot;) is applied when several languages are used and it is not practical to specify all the appropriate language codes
* (for &quot;undetermined&quot;) is used in situations in which a language or languages must be indicated but the language cannot be identified.
* is listed in the code list as &quot;no linguistic content&quot;, e.g. animal sounds (code added on 11 January 2006)
These four codes are also used in ISO 639-3.

<doc id="371406" wikidata="Q7777019" url="?curid=371406" title="Meadow">
<text>A meadow ( ) is an open habitat or field, vegetated by grasses, herbs, and other non-woody plants. Trees or shrubs may sparsely populate meadows, as long as these areas maintain an open character. Meadows can occur naturally under favourable conditions, but are often artificially created from cleared shrub or woodland for the production of hay, fodder, or livestock. Meadow habitats, as a group, are characterized as &quot;semi-natural grasslands&quot;, meaning that they are largely composed of species native to the region, with only limited human intervention. 

Meadows attract a multitude of wildlife, and support flora and fauna that could not thrive in other habitats. They are ecologically important as they provide areas for animal courtship displays, nesting, food gathering, pollinating insects, and sometimes sheltering, if the vegetation is high enough. Intensified agricultural practices (too frequent mowing, use of mineral fertilizers, manure and insecticides), may lead to declines in the abundance of organisms and species diversity. There are multiple types of meadows, including agricultural, transitional, and perpetual – each playing a unique and important part of the ecosystem.

Like other biomes, meadows will experience increased pressure (including on their biodiversity) due to climate change, especially as precipitation and weather conditions change. However, grasslands and meadows also have an important climate change mitigation potential as carbon sinks; deep-rooted grasses store a substantial amount of carbon in soil.

==Types==
===Agricultural meadows===

In agriculture, a meadow is grassland which is not regularly grazed by domestic livestock, but rather allowed to grow unchecked in order to produce hay. Their roots extend back to the Iron Age, when appropriate tools for the hay harvest emerged. The ability to produce livestock fodder on meadows had a significant advantage for livestock production, as animals could be kept in enclosures, simplifying the control over breeding. Surpluses in biomass production during the summer could be stored for the winter, preventing damages to forests and grasslands as there was no longer the need for livestock grazing during the winter.

Especially in the United Kingdom and Ireland, the term meadow is commonly used in its original sense to mean a hay meadow, signifying grassland mown annually in the summer for making hay. Agricultural meadows are typically lowland or upland fields upon which hay or pasture grasses grow from self-sown or hand-sown seed. Traditional hay meadows were once common in rural Britain, but are now in decline. Ecologist Professor John Rodwell states that over the past century, England and Wales have lost about 97% of their hay meadows. Fewer than of lowland meadows remain in the UK and most sites are relatively small and fragmented. 25% of the UK&#x27;s meadows are found in Worcestershire, with Foster&#x27;s Green Meadow managed by the Worcestershire Wildlife Trust being a major site.

A similar concept to the hay meadow is the pasture, which differs from the meadow in that it is grazed through the summer, rather than being allowed to grow out and periodically be cut for hay. A pasture can also refer to any land used for grazing, and in this wider sense the term refers not only to grass pasture but also to non-grassland habitats such as heathland, moorland and wood pasture. The term, grassland, is used to describe both hay meadows and grass pastures.

The specific agricultural practices in relation to the meadow can take on various expressions. As mentioned, this could be hay production or providing food for grazing cattle and livestock but also to give room for orchards or honey production. Meadows are embedded and dependent on a complex web of socio-cultural conditions for their maintenance. Historically, they emerged to increase agricultural efficiency when the necessary tools became available. Today, agricultural practices have shifted and meadows have largely lost their original purpose. Yet, they are appreciated today for their aesthetics and ecological functions. Consequently, the European Union&#x27;s Common Agricultural Policy subsidizes their management, mostly through grazing.

===Transitional meadows===

A transitional meadow occurs when a field, pasture, farmland, or other cleared land is no longer cut or grazed and starts to display luxuriant growth, extending to the flowering and self-seeding of its grass and wildflower species. The condition is however only temporary, because the grasses eventually become shaded out when scrub and woody plants become well-established, being the forerunners of the return to a fully wooded state. A transitional state can be artificially-maintained through a double-field system, in which cultivated soil and meadows are alternated for a period of 10 to 12 years each.

In North America prior to European colonization, Algonquians, Iroquois and other Native Americans peoples regularly cleared areas of forest to create transitional meadows where deer and game could find food and be hunted. For example, some of today&#x27;s meadows originated thousands of years ago, due to regular burnings by Native Americans.

===Perpetual meadows===
A perpetual meadow, also called a natural meadow, is one in which environmental factors, such as climatic and soil conditions, are favorable to perennial grasses and restrict the growth of woody plants indefinitely. Types of perpetual meadows may include:

* Alpine meadows occur at high elevations above the tree line and maintained by harsh climatic conditions.
* Coastal meadows maintained by salt sprays.
* Desert meadows restricted by low precipitation or lack of nutrients and humus.
* Prairies maintained by periods of severe drought or subject to wildfires.
* Wet meadows (a semi-wetland area) saturated with water throughout much of the year.

=== Urban meadow ===

Recently, urban areas have been thought of as potential biodiversity conservation sites. The shift from urban lawns, that are widely spread habitats in cities, to urban meadows is thought to promote greater refuges for plant and animal communities. Urban lawns require intensive management that puts the life there at risk of losing their habitat, especially due to the mowing frequency. Cutting that mowing frequency has demonstrated to induce a clear positive effect on the plant community&#x27;s diversity, which allows the switch from urban lawns to urban meadows.

Due to increased urbanization, the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2017 decreed that there is a need to protect all ecosystems due to climate change. The majority of the people that live in the urban regions of any country usually get their plant knowledge from visiting parks and or public green infrastructure. Local authorities have the duty of providing the green spaces for the public, but these departments are constantly suffering major budget cuts, making it more difficult for people to admire natural wildlife in the urban sectors and also impairing the local ecosystem. In line with the increasing acceptance of a &quot;messier urban aesthetic&quot;, the perennial meadows can be seen as a more realistic alternative to the classic urban lawns as they would also be more cost-efficient to maintain. Factors that managers of urban spaces list as important to regard are:

* &quot;Aesthetics and public reaction&quot;
* &quot;Locational context&quot;
* &quot;Human Resources and economic sustainability&quot;
* &quot;Local politics&quot;
* &quot;Communication&quot;
* &quot;Biodiversity and existing habitat&quot;
* &quot;Physical factors.&quot;
== Human intervention ==

Artificially or culturally conceived meadows emerge from and continually require human intervention to persist and flourish. In many places, the natural, pristine populations of free-roaming large grazers are either extinct or very limited due to human activities. This reduces or removes their natural influence on the surrounding ecology and results in meadows only being created or maintained by human intervention. Existing meadows could potentially and gradually decline, if unmaintained by agricultural practices. Humankind has influenced the ecology and the landscape for millennia in many parts of the world, so it can sometimes be difficult to discern what is natural and what is cultural. Meadows are one example. However, meadows seem to have been sustained historically by naturally occurring large grazers, which kept plant growth in checked and maintained the cleared space.

As extensive farming like grazing is diminishing in some parts of the world, the meadow is endangered as a habitat. A number of research projects attempt to restore natural meadow habitats by reintroducing natural, large grazers. These include deer, elk, goat, wild horse, etc. depending on the location. A more exotic example with a wider scope is the European Tauros Programme.

Some environmental organization recommend converting lawns to meadows by stopping or reducing mowing. They claim that meadows can better preserve biodiversity, water, reduce the use of fertilizers. For example, in 2018 environmental organizations with the support of the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs of England, concerned by the decline in the number of bees worldwide, in the first day of Bees&#x27; Needs Week 2018 (9–15 July) give some recommendation how to preserve bees. The recommendations include 1) growing flowers, shrubs, and trees, 2) letting the garden grow wild, 3) cutting grass less often, 4) leaving insect nest and hibernation spots alone, and 5) using careful consideration with pesticides.

=== Impact of tourism ===
The impact of human activity has been noted to increase degradation of meadow soil. This has contributed to landslides in Sholas. E.g. due to skiing activities and urbanization, the meadows of the town of Zakopane, Poland, were noted to have altered soil compositions. The soil&#x27;s organic material had faded away and was affected due to the chemicals from the artificial melting water from the snow and skiing machinery.

== Meadows and climate change ==

=== Ecological consequences ===
Climate changes impact temperature precipitation patterns worldwide. The effects are regionally very different but generally, temperatures tend to increase, snowpacks tend to melt earlier and many places tend to become drier. Many species respond to these changes by slowly moving their habitat upwards. The increased elevation decreases mean temperatures and thus allows for species to largely maintain their original habitat. Another common response to changed environmental conditions are &quot;phenological adaptations.&quot; These include shifts in the timing of germination or blossoming. Other examples include for example changing migration patterns of birds of passage. These adaptations are primarily influenced by three drivers:

* Increased temperature
* Changing precipitation patterns
* Reduced snowpack and earlier melting
In the meadows, as water turned out to be all the more scant, that implies less dampness for the plants. The blooming plants do not develop too and hence do not give much food to the creatures. These kinds of changes in the plants could influence population of buffalo just as numerous other more creatures, including bugs and insects.

==== Effects of higher temperatures ====
In response to temperature changes, flowering plants can respond through either spatial or temporal shifts. A spatial shift refers to the migration towards colder areas, often on higher altitudes. A temporal shift means that a plant may alter its phenology to blossom at a different time of the year. By moving towards the early spring or late autumn they can restore their previous temperature conditions. These adaptations are limited through. Spatial shifts may be difficult if the areas are already inhabited by other species, or when the plant is reliant on specific hydrology or soil type. Other authors have shown that higher temperatures can increase total biomass, but temperature shocks and instability seem to have negative impacts on biodiversity. This even appears to be the case for multiyear species, which were previously considered to have a buffering effect on extreme weather events.

==== Effects of changing precipitation patterns ====
There is a variety of hydrological regimes for meadows, ranging from dry to humid, each yielding different plant communities adapted to the respective provider of water. A shift in precipitation patterns has very different effects, depending on the type of meadow. Meadows that are either dry or wet appear to be rather resilient to change, as a moderate increase or decrease in precipitation does not radically alter their character. Meanwhile, mesic meadows, with a moderate supply of water do change their character as it is easier to tip them into a different regime. Dry meadows in particular are threatened by the invasion of shrubs and other woody plants and a decreasing prevalence of flowering forbs, whereas hydric sites tend to lose woody species. Due to the dryer upper soil layers, forbs with shallow roots have difficulties obtaining enough water. Woody plants in contrast with their lower-reaching root systems can still extract water stored in lower soil layers and are able to sustain themselves through longer drought periods with their stored water reserves. In the longer term, changing hydrologic regimes may also facilitate the establishment of invasive species that may be better adapted to the new conditions. The effects are already quite visible, an example is the substitution of Alpine meadows in the southern Himalayas through shrubland. Climate change appears to be an important driver of this process. Wetter winters in contrast might increase total biomass, but favour already competitive species. By harming specialised plants and promoting the prevalence of more generalist species, more unstable precipitation patterns could also reduce ecological biodiversity.

==== Effects of reduced snowpacks ====
Snow covers are directly related to changes in temperature, precipitation and cloud cover. Still, changes in the timing of the snowmelt seem to be, particularly in alpine regions, an important determinant for phenological responses. There is even data suggesting that the impact of snowmelt is even higher than the warming alone. Earlier are not uniformly positive for plants though, as moisture injected through snow-melt might be missing later in the year. Additionally, it might allow for longer periods of seed predation. Problematic is also the lack of the insulating snow cover, springtime frost events might have a larger negative impact.

==== Effects on ecological communities ====
All the drivers mentioned above give rise to complex, non-linear community responses. These responses can be disentangled by looking at multiple climate drivers and species together. As different species show varying degrees of phenological responses, the consequence is a so-called phenological reassembly, where the structure of the ecosystem changes fundamentally. Phenological responses in blossoming periods of certain plants may not coincide with the phenological shifts of their pollinators or growing periods of plant communities relying on each other may start to diverge. A study of meadows in the Rocky Mountains revealed the emergence of a mid-season period with little floral activity. Specifically, the study identified that the typical mid-summer floral peak was composed out of several consecutive peaks in dry, mesic and wet meadow systems. Phenological responses to climate change let these distinct peaks diverge, leading to a gap during mid-summer. This poses a threat to pollinators relying on a continuous supply of floral resources. As ecological communities are often highly adapted to local circumstances which can not be reproduced at higher elevations, Debinski et al. describe the short-term changes observed on meadows &quot;as a shift in the mosaic of the landscape composition&quot;. Therefore, it is important to monitor not only how specific species respond to climate change, but to also investigate them in the context of different habitats they occur in.

=== Phenological reassembly ===
Animals as well as plants are changing rapidly to the anthropogenic global warming, and the number of individuals, habitat occupancy, changing reproductive cycles are the strategies to adapt to this severe and unpredictable environment alterations. The different types of meadows all around the planet are different communities of plants (perennial and annual plants) that constantly are interacting with each other to stay alive and reproduce. Timing and duration of flowering is one of the phenological reassembly driven by many different factors like snow melt, temperature and soil moisture to mention a few. All of the changes that a plant or an animal may go through are depending in habitat&#x27;s topography, altitude, and latitude of a specific organism. It is important to monitor properly the plants because they are one of the best bioindicators of how climate change is affecting the planet.

Flowering phenology is one of the most important features of plant in order to survive any type of adversity. Thanks to different modern techniques and constant monitoring we can assure which ecological strategy the plants are using in order to multiply their species. In alpine meadow of the eastern Tibet notorious variances and similarities were observed between annual and perennial plants. Where perennial plants flowering peak date was directly proportional to the duration and inversely proportional in annuals plants. This is just a limited quantity of many relationships on phenology and functional traits interacting with the environment to survive.

=== Extreme weather ===
Climate change is increasing temperatures all over the world, and boreal regions are more susceptible to suffer noticeable changes. An experiment was conducted to monitor the reaction of alpine arctic meadow plants to different patterns of increased temperatures. This experiment was based on vascular plants that live in arctic and subarctic environments within three different levels of vegetation: canopy layer, bottom layer and functional groups. It is crucial to keep in mind that these plants are usually sharing the space and constantly interacting with bryophytes, lichens, arthropods, animals and many other organisms. The result was a clear adaptation of a constant pattern that plants recognized and had time to reach thermal acclimation meaning that they got a net carbon gain by intensifying photosynthesis and slightly increasing respiration thanks to a warmer climate for a reasonable time period. However, plants that suffer changes of any kind (not only temperature rising and falling) in a short period of time are more likely to die because they did not have enough time to reach thermal acclimation.

=== Meadow restorations ===
==== Carbon storage in meadows ====
Meadows can act as substantial sinks and sources of organic carbon, holding vast quantities of it in the soil. The fluxes of carbon depend mainly on the natural cycle of carbon uptake and efflux, which interplays with seasonal variations (e.g. non-growing vs growing season). The wide range of meadow subtypes have in turn differing attributes (like plant configurations) affecting the area&#x27;s ability to act as sinks; seagrass meadows are for instant identified as some of the more important sinks in the global carbon cycle. In the instance of seagrass meadows, enhanced production of other greenhouse gases (CH4 and N2O) does occur but the estimated overall effect results in an offset of the total emission. Meanwhile, a usual driver of meadow loss (except for direct alterations due to human development) is climate change, consequently increasing carbon emissions and bringing up the topic of restoration projects which in some cases have prompted initiated meadow restorations (e.g. &quot;Zostera marina&quot; meadow in Virginia U.S.A).

==== Grassland degradations ====
Where grassland degradation has occurred, significant alterations to the carbon dioxide efflux during the non-growing season may take place. Both climate change and overgrazing factor into the degradation. As exemplified by the alpine wetland meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, there is the potential of being a moderate source of CO2 and a carbon sink, due to high soil organic content and low decomposition. The more the dynamics have been quantified, however, the effects of degradation become more tangible. A strong connection between grassland degradation and soil carbon loss has been seen, pinpointing that carbon dioxide release is being stimulated by this event. This subsequently indicates a climate change mitigation potential by restoring degraded grassland.

==== Cap-and-trade ====
Being a market-based regulation of emissions, the cap-and-trade system can sometimes incorporate restoration projects for climate mitigation. For example, the cap-and-trade program in California is looking at how meadow restorations can be incorporated into their system of reducing carbon emissions. Audubon&#x27;s preliminary studies point to the potential of storing a substantially increased amount of soil carbon compared to degraded meadows while boosting the local biodiversity. Most recently though, during the COVID-19 pandemic, difficulties with restoration are beginning to show: During the first years, areas under restoration are vulnerable to outside disruption, like meadow management put on hold when the ecosystem is most sensitive, for example to invasive species.

<doc id="371408" wikidata="Q33954" url="?curid=371408" title="Sango language">
<text>Sango (also spelled Sangho) is a major language spoken in Central Africa, especially the Central African Republic, southern Chad and Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is an official language in the Central African Republic, where it is used as a lingua franca across the country and had 450,000 native speakers in 1988. It also has 1.6 million second language speakers.

Sango is a language with contested classification, with some linguists considering it a Ngbandi-based creole, while others argue that the changes in Sango structures can be explained without a creolization process. It has many French loanwords, but its structure remains wholly Ngbandi. Sango was used as a lingua franca for trade along the Ubangi River before French colonisation in the late 1800s and has since expanded as an interethnic communication language. In colloquial speech, almost all of the language&#x27;s vocabulary is Ngbandi based, whereas in more technical speech French loanwords constitute the majority. Sango has three distinct sociolinguistic norms: an urban &quot;radio&quot; variety, a &quot;pastor&quot; variety, and a &quot;functionary&quot; variety spoken by learned people who make the highest use of French loanwords.

Sango is a tonal language with subject-verb-object word order, and its orthography was officially established in 1984. It has limited written material, mainly focused on religious literature. Sango is considered easy to learn, although reaching true fluency takes time, as with any other language. The main difficulties for English speakers are pronunciation and tone management.

== Classification ==
Some linguists, following William J. Samarin, classify it as a Ngbandi-based creole; however, others (like Marcel Diki-Kidiri, Charles H. Morrill) reject that classification and say that changes in Sango structures (both internally and externally) can be explained quite well without a creolization process.

According to the creolization hypothesis, Sango is exceptional in that it is an African- rather than European-based creole. Although French has contributed numerous loanwords, Sango&#x27;s structure is wholly African.

== History ==

A variety of Sango was used as a lingua franca along the Ubangi River before French colonization, in the late 1800s. The French army recruited Central Africans, causing them to increasingly use Sango as a means of interethnic communication. Throughout the 20th century, missionaries promoted Sango because of its wide usage.

Originally used by river traders, Sango arose as a lingua franca based on the Northern Ngbandi dialect of the Sango tribe, part of the Ngbandi language cluster, with some French influence.

The rapid growth of the city of Bangui since the 1960s has had significant implications for the development of Sango, with the creation, for the first time, of a population of first-language speakers. Whereas rural immigrants to the city spoke many different languages and used Sango only as a lingua franca, their children use Sango as their main (and sometimes only) language. That has led to a rapid expansion of the lexicon, including both formal and slang terms. Also, its new position as the everyday language of the capital city has led to Sango gaining greater status and being used increasingly in fields for which it was previously the norm to use French.

== Geographic distribution ==
Sango is widespread in the Central African Republic, with 350,000 speakers at the 1970 census. It is also spoken as a lingua franca in southern Chad, where it is probably not spoken natively and its use is decreasing, and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where its use is increasing.

Today, Sango is both a national and official language of the Central African Republic, which makes the Central African Republic one of the few African countries to have an indigenous language as an official language.

== Registers ==
A study by Taber (1964) indicates that some 490 native Sango words account for about 90% of colloquial speech; however, while French loanwords are much more rarely used, they account for the majority of the vocabulary, particularly in the speech of learned people. The situation might be compared to English, in which most of the vocabulary, particularly &quot;learned&quot; words, is derived from Latin, Greek, or French while the basic vocabulary remains strongly Germanic. However, more recent studies suggest that the result is specific to a particular sociolect, the so-called &quot;functionary&quot; variety. Morrill&#x27;s work, completed in 1997, revealed that there were three sociologically distinct norms emerging in the Sango language: an urban &quot;radio&quot; variety which is ranked by 80% of his interviewees and has very few French loan words; a so-called &quot;pastor&quot; variety, which is scored 60%; and a &quot;functionary&quot; variety, spoken by learned people, who make the highest use of French loanwords while speaking Sango, which scores 40%.

== Phonology ==
=== Vowels ===
Sango has seven oral and five nasal vowels. Vowel quality and number of nasalized vowels may be affected by the mother tongue of non-native speakers of Sango.

=== Consonants ===
Palatal affricates occur in loan words and certain dialects. Some dialects have alternations between [ᶬv] and [m], [ᵐb] and [ᵑ͡ᵐg͡b], [ᵐb] and [b], word-medial [l] and [r], and word-initial [h] and [ʔ]. [ᶬv] is quite rare.

=== Syllable structure ===
Syllable structure is generally CV. Consecutive vowels are rare but do occur. Consonants may be palatalized or labialized, orthographically C and C, respectively.

Words are generally monosyllabic or bisyllabic but less commonly are trisyllabic. Four-syllable words are created via reduplication and compounding, and may also be written as two words (&quot;kêtêkêtê&quot; or &quot;kêtê kêtê&quot; &#x27;tiny bit&#x27;, &quot;walikundû&quot; or &quot;wa likundû&quot; &#x27;sorcerer&#x27;).

=== Tone ===
Sango is a tonal language. The language has three basic tones (high, mid, and low), with contour tones also occurring, generally in French loanwords. Tones have a low functional load, but minimal pairs exist: &quot;dü&quot; &#x27;give birth&#x27; versus &quot;dû&quot; &#x27;hole&#x27;.

Monosyllabic loan words from French usually have the tone pattern high-low falling (&quot;bâan&quot; &#x27;bench&#x27; from French &quot;banc&quot;). In multisyllabic words all syllables carry low tone except the final syllable, which is lengthened and takes a descending tone. The final tone is generally mid-low falling for nouns (&quot;ananäa&quot; &#x27;pineapple&#x27; from French &quot;ananas&quot;) and high-low falling for verbs (&quot;aretêe&quot; &#x27;to stop&#x27; from French &quot;arrêter&quot;).

In isolation, tones have idiolectal variation, and they may also be affected by the mother language of non-native speakers.

== Grammar ==
Sango is an isolating language with subject–verb–object word order, as in English. Noun phrases are of the form determiner-adjective-noun:

Plurals are marked with the proclitic &quot;â-&quot;, which precedes noun phrases:

&quot;â-&quot; may be attached to multiple items in the noun phrase by some speakers, but this is less common:

The derivational suffix &quot;-ngö&quot; nominalizes verbs. It also changes all tones in the verb to mid:

Genitives are normally formed with the preposition &quot;tî&quot; &#x27;of&#x27;:

However, compounding is becoming increasingly common: &quot;dûngü&quot; &#x27;well&#x27; (note the change in tone). Such compounds are sometimes written as two separate words.

The verbal prefix &quot;a-&quot; is used when the subject is a noun or noun phrase but not when the subject is either a pronoun or implicit (as in imperatives):



The prefix is sometimes written as a separate word.

The pronouns are &quot;mbï&quot; &quot;I&quot;, &quot;mo&quot; &quot;you (singular)&quot;, &quot;lo&quot; &quot;he, she, it&quot;, &quot;ë&quot; &quot;we&quot;, &quot;ï&quot; &quot;you (plural)&quot;, &quot;âla&quot; &quot;you (plural)&quot;, &quot;âla&quot; &quot;they&quot;. Verbs take a prefix &quot;a-&quot; if not preceded by a pronoun: &quot;mo yeke&quot; &quot;you are&quot; but &quot;Bêafrîka ayeke&quot; &quot;Central Africa is&quot;. Particularly useful verbs include &quot;yeke&quot; &quot;be&quot;, &quot;bara&quot; &quot;greet&quot; (&quot;bara o&quot; &quot;hi!&quot;), &quot;hînga&quot; &quot;know&quot;. Possessives and appositives are formed with the word &quot;tî&quot; &quot;of&quot;: &quot;ködörö tî mbï&quot; &quot;my country&quot;, &quot;yângâ tî sängö&quot; &quot;Sango language&quot;. Another common preposition is &quot;na&quot;, covering a variety of locative, dative, and instrumental functions.

== Orthography ==
Sango began being written by French missionaries, with Catholic and Protestant conventions differing slightly. The 1966 Bible and 1968 hymnal were highly influential and still used today.

In 1984, President André Kolingba signed &quot;Décret No 84.025&quot;, establishing an official orthography for Sango. The official Sango alphabet consists of 22 letters:

Letters are pronounced as their IPA equivalent except for , pronounced as [j]. Also, the digraphs are pronounced , , , , , , and , respectively.

, , and may be used in loan words not fully integrated into Sango&#x27;s phonological system.

The official orthography contains the following consonants: : some add for the implosive . Sango has seven oral vowels, , of which five, , occur nasalized. In the official orthography, stands for both and , and stands for both and ; nasal vowels are written .

Sango has three tones: low, mid, and high. In standard orthography, low tone is unmarked, , mid tone is marked with diaeresis, , and high tone with circumflex, : &quot;do-re-mi&quot; would be written .

Sango has little written material apart from religious literature, but some basic literacy material has been developed.

Sango is considered unusually easy to learn; according to Samarin, &quot;with application a student ought to be able to speak the language in about three months.&quot; However, reaching true fluency takes much longer, as with any other language.

For English-speakers there are two main difficulties. One must remember not to split double consonants: Bambari, for example, must be pronounced ba-mba-ri, not bam-ba-ri. Also, as with any other tonal language, one must learn not to vary the tone according to the context. For example, if one pronounces a question with a rising tone as in English, one may inadvertently be saying an entirely different and inappropriate Sango word at the end of the sentence.

<text>David Lorge Parnas (born February 10, 1941) is a Canadian early pioneer of software engineering, who developed the concept of information hiding in modular programming, which is an important element of object-oriented programming today. He is also noted for his advocacy of precise documentation.

==Life==
Parnas earned his PhD at Carnegie Mellon University in electrical engineering. Parnas also earned a professional engineering license in Canada and was one of the first to apply traditional engineering principles to software design.
He worked there as a professor for many years. He also taught at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (U.S.), at the Department of Computer Science of the Technische Universität Darmstadt (Germany), the University of Victoria (British Columbia, Canada), Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario, McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, and University of Limerick (Republic of Ireland).

David Parnas received a number of awards and honors:

* ACM &quot;Best Paper&quot; Award, 1979
* Norbert Wiener Award for Social and Professional Responsibility, 1987
* Two &quot;Most Influential Paper&quot; awards International Conference on Software Engineering, 1991 and 1995
* Doctor honoris causa of the Computer Science Department, ETH Zurich, Switzerland, 1986
* Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, 1992
* Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery, 1994
* Doctor honoris causa of the Louvain School of Engineering, University of Louvain (UCLouvain), Belgium, 1996
* ACM SIGSOFT&#x27;s &quot;Outstanding Research&quot; award, 1998
* IEEE Computer Society&#x27;s 60th Anniversary Award, 2007
* Doctor honoris causa of the Faculty of Informatics, University of Lugano, Switzerland, 2008
* Fellow of the Gesellschaft für Informatik, 2008
* Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), 2009
* Doctor honoris causa of the Vienna University of Technology (Dr. Tech.H.C.), Vienna Austria, 2011

==Work==

===Modular design===
In modular design, his double dictum of high cohesion within modules and loose coupling between modules is fundamental to modular design in software. However, in Parnas&#x27;s seminal 1972 paper &quot;On the Criteria to Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules&quot;, this dictum is expressed in terms of information hiding, and the terms &quot;cohesion&quot; and &quot;coupling&quot; are not used. He never used them. 

===Technical activism===
Dr Parnas took a public stand against the US Strategic Defense Initiative (also known as &quot;Star Wars&quot;) in the mid 1980s, arguing that it would be impossible to write an application of sufficient quality that it could be trusted to prevent a nuclear attack. He has also been in the forefront of those urging the professionalization of &quot;software engineering&quot; (a term that he characterizes as &quot;an unconsummated marriage&quot;). Dr. Parnas is also a heavy promoter of ethics in the field of software engineering.

===Stance on academic evaluation methods===
Parnas has joined the group of scientists which openly criticize the number-of-publications-based approach towards ranking academic production. On his November 2007 paper &quot;Stop the Numbers Game&quot;, he elaborates on several reasons on why the current number-based academic evaluation system used in many fields by universities all over the world (be it either oriented to the amount of publications or the amount of quotations each of those get) is flawed and, instead of contributing to scientific progress, it leads to knowledge stagnation.

<doc id="371414" wikidata="Q1529116" url="?curid=371414" title="Good King Wenceslas">
<text>&quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot; (Roud number 24754) is a Christmas carol that tells a story of a tenth-century king of Bohemia (modern-day Czech Republic) who goes on a journey, braving harsh winter weather, to give alms to a poor peasant on the Feast of Stephen. During the journey, his page is about to give up the struggle against the cold weather, but is enabled to continue by following the king&#x27;s footprints, step for step, through the deep snow.

The legend is based on a story about Saint Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia (907–935), who was not in fact a king.

In 1853, English hymnwriter John Mason Neale wrote the lyrics in collaboration with his music editor Thomas Helmore to fit the melody of the 13th-century spring carol &quot;Tempus adest floridum&quot; (&quot;Eastertime Is Come&quot;), which they had found in the 1582 Finnish song collection &quot;Piae Cantiones&quot;. The carol first appeared in &quot;Carols for Christmas-Tide&quot;, published by Novello &amp; Co the same year.

== &quot;On the Feast of Stephen&quot; ==
In Western Christianity, the Feast of Stephen is December 26, the Second Day of Christmas; in Eastern Christianity, it is December 27. During Wenceslas&#x27;s time, the Julian Calendar was in use. During the 900s, the day that they called December 26 was actually December 31 according to the Gregorian Calendar (the current calendar). And the day that they called December 27 was January 1.

==Source legend==
Wenceslas was considered a martyr and a saint immediately after his death in the 10th century, when a cult of Wenceslas rose up in Bohemia and in England. Within a few decades of Wenceslas&#x27;s death, four biographies of him were in circulation. These hagiographies had a powerful influence on the High Middle Ages conceptualization of the &quot;rex iustus&quot;, or &quot;righteous king&quot;—that is, a monarch whose power stems mainly from his great piety, as well as from his princely vigor.

Referring approvingly to these hagiographies, a preacher from the 12th century wrote:

Several centuries later the legend was claimed as fact by Pope Pius II, who himself also walked ten miles barefoot in the ice and snow as an act of pious thanksgiving.

Although Wenceslas was, during his lifetime, only a duke, Holy Roman Emperor Otto I (962–973) posthumously &quot;conferred on [Wenceslas] the regal dignity and title&quot; and that is why, in the legend and song, he is referred to as a &quot;king&quot;. The usual English spelling of Duke Wenceslas&#x27;s name, &quot;Wenceslaus&quot;, is occasionally encountered in later textual variants of the carol, although it was not used by Neale in his version. Wenceslas is not to be confused with King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia (Wenceslaus I Premyslid), who lived more than three centuries later.

A statue of Saint Wenceslas on horseback can be found at the Wenceslas Square, in Prague.

==History==

===Authorship===

====Tempus adest floridum====

The tune is that of &quot;Tempus adest floridum&quot; (&quot;Eastertime has come&quot;), a 13th-century spring carol in 76 76 Doubled Trochaic metre, first published in the Finnish song book &quot;Piae Cantiones&quot; in 1582. &quot;Piae Cantiones&quot; is a collection of seventy-four songs compiled by Jacobus Finno, the Protestant headmaster of Turku Cathedral School, and published by Theodoric Petri, a young Catholic printer. The book is a unique document of European songs intended not only for use in church, but also schools, thus making the collection a unique record of the late medieval period.

A text beginning substantially the same as the 1582 &quot;Piae&quot; version is also found in the German manuscript collection &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; as &quot;CB 142&quot;, where it is substantially more carnal; &quot;CB 142&quot; has clerics and virgins playing the &quot;game of Venus&quot; (goddess of love) in the meadows, while in the &quot;Piae&quot; version they are praising the Lord from the bottom of their hearts. The tune has also been used for the Christmas hymn &quot;Mary Gently Laid Her Child&quot;, by Joseph S. Cook (1859–1933); GIA Publications&#x27;s hymnal &quot;Worship&quot; uses &quot;Tempus Adest Floridum&quot; only for Cook&#x27;s hymn.

===Neale&#x27;s carol===

In 1853, English hymnwriter John Mason Neale wrote the &quot;Wenceslas&quot; lyric, in collaboration with his music editor Thomas Helmore, and the carol first appeared in &quot;Carols for Christmas-Tide&quot;, published by Novello &amp; Co the same year.

The text of Neale&#x27;s carol bears no relation to the words of &quot;Tempus Adest Floridum&quot;. In or around 1853, G. J. R. Gordon, the British envoy and minister in Stockholm, gave a rare copy of the 1582 edition of &quot;Piae Cantiones&quot; to Neale, who was Warden of Sackville College, East Grinstead, Sussex and to the Reverend Thomas Helmore (Vice-Principal of St. Mark&#x27;s College, Chelsea).

The book was entirely unknown in England at that time. As a member of the Tractarian Oxford Movement, Neale was interested in restoring Catholic ceremony, saints days, and music back into the Anglican church. The gift from G. J. R. Gordon gave him the opportunity to use medieval Catholic melodies for Anglican hymn writing.

In 1849 he had published &quot;Deeds of Faith: Stories for Children from Church History&quot; which recounted legends from Christian tradition in Romantic prose. One of the chapters told the legend of St Wenceslas and his footsteps melting the snow for his page:

:&quot;My liege,&quot; he said, &quot;I cannot go on. The wind freezes my very blood. Pray you, let us return.&quot;
&quot;Seems it so much?&quot; asked the King. &quot;Was not His journey from Heaven a wearier and a colder way than this?&quot;
:Otto answered not.
&quot;Follow me on still,&quot; said S. Wenceslaus. &quot;Only tread in my footsteps, and you will proceed more easily.&quot;
:The servant knew that his master spoke not at random. He carefully looked for the footsteps of the King: he set his own feet in the print of his lord&#x27;s feet.
For his 1853 publication &quot;Carols for Christmas-tide&quot;, he adapted his earlier prose story into a poem, and together with the music editor Thomas Helmore added the words to the melody in &quot;Piae Cantiones&quot;, adding a reference to Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day (26 December), making it suitable for performance on that Saint&#x27;s Day.

The hymn&#x27;s lyrics take the form of five eight-line stanzas in four-stress lines. Each stanza has an ABABCDCD rhyme scheme. Lines 1, 3, 5, and 7 end in single-syllable (so-called masculine) rhymes, and lines 2, 4, 6, and 8 with two-syllable (&quot;feminine&quot;) rhymes. (In the English tradition, two-syllable rhymes are generally associated with light or comic verse, which may be part of the reason some critics have demeaned Neale&#x27;s lyrics as &quot;doggerel&quot;.)

In the music the two-syllable rhymes in lines 2, 4, and 6 (e.g. &quot;Stephen/even&quot;, &quot;cruel/fuel&quot;) are set to two half-notes (British &quot;minims&quot;), but the final rhyme of each stanza (line 8) is spread over two full measures, the first syllable as two half-notes and the second as a whole note (&quot;semi-breve&quot;)—so &quot;fuel&quot; is set as &quot;fu-&quot; with two half-notes and &quot;-el&quot; with a whole-note. Thus, unusually, the final musical line differs from all the others in having not two but three measures of 4/4 time.

Some academics are critical of Neale&#x27;s textual substitution. H. J. L. J. Massé wrote in 1921:

Why, for instance, do we tolerate such impositions as &quot;Good King Wenceslas?&quot; The original was and is an Easter Hymn...it is marked in carol books as &quot;traditional&quot;, a delightful word which often conceals ignorance. There is nothing traditional in it as a carol.

A similar sentiment is expressed by the editors (Percy Dearmer, Martin Shaw and Ralph Vaughan Williams) in the 1928 &quot;Oxford Book of Carols&quot;, which is even more critical of Neale&#x27;s carol:

This rather confused narrative owes its popularity to the delightful tune, which is that of a Spring carol. . . . Unfortunately Neale in 1853 substituted for the Spring carol this &#x27;Good King Wenceslas&#x27;, one of his less happy pieces, which E. Duncan goes so far as to call &#x27;doggerel&#x27;, and Bullen condemns as &#x27;poor and commonplace to the last degree&#x27;. The time has not yet come for a comprehensive book to discard it; but we reprint the tune in its proper setting . . . not without hope that, with the present wealth of carols for Christmas, &#x27;Good King Wenceslas&#x27; may gradually pass into disuse, and the tune be restored to spring-time.

Elizabeth Poston, in the &quot;Penguin Book of Christmas Carols&quot;, refers to the song as the &quot;product of an unnatural marriage between Victorian whimsy and the thirteenth-century dance carol&quot;. She goes on to say that Neale&#x27;s &quot;ponderous moral doggerel&quot; does not fit the lighthearted dance measure of the original tune, and that if performed in the correct manner it &quot;sounds ridiculous to pseudo-religious words&quot;. A similar development has occurred with the song &quot;O Christmas Tree,&quot; the tune of which has been used for &quot;Maryland, My Maryland,&quot; &quot;The Red Flag,&quot; and other unrelated songs.

By contrast, Brian Scott, quoting from &quot;The Oxford Book of Carols&quot; its criticism and hope that the carol would &quot;pass into disuse&quot;, argues: &quot;Thankfully, they were wrong&quot;, for the carol &quot;still reminds us that the giving spirit of Christmas should not happen just on that day. . . .&quot; Jeremy Summerly and Nicolas Bell of the British Museum also strongly rebut Dearmer&#x27;s 20th century criticism, noting: &quot;it could have been awful, but it isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s magical . . . you remember it because the verse just works&quot;.

<text>The Heck or Munich-Berlin is a German breed or type of domestic cattle. It was bred in the 1920s by Heinz and Lutz Heck in an attempt to breed back the extinct aurochs (&quot;Bos primigenius&quot;). Controversy revolves around methodology and success of the programme. There are considerable differences between Heck cattle and the aurochs in build, height, and body proportions. Furthermore, there are other cattle breeds which resemble their wild ancestors at least as much as Heck cattle.

== History ==

Heck cattle originated in Germany in the 1920s and 1930s in an attempt to breed back domestic cattle to their ancestral form: the aurochs (&quot;Bos primigenius primigenius&quot;). In the first years of the Weimar Republic, the brothers Heinz and Lutz Heck independently started their extensive breeding-back programmes. 

Their motivation was to rescue the aurochs from oblivion because it was constantly confused with the European bison, the other large bovine of Holocene Europe. The Heck brothers believed that creating a look-alike and showing both species next to each other would help to show the difference between the two species to a broader public. Apart from that, they believed they were able to reconstruct the species and therefore to correct the mistake man made when killing the species off.

Heinz was the director of the Hellabrunn Zoological Gardens in Munich and Lutz of the Berlin Zoological Gardens. Only eleven years after they started their breeding experiments, just as the Weimar Republic was drawing to a close, they each announced success. 

Lutz Heck used Spanish Fighting Bulls for his breed, some of which were released in the Polish Romincka Forest, but survived until the late 1940s when they were killed during the end of the Second World War. Rewilding Lutz Heck&#x27;s cattle breed was met with objection since the beginnings of this project, as these cattle were aggressive and their ecological impact on the native fauna was considered to be unpredictable. Later rewilding attempts in Poland were rejected.

Lutz Heck&#x27;s cattle were exterminated at the end of the Second World war. Heinz Heck used a different set of breeds; all living Heck cattle go back to his stock. The ancestral breeds used by Heinz Heck include:
* Hungarian Grey
* Highland cattle
* Corsican cattle
* Murnau-Werdenfels
* Angeln cattle
* German Black Pied cattle
* White Park cattle
* Brown Swiss

In 1932 the first bull that Heinz Heck believed to resemble the aurochs was born and named Glachl. He was a 75% Corsican and 25% (Gray cattle × Lowland × Highland × Angeln) cross. This bull and his father were subsequently bred into further breeds to increase weight. As a consequence most modern Heck cattle go back to Central European dairy and beef cattle that were supplemented by cattle from other regions. Advocates of Heck cattle often claim that Heinz&#x27; and Lutz&#x27; breeding results looked largely identical, thus &quot;proving the success&quot; of their experiment. However, Berlin and Munich Heck cattle did not look very similar.

=== Distribution ===

There are about cattle in Europe, and a few elsewhere. Heck cattle are found in German zoos because of the erroneous claim by the Heck brothers that these cattle represent resurrected aurochs and are suitable for conservation projects today. In Oostvaardersplassen in Flevoland (Netherlands), about 600 Heck cattle roam freely. Weak animals are shot by hunters in order to prevent unnecessary suffering. Others are at the Falkenthaler Rieselfelder near Berlin, at the Nesseaue nature reserve near Jena, Thuringia and at the Grubenfelder Leonie nature reserve in Auerbach, Bavaria. About 100 were registered in France in 2000. The introduction of Heck cattle into nature reserves in order to restore ancient landscapes inspired Rewilding Europe. The way of no interference in the Oostvaardersplassen, however, was terminated in 2018, as large numbers of animals died of starvation during the cold winters of 2005 and 2010, which caused a loss of public support. A small population of Hecks lives in the Beremytske Nature Park in the Chernihiv region of Ukraine.

=== Criticism ===

Criticism of the methodology and result of the Heck brothers&#x27; programs dates back to at least the 1950s. Cis van Vuure describes the work of W. Herre in 1953 and O. Koehler in 1952:

: A lack of basic knowledge about the extinct aurochs, broad selection criteria ... and the rich imagination and complacency of the two brothers led to their excessive simplification of the breeding-back procedure.

Criticism also focused on the carelessness, the ease and the speed with which they had carried out their experiments as well as the genetic basis. Cis van Vuure further stated that:

: On account of the absence of any marked similarity in size, colour, and horn shape, among other aspects, Heck cattle cannot be considered to resemble the aurochs closely. Rather they should be seen as a population of cattle in which a few aurochs characteristics may be found; a trait they share with many other cattle populations.

In the view of some experts, primitive Southern European cattle breeds are much closer overall to the aurochs than Heck cattle, such as the Spanish fighting bull.

== Characteristics ==

A typical bull stands on average tall, and a cow , with weight up to . Heck cattle are twenty to thirty centimeters shorter than the aurochs they were bred to resemble. Heck bulls are not larger than other domestic bulls and actually a little smaller than cattle used in modern intensive agriculture, whilst aurochs bulls reached shoulder heights of between 160 and 180 and in rare cases even 200 cm. Aurochs bulls are believed to have weighed some .

Size is not the only aspect in which Heck cattle differ from their wild ancestor. Heck cattle are bulky like many other domestic breeds, whilst the aurochs, as a wild bovine, had an athletic body shape. The legs of Heck cattle are shorter and the trunk much longer than in the aurochs, in which shoulder height and trunk length nearly equalled each other. Heck cattle have a comparatively small and short head, whilst aurochs had a large elongated head sitting on a muscular neck. Aurochs had well-developed shoulder musculature, carried by long spines, which is absent in Heck cattle. All in all, proportions and body shape of Heck cattle are not significantly similar to the aurochs and do not differ from many other domestic breeds.

The horns of the aurochs had a characteristic and relatively stable shape. At the base they grew outwards-upwards, then forwards-inwards and inwards-upwards at the tips. Aurochs horns were large and thick overall, reaching in length and or more in diameter. However the horns of Heck cattle differ in many respects. Usually they curve too much upwards or outwards compared with the original or do not reach the length or diameter of the aurochs. Often the horns of Heck cattle strongly resemble the breeds it was created from (i.e. Grey Cattle).

In coat colour Heck cattle may resemble the aurochs, the bulls having a black overall coat colour with a light eel stripe and cows displaying a reddish-brown colour. However some Heck bulls may have a light-coloured saddle (which was apparently not present in the European aurochs) and the sexual dimorphism in colour is unclear in most cases; bulls and cows may be dark with a light-coloured saddle, black cows appear regularly and light-coloured bulls are no rarity. There are other deviant colours too, such as individuals having a grayish or gray colour and cows being beige. White patches, typical of pied dairy breeds, appear as well, sometimes to the same extent as in Holstein cattle.

Heck cattle demonstrate a higher amount of heterogeneity than any wild animal or most other domestic breeds. There is considerable variation in coat colour, horn shape and horn dimensions, as well as size and proportions. Besides the features that are desired because they bear resemblance to the aurochs, numerous divergent features may appear (as explained above).

Heck cattle differ in many respects from the aurochs, and there are breeds that resemble the aurochs at least as much, such as the Spanish fighting bull. Nevertheless, they are capable of coping in the wild with cold temperatures or nutrient-poor food. On the other hand, there are other robust cattle breeds that cope with harsh conditions at least as well as Heck cattle, and feral cattle are no rarity.

== Use ==

Heck cattle have been used in breeding-back projects aimed at creating cattle with closer similarity to the aurochs, such as the German Projekt Taurus and the Dutch Tauros Programme.

<doc id="371422" wikidata="Q34014" url="?curid=371422" title="Swazi language">
<text>Swazi or siSwati is a Bantu language of the Nguni group spoken in Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) and South Africa by the Swati people. The number of speakers is estimated to be in the region of 4.7 million including first and second language speakers. The language is taught in Eswatini and some South African schools in Mpumalanga, particularly former KaNgwane areas. Siswati is an official language of Eswatini (along with English), and is also one of the twelve official languages of South Africa.

The official term is &quot;siSwati&quot; among native speakers; in English, Zulu, Ndebele or Xhosa it may be referred to as &quot;Swazi&quot;. siSwati is most closely related to the other Tekela languages, like Phuthi and Northern Transvaal (Sumayela) Ndebele, but is also very close to the Zunda languages: Zulu, Southern Ndebele, Northern Ndebele, and Xhosa.

==Dialects==
Siswati spoken in Eswatini can be divided into four dialects corresponding to the four administrative regions of the country: Hhohho, Lubombo, Manzini, and Shiselweni.

Siswati has at least two varieties: the standard, prestige variety spoken mainly in the north, centre and southwest of the country, and a less prestigious variety spoken elsewhere.

In the far south, especially in towns such as Nhlangano and Hlatikhulu, the variety of the language spoken is significantly influenced by isiZulu. Many Swazis (plural , singular ), including those in the south who speak this variety, do not regard it as &#x27;proper&#x27; Swazi. This is what may be referred to as the second dialect in the country. The sizeable number of Swazi speakers in South Africa (mainly in the Mpumalanga province, and in Soweto) are considered by Eswatini Swazi speakers to speak a non-standard form of the language.

Unlike the variant in the south of Eswatini, the Mpumalanga variety appears to be less influenced by Zulu, and is thus considered closer to standard Swazi. However, this Mpumalanga variety is distinguishable by distinct intonation, and perhaps distinct tone patterns. Intonation patterns (and informal perceptions of &#x27;stress&#x27;) in Mpumalanga Swazi are often considered discordant to the Swazi ear. This South African variety of Swazi is considered to exhibit influence from other South African languages spoken close to Swazi.

A feature of the standard prestige variety of Swazi (spoken in the north and centre of Eswatini) is the royal style of slow, heavily stressed enunciation, which is anecdotally claimed to have a &#x27;mellifluous&#x27; feel to its hearers.

== Phonology ==
===Vowels===
===Consonants===

Swazi does not distinguish between places of articulation in its clicks. They are dental (as ) or might also be alveolar (as ). It does, however, distinguish five or six manners of articulation and phonation, including tenuis, aspirated, voiced, breathy voiced, nasal, and breathy-voiced nasal.

The consonants each have two sounds. and can both occur as ejective sounds, and , and their other common allophones are and . The sound differs when at the beginning of stems as , and commonly as within words.

===Tone===
Swazi exhibits three surface tones: high, mid and low. Tone is unwritten in the standard orthography. Traditionally, only the high and mid tones are taken to exist phonemically, with the low tone conditioned by a preceding depressor consonant. Bradshaw (2003) however argues that all three tones exist underlyingly.

Phonological processes acting on tone include:
* When a stem with non-high tone receives a prefix with underlying high tone, this high tone moves to the antepenult (or to the penult, when the onset of the antepenult is a depressor).
* High spread: all syllables between two high tones become high, as long as no depressor intervenes. This happens not only word-internally, but also across a word boundary between a verb and its object.

The depressor consonants are all voiced obstruents other than . The allophone of appears to behave as a depressor for some rules but not others.

<text>Touchstone Pictures was an American film production label of Walt Disney Studios, founded and owned by The Walt Disney Company. Feature films released under the Touchstone label were produced and financed by Walt Disney Studios, and featured more mature themes targeted at adult audiences than typical Walt Disney Pictures films. As such, Touchstone was merely a pseudonym label for the studio and did not exist as a distinct business operation.

Established on February 15, 1984, by then-Disney CEO Ron W. Miller as Touchstone Films, Touchstone operated as an active film production division of Disney during the mid 1980s through the early 2010s, releasing a majority of the studio&#x27;s PG-13 and R-rated films. In 2009, Disney entered into a five-year, thirty-picture distribution deal with DreamWorks Pictures under which DreamWorks&#x27; productions would be released through the Touchstone banner; the label then distributed DreamWorks&#x27; films from 2011 to 2016. Following the release of &quot;The Light Between Oceans&quot; (2016), the final film of the DreamWorks deal, the Touchstone label was retired.

== History ==
=== Background and conception ===
Due to the increased public assumption that Disney films were aimed at children and families, films produced by Walt Disney Productions began to falter at the box office. This began in 1975 with the release of &quot;Escape to Witch Mountain&quot; and its 1978 sequel. In late 1979, Walt Disney Productions released &quot;The Black Hole&quot;, a science-fiction movie that was the studio&#x27;s first production to receive a PG rating (the company, however, had already distributed via Buena Vista Distribution its first PG-rated film, &quot;Take Down&quot;, almost a year before the release of &quot;The Black Hole&quot;).

Over the next few years, Disney experimented with more PG-rated fare, such as the horror-mystery &quot;The Watcher in the Woods&quot;, the spy-themed comedy &quot;Condorman&quot;, and the Paramount Pictures co-produced fantasy epic &quot;Dragonslayer&quot;. With Disney&#x27;s 1982 slate of PG-rated films, which included the thriller drama &quot;Night Crossing&quot; and the science-fiction film &quot;Tron&quot;, the company lost over $27 million. &quot;Tron&quot; was considered a potential &quot;Star Wars&quot;-level success by the production company.

In late 1982, Disney vice president of production Tom Wilhite announced that they would produce and release more mature films under a new brand. Wilhite elaborated to &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;We won&#x27;t get into horror or exploitive sex, but using a non-Disney name will allow us wider latitude in the maturity of the subject matter and the edge we can add to the humor.&quot; He stated that one of the first films that would be released under this new brand was &quot;Trenchcoat&quot;, a comedy caper starring Margot Kidder and Robert Hays; however, the new brand had not yet been created by the time of the film&#x27;s release in March 1983, so it was instead released by Walt Disney Productions, but with no production company credited in the released prints.

The company registered a loss of $33 million in 1983, resulting primarily from such films as the adaptation of Ray Bradbury&#x27;s horror-fantasy novel &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot;, the horror-comedy &quot;The Devil and Max Devlin&quot; starring Elliott Gould and Bill Cosby, and the dramas &quot;Tex&quot; and &quot;Never Cry Wolf&quot;, the latter a PG release that featured male nudity, which did well as the studio downplayed the film&#x27;s association with the Disney brand.

=== Touchstone Films ===
Touchstone Films was founded by then-Disney CEO Ron W. Miller on February 15, 1984, as a label for their PG films, with an expected three to four movies released under the label. Touchstone Films&#x27; first film was &quot;Splash&quot;, a huge hit that grossed $68 million at the domestic box office that year. Touchstone Films was a brand chosen from over 1,200 potential names; the runner-up name was &quot;Silver Wind&quot;. Incoming Disney CEO Michael Eisner and film chief Jeffrey Katzenberg considered renaming the label to &quot;Hollywood Pictures&quot;, which went on to become a separate Disney film label on February 1, 1989.

In 1986, &quot;Down and Out in Beverly Hills&quot; was another early success for Touchstone and was Disney&#x27;s first R-rated film. It was followed in 1987 by Disney&#x27;s first PG-13-rated film, &quot;Adventures in Babysitting&quot;. Disney increased the momentum with additional PG-13 and R-rated films with &quot;Ruthless People&quot; (1986), &quot;Outrageous Fortune&quot; (1987), &quot;Tin Men&quot; (1987), and other top movies. In April 1986, Touchstone films were licensed to Showtime/The Movie Channel for five years, starting in 1987.

=== Renomination ===
Touchstone Films was renamed Touchstone Pictures after the release of &quot;Ruthless People&quot; in 1986. With Touchstone films, Disney moved to the top of box office receipts, beating out all the other major film studios by 1988. On April 13, 1988, Touchstone became a unit of Walt Disney Pictures under newly appointed president Ricardo Mestres. On October 23, 1990, Disney formed Touchwood Pacific Partners I to supplant the Silver Screen Partners partnership series as their movie studios&#x27; primary funding source.

With several production companies getting out of film production or closing shop by December 2, 1988, the Walt Disney Studios announced the formation of the Hollywood Pictures division, which would only share marketing and distribution with Touchstone, to fill the void. Mestres was appointed president of Hollywood. On July 27, 1992, Touchstone agreed to an exclusive, first-look production and distribution agreement with Merchant Ivory Productions for three years.

Following the success of the Disney-branded PG-13-rated &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot; in 2003 and other films that in the 1980s and 1990s would have been released as Touchstone or Hollywood Pictures films, Disney weighed distribution of films more toward Disney-branded films and away from Touchstone, though (before 2016) not entirely disbanding them as it continued to use the Touchstone label for R and most PG-13-rated fare. In 2006, Disney limited Touchstone&#x27;s output to two or three films in favor of Walt Disney Pictures titles due to an increase in film industry costs. Disney indicated scaling back on using multiple brands in 2007 with the renaming of Touchstone Television to ABC Television Studio in February and the outright elimination of the Buena Vista brand in April. On January 14, 2010, Sean Bailey was appointed president of live-action production at Walt Disney Studios, overseeing all films produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Touchstone Pictures.

=== DreamWorks deal and dormancy===
In 2009, Disney entered into a distribution deal with DreamWorks Studios and repurposed Touchstone as a distribution label for DreamWorks films. Disney provided $100 million in financing to DreamWorks productions and an additional $75 million credit line if DreamWorks could not get additional equity funding. In January 2012, Disney was reportedly in the early stages of considering Touchstone&#x27;s fate, including a possible sale.

Following Disney&#x27;s decision not to renew their long-standing deal with Jerry Bruckheimer Films in 2013, producer Jerry Bruckheimer revealed that he insisted on revitalizing the Touchstone label for production. Disney was uninterested, with studio chairman Alan Horn admitting that Touchstone&#x27;s output had been reduced to only distributing DreamWorks&#x27; films as those films were in the label&#x27;s interest. In addition to DreamWorks&#x27; films, Touchstone also released non-Disney-branded animated films such as &quot;Gnomeo &amp; Juliet&quot;, &quot;The Wind Rises&quot;, and &quot;Strange Magic&quot;.

By the end of the DreamWorks deal in August 2016, Disney had distributed 14 of DreamWorks&#x27; original 30-picture agreement, with thirteen through Touchstone. The deal ended with &quot;The Light Between Oceans&quot; being the final theatrical film released by Disney under the Touchstone banner. Universal Pictures then replaced Disney as DreamWorks&#x27; distributor. Disney retained the film rights to these DreamWorks films in perpetuity as compensation for the studio&#x27;s outstanding loan.

Following the release of &quot;The Light Between Oceans&quot;, the label became defunct. Since then, several other Disney divisions have produced or are developing television series and films based on previous Touchstone properties—such as &quot;Turner &amp; Hooch, High Fidelity,&quot; &quot;Three Men and a Baby&quot;, &quot;Sister Act&quot;, and &quot;Real Steel—&quot;for Disney+ and Hulu.

Some well-known Touchstone Pictures releases include &quot;Beaches&quot;, &quot;Turner &amp; Hooch&quot;, &quot;Splash&quot;, &quot;The Color of Money&quot;, &quot;Down and Out in Beverly Hills&quot;, &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot;, &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;, &quot;Sister Act&quot;, &quot;Ed Wood&quot;, &quot;Up Close &amp; Personal&quot;, &quot;The Waterboy&quot;, &quot;The Insider&quot;, &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot;, &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot;, &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, &quot;The Prestige&quot;, &quot;The Help&quot;, &quot;War Horse&quot;, &quot;Lincoln&quot;, and &quot;Bridge of Spies&quot;. Its highest-grossing film release is &quot;Armageddon&quot;. Although animated films produced by Walt Disney Studios are primarily released by Walt Disney Pictures, Touchstone&#x27;s animated releases include the original theatrical release of &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;, &quot;Gnomeo &amp; Juliet&quot;, &quot;The Wind Rises&quot;, and &quot;Strange Magic&quot;. Six Touchstone films have received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Picture: &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot;, &quot;The Insider&quot;, &quot;The Help&quot;, &quot;War Horse&quot;, &quot;Lincoln&quot;, and &quot;Bridge of Spies&quot;.

Through Touchstone, Disney&#x27;s first R-rated film, &quot;Down and Out in Beverly Hills&quot;, was released on January 31, 1986, and was a box office success. &quot;Ruthless People&quot; followed on June 27, 1986, and was also very successful. Both of these pictures starred Bette Midler, who had signed a six-picture deal with Disney and became a major film star again with these hits as well as &quot;Beaches&quot; and &quot;Outrageous Fortune&quot;.

One of the most notable producers of Touchstone films was Jerry Bruckheimer, who had a production deal with Disney from 1993 to 2014. Touchstone films produced by Bruckheimer include &quot;The Ref&quot;, &quot;Con Air&quot;, &quot;Armageddon&quot;, &quot;Enemy of the State&quot;, &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot;, &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot;, and &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;. Bruckheimer also produced several other films released under the Disney and Hollywood Pictures labels.

Releases from Touchstone were distributed theatrically by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures and through home media platforms by Buena Vista Home Entertainment (branded as &quot;Touchstone Home Entertainment&quot;).

=== Touchstone Television ===

Touchstone Television served as Touchstone Pictures&#x27; counterpart label for television programming, producing television series including &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, &quot;Blossom&quot;, &quot;Home Improvement&quot;, &quot;Ellen&quot;, &quot;My Wife and Kids&quot;, &quot;Scrubs&quot;, &quot;Monk&quot;, &quot;Lost&quot;, &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, and &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;. In 2007, the company was renamed ABC Studios as part of a move by Disney to re-align its studios around core brands such as ABC.

On August 10, 2020, Disney announced that it would revive the Touchstone Television brand as a renaming of Fox 21 Television Studios as part of its phase-out of the &quot;Fox&quot; brand from the studios it acquired from 21st Century Fox. At the same time, the existing ABC Studios merged with the previous iteration of ABC Signature Studios to form ABC Signature.

However, on December 1, 2020, Disney announced the revived Touchstone Television label would be folded into 20th Television. Subsequently, on October 1, 2024, Disney announced that ABC Signature would also be folded into 20th Television.

=== Touchstone Interactive ===
By the end of 2007, Disney&#x27;s video game subsidiary Buena Vista Games had begun to produce material under its own short-lived Touchstone imprint. As is the case with its motion picture and television counterparts, Touchstone Interactive merely acted as a brand label of Disney Interactive and not its own entity. The only title it released was the &quot;Turok&quot; video game in 2008.

=== Touchmark Comics ===
In the early 1990s, after having pulled their comic licenses from Gladstone Publishing and begun to create comics based on Disney properties themselves through the Disney Comics label, the company additionally considered an expansion into the burgeoning adult comics market (the expansion also included Hollywood Comics, modeled after Hollywood Pictures, and Vista Comics, offering stories based on Disney&#x27;s superhero and adventure films). Former DC Comics editor Art Young led the nascent effort, which was aided by his contacts within the British and American comic markets. The new label was dubbed Touchmark Comics, echoing the Touchstone brand used for films and television. Proposed titles included &quot;Enigma&quot; by Peter Milligan and &quot;Sebastian O&quot; by Grant Morrison. The brand got as far as a promotional booklet given out at the 1991 San Diego Comic-Con.

Before the idea could progress further, however, the so-called &quot;Disney Implosion&quot; (the result of poor sales and aggressive overexpansion) forced the company to cut back on its comic book ambitions, and Touchmark was scrapped. Young subsequently returned to DC and helped launch the Vertigo imprint in 1993, using many of the intended projects from Touchmark. Now as Marvel Comics.

<text>Anders Graneheim (born May 3, 1962) is a Swedish bodybuilder. He was Swedish and Nordic Bodybuilding Champion during the 1980s. After a nine-year absence from competitive bodybuilding he competed in the &quot;Sweden Grand Prix&quot; in Gothenburg in 1997, where he placed third after two professional bodybuilders.

He won the Swedish competition &quot;B&amp;K Classic Body Show&quot; in 2000 which earned him a pro card in bodybuilding. He also competed in &quot;Master&#x27;s Mr. Olympia&quot; in USA in August 2002.

Anders Graneheim is a popular guest poser at bodybuilding contests and sports events, and he holds seminars about training and nutrition in gyms, sports centers and schools, and he is engaged as a nutrition expert for Swedish athletes and sports teams. He also writes articles for the Swedish bodybuilding monthly &quot;BODY Magazine&quot; (formerly &quot;B&amp;K Sports Magazine&quot;), in which he also has a regular expert column.

With a career spanning over more than 20 years, Anders Graneheim is regarded as one of Sweden&#x27;s most outstanding bodybuilders. He is regarded as Sweden&#x27;s best bodybuilder ever when it comes to symmetry, and he is one of the few bodybuilders in Sweden that is also known to the general public.

Anders Graneheim has been portrayed in a one-hour TV documentary named &quot;Sista Posen&quot; (&quot;The Last Pose&quot;) on Swedish Television, in which a camera team followed his training and preparation for the Master&#x27;s Mr. Olympia competition in the summer of 2002.

<text>Carpino (Pugliese: ) is a coastal town and &quot;comune&quot; of the Italian region of Apulia, lying on the Gargano peninsula.

The town&#x27;s name has been linked to the rebirth of the traditional folk songs of Gargano, which have artistic value and deserve to be preserved and studied. The group &quot;Cantori di Carpino&quot; (Carpino Singers), by reinterpreting ancient tarantellas, has enabled the development of a broadly articulated project regarding the traditional popular music of southern Italy.

The town&#x27;s main square, now called the &quot;Piazza del Popolo&quot;, or People&#x27;s Square, is the historic home of the folk music festival and its influences. The Carpino Folk Festival is an event that includes several cultural elements, brought together under a single symbol, with the performing arts, and especially music, dance, and theater with popular roots, but also workshops, conferences, roundtables, workshops, presentations of literature and cinema, with a full program of live performances, original and energetic, showing the richness and musical diversity of an area that has many natural resources, as well as landscape and historical importance. The festival has high artistic achievements and standards, although it has not yet fully exploited its material in a structured, integrated and accessible way, to represent real strategic factors in economic and social development.

Standing on a hill which has many well tended olive trees, Carpino has been dubbed &quot;Città dell’olio&quot; (Oil Town) because of its business of producing olive oil. Noteworthy are the archaeological site of the &quot;grotte di Minutille&quot; (the Minutille caves), the Church of the Holy Cross, the Church of Saint George, and the Church of Saint Cyril.

==History==
The town is first mentioned in historical records in 1158, in a bull of pope Adrian IV, with which the abbey of Monte Sacro obtained privileges on the church of St. Peter e St. Mary near the &quot;castellum capralis&quot;, a location identifiable as the municipality, as subsequently confirmed from historical documents.

<text>Tongan (English pronunciation: ; &quot;&quot;) is an Austronesian language of the Polynesian branch native to the island nation of Tonga. It has around 187,000 speakers. It uses the word order verb–subject–object and uses Latin script.

==Related languages==
Tongan is one of the multiple languages in the Polynesian branch of the Austronesian languages, along with Hawaiian, Māori, Samoan and Tahitian, for example. Together with Niuean, it forms the Tongic subgroup of Polynesian.

Tongan is unusual among Polynesian languages in that it has a so-called &quot;definitive accent&quot;. As with all Polynesian languages, Tongan has adapted the phonological system of proto-Polynesian.

# Tongan has retained the original proto-Polynesian *h, but has merged it with the original *s as . (The found in modern Tongan derives from *t before high front vowels). Most Polynesian languages have lost the original proto-Polynesian glottal stop ; however, it has been retained in Tongan and a few other languages including Rapa Nui.
# In proto-Polynesian, *r and *l were distinct phonemes, but in most Polynesian languages they have merged, represented orthographically as in most East Polynesian languages, and as in most West Polynesian languages. However, the distinction can be reconstructed because Tongan kept the *l but lost the *r.

Tongan has heavily influenced the Wallisian language after Tongans colonized the island of ʻUvea in the 15th and 16th centuries.
==Writing==
===History===
The earliest attempts to transcribe the Tongan language were made by Willem Schouten and Jacob Le Maire of the Dutch East India Company when they first arrived in 1616. They transcribed a limited number of nouns and verbs using phonetic Dutch spelling and added them to a growing list of Polynesian vocabulary. Abel Tasman, also of the Dutch East India Company, attempted to converse with indigenous Tongans using vocabulary from this list when he arrived on Tongatapu on 20 January 1643, although he was poorly understood, likely using words added from different Polynesian languages.

=== Alphabet ===
Tongan is presently written in a subset of the Latin script. In the old, &quot;missionary&quot; alphabet, the order of the letters was modified: the vowels were put first and then followed by the consonants: a, e, i, o, u, with variation of letter ā. That was still so as of the Privy Council decision of 1943 on the orthography of the Tongan language. However, C. M. Churchward&#x27;s grammar and dictionary favoured the standard European alphabetical order, which, since his time, has been in use exclusively:
Notes:
# written as &quot;g&quot; but still pronounced as (as in Samoan) before 1943
# unaspirated; written as &quot;b&quot; before 1943
# sometimes written as &quot;j&quot; before 1943 (see below)
# the glottal stop. It should be written with the modifier letter turned comma (Unicode 0x02BB) and not with the single quote open or with a mixture of quotes open and quotes close. See also okina.

The above order is strictly followed in proper dictionaries. Therefore, &quot;ngatu&quot; follows &quot;nusi&quot;, &quot;a&quot; follows &quot;vunga&quot; and it also follows &quot;z&quot; if foreign words occur. Words with long vowels come directly after those with short vowels. Improper wordlists may or may not follow these rules. (For example, the Tonga telephone directory for years now ignores all rules.)

The original &quot;j&quot;, used for , disappeared in the beginning of the 20th century, merging with . By 1943, &quot;j&quot; was no longer used. Consequently, many words written with &quot;s&quot; in Tongan are cognate to those with &quot;t&quot; in other Polynesian languages. For example, &quot;Masisi&quot; (a star name) in Tongan is cognate with &quot;Matiti&quot; in Tokelauan; &quot;siale&quot; (Gardenia taitensis) in Tongan and &quot;tiare&quot; in Tahitian. This seems to be a natural development, as in many Polynesian languages derived from Proto-Polynesian .

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
/l/ may also be heard as an alveolar flap sound .

=== Vowels ===
===Syllabification===
*Each syllable has exactly one vowel. The number of syllables in a word is exactly equal to the number of vowels it has.
*Long vowels, indicated with a &quot;toloi&quot; (macron), count as one, but may in some circumstances be split up in two short ones, in which case, they are both written. Toloi are supposed to be written where needed, in practice this may be seldom done.
*Each syllable may have no more than one consonant.
*Consonant combinations are not permitted. The &quot;ng&quot; is not a consonant combination, since it represents a single sound. As such it can never be split, the proper hyphenation of (Tongan) therefore is fa-ka-to-nga.
*Each syllable must end in a vowel. All vowels are pronounced, but an &quot;i&quot; at the end of an utterance is usually unvoiced.
*The &quot;fakaua&quot; is a consonant. It must be followed (and, except at the beginning of a word, preceded) by a vowel. Unlike the glottal stops in many other Polynesian languages texts, the fakaua is always written. (Only sometimes before 1943.)
*Stress normally falls on the next-to-last syllable of a word with two or more syllables; example: (sleep), (bed). If, however, the last vowel is long, it takes the stress; example: (mouse) (stress on the long ā). The stress also shifts to the last vowel if the next word is an enclitic; example: (house), (this house). Finally the stress can shift to the last syllable, including an enclitic, in case of the definitive accent; example: ((that) particular bed), (this particular house). It is also here that a long vowel can be split into two short ones; example: pō (night), poó ni (this night), pō ní (this particular night). Or the opposite: (light), (this light), (this particular light). There are some exceptions to the above general rules. The stress accent is normally not written, except where it is to indicate the definitive accent or &quot;fakamamafa&quot;. But here, too, people often neglect to write it, only using it when the proper stress cannot be easily derived from the context.

Although the acute accent has been available on most personal computers from their early days onwards, when Tongan newspapers started to use computers around 1990 to produce their papers, they were unable to find, or failed to enter, the proper keystrokes, and it grew into a habit to put the accent after the vowel instead of on it: not &#x27; but &#x27;. But as this distance seemed to be too big, a demand arose for Tongan fonts where the acute accent was shifted to the right, a position halfway in between the two extremes above. Most papers still follow this practice.

==Grammar==

===Articles===
English uses only two articles:
*indefinite &quot;a&quot;
*definite &quot;the&quot;

By contrast, Tongan has three articles, and possessives also have a three-level definiteness distinction:
* indefinite, nonspecific: &quot;ha&quot;. Example: &quot;ko ha fale&quot; (&#x27;a house&#x27;, &#x27;any house&#x27; - the speaker has no specific house in mind, any house will satisfy this description, e.g. &#x27;I want to buy &quot;a house&quot;&#x27;)
* indefinite, specific: &quot;(h)e&quot;. Example: &quot;ko e fale&quot; (&#x27;a (particular) house&#x27; - the speaker has a specific house in mind, but the listener is not expected to know which house, e.g. &#x27;I bought &quot;a house&quot;&#x27;)
* definite, specific: &quot;(h)e&quot; with the shifted ultimate stress. Example: &quot;ko e falé&quot; (&#x27;the house&#x27;, - the speaker has a specific house in mind and the listener is expected to know which one from context, e.g. &#x27;I bought &quot;the house&quot; I told you about&#x27;).

===Registers===
There are three registers which consist of
* ordinary words (the normal language)
* honorific words (the language for the chiefs)
* regal words (the language for the king)
There are also further distinctions between 
* polite words (used for more formal contexts)
* derogatory words (used for informal contexts, or to indicate humility)
For example, the phrase &quot;Come and eat!&quot; translates to:
* ordinary: &quot;hau o kai&quot; (come and eat!); Friends, family members and so forth may say this to each other when invited for dinner.
* honorific: &quot;mea mai pea ilo&quot; (come and eat!); The proper used towards chiefs, particularly the nobles, but it may also be used by an employee towards his boss, or in other similar situations. When talking about chiefs, however, it is always used, even if they are not actually present, but in other situations only on formal occasions. A complication to the beginning student of Tongan is that such words very often also have an alternative meaning in the ordinary register: &quot;mea&quot; (thing) and &quot;ilo&quot; (know, find).
* regal: &quot;hāele mai pea taumafa&quot; (come and eat!); Used towards the king or God. The same considerations as for the honorific register apply. &quot;Hāele&quot; is one of the regal words which have become the normal word in other Polynesian languages.

===Pronouns===
The Tongan language distinguishes three numbers: singular, dual, and plural. They appear as the three major columns in the tables below.

The Tongan language distinguishes four persons: First person exclusive, first person inclusive, second person and third person. They appear as the four major rows in the tables below. This gives us 12 main groups.

====Subjective and objective====

In addition, possessive pronouns are either alienable (reddish) or inalienable (greenish), which Churchward termed &quot;subjective&quot; and &quot;objective&quot;. This marks a distinction that has been referred to, in some analyses of other Polynesian languages, as &quot;a-possession&quot; versus &quot;o-possession&quot;, respectively, though more Tongan-appropriate version would be &quot;e-possession&quot; and &quot;ho-possession&quot;.

&quot;Subjective&quot; and &quot;objective&quot; are fitting labels when dealing with verbs: &quot;eku taki&quot; &quot;my leading&quot; vs. &quot;hoku taki&quot; &quot;my being led&quot;. However, this is less apt when used on nouns. Indeed, in most contexts &quot;hoku taki&quot; would be interpreted as &quot;my leader&quot;, as a noun rather than a verb. What then of nouns that have no real verb interpretation, such as &quot;fale&quot; &quot;house&quot;?

Churchward himself laid out the distinction thus:

But what about those innumerable cases in which the possessive can hardly be said to correspond either to the subject or to the object of a verb? What, for example, is the rule or the guiding principle, which lies behind the fact that a Tongan says &quot;eku paanga&quot; for &#x27; my money&#x27; but &quot;hoku fale&quot; for &#x27;my house&#x27;?

It may be stated as follows: the use of &quot;eku&quot; for &#x27;my&#x27; implies that I am active, influential, or formative, &amp;c., towards the thing mentioned, whereas the use of &quot;hoku&quot; for &#x27;my&#x27; implies that the thing mentioned is active, influential, or formative, &amp;c., towards me. Or, provided that we give a sufficiently wide meaning to the word &#x27;impress&#x27;, we may say, perhaps, that &quot;eku&quot; is used in reference to things upon which I impress myself, while &quot;hoku&quot; is used in reference to things which impress themselves upon me.

E possessives are generally used for:

*Goods, money, tools, utensils, instruments, weapons, vehicles, and other possessions which the subject owns or uses (&quot;eku paanga&quot;, &quot;my money&quot;)
*Animals or birds which the subjects owns or uses (&quot;eku fanga puaka&quot;, &quot;my pigs&quot;)
*Things which the subject eats, drinks, or smokes (&quot;eku meakai&quot;, &quot;my food&quot;)
*Things which the subject originates, makes, mends, carries, or otherwise deals with (&quot;eku kavenga&quot;, &quot;my burden&quot;)
*Persons in the subject&#x27;s employ, under their control, or in their care (&quot;eku tamaioeiki&quot; &quot;my male servant&quot;)

Ho possessives are generally used for

*Things which are a part of the subject or &#x27;unalienable&#x27; from the subject, such as body parts (&quot;hoku sino&quot;, &quot;my body&quot;)
*Persons or things which represent the subject (&quot;hoku hingoa&quot;, &quot;my name&quot;)
*The subject&#x27;s relatives, friends, associates, or enemies (&quot;hoku hoa&quot;, &quot;my companion (spouse)&quot;)
*Things which are provided for the subject or devolve to them or fall to their lot (&quot;hoku tofia&quot;, &quot;my inheritance&quot;)
*In general, persons or things which surround, support, or control the subject, or on which the subject depends (&quot;hoku kolo&quot;, &quot;my village/town&quot;)

There are plenty of exceptions which do not fall under the guidelines above, for instance, &quot;eku tamai&quot;, &quot;my father&quot;. The number of exceptions is large enough to make the alienable and inalienable distinction appear on the surface to be as arbitrary as the grammatical gender distinction for Romance languages, but by and large the above guidelines hold true.

=====Cardinal pronouns=====
The cardinal pronouns are the main personal pronouns which in Tongan can either be preposed (before the verb, light colour) or postposed (after the verb, dark colour). The first are the normal alienable possessive pronouns, the latter the stressed alienable pronouns, which are sometimes used as reflexive pronouns, or with &quot;kia te&quot; in front the inalienable possessive forms. (There is no possession involved in the cardinal pronouns and therefore no alienable or inalienable forms).
*all the preposed pronouns of one syllable only (ku, u, ma, te, ta, ke, mo, ne, na) are enclitics which never can take the stress, but put it on the vowel in front of them. Example: &quot;ʻoku naú&quot; versus &quot;ʻokú na&quot; (not: &quot;ʻoku ná&quot;).
*first person singular, &quot;I&quot; uses &quot;u&quot; after &quot;kuo&quot;, &quot;te&quot;, &quot;ne&quot;, and also &quot;ka&quot; (becomes &quot;kau&quot;), &quot;pea&quot;, &quot;mo&quot; and &quot;ʻo&quot;; but uses &quot;ou&quot; after &quot;ʻoku&quot;; and uses &quot;ku&quot; after &quot;naʻa&quot;.
*first person inclusive (I and you) is somewhat of a misnomer, at least in the singular. The meanings of &quot;te&quot; and &quot;kita&quot; can often rendered as &quot;one&quot;, that is the modesty &quot;I&quot;.
Examples of use.
*Naʻa &quot;ku&quot; fehuʻi: I asked
*Naʻe fehuʻi (ʻe) &quot;au&quot;: I(!) asked (stressed)
*ʻOku &quot;ou&quot; fehuʻi &quot;au&quot;: I ask myself
*Te &quot;u&quot; fehuʻi kiate &quot;koe&quot;: I shall ask you
*Te &quot;ke&quot; tali kiate &quot;au&quot;: You will answer me
*Kapau te &quot;te&quot; fehuʻi: If one would ask
*&quot;Tau&quot; ō ki he hulohula?: Are we (all) going to the ball?
*Sinitalela, &quot;mau&quot; ō ki he hulohula: Cinderella, we go to the ball (... said the evil stepmother, and she went with two of her daughters, but not Cinderella)

Another archaic aspect of Tongan is the retention of preposed pronouns. They are used much less frequently in Samoan and have completely disappeared in East Polynesian languages, where the pronouns are cognate with the Tongan postposed form minus &quot;ki-&quot;. (We love you: ʻOku ʻofa kimautolu kia te kimoutolu; Māori: e aroha nei mātou i a koutou).

=====Possessive pronouns=====
The possessives for every person and number (1st person plural, 3rd person dual, etc.) can be further divided into normal or ordinary (light colour), emotional (medium colour) and emphatic (bright colour) forms. The latter is rarely used, but the two former are common and further subdivided in definite (saturated colour) and indefinite (greyish colour) forms.
Notes:
#the ordinary definite possessives starting with &quot;he&quot; (in italics) drop this prefix after any word except &quot;ʻi, ki, mei, ʻe&quot;. Example: &quot;ko ʻeku tohi&quot;, my book; &quot;ʻi heʻeku tohi&quot;, in my book.
#all ordinary alienable possessive forms contain a fakauʻa, the inalienable forms do not.
#the emphatic forms are not often used, but if they are, they take the definitive accent from the following words (see below)
#first person inclusive (me and you) is somewhat of a misnomer. The meanings of &quot;heʻete, hoto&quot;, etc. can often rendered as &quot;one&#x27;s&quot;, that is the modesty &quot;me&quot;.
#the choice between an alienable or inalienable possessive is determined by the word or phrase it refers to. For example: &quot;ko ho fale&quot; &#x27;(it is) your house&#x27; (inalienable), &quot;ko ho&#x27;o tohi&quot;, &#x27;(it is) your book&#x27; (alienable). *&quot;Ko ho tohi, ko hoʻo fale&quot;* are wrong. Some words can take either, but with a difference in meaning: &quot;ko ʻene taki&quot; &#x27;his/her leadership&#x27;; &quot;ko hono taki&quot; &#x27;his/her leader&#x27;.

Examples of use.
*ko haʻaku/haku kahoa: my garland (any garland from or for me)
*ko ʻeku/hoku kahoa: my garland (it is my garland)
*ko ʻeku/hoku kahoá: my garland, that particular one and no other
*ko heʻete/hoto kahoa: one&#x27;s garland {mine in fact, but that is not important}
*ko siʻaku kahoa: my cherished garland (any cherished garland from or for me)
*ko siʻeku/siʻoku kahoa: my cherished garland (it is my cherished garland)
*ko haʻakú/hoʻokú kahoa: garland (emphatically mine) – that particular garland is mine and not someone else&#x27;s
*ko homa kahoa: our garlands (exclusive: you and I are wearing them, but not the person we are talking to)
*ko hota kahoa: our garlands (inclusive: you and I are wearing them, and I am talking to you)

=====Other pronouns=====
These are the remainders: the pronominal adjectives (mine), indirect object pronouns or pronominal adverbs (for me) and the adverbial possessives (as me).

Notes:
#the first syllable in all singular pronominal adjectives (in italics) is reduplicated and can be dropped for somewhat less emphasis
*the pronominal adjectives put a stronger emphasis on the possessor than the possessive pronouns do
*the use of the adverbial possessives is rare
Examples of use:
*ko hono valá: it is his/her/its clothing/dress
*ko e vala ʻona: it is his/her/its (!) clothing/dress
*ko e vala ʻoʻona: it is his/her/its (!!!) clothing/dress
*ko hono valá ʻona: it is his/her/its own clothing/dress
*ko hono vala ʻoná: it is his/her/its own clothing/dress; same as previous
*ko hono vala ʻoʻoná: it is his/her/its very own clothing/dress
*ʻoku ʻoʻona ʻa e valá ni: this clothing is his/hers/its
*ʻoku moʻona ʻa e valá: the clothing is for him/her/it
*ʻoange ia moʻono valá: give it (to him/her/it) as his/hers/its clothing

===Numerals===
In Tongan, &quot;telephone-style&quot; numerals can be used: reading numbers by simply saying their digits one by one. For &#x27;simple&#x27; two-digit multiples of ten both the &#x27;full-style&#x27; and &#x27;telephone-style&#x27; numbers are in equally common use, while for other two-digit numbers the &#x27;telephone-style&#x27; numbers are almost exclusively in use:


ʻOku fiha ia? (how much (does it cost)?) Paʻanga ʻe ua-nima-noa (T$2.50)

In addition there are special, traditional counting systems for fish, coconuts, yams, etc. (Cf. Classifier (linguistics).)

==Literature==
Tongan has a very rich oral literature and is primarily a spoken, rather than written, language.

One of the first publications of Tongan texts was in William Mariner&#x27;s grammar and dictionary of the Tongan language, edited and published in 1817 by John Martin as part of volume 2 of Mariner&#x27;s &quot;Account of the Natives of the Tonga Islands, in the South Pacific Ocean&quot;. Orthography has changed since Mariner&#x27;s time.

An annotated list of dictionaries and vocabularies of the Tongan language is available at the website of the Bibliographical Society of America under the resource heading &#x27;Breon Mitchell&quot;: .

The Bible and the Book of Mormon were translated into Tongan and few other books were written in it.

There are several weekly and monthly magazines in Tongan, but there are no daily newspapers.

Weekly newspapers, some of them twice per week:
*&quot;Ko e Kalonikali ʻo Tonga&quot;
*&quot;Ko e Keleʻa&quot;
*&quot;Taimi ʻo Tonga&quot;
*&quot;Talaki&quot;
*&quot;Ko e Tauʻatāina&quot;
*&quot;Tonga Maʻa Tonga&quot;

Monthly or two-monthly papers, mostly church publications:
*&quot;Taumuʻa lelei&quot; (Catholic Church)
*&quot;Tohi fanongonongo&quot; (Free Wesleyan)
*&quot;Liahona&quot; (The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints)
*&quot;ʻOfa ki Tonga&quot; (Tokaikolo)

==Calendar==
The Tongan calendar was based on the phases of the moon and had 13 months. The main purpose of the calendar, for Tongans, was to determine the time for the planting and cultivation of yams (&quot;ufi&quot;), which were Tonga&#x27;s most important staple food.

<text>Street furniture is a collective term for objects and pieces of equipment installed along streets and roads for various purposes. It includes benches, traffic barriers, bollards, post boxes, phone boxes, streetlamps, traffic lights, traffic signs, bus stops, tram stops, taxi stands, public lavatories, fountains, watering troughs, memorials, public sculptures, and waste receptacles.

== Description and use ==
Street furniture is a collective term used in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. It refers to objects and pieces of equipment installed along streets and roads for various purposes. The design and placement of furniture should take into account aesthetics, visual identity, function, pedestrian mobility and road safety. For example, street furniture can be positioned to control overspill parking in addition to its primary purpose; for example a bench and a number of bollards may be used to block access to a sidewalk or verges for vehicles.

Street furniture is used unofficially as sports equipment for skateboarding, parkour and street workout.

== Items ==
* Street name signs identify streets for the unfamiliar, especially benefiting visitors, postal workers and the emergency services. They may also indicate the district in which a street lies.
* Benches are usually found in central parts of settlements, such as plazas and parks. They are often provided by the local councils or contributors to serve as a place to rest and admire views. Armrests in between are sometimes provided to discourage lying down and/or unwanted closeness, which can be seen or intended as hostile architecture.
* Bollards are posts, short poles, or pillars placed to prevent vehicle movement into areas where they are not desired, and to protect buildings and other site features.
* Litter bins or garbage cans, are strategically placed to try to entice people into not littering on the streets.
* Post boxes, also known as mail boxes, are found throughout the world, and have a variety of forms.
* Phone boxes or telephone booths or phone booths are prominent in most cities. While they range drastically in the amount of cover they offer users (e.g. many only cover the phone itself while others provide full booths) they are typically easy to spot. The widespread use of mobile phones has resulted in a decrease in their numbers.
* Streetlamps or street lights&#x27; are designed to illuminate the surrounding area at night, serving not only as a deterrent to criminals but more importantly to allow people to see where they&#x27;re going. The colour of streetlamp bulbs differ, but are generally white or yellow.
* Traffic lights (or traffic signals) usually include three colours: green indicates vehicles should proceed through an intersection; amber indicates vehicles should prepare to stop; and red indicates vehicles should not enter the intersection. They are generally mounted on poles or gantries or hung from wires.
* Traffic signs communicate road conditions to inform safe driver behaviours. Postings may specify aspects such as speed limits, intersection protocols, slippery road conditions or reduced visibility. Direction signs tell the reader the way to a location through diagrams or written instructions. Signs may be illuminated to aid nighttime users.
* Public lavatories offer restroom facilities, either for free or for a fee.
* Fire hydrants.
* Parking meters.
* Poster poles or advertising columns provide space for advertising.
* Waste containers or litter bins are receptacles for public garbage disposal. Collection and separation of recyclable materials is becoming more common in urban centers.
* Emergency telephone boxes allow members of the public to directly contact emergency service operators.
* Street curbstones.
* Paving stones, brick rosettes or granite cobbles, sometimes even wood.
* Anti sit-lie dispositives prevent people (i.e. homeless) from sitting or lying down.
* Defunct village pump spouts and village lock-ups, both common in the United Kingdom
* Outdoor vending machines, such as newspaper vending machines
* Planter boxes and other apparatuses for plant life and landscaping

=== Outdoor advertising ===
* Posters are a part of out-of-home media (also referred to as OOH). The presentation of backlit posters is done in display boxes or street furniture components like mega-displays or billboards. To install these street furniture components on public ground, city councils have to approve them. To get these permissions (Europe, Asia and part of the US) services and fees are offered to the cities by the outdoor advertisers.
* In Europe there is a heavy competition to advertise in public spaces. This is due to the high potential for exposure and influence.
* Public advertising amenities must fit the broader architecture and urban planning rules of their cities. These requirements lead to interesting design approaches for poster presentation in different formats.
* Street furniture families were designed to fit these needs. Over the years they were completed with additional components like restrooms and automatic toilet facilities and kiosks to name a few.
* To finance this infrastructure long-term contracts (10 to 15 years) are signed between cities and outdoor advertising companies.
* Cities are often put in a situation to decide on new concepts when they are not familiar with the issues, since new contracts occur only very seldom. This knowledge gap is closed by a special advisor—the street furniture report.
* This advisor gives cities some independent ideas on how to act in this surrounding (rather than reacting) since public grounds can not be enlarged.

==Local significance==
Street furniture itself has become as much a part of many nations&#x27; identities as dialects and national events, so much so that one can usually recognise the location by their design; famous examples of this include:
* The red telephone boxes and pillar boxes of Britain
* The residential mail boxes of the United States
* The street lights and metro entrances of Paris.

==Historical street furniture==
Since most items of street furniture are of a utilitarian nature, authorities generally keep them up-to-date and replace them regularly (usually to conform to regulations, safety codes, etc.). Because of this, old, outdated, obsolete, or even non-functional street furniture can be rare sights and hold a special fascination and inspire nostalgia for many people.

The Tiergarten park in Berlin has a collection of antique streetlamps from around the world, both gas and electric.

==Telecommunication==

Some concealed cell sites disguise the tower with a structure that can fit into street furniture.

Large displays in central streets can provide information, advertise events or products, or warn citizens about potential problems. Interactive displays can show information on key places and monuments and allow parking payments. They can serve as a cell site with low visual impact.

Some cell sites have a structure that make it look pleasant. In this case it is not concealed but highlighted, becoming a part of the street furniture that can be admired by citizens.

The use of power from renewable sources may be a design criterion.

<text>Tsonga ( ) or, natively, Xitsonga, as an endonym, is a Bantu language spoken by the Tsonga people of South Africa. It is mutually intelligible with Tswa and Ronga and the name &quot;Tsonga&quot; is often used as a cover term for all three, also sometimes referred to as Tswa-Ronga. The Xitsonga language has been standardised for both academic and home use. Tsonga is an official language of the Republic of South Africa, and under the name &quot;Shangani&quot; it is recognised as an official language in the Constitution of Zimbabwe. All Tswa-Ronga languages are recognised in Mozambique. It is not official in Eswatini (formerly Swaziland).

== History ==
The Xi-tsonga language was studied in great detail by the Swiss missionary, Henri-Alexandre Junod between the years 1890 and 1920, concluded that the Xitsonga language (which he called the &quot;Thonga language&quot; at the time) began to develop in Mozambique even before the 1400s. In his own words, Junod states the following:

Further studies were carried out by Junod and other Swiss missionaries such as Henri Berthoud and Ernest Creux, who began to unify the language to have a standard way of writing and reading. &quot;Shigwamba&quot; was a term used by the missionaries to group the language under a unified identity, however the name was unfamiliar to many of the Tsonga people and had to be replaced with &quot;Thonga/Tsonga&quot;. Harries refers to this:

Swiss missionaries worked with the Tsonga people, assisting in the translation of the Bible from English and Sesotho into Tsonga. Paul Berthoud published the first book in 1883, thanks to assistance from translations by Mpapele (Mbizana) and Mandlati (Zambia). The two men were active in teaching and translating the language to the missionaries since none of the missionaries were familiar with it and had to dedicate much of their time to learn it. The language of the Tsonga people and the dialects were put into print and the first books were published. The language was later on finally registered as &quot;Xitsonga&quot; within the Constitution of South Africa (Act 108 of 1996) and it was declared an official language. The standardization of the Xitsonga language as a result made it possible for the Tsonga people to develop a common way of speaking and writing.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Tsonga&quot; is the root of Xitsonga (culture, language or ways of the Tsonga) Mutsonga (a Tsonga person), Vatsonga (Tsonga people), etc. In the language of the Vatsonga themselves, the root never appears by itself. It is Tsonga for the ease and accessibility of the wider international community.

As for the origins of the name, there are three theories. The first states that Tsonga is another pronunciation for Dzonga, which means &quot;South&quot; and also the name of one of the dialects of Xitsonga. The second theory is that it is an alternative spelling of the old ancestral name of the Chopi and Tembe groups, Tonga/Thonga. The other Zulu explanation for the alternative spelling of &quot;Thonga&quot; is that the Tembe and Rhonga people, who were the first to arrive at the Delagoa Bay and around the Natal Bay, transitioned the Rhonga &quot;Rh&quot; into the Zulu form of &quot;Th&quot;. An example is &quot;rhuma&quot; (Tsonga word for &quot;send&quot;) becoming &quot;thuma&quot; (Zulu word for the same action). The third and most accepted is that it is another pronunciation for &quot;Rhonga&quot;, the root for the word &quot;vurhonga&quot; for east or the direction where the sun rises. Vurhonga also means dawn in Xitsonga. Rhonga (commonly and wrongly spelt as Ronga) is one of the Tsonga languages. The physical evidence of most Tsonga people residing along the eastern coast of Africa in the south, extending inland in a westward direction, makes this explanation especially inviting. However Junod had initially used the Ronga appellation but had also realized that the northern clans did not frequently use the name &#x27;Ronga&#x27; as their identity name, but most certainly Tsonga is a derivation of Ronga.

Much of the written history about the Tsonga regards the aftermath of the mfecane where the Nguni people overran many of the pre-existing African tribes of South Africa, Eswatini, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe.

== Languages and dialects ==

Tsonga is a Bantu language (Guthrie code S.53), closely related to other members to the Tswa-Ronga group (S.50):
# Ronga (Rhonga) dialects are Kalanga (Xinyisa, Xindindindi (Xizingili), Putru, and Xinyondroma.
# Tsonga (Gwamba, Gwapa) dialects are Bila (Vila), Djonga (Dzonga, Jonga), Hlanganu (Langanu, Nhlanganu), Hlave (Mbayi, Nkuna, Pai), Kande, Khosa, Luleke, N&#x27;walungu (Ngwalungu), Nkuma, Songa, Valoyi, Xika, and Xonga.
# Tswa (Tshwa) dialects are Dzibi (Dzivi), Dzibi-Dzonga (Dzivi-Dzonga), Tshwa, Hlengwe (Lengwe, Lhenge), Khambani, Makwakwe-Khambani, Mandla, Ndxhonge, and Nhayi (Nyai, Nyayi).

Some dialects are subdialects but have been mentioned here for completeness. For example, Valoyi and Luleke comprise the N&#x27;walungu dialect. There is no Gwamba dialect as Gwamba is another name for Xitsonga itself. Formally Xitsonga has been called Gwamba. Tswa-Ronga dialects not considered part of the family include Pulana (Xipulana, Sepulane). What is commonly referred to as &quot;Shangana/Changana&quot; is not a recognized language in South Africa and is not a dialect that falls within the Xitsonga language group, as its distinctiveness stems mainly from the use of the Nguni language and grammar.

Only six Thonga/Tsonga dialects exist and these were identified by the dawn of the 1900s. These are namely xiRonga, xiHlanganu, xiBila, xiDjonga, xiN&#x27;walungu, and xiHlengwe. All other variations within South Africa are sub-dialects of the aforementioned. The dialects most spoken in the rural communities of Limpopo are the N&#x27;walungu, Bila, Hlengwe, and the Hlanganu dialects. The Xitsonga vocabulary and phonetic permutations are also largely based on these dialects (cf. Junod 1912, p. 470–473)

For &quot;language of&quot;, the various languages and dialects employ one or more of the following prefixes: Bi-, Chi-, Ci-, Gi-, Ici-, Ki-, Ma-, Shee-, Shi-, Txi-, Va-, Wa-, and Xi-. For &quot;people of&quot;, they use either &quot;Ba-&quot; or &quot;Va-&quot;.

==Orthography==
==Phonology==
Tsonga has a distinction between modal and breathy voiced consonants: vs among the obstruents (the one exception being ), and vs among the sonorants (the one exception being ). The segmental inventory is as follows:

===Vowels===

Long vowels are written double. Nasalized vowels are not distinguished in writing; are only found in words for &#x27;yes&#x27; and &#x27;no&#x27;, while is found in a few mimetic words. Mid vowels can vary from close-mid to open-mid; they are generally close-mid before a high vowel, or , and low-mid otherwise. Vowels may be realized as murmured when following breathy consonants.

===Consonants===

Many of these consonants may be preceded by a nasal, but they are not prenasalized consonants: at least in word-initial position, they are nasal–obstruent sequences where the nasals are syllabic.

Different consonant sounds may alternate the place of articulation. A number of Tsonga speakers vary the affricates from alveolar to retroflex ; the latter are weakly whistled in Tsonga proper and in Changana dialect. Labiodental and dental appear in homorganic consonant clusters.

Unlike some of the Nguni languages, Tsonga has very few words with click consonants, and these vary in place between dental and postalveolar . Examples are: 
 (mind), (wear/dress), (kneel), (phone), (earring), (compose), (Saturday).

==Grammar==
The grammar is generally typical of Bantu languages with a subject–verb–object order. The structure changes to subject—object—verb when addressing another person:
=== Verbs ===

Almost all infinitives have the prefix &quot;ku&quot;- and end with -&quot;a&quot;.

The main exception to this is the verb – &quot;to say&quot; It corresponds to &quot;ti&quot; in many other Bantu languages. Examples of its usage include:
 – What do you say? (What are you saying?)
 – I say to you all.

In many instances the is often omitted and thus on its own can also mean &quot;say&quot;.
 – They say I&#x27;m crazy.
 – What do they say? (What are they saying?)

Present tense
The present tense is formed by simply using the personal pronoun along with the verb.
 – I want money,
 – We work all day,
 – Who are you looking for?
 – S/He knows how to walk.

Present progressive
Generally, to indicate ongoing actions in the present one takes the personal pronoun, drops the and adds .
 – I am entering the house,
 – We are working right now,
 – You (plural) are lying,
 – You (singular) are lying,
 – S/He is lying,
With the plural (they) there is no difference. Thus = &quot;they lie&quot; and &quot;they are lying&quot;.

Past tense
This is for in one of three ways, depending on the word.
(i) Generally, one drops the from the verb and adds the prefix 
 – I entered the house,
 – We worked all day,
 – You lied,
 – S/He lied,
 – They lied.

(ii) With verbs that end with , the past tense changes to or .
 – to forget,
 – I forgot, – you forgot, – they forgot,
 – To disappear,
 – S/He – disappeared,
Words used to describe a state of being also use the past tense.
 – To be tired,
 – I am tired, – S/He is tired, – They are tired.

(iii) In many cases merely changing the last in the verb to an indicates past action.
 – To arrive,
 – S/He arrived yesterday,
 – I arrived yesterday,
 – We worked all day,
 – I entered the house.

Future tense
This is formed by the adding in between the personal pronoun and the verb.
 – I will enter the house,
 – We will work all day,
 – They will work all day,
 – You (plural) will work all day.

===Noun classes===
Tsonga has several classes, much like other Bantu languages, which are learned through memorisation mostly. These are:

* In classes 9 and 10, is present when the noun stem has one syllable, and is absent otherwise.

===Personal pronouns===
Personal pronouns in Tsonga are very similar to those of many other Bantu languages, with a few variations.

These may be classified as first person (the speaker), second person (the one spoken to), and third person (the one spoken about). They are also classified by grammatical number, i.e., singular and plural. There is no distinction between subject and object.

Each pronoun has a corresponding concord or agreement morpheme.

==Vocabulary==
The vocabulary of Xitsonga is essentially similar not only to most South African languages but also other Eastern Bantu languages, for example, Kiswahili.

=== Numerals ===
===Months of the year===
===Borrowings===
Tsonga, like many other African languages, have been influenced by various European colonial languages. Tsonga vocabulary includes words borrowed from English, Afrikaans, and Portuguese. Also, due to the assimilation of the Shangaan nation, it has taken some words from Nguni languages.

Words borrowed from English:
* – television
* – Radio
* – chair (Stool)
* – watch (to tell time)
* – car (automobile)
* – socks
* – glass
* – clock(bell)
* – municipal (plural: )
* – keys

Words borrowed from Afrikaans:
* – sweets ()
* – window ()
* – spoon ()
* – church ()
* – trousers ()
* – idiot ()
* – table ()
* – ghost ()

Words borrowed from other Nguni languages:
* – phone
* – to head towards (not standard = )
* – to end (not standard = )
* – to try (not standard = )

==Writing system==

===Xitsonga Latin alphabet===
Xitsonga uses the Latin alphabet. However, certain sounds are spelled using a combination of letters, which either do not exist in Indo-European languages, or may be meant to distinguish the language somewhat.

An example of this is the letter &quot;x&quot; taken from Portuguese orthography, which is pronounced . Therefore, the following words, [ʃuʃa], [ʃikolo], [ʃilo], are written in Tsonga as and .

Other spelling differences include the letter &quot;c&quot;, which is pronounced . However, where the emphasis of a word is on the following vowel the letter is hardened by adding &quot;h&quot; this the Tsonga word -chava (fear)

A sound equivalent to the Welsh &quot;ll&quot; () is written &quot;hl&quot; in Tsonga, e.g. -hlangana (meet), -hlasela (attack), -hleka (laugh)

A whistling sound common in the language is written &quot;sw&quot; or &quot;sv&quot; in Zimbabwean ChiShona. This sound actually belongs to the &quot;x-sw&quot; class within the language. E.g.:
* (now)
* (thing) – (things)
* (school) – (schools)
* (God) – (gods)

Another whistling sound is spelled &quot;dy&quot; but has no English equivalent, the closest being the &quot;dr&quot; sound in the English word &quot;drive&quot;

Xitsonga has been standardised as a written language. However, there are many dialects within the language that may not pronounce words as written. For example, the Tsonga bible uses the word (tell), pronounced bwe-la, however a large group of speakers would say &quot;dzvela&quot; instead.

==Oral literature==
===Tales===
E. Dora Earthy, a missionary in Mozambique, published a selection of Tsonga folktales (Lenge dialect) with facing-text English translations in the 1937 volume of the journal &quot;Folklore&quot;: Part 1 contains three stories and Part 2 contains an additional seven stories.

The organisation Aidglobal published a series of four children&#x27;s books in Xichangana (one of Mozambique&#x27;s Tsonga languages) in 2024 written by Venâncio Calisto and Mélio Tinga, and illustrated by Suzy Bila, Marisa Bimbo da Costa, Ruben Zacarias and Samuel Djive. The Xichangana/Portuguese translations were done by Williamo Muchanga.

===Songs===
Henri-Alexandre Junod included a selection of Tsonga song lyrics with English translations in his 1913 study, &quot;The Life of a South African Tribe.&quot;

For more recent studies of Tsonga music and songs, see the publications of Thomas Johnston in the 1970s, all of which include Tsonga song lyrics with English translations.

===Riddles===
Junod also included a selection of Tsonga riddles with English translations in &quot;The Life of a South African Tribe.&quot; Here are two of those riddles:

*&quot;Tiban leshi, nambi mamana wa nwana a ku mu randja ngopfu, loko a tlhasa kaya a nga hluleka ka ku mu yamukela? Hi nyimba.&quot; &quot;Guess what is it that a mother dearly loves but which could not run to meet her on her return home? The unborn babe in the womb.&quot; 
*&quot;Leshi, nambi wa ba, ntonsi wa kone wu nga boneki? I mati.&quot; &quot;The thing which you can beat without leaving a scar? Water.&quot;
Following up on Junod&#x27;s work on Tsonga riddles, J.E. Kaemmer has documented Tsonga &quot;tone riddles,&quot; specifically the &quot;titekatekani&quot; of the Tswa people.

===Proverbs===
Here are some of the Tsonga proverbs which Junod recorded in &quot;The Life of a South African Tribe&quot;:

*&quot;Mumiti wa nhengele a dumba nkolo wa kwe.&quot; &quot;He who swallows a large stone has confidence in the size of his throat (i.e. applying to bumptious and pretentious folk).&quot; (#1)
*&quot;Tinhlange ta le ntjhaku ti tibyiwa hi mutlhabi.&quot; &quot;The tattooing marks made on the back are known by the tattooer (not by the tattooed, i.e. you do not know what may happen when you have turned your back).&quot; (#3)
*&quot;Matimba ya ngwenya i mati.&quot; &quot;The strength of the crocodile is water (i.e. when you are in your own domain you can succeed).&quot; (#4)
Junod later published &quot;Quelques Proverbes Thonga,&quot; a booklet of Tsonga proverbs, in 1931.

<doc id="371461" wikidata="Q160087" url="?curid=371461" title="Acorus">
<text>Acorus is a genus of monocot flowering plants. This genus was once placed within the family Araceae (aroids), but more recent classifications place it in its own family Acoraceae and order Acorales, of which it is the sole genus of the oldest surviving line of monocots. Some older studies indicated that it was placed in a lineage (the order Alismatales), that also includes aroids (Araceae), Tofieldiaceae, and several families of aquatic monocots (e.g., Alismataceae, Posidoniaceae). However, modern phylogenetic studies demonstrate that &quot;Acorus&quot; is sister to all other monocots. Common names include calamus and [[sweet flag]].

The genus is native to North America and northern and eastern Asia, and naturalised in southern Asia and Europe from ancient cultivation. The known wild populations are diploid except for some tetraploids in eastern Asia, while the cultivated plants are sterile triploids, probably of hybrid origin between the diploid and tetraploid forms.

==Characteristics==

The inconspicuous flowers are arranged on a lateral spadix (a thickened, fleshy axis). Unlike aroids, there is no spathe (large bract, enclosing the spadix). The spadix is 4–10 cm long and is enclosed by the foliage. The bract can be ten times longer than the spadix. The leaves are linear with entire margin.

==Taxonomy==

Although the family Acoraceae was originally described in 1820, since then &quot;Acorus&quot; has traditionally been included in Araceae in most classification systems, as in the Cronquist system. The family has recently been resurrected as molecular systematic studies have shown that &quot;Acorus&quot; is not closely related to Araceae or any other monocot family, leading plant systematists to place the genus and family in its own order. This placement currently lacks support from traditional plant morphology studies, and some taxonomists still place it as a subfamily of Araceae, in the order Alismatales. The APG III system recognizes order Acorales, distinct from the Alismatales, and as the sister group to all other monocots. This relationship is confirmed by more recent phylogenetic studies. Treatment in the APG IV system is unchanged from APG III.

=== Species ===
In older literature and on many websites, there is still much confusion, with the name &quot;Acorus calamus&quot; equally but wrongfully applied to &quot;Acorus americanus&quot; (formerly &quot;Acorus calamus&quot; var. &quot;americanus&quot;).

As of July 2014, the Kew Checklist accepts only 2 species, one of which has three accepted varieties:

* &quot;Acorus calamus&quot; – common sweet flag; sterile triploid (3&quot;n&quot; = 36); probably of cultivated origin. It is native to Europe, temperate India and the Himalayas and southern Asia, widely cultivated and naturalised elsewhere.
**&quot;Acorus calamus&quot; var. &quot;angustatus&quot; - Siberia, China, Russian Far East, Japan, Korea, Mongolia, Himalayas, Indian Subcontinent, Indochina, Philippines, Indonesia
**&quot;Acorus calamus&quot; var. &quot;calamus&quot; - Siberia, Russian Far east, Mongolia, Manchuria, Korea, Himalayas; naturalized in Europe, North America, Java and New Guinea
*&quot;Acorus americanus&quot; - Canada, northern United States, Buryatiya region of Russia
* &quot;Acorus gramineus&quot; – Japanese sweet flag or grassy-leaved sweet flag; fertile diploid (2&quot;n&quot; = 18); - China, Himalayas, Japan, Korea, Indochina, Philippines, Primorye

&quot;Acorus&quot; from Europe, China and Japan have been planted in the United States.

=== Etymology ===
The name &#x27;acorus&#x27; is derived from the Greek word &#x27;acoron&#x27;, a name used by Dioscorides, which in turn was derived from &#x27;coreon&#x27;, meaning &#x27;pupil&#x27;, because it was used in herbal medicine as a treatment for inflammation of the eye.

== Distribution and habitat ==
These plants are found in wetlands, particularly marshes, where they spread by means of thick rhizomes. Like many other marsh plants, they depend upon aerenchyma to transport oxygen to the rooting zone. They frequently occur on shorelines and floodplains where water levels fluctuate seasonally.

== Ecology ==
The native North American species appears in many ecological studies. Compared to other species of wetland plants, they have relatively high competitive ability. Although many marsh plants accumulate large banks of buried seeds, seed banks of &quot;Acorus&quot; may not accumulate in some wetlands owing to low seed production. The seeds appear to be adapted to germinate in clearings; after a period of cold storage, the seeds will germinate after seven days of light with fluctuating temperature, and somewhat longer under constant temperature. A comparative study of its life history traits classified it as a &quot;tussock interstitial&quot;, that is, a species that has a dense growth form and tends to occupy gaps in marsh vegetation, not unlike &quot;Iris versicolor&quot;.

== Toxicity ==

Products derived from &quot;Acorus calamus&quot; were banned in 1968 as food additives by the United States Food and Drug Administration. The questionable chemical derived from the plant was β-asarone. Confusion exists whether all strains of &quot;A. calamus&quot; contain this substance.

Four varieties of &quot;A. calamus&quot; strains exist in nature: diploid, triploid, tetraploid and hexaploid. Diploids do not produce the carcinogenic β-asarone. Diploids are known to grow naturally in Eastern Asia (Mongolia and C Siberia) and North America. The triploid cytotype probably originated in the Himalayan region, as a hybrid between the diploid and tetraploid cytotypes. The North American Calamus is known as &quot;Acorus calamus&quot; var. &quot;americanus&quot; or more recently as simply &quot;Acorus americanus&quot;. Like the diploid strains of &quot;A. calamus&quot; in parts of the Himalayas, Mongolia, and C Siberia, the North American diploid strain does not contain the carcinogenic β-asarone. Research has consistently demonstrated that &quot;β-asarone was not detectable in the North American spontaneous diploid &quot;Acorus&quot; [&quot;calamus&quot; var. &quot;americanus&quot;]&quot;.

== Uses ==
The parallel-veined leaves of some species contain ethereal oils that give a sweet scent when dried. Fine-cut leaves used to be strewn across the floor in the Middle Ages, both for the scent, and for presumed efficacy against pests.

<text>The Fraunhofer lines are a set of spectral absorption lines. They are dark absorption lines, seen in the optical spectrum of the Sun, and are formed when atoms in the solar atmosphere absorb light being emitted by the solar photosphere. The lines are named after German physicist Joseph von Fraunhofer, who observed them in 1814.

==Discovery==

In 1802, English chemist William Hyde Wollaston was the first person to note the appearance of a number of dark features in the solar spectrum. In 1814, Joseph von Fraunhofer independently rediscovered the lines and began to systematically study and measure their wavelengths. He mapped over 570 lines, designating the most prominent with the letters A through K and weaker lines with other letters. Modern observations of sunlight can detect many thousands of lines.

About 45 years later, Gustav Kirchhoff and Robert Bunsen noticed that several Fraunhofer lines coincide with characteristic emission lines identified in the spectra of heated chemical elements. They inferred that dark lines in the solar spectrum are caused by absorption by chemical elements in the solar atmosphere. Some of the other observed features were instead identified as telluric lines originating from absorption by oxygen molecules in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

==Sources==
The Fraunhofer lines are typical spectral absorption lines. Absorption lines are narrow regions of decreased intensity in a spectrum, which are the result of photons being absorbed as light passes from the source to the detector. In the Sun, Fraunhofer lines are a result of gas in the Sun&#x27;s atmosphere and outer photosphere. These regions have lower temperatures than gas in the inner photosphere, and absorbs some of the light emitted by it.

==Naming==
The major Fraunhofer lines, and the elements they are associated with, are shown in the following table:
 
The Fraunhofer C, F, G′, and h lines correspond to the alpha, beta, gamma, and delta lines of the Balmer series of emission lines of the hydrogen atom. The Fraunhofer letters are now rarely used for those lines.

The D1 and D2 lines form a pair known as the &quot;sodium doublet&quot;, the centre wavelength of which (589.29 nm) is given the designation letter &quot;D&quot;. This historical designation for this line has stuck and is given to all the transitions between the ground state and the first excited state of the other alkali atoms as well. The D1 and D2 lines correspond to the fine-structure splitting of the excited states.

The Fraunhofer H and K letters are also still used for the calcium doublet in the violet part of the spectrum, important in astronomical spectroscopy.

There is disagreement in the literature for some line designations; for example, the Fraunhofer d line may refer to the cyan iron line at 466.814 nm, or alternatively to the yellow helium line (also labeled D3) at 587.5618 nm. Similarly, there is ambiguity regarding the e line, since it can refer to the spectral lines of both iron (Fe) and mercury (Hg). In order to resolve ambiguities that arise in usage, ambiguous Fraunhofer line designations are preceded by the element with which they are associated (e.g., Mercury e line and Helium d line).

Because of their well-defined wavelengths, Fraunhofer lines are often used to specify standard wavelengths for characterising the refractive index and dispersion properties of optical materials.

<text>In abstract algebra, a semiring is an algebraic structure. Semirings are a generalization of rings, dropping the requirement that each element must have an additive inverse. At the same time, semirings are a generalization of bounded distributive lattices.

The smallest semiring that is not a ring is the two-element Boolean algebra, for instance with logical disjunction formula_1 as addition. A motivating example that is neither a ring nor a lattice is the set of natural numbers formula_2 (including zero) under ordinary addition and multiplication. Semirings are abundant because a suitable multiplication operation arises as the function composition of endomorphisms over any commutative monoid.

== Terminology ==
Some authors define semirings without the requirement for there to be a formula_3 or formula_4. This makes the analogy between ring and on the one hand and and on the other hand work more smoothly. These authors often use rig for the concept defined here. This originated as a joke, suggesting that rigs are ri&quot;n&quot;gs without &quot;n&quot;egative elements. (Akin to using &quot;rng&quot; to mean a r&quot;i&quot;ng without a multiplicative &quot;i&quot;dentity.)

The term dioid (for &quot;double monoid&quot;) has been used to mean semirings or other structures. It was used by Kuntzmann in 1972 to denote a semiring. (It is alternatively sometimes used for naturally ordered semirings but the term was also used for idempotent subgroups by Baccelli et al. in 1992.)

== Definition ==
A semiring is a set formula_5 equipped with two binary operations formula_6 and formula_7 called addition and multiplication, such that:

* formula_8 is a commutative monoid with an identity element called formula_3:
** formula_10
** formula_11
** formula_12
** formula_13
* formula_14 is a monoid with an identity element called formula_4:
** formula_16
** formula_17
** formula_18
Further, the following axioms tie to both operations:
* Through multiplication, any element is left- and right-annihilated by the additive identity:
** formula_19
** formula_20
* Multiplication left- and right-distributes over addition:
** formula_21
** formula_22

=== Notation ===
The symbol formula_23 is usually omitted from the notation; that is, formula_24 is just written formula_25

Similarly, an order of operations is conventional, in which formula_23 is applied before formula_6. That is, formula_28 denotes formula_29.

For the purpose of disambiguation, one may write formula_30 or formula_31 to emphasize which structure the units at hand belong to.

If formula_32 is an element of a semiring and formula_33, then formula_34-times repeated multiplication of formula_35 with itself is denoted formula_36, and one similarly writes formula_37 for the formula_34-times repeated addition.

== Construction of new semirings ==
The zero ring with underlying set formula_39 is a semiring called the trivial semiring. This triviality can be characterized via formula_40 and so when speaking of nontrivial semirings, formula_41 is often silently assumed as if it were an additional axiom.
Now given any semiring, there are several ways to define new ones.

As noted, the natural numbers formula_42 with its arithmetic structure form a semiring. Taking the zero and the image of the successor operation in a semiring formula_5, i.e., the set formula_44 together with the inherited operations, is always a sub-semiring of formula_5.

If formula_46 is a commutative monoid, function composition provides the multiplication to form a semiring: The set formula_47 of endomorphisms formula_48 forms a semiring where addition is defined from pointwise addition in formula_49. The zero morphism and the identity are the respective neutral elements. If formula_50 with formula_5 a semiring, we obtain a semiring that can be associated with the square formula_52 matrices formula_53 with coefficients in formula_5, the matrix semiring using ordinary addition and multiplication rules of matrices. Given formula_33 and formula_5 a semiring, formula_53 is always a semiring also. It is generally non-commutative even if formula_5 was commutative.

Dorroh extensions: If formula_5 is a semiring, then formula_60 with pointwise addition and multiplication given by formula_61 defines another semiring with multiplicative unit formula_62. Very similarly, if formula_63 is any sub-semiring of formula_5, one may also define a semiring on formula_65, just by replacing the repeated addition in the formula by multiplication. Indeed, these constructions even work under looser conditions, as the structure formula_5 is not actually required to have a multiplicative unit.

Zerosumfree semirings are in a sense furthest away from being rings. Given a semiring, one may adjoin a new zero formula_67 to the underlying set and thus obtain such a zerosumfree semiring that also lacks zero divisors. In particular, now formula_68 and the old semiring is actually not a sub-semiring. One may then go on and adjoin new elements &quot;on top&quot; one at a time, while always respecting the zero. These two strategies also work under looser conditions. Sometimes the notations formula_69 resp. formula_70 are used when performing these constructions.

Adjoining a new zero to the trivial semiring, in this way, results in another semiring which may be expressed in terms of the logical connectives of disjunction and conjunction: formula_71. Consequently, this is the smallest semiring that is not a ring. Explicitly, it violates the ring axioms as formula_72 for all formula_73, i.e. formula_4 has no additive inverse. In the self-dual definition, the fault is with formula_75. (This is not to be conflated with the ring formula_76, whose addition functions as xor formula_77.) 
In the von Neumann model of the naturals, formula_78, formula_79 and formula_80. The two-element semiring may be presented in terms of the set theoretic union and intersection as formula_81. Now this structure in fact still constitutes a semiring when formula_82 is replaced by any inhabited set whatsoever.

The ideals on a semiring formula_5, with their standard operations on subset, form a lattice-ordered, simple and zerosumfree semiring. The ideals of formula_53 are in bijection with the ideals of formula_5. The collection of left ideals of formula_5 (and likewise the right ideals) also have much of that algebraic structure, except that then formula_5 does not function as a two-sided multiplicative identity.

If formula_5 is a semiring and formula_89 is an inhabited set, formula_90 denotes the free monoid and the formal polynomials formula_91 over its words form another semiring. For small sets, the generating elements are conventionally used to denote the polynomial semiring. For example, in case of a singleton formula_92 such that formula_93, one writes formula_94. Zerosumfree sub-semirings of formula_5 can be used to determine sub-semirings of formula_91.

Given a set formula_89, not necessarily just a singleton, adjoining a default element to the set underlying a semiring formula_5 one may define the semiring of partial functions from formula_89 to formula_5.

Given a derivation formula_101 on a semiring formula_5, another the operation &quot;formula_103&quot; fulfilling formula_104 can be defined as part of a new multiplication on formula_94, resulting in another semiring.

The above is by no means an exhaustive list of systematic constructions.

=== Derivations ===
Derivations on a semiring formula_5 are the maps formula_107 with formula_108 and formula_109.

For example, if formula_110 is the formula_111 unit matrix and formula_112, then the subset of formula_113 given by the matrices formula_114 with formula_115 is a semiring with derivation formula_116.

== Properties ==
A basic property of semirings is that formula_4 is not a left or right zero divisor, and that formula_4 but also formula_3 squares to itself, i.e. these have formula_120.

Some notable properties are inherited from the monoid structures: The monoid axioms demand unit existence, and so the set underlying a semiring cannot be empty. Also, the 2-ary predicate formula_121 defined as formula_122, here defined for the addition operation, always constitutes the right canonical preorder relation. Reflexivity formula_123 is witnessed by the identity. Further, formula_124 is always valid, and so zero is the least element with respect to this preorder. Considering it for the commutative addition in particular, the distinction of &quot;right&quot; may be disregarded. In the non-negative integers formula_2, for example, this relation is anti-symmetric and strongly connected, and thus in fact a (non-strict) total order.

Below, more conditional properties are discussed.

=== Semifields ===
Any field is also a semifield, which in turn is a semiring in which also multiplicative inverses exist.

=== Rings ===
Any field is also a ring, which in turn is a semiring in which also additive inverses exist. Note that a semiring omits such a requirement, i.e., it requires only a commutative monoid, not a commutative group. The extra requirement for a ring itself already implies the existence of a multiplicative zero. This contrast is also why for the theory of semirings, the multiplicative zero must be specified explicitly.

Here formula_126, the additive inverse of formula_4, squares to formula_4. As additive differences formula_129 always exist in a ring, formula_121 is a trivial binary relation in a ring.

=== Commutative semirings ===
A semiring is called a commutative semiring if also the multiplication is commutative. Its axioms can be stated concisely: It consists of two commutative monoids formula_131 and formula_132 on one set such that formula_133 and formula_134.

The center of a semiring is a sub-semiring and being commutative is equivalent to being its own center.

The commutative semiring of natural numbers is the initial object among its kind, meaning there is a unique structure preserving map of formula_42 into any commutative semiring.

The bounded distributive lattices are partially ordered, commutative semirings fulfilling certain algebraic equations relating to distributivity and idempotence. Thus so are their duals.

=== Ordered semirings ===
Notions or order can be defined using strict, non-strict or second-order formulations. Additional properties such as commutativity simplify the axioms.

Given a strict total order (also sometimes called linear order, or pseudo-order in a constructive formulation), then by definition, the &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; elements fulfill formula_136 resp. formula_137. By irreflexivity of a strict order, if formula_138 is a left zero divisor, then formula_139 is false. The &quot;non-negative&quot; elements are characterized by formula_140, which is then written formula_141.

Generally, the strict total order can be negated to define an associated partial order. The asymmetry of the former manifests as formula_142. In fact in classical mathematics the latter is a (non-strict) total order and such that formula_141 implies formula_144. Likewise, given any (non-strict) total order, its negation is irreflexive and transitive, and those two properties found together are sometimes called strict quasi-order. Classically this defines a strict total order – indeed strict total order and total order can there be defined in terms of one another.

Recall that &quot;formula_145&quot; defined above is trivial in any ring. The existence of rings that admit a non-trivial non-strict order shows that these need not necessarily coincide with &quot;formula_145&quot;.

==== Additively idempotent semirings ====
A semiring in which every element is an additive idempotent, that is, formula_147 for all elements formula_35, is called an (additively) idempotent semiring. Establishing formula_149 suffices. Be aware that sometimes this is just called idempotent semiring, regardless of rules for multiplication.

In such a semiring, formula_150 is equivalent to formula_151 and always constitutes a partial order, here now denoted formula_152. In particular, here formula_153. So additively idempotent semirings are zerosumfree and, indeed, the only additively idempotent semiring that has all additive inverses is the trivial ring and so this property is specific to semiring theory. Addition and multiplication respect the ordering in the sense that formula_154 implies formula_155, and furthermore implies formula_156 as well as formula_157, for all formula_158 and formula_138.

If formula_5 is additively idempotent, then so are the polynomials in formula_161.

A semiring such that there is a lattice structure on its underlying set is lattice-ordered if the sum coincides with the meet, formula_162, and the product lies beneath the join formula_163. The lattice-ordered semiring of ideals on a semiring is not necessarily distributive with respect to the lattice structure.

More strictly than just additive idempotence, a semiring is called simple iff formula_164 for all formula_35. Then also formula_166 and formula_167 for all formula_35. Here formula_4 then functions akin to an additively infinite element. If formula_5 is an additively idempotent semiring, then formula_171 with the inherited operations is its simple sub-semiring. 
An example of an additively idempotent semiring that is not simple is the tropical semiring on formula_172 with the 2-ary maximum function, with respect to the standard order, as addition. Its simple sub-semiring is trivial.

A c-semiring is an idempotent semiring and with addition defined over arbitrary sets.

An additively idempotent semiring with idempotent multiplication, formula_173, is called additively and multiplicatively idempotent semiring, but sometimes also just idempotent semiring. The commutative, simple semirings with that property are exactly the bounded distributive lattices with unique minimal and maximal element (which then are the units). Heyting algebras are such semirings and the Boolean algebras are a special case.

Further, given two bounded distributive lattices, there are constructions resulting in commutative additively-idempotent semirings, which are more complicated than just the direct sum of structures.

==== Number lines ====
In a model of the ring formula_174, one can define a non-trivial positivity predicate formula_136 and a predicate formula_176 as formula_177 that constitutes a strict total order, which fulfills properties such as formula_178, or classically the law of trichotomy. With its standard addition and multiplication, this structure forms the strictly ordered field that is Dedekind-complete. By definition, all first-order properties proven in the theory of the reals are also provable in the decidable theory of the real closed field. For example, here formula_179 is mutually exclusive with formula_180.

But beyond just ordered fields, the four properties listed below are also still valid in many sub-semirings of formula_174, including the rationals, the integers, as well as the non-negative parts of each of these structures. In particular, the non-negative reals, the non-negative rationals and the non-negative integers are such a semirings.
The first two properties are analogous to the property valid in the idempotent semirings: Translation and scaling respect these ordered rings, in the sense that addition and multiplication in this ring validate
* formula_182
* formula_183 for any formula_73. In particular, the &quot;positive&quot; additive difference existence can be expressed as
* formula_185
Secondly, in the presence of a trichotomous order, the non-zero elements of the additive group are partitioned into positive and negative elements, with the inversion operation moving between them. With formula_186, all squares are proven non-negative. Consequently, non-trivial rings have a positive multiplicative unit,
* formula_187
Having discussed a strict order, it follows that formula_41 and formula_189, etc.

==== Discretely ordered semirings ====
There are a few conflicting notions of discreteness in order theory. Given some strict order on a semiring, one such notion is given by formula_4 being positive and covering formula_3, i.e. there being no element formula_35 between the units, formula_193. Now in the present context, an order shall be called discrete if this is fulfilled and, furthermore, all elements of the semiring are non-negative, so that the semiring starts out with the units.

Denote by formula_194 the theory of a commutative, discretely ordered semiring also validating the above four properties relating a strict order with the algebraic structure. All of its models have the model formula_2 as its initial segment and Gödel incompleteness and Tarski undefinability already apply to formula_194. The non-negative elements of a commutative, discretely ordered ring always validate the axioms of formula_194. So a slightly more exotic model of the theory is given by the positive elements in the polynomial ring formula_198, with positivity predicate for formula_199 defined in terms of the last non-zero coefficient, formula_200, and formula_201 as above. While formula_194 proves all formula_203-sentences that are true about formula_2, beyond this complexity one can find simple such statements that are independent of formula_194. For example, while formula_206-sentences true about formula_2 are still true for the other model just defined, inspection of the polynomial formula_208 demonstrates formula_194-independence of the formula_210-claim that all numbers are of the form formula_211 or formula_212 (&quot;odd or even&quot;). Showing that also formula_213 can be discretely ordered demonstrates that the formula_206-claim formula_215 for non-zero formula_35 (&quot;no rational squared equals formula_217&quot;) is independent. Likewise, analysis for formula_218 demonstrates independence of some statements about factorization true in formula_2. There are formula_220 characterizations of primality that formula_194 does not validate for the number formula_217.

In the other direction, from any model of formula_194 one may construct an ordered ring, which then has elements that are negative with respect to the order, that is still discrete the sense that formula_4 covers formula_3. To this end one defines an equivalence class of pairs from the original semiring. Roughly, the ring corresponds to the differences of elements in the old structure, generalizing the way in which the initial ring formula_226 can be defined from formula_2. This, in effect, adds all the inverses and then the preorder is again trivial in that formula_228.

Beyond the size of the two-element algebra, no simple semiring starts out with the units. Being discretely ordered also stands in contrast to, e.g., the standard ordering on the semiring of non-negative rationals formula_229, which is dense between the units. For another example, formula_230 can be ordered, but not discretely so.

==== Natural numbers ====
formula_194 plus mathematical induction gives a theory equivalent to first-order Peano arithmetic formula_220. The theory is also famously not categorical, but formula_2 is of course the intended model. formula_220 proves that there are no zero divisors and it is zerosumfree and so no model of it is a ring.

The standard axiomatization of formula_220 is more concise and the theory of its order is commonly treated in terms of the non-strict &quot;formula_145&quot;. However, just removing the potent induction principle from that axiomatization does not leave a workable algebraic theory. Indeed, even Robinson arithmetic formula_237, which removes induction but adds back the predecessor existence postulate, does not prove the monoid axiom formula_238.

=== Complete semirings ===
A complete semiring is a semiring for which the additive monoid is a complete monoid, meaning that it has an infinitary sum operation formula_239 for any index set formula_240 and that the following (infinitary) distributive laws must hold:
: formula_241
Examples of a complete semiring are the power set of a monoid under union and the matrix semiring over a complete semiring.
For commutative, additively idempotent and simple semirings, this property is related to residuated lattices.

==== Continuous semirings ====
A continuous semiring is similarly defined as one for which the addition monoid is a continuous monoid. That is, partially ordered with the least upper bound property, and for which addition and multiplication respect order and suprema. The semiring formula_242 with usual addition, multiplication and order extended is a continuous semiring.

Any continuous semiring is complete: this may be taken as part of the definition.

=== Star semirings ===
A star semiring (sometimes spelled starsemiring) is a semiring with an additional unary operator formula_243, satisfying
: formula_244
A Kleene algebra is a star semiring with idempotent addition and some additional axioms. They are important in the theory of formal languages and regular expressions.

==== Complete star semirings ====
In a complete star semiring, the star operator behaves more like the usual Kleene star: for a complete semiring we use the infinitary sum operator to give the usual definition of the Kleene star:
: formula_245
where
: formula_246 
Note that star semirings are not related to *-algebra, where the star operation should instead be thought of as complex conjugation.

==== Conway semiring ====

A Conway semiring is a star semiring satisfying the sum-star and product-star equations:
:formula_247

Every complete star semiring is also a Conway semiring, but the converse does not hold. An example of Conway semiring that is not complete is the set of extended non-negative rational numbers formula_248 with the usual addition and multiplication (this is a modification of the example with extended non-negative reals given in this section by eliminating irrational numbers).
An iteration semiring is a Conway semiring satisfying the Conway group axioms, associated by John Conway to groups in star-semirings.

== Examples ==
* By definition, any ring and any semifield is also a semiring.
* The non-negative elements of a commutative, discretely ordered ring form a commutative, discretely (in the sense defined above) ordered semiring. This includes the non-negative integers formula_2.
* Also the non-negative rational numbers as well as the non-negative real numbers form commutative, ordered semirings. The latter is called &quot;&quot;. Neither are rings or distributive lattices. These examples also have multiplicative inverses.
* New semirings can conditionally be constructed from existing ones, as described. The extended natural numbers formula_242 with addition and multiplication extended so that formula_251.
* The set of polynomials with natural number coefficients, denoted formula_252 forms a commutative semiring. In fact, this is the free commutative semiring on a single generator formula_253 Also polynomials with coefficients in other semirings may be defined, as discussed.
* The non-negative terminating fractions formula_254, in a positional number system to a given base formula_255, form a sub-semiring of the rationals. One has formula_256 if formula_257 divides formula_258. For formula_259, the set formula_260 is the ring of all terminating fractions to base formula_261 and is dense in formula_262.
* The &quot;log semiring&quot; on formula_263 with addition given by formula_264 with multiplication formula_265 zero element formula_266 and unit element formula_267

Similarly, in the presence of an appropriate order with bottom element,
* Tropical semirings are variously defined. The semiring formula_268 is a commutative semiring with formula_269 serving as semiring addition (identity formula_270) and ordinary addition (identity 0) serving as semiring multiplication. In an alternative formulation, the tropical semiring is formula_271 and min replaces max as the addition operation. A related version has formula_263 as the underlying set. They are an active area of research, linking algebraic varieties with piecewise linear structures.
* The Łukasiewicz semiring: the closed interval formula_273 with addition of formula_274 and formula_257 given by taking the maximum of the arguments (formula_269) and multiplication of formula_274 and formula_257 given by formula_279 appears in multi-valued logic.
* The Viterbi semiring is also defined over the base set formula_273 and has the maximum as its addition, but its multiplication is the usual multiplication of real numbers. It appears in probabilistic parsing.

* The set of all ideals of a given semiring form a semiring under addition and multiplication of ideals.
* Any bounded, distributive lattice is a commutative, semiring under join and meet. A Boolean algebra is a special case of these. A Boolean ring is also a semiring (indeed, a ring) but it is not idempotent under . A is a semiring isomorphic to a sub-semiring of a Boolean algebra.
* The commutative semiring formed by the two-element Boolean algebra and defined by formula_149. It is also called &quot;the &quot;. Now given two sets formula_208 and formula_283 binary relations between formula_208 and formula_285 correspond to matrices indexed by formula_208 and formula_285 with entries in the Boolean semiring, matrix addition corresponds to union of relations, and matrix multiplication corresponds to composition of relations.
* Any unital quantale is a semiring under join and multiplication.
* A normal skew lattice in a ring formula_5 is a semiring for the operations multiplication and nabla, where the latter operation is defined by formula_289

More using monoids,
* The construction of semirings formula_47 from a commutative monoid formula_49 has been described. As noted, give a semiring formula_5, the formula_52 matrices form another semiring. For example, the matrices with non-negative entries, formula_294 form a matrix semiring.
* Given an alphabet (finite set) Σ, the set of formal languages over formula_295 (subsets of formula_296) is a semiring with product induced by string concatenation formula_297 and addition as the union of languages (that is, ordinary union as sets). The zero of this semiring is the empty set (empty language) and the semiring&#x27;s unit is the language containing only the empty string.
* Generalizing the previous example (by viewing formula_296 as the free monoid over formula_295), take formula_49 to be any monoid; the power set formula_301 of all subsets of formula_49 forms a semiring under set-theoretic union as addition and set-wise multiplication: formula_303
* Similarly, if formula_304 is a monoid, then the set of finite multisets in formula_49 forms a semiring. That is, an element is a function formula_306; given an element of formula_307 the function tells you how many times that element occurs in the multiset it represents. The additive unit is the constant zero function. The multiplicative unit is the function mapping formula_308 to formula_309 and all other elements of formula_49 to formula_267 The sum is given by formula_312 and the product is given by formula_313

Regarding sets and similar abstractions,
* Given a set formula_314 the set of binary relations over formula_315 is a semiring with addition the union (of relations as sets) and multiplication the composition of relations. The semiring&#x27;s zero is the empty relation and its unit is the identity relation. These relations correspond to the matrix semiring (indeed, matrix semialgebra) of square matrices indexed by formula_315 with entries in the Boolean semiring, and then addition and multiplication are the usual matrix operations, while zero and the unit are the usual zero matrix and identity matrix.
* The set of cardinal numbers smaller than any given infinite cardinal form a semiring under cardinal addition and multiplication. The class of of an inner model form a (class) semiring under (inner model) cardinal addition and multiplication.
* The family of (isomorphism equivalence classes of) combinatorial classes (sets of countably many objects with non-negative integer sizes such that there are finitely many objects of each size) with the empty class as the zero object, the class consisting only of the empty set as the unit, disjoint union of classes as addition, and Cartesian product of classes as multiplication.
* Isomorphism classes of objects in any distributive category, under coproduct and product operations, form a semiring known as a Burnside rig. A Burnside rig is a ring if and only if the category is trivial.

=== Star semirings ===
Several structures mentioned above can be equipped with a star operation.
* The aforementioned semiring of binary relations over some base set formula_315 in which formula_318 for all formula_319 This star operation is actually the reflexive and transitive closure of formula_5 (that is, the smallest reflexive and transitive binary relation over formula_315 containing formula_322).
* The semiring of formal languages is also a complete star semiring, with the star operation coinciding with the Kleene star (for sets/languages).
* The set of non-negative extended reals formula_323 together with the usual addition and multiplication of reals is a complete star semiring with the star operation given by formula_324 for formula_325 (that is, the geometric series) and formula_326 for formula_327
* The Boolean semiring with formula_328
* The semiring on formula_329 with extended addition and multiplication, and formula_330 for formula_327

== Applications ==
The formula_332 and formula_333 tropical semirings on the reals are often used in performance evaluation on discrete event systems. The real numbers then are the &quot;costs&quot; or &quot;arrival time&quot;; the &quot;max&quot; operation corresponds to having to wait for all prerequisites of an events (thus taking the maximal time) while the &quot;min&quot; operation corresponds to being able to choose the best, less costly choice; and + corresponds to accumulation along the same path.

The Floyd–Warshall algorithm for shortest paths can thus be reformulated as a computation over a formula_333 algebra. Similarly, the Viterbi algorithm for finding the most probable state sequence corresponding to an observation sequence in a hidden Markov model can also be formulated as a computation over a formula_335 algebra on probabilities. These dynamic programming algorithms rely on the distributive property of their associated semirings to compute quantities over a large (possibly exponential) number of terms more efficiently than enumerating each of them.

== Generalizations ==
A generalization of semirings does not require the existence of a multiplicative identity, so that multiplication is a semigroup rather than a monoid. Such structures are called or . A further generalization are , which additionally do not require right-distributivity (or , which do not require left-distributivity).

Yet a further generalization are : in addition to not requiring a neutral element for product, or right-distributivity (or left-distributivity), they do not require addition to be commutative. Just as cardinal numbers form a (class) semiring, so do ordinal numbers form a near-semiring, when the standard ordinal addition and multiplication are taken into account. However, the class of ordinals can be turned into a semiring by considering the so-called natural (or Hessenberg) operations instead.

In category theory, a is a category with functorial operations analogous to those of a rig. That the cardinal numbers form a rig can be categorified to say that the category of sets (or more generally, any topos) is a 2-rig.

<doc id="371470" wikidata="Q148866" url="?curid=371470" title="Tangelo">
<text>The tangelo ( , ; &quot;C. reticulata × C. maxima&quot; or &quot;× C. paradisi&quot;), &quot;Citrus × tangelo&quot;, is a citrus fruit hybrid of a &quot;Citrus reticulata&quot; variety, such as mandarin orange or tangerine, and a &quot;Citrus maxima&quot; variety, such as a pomelo or grapefruit. The name is a portmanteau of &#x27;tangerine&#x27; and &#x27;pomelo&#x27;.

Tangelos are the size of an adult fist, have a tart and tangy taste, and are juicy (with less flesh inside). They generally have loose skin and are easier to peel than oranges, readily distinguished from them by a characteristic bump at the stem. Tangelos can be used as a substitute for mandarin oranges or sweet oranges.

== Varieties ==
===Orlando===
The early maturing Orlando tangelo is noted for its rich juiciness, mild and sweet flavor, large size, distinct zesty smell, and flat-round shape without a characteristic knob. Orlando tangelos are available from mid-November to the beginning of February. The tangelo originated as a cross between a Duncan grapefruit and a Dancy tangerine. Walter Tennyson Swingle of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is credited with creating the hybrid in 1911. When the Orlando tangelo was first cultivated, it was known by the name Lake tangelo. The trees of this variety grow to a large size and are easily recognized by their cup-shaped leaves. Orlando tangelos are recognized as one of the more cold-tolerant varieties.

=== Minneola ===
The Minneola tangelo (also known as the Honeybell) is a cross between a Duncan grapefruit and a Dancy tangerine and was released in 1931 by the USDA Horticultural Research Station in Orlando. It is named after Minneola, Florida. Most Minneola tangelos are characterized by a stem-end neck, which tends to make the fruit appear bell-shaped. Because of this, it is also called the Honeybell in the gift fruit trade, one of the most popular varieties. Honeybell is sometimes used as unofficial shorthand for premium cultivation. Minneolas are usually fairly large, typically in diameter. The peel color, when mature, is a bright-reddish-orange color. The rind of the Minneola is relatively thin. Minneolas peel rather easily and are very juicy. The Minneola is not strongly self-fruitful, and yields will be greater when interplanted with suitable pollenizers such as Temple tangor, Sunburst tangerine, or possibly Fallglo tangerine. It tends to bear a good crop every other year. In the Northern Hemisphere the fruit matures in the December–February period, with January being the peak.

===Jamaican tangelo===

The Jamaican tangelo, marketed under proprietary names &#x27;ugli fruit&#x27; and &#x27;uniq fruit,&#x27; is a spontaneous hybrid discovered about 1920 on the island of Jamaica, with a rough, wrinkled, greenish-yellow rind. Its exact parentage has not been determined, but it is thought to be a tangerine/grapefruit hybrid.

===K-Early (Sunrise)===
A hybrid propagated by Walter Tennyson Swingle and Herbert John Webber, the K-Early is an early-ripening cultivar that gained a bad reputation at first but has been increasing in popularity in recent years. It is sometimes called &#x27;Sunrise,&#x27; a name also used for a different and older cultivar.

===Mapo===
The Mapo (a portmanteau between &#x27;Mandarino&#x27; and the Italian word for grapefruit, &#x27;Pompelmo&#x27;) is a hybrid developed in 1950 in Italy by the Italian Ministry of Agriculture Citrus Research Station of Acireale. In Italy, the Mapo matures at the end of summer, about two months earlier than most citruses. Its peel is green, smooth, and thin; yellow markings appear when fully ripened. Its pulp is yellow, with orange nuances also when fully ripened. It is a cross between the &#x27;Avana&#x27; mandarin and the Duncan grapefruit.

===Seminole===
The seminole is a hybrid between a &#x27;Bowen&#x27; grapefruit and a &#x27;Dancy&#x27; tangerine. It is deep red-orange in color, oblate in shape with a thin and firm peel, and is not necked. It has 11-13 juicy segments and a pleasant, subacid flavor. It has 20-25 small seeds. The tree is high-yielding and scab-resistant.

===Thornton===
A tangerine-grapefruit hybrid developed by Walter Tennyson Swingle in 1899, the Thornton is oblate to obovate, slightly rough, and medium to large in size. The peel is light orange and is of medium thickness; the pulp inside is pale to deep orange. It has 10-12 juicy segments and a rich subacid to sweet flavor. There are 10-25 slender seeds inside. It ripens from December to March. The tree is high-yielding and is well-adapted to hot and dry regions, although the fruit ships poorly.

===Novel varieties===
In 2011, a troop of baboons was attracted to the higher sweetness of a new likely mutation in a Minneola planting in Cape Town, South Africa, prompting its propagation.

== Drug interactions ==
One study thus far has shown that, unlike grapefruit, interactions with statins are not likely with tangelos. Although the tangelo is derived from a grapefruit crossed with a mandarin, the furocoumarins in grapefruit are not expressed in tangelos.

<doc id="371475" wikidata="Q45626" url="?curid=371475" title="Ruud van Nistelrooy">
<text>Rutgerus Johannes Martinus van Nistelrooij (; born 1 July 1976), commonly known as Ruud van Nistelrooy (), is a Dutch professional football manager and former player who is the current manager of Premier League club Leicester City. Widely regarded as one of the best strikers of his generation, Van Nistelrooy has been the top scorer in three UEFA Champions League seasons, and is the sixth-highest goalscorer in the competition&#x27;s history with 56 goals. He has also been the top scorer in three European domestic leagues. In 2004, he was listed in the FIFA 100 of the world&#x27;s greatest living players.

Van Nistelrooy began his career with Den Bosch, before moving onto Heerenveen, eventually making a name for himself at PSV Eindhoven, where he won two Eredivisie titles. His goalscoring record at PSV attracted attention from Manchester United; a deal was in place in the summer of 2000, but because of injury problems, his move was secured a year later for a then British record fee of £19 million. His time at United was successful, winning the Premier League, FA Cup, Football League Cup, and FA Community Shield, along with winning the Sir Matt Busby Player of the Year twice. Van Nistelrooy scored 150 goals in just 219 games for United, as well as becoming at the time their all-time European record goalscorer, but fell out of favour towards the end of his tenure. Real Madrid then secured his services in 2006. Although an injury blighted the end of his days with Madrid, he won La Liga twice and the Supercopa de España before signing for Hamburger SV during the January transfer window in 2010. After one and a half seasons with Hamburg, he moved back to Spain with Málaga in the summer of 2011. He retired as a player in 2012.

Internationally, Van Nistelrooy represented the Netherlands on 70 occasions, netting 35 times. He was part of the Euro 2004, 2006 World Cup, and Euro 2008 squads.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Born in Oss, North Brabant, Van Nistelrooy started his career in 1993, aged 17, with Dutch Eerste Divisie side Den Bosch, where he was converted from a central midfielder to centre-forward, after playing for local clubs Nooit Gedacht and RKSV Margriet. After netting 12 goals in 31 games in the 1996–97 campaign, he transferred for €360,000 to Heerenveen the next year, and scored 13 goals in 31 matches in his only season with the club. 

=== PSV ===
Van Nistelrooy was signed by PSV Eindhoven ahead of the 1998-99 next season for €6.3 million, a then-record transfer sum between two Dutch teams. Manager Bobby Robson started with him as a substitute, but he went on to score 31 goals in 34 matches, the highest season total in the Eredivisie and second-highest in Europe overall, in addition to scoring all three of PSV&#x27;s goals in a Champions League match against HJK Helsinki on 25 November 1998. Van Nistelrooy capped off the year by winning the Dutch Player of the Year award. The following season, he won his second Eredivisie scoring title with 29 goals. 

Van Nistelrooy looked set to complete a club record £18.5 million transfer to English club Manchester United in the summer of 2000. He was to be unveiled at a press conference four days later, but this was instead used to announce that the transfer had been postponed over concerns about his fitness, having not played for a month due to problems with his knee. The transfer was then cancelled after PSV refused to agree to further medical tests, and the next day he suffered a rupture to his anterior cruciate knee ligaments during a training session, leaving him injured for a year.

===Manchester United===
A year later, Van Nistelrooy signed a five-year contract with Manchester United after passing his medical. He downplayed United&#x27;s £19 million investment to reporters, saying, &quot;The price is not heavy for me – it lifts me up because it means United have big confidence in me.&quot; According to a 2001 interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph,&quot; Manchester United coach Sir Alex Ferguson said that his son, Darren, who was at try-outs for Eredivisie rival Heerenveen at the time, begged his father, &quot;You&#x27;ve got to sign Van Nistelrooy right away, he&#x27;s fantastic. We&#x27;ve been watching him.&quot; Ferguson sent team representatives to PSV&#x27;s next league game and signed Van Nistelrooy the next day.

====2001–02====
Van Nistelrooy made his debut in the Charity Shield against Liverpool, scoring in a 2–1 loss. On 19 August, Van Nistelrooy made his Premier League debut against Fulham at Old Trafford, and scored two goals to help United to a 3–2 win. He scored his first Champions League goals on 17 October in a 3–2 loss to Deportivo La Coruña.

On 22 December, Van Nistelrooy scored his first Premier League hat-trick in a 6–1 win against Southampton. In the FA Cup, Van Nistelrooy started on the bench for the third round tie against Aston Villa due to a groin strain, but was substituted on for Luke Chadwick in the second-half with United 2–0 down and scored two &quot;sublime&quot; goals in three minutes to help United advance to the fourth round with a 3–2 win.

In total during his first season, Van Nistelrooy scored 23 goals in 32 league games. He broke the record he shared with Mark Stein, Alan Shearer and Thierry Henry, by scoring in eight consecutive league games. He also scored ten Champions League goals, and was named the PFA Players&#x27; Player of the Year.

====2002–03====
The following season, he finished as the top Premier League scorer with 25 goals in 34 games, with a goal on the final day against Everton earning him the Golden Boot ahead of Arsenal&#x27;s Thierry Henry. His tally included three hat-tricks against Newcastle United, Fulham, and Charlton Athletic. He also scored in each of the final eight games of the season as United won the title. Van Nistelrooy won the Premier League Player of the Season in 2003. He was accredited with spearheading the title win for United with a goal tally that was described as &quot;astonishing&quot;. After scoring 12 Champions League goals in nine consecutive matches, he was named by UEFA as the best striker in Europe.

====2003–04====
Van Nistelrooy started the 2003–04 season by scoring twice in his first two league matches. This meant he had scored in 10 consecutive league games, then a Premier League record, which stood until 2015 when Jamie Vardy scored in 11 consecutive matches. In the 0–0 draw on 21 September 2003, later dubbed the Battle of Old Trafford, Van Nistelrooy was at the centre of one of the most infamous incidents of the Arsenal–Manchester United rivalry. After missing a last-minute penalty that would have won the game for United, Van Nistelrooy was attacked by Martin Keown, prompting a melee involving several players from both sides; five Arsenal players including Keown received various bans and fines, while the club itself received a record fine of £175,000. Earlier in the game, he had been fouled by Patrick Vieira, who was sent off for a second bookable offence. Vieira and his manager Arsène Wenger both accused Van Nistelrooy of cheating and stamping on Vieira, prompting a vociferous defence by Alex Ferguson.

On 27 September, he scored a hat-trick against Leicester City in a 4–1 victory. He scored his 100th goal for the club in a dramatic 4–3 victory over Everton on 7 February 2004.

In the FA Cup fifth round derby against Manchester City, Van Nistelrooy scored twice to help ten-man United win 4–2, and again scored twice in the quarter-final against Fulham as United came from behind to win 2–1. He scored a further two goals, including one penalty, in United&#x27;s victory over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final.

====2004–05====
Van Nistelrooy missed a large part of the 2004–05 season due to injury, but nonetheless scored a Champions League-best eight goals. One of them was his 30th career European goal, which he scored in a 2–2 Champions League group stage draw with Lyon on 15 September 2004, overtaking Denis Law&#x27;s previous club record of 28 goals. Law later said to reporters, &quot;I&#x27;m delighted for Ruud. It could not happen to a nicer guy.&quot;

On 24 October, Arsenal returned to Old Trafford for another dramatic fixture. Arsenal entered the fixture with 49-game unbeaten run and had been dubbed &quot;The Invincibles&quot;, but United won the game 2–0. Van Nistelrooy scored the opening goal from the penalty spot, atoning for the penalty miss the previous year, with Wayne Rooney scoring a second. Van Nistelrooy was later banned for three games for a foul on Ashley Cole that the referee had missed. On 3 November, Van Nistelrooy scored all four goals in a 4–1 win against Sparta Prague. On 17 April 2005, he scored two goals in the FA Cup semi-final in a 4–1 win against Newcastle, but United lost the final on penalties to Arsenal.

====2005–06====
At the start of the 2005–06 season, Van Nistelrooy scored in United&#x27;s first four Premier League games. He finished as the second-highest league scorer with 21 goals, behind Arsenal&#x27;s Thierry Henry. However, he was benched for the League Cup Final against Wigan Athletic, fuelling speculation of a rift between him and Alex Ferguson, which Van Nistelrooy denied. He was nonetheless left on the bench for six consecutive league matches, and though he then returned to the starting line-up and scored match-winners against West Ham United and Bolton Wanderers, fresh doubt spread over Van Nistelrooy&#x27;s future when he was benched for United&#x27;s season finale win over Charlton Athletic. Ferguson claimed that Van Nistelrooy was angry at the decision and left the stadium three hours before kick-off. On 9 May 2006, it was reported that Van Nistelrooy&#x27;s exclusion from the squad was due to a training session fight between him and teammate Cristiano Ronaldo. Van Nistelrooy allegedly criticised Ronaldo&#x27;s tendency to hold onto the ball instead of passing to his teammates, which sparked the fight, after which Van Nistelrooy remarked, &quot;What are you going to do? Complain to your daddy?&quot; This was in reference to United&#x27;s Portuguese assistant manager, Carlos Queiroz, but Ronaldo took the statement literally and allegedly broke into tears since his father, José had died eight months previously. Van Nistelrooy later apologised to Ferguson for his behaviour in the previous few months.

Van Nistelrooy signed with Spanish La Liga side Real Madrid on 28 July, departing Old Trafford after five seasons with a total of 150 goals in 219 appearances, with his final goal coming on 1 April against Bolton, scoring what proved to be the winning goal. With 38 goals, he is also the club&#x27;s second all-time European goalscorer, behind Wayne Rooney.

===Real Madrid===
On 15 July 2006, Ferguson confirmed that Van Nistelrooy wanted to leave Manchester United and Real Madrid announced two weeks later that he had signed a three-year contract after being purchased for €14 million.

Van Nistelrooy made his debut for the Spanish club in a 1–0 friendly win over Reggina on 4 August 2006. Van Nistelrooy scored a hat-trick in his second league match against Levante and, on 12 November 2006, he scored all four of Real Madrid&#x27;s goals in a 4–1 victory over Osasuna. For the first six months he was a teammate of Ronaldo, a player whom Van Nistelrooy regards as the best he ever played with. Van Nistelrooy won the league&#x27;s Pichichi award with 25 goals as Real Madrid took home the 2006–07 title, and he also equalled the longest consecutive scoring streak in La Liga history with seven straight matches, tying a league record shared by Hugo Sánchez.

In January 2008, Van Nistelrooy signed a contract extension keeping him with Madrid until 2010, with the expiration date one day shy of his 34th birthday. He underwent ankle surgery in March, and returned for the El Clásico derby against Barcelona on 7 May, in which he netted a penalty two minutes after coming on as a substitute. He finished the season with 20 goals in 33 appearances.

In November 2008, Real Madrid announced that Van Nistelrooy would miss the remainder of the 2008–09 season after exploratory arthroscopic surgery revealed a partially torn meniscus in his right knee, with an expected recovery time of six to nine months following a second operation to repair the damage. Van Nistelrooy travelled to the United States to see specialist Richard Steadman, who had previously operated on the same knee back in 2000. At the time of his injury, he had 10 goals in 12 club appearances for the season. Following the injury, he was de-registered by Real Madrid for the rest of the 2008–09 season, and his shirt number was given to Dani Parejo. On 24 August 2009, in the last pre-season match before the start of La Liga, Van Nistelrooy stepped on the pitch for the first time since his injury and played the last 15 minutes of the game against Rosenborg, substituting Kaká. Van Nistelrooy came on for Cristiano Ronaldo in the 80th minute against Xerez in his first La Liga match since recovering from his injury. In the 81st minute, he provided the assist for a Karim Benzema goal, following it with his own 88th-minute goal. During his strike, however, he picked up a thigh injury, where it was later revealed by Real Madrid that he would be out from first team action for up to six weeks. On 27 October, Van Nistelrooy made his second comeback of the season coming on as a substitute for Raúl in the 71st minute against Alcorcón in the Copa del Rey.

===Hamburger SV===
On 23 January 2010, Van Nistelrooy signed an 18-month contract with the German club Hamburger SV until June 2011. He made his first appearance for the club after coming off the bench in the last two minutes of Hamburg&#x27;s 3–3 draw with 1. FC Köln on 6 February. Van Nistelrooy scored his first two goals for Hamburg on 13 February 2010 against VfB Stuttgart in the 75th and 77th minutes of a 3–1 win, after entering the game just a few minutes prior. On 11 March 2010, he scored his first UEFA Europa League goal in the 40th minute of Hamburg&#x27;s match against Anderlecht.

Van Nistelrooy scored his only competitive hat-trick with Hamburg on 15 August 2010, in a 5–1 win over Torgelower SV Greif in the first round of the 2010–11 DFB-Pokal. On 21 August 2010, he scored a brace in Hamburg&#x27;s season opener against Schalke 04, which HSV won 2–1. During that match, he played against his friend and former Real Madrid teammate Raúl, who was making his Bundesliga debut. In the January transfer window, Van Nistelrooy was linked a return move back to Real Madrid and could be used for a short-term basis to cover, following injuries of Gonzalo Higuaín and Karim Benzema as manager José Mourinho would be happy for Van Nistelrooy to join the club as Mourinho left the door for him. Van Nistelrooy admitted he seriously considered moving back to the club if the bid happened. The club, however, rejected Madrid&#x27;s bid for Van Nistelrooy, giving the club a warning as Hamburg wants to keep hold of him until the transfer window ended. Despite being angered over his move to Real Madrid rejected, Van Nistelrooy said he would remain committed at Hamburg. During a match between Hamburg and Hannover 96 on 16 April 2011, Van Nistelrooy suffered a calf injury that kept him out until the last matchday.

Van Nistelrooy netted seven goals and made two assists in 25 appearances in his only full season with Hamburg.

===Málaga===
On 1 June 2011, Van Nistelrooy returned to Spain to pen a one-year deal with La Liga side Málaga, on a free transfer. Van Nistelrooy was presented at La Rosaleda Stadium as he was welcomed by 15,000 Málaga fans. He made his debut in a 2–1 loss against Sevilla on the opening game of the 2011–12 season.

Van Nistelrooy registered his first goal on 1 October 2011 against Getafe. On 21 December, against the same club, he opened the scoring with a volley as Málaga won 3–2 on aggregate in the Copa del Rey. Later on in the season, Van Nistelrooy scored two more goals in the league against Espanyol and Racing Santander, with the latter being his final goal of his career. Just one day before his retirement, Van Nistelrooy made his last appearance of his career, coming on as a substitute in the 75th minute for goalscorer Salomón Rondón, who scored the only goal in Málaga&#x27;s league match against Sporting Gijón.

On 14 May 2012, Van Nistelrooy announced his retirement from football at the age of 35. He told Sport1 he previously made hints that his football career was coming to an end after insisting Málaga would be his last club.

==International career==

Van Nistelrooy earned 70 caps and scored 35 goals for the Netherlands. He made his debut for the national team in a friendly match against Germany on 18 November 1998. However, the cruciate ligament injury which postponed his transfer to Manchester United also ruled Van Nistelrooy out of Euro 2000.

The Dutch failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup, being beaten to a playoff place by the Republic of Ireland. On 19 November 2003, Van Nistelrooy scored a hat-trick in a 6–0 win over Scotland in the UEFA Euro 2004 qualifcation playoffs, ensuring a place in the finals with a 6–1 aggregate win. At the finals in Portugal, he scored in a draw with Germany, a loss to the Czech Republic and twice in a 3–0 win over Latvia, to become the only player other than Czech Milan Baroš to net in all three group games at the tournament.

During a 2006 World Cup qualifying match, he scored in the Dutch&#x27;s 4–0 win over bottom-placed Andorra and was yellow-carded for going to Andorra player Antoni Lima and celebrating in front of him, following an incident six minutes before when Van Nistelrooy missed a penalty and Lima laughed at him. He was a part of coach Marco van Basten&#x27;s squad for the 2006 World Cup finals, for which he served as the official FIFA/SOS ambassador. He started, and was substituted, in all of the Netherlands&#x27; group stage matches, and scored his lone goal against the Ivory Coast. Van Nistelrooy was dropped to the bench by Van Basten without an explanation for the Netherlands&#x27; second round match, which saw them again eliminated by Portugal.

Van Basten left the striker out of the squad for a friendly against the Republic of Ireland on 16 August 2006, and Dirk Kuyt replaced him in their next match against Portugal in September. After Klaas-Jan Huntelaar was unavailable for Euro 2008 qualifiers against Bulgaria and Belarus due to injury, Van Nistelrooy refused Van Basten&#x27;s request to take his place on the team.

On 23 January 2007, Van Nistelrooy announced his retirement from international football following continued disputes with Van Basten, which had started back in 2006 during the course of the World Cup finals matches. After several phone conversations and at the persuasion of veteran goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, however, both player and coach put aside their differences. Van Basten announced four months later that Van Nistelrooy was returning to the &quot;Oranje&quot;. On 8 September, Van Nistelrooy filled Huntelaar&#x27;s spot, as previously requested, for the qualifier against Bulgaria, scoring in a 2–0 victory, and scored the winning goal four days later in injury time of the Netherlands&#x27; win over Albania.

At Euro 2008, Van Nistelrooy scored for the Netherlands in their decisive 3–0 victory over Italy in the group stage, and scored the equaliser in their eventual 3–1 loss to Russia in the quarter-finals. On 4 August, he again announced his retirement from international competition.

During the buildup to the 2010 World Cup, Van Nistelrooy again made himself available, but was left out by the Netherlands&#x27; new coach Bert van Marwijk. After being left out for the World Cup, Van Nistelrooy said he had no choice but to face the fact that his international career is finished.

After main striker Robin van Persie suffered an injury during a match with his club Arsenal, Van Marwijk gave Van Nistelrooy a chance to reclaim his position as the main striker of the Netherlands&#x27; national team. Van Nistelrooy was invited to two Netherlands&#x27; Group E qualification matches for Euro 2012 against San Marino and Finland. He scored in the 5–0 victory against San Marino on 3 September 2010.

Van Nistelrooy was again recalled to the squad in March 2011 for two Euro 2012 qualification games with Hungary, after injuries to strikers Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, Arjen Robben and Theo Janssen. In the away game on 25 March, he appeared as a late substitute for Dirk Kuyt while in the return game in Amsterdam four days later, he came off the bench to score his 35th international goal. adding it is &quot;wonderful to be able to add something to this Oranje team&quot;, as he told Berend Scholten.

==Style of play==
A highly prolific goalscorer, Van Nistelrooy was known for being extremely clinical and opportunistic in front of goal, and stood out throughout his career for his outstanding striking ability and finishing ability with either foot as well as his head, which earned him a reputation as one of the best strikers of his generation. Due to his excellent positional sense, quick reactions and intelligent offensive movement, he excelled at finding space in the penalty area and at anticipating his opponents movement to the ball. He was also known for his ability to time his runs to lose his markers, beat the offside trap, and get on the end of his teammates&#x27; passes; his tendency to be in the right place at the right time in the box saw him occasionally labelled as a &quot;poacher&quot; in the media.

A well-rounded centre-forward, in addition to his eye for goal, Van Nistelrooy was gifted with pace, physical strength, and shooting power, as well as excellent technical skills, and an ability to hold up the ball with his back to goal and link-up with his teammates or provide them with assists, due to his ability to read the game. He was also an accurate penalty taker. In spite of his talent and goalscoring ability, however, at times he drew criticism from managers, players and pundits for his controversial behaviour, as well as for having a tendency to be selfish, overly flamboyant, or for his penchant for simulation.

==Coaching career==
===PSV under-17s===

On 7 November, Van Nistelrooy led his club to their first European win in 13 months in a 2–0 win against PAOK. In what would be his final game in charge, he oversaw a 3–0 league win, again over Leicester City. Upon the arrival of new head coach Ruben Amorim, Van Nistelrooy departed the club.

<text>John Canfield Spencer (January 8, 1788 – May 17, 1855) was an American lawyer, politician, judge and United States Cabinet secretary in the administration of President John Tyler.

After graduating from Union College in 1806, Spencer practiced law and held various positions, including master of chancery, postmaster, and attorney general. Spencer served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1817 to 1819 and the New York State Assembly and Senate in various years between 1820 and 1833. As an anti-Mason, he investigated the disappearance of William Morgan, which sparked the Anti-Masonic movement.

In 1841, President John Tyler appointed Spencer as Secretary of War, and in 1843, he became Secretary of the Treasury. Spencer faced challenges in his role as Treasury Secretary, including a deficit, tariffs, and the development of a plan for a Board of Exchequer. President Tyler nominated Spencer for open Associate Justice seats on the Supreme Court twice in 1844, but both attempts failed. Spencer resigned as Treasury Secretary in May 1844 and returned to Albany.

Spencer married Elizabeth Scott Smith in 1809, and they had several children, many of whom died young or under unfortunate circumstances.

==Early life==
John Canfield Spencer was born on January 8, 1788, in Hudson, New York. He was the oldest child of Ambrose Spencer, Chief Justice of the New York Supreme Court, and his first wife, Laura Canfield (1768–1807). His sister, Abby Spencer (1790–1839), was married to Albany Mayor John Townsend. His younger brother, William Augustus Spencer (1792–1854), was married to Eleanora Eliza Lorillard (1801–1843), the daughter of Peter Abraham Lorillard. His brother, Ambrose Spencer, Jr., was killed at the Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane.

After the death of his mother in 1807, his father married Mary Clinton (1773–1808) in 1808. Mary was the daughter of James Clinton and sister of New York Governor DeWitt Clinton. After Mary&#x27;s death later that same year, his father remarried again to Katherine Clinton (1778–1837), Mary&#x27;s sister.

He graduated from Union College in 1806, became secretary to New York Governor Daniel D. Tompkins in 1807, studied law in Albany, New York, and was admitted to the bar in 1809.

==Career==
After commencing practice in Canandaigua, New York, in 1809, Spencer became a master of chancery in 1811.

During the War of 1812, Spencer served in the United States Army where he was appointed brigade judge advocate general for the northern frontier. He was postmaster of Canandaigua, New York in 1814, became assistant attorney general and district attorney for the five western counties of New York in 1815 and was elected a Democratic-Republican to the United States House of Representatives in 1816, serving from March 4, 1817, to March 3, 1819. He was a member of the committee that reported unfavorably on the affairs of the Second Bank of the United States.

In 1819, he was the Clintonian candidate for U.S. Senator from New York, but due to a three-cornered contest with Bucktail Samuel Young and Federalist Rufus King, no-one was elected. He was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1820 to 1822, and was Speaker in 1820. He was a member of the New York State Senate from 1825 to 1828.

In 1826, Spencer served as a special prosecutor to investigate the disappearance of William Morgan who was arrested, kidnapped and murdered for exposing secrets kept by Freemasons, thus sparking the Anti-Masonic movement. Spencer sided with the anti-Masons and was the author of a manuscript on Masonic rituals. He was again a member of the New York Assembly from 1831 to 1833 and moved to Albany, New York in 1837. He edited the English edition of Alexis de Tocqueville&#x27;s &quot;Democracy in America&quot; and served as Secretary of State of New York from 1839 to 1841.

===Federal government===

In 1841, President John Tyler appointed Spencer to be Secretary of War in his administration. As War Secretary, he proposed a chain of posts extending from Council Bluffs, Iowa to the Columbia River. He also recommended that the government adhere to arrangements made by Army commanders in the field for compensation of the Creek Indians, who had been forced to move west of the Mississippi. In 1842, his nineteen-year-old son, Philip Spencer, a midshipman, was executed without court-martial along with two other sailors aboard the brig USS &quot;Somers&quot; for allegedly attempting mutiny.

In 1843, Spencer was appointed Secretary of the Treasury after the resignation of Walter Forward. As Treasury Secretary, he was preoccupied with the tariff and believed that the deficit and other federal expenditures should be funded by duties on imports rather than by internal taxation, something he was forced to announce for the fiscal year in 1843. The expenditures of the treasury had exceeded its receipts and he advocated additional import duties on articles such as coffee and tea. To help fund the federal deficit he engaged in controversial issues of Treasury Notes. He also continued to develop a plan, originally initiated by Forward, for a Board of Exchequer to keep and disburse public funds raised by duties. The Exchequer bill, which reflected continuing interest in some form of independent treasury system, failed due to a political conflict in the United States Congress.

On two occasions in 1844, President Tyler nominated Spencer to fill open Associate Justice seats on the Supreme Court. The first failed attempt was in January, when Tyler put forward Spencer as a replacement for the recently deceased Smith Thompson. Tyler made the nomination on January 9; on January 31, the Senate rejected Spencer by a 26–21 vote, mainly due to Whig opposition to the president. Tyler then nominated Spencer to fill Henry Baldwin&#x27;s seat in June but withdrew his name for that of Reuben Hyde Walworth. As one of few northerners in an administration dominated by southern interests, Spencer had found it increasingly difficult to serve in his cabinet post and resigned as Treasury Secretary in May 1844. Thereafter, he returned to Albany.

==Personal life==
In 1809, Spencer married Elizabeth Scott Smith (1789–1868). Together, they were the parents of several children, many of whom died in infancy or under unfortunate circumstances:

* Mary Natalie Spencer (1810–1886), who married Henry Morris (1806–1854), son of Capt. Richard Valentine Morris and grandson of Lewis Morris, in 1831.
* Laura Catherine Spencer (1812–1891), who married George W. Clinton (1807–1885), the 12th Mayor of Buffalo who was the son of DeWitt Clinton.
* Eliza Abby Spencer (1815–1816), who died young.
* Ambrose Canfield Spencer (1817–1876), who was murdered in Linn, Missouri, in 1876.
* John Canfield Spencer, Jr. (d. 1845)
* Philip Spencer (1823–1842), who was executed for mutiny in 1842.
* DeWitt Clinton Spencer (1830–1836), who also died young.

In Canandaigua, he lived for 36 years in a house at 210 Main Street, that was built by General Peter Buell Porter (1773–1844), the United States Secretary of War under John Quincy Adams, in about 1800.

He died in Albany, New York, on May 17, 1855. He was interred in Albany Rural Cemetery beside his wife, Elizabeth.

===Descendants===
His grandson, through his daughter Mary, was Henry Lewis Morris (b. 1845), who married Anna Rutherfurd Russell, the daughter of Archibald Russell and Helen Rutherfurd (née Watts) Russell. They were the parents of Lewis Spencer Morris (b. 1884).

His grandchildren, through his daughter Laura, included Elizabeth Spencer Clinton (1835–1918), Spencer Clinton (1839–1914), Catharine Clinton (1841–1881), and George Clinton (1846–1934).

A member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), he was Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Banffshire and Buchan Coast, formerly Banff and Buchan, from 2001 to 2021.

==Early life==
Stevenson was born in Edinburgh. His father James Stevenson was a doctor and his mother Helen MacGregor was a teacher. He was brought up in Cupar, Fife. He was educated at Bell Baxter High School then studied mathematics at the University of Aberdeen. He worked in information technology with the Bank of Scotland for 30 years, retiring in 1999 as Director of Technology Innovation.

==Political career==

===In Opposition===
Stevenson joined the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 1961. He stood as an SNP candidate in the Linlithgow constituency in the 1999 Scottish General election but was unsuccessful.

In January 2001 Stevenson was adopted as the candidate for Banff and Buchan, ahead of the by-election on 7 June 2001 that was triggered by Alex Salmond&#x27;s resignation from the seat to concentrate on Westminster politics. Stevenson was elected with a majority of 8,500 votes over the Conservative candidate.

He made his maiden speech on the European Union&#x27;s Common Fisheries Policy on 14 June 2001.

He was re-elected to the constituency in the 2003 elections.

===University Challenge===
In 2004 he was a member of the Scottish Parliament team in the TV general knowledge programme, &quot;University Challenge – The Professionals&quot;. He and fellow team members Richard Baker (Labour), Robin Harper (Green), Jamie Stone (Lib Dem) who was captain, beat a Welsh Assembly team by 110 points to 75.

===Responsibilities===
In opposition he was Deputy Party Spokesperson on Health until September 2004, then becoming Deputy Party Spokesperson on Justice with responsibility for Prisons and Drugs policy. He was Convenor of the SNP Group in the Scottish Parliament and Deputy Convenor of the Parliament&#x27;s Justice 1 Committee. In addition he ended Session 2 as a substitute member of the Parliament&#x27;s Health Committee and Deputy Convenor of the Parliament&#x27;s Cross Party Group on Visual Impairment.

===Records===
By the end of Parliament&#x27;s second session on 2 April 2007 he had made 284 speeches in the Scottish Parliament and was thus the most prolific speaker since the Parliament&#x27;s being re-convened in 1999. By the end of Session 3 in March 2011, he had made 406 speeches and retained the position of &quot;most prolific parliamentary speaker&quot;. He reached his 500th speech on the Tribunals (Scotland) Bill, on 7 November 2013.

He can, arguably, hold the record for the longest speech in Parliament. He commenced a speech on &quot;International Suicide Prevention Week&quot; at 17:21 on Wednesday, 7 September 2004 and completed it at 17:12 on Thursday, 8 September 2004 nearly 24 hours later. However this was due to the failure of the Parliament&#x27;s sound system just after he started to speak.

On 12 June 2015, he became the first Member of the Scottish Parliament to have made 600 speeches.

===In Government===
In the 2007 Scottish General election on 3 May, he was returned with a majority of 10,530, the largest in Scotland, over the Scottish Conservative Party candidate. The SNP formed a minority government and on 17 May Stevenson was appointed the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change. This appointment covered: the land use planning system, climate change, building standards, transport policy and delivery, public transport, road, rail services, canals, harbours, air and ferry services, Scottish Water.

As Minister, Stevenson piloted the SNP Government&#x27;s first Bill, Abolition of Bridge Tolls (Scotland) Bill., which received royal assent on 24 January 2008, becoming the Abolition of Bridge Tolls (Scotland) Act 2008. At the end of May the Scottish Executive approved The Port of Cairnryan Harbour Empowerment Order 2007 and with this Stevenson became the first SNP Minister to sign a piece of legislation. He also brought forward the SNP&#x27;s first Legislative Consent Motion, previously known as Sewel Motions, on the subject of the UK Climate Change Bill. He was also the first SNP Minister to lose a vote in Parliament on the subject of the Edinburgh Trams project.

As the Minister for Transport, he was involved with the progressing the legislation for the Forth Replacement Crossing, continuing a family association with Firth of Forth infrastructure projects. His great uncle, Sir Alexander Stevenson, was Chairman of the Forth Road Bridge Campaign Committee in the 1930s; the Forth Road Bridge opened in 1964.

In March 2009 Stevenson apologised for the use of an &quot;intemperate word&quot; in Parliament when he said the word &quot;bollocks&quot; in an off-mic remark in response to sedentary remarks by Liberal Democrat MSP Mike Rumbles on the relationship between Scottish ministers and officials at Transport Scotland.

After an unusually heavy snowfall in December 2010 caught authorities by surprise and left thousands of motorists stranded overnight on major highways, Stevenson called the government&#x27;s response &quot;first class&quot; and refused to apologise; anger over the lack of preparedness and over his initial response made his position untenable, and he resigned on 11 December.

===2011 Scottish Parliament election ===
In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, under the re-drawn constituency boundaries, Stevenson was elected as the SNP member for the new seat of Banffshire and Buchan Coast; 16,812 votes cast for him was 67.24% of the total, the highest share of votes cast out of all the constituency elections for the Scottish Parliament in 2011.

Under the Second Salmond government Stevenson returned to a ministerial position, appointed as Minister for Environment and Climate Change on 20 May 2011. His ministerial role ended with the re-shuffle announced on 5 September 2012, when he was replaced as Minister by Paul Wheelhouse MSP.

===2016 Scottish Parliament election===
In the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, Stevenson was re-elected as member for Banffshire and Buchan Coast at the 2016 election with a reduced majority of 6,583. 

===2021 Scottish Parliament election===
Stevenson did not stand for election in 2021, having previously announced his retirement.

Karen Adam was elected as his successor with a majority of 772.

Stevenson was elected National Secretary of the SNP on 30 November 2020 and served for a year.

In October 2022, Stevenson returned to University to study for an MSc in Genealogical, Palaeographic and Heraldic Studies at the University of Strathclyde.

<text>No Idea Records is an American independent record label based in Gainesville, Florida which focuses on punk rock and its sub-styles and produces both vinyl records and compact discs. 

No Idea Records started not as a record label, but as a zine in 1985, published independently by Var Thelin and Ken Coffelt and some friends of theirs from high school. By the seventh issue in 1989, Var was running the zine with Sarah Dyer and other contributors and collaborators. Starting with the sixth edition, the No Idea zine included 7-inch records with each issue. The first featured a local Gainesville band called Doldrums, and the second was a split 7-inch, one side of which belonged to later Bay Area legends Crimpshrine, a major influence on the musical style which dominates No Idea to the present.

Since its beginnings, No Idea has remained a foundation of the Gainesville punk scene and is considered by many to have spawned its very own style of punk, sometimes half-jokingly referred to as &quot;beard punk&quot; or &quot;beardcore&quot; due to the large proportion of members in bands having beards, or more commonly as variations of emo, post-hardcore and pop punk. The label has also worked with grindcore and metalcore bands like Left for Dead, Acrid, Bombs of Death, Crucible and The Swarm aka Knee Deep in the Dead.

<text>Man is a city in western Ivory Coast. It is the seat of both Montagnes District and Tonkpi Region. It is also a commune and the seat of and a sub-prefecture of Man Department. In the 2014 census, the city had a population of 149,041, making it the eighth-largest city in the country.

==History==
In November 2002, during conflict between government and rebel forces, the former rebel group Mouvement patriotique de Côte d&#x27;Ivoire (MPCI) held Man and the towns of Danané, Toulepleu, and Bloléquin.

==Geography==

Man is part of Montagnes District and is an important market town lying between mountains, including Mount Toura and Mount Tonkoui (the two highest in the nation), and La Dent de Man, popular with hikers and most recently, rock climbers.

==Climate==
Man has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen &quot;Aw&quot;).
==Economy==

Man is an agricultural region, with many cocoa, rice, coffee, cassava, banana (plantain), and soybean plantations. The area is the largest producer of coffee in the Ivory Coast. It is the home of a UNICAFÉ (The National Coffee Manufacturer of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire) factory, and Nestlé operates several coffee plants in the area. The central market of Man buys and sells a large variety of fabrics (Yacouba traditional clothes, so-called Boubou Yacouba), and an endless collection of Dan (Yacouba) masks.

The best known hotels are the &quot;Hotel les Casacades&quot;, &quot;Tanhotel&quot;, and &quot;Hotel Beau Sejour&quot;. Those hotels are well-equipped with satellite TV, swimming pools, phone lines, and good service is provided.

==Landmarks==

The city is the home of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Man, with its cathedral at the Cathédrale Saint-Michel.

The main attractions around Man are La Cascade waterfall, a large rocky outcrop which overlooks the town known as the La Dent de Man (the tooth of Man), and the monkey forest. La Cascade waterfall is situated at the west side of the town, and is surrounded by a bamboo forest, which is the habitat of many colorful dragonflies and a wide variety of butterflies. The monkey forest is a wooded area in which monkeys live; for a small fee tourists can persuade local residents to call the monkeys out of their forest habitat.

==Villages==
The twenty nine villages of the sub-prefecture of Man and their population in 2014 are:
