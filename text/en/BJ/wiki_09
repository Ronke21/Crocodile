<text>The Communist Party of Brazil (, PCdoB) is a political party in Brazil. The PCdoB officially adheres to Marxist–Leninist theory. It has national reach and deep penetration in the trade union and student movements.

PCdoB shares the disputed title of &quot;oldest political party in Brazil&quot; with the Brazilian Communist Party (PCB). The predecessor of both parties was the Brazilian Section of the Communist International, founded on 25 March 1922. The current PCdoB was launched on 18 February 1962, in the aftermath of the Sino-Soviet split. Outlawed after the 1964 coup d&#x27;état, PCdoB supported the armed struggle against the regime before its legalization in 1988. Its most famous action in the period was the Araguaia guerrilla (1966–1974). Since 1989, PCdoB has been allied to the Workers&#x27; Party (PT) at the federal level, and, as such, it participated in the Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva administration and joined the &quot;With the strength of the people&quot; coalition, which elected his successor, Dilma Rousseff. In 2018, the party again allied with PT and the candidacy of Fernando Haddad. Haddad&#x27;s running mate was PCdoB member Manuela d&#x27;Ávila. In 2022 it joined the Brazil of Hope coalition with the PT and the Green Party.

PCdoB publishes the newspaper &quot;Working Class&quot; (&quot;Classe Operária&quot;) as well as the magazine &quot;Principles&quot; (&quot;Princípios&quot;), and is a member of the Foro de São Paulo. Its youth wing is the Union of the Socialist Youth (&quot;União da Juventude Socialista&quot;, UJS), launched in 1984, while its trade union wing is the Central of the Workers of Brazil (&quot;Central dos Trabalhadores e Trabalhadoras do Brasil, CTB&quot;), founded in 2007 as a dissidence from the Unified Workers&#x27; Central (&quot;Central Única dos Trabalhadores&quot;, CUT).

==History==

The Communist Party – Brazilian Section of the Communist International (&quot;Partido Comunista – Seção Brasileira da Internacional Comunista, PC-SBIC&quot;) was founded on 25 March 1922, gathering Brazilian Communists under the same label until the international rupture in the movement that occurred after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in 1956, and the 5th Congress of the PC-SBIC in 1960, when Brazilian Communists found themselves divided into two tendencies. At the 20th Congress of the CPSU, Nikita Khrushchev had delivered the so-called &quot;Secret Speech&quot;, which denounced the abuses committed by the Soviet state under Joseph Stalin&#x27;s rule. Khrushchev was considered a revisionist by supporters of the late Stalin, which led to a rupture in the Communist movement in various countries.

In Brazil, the rupture reached the party leadership, which had rebuilt PC-SBIC after the setbacks it suffered under the Estado Novo regime (1930–1945), which tried to pit workers against the party and violently repressed it. The party leadership prior to the rupture, primarily composed of revisionists, was formed in 1943 by João Amazonas, Maurício Grabois, Pedro Pomar, Diógenes Arruda Câmara, and Secretary General Luís Carlos Prestes, among others.

===PC-SBIC (1922–1962)===
The PC-SBIC was ideologically grounded in the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, and in the actions of Vladimir Lenin in the aftermath of the October Revolution, advocating democratic centralism and Marxism–Leninism. It was launched on 25 March 1922 in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, when members of the Brazilian working class took their first big step towards arranging themselves under a class organization; nine delegates, representing 50 workers, held a Congress and founded the PC-SBIC. On 4 April 1922, it was recognized as a political party by the federal government, with its manifesto being published in the Official Gazette. Following the international guidance, the party was given the name of Communist Party – Brazilian Section of the Communist International.

The nine delegates which attended the founding Congress of the PC-SBIC were Abílio de Nequete, a Lebanese Brazilian barber; Astrojildo Pereira, a journalist from Rio de Janeiro; Cristiano Cordeiro, an accountant from Recife; Hermogênio da Silva Fernandes, an electrician from Cruzeiro; João da Costa Pimenta, a linotype operator; Joaquim Barbosa, a tailor from Rio de Janeiro; José Elias da Silva, a shoemaker from Rio de Janeiro; Luís Peres, a broom seller from Rio de Janeiro; and Manuel Cendón, a Spanish-born tailor.

A series of influential parties in the Brazilian political scene emerged from the PC-SBIC, such as the Brazilian Communist Party (PCB) and the Revolutionary Communist Party (PCR), in addition to many Trotskyist and Stalinist groups. The international rupture that arose in the Communist movement after 1956 caused the PC-SBIC to split on 18 February 1962, during its 5th National Congress. At the occasion, the &quot;Manifesto – Program&quot;, which advocated the disassociation of the party with the Communist International, was approved, and the party took the name of Communist Party of Brazil (&quot;Partido Comunista do Brasil&quot;, PCdoB).

===Schisms===

* The Trotskyist Dissence (1928): In mid-1928, PC-SBIC suffered its first schism, when a small group of Marxist intellectuals broke with the political theses of PC-SBIC influenced by Leon Trotsky&#x27;s Left Opposition, and its criticism of Stalinism prevailing as the official ideology of the Communist International and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
* Brazilian Communist Party (1961): In 1961, the &quot;revisionist&quot; group held an Extraordinary National Conference, adopting a new program, a new statute, replacing the main body of the party (&quot;The Working Class&quot;), and adopting the name of Brazilian Communist Party, keeping the acronym of PCB, until then popularly used to identify PC-SBIC. The maneuver was led by Luís Carlos Prestes, which claimed that the move made it possible for PC-SBIC to regain its legal registration – which was ultimately not obtained. The Marxist–Leninist group claimed that Prestes&#x27; move broke PC-SBIC&#x27;s statute and was, therefore, illegal according to the party rules. They launched a document called &quot;The Hundred Men Letter&quot;, claiming the implementation of an extraordinary congress to validate the changes. It also criticized the new party line, accusing it of being &quot;right-wing and opportunistic.&quot; After that, the self called &quot;anti-revisionist&quot; group adopted the name of Communist Party of Brazil and the acronym of PCdoB to differentiate themselves from PCB.
* Communist Revolutionary Party (1968): The Revolutionary Communist Party (&quot;Partido Comunista Revolucionário&quot;, PCR) emerged as an internal split of PCdoB in 1966, four years after the split of PC-SBIC into two parties. It was formed by activists of the student movement and the peasant leagues (a pro-agrarian reform group, considered the predecessor of MST). Its party line was that of Mao Zedong&#x27;s people&#x27;s war, aiming to besiege the cities from the countryside, considering the Northeast Region the best area to trigger the revolution.
* PCdoB&#x27;s Red Wing (1968)
* Revolutionary Communist Party (1979)
* Communist Party of Brazil (formerly Red Fraction) (1990s): The &quot;Partido Comunista do Brasil – Fração Vermelha&quot; originated as an anti-revisionist split of the Communist Party of Brazil in the 1990s. In late 2022 they began appearing as the &quot;Communist Party of Brazil&quot; on documents, removing &quot;Red Fraction&quot; from their name. They are a founding member of the International Communist League (ICL) and currently uphold an ideology they describe as &quot;Marxism-Leninism-Maoism principally Maoism with the Contributions of Universal Validity of Chairman Gonzalo&quot;.

=== Reorganization of the Communist Party of Brazil ===
==== The 1st Reorganization (11 August 1943) ====
The National Party Conference (Conference of Mantiqueira) was held on 11 August 1943, in the era of Estado Novo, with delegates from Rio, São Paulo, Minas Gerais, Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul, Bahia, Sergipe, and Paraíba. This conference would play an enormous role in party life. The Conference reviewed the political situation and the tasks of the Party, politics, and tasks of construction and rebuilding to which it must attend. A new Central Committee was elected, for the old leadership and the party organization was almost torn apart due to arrests by the police. Defeated factions dissolved, and a need to reorganize the party was established, as well as an outlining the tasks of communists in the struggle against fascism, and a declaration of war on the Axis, sending an expeditionary force to fight in Europe. Many Communists marched willingly into the theater of operations in Italy, and the Party organized a broad movement in solidarity with the Brazilian Expeditionary Force (FEB). On 1 August 1950, the Manifesto of August, was released to the public from the Central Committee of Communist Party of Brazil. An attempt to break with the remnants of the &quot;right-wing&quot; and &quot;opportunist&quot; line of the period under review, the Manifesto presented, in essence, a revolutionary line, urging the people to overthrow the regime of landlords and capitalists in the service of American imperialism, and to provide for this a popular army.

==== The 2nd Reorganization (18 February 1962) ====
At the 5th National Conference Meetings, held on 18 February 1962, in São Paulo, with the dissent of Marxist-Leninist tendencies, the party was reorganized. Delegates from Guanabara, São Paulo, Rio, Rio Grande do Sul and Espirito Santo were in attendance. Embracing the acronym and symbol PCdoB, the party was proclaimed the legitimate successor of the Communist Party – Brazilian Section of the Communist International (PC-SBIC). This conference marked a break with Luís Carlos Prestes, who had usurped the party leadership in 1943 and reorganized it along a revisionist line. In opposition to the revisionist line of the 5th Congress, the Conference adopted the Manifesto-Program, which draws a revolutionary line, reintroduced the Statute adopted at the Fourth Congress, adopted a resolution on the unity of the Communists, signed the principle that each country can only exist a single Marxist–Leninist party, decided to reissue The Working Class, a former central organ of the Party, approved the break with the USSR, and, finally, elected a new Central Committee. These historic resolutions mark not only a decisive break with the revisionists, but also purposed the organization of a true Marxist–Leninist vanguard in this conference Brazil. These meetings were attended by Joao Amazonas, Mauricio Grabois, Camara Ferreira, Mário Alves, Jacob Gorender, Miguel Batista de Carvalho, and Apollonius.

=== Maoist guideline (1962–1969) ===

The crisis between the Soviet Union and China reached its peak when the Chinese leader Mao Zedong criticized the ongoing process of de-Stalinization in the USSR, and accused Khrushchev of &quot;opportunistic&quot; and &quot;reformist&quot; deviations. A division of Mao with the rest of the communist movement attracted the sympathy of the PCdoB, who sent emissaries to Beijing to formalize the ideological link with the new ideological guidelines of the Chinese Communist Party. Among these messengers was the party&#x27;s exiled former president, Joao Amazonas, who was received by Mao Zedong. Subsequently, the party gravitated towards Maoism, considering only China and Albania socialist countries, and asserting that others were no longer revolutionary, but revisionist.

However, adherence to Maoism included a shift in the strategies of the PCdoB. Following the principle of protracted people&#x27;s war, PCdoB undertook to transfer ideology to the field, initiating the formation of a peasant army. This conception of revolutionary struggle contrasted with both the traditional tactics of the PCB (which true to the &quot;peaceful path&quot; opposed the armed struggle against the dictatorship) and with Foco new forces such as the MR-8 and the ALN, which prioritized the urban guerrilla and focus as a way of fighting the military government established in 1964.

The final adoption of Maoism by the PCdoB was in 1966 at its 6th Congress. The following year, the party drew up a declaration in support of the Cultural Revolution underway in China. In 1968, PCdoB suffered two internal splits: the Red Wing of PCdoB (favorable to foquista tactics) and the Revolutionary Communist Party (PCR).

=== The Araguaia Guerrilla (1969–1976) ===
Forward from 1966, PCdoB sought to form a nucleus guerrilla camp. The area chosen for the irradiation of the future peasant army (along a Maoist line) was a region south of Para, near the border with Tocantins. It is estimated that the party met 70–80 guerrillas in the area under the military command of former military Osvaldo Orlando da Costa (Osvaldão) and under the command of Mauritius maximum Grabois (then commander in chief of the guerrillas).

The most effective guerrilla of the PCdoB column (under the name &quot;Araguaia Guerrilla Force&quot;) was composed of high school and college students, organized around the Patriotic Union of Youth (UJP, youth wing of the party), professionals, and workers mainly from São Paulo and Minas Gerais. As there was originally little adhesion between locals, the party created the Freedom Union and the People&#x27;s Rights (ULDP), whose manifesto contained the programmatic basis of the guerrillas.

In 1971, Army units discovered the location of the guerrilla nucleus and were deployed to cordon off the area, preventing it from spreading its operations to the north of the Amazon. The repression of guerrilla operations began in 1972, with three military expeditions that mobilized 25,000 soldiers. While the first two were repelled, the third expedition defeated the last pockets of resistance. Most of the guerillas died in clash with Army forces, including Osvaldão Grabois and Maurice, who died in confrontation with the Army on 25 December 1973. In the 3rd campaign of annihilation, the Army used &quot;dirty tactics&quot;, including torture of civilians, and execution and beheading of prisoners, hiding the bodies where they would remain unknown for decades.

The defeat of the Araguaia would establish the ideal of the PCdoB guerrillas as the most effective and experienced of armed struggle the dictatorship. Most of the dead in the repression of the military regime between 1964 and 1979 would be PCdoB militants. The Araguaia Guerrilla redefined the dictatorship&#x27;s plans for the Amazon region, whose repressions in the region were hidden long after the dictatorship&#x27;s fall.

=== The abandonment of Maoism (1976–1979) ===
In the late 1960s, Marxist–Leninist Popular Action (APML), a group derived from the Catholic left, adopted a Maoist ideology and approached the PCdoB. The two groups were merged in 1975, after the end of armed struggle. PCdoB also attracted former members of Pcbr and MR-8.

On 16 December 1976, the DOI-Codi-SP invaded a house on Pius XI Street, São Paulo, killing Pedro Pomar and Ângelo Arroio, torturing João Batista Drumond to death, and taking prisoner Wladimir Pomar (son of Pedro), Aldo Arantes, Haroldo Lima, and Elza Monnerat (the latter two former members of the AP), in an episode that would become known as the Massacre or Slaughter of Lapa. In a climate where the opposition was beginning to gain strength, news coverage of the event resulted in shock and emotion within and outside Brazil. The party leadership, hit hard, began to operate with a core base in exile. Years later, it was discovered that the operation had the help of an informer arrested that year, the head of the PCdoB, Manoel Jover Teles (ex CC member of the PCB and former Pcbr), who was subsequently expelled from the party in 1983.

Shorn of its main cadres, PCdoB began to regroup with staff from the PA leadership and staff of João Amazonas, who, with Diógenes Arruda, were the last remnants of the group that rebuilt the party in 1962. Arruda&#x27;s death (in 1979) left Amazonas as Secretary of the PCdoB until his death.

Observing the failure of the rural guerrilla and the new policy adopted by China since Mao&#x27;s death in 1976, PCdoB decided to break with Maoism. In 1978, the party followed Enver Hoxha in his criticism of Chinese leaders, and considered Albania alone as a socialist country, the last bulwark of Marxism-Leninism.

During this period, an internal split in the PCdoB led to the formation of the Revolutionary Communist Party (PRC), led by José Genoíno and Tarso Genro, which would later join the Workers Party (PT) alongside the &quot;Ala Vermelha&quot; or Red Wing.

=== The path to legalization (1979–1987) ===
The adoption of the new Albanian line did not mean the political radicalization of the PCdoB. In 1978, the party had begun participating in institutional action through the MDB, the moderate opposition to the military government. PCdoB resumed its parliamentary activity and secretly elected its first MPs from within the MDB.

In 1979, with the granting of Amnesty, PCdoB found a favorable environment for their penetration of the unions and student organizations. John Amazonas returned from exile in 1979, and Diogenes Arruda died of a heart attack in the car on the way to a political act. The rebuilding of UNE (1979) with Aldo Rebelo marked the beginning of the hegemony of the party in university entity (continuing ever since, except for the biennium 1987–1988). In 1984, PCdoB founded the Union of Socialist Youth (UJS), its youth wing.

In unionism, PCdoB initially adopted a policy of alliance with trade unionists linked to the PCB, adhering to CONCLAT in 1983, which included moderates and non-Marxists. The party was opposed to the CUT (trade union arm of the PT). In 1984, PCdoB integrated into the Direct Elections Now movement (formed by all opposition parties). The following year, with the defeat of the Dante de Oliveira amendment which would have provided for the direct election of Presidents, the party nominated Tancredo Neves as their candidate in the Electoral College, with the joint support of the PCB and MR8, in application for the democratization and legalization of leftist parties, which would be obtained in 1985. In elections to the Constituent Assembly of 1986, PCdoB elected six deputies, including Haroldo Lima, and Aldo Arantes. Of these, three were originally elected as part of the PMDB, with which they remained an ally, as part of the base of support for the government of Jose Sarney.

=== A socialist program (1987–1995) ===
The social and economic crisis that followed the Cruzado Plan (1987) led PCdoB to break the PMDB. In its place, the party sought a broader alliance with the PT and the PSB. In 1988, trade unionists PCdoB broke with the General Workers Central and formed the current Class Union, which then became part of the CUT, currently connected to the CTB (see Recent Events).

In 1989, along with the PSB, PCdoB supported the candidacy of PT&#x27;s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva for the presidency. The alliance with the PT for the presidential elections was repeated in the elections of 1994, 1998, 2002, and 2006, achieving success in the last two, with the vice president of the ticket, the political and textile businessman José Alencar, from the PL.

Also with the PT, PCdoB also was in opposition to the government of Fernando Collor. PCdoB argued for his removal, which occurred in September 1992 with large student demonstrations, participated in by the UJS along with the UBEs and UNE. At that time, they noted the personal leadership of Lindberg Farias, then president of the UNE and militant member of the PCdoB. Alongside the adoption of a more radical stance internally, PCdoB began to lose its external references. In 1990, a year after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Albanian regime also collapsed, and, with it, Stalinism was in crisis. The main impact of these changes was the decision of PCdoB at its 8th Congress in 1992, with the slogan Vive Socialism, that Stalinism had failed, and to move closer to &quot;classical&quot; Marxism.

That decision opened the party ideologically and allowed the incorporation of new members and alliances. PCdoB resumed ties with Cuba, and, in 1995, at its 8th conference, the party adopted its Socialist Programme. Several Communist intellectuals previously attached to the PCB (as Nelson Werneck Sodré and Edgard Carone) also approached the PCdoB.

During this period, with the fall of the socialist bloc in Eastern Europe, PCdoB regarded itself as in a phase of &quot;strategic defensive&quot;, i.e. a period of the retraction of socialist ideas, motivating the need for an accumulation of forces to advance an offensive stage.

=== Lula administration and opposition to neoliberalism ===
In the late 1980s, PCdoB supported the formation of a popular front to launch Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva&#x27;s candidacy for President. Since then, it has been a member of all electoral coalitions led by the Workers&#x27; Party (PT) at the federal level. It has also allied itself with the PT in most states and capitals.

The PCdoB has registered a generally steady increase in its number of seats in the National Congress since the 1986 elections, the first parliamentary elections which the party contested. It elected 3 deputies in 1986, 5 in 1990, 10 in 1994, 7 in 1998, 12 in 2002, 13 in 2006, and 15 in 2010. In 2000, PCdoB elected its first mayor, Luciana Santos (Olinda). In 2006, it elected its first Senator ever, Inácio Arruda (although the party considers Luís Carlos Prestes, from PC-SBIC, its first Senator.) He was joined by their second Senator, Vanessa Grazziotin, in 2010. Since 2001, the party is led by Renato Rabelo (a former member of the Popular Action guerrilla group), who succeeded João Amazonas who died in the following year.

With the victory of Lula in 2002, PCdoB became part of the federal government, occupying the Ministry of Sports; first with Agnelo Queiroz, and later with Orlando Silva. This was the first time that a Communist occupied a Ministry of the Brazilian state. PCdoB&#x27;s influence over the federal government was expanded in 2004, with the appointment of deputy Aldo Rebelo as political coordinator for the government. The following year, he assumed the presidency of the Chamber of Deputies with the resignation of Severino Cavalcanti. On 16 November 2006, Aldo Rebelo took over the presidency for one day, making him the only Communist President of Brazil. PCdoB also managed to get some participation in the Senate for a brief period of time, when Senator Leomar Quintanilha (formerly a member of PMDB) switched parties.

Although critical of the economic policy of the Lula administration, PCdoB maintained its support to PT. In 2006, when Lula sought his re-election, the party formalized its participation in his alliance. That same year, PCdoB achieved its first municipal administration of a state capital when PT&#x27;s Marcelo Déda resigned in order to run as Governor of Sergipe and Edvaldo Nogueira took office as mayor of Aracaju. At the end of 2007, its divergences with PT began to increase, and PCdoB abandoned the Central Única dos Trabalhadores (CUT) trade union organization, and, along with the Brazilian Socialist Party and other independent sections of the union movement, it founded the Central of Male and Female Workers of Brazil (CTB).

In 2005, the XI Party Congress was held and recast its status, and, among other innovations, admitted for the first time the distinction between &quot;affiliated&quot; and &quot;militant&quot; – this was for subsidiaries to help finance the party and fulfill its obligations. This move is seen as a step toward the massification of the Communist Party of Brazil.

On 21–23 November 2008, PCdoB hosted the 10th International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties, which gathered 65 communist and labour parties from around the world, an event which had never been hosted in Latin America. That same year, it had its largest expansion of local representation, electing 40 mayors; some of them in big cities such as Aracaju, Olinda, Maranguape, and Juazeiro.

In 2009, at the 12th Congress, PCdoB adopted a new Socialist Program, entitled &quot;Strengthening the Nation is the way, socialism is the way!&quot; It covers only the initial phase of transition to socialism, determining the need for collective party action on some issues in the immediate to medium term.

==Structure==
PCdoB was legally recognized as a political party by the Brazilian Electoral Supreme Court on 23 June 1988. Its current President is Luciana Santos. It has nearly 240,000 members.

==Ideology==
PCdoB responded to the collapse of communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the dissolution of the Soviet Union better than most Western communist parties. PCdoB originally established itself as an organization historically linked to the Marxist-Leninist tradition of the Communist International. Its political and ideological identity was consolidated as opposing the so-called 1960s &quot;revisionism&quot;, identified with the directions taken by the USSR after the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. PCdoB then aligned itself with Maoism. After the People&#x27;s Republic of China began making economic reforms in 1979, PCdoB decided to align itself with the Socialist People&#x27;s Republic of Albania, an example of consistency and fidelity to Marxism–Leninism in the opinion of its leaders.

In the 1980s, the Soviet crisis was assessed by PCdoB as the result of the growing integration of the USSR with capitalism and the &quot;social-imperialistic&quot; policies applied by it; the Soviet regime was characterized as a kind of state capitalism. In 1991, as the crisis had reached Albania, PCdoB decided to reassess its theoretical formulations about revisionism, and became nonaligned. At its 8th Congress in 1992, PCdoB innovated itself by criticizing the Bolshevik experience. The party reaffirmed its adherence to Marxism–Leninism and socialism, taking a different path from several other Communist organizations throughout the world.

During this process, PCdoB ranged from an approach that pointed to the class struggle as responsible for the fundamental changes that occurred in the Soviet regime, while on the other hand, it showed an economistic tendency, placing the problems of socialism around the development of productive forces. To some extent, it has shifted from debating these fundamental issues, and, when it did, it treated them marginally.

The party has also been marked by a growing institutionalization inside the political system. This can be perceived in a letter sent to the Communist Party USA on the occasion of its 29th National Convention in 2010. In it, PCdoB demonstrates its concern over the Greek economic collapse and blames neoliberal policies for it. The party lists its electoral goals for the 2010 general elections as being the &quot;consolidation of Communist presence in the institutions&quot;, the &quot;enlargement of influence on lower classes&quot; and &quot;maintaining the democratic and progressive forces at the head of the national government&quot;.

<text>Susan Hampshire, Lady Kulukundis (born 12 May 1937), is an English actress. She is a three-time Emmy Award winner, winning for the television dramas, &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; in 1970, &quot;The First Churchills&quot; in 1971, and for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in 1973. Her film credits include &quot;During One Night&quot; (1961), &quot;The Long Shadow&quot; (1961), &quot;The Three Lives of Thomasina&quot; (1963), &quot;Night Must Fall&quot; (1964), &quot;Wonderful Life&quot; (1964), &quot;The Fighting Prince of Donegal&quot; (1966), &quot;The Trygon Factor&quot; (1966), &quot;The Violent Enemy&quot; (1967), &quot;Malpertuis&quot; (1971), &quot;Living Free&quot; (1972), &quot;Neither the Sea Nor the Sand&quot; (1972) and &quot;Bang!&quot; (1977).

She is also known for her other television roles, such as &quot;The Pallisers&quot; (1974), &quot;The Grand&quot; (1997–98), and as Molly MacDonald in the long running BBC One drama &quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot; (2000–2005).

==Early life==
Susan Hampshire was born in Kensington, London, to George Kenneth Hampshire and his wife June (née Pavey) and is of Irish descent. The youngest of five children, she had three sisters and one brother. Her mother was a teacher and her father was a director of Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), who was rarely at home, her parents having unofficially separated. As a child, she had some developmental difficulties, unable to spell her name until she was nine and unable to read well until she was 12. Her determined mother founded a small London school in 1928, The Hampshire (now Gems Hampshire School), where Susan was taught.

Her childhood ambition was to be a nurse, but she later decided to become an actress. She was diagnosed as dyslexic at the age of 30.

==Career==
As an actress, Hampshire worked in the theatre before moving to film and television work. She took the title role in a dramatised version of &quot;Little Black Sambo&quot; recorded by the His Master&#x27;s Voice Junior Record Club in 1961 (words by David Croft, music by Cyril Ornadel) and sang on &quot;The Midday Show&quot; when ITV Anglia began broadcasting (as Anglia Television) in 1959. Her first starring role was in the film &quot;During One Night&quot; in 1960. She then took the leading role in a 1962 BBC adaptation of &quot;What Katy Did&quot;. Soon afterwards, she was taken up by Walt Disney and starred in &quot;The Three Lives of Thomasina&quot; (opposite Patrick McGoohan) and &quot;The Fighting Prince of Donegal&quot;. She would later appear opposite McGoohan again, in two episodes of &quot;Danger Man&quot;. She co-starred with Cliff Richard in Sidney J. Furie&#x27;s 1964 musical &quot;Wonderful Life&quot;.

In 1966, she was introduced to American TV viewers in the pilot episode of &quot;The Time Tunnel&quot; as a young passenger on the &quot;Titanic&quot; who befriends Dr Tony Newman. She later portrayed conservationist Joy Adamson in &quot;Living Free&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Born Free&quot;. In 1972, she played three different characters in &quot;Malpertuis&quot;, directed by Harry Kumel. She is known for her work on television, appearing in several popular television serials, including &quot;The Andromeda Breakthrough&quot; (1962) in which she replaced Julie Christie who was not available for the show but had played the part of Andromeda in the first season of &quot;A for Andromeda&quot; (1961). Her most notable television role in the 1960s came in the BBC&#x27;s 1967 adaptation of &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot;, in which she played Fleur.

Hampshire received Emmy Awards from the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences for her roles in &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; (1970), &quot;The First Churchills&quot; (1969) and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; (1973). In 1973, she appeared again on US television with Kirk Douglas in a musical version of &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;. Other miniseries in which she appeared are &quot;The Pallisers&quot;, &quot;The Barchester Chronicles&quot; and &quot;Coming Home&quot;. She was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1992 when she was surprised by Michael Aspel at the Ritz Hotel. In 1997, she appeared in the ITV television series &quot;The Grand&quot; where she played a madame residing in the hotel. More recent TV roles include Molly MacDonald, Lady of Glenbogle, in &quot;Monarch of the Glen&quot; (2000–05) and an appearance in &quot;Casualty&quot; (Series 26, No Goodbyes, 19 November 2011) as Caitlin Northwick.

Hampshire has been active on the stage, taking the lead roles in many leading plays. In 2007, she was in the play &quot;The Bargain&quot;, based on a meeting between Robert Maxwell and Mother Teresa. She played the Fairy Godmother in pantomime at the New Wimbledon Theatre in 2005–06 and at the New Victoria Theatre in Woking in 2006–07. In 2008, she joined the relatively small band of actors who have played two generations in the same play on different occasions. Her appearance at the Chichester Festival Theatre in Somerset Maugham&#x27;s &quot;The Circle&quot; as Lady Catherine Champion-Cheney in 2008 followed on from her appearance in the same play (and venue) as Elizabeth Champion-Cheney (Lady Catherine&#x27;s daughter-in-law) in 1976.

==Author and charity work==
Until the publication in 1981 of her autobiography, &quot;Susan&#x27;s Story&quot;, few people were aware of Hampshire&#x27;s struggle with dyslexia. Since then, she has become a prominent campaigner in the UK on dyslexia issues and was president of the Dyslexia Institute from 1995 to 1998.

Her second book, &quot;The Maternal Instinct&quot; (1984), discussed women and fertility issues and she published a collection of interviews, &quot;Every Letter Counts: Winning in Life Despite Dyslexia&quot;, in 1990. She has written children&#x27;s books, including &quot;Lucy Jane at the Ballet&quot;, &quot;Lucy Jane and the Russian Ballet&quot;, &quot;Lucy Jane and the Dancing Competition&quot;, &quot;Lucy Jane on Television&quot;, &quot;Bear&#x27;s Christmas&quot;, &quot;Rosie&#x27;s First Ballet Lesson&quot; and &quot;Rosie&#x27;s Ballet Slippers&quot; as well as various books and videos about her lifelong hobby of gardening, including &quot;Easy Gardening&quot;, &quot;My Secret Garden&quot; and &quot;Trouble Free Gardening&quot;.

She is a patron of the British Homeopathic Association, HIV charity Body Positive Dorset, The National Osteoporosis Society, Dignity in Dying, children&#x27;s education charity Life Education Wessex and Thames Valley and population concern charity Population Matters. She is also patron of Mousetrap Theatre Projects in London which supports theatre productions for the enjoyment of disadvantaged and disabled children. She holds the position of vice-president at Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Ltd, UK. She is also a vice-president of The International Tree Foundation.

==Personal life==
Hampshire was married to her first husband, the French film producer Pierre Granier-Deferre, from 1967 until 1974. The couple have a son, Christopher. Their daughter, Victoria, died within 24 hours of her birth.

She was married to her second husband, Sir Eddie Kulukundis, the theatre impresario, from 1981 until his death in 2021.

Hampshire was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1995 Birthday Honours, for services to dyslexic people. In the 2018 New Year Honours, she was made Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), for services to drama and charity.

<doc id="357599" wikidata="Q1121719" url="?curid=357599" title="Component Pascal">
<text>Component Pascal is a programming language in the tradition of Niklaus Wirth&#x27;s Pascal, Modula-2, Oberon
and Oberon-2.
It bears the name of the language Pascal and preserves its heritage, but is incompatible with Pascal. Instead, it is a minor variant and refinement of Oberon-2 with a more expressive type system and built-in string support. Component Pascal was originally named Oberon/L, and was designed and supported by a small ETH Zürich spin-off company named Oberon microsystems. They developed an integrated development environment (IDE) named BlackBox Component Builder. Since 2014, development and support has been taken over by a small group of volunteers. The first version of the IDE was released in 1994, as &quot;Oberon/F&quot;. At the time, it presented a novel approach to graphical user interface (GUI) construction based on editable forms, where fields and command buttons are linked to exported variables and executable procedures. This approach bears some similarity to the code-behind way used in Microsoft&#x27;s .NET 3.0 to access code in Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML), which was released in 2008.

An open-source software implementation of Component Pascal exists for the .NET and Java virtual machine (JVM) platforms, from the Gardens Point team around John Gough at Queensland University of Technology in Australia.

On 23 June 2004 Oberon microsystems announced that the BlackBox Component Builder was made available as a free download and that an open-source version was planned. The beta open-source version was initially released in December 2004 and updated to a final v1.5 release in December 2005. It includes the complete source code of the IDE, compiler, debugger, source analyser, profiler, and interfacing libraries, and can also be downloaded from their website. Several release candidates for v1.6 appeared in the years 2009–2011, the latest one (1.6rc6) appeared on Oberon microsystems web pages in 2011. At the end of 2013, Oberon microsystems released the final release 1.6. It is probably the last release bundled by them. A small community took over the ongoing development.

BlackBox Component Pascal uses the extensions .odc (Oberondocument) &quot;for document files, such as source files, and .osf &quot;(Oberonsymbolfile&quot;) for symbol files while Gardens Point Component Pascal uses .cp for source and .cps for symbol files. BlackBox Component Pascal has its own executable and loadable object format .ocf (Oberon code file&quot;); it includes a runtime linking loader for this format. The document format (.odc) is a rich text binary format, which allows formatting, supports conditional folding, and allows active content to be embedded in the source text. It also handles user interface elements in editable forms. This is in the tradition of the Oberon Text format.

== Syntax ==

The full syntax for CP, as given by the Language Report, is shown below. In the extended Backus–Naur form, only 34 grammatical productions are needed, one more than for Oberon-2, although it is a more advanced language.

<doc id="357600" wikidata="Q1609779" url="?curid=357600" title="Hereford and Worcester">
<text>Hereford and Worcester ( ) was an English non-metropolitan county created on 1 April 1974 by the Local Government Act 1972 from the areas of the former administrative county of Herefordshire, most of Worcestershire (except Halesowen, Stourbridge and Warley, which became part of the West Midlands) and the county borough of Worcester. An aim of the Act was to increase efficiency of local government: the two counties are among England&#x27;s smaller and less populous counties, particularly after the same Act transferred some of Worcestershire&#x27;s most urbanised areas to the West Midlands.

The county bordered Shropshire, Staffordshire and the West Midlands to the north, Warwickshire to the east, Gloucestershire to the south, and Gwent and Powys in Wales to the west. It was abolished in 1998 and reverted, with some transfers of territory, to the two separate historic counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire.

==Creation==


The Local Government Boundary Commission in 1948 proposed a merger of the two counties, but the proposals of this Commission were not implemented. A merger of Herefordshire with South Worcestershire was again proposed by the Redcliffe-Maud Report in 1969, and was retained in the Conservative Party&#x27;s February 1971 White Paper (gaining more of Worcestershire), although no name was given. In the Local Government Bill introduced into Parliament in November 1971, it was named &quot;Malvernshire&quot;, after the Malvern Hills, which were roughly in the geographical centre of the new county and formed the former border. This name was ridiculed and was altered during the Bill&#x27;s passage through Parliament. The name Wyvern was also suggested, combining the names of the rivers that run through the two cities and counties: the River Wye through Hereford, and the River Severn through Worcester; a wyvern is a dragon emblem often found in heraldry. A commercial radio station for the area, Wyvern FM was set up in 1982 using this allusion. It was also used much later by the FirstGroup who renamed their bus operations in the area First Wyvern as opposed to the more historical First Midland Red used previously.

Herefordshire had about 140,000 people, far fewer than Worcestershire, with about 420,000 and the change was thus perceived in Herefordshire as a takeover rather than a merger, especially after it emerged that the administrative centre was to be located to the east of Worcester city. It never attracted the loyalties of residents. A &quot;Hands off Herefordshire&quot; campaign was set up, and the proposal was opposed by Herefordshire County Council.

A Hereford bull was led down Whitehall on 6 April 1972, as part of a protest, which also involved a petition handed in at 10 Downing Street calling for the preservation of Herefordshire.

Despite the opposition of many of the population of Herefordshire, neither of the county&#x27;s two Conservative MPs opposed the merger. Parliamentary opposition had to be led from outside the county by Terry Davis, MP for Bromsgrove, who noted that the petition had been signed by 60,000 people. Clive Bossom, the MP for Leominster in Herefordshire, supported the merger, noting that &quot;much of South Worcestershire is very like Herefordshire&quot;.

It was originally proposed to have a single large Herefordshire district within Hereford and Worcester. But this was divided, with separate Hereford, South Herefordshire and Leominster districts, and part of Herefordshire in the Malvern Hills district.

Meanwhile, large sections of Worcestershire in the Black Country and Birmingham suburbs were moved to the West Midlands. This was intended to create a more unified metropolitan county, since prior to this the conurbation had been split between Staffordshire, Warwickshire, and Worcestershire. As a result, Hereford &amp; Worcester was quite rural in character. These transfers continued a slow process of simplifying Worcestershire&#x27;s boundaries, which once had included a complex set of exclaves within other counties.

==Districts==
Hereford and Worcester was divided into nine districts:

==Abolition==

As part of the 1990s English local government reform, the Local Government Commission under John Banham recommended that Herefordshire should become a unitary authority, with the rest of the former county retaining a two-tier structure. This came into effect on 1 April 1998. A new unitary Herefordshire was formed from the Herefordshire parts of Malvern Hills and Leominster, along with Hereford and South Herefordshire, and became a unitary authority. The remainder of those two districts became a new Malvern Hills district, in the new two-tier non-metropolitan county of Worcestershire, along with the remaining districts.

Despite its abolition, some remnants of Hereford &amp; Worcester&#x27;s existence remain. For example, there is still a Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue Service. Also, the name is still used by some organisations, such as the BBC local radio station BBC Hereford and Worcester. There is also a Hereford and Worcester Chamber of Commerce.

If Hereford and Worcester still existed, the population of the county would be 797,935 people in 2022.

<text>The Castafiore Emerald () is the twenty-first volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. It was serialised weekly from July 1961 to September 1962 in &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine. In contrast to the previous Tintin books, Hergé deliberately broke the adventure formula he had created: it is the only book in the series where the characters remain at Marlinspike Hall, Captain Haddock&#x27;s family estate, and neither travel abroad nor confront dangerous criminals. The plot concerns the visit of the opera singer Bianca Castafiore and the subsequent theft of her emerald.

Although &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot; received critical acclaim for its humorous depiction of its characters following a trail of red herrings, it failed to match the commercial success of previous volumes due to the experimental nature of its narrative. It was published as a book by Casterman shortly after its conclusion. Hergé continued &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; with &quot;Flight 714 to Sydney&quot;, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. The story was adapted for both the 1991 Ellipse/Nelvana animated series &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; and the 1992–93 BBC Radio 5 dramatisation of the &quot;Adventures&quot;.

== Synopsis ==
Tintin and Captain Haddock are walking through the countryside of Marlinspike when they come across a Romani community camped in a garbage dump, and reunite a lost little girl named Miarka with her family there. The Romani explain that they are not allowed to camp anywhere else so Haddock invites them to the grounds of his estate, Marlinspike Hall.

Haddock has been trying to get the local stonemason Arthur Bolt to fix a broken step at Marlinspike, but he is never available. Milanese opera diva Bianca Castafiore invites herself to Marlinspike Hall. Haddock, who dislikes her company, tries to leave before she arrives but trips on the broken step and sprains his ankle. The doctor puts his foot in a cast and imposes bed rest. Castafiore then arrives with her maid, Irma, and pianist, Igor Wagner. Castafiore presents Haddock with a pet parrot and fusses over him, to his great discomfort.

The magazine &quot;Paris Flash&quot; claim that Haddock and Castafiore are engaged, on the basis of a misinterpreted interview with Professor Calculus. This results in an avalanche of congratulations from Haddock&#x27;s friends. A television crew come to Marlinspike Hall to interview Castafiore and a mysterious photographer, Gino, appears with the crew. Suddenly, Irma informs Castafiore that her jewels have been stolen, and Tintin suspects Gino who runs away during a temporary power cut. Castafiore, however, finds the jewel-case which she herself had misplaced. The next day, an angry Castafiore shows Tintin and Haddock a copy of the magazine &quot;Tempo di Roma&quot; with a picture of Castafiore taken at Marlinspike Hall without her permission, proving that Gino was only a paparazzo.

A few days later, Castafiore&#x27;s most valuable jewel, an emerald given to her by the fictional Maharajah of Gopal, goes missing. After initially questioning Irma, Nestor and Calculus, the detectives Thomson and Thompson suspect the Romani. Their suspicions are heightened when they find a pair of golden scissors belonging to Irma in Miarka&#x27;s possession, though she claims to have found them. After the Romani depart, the police start looking for them. Tintin also investigates Igor Wagner, whose behaviour he finds suspicious, but finds out that the musician is simply sneaking out to indulge in a horse-gambling habit.

Castafiore leaves for Milan to perform in the opera &quot;La gazza ladra&quot; (Italian: &quot;The Thieving Magpie&quot;). Tintin realises that the true culprit responsible for the theft of the emerald and the scissors is a magpie. He explains to Haddock that the scissors must have fallen out of the nest only to be found by Miarka. Tintin retrieves the emerald and hands it to Thomson and Thompson, who return it to Castafiore. Sometime later after Calculus, Thomson and Thompson had departed, Bolt mends the broken step, only for Haddock to inadvertently step on it and slip again while the cement is still wet.

== History ==
=== Background ===
Following the culmination of the previous story, &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot; (1960), Hergé began planning his next adventure, seeking advice from the cartoonist Greg. Greg produced two plot outlines, &quot;Les Pilulues&quot; (&quot;The Pills&quot;) and &quot;Tintin et le Thermozéro&quot; (&quot;Tintin and the Thermozero&quot;). Hergé began drawing the latter of these stories, but soon abandoned it. Instead, he decided to set his new &quot;Adventure&quot; entirely at Marlinspike Hall, the only installment in the series to do this. This was the first and last adventure after &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; (1943) to be set entirely in Belgium, and he admitted that with his proposed scenario, it was difficult &quot;to create suspense, a semblance of danger&quot;. The titles that Hergé had previously considered for the book were: &quot;The Castafiore Affair&quot;, &quot;Castafiore&#x27;s Sapphire&quot;, &quot;The Castafiore Jewels&quot; and &quot;The Captain and the Nightingale&quot;, but &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot; eventually emerged as the favourite.

Hergé&#x27;s depiction of Bianca Castafiore in the story – a famous opera singer, pursued by the press, and changing her outfit for every occasion – was influenced by the life of the opera singer Maria Callas. One of the new characters that Hergé introduced into the story was the stonemason Arthur Bolt (M. Boullu in the original French version), whose characterisation was based on a real individual who worked for Hergé. Hergé&#x27;s depiction of the paparazzi within the story may have been influenced by his own repeat encounters with the press throughout his career. The reporter and the photographer, Christopher Willoughby-Droupe and Marco Rizotto (Jean-Loup de la Battelerie and Walter Rizotto respectively in the original French version) of the &quot;Paris Flash&quot;, are introduced into the series here, and would later be retroactively added into a re-drawing of &quot;The Black Island&quot; (1938) by Bob de Moor, also making a reappearance in &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot; (1976). The idea of having a proposed marriage between Castafiore and Haddock was based on a reader&#x27;s suggestion that Haddock marry.
On page 17 of the book, Jolyon Wagg mentions Castafiore&#x27;s Emerald to be a gift from, in his own words, &quot;some character, Marjorie something or other...&quot;, to which Castafiore corrects Wagg by saying it was from the Maharajah of Gopal. The Maharajah of Gopal does not make an appearance in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, but is one of the main characters in &quot;The Valley of the Cobras&quot; (1956), which is a part of another Franco-Belgian comics series created by Hergé, &quot;The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko&quot; (1935–1958). Hergé also introduced the Romani people, members of whose community had previously appeared in &quot;Destination New York&quot; (1951), another book from &quot;The Adventures of Jo, Zette and Jocko&quot;. The idea of including them in the story was inspired by an occasion on which Hergé came across a Romani gypsy camp near to his country home in Céroux-Mousty. To ensure that his depiction of them had some accuracy, he approached Father Rupert in Verviers, who had some experience with the community, reassuring him that &quot;the episode with the Romas will not pain you&quot;.

&quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot; was also one of the few instances of romance seen in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, which begins when Calculus breeds a new variety of white-coloured roses, and names it &quot;Bianca&quot; in honour of Castafiore. At her departure, Calculus presents a bouquet of the roses he created to Castafiore, who happily receives them and embraces Calculus, kissing him in the process. Unlike Haddock, who resents being kissed by Castafiore, Calculus willingly accepts it and blushes. Calculus also makes an imperfect attempt at colour television, which according to Michael Farr, was &quot;some five years ahead of its day&quot;.

=== Influences ===

The incident of the unwelcome band playing outside Marlinspike Hall, called the &quot;Marlinspike Prize Band&quot; (Harmonie de Moulinsart in the original French version), was based on a similar experience of Hergé&#x27;s who was also obliged to serve a band with drinks. To add insult to injury, they gave a toast to &quot;Spirou&quot;, the cartoon character created by Robert Velter. Another influence for the band was a cutting of &quot;L&#x27;Orpheon France&quot; band. Whenever Castafiore fears her jewels were stolen, her expressions, which involve placing her hands on her face, were influenced by a photograph of her model in real life, Maria Callas, taken by Cecil Beaton in 1957. In page 43 of the book, Tintin is shown reading Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s novel &quot;Treasure Island&quot; (1883), which was also one of Hergé&#x27;s favourite books. The depiction of the Romani wagons and clothing was closely modelled on photographs of Romani communities that Hergé had consulted, and he depicted members of the group engaged in basket weaving and fortune telling after reading that the Romani engaged in such activities in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.

The book alludes to the well-known French weekly &quot;Paris Match&quot; in its depiction of the reporters from the magazine &quot;Paris Flash&quot; and jibes at its reputation for the questionable accuracy of the articles. Hergé&#x27;s use of the word &quot;Paris Flash&quot; is also based on a previous encounter of his with the &quot;Paris Match&quot; when it featured an &quot;error-ridden&quot; article on him. It also mentions a fashion designing company named Tristan Bior, based upon the French luxury goods company, Christian Dior. Andy (André in the original French version), the director of the television crew belonging to the fictional company, Supavision, was compared by Farr to an employee of Belgian Television, Jacques Cogniaux. In a tribute to Auguste Piccard, Calculus&#x27; model in real life, Castafiore greets him as a famous balloonist.
Hergé also inserted references to previous stories in the narrative; he included the three models of the &quot;Unicorn&quot;, originally featured in &quot;The Secret of the Unicorn&quot;, in a background scene at Marlinspike Hall.

=== Publication ===
&quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot; was serialised weekly from 4 July 1961 to 4 September 1962 in &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine and published in book form as &quot;Les Bijoux de la Castafiore&quot; by Casterman in 1963. For the English version of the book, the gramophone record that Tintin receives from Castafiore, which is the &quot;Jewel Song&quot; from Charles Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, is titled &quot;Margarethe&quot;, the name by which Gounod&#x27;s opera is known in Germany but not in England.

&quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot; was the first book in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; that was published in England the same year1963it was published in Belgium and France. When Hergé read the English version of the book, he found it to be &quot;absolutely delirious&quot; and even suggested to translators Leslie Lonsdale-Cooper and Michael Turner: &quot;You really would think that this was originally written in English&quot;. In the original French version, Calculus ignores Haddock&#x27;s attempt to refer to the latest developments of colour television in the United States when presenting his prototype; this does not occur in the English edition.

== Critical analysis ==
The book was considered by critics to be an antithesis of the previous Tintin ventures. Michael Farr, author of &quot;Tintin: The Complete Companion&quot;, stated that in &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot;, Hergé permits Haddock to remain at home in Marlinspike, an ideal that the &quot;increasingly travel weary&quot; character had long cherished, further stating that if Hergé had decided to end the Tintin series, &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot; would have been &quot;a suitable final volume&quot;. He compared the story to the detective novels by Agatha Christie, in that the narrative was &quot;littered from start to finish with clues, most of which are false&quot;, misleading both Tintin and the reader. He felt that in setting the story entirely at Marlinspike, Hergé &quot;deliberately broke the classic adventure mould he had created&quot;, and in doing so &quot;succeeded in creating a masterpiece in the manner of a well constructed stage comedy or farce&quot;. Farr viewed the volume as &quot;a tour de force&quot;, noting that it was quite dissimilar to any other instalment in &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. As such, he felt that it would have been a suitable story on which to end the series. As a result of its &quot;experimental, exceptional nature&quot;, Farr believed that &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot; &quot;never gained the public recognition it merits&quot;, stating that while attracting &quot;a loyal following&quot; it had not become one of the most popular &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot;, something that he thought was &quot;unjust&quot;.

Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier, co-authors of the book, &quot;The Pocket Essential Tintin&quot;, described Hergé&#x27;s depiction of Castafiore in the story as &quot;a force of nature&quot;, praising the way that he depicted her many outfit changes. They described Mr Bolt as being both a &quot;Godot-like character&quot; and as being akin to Basil Fawlty from the British sitcom &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;, while adding that the broken step acts &quot;like a Greek God&#x27;s curse&quot; in the story that affects everyone except Castafiore.
They interpreted &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot; as Hergé&#x27;s &quot;Nouveau Roman&quot;, in which he realises that he cannot improve upon the standard set in &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot; and thus decides to &quot;deconstruct his own myth and create the antithesis of a &quot;Tintin&quot; adventure&quot;. Given that accidents and bad luck befall most of the characters in the story, Lofficier and Lofficier described the story as &quot;a comedy of errors, a wonderful tribute to Murphy&#x27;s Law&quot;. Ultimately, they awarded the story four stars out of five.

English screenwriter and author of &quot;Tintin: Hergé and his Creation&quot; (1991), Harry Thompson stated that in &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot;, &quot;everything is topsy-turvy&quot;, with obvious villains being shown to be harmless, and alleged crimes turning out to have not happened. He thought that Haddock was a clear parallel for Hergé himself in the story, representing his own desires and frustrations. Ultimately, he considered the volume to be &quot;Hergé&#x27;s masterpiece&quot; when it came to technical issues, representing &quot;the high tide of his creative abilities&quot;.

Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters described the story as &quot;the most surprising of Tintin&#x27;s adventures&quot;, with Hergé having been &quot;determined to push his reexamination of the comic strip even further&quot;. He noted that in the story, Castafiore&#x27;s &quot;dramatic femininity&quot; disrupted the &quot;idea of sociability&quot; that pervaded Marlinspike, with its &quot;proper respect of space, a form of harmony in independence&quot;. He added that &quot;this casually alluring tale is one of the most subtly handled of the adventures; a riot of clues, both real and false, give &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot; an unequaled density&quot;, elsewhere referring to it as &quot;a catalogue of mishaps with nothing or no one spared&quot;.
He described it as having brought to the foreground the &quot;anarchist and non-conformist tendencies of Hergé&#x27;s work&quot; which had previously been shown in &quot;Quick &amp; Flupke&quot;.
He also saw the book as being &quot;a sort of flashback&quot; for Hergé, allowing him to relive events from his own past; thus, Peeters thought that the constant renovations at Marlinspike represented the constant renovations at Hergé&#x27;s country home of Céroux-Mousty, while Haddock&#x27;s time in the wheelchair represented his former wife&#x27;s Germaine time spent similarly disabled, and Castafiore was a parody of Germaine herself. Ultimately, he felt that the story – &quot;the last great adventure of Tintin&quot; – was &quot;also a swan song&quot;, for Hergé &quot;did not dare to continue down this path, where not all of his readers had followed him&quot;, and which had represented &quot;a permanent loss of innocence&quot;.

== Adaptations ==
In June 1970, a long article on &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot; by French philosopher and author, Michel Serres, appeared in the literary review, &quot;Critique&quot;, under the title, &quot;Les Bijoux distraits ou la cantatrice sauve&quot;.

In 1991, a collaboration between the French studio Ellipse and the Canadian animation company Nelvana adapted 21 of the stories into a series of episodes, each 42 minutes long. &quot;The Castafiore Emerald&quot; was the nineteenth story of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; to be adapted. Directed by Stéphane Bernasconi, the series has been praised for being &quot;generally faithful&quot;, with compositions having been actually directly taken from the panels in the original comic book.

In 2015, the story was adapted into a ballad opera, which premiered at Solvay Castle (&quot;Château de La Hulpe&quot;), in La Hulpe, Belgium. The cast included Michel de Warzee as Captain Haddock, Hélène Bernardy as Castafiore, and Amani Picci as Tintin.

<doc id="357609" wikidata="Q2160378" url="?curid=357609" title="Communist Party of Canada">
<text>The Communist Party of Canada () is a federal political party in Canada. Founded in 1921 under conditions of illegality, it is the second oldest active political party in Canada, after the Liberal Party of Canada. Although it does not currently have any parliamentary representation, the party&#x27;s candidates have previously been elected to the House of Commons, the Ontario legislature, the Manitoba legislature, and various municipal governments across the country.

The Communist Party of Canada focuses on contributing to the &quot;labour and people&#x27;s movements&quot; through extra-parliamentary activity. Throughout its history, the party has made significant contributions to Canada&#x27;s trade union, labour, and peace movements. The Communist Party of Canada participates in the International Meeting of Communist and Workers&#x27; Parties.

In 1993, Elections Canada deregistered the party and seized its assets in accordance with changes to the &quot;Canada Elections Act&quot; introduced by the Conservative government of Brian Mulroney. Then party leader Miguel Figueroa subsequently began what would become a successful thirteen-year-long legal battle against the changes, which were struck down by the Supreme Court of Canada in &quot;Figueroa v. Canada (AG)&quot;.
==History==

===Origins (1921–1928)===
Between May 23 and 25, 1921, local communists and socialists held clandestine meetings in a barn behind a farmhouse (owned by Elizabeth Farley) at 257 Metcalf Street, then in the outskirts of Guelph, Ontario. An RCMP officer, working undercover, attended the meetings. His report states that delegates attended from &quot;Winnipeg, Vancouver, Hamilton, Toronto, Montreal, Sudbury and Regina&quot; and that Soviet Russia had offered to provide funding for the group. In addition to Guelph resident Fred Farley, a member of the United Communist Party of America, the attendees named in the RCMP report included Thomas J. Bell (a lithographer born in Ireland), Lorne Cunningham (an alderman), Trevor Maguire (one of the few in the group who was born in Canada) and Florence Custance (a teacher from Toronto). The group was &quot;incessantly praising the Soviet Government of Russia, and urging the overthrow of the Government of Canada&quot;, according to the police report.

The Communist Party of Canada (CPC) was subsequently founded on May 28, 1921. Many of its founding members had worked as labour organizers and as anti-war activists and had belonged to groups such as the Socialist Party of Canada, One Big Union, the Socialist Labour Party, the Industrial Workers of the World, and other socialist, Marxist, or Labour parties or clubs and organizations. The first members felt inspired by the Russian Revolution, and radicalized by the negative aftermath of World War I and the fight to improve living standards and labour rights, including the experience of the Winnipeg General Strike. The Comintern accepted the party as its Canadian section in December 1921, and thus the CPC adopted an organizational structure and policy similar to other communist parties at the time.

The party alternated between legality and illegality during the 1920s and 1930s. Because of the War Measures Act in effect at its time of creation, the party operated as the &quot;Workers&#x27; Party of Canada&quot; in February 1922 as its public face, and in March began publication of a newspaper, &quot;The Worker&quot;. When Parliament allowed the War Measures Act to lapse in 1924, the underground organization was dissolved and the party&#x27;s name was changed back to the &quot;Communist Party of Canada&quot;.

The party&#x27;s first actions included establishing a youth organization, the Young Communist League of Canada (YCL), and solidarity efforts with the Soviet Union. By 1923 the party had raised over $64,000 for the Russian Red Cross, a very large sum of money at that time. It also initiated a Canadian component of the Trade Union Educational League (TUEL) which quickly became an organic part of the labour movement with active groups in 16 of 60 labour councils and in mining and logging camps. By 1925 party membership stood at around 4,500 people, composed mainly of miners and lumber workers, and of railway, farm, and garment workers. Most of these people came from immigrant communities like Finns and Ukrainians.

The party, working with the TUEL, played a role in many bitter strikes and difficult organizing drives, and in support of militant industrial unionism. From 1922 to 1929, the provincial sections of the WPC/CPC also affiliated with the Canadian Labour Party, another expression of the CPC&#x27;s &quot;united front&quot; strategy. The CLP operated as a federated labour party. The CPC came to lead the CLP organization in several regions of the country, including Quebec, and did not run candidates during elections. In 1925 William Kolisnyk became the first communist elected to public office in North America, under the banner of the CLP in Winnipeg. The CLP itself, however, never became an effective national organization. The CPC withdrew from the CLP in 1928–1929 following a shift in Comintern policy, and the CLP folded shortly afterwards.

====Debates, arguments, and expulsions====
From 1927 to 1929, the party went through a series of policy debates and internal ideological struggles in which advocates of the ideas of Leon Trotsky, as well as proponents of what the party called &quot;North American Exceptionism&quot;, were expelled. Expellees included Maurice Spector, the editor of the party&#x27;s paper &quot;The Worker&quot; and party chairman, and Jack MacDonald (who had supported Spector&#x27;s expulsion) who resigned as the party&#x27;s general secretary for factionalism, and was expelled. The Secretary of the Women&#x27;s Bureau and later, general editor of the &quot;Woman Worker&quot; (1926–1929) Florence Custance was only saved from expulsion from the Party due to her untimely death in 1929. Her feminism and advocacy of birth control, for example, were well known to the mainstream press, but her radical contemporaries questioned her political sympathies and gave her few chances to shine.

MacDonald, also sympathetic to Trotskyist ideas, joined Spector in founding the International Left Opposition (Trotskyist) Canada, which formed part of Trotsky&#x27;s so-called Fourth International Left Opposition. The party also expelled supporters of Nikolai Bukharin and of Jay Lovestone&#x27;s Right Opposition, such as William Moriarty. The CPC disagreed internally over strategy, tactics, the socialist identity of the Soviet Union, and over Canada&#x27;s status as an imperialist power. While some communists like J. B. Salsberg expressed sympathy with these positions, the vast majority of members had decided to continue with the party by the early 1930s, after debates that dominated party conventions for a couple of years.

Tim Buck was elected as party general secretary in 1929. He remained in the position until 1962.

===Great Depression (1929–1938)===
The stock market crash in late 1929 signalled the beginning of a long and protracted economic crisis in Canada and internationally. The crisis quickly led to widespread unemployment, poverty, destitution, and suffering among working families and farmers. The general election of 1930, brought to power the R.B. Bennett Conservative government which attacked the labour movement and established &quot;relief camps&quot; for young unemployed men.

The CPC made a systemic critique of the depression as an alleged crisis of capitalism. It was also the first political party in Canada to call for the introduction of unemployment insurance, a national health insurance scheme, universally accessible education, social and employment assistance to youth, labour legislation including health and safety regulations, regulation of the working day and holidays, a minimum wage for women and youth, and state-run crop insurance and price control for farmers.

The party&#x27;s offices were raided by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Further, eight party members were arrested, including Buck and Tom McEwen, under Section 98 of Canada&#x27;s &quot;Criminal Code&quot;, which outlawed advocacy of force or violence to bring about political change. The party and the Workers&#x27; Unity League (WUL) launched a campaign calling for their release and presented a petition with 450,000 signatures to Prime Minister R. B. Bennett in November 1933. They demanded the release of the prisoners, an investigation into Buck&#x27;s attempted murder, and the repeal of Section 98. After the prisoners were released a rally was held in Maple Leaf Gardens in 1934, with 17,000 in attendance and 8,000 unable to attend due to there not being enough space. &quot;Eight Men Speak&quot; was created based on the events.

Although the party was banned, it organized large mass organizations such as the WUL and the Canadian Labour Defence League, which played an important role in historic strikes like that of miners in Estevan. From 1933 to 1936, the WUL led 90% of the strikes in Canada. Already, conditions had taught social democrats, reformists, and the communists important lessons of cooperation. In 1934, in accordance with the re-examined position of the Comintern, the CPC adopted a strategy and tactics based on a united front against fascism.

In the prairies, communists organized the Farmers Unity League, which mobilized against farm evictions. They rallied hundreds or thousands of farmers into demonstration Hunger Marches that encountered police brutality. In 1936, James Litterick was elected as an MLA for Winnipeg, the first CPC member to be elected to Manitoba&#x27;s legislature.

Party members were also active in the Congress of Industrial Organizations&#x27; attempt to unionize the auto and other industrial sectors including Steelworkers, the Canadian Seamen&#x27;s Union, the Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers Union, the International Woodworkers of America, and the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America.

Among the poor and unemployed, communists organized groups like the left-wing Workers Sports Association, one of the few ways that working-class youth had access to recreational programmes. The Relief Camp Workers&#x27; Union and the National Unemployed Workers Association played significant roles in organizing the unskilled and the unemployed in protest marches and demonstrations and campaigns such as the On-to-Ottawa Trek and the 1938 Vancouver Post Office sit-down strike.

The party organized the mobilization of the Mackenzie-Papineau Battalion to fight in the Spanish Civil War as a part of the International Brigade. Among the leading Canadian communists involved was Norman Bethune, known for his invention of a mobile blood-transfusion unit, early advocacy of Medicare in Canada, and work with the Chinese Communist Party during the Second Sino-Japanese War.

Solidarity efforts for the Spanish Civil War and many labour and social struggles during the Depression resulted in much cooperation between members of the CPC and the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF). After 1935 the CPC advocated electoral alliances and unity with the CCF on key issues. The proposal was debated in the CCF, with the 1936 BC, Alberta and Saskatchewan conventions generally supporting cooperation while the Ontario convention opposed. While the motion was defeated at the CCF&#x27;s third federal convention, the CPC continued to call for a united front.

The call was particularly urgent in Quebec, where in 1937 the Duplessis government passed &quot;an act to protect Quebec against communist propaganda&quot;, which gave the police the power to padlock any premises used by &quot;communists&quot; (which was undefined in the legislation).

Another mass organization organized by the party was the Canadian League for Peace and Democracy, founded in 1934 as the Canadian League Against War and Fascism.

===World War II (1939–1945)===

Although the CPC had worked hard to warn Canadians about what it considered to be a growing fascist danger, the CPC saw the opening of World War II not as an anti-fascist war but a battle between capitalist nations. This was due to the Soviet Union having signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with Nazi Germany.

The CPC&#x27;s opposition to World War II led to it being banned under the &quot;Defence of Canada Regulations&quot; of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; in 1940 shortly after Canada entered into the war. In many cases communist leaders were interned in camps, long before fascists. As growing numbers of CPC leaders were interned, some members went underground or exile in the United States. Conditions in the camps were harsh. A civil rights campaign was launched by the wives of many of the interned men for family visits and their release.

Dorise Nielsen was elected to Parliament of Canada in the 1940 election, the only woman to do so, with the support of the CPC as a part of the Progressive Unity&#x27;s popular front. Nielsen kept her membership in the party a secret until 1943.

With Germany&#x27;s 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union and the collapse of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, the party argued that the nature of the war had changed to a genuine anti-fascist struggle. The CPC reversed its opposition to the war and argued the danger to the working class on the international level superseded its interests nationally.

A.A. MacLeod and Salsberg were elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario during the 1943 election while Fred Rose was elected to parliament in a by-election, the only open Communist to do so.

During the Conscription Crisis of 1944, the banned CPC set up &quot;Tim Buck Plebiscite Committees&quot; across the country to campaign for a &quot;yes&quot; vote in the national referendum on conscription. Following the vote, the committees were renamed the Dominion Communist–Labour Total War Committee and urged full support for the war effort, a no-strike pledge for the duration of the war and increased industrial production. The National Council for Democratic Rights was also established with A.E. Smith as chair in order to rally for the legalization of the CPC and the release of communists and anti-fascists from internment.

===Cold War era (1945–1991)===

====Party ban and the Labour-Progressives====

The CPC remained banned, but with the entry of the Soviet Union into the war and the eventual release of the Canadian party&#x27;s interned leaders, Canadian communists founded the Labour-Progressive Party (LPP) in 1943 as a legal front and thereafter ran candidates under that name until 1959. At its height in the mid-1940s, the party had fourteen sitting elected officials at the federal, provincial and municipal level. Several prominent elected party members were:
* Dorise Nielsen, a Saskatchewan MP elected as a Unity candidate in 1940, declared her affiliation with the LPP when it was formed in August 1943 and ran unsuccessfully for re-election as an LPP candidate.
* Mary Kardash and William Ross were LPP and then Communist school trustees in Winnipeg
* Jacob Penner and Joseph Zuken were popular aldermen in Winnipeg. Zuken was an LPP school trustee before succeeding Penner on city council by which time the LPP had changed its name back to the Communist Party of Canada.
* Bill Kardash and James Litterick were Manitoba LPP Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs).
* Alexander A. Parent was an LPP member and president of UAW Local 195, elected as the Liberal-Labour MPP for Essex North in 1945. Broke with the Liberals in 1946 and spent the remainder of his term as a Labour MPP working with the two LPP MPPs, MacLeod and Salsberg. He did not run for re-election in 1948.
* Stanley Bréhaut Ryerson, Sam Carr, Charles Simms and Norman Freed were LPP Toronto aldermen while Stewart Smith was elected to the city&#x27;s Board of Control, Edna Ryerson, Elizabeth Morton and John Boyd were elected to the School Board in 1944.
* Harry Rankin sat on Vancouver&#x27;s city council on behalf of the Committee of Progressive Electors which he helped found in the late 1960s. Though not officially a CPC member he was a fellow traveller.
* James Wallace was a councillor in the village of Long Branch, a Toronto suburb, from 1942 to 1952.
* The small rural municipality of Clayton, Saskatchewan elected a Communist mayor to one of its tiny towns
* Blairmore, Alberta elected a Communist majority town council and school board in 1933 and renamed the main street &quot;Tim Buck Avenue&quot; and the main park &quot;Karl Marx Park&quot;

In 1945, Igor Gouzenko, a cipher clerk at the Soviet Embassy, defected to Canada and alleged that several Canadian communists were operating a spy ring which provided the Soviet Union with top secret information. The Kellock-Taschereau Commission was called by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King to investigate the matter. This led to the convictions of Fred Rose and other communists.

Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s 1956 Secret Speech criticizing the rule of Joseph Stalin and the 1956 Soviet invasion of Hungary shook the faith of many communists around the world. The party was also riven by a crisis following the return of prominent party member J.B. Salsberg from a trip to the Soviet Union where he found rampant party-sponsored antisemitism. Salsberg reported his findings but they were rejected by the party, which suspended him from its leading bodies. The crisis resulted in the departure of the United Jewish Peoples&#x27; Order, Salsberg, Robert Laxer and most of the party&#x27;s Jewish members in 1956. Many, perhaps most, members of the CPC left, including a number of prominent party members. 

In the mid-1960s, the United States Department of State estimated the party membership to be approximately 3,500. The Soviet Union&#x27;s 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia caused more people to leave the CPC. Many women were likewise deterred from engaging with the party as it was somewhat resistant to women&#x27;s politics at the time. The party may have countered that the discussions of sex, gender, and women&#x27;s politics held the potential to veer away from the overarching goal of class revolution, for example, many radical women recalled the hypocrisy of party men who refused to discuss sex despite carrying on numerous extramarital affairs.

The party was also active in indigenous people&#x27;s struggles. For example, James P. Brady and Malcom Norris were founders of the Métis Associations of Saskatchewan and Alberta in the 1940s and 1950s.

====Soviet Bloc collapse and party split====
In common with most communist parties, it went through a crisis after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and subsequently split. Under then general secretary George Hewison (1988–1991), the leadership of the CPC and a segment of its general membership began to abandon Marxism–Leninism as the basis of the party&#x27;s revolutionary perspective, and ultimately moved to liquidate the party itself, seeking to replace it with a more moderate entity.

The protracted ideological and political crisis created much confusion and disorientation within the ranks of the Party, and paralysed both its independent and united front work for over two years. The Hewison-led majority in the party&#x27;s central committee voted to abandon Marxism–Leninism. An orthodox minority in the central committee, led by Miguel Figueroa, Elizabeth Rowley and former leader William Kashtan, resisted this effort. At the 28th Convention in the fall of 1990, the Hewison group managed to maintain its control of the central committee, but by the spring of 1991, the membership began to turn more and more against the reformist policies and orientation of the Hewison leadership.

Key provincial conventions were held in 1991 in the two main provincial bases of the CPC: British Columbia and Ontario. At the BC convention, delegates threw out Fred Wilson, one of the main leaders of the Hewison group. A few months later in June 1991, Ontario delegates rejected a concerted campaign by Hewison and his supporters, and overwhelmingly reelected provincial leader Elizabeth Rowley and other supporters of the Marxist–Leninist current to the Ontario Committee and Executive.

The Hewison group moved on August 27, 1991, to expel eleven of the key leaders of the opposition, including Rowley, Emil Bjarnason, and former central organizer John Bizzell. The Hewison-controlled Central Executive also dismissed the Ontario provincial committee.

The vast majority of local clubs and committees of the CPC opposed the expulsions, and called instead for an extraordinary convention of the party to resolve the deepening crisis in a democratic manner. There were loud protests at the central committee&#x27;s October 1991 meeting, but an extraordinary convention was not convened. With few remaining options, Rowley and the other expelled members threatened to take the Hewison group to court. After several months of negotiations between the Hewison group and the opposition &quot;All-Canada Negotiating Committee&quot;, an out-of-court settlement resulted in the Hewison leadership agreeing to leave the CPC and relinquish any claim to the party&#x27;s name, while taking most of the party&#x27;s assets to the Cecil-Ross Society, a publishing and educational foundation previously associated with the party.

Following the departure of the Hewison-led group, a convention was held in December 1992 at which delegates agreed to continue the CPC (thus the meeting was titled the 30th CPC Convention). Delegates rejected the reformist policies instituted by the Hewison group and instead reaffirmed the CPC as a Marxist–Leninist organization. Since most of the old party&#x27;s assets were now the property of the Hewison-led Cecil Ross Society, the CPC convention decided to launch a new newspaper, the &quot;People&#x27;s Voice&quot;, to replace the old &quot;Canadian Tribune&quot;. The convention elected a new central committee with Figueroa as Party Leader. The convention also amended the party constitution to grant more membership control and lessen the arbitrary powers of the central committee, while maintaining democratic centralism as its organizational principle.

Meanwhile, the former communists retained the Cecil-Ross Society as a political foundation to continue their political efforts. They also sold off the party&#x27;s headquarters at 24 Cecil Street, having earlier liquidated various party-related business such as Eveready Printers (the party printshop) and Progress Publishers. The name of the Cecil-Ross Society comes from the intersection of Cecil Street and Ross Street in Toronto where the headquarters of the party was located. The Cecil-Ross Society took with it the rights to the &quot;Canadian Tribune&quot;, which had been the party&#x27;s weekly newspaper for decades, as well as roughly half of the party&#x27;s assets. The Cecil-Ross Society ended publication of the &quot;Canadian Tribune&quot; and attempted to launch a new broad-left magazine, &quot;New Times&quot; which failed after a few issues and then &quot;Ginger&quot; which was only published twice.

===Recent history (1992–present)===
The renovated party, although with a much smaller membership and resources, now faced further challenges and threats to its existence. Changes to the &quot;Canada Elections Act&quot;, introduced by the Conservative government of Brian Mulroney and passed by Parliament in the spring of 1993, required that any political party which failed to field 50 candidates in a general federal election would be automatically deregistered and its assets seized. The CPC was not in a position to run 50 candidates in the 1993 federal election (it fielded only eight candidates during that election), and therefore its assets were seized and the party was deregistered. The CPC had sought an interim injunction to prevent its imminent de-registration, but this legal action failed.

A prolonged ten-year political and legal battle, &quot;Figueroa v. Canada (AG)&quot; ensued, which won the support of widespread popular opinion, reflected in a number of members of parliament openly supporting the challenge and other small political parties joining the case, most notably the Green Party. Never before had a single court challenge resulted in legislative action on three separate occasions to amend a standing law. Bill C-2 (2000) amended the &quot;Canada Elections Act&quot; to (among other things) remove the unconstitutional seizure of party assets for failure to field 50 candidates in a general election and provided for the full refund of candidates&#x27; deposits. The party had its deregistration overturned and its seized assets restored. Bill C-9 (2001) reduced the threshold from 50 to 12 candidates for the party identifier to appear on the ballot. After the Supreme Court of Canada ruled unanimously to strike down the 50-candidate threshold as unconstitutional, the Chretien government was forced to introduce and pass Bill C-3 (2003), which scrapped the rule altogether for party registration. This victory was celebrated by many of the other small parties – regardless of political differences – on the principle that it was a victory for the people&#x27;s right to democratic choice.

During this time the, CPC began to reorganize its Quebec section, the Communist Party of Quebec ( or PCQ). The CPC also began periodically publishing &quot;Spark!&quot;, a journal for Marxist theory and discussion. In 2001 the party adopted a comprehensive update to its party programme and renamed it &quot;Canada&#x27;s Future is Socialism&quot;.

The CPC reinvigorated its long-standing involvement in and contribution to the labour movement and support of trade union organizing and campaigns, in the civic reform movement, and in a number of social justice, anti-war and international solidarity groups and coalitions. The YCL was reestablished in 2007 and has since set up local branches in a number of cities across Canada and held several central conventions.

The CPC held its 37th Central Convention in February 2013 in Toronto. According to a &quot;Toronto Star&quot; article the assembly drew 65 delegates most of whom were from Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec with a few from Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Nova Scotia. Party leader Miguel Figueroa called for the CPC to field 25 candidates in the upcoming federal election.

Owing to his declining health, Miguel Figueroa stepped down as central party leader in 2015 after serving in the position for 23 years. Elizabeth Rowley subsequently became the first woman leader of the party after being elected central party leader by the central committee on January 31, 2016. Under Rowley&#x27;s leadership, the party ran 30 candidates in the 2019 Canadian federal election and finished in twelfth, receiving 3,905 votes and a total of 0.02% of the popular vote.

The CPC held its 38th Central Convention in May 2016, again in Toronto. The meeting drew about 70–80 delegates from Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec, Manitoba, Alberta, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and New Brunswick, in order of delegation size. The party held a special tribute to outgoing leader Miguel Figueroa.

In June 2022, allegations of sexual harassment by a party organizer surfaced on social media. The central committee&#x27;s response was perceived as inadequate by some within the party. This resulted in an internal party schism that led to the resignations or expulsions of a number of party members.

==Quebec and the national question==
The Communist Party of Canada began organizing in Quebec upon its founding. Many important leaders of the CPC including Annie Buller, William Kashtan, Fred Rose, Madeleine Parent, and Léa Roback hailed from Montreal, and Norman Bethune joined the party in Montreal. The Quebec district fought hard battles against the Duplessis regime, which made the party illegal using the Padlock Law, and to organize the unorganized. The election of Fred Rose in Cartier was a major boost to the Quebec communists and reflected the support of the CPC among working-class people in the city.

For some time the party had been struggling to develop its policy on the national question in Canada, which had changed considerably since the party&#x27;s formation. As early as the 1930s the CPC recognized Quebec was a nation and by the late 1940s the party began to advocate for Quebec&#x27;s right to self-determination. In the 1950s and 1960s the party clarified this position, becoming the first party to advocate for a democratic solution to the national question and a new &quot;made-in-Canada&quot; constitution that would guarantee sovereignty for Quebec, up to and including separation. While supporting the right to separate, the communists opposed the secession of Quebec from Canada, proposing a new equal and voluntary partnership between what was then commonly called French and English Canada.

In the late 1950s, the party finally overturned the Padlock Law, giving new energy and hope to the party despite difficult times with the Khrushchev revelations and the continued pressure of the Cold War. Moving to better put into practice what it saw as a deeper political understanding of the national question, the CPC in Quebec re-organized as the Communist Party of Quebec ( or PCQ) in November 1965, reflecting what it now termed the multi-national reality of Canada as &quot;a state with more than one nation within its borders&quot;. The PCQ emerged as a &quot;distinct entity&quot; of the CPC, with shared membership and, at the same time, full control over its policies and administration including its own constitution.

With the Quiet Revolution, Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism and later the October Crisis, the party&#x27;s position on the national question became the subject of broad debate across the country, and influenced the agreement of the Canadian Labour Congress to work with the Quebec Federation of Labour on an equal and voluntary basis. The communists called for workers sympathetic with independence movements to unite on a common, immediate class-based programme of common struggle with English-speaking Canadian workers. The PCQ helped re-launch Montreal&#x27;s mass May Day demonstrations and advanced many unique policies including the idea of a federated party of labour, which proved its prescience with the formation of Québec solidaire. The federated party of labour proposal was endorsed by the late 1960s by most trade union centrals, but the project was eclipsed by the emergence of the Parti Quebecois.

By the 1980s, the CPC and PCQ were calling for &quot;a new, democratic constitutional arrangement based on the equal and voluntary union of Aboriginal peoples, Québec, and English-speaking Canada&quot; replacing the Senate with a house of nations. In this context the PCQ and CPC critically supported the first referendum question on sovereignty association, while later the CPC advocated voting No on the second referendum in 1995.

During the crisis in CPC during the 1990s, the PCQ became disorganized, closed its offices, and its remaining members drifted apart from the CPC, with many in the leadership adopting positions sympathetic to nationalism. It was not until 1997 that a range of communists and communist groups came together to re-organize the PCQ. A few years later the party helped bring together different tendencies in the left to form the Union of Progressive Forces (UFP) which became Québec solidaire.

The UFP agreed to place the question of Quebec independence as secondary to social or class issues. This was hotly debated as the party transformed into Québec solidaire. The debate moved over into the PCQ as well. These positions were questioned by the Quebec leader of the party, André Parizeau, who formulated a series of amendments in support of immediate independence in 2004 which were rejected by both the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Quebec party (by a vote of 4–2) and by the Central Executive Committee of the Canadian party (by a vote of 7–1). In January 2005, Parizeau wrote a letter to PCQ members declaring that the party was in crisis and, describing the four NEC members who opposed his amendments as a pro-federalist &quot;Gang of Four&quot;, he summarily dismissed them. Although his Quebec nationalist point of view held a slim majority at the PCQ&#x27;s convention of April 2005, the delegate selection process was highly disputed. Parizeau was subsequently expelled by the Central Committee of the CPC for factionalism and actions harmful to the party. Around the same time, his group announced their withdrawal from the CPC. Élections Québec continued to recognize Parizeau as holding the electoral registration for the name &quot;&quot;, prompting the PCQ to begin using the abbreviation PCQ-PCC to distinguish itself from Parizeau&#x27;s group.

The party&#x27;s central committee affirmed the authority of the previous PCQ National Executive Committee on June 18–19, 2005. The PCQ-PCC then held a new convention which resulted in the revival of the French-language communist periodical &quot;Clarté&quot;, the opening of a new office and reading room, the launch of a new website, and the party&#x27;s reaffiliation with Quebec Solidaire. The PCQ-PCC works closely with the youth organization Ligue de la jeunesse communiste du Quebec. The CPC&#x27;s account of this situation is available online, as is the letter from Parizeau&#x27;s PCQ group.

==Membership==
The CPC had a membership of about 4,500 people in 1925, consisting mainly of miners, lumberers, railway workers, farmers, and garment workers. Party membership soared in the 1940s, peaking at just under 20,000 in January 1946. However, during this time the CPC&#x27;s membership in Quebec only amounted to several hundred members.

Women made up 12 to 15% of the CPC&#x27;s membership from 1934 to 1938, rising to 28% by 1951.

According to Canadian historian Ivan Avakumović, the CPC had 1,500 to 3,000 members during the 1960s. However, the United States Department of State estimated the CPC&#x27;s membership to be approximately 3,500 in the mid-1960s.

==Publications==
The CPC publishes the biweekly newspaper &quot;People&#x27;s Voice&quot;, which has been in circulation since 1993. The party&#x27;s previous newspapers include &quot;The Worker&quot;, &quot;Canadian Tribune&quot;, and &quot;The Tribune&quot;.

Additionally, the CPC&#x27;s British Columbia section published many newspapers of its own, such as the &quot;B.C. Worker&#x27;s News&quot; (1935–1937), &quot;People&#x27;s Advocate&quot; (1937–1940), &quot;Vancouver Clarion&quot; (1940–1941), &quot;Pacific Advocate&quot; (1942–1945), and &quot;Pacific Tribune&quot; (1946–1992).

==Allied organizations==
Historically, the CPC has had allied organizations which were affiliated with the party until the late-1920s, when these affiliates were hitherto understood to be largely following the party&#x27;s direction. These groups often originated from left-wing labour and socialist movements that existed prior to the creation of the Communist Party and operated political and cultural activities amongst various immigrant groups, published magazines and operated their own cultural centres and meeting halls. From the 1920s through the 1950s the largest immigrant groups represented in the party were Finns, Ukrainians and Jews who were organized in the Finnish Organization of Canada (founded in 1911 as the Finnish Socialist Organization of Canada), the Association of United Ukrainian Canadians (known as the Ukrainian Labour Farmer Temple Association until 1946) and the United Jewish Peoples&#x27; Order (known as the Labour League until 1945) respectively.

Also active in the 1930s and 1940s were the Hungarian Workers Clubs, the Polish People&#x27;s Association (formerly the Polish Workers&#x27; and Farmers&#x27; Association and later known as the Polish Democratic Association after World War II), the Serbian People&#x27;s Movement and Croatian Cultural Association (formerly the Jugoslav Workers&#x27; Clubs) and the Carpatho-Russian Society. The Russian Farmer-Worker Clubs were formed in the early 1930s but closed by the government under the Defence of Canada Regulations at the outbreak of World War II. When the Soviet Union became Canada&#x27;s ally in 1942, they re-appeared as the Federation of Russian Canadians. The German Canadian Federation was formed during World War II and the Canadian Slav Committee was formed in 1948 in an attempt to put party-aligned cultural associations for Ukrainians, Russians, Poles, Slovaks, Bulgarians, Macedonians, Yugoslavs, and Carpatho-Rusyns under one umbrella.

The Society of Capartho-Russian Canadians re-formed and, in 1950, acquired a hall at 280 Queen Street West in Toronto which it continues to operate into the twenty-first century.

The UJPO broke with the party in 1956 during the period of the &quot;Khrushchev revelations&quot; and allegations of antisemitism in the Soviet Union.

Later allied organizations include the Greek Canadian Democratic Organization formed by leftists emigres who had fled the Greek military junta of 1967–1974 and the Portuguese Canadian Democratic Association which was formed by left-wing emigres who had left Portugal in the 1960s and early 1970s when it was still ruled by a right wing dictatorship. The Portuguese association was outspoken in its support of the 1974 Carnation Revolution.

==Provincial sections==
The Communist Party of Canada has provincial sections which contest general elections at the provincial level. In most provinces the provincial section&#x27;s name is in the format &quot;Communist Party of Canada ([Province])&quot;. Active provincial sections exist in Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec; the party was previously active in Saskatchewan as well.

==Leadership==

===Party leaders===
The following is a list of party leaders since 1921. The party leader was known as the &quot;General Secretary of the Communist Party of Canada&quot; from 1921 to 1992.
===Chairmen===
The Chairman of the Communist Party of Canada was a largely ceremonial position which existed from 1921 to 1973. The following is a list of known party chairmen.
===Central convention===
The party holds a central convention in Toronto every three years, in which delegates from party clubs across Canada elect the party leadership. Delegates elect the members of the Central Committee who in turn nominate the members of the Central Executive Committee (CEC). The composition of the CEC is then ratified by the delegates to the convention through a simple majority.

==Election results==
At its height in the mid-1940s, the CPC had 14 sitting elected officials at the federal, provincial and municipal levels, including federal Member of Parliament Fred Rose, who was elected in 1945, the year in which the CPC&#x27;s proportion of the federal election vote was its highest ever at 2.13%. In the 1953 federal election, the CPC ran 100 candidates, its most ever; however, it only received only 1.06% of the national vote. Those one hundred candidates encompassed seven provinces and included 22 women, as well as 11 young adults.

<doc id="357616" wikidata="Q7112734" url="?curid=357616" title="Outline of software engineering">
<text>The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to software engineering:

[[Software engineering]] – application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is the application of engineering to software.

The ACM Computing Classification system is a poly-hierarchical ontology that organizes the topics of the field and can be used in semantic web applications and as a de facto standard classification system for the field. The major section &quot;Software and its Engineering&quot; provides an outline and ontology for software engineering.

== Software applications ==
Software engineers build software (applications, operating systems, system software) that people use.

Applications influence software engineering by pressuring developers to solve problems in new ways. For example, consumer software emphasizes low cost, medical software emphasizes high quality, and Internet commerce software emphasizes rapid development.

*Engineering All traditional engineering branches use software extensively. Engineers use spreadsheets, more than they ever used calculators. Engineers use custom software tools to design, analyze, and simulate their own projects, like bridges and power lines. These projects resemble software in many respects, because the work exists as electronic documents and goes through analysis, design, implementation, and testing phases. Software tools for engineers use the tenets of computer science; as well as the tenets of calculus, physics, and chemistry.

<text>The Territory of Oregon was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from August 14, 1848, until February 14, 1859, when the southwestern portion of the territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Oregon. Originally claimed by several countries (see Oregon Country), Spanish &quot;El Orejón&quot; was part of the Territorio de Nutca (1789–1795), later in the 19th century, the region was divided between the British Empire and the US in 1846. When established, the territory encompassed an area that included the current states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho, as well as parts of Wyoming and Montana. The capital of the territory was first Oregon City, then Salem, followed briefly by Corvallis, then back to Salem, which became the state capital upon Oregon&#x27;s admission to the Union.

==Background==
Originally inhabited by Native Americans, the region that became the Oregon Territory was explored by Europeans first by sea. The first documented voyage of exploration was made in 1777 by the Spanish, and both British and American vessels visited the region not long thereafter. Subsequent land-based exploration by Alexander Mackenzie and the Lewis and Clark Expedition and development of the fur trade in the region strengthened the competing claims of Great Britain and the United States.

The competing interests of the two foremost claimants were addressed in the Treaty of 1818, which sanctioned a &quot;joint occupation&quot;, by British and Americans, of a vast &quot;Oregon Country&quot; (as the American side called it) that comprised the present-day U.S. states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho, parts of Montana and Wyoming, and the portion of what is now the Canadian province of British Columbia south of the parallel 54°40′ north.

==Formation==

During the period of joint occupation, most activity in the region outside of the activities of the indigenous people came from the fur trade, which was dominated by the British Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Over time, some trappers began to settle down in the area and began farming, and missionaries started to arrive in the 1830s. Some settlers also began arriving in the late 1830s, and covered wagons crossed the Oregon Trail beginning in 1841. At that time, the only governments that existed in the Oregon Country were the individual local Native Americans communities, as no one nation held dominion over the territory.

A group of settlers in the Willamette Valley began meeting in 1841 to discuss organizing a government for the area. These earliest documented discussions, mostly concerning forming a government, were held in an early pioneer and Native American encampment and later town known as Champoeg, Oregon. These first Champoeg Meetings eventually led to further discussions, and in 1843 the creation of the Provisional Government of Oregon. In 1846, the Oregon boundary dispute between the U.S. and Britain was settled with the signing of the Oregon Treaty.

The United States federal government left their part of the region unorganized for two years until news of the Whitman massacre reached the United States Congress and helped to facilitate the organization of the region into a U.S. territory. On August 14, 1848, Congress passed the Act to Establish the Territorial Government of Oregon, which created what was officially the Territory of Oregon. The Territory of Oregon originally encompassed all of the present-day states of Idaho, Oregon and Washington, as well as those parts of present-day Montana and Wyoming west of the Continental Divide. Its southern border was the 42nd parallel north (the boundary of the Adams-Onis Treaty of 1819), and it extended north to the 49th parallel. Oregon City, Oregon, was designated as the first capital.

==Government==
The territorial government consisted of a governor, a marshal, a secretary, an attorney, and a three-judge supreme court. Judges on the court also sat as trial level judges as they rode circuit across the territory. All of these offices were filled by appointment by the President of the United States. The two-chamber Oregon Territorial Legislature was responsible for passing laws, with seats in both the upper-chamber council and lower-chamber house of representatives filled by local elections held each year.

Taxation took the form of an annual property tax of 0.25% for territorial purposes with an additional county tax not to exceed this amount. This tax was to be paid on all town lots and improvements, mills, carriages, clocks and watches, and livestock; farmland and farm products were not taxed. In addition, a poll tax of 50 cents for every qualified voter under age 60 was assessed and a graduated schedule of merchants&#x27; licenses established, ranging from the peddlar&#x27;s rate of $10 per year to a $60 annual fee on firms with more than $20,000 of capital.

==Gaining statehood==
Oregon City served as the seat of government from 1848 to 1851, followed by Salem from 1851 to 1855. Corvallis served briefly as the capital in 1855, followed by a permanent return to Salem later that year. In 1853, as a result of the Monticello Convention and its approval by Congress and President Millard Fillmore, the portion of the territory north of the lower Columbia River and north of the 46th parallel east of the river was organized into the Washington Territory.
 The Oregon Constitutional Convention was held in 1857 to draft a constitution in preparation for becoming a state, with the convention delegates approving the document in September, and then general populace approving the document in November.

In 1850, 10 years after the end of the Second Great Awakening (1790–1840), of the 9 churches with regular services in the Oregon Territory, 5 were Catholic, 1 was Baptist, 1 was Congregational, 1 was Methodist, and 1 was Presbyterian. In the 1850 United States census, 10 counties in the Oregon Territory (7 counties in contemporary Oregon and 3 in contemporary Washington) reported the following population counts:
On February 14, 1859, the territory entered the Union as the U.S. state of Oregon within its current boundaries. The remaining eastern portion of the territory (the portions in present-day southern Idaho and western Wyoming) was added to the Washington Territory.

<doc id="357629" wikidata="Q1067781" url="?curid=357629" title="Charter of the French Language">
<text>The Charter of the French Language (, ), also known as Bill 101 (, ), is a law in the Canadian province of Quebec defining French, the language of the majority of the population, as the official language of the provincial government. It is the central piece of legislation that forms Quebec&#x27;s language policy and one of the three principle statutes upon which the cohesion of Quebec&#x27;s society is based, along with the &quot;Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms&quot; and the &quot;Civil Code of Quebec&quot;. The charter also protects the Indigenous languages in Quebec.

First introduced by Camille Laurin, the Minister of Cultural Development under the first Parti Québécois government of Premier René Lévesque, it was passed by the National Assembly and received royal assent on August 26, 1977. The charter&#x27;s provisions expanded upon the 1974 &quot;Official Language Act&quot; (Bill 22), which was enacted during the tenure of Premier Robert Bourassa&#x27;s Liberal government to make French the official language of Quebec. Prior to 1974, Quebec had no official language and was subject only to the requirements on the use of English and French contained in article 133 of the &quot;British North America Act, 1867&quot;. The charter has been amended more than six times since 1977, each of which met with controversy in Quebec. Most recently, in 2022, the charter was amended (also covered in this article) by the adoption of the Act respecting French, the Official and Common Language of Quebec, commonly known as Bill 96.

==Objective==
The preamble of the Charter states that the National Assembly resolves &quot;to make French the language of Government and the Law, as well as the normal and everyday language of work, instruction, communication, commerce and business&quot;. It also states that the National Assembly shall pursue this objective &quot;in a spirit of fairness and open-mindedness&quot; and recognizes &quot;the right of the First Nations and the Inuit in Quebec, the first inhabitants of this land, to preserve and develop their original language and culture&quot;.

==Titles==
The &quot;Charter&quot; consists of six titles and two schedules:

* Title I includes nine chapters pertaining to the status of the French language, which:
** declare French the sole official language (chapter I), 
** define the fundamental language rights of persons (chapter II), and 
** define the status of French in the parliament and the courts (chapter III), the civil administration (chapter IV), the semipublic agencies (chapter V), labour relations (chapter VI), commerce and business (chapter VII) and language of instruction (chapter VIII).
* Title II includes five chapters pertaining to linguistic officialization, toponymy and the francization of the civil service and businesses.
* Title III establishes the &quot;Office québécois de la langue française&quot; (Quebec Office of the French language) and defines its mission, powers and organization.
* Title IV establishes the &quot;&quot; (Superior Council of the French language).
* Title V and VI define penal provisions and sanctions and transitional and miscellaneous provisions.

==Status of the French language==
In order to achieve the goal of making French the &quot;normal and everyday language of work, instruction, communication, commerce and business&quot; and ensure the respect of francophone Quebecers&#x27; language rights, the &quot;Charter&quot; contains a number of key provisions and various regulations.

===Official language===
In the first article of the &quot;Charter&quot;, French is declared the official language of Quebec.

The French language was previously declared the sole official language of Quebec with the adoption of the &quot;Official Language Act&quot; in 1974. Quebec is constitutionally obliged nonetheless to provide English services in the courts and the National Assembly of Quebec (see below).

===Fundamental language rights===
The fundamental French-language rights in Quebec are:

# The right to have the civil administration, the health services and social services, the public utility enterprises, the professional corporations, the associations of employees and all enterprises doing business in Quebec communicate with the public in French. (article 2)
# The right to speak French in deliberative assemblies. (article 3)
# The right of workers to carry on their activities in French. (article 4)
# The right of consumers to be informed and served in French. (article 5)
# The right of persons eligible for instruction in Quebec to receive that instruction in French. (article 6)

===Parliament and courts===
French is the declared language of the legislature and courts in Quebec. Section 133 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, still in effect, nonetheless requires that bills be printed, published, passed and assented to in French and English in the Parliament of Canada and the Legislature of Quebec.

French or English may be used by any person before the courts of Quebec. Parties may request the translation in French or English of the judgments by the courts or decisions rendered by any &quot;body discharging quasi-judicial functions&quot;.

The French text prevails over the English one, in case of any discrepancy, for any regulation to which section 133 of the &quot;Constitution Act&quot; of 1867 does not apply.

The first version of the &quot;Charter&quot; provided that laws be enacted only in French. In 1979, the related provisions (articles 7 through 13) were rendered inoperative by a ruling of the Supreme Court of Canada in &quot;Attorney General of Quebec v. Blaikie&quot;; however, Quebec responded by re-enacting in French and in English the &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot;, leaving intact articles 7 through 13.

In 1993, the &quot;Charter&quot;&#x27;s provisions related to the language of the legislature and courts were made compliant with the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling.

===Civil administration===
The government departments and agencies are designated by their French name alone, and all administrative documents are drafted and published in that official language. All communications by the administration with other governments and legal persons, between departments and internally inside departments, are conducted in the official language.

A person must have knowledge of the official language appropriate to the office for which he or she is applying.

A non-official language may be used on signs and posters of the administration, but only for health or public safety reasons.

===Semi-public agencies===
Public utilities and professional orders must provide service in the official language and use it for their internal and general communications. Professional orders may issue permits only to persons who have a knowledge of the official language appropriate to the practice of their profession.

===Labour relations===
Nineteen articles of the &quot;Charter&quot; provide for the general goal of making French the language of labour relations and ensuring each worker&#x27;s right to work in French.

Employers are to draw up written communications to all or part of their staff, including after termination of the employment relationship, in French. They are also required to publish offers of employment, transfer or promotion in the official language. An employment contract must be provided in French first to a candidate if it falls under the definition of contracts of adhesion (i.e., a contract whose main provisions are not negotiable). It is only after the parties have examined the contract&#x27;s French version that they may choose to be bound by its version in another language. Freely negotiated employment contracts may be drawn up in another language than French at the parties&#x27; express wish.

In particular, an employer cannot dismiss, lay off, demote, transfer or take reprisals against, or impose any other penalty on, a staff member on the sole account of he or she being exclusively French-speaking or of possessing insufficient knowledge of a non-official language, or because that member demanded the respect of his or her right to work in French. As a job requirement, knowledge or a specific level of knowledge of a language other than French is prohibited, unless the nature of the duties require it.

The (Employment Standards, Equity, Health and Safety Commission) arbitrates in case of disagreement over the necessity of knowing a non-official language to perform a given work. The burden of the proof is on the employer, who must satiety each the following criteria in order to meet the requirement of having taken all reasonable means to avoid requiring knowledge or a specific level of knowledge of a language other than the official language:

# The employer assessed the actual language needs associated with the duties to be performed; 
# The employer made sure that the language knowledge already required from other staff members was insufficient for the performance of those duties; and
# The employer restricted as much as possible the number of positions involving duties whose performance requires knowledge or a specific level of knowledge of a language other than the official language.

===Commerce and business===
Product labels, their instructions, manuals, warranty certificates as well as restaurant menus and wine lists must be in French. Other languages may be used, provided French&#x27;s prominence is at least equivalent.

Catalogues, brochures, folders, commercial directories and other such publications must be in French. All software (for example, video games and operating systems) must be available in French unless no such version exists.

Signs and posters must be in French, and if they include any additional language, the French must be markedly predominant. A recognized trademark within the meaning of the &quot;Trademarks Act&quot; may appear exclusively in a language other than French unless a French version has been registered. Where a trademark is displayed outside a building exclusively in a language other than French, a sufficient presence of French must also be ensured.

A number of exceptions to the general rules for commercial products, signs and advertising:

* Products destined exclusively for export;
* Educational products for the teaching of a language other than French;
* Cultural and ideological companies, groups, signs, and literature (including non-French broadcasters and newspapers); and
* Companies (usually multinational corporations) that sign an agreement with the OQLF permitting an exemption from the francization requirement. (However, the rules regarding the right of a worker to work in French still apply.)

In some parts of Quebec, like Montreal, bilingual signs with French and English text of equal sizes can be seen (such as in historically English educational institutions, and in federally regulated businesses), although French is sometimes predominant on these signs. For example, French is located to the left of other languages so that it is read before the non-French text when reading left to right. (Formerly, the size and colour of text in other languages were tightly regulated as well.)

===Application to indigenous languages===
Though article 97 clarifies that while &quot;the Indian reserves are not subject to this &quot;Act&quot;&quot;, the local indigenous languages are still subject to it off-reserve. For example, indigenous languages are not exempted from the application of article 58, whereby &quot;public signs, advertising and posters must be in French&quot;, but may be in the local indigenous language &quot;provided that French is markedly predominant&quot;.

Though article 58 does allow the provincial government to &quot;determine by regulation the places, cases, conditions or circumstances ... where French need not be predominant or where such signs, posters and advertising may be in another language only&quot;, it imposes no obligation on the government to exempt indigenous languages.

===Language of instruction===

The language of instruction from kindergarten to secondary school is French. (The instruction language is the language in which the classes are taught. Learning of English as a second language is mandatory for all children attending French school beginning in elementary school.)

Articles 87, 88 and 89 provide for the use of Indigenous languages and Inuktitut as the language of instruction. The rate of introduction of French and English as languages of instruction is left to school committees and parents&#x27; committees.

At the request of parents, the following may receive instruction in English:

# a child whose father or mother is a Canadian citizen and received elementary instruction in English anywhere in Canada, provided that that instruction constitutes the major part of the elementary instruction he or she received in Canada;
# a child whose father or mother is a Canadian citizen and who has received or is receiving elementary or secondary instruction in English in Canada, and the brothers and sisters of that child, provided that that instruction constitutes the major part of the elementary or secondary instruction received by the child in Canada.

The original 1977 &quot;Charter&quot; provided for the English instruction not on the basis of a parent having received his instruction in English in &quot;Canada&quot;, but in &quot;Quebec&quot; only. This came to be amended following the adoption of the &quot;Constitution Act 1982&quot;, which defined the educational right of French and English minorities in all provinces under section 23 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

==Office québécois de la langue française==

The (Quebec Office of the French Language) (OQLF), informally known by some Anglophones as the &quot;language police&quot;, is the commission responsible for administering policies pertaining to linguistic officialization, toponymy and francization of civil administration and businesses. It also has the mission of &quot;monitoring the linguistic situation in Quebec&quot;, promoting the official language and conducting research. In 2016–17, the budget of the OQLF was . The OQLF has seen, from time to time, criticism over some of its decisions, such as the 2013 controversy dubbed &quot;pastagate&quot;, in which it cited an Italian restaurant for having on its menu Italian words like &quot;pasta&quot;, &quot;antipasti&quot; and &quot;calamari&quot; rather than using their French equivalents. The OQLF has also objected to use of the term &quot;grilled cheese sandwich&quot;, insisting that they be called &quot;&quot;, which literally translates to &quot;melted cheese sandwich&quot;. Likewise, the OQLF objects to &quot;on/off&quot; switches and to the sale of &quot;steaks&quot;, insisting that they be called &quot;&quot;, despite the fact that &quot;steak&quot; is the more commonly used term by Francophones.&quot;

The (Superior Council of the French language) is an advisory body whose mission is &quot;to advise the Minister responsible for the application of the &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot; on any question relative to the French language in Quebec&quot;. It works in close collaboration with equivalent bodies in France, Belgium and Switzerland.

==Legal dispute==
Language in Canada is defined federally by the &quot;Official Languages Act&quot; since 1969 and is part of the &quot;Constitution of Canada&quot; since 1982. Parts of the Charter have been amended in response to rulings by Quebec Courts which were upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada.

Before 1982, the only part of the &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot; that could be challenged constitutionally was that of the language of legislation and the courts. It was challenged in 1979 by Peter Blaikie, Roland Durand and Yoine Goldstein (&quot;Attorney General of Quebec v. Blaikie&quot;).

In 1982, the patriation of the Canadian Constitution occurred as the British Parliament passed the &quot;Canada Act 1982&quot;. This act enacted the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot; for Canada (including the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms); section 23 introduced the notion of &quot;minority-language education rights&quot;. This opened another door to a constitutional dispute of the Charter.

Alliance Quebec, an anglophone rights lobby group, was founded in May 1982 and operated until 2005. It was mainly through this civil association that a number of lawyers have challenged the constitutionality of Quebec&#x27;s territorial language policy.

A judge temporarily suspended two articles of Bill 96. The articles mandated companies to pay for the translation into French of legal documentation. Quebec Superior Court Justice Chantal Corriveau decided that requiring companies to pay for certified translation might delay some anglophone bodies from the right to access justice.

== Timeline of amendments ==

=== 1988 and 1993 amendments (Bills 178 and 86) ===
Bill 178 was passed in direct response to the legal case of &quot;Ford v. Quebec (Attorney General)&quot; and invoked the notwithstanding clause to shield the articles on business signage from judicial review. Because the law could not be challenged in Canadian courts due the invocation of the notwithstanding clause, a group of English-rights activists instead filled a claim at the United Nations Human Rights Committee in 1989: in &quot;Ballantyne v Canada,&quot; the Quebec language law was found to have violated the rights of the complainants. In response, the Quebec Liberals introduced Bill 86 which made the &quot;Charter&quot; compliant with the Canadian court rulings without the need for the override provisions.

=== Proposed 2013 amendments (Bill 14) ===
In 2013 Diane De Courcy, the Minister responsible for the &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot; under Premier Pauline Marois of the Parti Québécois introduced Bill 14, &quot;An&quot; &quot;Act to Amend the Charter of the French Language, the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms and Other Legislative Provisions&quot;. The bill would have made changes to both the &quot;Charter of the French Language&quot; and the &quot;Charter of Rights of Quebec&quot;.

Marois eventually withdrew the legislation in the face of criticism from Anglophone and Allophone Quebecers and the Quebec Liberal Party, and shifted focus to the &quot;Charter of Quebec Values&quot;. However, most of the details formed basis of the 2021 amendments.

=== 2021 amendments (Bill 96) ===
On August 26, 2020, Quebec&#x27;s Minister of Justice and French Language, Simon Jolin-Barrette, announced plans for 2021 that would strengthen the &quot;Charter&quot;.

On May 12, 2021, the CAQ government of François Legault announced Bill 96, which strengthened the charter.

Bill 96 invoked the notwithstanding clause, allowing the law to temporarily override sections 2 and 7–15 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. The invocation expires five years after its use, or earlier if legislation is passed to repeal it sooner. At the point it expires, it may be renewed again by the Quebec National Assembly. 

Some of the proposed measures were.
* Adding clauses to the Canadian Constitution, saying Quebec is a nation and that its official and common language is French.
* Forcing all commercial signage that includes non-French trademarks to include a &quot;predominant&quot; amount of French on all signs.
* Removing a municipality&#x27;s bilingual status if census data shows that English is the first language for less than 50 per cent of its population, unless the municipality decides to maintain its status by passing a resolution to keep it.
* Creating the French Language Ministry and the position of French-Language Commissioner, as well as bolstering the role of the OQLF. 
* Giving access to French training for those who are not obligated by law to go to school in French.
* Applying the charter to businesses with 25−49 employees and federal workplaces.

The leader of the Parti Québécois, Paul St-Pierre Plamondon, said he supported aspects of the bill, but felt it did not go far enough, saying, &quot;Unfortunately, the CAQ gave us the absolute minimum.&quot; A few days later PQ announced their plan if elected, which would include 
* cutting off funding to companies that do not respect their obligations when it comes to using French 
* subjecting CEGEPs to the charter, imposing a uniform French exam on English-speaking CEGEP students
* lowering immigration thresholds.

According to a poll by Léger published on May 22, among Francophones the approval rate for the various proposals was fluctuating between 72% and 95%.

Protests against the bill included &quot;several thousand&quot; people in Montreal and Indigenous youth.

Bill 96 was adopted on May 24, 2022, with 78 MNAs in favour (from the CAQ and Québec solidaire) and 29 against (from the Liberal Party and Parti Québécois). It received royal assent from Lieutenant Governor J. Michel Doyon on June 1, and subsequently became law.

==Criticism==
The Charter was criticised by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, who called Bourassa&#x27;s Bill 22 as a &quot;slap in the face&quot;, in his memoirs, as he saw it as contrary to the federal government&#x27;s initiative to mandate bilingualism. Except for New Brunswick, most other provinces that accepted Trudeau&#x27;s bilingualism initiative never fully implemented it. The most notable case was Ontario, where Premier Bill Davis did not grant full official status to the French language, despite the fact that the infrastructure was already in place.

Political opposition to the Charter and earlier such language legislation has had limited success, given the support of the laws by the Parti Québécois and Quebec Liberal Party. Legislative initiatives prior to Bill 101 such as &quot;An Act to promote the French language in Quebec&quot; (Bill 63) were often perceived by francophones as insufficient. After Bourassa passed the &quot;Official Language Act&quot;, opponents turned their support to the Union Nationale in the 1976 election, but despite that short resurgence of support, the party collapsed in the subsequent election. Court challenges have been more successful: Many of the key provisions of the initial language legislation having been rewritten to comply with rulings. Despite compliance since 1993 of the Charter with the Canadian Constitution, opposition to the Charter and the government body enforcing it has continued.

According to Statistics Canada, up to 244,000 English-speaking people have emigrated from Quebec to other provinces since the 1970s; those in Quebec whose sole native language was English dropped from 789,000 in 1971 to 575,555 in 2006 when they accounted for 7.6% of the population. Altogether, in 2006, 744,430 (10%) used mostly English as their home language, and 918,955 (12.2%) comprised the Official Language Minority, having English as their First Official language spoken. When many anglophones relocated outside of Quebec after the introduction of the Charter in the 1970s, several English-language schools in Montreal closed their doors. These school closures may also have been brought about by restrictions on who can attend English schools, which has been another ongoing drain on the English school system. Of the Anglophones between 25 and 44 years old who left the province between 1981 and 1986, 15,000 individuals, which was half of this group, had university degrees. The province&#x27;s unemployment rate rose from 8.7 per cent in 1976 to 10.4 per cent in 1977, remaining above 10 per cent for 19 of the last 23 years of the 20th century. The language barrier has also been regarded as a &quot;soft cap&quot; for population growth; for instance from 2013 to 2014 while Montreal gained around 43,000 immigrants from other parts of the world it lost 10,000 residents to other provinces.

Many companies, most notably Sun Life, Royal Bank and Bank of Montreal (which even considered removing &quot;Montreal&quot; from its name), moved their major operations to Toronto as a consequence of the adoption of the Charter. This concerted fleeing of business and subsequent loss of thousands of jobs is believed to have hindered Quebec&#x27;s economy and allowed Toronto to overtake Montreal as Canada&#x27;s business centre. On the other hand, Toronto&#x27;s advantage had been growing since the 1930s and had become apparent in the 1950s, and is also related to the greater importance of the United States, rather than Britain, in Canada&#x27;s economy. This action may have simply accelerated, rather than allowed, this change of status between the two cities.

Levying fines of up to per offence, Charter enforcers were widely labelled in the English media as the &quot;language police&quot; or &quot;tongue troopers&quot;. While the (OQLF) provides several warnings before resorting to legal sanctions, allegations that it has abused its powers has led to charges of racism and harassment. The OQLF took action against stores retailing imported kosher goods that did not meet its labelling requirements, an action perceived in the Jewish community as an unfair targeting that coincided with a high-profile case against the well-known Schwartz&#x27;s delicatessen, the owner of which was subjected to failed legal action by the OQLF due to the apostrophe in his sign, which remains. In the mid-1980s, another delicatessen Dunn&#x27;s got in trouble for having the English word, &quot;Smoked Meat&quot; on the sign out front. The manager at the time stated that Parti Québécois MNA Gérald Godin himself ordered the sandwich by its name. Dunn&#x27;s also fought a ruling to change the name of &quot;Smoked Meat&quot; to &quot;Boeuf Mariné&quot; in order to conform to Quebec Language Law. They won the ruling by appeal by proving that if they didn&#x27;t advertise &quot;Smoked Meat&quot; they would confuse and anger customers. Due to the work of Myer Dunn, under the new ruling, enacted in 1987, Smoked meat became a word in both Official languages of Canada. In 2002, there were reported cases of harassment of allophone merchants who refused to speak French.

The 2004 annual report of the OQLF was criticized by a columnist of &quot;The Gazette&quot; who alleged that there was a &quot;totalitarian mindset in the bureaucracy&quot;. The columnist complained of sections of the report which described the continued prevalence of languages other than French in two-thirds of Montreal&#x27;s households as an &quot;alarming&quot; trend that would present a formidable challenge to francophones in Montreal. In reality, the report judged alarming the fact that adoption of English as a home language by allophones grew faster than the adoption of French as a home language.

The use of the notwithstanding clause in the 1990s to circumvent the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms with regards to signage also resulted in reactions from other Canadian provinces; the was a series of symbolic but divisive resolutions by some municipalities outside Quebec declaring their towns unilingually English in protest of what they saw as an infringement on the rights embodied in the charter. It is often believed that the controversy over the Charter was what influenced the Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord to fail. The Supreme Court in their ruling regarding the signs case which led to the use of the notwithstanding clause, ruled that in fact any sign law was a violation of the freedom of expression right.

Aside from the civil rights infringement, the Charter has faced legal challenges because the restricted education opportunities have hindered not only unilingual but bilingual anglophones&#x27; employment. Although the Charter made French the official language of government and civil administration, the same cannot be said of the private sector. Despite over 40 years of the Charter, it has never been applied as rigorously as intended because to do so would violate civil liberties. English is still often made a requirement by employers in Montreal, including many French-Canadian owned ones, and, to a lesser extent, in Gatineau and Quebec City, with the workforce in Montreal remaining largely bilingual.

On November 14, 1988, the political and human rights organization Freedom House published &quot;The Doctrine of &#x27;Preponderance of Blood&#x27; in South Africa, the Soviet Union and Quebec&quot; in its journal &quot;Exchange&quot;. Introduced by Zbigniew Brzezinski (an anglophone who had once lived in Montreal) former U.S. President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s National Security adviser, the essay compared the language of instruction provisions of the charter with South African apartheid statutes and jurisprudence. However, the Supreme Court of Canada disagreed with the discrimination-based-on-ancestry argument under the &quot;Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms&quot; in &quot;Gosselin (Tutor of) v. Quebec (Attorney General)&quot;, believing that it conflicted with section 23 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. The criteria used by Quebec to determine if parents are entitled to have their children instructed in English are the same as those found under section 23 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;.

==Influence abroad==
The 2001 report of the Estates-General on the Situation and Future of the French Language in Quebec identified the negative perception of Quebec&#x27;s language policy in the rest of Canada and the United States as a problem to solve. It stated:

In Canada and abroad, the linguistic policy of Quebec is too often negatively perceived. The business community and the media, in particular, know it very little. For their part, the Americans remain opposed to legislation that appears to them to reduce individual liberties and limit the use of English. For them, language and culture are two separate elements, they do not see how the protection of Quebec culture also includes the protection of the French language, even though 35 American States have adopted declarations proclaiming English the official language. Thus, must be developed the perception that Quebec culture is a part of the North-American heritage and that it is necessary to preserve it. It is also important to correct the erroneous perceptions regarding the Quebec language policy and its application. 

Recommendation 147 of the report suggested the creation of an institutional television and radio campaign targeting both Quebec citizens and certain groups abroad to inform on the state of French in North America and the language policy of Quebec. Recommendation 148 suggested the creation of a watchdog to correct errors made &quot;both in good faith and bad faith&quot; in the media.

As part of the effort to improve how its policies are perceived, the OQLF conducted an inquiry on the influence of Quebec&#x27;s language policy abroad in countries where the fragility of certain languages prompted the use of legislative measures. It requested and published the opinions of various experts from Spain, Israel, the United States, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, Wales, Australia and Flanders in a special issue of the OQLF&#x27;s celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Charter in 2002.

Jonas Žilinskas, a lecturer at University of Šiauliai in Lithuania described the state of the Lithuanian language after a prolonged Russian rule over his country:

One proclaimed a policy of bilingualism which was expressed only by the obligation made to Lithuanians to learn Russian while Russians did not bother to learn Lithuanian. If the written Lithuanian language were more or less protected by writers through newspapers and publishers, the spoken Lithuanian language was degraded. Often, in the institutions, it was only a language of oral communication, the greatest part of technical documentation and correspondence being written in Russian.

This &quot;false bilingualism&quot; was followed by the Sąjūdis movement, during which the government of Lithuania declared their language the sole official language and began working on a language policy modelled on the experience of Quebec.

Mart Rannut, vice-dean of research at the Department of Philology of the University of Tallinn, in Estonia, recalled the influence of Quebec&#x27;s expertise in the field of linguistic human rights and language planning which helped countries that have gained independence from the Soviet Union and concluded that &quot;Bill 101 indirectly touched one-sixth of the planet&quot;.

Ina Druviete, at the time dean of the department of sociolinguistics at the Linguistic Institute of Latvia, noted the similarities between the language policies in all three Baltic states (which have large, if often officially unrecognized, Russophone minorities) and that of Quebec. All policies aiming &quot;to prevent language shifts and to modify the hierarchy of languages in the public life. The principal sectors of intervention were the language used in the government agencies and the administration, in meetings and office spaces in particular, in corporate names, information and education. The principle of territorial linguistic rights was instituted.&quot;

In Wales, the language policy of Quebec had a great influence, but a similar policy could not be implemented as it was in the Baltic States, because Welsh speakers do not form a majority in this constituent country of the United Kingdom. According to Colin H. Williams, professor and researcher at the Welsh Department of Cardiff University particular lessons followed in Wales which stem from the experience of Quebec are:

* The acquisition of detailed census data and explanatory facts aiming at clarifying the public discussion 
* The linguistic legislation (official language status, right to speak Welsh before the court, Welsh Language Board responsible to administer the law) 
* The iconography of the linguistic landscape
* The progress in the teaching of the Welsh language

In Israel, while the &quot;penetration of English in the sociolinguistic organization of the country&quot; is perceived, according to Bernard Spolsky, professor emeritus of English at the Bar-Ilan University, as a threat to Hebrew, the language policy has thus far only influenced linguists and some politicians. He writes:

Periodically, Israeli politicians present bills to proclaim Hebrew the sole official language of the country. Presently, Hebrew shares this title with Arabic only, because a measure was taken soon after the foundation of the State, in 1948, to modify the British policy, which imposed three languages, and gave up English. The last attempt at giving a judicial protection to Hebrew goes back to December 2000: two bills were then rejected.
In Catalonia, according to Miquel Reniu i Tresserras, president of the and former chief executive officer of the Catalan language policy, Quebec&#x27;s legislation constituted a &quot;reference model&quot; and the OQLF and the equivalent body in Catalonia were in close collaboration.

<doc id="357632" wikidata="Q228395" url="?curid=357632" title="Mating">
<text>In biology, mating is the pairing of either opposite-sex or hermaphroditic organisms for the purposes of sexual reproduction. &quot;Fertilization&quot; is the fusion of two gametes. &quot;Copulation&quot; is the union of the sex organs of two sexually reproducing animals for insemination and subsequent internal fertilization. Mating may also lead to external fertilization, as seen in amphibians, fishes and plants. For most species, mating is between two individuals of opposite sexes. However, for some hermaphroditic species, copulation is not required because the parent organism is capable of self-fertilization (autogamy); for example, banana slugs.

The term &quot;mating&quot; is also applied to related processes in bacteria, archaea and viruses. Mating in these cases involves the pairing of individuals, accompanied by the pairing of their homologous chromosomes and then exchange of genomic information leading to formation of recombinant progeny (see mating systems).

==Animals==

For animals, mating strategies include random mating, disassortative mating, assortative mating, or a mating pool. In some birds, it includes behaviors such as nest-building and feeding offspring. The human practice of mating and artificially inseminating domesticated animals is part of animal husbandry.

In some terrestrial arthropods, including insects representing basal (primitive) phylogenetic clades, the male deposits spermatozoa on the substrate, sometimes stored within a special structure. Courtship involves inducing the female to take up the sperm package into her genital opening without actual copulation. Courtship is often facilitated through forming groups, called leks, in flies and many other insects. For example, male &quot;Tokunagayusurika akamusi&quot; forms swarms dancing in the air to attract females. In groups such as dragonflies and many spiders, males extrude sperm into secondary copulatory structures removed from their genital opening, which are then used to inseminate the female (in dragonflies, it is a set of modified sternites on the second abdominal segment; in spiders, it is the male pedipalps). In advanced groups of insects, the male uses its aedeagus, a structure formed from the terminal segments of the abdomen, to deposit sperm directly (though sometimes in a capsule called a &quot;spermatophore&quot;) into the female&#x27;s reproductive tract.

Other animals reproduce sexually with external fertilization, including many basal vertebrates. Vertebrates reproduce with internal fertilization through cloacal copulation (in reptiles, some fish, and most birds) or penile-vaginal penetration and ejaculation of semen (in mammals).

In domesticated animals, there are various type of mating methods being employed to mate animals like pen mating (when female is moved to the desired male into a pen) or paddock mating (where one male is let loose in the paddock with several females).

==Plants and fungi==
Like in animals, mating in other Eukaryotes, such as plants and fungi, denotes . However, in vascular plants this is mostly achieved without physical contact between mating individuals (see pollination), and in some cases, e.g., in fungi no distinguishable male or female organs exist (see isogamy); however, mating types in some fungal species are somewhat analogous to sexual dimorphism in animals, and determine whether or not two individual isolates can mate. &quot;Yeasts&quot; are eukaryotic microorganisms classified in the kingdom Fungi, with 1,500 species currently described. In general, under high stress conditions like nutrient starvation, haploid cells will die; under the same conditions, however, diploid cells of &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; can undergo sporulation, entering sexual reproduction (meiosis) and produce a variety of haploid spores, which can go on to mate (conjugate) and reform the diploid.

==Protists==

Protists are a large group of diverse eukaryotic microorganisms, mainly unicellular animals and plants, that do not form tissues. The earliest eukaryotes were likely protists. Mating and sexual reproduction are widespread among extant eukaryotes including protists such as &quot;Paramecium&quot; and &quot;Chlamydomonas&quot;. In many eukaryotic species, mating is promoted by sex pheromones including the protist &quot;Blepharisma japonicum.&quot; Based on a phylogenetic analysis, Dacks and Roger proposed that facultative sex was present in the common ancestor of all eukaryotes.

However, to many biologists it seemed unlikely until recently, that mating and sex could be a primordial and fundamental characteristic of eukaryotes. A principal reason for this view was that mating and sex appeared to be lacking in certain pathogenic protists whose ancestors branched off early from the eukaryotic family tree. However, several of these protists are now known to be capable of, or to recently have had, the capability for meiosis and hence mating. To cite one example, the common intestinal parasite &quot;Giardia intestinalis&quot; was once considered to be a descendant of a protist lineage that predated the emergence of meiosis and sex. However, &quot;G. intestinalis&quot; was recently found to have a core set of genes that function in meiosis and that are widely present among sexual eukaryotes. These results suggested that &quot;G. intestinalis&quot; is capable of meiosis and thus mating and sexual reproduction. Furthermore, direct evidence for meiotic recombination, indicative of mating and sexual reproduction, was also found in &quot;G. intestinalis&quot;. Other protists for which evidence of mating and sexual reproduction has recently been described are parasitic protozoa of the genus &quot;Leishmania&quot;, &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot;, and acanthamoeba.

Protists generally reproduce asexually under favorable environmental conditions, but tend to reproduce sexually under stressful conditions, such as starvation or heat shock.

<text>Room on Fire is the second studio album by American rock band the Strokes, released on October 21, 2003, through RCA Records. Its title is derived from a lyric in the song &quot;Reptilia&quot;. The album received positive reviews upon its release and reached number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, where it went on to sell 597,000 units by October 2006, earning a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It also reached number two on the UK Albums Chart. Three singles were released from the album: &quot;12:51&quot;, &quot;Reptilia&quot;, and &quot;The End Has No End&quot;.

==Recording==
Immediately after touring for their debut album &quot;Is This It&quot;, the Strokes returned to the studio. They hired Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, but fired him when, according to the band, their work together proved &quot;soulless&quot;. Godrich said of the failed collaboration: &quot;The problem there was that me and [singer Julian Casablancas] are just too similar, we&#x27;re both control freaks. He wanted to do it his way, I wanted to do it my way, and obviously that&#x27;s the point of me being there. And I&#x27;m saying &#x27;Well, why am I here if you&#x27;re not prepared to try and do it the way I want to do it?&#x27; We got on great, it was just one of those laughable things where it just doesn&#x27;t work. I wanted them to change, and they didn&#x27;t.&quot;

Those sessions were ultimately scrapped and the band returned to their original producer, Gordon Raphael. The Strokes had exactly only three months of studio time to record the album. Guitarist Nick Valensi stated that &quot;the album would&#x27;ve ended up a lot better if we&#x27;d had another couple of weeks.&quot;

==Critical reception==

&quot;Room On Fire&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics: on the review aggregating website Metacritic, it currently has a score of 77 out of 100 based on 31 reviews, which indicates &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. However, in general, reviewers found the album too similar to &quot;Is This It&quot;. Rob Mitchum of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave the album an 8 out of 10, but stated that the band &quot;have all but given birth to an identical twin.&quot; A positive review from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said that &quot;the Strokes have resisted the temptation to hit the brakes, grow up and screw around with a sound that doesn&#x27;t need fixing — yet.&quot; The review also stated that &quot;if you want comfort and clarity, you&#x27;re definitely in the wrong room. This record was built for thrills and speed.&quot; Dan Tallis of BBC Music gave it a favorable review and said, &quot;Bands should think themselves lucky to achieve such heights just once in their careers. However, they&#x27;ve done all they could have done. They&#x27;ve made &quot;Is This It&quot; part two. It&#x27;s more of the same plus extras. And I&#x27;m more than happy to settle for that.&quot;

Ben Thompson of &quot;The Observer&quot; gave it all five stars and said, &quot;This is a feeling that can be inspired only by people making the absolute most of an opportunity to communicate: cutting through all the rubbish that surrounds them to make a clear and memorable artistic statement. And that the Strokes should have managed to do such a thing at this stage in their careers, is - I think - an achievement of real significance.&quot; Greg Milner of &quot;Spin&quot; gave it a score of eight out of ten and said that its &quot;similarity to its predecessor ultimately bespeaks a purity of vision, not a dearth of new ideas.&quot; Jenny Tatone of Neumu gave it a score of nine stars out of ten and said, &quot;The Strokes don&#x27;t make the most original sounding music you&#x27;ve ever heard, but they make something that is only the Strokes.&quot; In his Consumer Guide, Robert Christgau gave the album a three-star honorable mention () while picking out two songs from the album (&quot;Between Love and Hate&quot; and &quot;What Ever Happened?&quot;) and stating simply, &quot;Narcissism repeats itself.&quot;

Not all reviews were positive, however. Raoul Hernandez of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; gave the album a score of two stars out of five and stated that &quot;even the half-hearted retreads... cashing in on the notoriously unwashed NYC quintet&#x27;s debut can&#x27;t muster a wink.&quot; Iain Moffat of Playlouder gave the album only one star and said of the Strokes, &quot;There&#x27;s little of the pop sparkle that shone through the likes of &#x27;The Modern Age&#x27; and &#x27;Last Nite&#x27; even when - as with &#x27;You Talk Way Too Much&#x27; - they&#x27;re rewriting old material, and Julian&#x27;s vocals are, to be blunt, awful, sounding uncomfortable to record and rather complacently nasal.&quot;

In 2013, &quot;Room On Fire&quot; was listed at number 360 on &quot;NME&quot;″s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In 2018, the BBC included it in their list of &quot;the acclaimed albums that nobody listens to any more&quot;.

=== Reappraisal ===
In 2021, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; included &quot;Room on Fire&quot; on its list of album review scores they &quot;would change if they could&quot;, upgrading its score from 8.0 to 9.2 out of 10, though they stated this would not change the actual score. Lane Brown of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; praised it as a &quot;different, better album with major improvements over its predecessor&quot;. Scoring a 0.1 bonus point more than &quot;Is This It&quot;, &quot;Room on Fire&quot; is commended in marking confident progress and &quot;at least partially thwarting rock history&#x27;s most inevitable backlash.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
The album peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the US, and was later certified Gold by the RIAA in December 2003, and platinum certification for selling over one million units in June 2021.

<text>A pay-as-you-earn tax (PAYE), or pay-as-you-go (PAYG) in Australia, is a withholding of taxes on income payments to employees. Amounts withheld are treated as advance payments of income tax due. They are refundable to the extent they exceed tax as determined on tax returns. PAYE may include withholding the employee portion of insurance contributions or similar social benefit taxes. In most countries, they are determined by employers but subject to government review. PAYE is deducted from each paycheck by the employer and must be remitted promptly to the government. Most countries refer to income tax withholding by other terms, including pay-as-you-go tax.

==United Kingdom==

=== Origins ===
Devised by Sir Paul Chambers, PAYE was introduced into the UK in 1944, following trials in 1940–1941. As with many of the United Kingdom&#x27;s institutional arrangements, the way in which the state collects income tax through PAYE owes much of its form and structure to the peculiarities of the era in which it was devised. The financial strain that the Second World War placed upon the country meant that the Treasury needed to collect more tax from many more people. This posed significant challenges to the government and to the many workers and employers who had previously never come into contact with the tax system.

===Nature===
PAYE is applied to sick pay, maternity pay, directors&#x27; fees and pensions (but not the state pension, although it remains taxable), as well as wages and salaries. Each person has a tax code which is used to reflect any allowances, along with other taxable income (including the state pension). This means that the PAYE system typically results in the correct amount of tax being paid on all the taxable income of a taxpayer, making a tax return unnecessary. However, if the taxpayer&#x27;s affairs are complicated, a tax return may be required to determine the amount of tax payable or refundable.

===Reporting===
The employer is responsible for sending the Income Tax on to HMRC each month, along with various other employment taxes. The amounts deducted from each payment to individual employees must be reported using an electronic submission on or before the day payment is made.

==Ireland==

PAYE in Ireland includes deduction of income tax and PRSI (Pay Related Social Insurance) by employers from payments to employees. The amount is determined by employers based on a Certificate of Tax Credits and Standard Rate (Certificate) provided by Ireland Revenue (Revenue). 

PAYE applies to earnings of all kinds arising from your employment, including bonuses, overtime and non-cash payments known as &quot;benefits in kind&quot; such as the use of a company car.

===Forms and reporting===
Employees must apply to Revenue for the certificate by submitting Form 12A to Revenue. A certificate is issued at the beginning of each tax year based on the employee&#x27;s personal circumstances. At the end of each tax year, the employer must give the employee a certificate of Pay, Tax and PRSI deducted during the year, Form P60.

A Form P45 is a certificate given by an employer to an employee on cessation of employment. This form certifies the employee&#x27;s pay, tax and PRSI contributions from the start of the tax year to date of cessation and also certifies that the deductions have been made in accordance with the instructions given by Revenue.

If the PAYE is not the same as tax that would be due for the year, the employee must file Form 12, an annual tax return.

==New Zealand==
PAYE is deducted by employers from employees&#x27; salary or wages in New Zealand, and paid to the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) on their behalf. It includes income tax and ACC earners&#x27; levy. PAYE is calculated by employers based on tax codes provided by the employee and tables provided by the IRD. Employees may calculate their expected tax and tax code using the PAYE calculator.

===Forms and reporting===
Employees must provide their employer with a completed IR330 Tax code declaration form, advising their employer of their IRD number (which is one&#x27;s identification number with the IRD) and the appropriate tax code for which to deduct in tax, and if required, student loan repayments. If an employer does not receive a correctly completed IR330, the employer may deduct tax at the &quot;no-notification rate&quot; of 45%.

Employers use either the IR340 (weekly/fortnightly) or IR341 (four-weekly/monthly) PAYE deduction tables to determine the appropriate amounts to deduct from an employee&#x27;s wages. Every month, an employer must file a complete IR348 Employer monthly schedule with the IRD, stating the income and deductions of each employee. Tax withheld must be paid to the IRD monthly or semi-monthly, accompanied (or sent separately in the case of electronic payment) with a completed IR345 Employer deductions form.

==Australia==

The Australian Taxation Office (ATO) administers a pay-as-you-go tax (PAYG) withholding system. Introduced in 1999, it merged 11 previous payment and reporting systems, one of which was a &quot;PAYE&quot; system for employee income, from which the name &quot;PAYG&quot; distinguishes. Employers must calculate the amount of income tax to withhold based on ATO tables, based on employee declarations. These arrangements cover payments from employment as well as under the Prescribed Payments system and the Reportable Payments system. The PAYG system involves regular payments made by employers and other payers, for example, superannuation funds. It is used to collect by instalments income tax, HELP repayments, Medicare and other payments. PAYG amounts to be withheld are determined based on the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) PAYG schedules. Discrepancies and deduction amounts are declared in the annual income tax return and will be part of the refund that follows after annual assessment or reduce the tax debt that may be payable after assessment.

For an employee&#x27;s primary job, the withholding tax rate is lower because of the existence of a tax-free threshold in Australia. All other work has tax withheld based on a rate that excludes the tax-free threshold.

===PAYG summaries===
Each employee who receives PAYG-type payments during a financial year would receive a PAYG payment summary from their employer at the end of the financial year - commonly known as the Group Certificate. The PAYG payment summary will include:

* the employee&#x27;s details including the Tax File Number (TFN)
* the gross income earned by the employee from that payer
* the total PAYG amount withheld by the payer
* the payer&#x27;s Australian Business Number or withholding payer number (WPN).

The information on the PAYG payment summary is needed to enable the employee to complete his or her income tax return.

The payer must send to the ATO a copy of the PAYG payment summaries as well as an annual PAYG summary. This may be sent to the ATO electronically using Standard Business Reporting enabled software, or it may be sent as a hard copy by mail. The total of the wages paid reported on the PAYG summary and the total amount withheld must agree with the totals as reported by the payer to the ATO on the Business Activity Statements (BASs) for the year. The ATO will use the information on the PAYG payment summary to match with the employee, using the employee&#x27;s TFN.

==Barbados==
The PAYE tax system was introduced in Barbados in 1957 which allowed employees to have their income tax be paid on the behalf of their employers by deducting the amount from their wage/salary. Every employer who has employees earning more than $481 per week or $2,083 per month is required to register as an employer with the Barbados Revenue Authority (BRA) in either 12 month or 52 weekly installments.
===Forms and reporting===
PAYE can be calculated via a provided PAYE Tax Calculator form on the BRA website. Employers must receive the employees&#x27; 13 digit Tax Identification Number (TIN) and register them via a provided A47: 001 Employee Declaration Form along with a A47.004 PAYE Tax Deduction Remittance Form where after they must pay the employees&#x27; taxes to the Revenue Commissioner on or before the 15th of the month following the month in which it was deducted. There is also a provided Tax Tables Booklet that assists employers with instructions on how to correctly calculate and pay an employee&#x27;s income tax.
==Similar systems==
Several other countries operate systems similar to PAYE that may be referred to as withholding tax or deduction of tax at source. See the articles listed below.

===Canada===
Canada requires tax deduction at source on payments of compensation by employers. The deduction is required for federal and provincial income taxes, Canada Pension Plan contributions, and Employment Insurance.

===France===
Initially set to start in 2018, France introduced a pay-as-you-earn scheme for the collection of its state income tax (&quot;impôt sur le revenu&quot;) in January 2019. To accommodate the progressivity of the French tax system, which considers the total income and composition of the household to set the tax rate of individuals, while preserving the privacy of employees to their employers, the administration only transmits to companies the individual tax rate to retain on their employees&#x27; paychecks, along with other payroll withholding, such as social security contributions.

===Morocco===
Employers are required to withhold income tax on salary paid to employees. The tax must be paid to the government during the month following the withholding.

===Germany===
In Germany employers are required to pay salary tax (Lohnsteuer) for their employees which is an advance payment on the income tax. The employer is liable for the salary tax but the employee has to pay it. In most situations it is not mandatory to file taxes as the salary tax can cover the whole income tax. Unemployment aid, short time work aid or other sources of income like a business or a rental object require people in Germany to file taxes. 

===United States===

Withholding of income, Social Security and Medicare taxes is required in the United States. The plan was developed by Beardsley Ruml, Bernard Baruch, and Milton Friedman in 1942. The government forgave taxes due March 15, 1942, for tax year 1941, and started withholding from paychecks. Income tax withholding applies to federal and state income taxes. In addition, certain states impose other levies required to be withheld.

In the United States, the term &quot;pay-as-you-earn&quot; and PAYE typically refer to Income-based repayment of loans, not taxation. However, an IRS article published March 29, 2022 updates and reviews the policy as pay-as-you-go, or else you may be penalized for not paying estimated taxes if you owe more than $1,000 after taxes are withheld.

<doc id="357636" wikidata="Q1705284" url="?curid=357636" title="Flight control surfaces">
<text>Aircraft flight control surfaces are aerodynamic devices allowing a pilot to adjust and control the aircraft&#x27;s flight attitude.

Development of an effective set of flight control surfaces was a critical advance in the development of aircraft. Early efforts at fixed-wing aircraft design succeeded in generating sufficient lift to get the aircraft off the ground, but once aloft, the aircraft proved uncontrollable, often with disastrous results. The development of effective flight controls is what allowed stable flight.

This article describes the control surfaces used on a fixed-wing aircraft of conventional design. Other fixed-wing aircraft configurations may use different control surfaces but the basic principles remain. The controls (stick and rudder) for rotary wing aircraft (helicopter or autogyro) accomplish the same motions about the three axes of rotation, but manipulate the rotating flight controls (main rotor disk and tail rotor disk) in a completely different manner.

Flight control surfaces are operated by aircraft flight control systems.

Considered as a generalized fluid control surface, rudders, in particular, are shared between aircraft and watercraft. 

==Development ==

The Wright brothers are credited with developing the first practical control surfaces. It is a main part of their patent on flying. Unlike modern control surfaces, they used wing warping. In an attempt to circumvent the Wright patent, Glenn Curtiss made hinged control surfaces, the same type of concept first patented some four decades earlier in the United Kingdom. Hinged control surfaces have the advantage of not causing stresses that are a problem of wing warping and are easier to build into structures.

===Axes of motion===

An aircraft is free to rotate around three axes that are perpendicular to each other and intersect at its center of gravity (CG). To control position and direction a pilot must be able to control rotation about each of them.

===Transverse axis===
The &quot;transverse axis&quot;, also known as &quot;lateral axis&quot;, passes through an aircraft from wingtip to wingtip. Rotation about this axis is called &quot;pitch&quot;. Pitch changes the vertical direction that the aircraft&#x27;s nose is pointing. The elevators are the primary control surfaces for pitch.

===Longitudinal axis===
The longitudinal axis passes through the aircraft from nose to tail. Rotation about this axis is called &quot;roll&quot;. The angular displacement about this axis is called bank. The pilot changes bank angle by increasing the lift on one wing and decreasing it on the other. This differential lift causes rotation around the longitudinal axis. The ailerons are the primary control of bank, especially on smaller aircraft: larger aircraft often use roll spoilers or spoilerons on the upper wing surface to reduce lift on one wing to aid rolling. The rudder also has a secondary effect on bank through moving one wing forward and the other backwards, affecting the lift they produce.

===Vertical axis===
The vertical axis passes through an aircraft from top to bottom. Rotation about this axis is called &quot;yaw&quot;. Yaw changes the direction the aircraft&#x27;s nose is pointing, left or right. The primary control of yaw is with the rudder. Ailerons also have a secondary effect on yaw as the wing with more lift experiences more drag.

These axes move with the aircraft and change relative to the earth as the aircraft moves. For example, for an aircraft whose left wing is pointing straight down, its &quot;vertical&quot; axis is parallel with the ground, while its &quot;transverse&quot; axis is perpendicular to the ground.

==Main control surfaces==
The main control surfaces of a fixed-wing aircraft are attached to the airframe on hinges or tracks so they may move and thus deflect the air stream passing over them. This redirection of the air stream generates an unbalanced force to rotate the plane about the associated axis.
===Ailerons===
Ailerons are mounted on the trailing edge of each wing near the wingtips and move in opposite directions. When the pilot moves the aileron control to the left, or turns the wheel counter-clockwise, the left aileron goes up and the right aileron goes down. A raised aileron reduces lift on that wing and a lowered one increases lift, so moving the aileron control in this way causes the left wing to drop and the right wing to rise. This causes the aircraft to roll to the left and begin to turn to the left. Centering the control returns the ailerons to the neutral position, maintaining the bank angle. The aircraft will continue to turn until opposite aileron motion returns the bank angle to zero to fly straight.

===Elevator===
The elevator is a moveable part of the horizontal stabilizer, hinged to the back of the fixed part of the horizontal tail. The elevators move up and down together. When the pilot pulls the stick backward, the elevators go up. Pushing the stick forward causes the elevators to go down. Raised elevators push down on the tail and cause the nose to pitch up. This makes the wings fly at a higher angle of attack, which generates more lift and more drag. Centering the stick returns the elevators to neutral and stops the change of pitch. Some aircraft, such as an MD-80, use a servo tab within the elevator surface to aerodynamically move the main surface into position. The direction of travel of the control tab will thus be in a direction opposite to the main control surface. It is for this reason that an MD-80 tail looks like it has a &#x27;split&#x27; elevator system.

In the canard arrangement, the elevators are hinged to the rear of a foreplane and move in the opposite sense, for example when the pilot pulls the stick back the elevators go down to increase the lift at the front and lift the nose up.

===Rudder===
The rudder is typically mounted on the trailing edge of the vertical stabilizer, part of the empennage. When the pilot pushes the left pedal, the rudder deflects left. Pushing the right pedal causes the rudder to deflect right. Deflecting the rudder right pushes the tail left and causes the nose to yaw to the right. Centering the rudder pedals returns the rudder to neutral and stops the yaw.

===Secondary effects of controls===

====Ailerons====

The ailerons primarily cause roll. Whenever lift is increased, induced drag is also increased so when the aileron control is moved to roll the aircraft to the left, the right aileron is lowered which increases lift on the right wing and therefore increases induced drag on the right wing. Using ailerons causes adverse yaw, meaning the nose of the aircraft yaws in a direction opposite to the aileron application. When moving the aileron control to bank the wings to the left, adverse yaw moves the nose of the aircraft to the &quot;right&quot;. Adverse yaw is most pronounced in low-speed aircraft with long wings, such as gliders. It is counteracted by the pilot using the rudder pedals. Differential ailerons are ailerons which have been rigged such that the downgoing aileron deflects less than the upward-moving one, causing less adverse yaw.

====Rudder====
The rudder is a fundamental control surface which is typically controlled by pedals rather than at the stick. It is the primary means of controlling yaw—the rotation of an airplane about its vertical axis. The rudder may also be called upon to counter-act the adverse yaw produced by the roll-control surfaces.

If rudder is continuously applied in level flight the aircraft will yaw initially in the direction of the applied rudder – the primary effect of rudder. After a few seconds the aircraft will tend to bank in the direction of yaw. This arises initially from the increased speed of the wing opposite to the direction of yaw and the reduced speed of the other wing. The faster wing generates more lift and so rises, while the other wing tends to go down because of generating less lift. Continued application of rudder sustains rolling tendency because the aircraft flying at an angle to the airflow - skidding towards the forward wing. When applying right rudder in an aircraft with dihedral the left hand wing will have increased angle of attack and the right hand wing will have decreased angle of attack which will result in a roll to the right. An aircraft with anhedral will show the opposite effect.
This effect of the rudder is commonly used in model aircraft where if sufficient dihedral or polyhedral is included in the wing design, primary roll control such as ailerons may be omitted altogether.

===Turning the aircraft===

Unlike turning a boat, changing the direction of an aircraft normally must be done with the ailerons rather than the rudder. The rudder turns (yaws) the aircraft but has little effect on its direction of travel. With aircraft, the change in direction is caused by the horizontal component of lift, acting on the wings. The pilot tilts the lift force, which is perpendicular to the wings, in the direction of the intended turn by rolling the aircraft into the turn. As the bank angle is increased, the lifting force can be split into two components: one acting vertically and one acting horizontally.

If the total lift is kept constant, the vertical component of lift will decrease. As the weight of the aircraft is unchanged, this would result in the aircraft descending if not countered. To maintain level flight requires increased positive (up) elevator to increase the angle of attack, increase the total lift generated and keep the vertical component of lift equal with the weight of the aircraft. This cannot continue indefinitely. The total load factor required to maintain level flight is directly related to the bank angle. This means that for a given airspeed, level flight can only be maintained up to a certain given angle of bank. Beyond this angle of bank, the aircraft will suffer an accelerated stall if the pilot attempts to generate enough lift to maintain level flight.

===Alternate main control surfaces===

Some aircraft configurations have non-standard primary controls. For example, instead of elevators at the back of the stabilizers, the entire tailplane may change angle. Some aircraft have a tail in the shape of a V, and the moving parts at the back of those combine the functions of elevators and rudder. Delta wing aircraft may have &quot;elevons&quot; at the back of the wing, which combine the functions of elevators and ailerons.

==Secondary control surfaces==
=== Spoilers ===
On low drag aircraft such as sailplanes, spoilers are used to disrupt airflow over the wing and greatly reduce lift. This allows a glider pilot to lose altitude without gaining excessive airspeed. Spoilers are sometimes called &quot;lift dumpers&quot;. Spoilers that can be used asymmetrically are called spoilerons and can affect an aircraft&#x27;s roll.

=== Flaps ===
Flaps are mounted on the trailing edge on the inboard section of each wing (near the wing roots). They are deflected down to increase the effective curvature of the wing. Flaps raise the maximum lift coefficient of the aircraft and therefore reduce its stalling speed. They are used during low speed, high angle of attack flight including take-off and descent for landing. Some aircraft are equipped with &quot;flaperons&quot;, which are more commonly called &quot;inboard ailerons&quot;. These devices function primarily as ailerons, but on some aircraft, will &quot;droop&quot; when the flaps are deployed, thus acting as both a flap and a roll-control inboard aileron.

=== Slats ===
Slats, also known as &quot;leading edge devices&quot;, are extensions to the front of a wing for lift augmentation, and are intended to reduce the stalling speed by altering the airflow over the wing. Slats may be fixed or retractable - fixed slats (e.g. as on the Fieseler Fi 156 Storch) give excellent slow speed and STOL capabilities, but compromise higher speed performance. Retractable slats, as seen on most airliners, provide reduced stalling speed for take-off and landing, but are retracted for cruising.

=== Air brakes ===

Air brakes are used to increase drag. Spoilers might act as air brakes, but are not pure air brakes as they also function as lift-dumpers or in some cases as roll control surfaces. Air brakes are usually surfaces that deflect outwards from the fuselage (in most cases symmetrically on opposing sides) into the airstream in order to increase form-drag. As they are in most cases located elsewhere on the aircraft, they do not directly affect the lift generated by the wing. Their purpose is to slow down the aircraft. They are particularly useful when a high rate of descent is required. They are common on high performance military aircraft as well as civilian aircraft, especially those lacking reverse thrust capability.

==Control trimming surfaces==
Trimming controls allow a pilot to balance the lift and drag being produced by the wings and control surfaces over a wide range of load and airspeed. This reduces the effort required to adjust or maintain a desired flight attitude.

===Elevator trim===

Elevator trim balances the control force necessary to maintain the correct aerodynamic force on the tail to balance the aircraft. Whilst carrying out certain flight exercises, a lot of trim could be required to maintain the desired angle of attack. This mainly applies to slow flight, where a nose-up attitude is required, in turn requiring a lot of trim causing the tailplane to exert a strong downforce. Elevator trim is correlated with the speed of the airflow over the tail, thus airspeed changes to the aircraft require re-trimming. An important design parameter for aircraft is the stability of the aircraft when trimmed for level flight. Any disturbances such as gusts or turbulence will be damped over a short period of time and the aircraft will return to its level flight trimmed airspeed.

====Trimming tail plane====
Except for very light aircraft, trim tabs on the elevators are unable to provide the force and range of motion desired. To provide the appropriate trim force the entire horizontal tail plane is made adjustable in pitch. This allows the pilot to select exactly the right amount of positive or negative lift from the tail plane while reducing drag from the elevators.

====Control horn====

A control horn is a section of control surface which projects ahead of the pivot point. It generates a force which tends to increase the surface&#x27;s deflection thus reducing the control pressure experienced by the pilot. Control horns may also incorporate a counterweight which helps to balance the control and prevent it from fluttering in the airstream. Some designs feature separate anti-flutter weights.

(In radio controlled model aircraft, the term &quot;control horn&quot; has a different meaning)

====Spring trim====
In the simplest arrangement, trimming is done by a mechanical spring (or bungee) which adds appropriate force to augment the pilot&#x27;s control input. The spring is usually connected to an elevator trim lever to allow the pilot to set the spring force applied.

===Rudder and aileron trim===

Most fixed-wing aircraft have a trimming control surface on the elevator, but larger aircraft also have a trim control for the rudder, and another for the ailerons. The rudder trim is to counter any asymmetric thrust from the engines. Aileron trim is to counter the effects of the centre of gravity being displaced from the aircraft centerline. This can be caused by fuel or an item of payload being loaded more on one side of the aircraft compared to the other, such as when one fuel tank has more fuel than the other.

<text>Opera seria (; plural: &quot;opere serie&quot;; usually called &quot;dramma per musica&quot; or &quot;melodramma serio&quot;) is an Italian musical term which refers to the noble and &quot;serious&quot; style of Italian opera that predominated in Europe from the 1710s to about 1770. The term itself was rarely used at the time and only attained common usage once &quot;opera seria&quot; was becoming unfashionable and beginning to be viewed as something of a historical genre. The popular rival to &quot;opera seria&quot; was &quot;opera buffa,&quot; the &#x27;comic&#x27; opera that took its cue from the improvisatory commedia dell&#x27;arte. An opera seria had a historical or Biblical subject, whereas an opera buffa had a contemporary subject.

Italian &quot;opera seria&quot; (invariably to Italian libretti) was produced not only in Italy but almost throughout Europe, and beyond (see Opera in Latin America, Opera in Cuba e. g.). Among the main centres in Europe were the court operas based in Warsaw (since 1628), Munich (founded in 1653), London (established in 1662), Vienna (firmly established 1709; first operatic representation: &quot;Il pomo d&#x27;oro&quot;, 1668), Dresden (since 1719) as well as other German residences, Saint Petersburg (Italian opera reached Russia in 1731, first opera venues followed ), Madrid (see Spanish opera), and Lisbon. &quot;Opera seria&quot; was less popular in France, where the national genre of French opera (or &quot;tragédie en musique&quot;) was preferred.

Acclaimed composers of &quot;opera seria&quot; included Antonio Caldara, Alessandro Scarlatti, George Frideric Handel, Antonio Vivaldi, Tomaso Albinoni, Nicola Porpora, Leonardo Vinci, Johann Adolph Hasse, Leonardo Leo, Baldassare Galuppi, Francesco Feo, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi and in the second half of the 18th century Christoph Willibald Gluck, Niccolò Jommelli, Tommaso Traetta, Josef Mysliveček, Joseph Haydn, Johann Christian Bach, Carl Heinrich Graun, Antonio Salieri, Antonio Sacchini, Giuseppe Sarti, Niccolò Piccinni, Giovanni Paisiello, Domenico Cimarosa, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. By far the most successful librettist of the era was Metastasio, others were Apostolo Zeno, Benedetto Pamphili, Silvio Stampiglia, Antonio Salvi, Pietro Pariati, Pietro Ottoboni, Stefano Benedetto Pallavicino, Nicola Francesco Haym, Domenico Lalli, Paolo Antonio Rolli, Giovanni Claudio Pasquini, Ranieri de&#x27; Calzabigi and Giovanni Ambrogio Migliavacca.

== Structure ==
&quot;Opera seria&quot; built upon the conventions of the High Baroque era by developing and exploiting the &quot;da capo&quot; aria, with its A–B–A form. The first section presented a theme, the second a complementary one, and the third a repeat of the first with ornamentation and elaboration of the music by the singer. As the genre developed and arias grew longer, a typical &quot;opera seria&quot; would contain not more than thirty musical movements.

A typical opera would start with an instrumental overture of three movements (fast-slow-fast) and then a series of recitatives containing dialogue interspersed with arias expressing the emotions of the character, this pattern only broken by the occasional duet for the leading amatory couple. The recitative was typically &quot;secco&quot;: that is, accompanied only by &quot;continuo&quot; (usually harpsichord, theorbo, and cello, sometimes supported by further bass and chordal instruments). At moments of especially violent passion &quot;secco&quot; was replaced by &quot;stromentato&quot; (or &quot;accompagnato&quot;) recitative, where the singer was accompanied by the entire body of strings. After an aria was sung, accompanied by strings and oboe (and sometimes with horns or flutes), the character usually exited the stage, encouraging the audience to applaud. This continued for three acts before concluding with an upbeat chorus, to celebrate the jubilant climax. The leading singers each expected their fair share of arias of varied mood, be they sad, angry, heroic or meditative.

The dramaturgy of opera seria developed largely as a response to French criticism of what were often viewed as impure and corrupting librettos. As response, the Rome-based Academy of Arcadia sought to return Italian opera to what they viewed as neoclassical principles, obeying the classical unities of drama, defined by Aristotle, and replacing &quot;immoral&quot; plots, such as Busenello&#x27;s for &quot;L&#x27;incoronazione di Poppea&quot;, with highly moral narratives that aimed to instruct, as well as entertain. However, the often tragic endings of classical drama were rejected out of a sense of decorum: early writers of &quot;opera seria&quot; librettos such as Apostolo Zeno felt that virtue should be rewarded and shown triumphant, while the antagonists were to be put on their way to remorse. The spectacle and ballet, so common in French opera, were banished.

== Voices ==
The age of &quot;opera seria&quot; corresponded with the rise to prominence of the castrati, often prodigiously gifted male singers who had undergone castration before puberty in order to retain a high, powerful soprano or alto voice backed by decades of rigorous musical training. They were cast in heroic male roles, alongside another new breed of operatic creature, the prima donna. The rise of these star singers with formidable technical skills spurred composers to write increasingly complex vocal music, and many operas of the time were written as vehicles for specific singers. Of these the most famous is perhaps Farinelli, whose debut in 1722 was guided by Nicola Porpora. Though Farinelli did not sing for Handel, his main rival, Senesino, did.

== 1720–1740 ==
Opera seria acquired definitive form early during the 1720s. While Apostolo Zeno and Alessandro Scarlatti had paved the way, the genre only truly came to fruition due to Metastasio and later composers. Metastasio&#x27;s career began with the serenata &quot;Gli orti esperidi&quot; (&quot;The Gardens of the Hesperides&quot;). Nicola Porpora, (much later to be Haydn&#x27;s master), set the work to music, and the success was so great that the famed Roman &quot;prima donna&quot;, Marianna Bulgarelli, &quot;La Romanina&quot;, sought out Metastasio, and took him on as her protégé. Under her wing, Metastasio produced libretto after libretto, and they were rapidly set by the greatest composers in Italy and Austria, establishing the transnational tone of &quot;opera seria&quot;: &quot;Didone abbandonata&quot;, &quot;Catone in Utica&quot;, &quot;Ezio&quot;, &quot;Alessandro nelle Indie&quot;, &quot;Semiramide riconosciuta&quot;, &quot;Siroe&quot; and &quot;Artaserse&quot;. After 1730 he was settled in Vienna and turned out more librettos for the imperial theater, until the mid-1740s: &quot;Adriano in Siria&quot;, &quot;Demetrio&quot;, &#x27;, &quot;Demofoonte&quot;, &quot;Olimpiade&quot;, &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot;, &quot;Achille in Sciro&quot;, &quot;Temistocle&quot;, &quot;Il re pastore&quot; and what he regarded as his finest libretto, &#x27;. For the librettos, Metastasio and his imitators customarily drew on dramas featuring classical characters from antiquity bestowed with princely values and morality, struggling with conflicts between love, honour and duty, in elegant and ornate language that could be performed equally well as both opera and non-musical drama. On the other hand, Handel, working far outside the mainstream genre, set only a few Metastasio libretti for his London audience, preferring a greater diversity of texts.

At this time the leading Metastasian composers were Hasse, Caldara, Vinci, Porpora, and Pergolesi. Vinci&#x27;s settings of &quot;Didone abbandonata&quot; and &quot;Artaserse&quot; were much praised for their &quot;stromento&quot; recitative, and he played a crucial part in establishing the new style of melody. Hasse, by contrast, indulged in stronger accompaniment and was regarded at the time as the more adventurous of the two. Pergolesi was noted for his lyricism. The main challenge for all was achieving variety, a break from the pattern of &quot;recitativo secco&quot; and &quot;aria da capo&quot;. The mutable moods of Metastasio&#x27;s librettos helped, as did innovations made by the composer, such as &quot;stromento&quot; recitative or cutting a ritornello. During this period the choice of keys to reflect certain emotions became standardized: D minor became the choice key for a composer&#x27;s typical &quot;rage&quot; aria, while D major for pomp and bravura, G minor for pastoral effect and E flat for pathetic effect, became the usual options.

== 1740–1770 ==
After peaking during the 1750s, the popularity of the Metastasian model began to wane. New trends, popularized by composers such as Niccolò Jommelli and Tommaso Traetta, began to seep into &quot;opera seria&quot;. The Italianate pattern of alternating, sharply-contrasted recitative and aria began to give way to ideas from the French operatic tradition. Jommelli&#x27;s works from 1740 onwards increasingly favored accompanied recitative and greater dynamic contrast, as well as a more prominent role for the orchestra while limiting virtuosic vocal displays. Traetta reintroduced the ballet in his operas and restored the tragic, melodramatic endings of classical dramas. His operas, particularly after 1760, also gave a larger role to the chorus.

The culmination of these reforms arrived in the operas of Christoph Willibald Gluck. Beginning with &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot; (1762), Gluck drastically cut back on the possibilities for vocal virtuosity afforded to singers, abolished &quot;secco&quot; recitative (thereby heavily reducing the delineation between aria and recitative), and took great care to unify drama, dance, music, and theatrical practice in the synthesis of Italian and French traditions. He continued his reform with &quot;Alceste&quot; (1767) and &quot;Paride ed Elena&quot; (1770). Gluck paid great attention to orchestration and considerably increased the role of the chorus: he also cut back heavily on exit arias. The labyrinthine subplots that had riddled earlier baroque opera were eliminated. In 1768, the year after Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Alceste&quot;, Jommelli and his librettist Verazi produced &quot;Fetonte&quot;. Ensemble and chorus are predominant: the usual number of exit arias slashed in half. For the most part, however, these trends did not become mainstream until the 1790s, and the Metastasian model continued to dominate.

== 1770–1800 ==
Gluck&#x27;s reforms made most of the composers of &quot;opera seria&quot; of the previous decades obsolete. The careers of Hasse, Jommelli, Galuppi, and Traetta were effectively finished. Replacing them came a new wave of composers such as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Joseph Haydn, Johann Christian Bach, Carl Heinrich Graun, Antonio Salieri (a disciple of Gluck), Antonio Sacchini, Giuseppe Sarti, Niccolò Piccinni, Giovanni Paisiello and Domenico Cimarosa. The popularity of the &quot;aria da capo&quot; began to fade, replaced by the rondò. Orchestras grew in size, arias lengthened, ensembles became more prominent, and obbligato recitative became both common and more elaborate. While throughout the 1780s Metastasio&#x27;s libretti still dominated the repertory, a new group of Venetian librettists pushed &quot;opera seria&quot; in a new direction. The work of Gaetano Sertor and the group surrounding him finally broke the absolute dominance of the singers and gave &quot;opera seria&quot; a new impetus towards the spectacular and the dramatic elements of 19th-century Romantic opera. Tragic endings, on-stage death and regicide became the norm rather than the exception. By the final decade of the century &quot;opera seria&quot; as it had been traditionally defined was essentially dead, and the political upheavals that the French Revolution inspired swept it away once and for all.

==Social context==
With a few exceptions, &quot;opera seria&quot; was the opera of the court, of the monarchy and the nobility. This is not a universal picture: Handel in London composed not for the court but for a much more socially diverse audience, and in the Venetian republic composers modified their operas to suit the public taste and not that of the court. But for the most part, &quot;opera seria&quot; was synonymous with court opera. This brought with it a number of conditions: the court, and particularly the monarch, required that their own nobility be reflected on the stage. &quot;Opera seria&quot; plot-lines are heavily shaped by this criterion: &quot;Il re pastore&quot; displays the glory of Alexander the Great, while &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot; does the same for the Roman emperor Titus. The potentate in the audience would watch his counterparts from the ancient world and see their benevolent autocracy redound to his own credit.

Many aspects of the staging contributed to this effect: both the auditorium and stage were lit during performances, while the sets mirrored almost exactly the architecture of the palace hosting the opera. Sometimes the links between opera and audience were even closer: Gluck&#x27;s serenata &quot;Il Parnaso confuso&quot; was first performed at Vienna with a cast consisting of members of the royal family. However, with the French Revolution came serious political upheavals across Italy, and as new, more egalitarian republics were established and old autocracies fell away, the Arcadian ideals of &quot;opera seria&quot; seemed increasingly irrelevant. Rulers were no longer free from violent deaths, and under new social ideals the hierarchy of singers broke down. Such significant socio-political change meant that &quot;opera seria&quot;, so closely allied to the ruling class, was finished.

<text>The Baptist Union of Scotland is a Baptist Christian denomination in Scotland. It is affiliated with the Baptist World Alliance. The headquarters is north of the M8 in the Port Dundas areas of Glasgow.

==History==

===From the 1650s to 1869===
Baptists first arrived in Scotland with the armies of English republican Oliver Cromwell in the 1650s, who established small churches in Leith, Perth, Cupar, Ayr and Aberdeen, but they did not survive for long, partly because of their association with Cromwell (who was generally not welcomed in Scotland), but more especially as a result of strident and often violent opposition instigated and inspired by the Church of Scotland and the Parliament of Scotland which it controlled. Baptists later emerged in the 18th century—in 1750 at Keiss, where the leader was William Sinclair and the church was established on the English Baptist pattern. The group who in Edinburgh came to Baptist convictions in 1765 under the leadership of Robert Carmichael and Archibald McLean became known as Scotch Baptists. Like other Scottish Protestant Christians of the time they were very conservative and adopted the opinions of a particularly strict form of Calvinism. Somewhat later, a different form of Baptist witness emerged, this time influenced by the Haldane brothers, James Haldane and Robert Haldane evangelical preachers who came to Baptist convictions around 1808. Along with the &quot;English Baptists&quot;, they were distinguished from the Scotch Baptists by their more moderate and less Calvinistic attitudes. After overcoming initial hostilities, all these groups were able to unite in 1869.

===1869 to the present day===
The Baptist Union of Scotland was founded in Hope Street Chapel in Glasgow (later Adelaide Place Baptist Church) in 1869, with 51 churches in its membership, which represented almost 4000 members. One of its early presidents (in 1873) was the philanthropist Thomas Coats.

According to a census published by the association in 2023, it claimed 9,946 members and 156 churches.

The Baptist Union of Scotland is served by a National team comprising: Rev Martin Hodson (General Director), Rev. Lisa Holmes (Deeper Church Lead), Mr Brian Windram (Finance Director), Ms. Lyndsay Cameron-Ross (Communications Lead) Rev Ali Laing (Younger Generation &amp; Digital Church Lead), Rev Professor Andrew Clarke (Leadership Development Lead) and Rev. Glenn Innes (Future Church Lead).

==Beliefs==
The Convention has a Baptist confession of faith. It is a member of the Baptist World Alliance.

<doc id="357649" wikidata="Q243795" url="?curid=357649" title="Ang Thong province">
<text>Ang Thong (, ) or Angthong is one of the central provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) of Thailand. The name &quot;Ang Thong&quot; means &#x27;gold basin&#x27;, thought to have derived from the basin-like geography of the area, and the golden color of the rice grown in the region.

Neighboring provinces are (from north clockwise) Sing Buri, Lopburi, Ayutthaya, and Suphan Buri.

Ang Thong native handicrafts include moulded court dolls, firebrick, and wickerwork.

Ang Thong has more than 200 Buddhist temples, but there are nine distinct temples that are promoted as &quot;Paying Homage to Nine Auspicious Temples&quot;. This consists of , , , , Wat Mahanam, Wat Thasutthawat, Wat Siroi, Wat Khian and, where the Great Buddha of Thailand is enshrined.

==Geography==
Ang Thong occupies a low river plain, created by the Chao Phraya and the Noi Rivers. It has neither mountains nor forests, but consists of mostly agricultural land. The two rivers, together with many canals (&quot;khlongs&quot;), provide enough water for rice farming.

==History==

Ang Thong was historically known as &quot;Wiset Chai Chan&quot;, on the Noi River. It was an important border town of the Ayutthaya Kingdom during the wars with Burma, as the Noi River served as a natural obstacle for advancing troops.

During the reign of King Taksin after the fall of Ayutthaya, the main city of the province was moved to the Chao Phraya River, and named Ang Thong, as the Noi River had become silted and too shallow for transportation.

Ang Thong is the provenance of &quot;Likay&quot;, the native folk song, and the hometown of &quot;Nai Dok&quot; and &quot;Nai Thongkaeo&quot;, two heroes of the Bang Rachan Battle.

&quot;Khun Rong Palat Chu&quot; is another local hero of Ang Thong. His heroism is little known when compared to the villagers of Bang Rachan because only two lines were recorded in the Thai chronicles. He grouped up and led four hundred volunteer sword fighters under the name &quot;Kong Attamat&quot; to accompany the royal army from the capital during the royal army&#x27;s settlement at Mueang Kui (present-day Prachuap Khiri Khan Province). His group received a command to obstruct the Burmese army 8,000 people at Ao Wa Khao (in present-day Ao Noi, Mueang Prachuap Khiri Khan) in 1760 when King Alaungpaya of Burma invaded Myeik (Burmese–Siamese War (1759–60)) part of Ayutthaya Kingdom at that time. In the end, they all died of four hundred people. Nowadays, there is a monument built to commemorate his heroism at Wat Siroi, Wiset Chai Chan.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows some golden ears of rice in a bowl of water. This symbolizes the fertility of the province as one of the major producers of rice. The provincial tree is the gaub tree (&quot;Diospyros malabarica&quot;). The provincial fish is red tailed tinfoil (&quot;Barbonymus altus&quot;).

==Administrative divisions==

===Provincial government===

The province is divided into seven districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). The districts are further subdivided into 73 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 513 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).


===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Ang Thong Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 21 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Ang Thong has town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 20 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 43 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<doc id="357652" wikidata="Q254279" url="?curid=357652" title="Powwow">
<text>A powwow (also pow wow or pow-wow) is a gathering with dances held by many Native American and First Nations communities. Inaugurated in 1923, powwows today are an opportunity for Indigenous people to socialize, dance, sing, and honor their cultures. Powwows may be private or public, indoors or outdoors. Dancing events can be competitive with monetary prizes. Powwows vary in length from single-day to weeklong events.

In mainstream American culture, such as 20th-century Western movies or by military personnel, the term &quot;powwow&quot; was used to refer to any type of meeting. This usage is now considered by some Native Americans to be an offensive case of appropriation because of the cultural significance powwows hold.

== History ==
The word &quot;powwow&quot; is derived from the Narragansett word &quot;powwaw&quot;, meaning &quot;spiritual leader.&quot; The term has variants, including &quot;Powaw&quot;, &quot;Pawaw&quot;, &quot;Powah, Pauwau&quot; and &quot;Pawau&quot;. A number of nations claim to have held the &quot;first&quot; pow wow. Initially, public dances that most resemble what are now known as pow wows were most common in the Great Plains region of the United States during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a time when the United States government destroyed many Native communities in the hopes of acquiring land for economic exploitation. In 1923, Charles H. Burke, Commissioner of Indian Affairs in the United States, passed legislation modeled on Circular 1665, which he published in 1921. This legislation restricted the times of the year in which Native Americans could practice traditional dance, which Burke deemed as a direct threat to the Christian religion. However, many Native communities continued to gather together in secret to practice their cultures&#x27; dance and music in defiance of this and other legislation. By the mid-twentieth century, powwows were also being held in the Great Lakes region.

==Organization==

Planning for a powwow generally begins months, perhaps even a year, before the event by a group of people usually referred to as a powwow committee. Pow wows may be sponsored by a tribal organization, an American Native community within an urban area, a Native American Studies program, or an American Native club on a college or university campus, a tribe, or any other organization that can provide startup funds, insurance, and volunteer workers.

===Committee===
A powwow committee consists of several individuals who do all the planning before the event. If a pow wow has a sponsor, such as a tribe, college, or organization, many or all members of the committee may come from that group. The committee is responsible for recruiting and hiring the head staff, publicizing the powwow, securing a location, and recruiting vendors who pay for the right to set up and sell food or merchandise at the powwow.

===Staff===
The head staff of a pow-wow are the people who run the event on the day or days it occurs. They are generally hired by the powwow committee several months in advance, as the quality of the head staff can affect attendance. To be chosen as part of the head staff is an honor, showing respect for the person&#x27;s skills or dedication.

====Arena Director====

====Master of Ceremonies====
The master of ceremonies, or MC, is the voice of the pow wow. It is their job to keep the singers, dancers, and public informed as to what is happening. The MC sets the schedule of events and maintains the &quot;drum rotation&quot;, or order of when each drum group gets to sing. The MC is also responsible for filling any dead air time that may occur during the pow wow, often with jokes. The MC often runs any raffles or other contests that may happen during the pow wow.

====Head dancers====
The head dancers consist of the Head Man Dancer and the Head Woman Dancer, and often Head Teen Dancers, Head Little Boy and Girl Dancers, Head Golden Age Dancers, and a Head Gourd Dancer if the pow wow has a Gourd Dance. The head dancers lead the other dancers in the &quot;grand entry&quot; or parade of dancers that opens a pow-wow. In many cases, the head dancers are also responsible for leading the dancers during songs, and often dancers will not enter the arena unless the head dancers are already out dancing.

====Host drums and drum groups====
The singers perform while singing. Host drummers are responsible for leading songs at the beginning and end of a pow-wow session, typically starting with a grand entry song, followed by a flag song, veterans or victory song. To conclude the pow-wow, they also perform a flag song, retreat song, and a closing song. Additionally, if a pow-wow has gourd dancing, the Southern Host Drum is often the drum that sings all the gourd songs, though another drum can perform them. The host drums are often called upon to sing special songs during the pow-wow.

Famous host drums include Black Lodge Singers, Cozad Singers, and Yellowhammer.

==The event==

===Setup===

A pow wow is often set up as a series of large circles. The center circle is the &quot;dance arena&quot;, outside of which is a larger circle consisting of the MC&#x27;s table, drum groups, and sitting areas for dancers and their families. Beyond these two circles for participants is an area for spectators, while outside of all are designated areas with vendor&#x27;s booths, where one can buy food, music, jewelry, souvenirs, arts and crafts, beadwork, leather, and regalia supplies.

At outdoor pow wows, this circle is often covered by either a committee-built arbor or tent, or each group, particularly the MC and the drums, will provide their own. While most of the time, a tent provides shelter from the sun, rain can also plague outdoor events. It is particularly important to protect the drums used by the drum groups, as they are sensitive to temperature changes and, if it rains, they cannot get wet. Most vendors provide their own tents or shelters at an outdoor pow wow.

===Etiquette===
Pow-wow etiquette includes guidelines regarding acceptable behavior, such as rules for photography and protocol during the Grand Entry. Common practices emphasize respect for participants and traditions. The clothing worn by participants is referred to as &#x27;regalia&#x27; and should not be called a &#x27;costume.&#x27; Additionally, certain rules promote courtesy, such as refraining from touching or playing the drums unless one is part of the drum group. It is also important to avoid touching individuals or their regalia without permission. Certain tribes, including the Pascua Yaqui and Hopi, prohibit photography and sketching during ceremonies.

===Opening===

A pow-wow session begins with the Grand Entry and a prayer. The Eagle Staff leads the Grand Entry, followed by flags and then the dancers, while one of the host drums performs an opening song. This event is considered sacred, and some pow-wows prohibit filming or photography during this time, though others permit it.

When military veterans or active duty service members are present, they are often given the honor for carrying the flags and eagle staffs. These individuals are followed by the head dancers, after which the remaining dancers typically enter the arena in a designated order: Men&#x27;s Traditional, Men&#x27;s Grass Dance, Men&#x27;s Fancy, Women&#x27;s Traditional, Women&#x27;s Jingle, and Women&#x27;s Fancy. This sequence is then followed by teens and small children in the same order. After the Grand Entry, the master of ceremonies (MC) invites a respected member of the community to deliver an invocation. The host drum that did not perform the Grand Entry song will then perform a Flag Song, followed by a Victory or Veterans&#x27; Song, during which the flags and staffs are placed at the MC&#x27;s table.

===Dances===

The styles and types of dances at a pow wow are descended from the traditions of the Great Plains nations of Canada and the United States. Besides those for the opening and closing of a pow wow session, the most common is the &quot;intertribal&quot;, where a Drum will sing a song, and anyone who wants to can come and dance. Similar dances are the &quot;round dance&quot;; &quot;crow hop&quot; when performed by a northern drum or a &quot;horse stealing song&quot; by a southern drum; there is also &quot;double beat&quot;, &quot;sneakup&quot; and, for Women&#x27;s Traditional and Jingle, &quot;sidestep&quot;. Each of these songs have a different step to be used during them, but are open for dancers of any style.

In addition to the open dances, contest dances for a particular style and age group are often held, with the top winners receiving a cash prize. To compete in a contest, the dancer must be in regalia appropriate for the competition. Larger pow wows have more specific categories. The dance categories vary somewhat by region, but general categories are as follows:

====Men&#x27;s====
* Fancy Dance or Fancy Feather Dance (Northern and Southern styles): A dance featuring vivid regalia with dramatic movement, including spins and leaps. Fancy dancers are distinguished by their bright-colored regalia, which consists of two large bustles worn on the upper and lower back.
* Northern Traditional (simply &quot;Men&#x27;s Traditional&quot; in the North): A dance featuring traditional regalia, including a single bustle, usually of eagle feathers, ribbon shirt, bone hair pipe choker, and breastplate. Movements are based upon a warrior scouting before a battle or other storytelling traditions tracing to when the powwow was first danced as a ceremony. The dancers carry a dance staff and a fan usually made from the wing of an eagle.
* Straight dance (or Southern traditional): Straight dancers usually are more neat and with more handmade features such as chokers, breastplates, etc. Their dances are like Northern. They take one foot and step on the ball of their foot and then they tap it once on the ground. Then they tap it once again, but this time, they put their heel a few millimeters above the ground and repeat the process with the other foot. They do this in a walking motion. It is very hard especially when following the beat of fast drums. If they catch themselves off-beat they will tap their foot three times instead of two to get back with the drums&#x27; rhythm.
* Grass Dance: A dance featuring regalia with long, flowing fringe and designs reminiscent of grass blowing in the wind. Dance movements are more elaborate than the traditional dancers, but less flashy than the fancy dancers.
*Chicken dance: a recent dance originating with the Northern Plains tribes. Dancers imitate the mating dance of the prairie chicken by rocking their heads back and forth as they spin from side to side in slow majestic movements. Regalia is less elaborate than other dances. It usually includes a porcupine hair roach and two long pheasant tail feathers that curl backward with colored plumes. Dark, snug shirts and leggings are worn, covered by a drape over the chest and back with short fringe. The bustle is small, using small pheasant or eagle feathers circling the outside of the bustle board with bunches of small loose feathers or plumes in the centre. Dancers carry a mirror board or a gourd in one hand and an eagle tail feather fan in the other.
* Eastern War Dance: A dance from the East Coast that is a storytelling dance, Men wear no bustle however do carry a fan and dance stick. This is also called the &quot;Eastern Strait Dance&quot;.

====Women&#x27;s====
* Traditional (seen at Northern pow wows): A dance featuring traditional regalia of cloth or leather and dancers who perform with precise, highly controlled movement.
* Buckskin and Cloth: A traditional dance from the South. The name refers to the type of material from which the dress is made. The regalia is similar to the Northern traditional dance. However, in the South, buckskin and cloth dancers are judged in two separate categories. The dance steps are the same for both regalia categories.

* Fancy Shawl: A dance featuring women wearing brilliant colors, a long, usually fringed and decorated, shawl, performing rapid spins and elaborate dance steps.
* Jingle Dress (healing dance): The jingle dress includes a skirt with hundreds of small tin cones that make noise as the dancer moves with light footwork danced close to the ground.
Normal intertribal dancing is an individual activity, but there are also couples and group dances. Couples dances include the &quot;two step&quot; and &quot;owl dance&quot;. During a two step, each couple follows the lead of the head dancers, forming a line behind them. In contrast, in an owl dance, each couple dances alone. Group dances include the &quot;Snake and Buffalo&quot; dance, where the group dances to mimic the motions of a snake at the beginning of the dance, then changes to mimic the actions of a herd of buffalo.

At pow wows, where there is a large Southern Plains community in the area, the &quot;Gourd Dance&quot; is often included before the start of the pow wow sessions. The gourd dance originated with the Kiowa tribe and spread from there. It is a society dance for veterans and their families. Unlike other dances, the gourd dance is normally performed with the drum in the center of the dance arena, not on the side.

==Music==

Though there are many genres unique to different tribes, pow wow music is characterized by pan or intertribalism with the Plains cultures, the originators of the modern pow wow, predominating. For information on dancing, see &quot;Dances&quot;.

===Drumming===

: &quot;Good drums get the dancers out there, good songs get them to dance well. Without drum groups, there is no music. No music, no dance, no powwow.&quot;

There may be many drums at a pow wow, especially weekend or week-long ones, but each pow wow features a &quot;host drum,&quot; which is accorded great respect. The members of drum groups are often family, extended family, or friends. Groups are then often named for families, geographic locations, tribal societies, or more colorful names. Many groups display their names on jackets, caps, vehicles, and chairs. Traditionally, only men would drum and women would sit behind the men, singing high harmonies. Beginning in the mid-1970s, women began drumming with men and &quot;seconding&quot;, or singing, an octave higher, the song. Today, there are mixed-gender and all-female drum groups.

The supplies a drum group carries include the drum, rawhide headed, a cloth bag for padded drum sticks, the drum stand, folding chairs for sitting, and, in some cases, a public address system. The drum head, stand, microphone stands, and PA box are often decorated with paintings or eagle feathers, fur, flags, and strips of colored cloth.
Readily noticeable in performances are the &quot;hard beats&quot; used to indicate sections of the song. The &quot;traditional method&quot; consists of a pronounced strike by all singers every other beat. These may appear in the first or second line of a song, the end of a section, before the repetition of a song. A cluster of three hard beats (on consecutive beats) may be used at the end of a series of hard beats, while a few beats in the first line of a song indicate performer enthusiasm. In the &quot;Hot Five&quot; method five beats are used, with the first hard beat four beats before the second, after which the beats alternate.

====Etiquette====
To understand drum protocol, a drum may be thought of as a person or being and is to be regarded and respected as such. Drum etiquette is highly important. There are regional variations. The drum is the central symbol of Oklahoma pow wows and is located in the center of the dance floor and pow wow (which are themselves shaped in concentric circles). Southern drums are suspended by four posts, one for each direction. Northern drums are set up on the outside of the dance area, with the host drum in the best position. Drummer-singers are expected to remain at their drum and ready to sing at any moment&#x27;s notice; a dancer might approach the drum and whistle, fan, or gesture his staff over a drum to indicate his request for a song even if it is not that drum group&#x27;s turn to sing. In some regions, it is considered disrespectful to leave a drum completely unattended. Some drum groups do not allow females to sit down at their drum but welcome them to stand behind the drummers and sing backup harmonies; the reasons for this point vaguely to a variety of tribal stories that attempt to tell the history of drumming as each group understands it. The drum is offered gifts of tobacco during giveaways and musicians acknowledge this by standing.

===Singing===
While the drum is central to pow wows, &quot;the drum only helps them keep beat. Dancers key on the melody of the song. Rhythms, tones, pitch all help create their &#x27;moves&#x27;.&quot; (p. 85) Note that Bill Runs Above did not mention the lyrics of the songs, and while they are no doubt important, most lyrics of most songs employ vocables, syllable sounds such as &quot;ya,&quot; &quot;hey,&quot; and &quot;loi&quot; (p. 86). This is particularly evident in intertribal songs, such as the AIM Song, which cannot be biased towards a certain language.
The song structure consists of four &quot;pushups&quot;, singing through the chorus and verse four times. In each chorus, the melody is introduced or &quot;led off&quot; by the lead singer, who is then &quot;seconded&quot; by another singer. The second singer begins to vary the melody before the leader&#x27;s first line ends. They are then joined by the entire chorus for the rest of the pushup. Three &quot;down strokes&quot; or &quot;hard beats&quot; mark the end of the chorus and beginning of the verse, and during these dancers will alter their dancing such as by hopping low like fancy dancers. An increase in tempo and volume on the last five beats marks the end of the final verse. The dancing stops on the final beat and then a &quot;tail&quot;, or coda, finishes the song with a shortened chorus. Sometimes a drum group will sing the song more than four times, particularly when the song feels good and the singers seize the moment for an extra pushup or two (or more), or when a dancer blows a whistle or passes his staff or fan over the drum to signal that the song is to be continued four extra pushups while he prays.

Singing differs by region in that a high falsetto is used in the north, while in the south, a lower range is used. &quot;To the unfamiliar listener, Indian singing sounds exotic, different, and difficult to comprehend,&quot; and the contrast in the quality or timbre of voice used in traditional Indian and European music may have much to do with that difficulty. However, &quot;to the trained ear, melodies flow, ascend and descend&quot; while dancers react to changes in the structure of the melody and the song. Boye Ladd says, &quot;If you give me a stink song, I&#x27;ll dance stink. If you give me good music, I&#x27;ll give you a great show,&quot; implying that one can appreciate the music through the dancing, which is readily appreciated by everyone. But others say that today&#x27;s contemporary contest dancers should dance their best no matter how well or poorly the drum group singing for their contest is. Generally, Native American singing follows a pentatonic scale, like playing only the black keys on a piano. While to the outsider, it may simply sound like drum beats accompanied by vocables, some songs include words in Cree, Pikuni, Lushuutsid, Niimipuu, Lakhota, Sahpatin, Salish, Ojibwemowin, or many other Native languages.

<text>Fortín de las Flores is a city in the Mexican state of Veracruz. Fortín de las Flores is the municipal seat of Fortín municipality, which borders the municipalities of Córdoba, Naranjal and Ixtaczoquitlán. It stands on Federal Highways 190 and 180 and the Mexico City to Veracruz railway.

In the 2005 INEGI Census, the city reported a total population of 18,965, with 53,311 in the surrounding municipality.

The ravine of Metlac, which borders the Cañón del Río Blanco National Park, is the most famous feature of Fortín de las Flores.

The residents of Fortín de las Flores are considered by freighthopping Central American migrants to be some of the most generous in Mexico.

Fortín de las Flores is home to many insects due to its pleasant weather all year round, with minimal fluctuation in temperature, ranging from 20-32 °C daily. Most notably, it serves as a significant habitat for the Mexican colonial orb-weaving spider, &quot;Metepeira incrassata&quot;.

<doc id="357657" wikidata="Q4454926" url="?curid=357657" title="Bloch's theorem">
<text>In condensed matter physics, Bloch&#x27;s theorem states that solutions to the Schrödinger equation in a periodic potential can be expressed as plane waves modulated by periodic functions. The theorem is named after the Swiss physicist Felix Bloch, who discovered the theorem in 1929. Mathematically, they are written
 u(\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding

|border colour = rgb(80,200,120)
|background colour = rgb(80,200,120,10%)}}
where formula_1 is position, formula_2 is the wave function, formula_3 is a periodic function with the same periodicity as the crystal, the wave vector formula_4 is the crystal momentum vector, formula_5 is Euler&#x27;s number, and formula_6 is the imaginary unit.

Functions of this form are known as Bloch functions or Bloch states, and serve as a suitable basis for the wave functions or states of electrons in crystalline solids.

The description of electrons in terms of Bloch functions, termed Bloch electrons (or less often &quot;Bloch Waves&quot;), underlies the concept of electronic band structures.

These eigenstates are written with subscripts as formula_7, where formula_8 is a discrete index, called the band index, which is present because there are many different wave functions with the same formula_4 (each has a different periodic component formula_3). Within a band (i.e., for fixed formula_8), formula_7 varies continuously with formula_4, as does its energy. Also, formula_7 is unique only up to a constant reciprocal lattice vector formula_15, or, formula_16. Therefore, the wave vector formula_4 can be restricted to the first Brillouin zone of the reciprocal lattice without loss of generality.

== Applications and consequences ==

=== Applicability ===
The most common example of Bloch&#x27;s theorem is describing electrons in a crystal, especially in characterizing the crystal&#x27;s electronic properties, such as electronic band structure. However, a Bloch-wave description applies more generally to any wave-like phenomenon in a periodic medium. For example, a periodic dielectric structure in electromagnetism leads to photonic crystals, and a periodic acoustic medium leads to phononic crystals. It is generally treated in the various forms of the dynamical theory of diffraction.

=== Wave vector ===
Suppose an electron is in a Bloch state
formula_18
where is periodic with the same periodicity as the crystal lattice. The actual quantum state of the electron is entirely determined by formula_2, not or directly. This is important because and are &quot;not&quot; unique. Specifically, if formula_2 can be written as above using , it can &quot;also&quot; be written using , where is any reciprocal lattice vector (see figure at right). Therefore, wave vectors that differ by a reciprocal lattice vector are equivalent, in the sense that they characterize the same set of Bloch states.

The first Brillouin zone is a restricted set of values of with the property that no two of them are equivalent, yet every possible is equivalent to one (and only one) vector in the first Brillouin zone. Therefore, if we restrict to the first Brillouin zone, then every Bloch state has a unique . Therefore, the first Brillouin zone is often used to depict all of the Bloch states without redundancy, for example in a band structure, and it is used for the same reason in many calculations.

When is multiplied by the reduced Planck constant, it equals the electron&#x27;s crystal momentum. Related to this, the group velocity of an electron can be calculated based on how the energy of a Bloch state varies with ; for more details see crystal momentum.

=== Detailed example ===
For a detailed example in which the consequences of Bloch&#x27;s theorem are worked out in a specific situation, see the article Particle in a one-dimensional lattice (periodic potential).

== Statement ==
 u(\mathbf{r}),&lt;/math&gt; where has the same periodicity as the atomic structure of the crystal, such that formula_21

A second and equivalent way to state the theorem is the following

(\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{a}) = e^{i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{a}}\psi_{\mathbf{k}}(\mathbf{x}).&lt;/math&gt;

== Proof ==

=== Using lattice periodicity ===
Bloch&#x27;s theorem, being a statement about lattice periodicity, all the symmetries in this proof are encoded as translation symmetries of the wave function itself.
 e^{-i\mathbf{k}\cdot \mathbf{a}_j} \big) \big( e^{2\pi i \theta_j} \psi(\mathbf{r}) \big) \\
&amp;= e^{-i\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}} e^{-2\pi i \theta_j} e^{2\pi i \theta_j} \psi(\mathbf{r}) \\
&amp;= u(\mathbf{r}).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
This proves that has the periodicity of the lattice. Since formula_22 that proves that the state is a Bloch state.}}
Finally, we are ready for the main proof of Bloch&#x27;s theorem which is as follows.

As above, let formula_23 denote a &quot;translation operator&quot; that shifts every wave function by the amount , where are integers. Because the crystal has translational symmetry, this operator commutes with the Hamiltonian operator. Moreover, every such translation operator commutes with every other. Therefore, there is a simultaneous eigenbasis of the Hamiltonian operator and every possible formula_24 operator. This basis is what we are looking for. The wave functions in this basis are energy eigenstates (because they are eigenstates of the Hamiltonian), and they are also Bloch states (because they are eigenstates of the translation operators; see Lemma above).

=== Using operators ===
In this proof all the symmetries are encoded as commutation properties of the translation operators
_{\mathbf{n}}\psi(\mathbf{r})&amp;= \psi(\mathbf{r}+\mathbf{T}_{\mathbf{n}}) \\
&amp;= \psi(\mathbf{r}+n_1\mathbf{a}_1+n_2\mathbf{a}_2+n_3\mathbf{a}_3) \\
&amp;= \psi(\mathbf{r}+\mathbf{A}\mathbf{n})
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
with
formula_25
We use the hypothesis of a mean periodic potential
formula_26
and the independent electron approximation with an Hamiltonian
formula_27
Given the Hamiltonian is invariant for translations it shall commute with the translation operator
formula_28
and the two operators shall have a common set of eigenfunctions.
Therefore, we start to look at the eigen-functions of the translation operator:
formula_29
Given formula_30 is an additive operator 
formula_31
If we substitute here the eigenvalue equation and dividing both sides for formula_32 we have
formula_33

This is true for 
formula_34
where formula_35 if we use the normalization condition over a single primitive cell of volume V
formula_36
and therefore
formula_37 and formula_38 where formula_39. Finally,
formula_40
which is true for a Bloch wave i.e. for formula_41 with formula_42

=== Using group theory ===
Apart from the group theory technicalities this proof is interesting because it becomes clear how to generalize the Bloch theorem for groups that are not only translations.
This is typically done for space groups which are a combination of a translation and a point group and it is used for computing the band structure, spectrum and specific heats of crystals given a specific crystal group symmetry like FCC or BCC and eventually an extra basis.
In this proof it is also possible to notice how it is key that the extra point group is driven by a symmetry in the effective potential but it shall commute with the Hamiltonian.
\hat{\boldsymbol{\tau}}_1 \hat{\boldsymbol{\tau}}_2 \hat{\boldsymbol{\tau}}_3
&lt;/math&gt; where formula_43

The commutativity of the formula_44 operators gives three commuting cyclic subgroups (given they can be generated by only one element) which are infinite, 1-dimensional and abelian. All irreducible representations of abelian groups are one dimensional.

Given they are one dimensional the matrix representation and the character are the same. The character is the representation over the complex numbers of the group or also the trace of the representation which in this case is a one dimensional matrix. 
All these subgroups, given they are cyclic, they have characters which are appropriate roots of unity. In fact they have one generator formula_45 which shall obey to formula_46, and therefore the character formula_47. Note that this is straightforward in the finite cyclic group case but in the countable infinite case of the infinite cyclic group (i.e. the translation group here) there is a limit for formula_48 where the character remains finite.

Given the character is a root of unity, for each subgroup the character can be then written as
formula_49

If we introduce the Born–von Karman boundary condition on the potential:
formula_50
where &quot;L&quot; is a macroscopic periodicity in the direction formula_51 that can also be seen as a multiple of formula_52 where formula_53

This substituting in the time independent Schrödinger equation with a simple effective Hamiltonian
formula_54
induces a periodicity with the wave function:
formula_55

And for each dimension a translation operator with a period &quot;L&quot;
formula_56

From here we can see that also the character shall be invariant by a translation of formula_57:
formula_58
and from the last equation we get for each dimension a periodic condition:
formula_59
where formula_60 is an integer and formula_61

The wave vector formula_62 identify the irreducible representation in the same manner as formula_63, and formula_64 is a macroscopic periodic length of the crystal in direction formula_65. In this context, the wave vector serves as a quantum number for the translation operator.

We can generalize this for 3 dimensions
formula_66
and the generic formula for the wave function becomes:
formula_67
i.e. specializing it for a translation
formula_68
and we have proven Bloch’s theorem.

In the generalized version of the Bloch theorem, the Fourier transform, i.e. the wave function expansion, gets generalized from a discrete Fourier transform which is applicable only for cyclic groups, and therefore translations, into a character expansion of the wave function where the characters are given from the specific finite point group.

Also here is possible to see how the characters (as the invariants of the irreducible representations) can be treated as the fundamental building blocks instead of the irreducible representations themselves.

== Velocity and effective mass ==
If we apply the time-independent Schrödinger equation to the Bloch wave function we obtain
formula_69
with boundary conditions
formula_70
Given this is defined in a finite volume we expect an infinite family of eigenvalues; here formula_71 is a parameter of the Hamiltonian and therefore we arrive at a &quot;continuous family&quot; of eigenvalues formula_72 dependent on the continuous parameter formula_71 and thus at the basic concept of an electronic band structure.

This shows how the effective momentum can be seen as composed of two parts,
formula_74
a standard momentum formula_75 and a crystal momentum formula_76. More precisely the crystal momentum is not a momentum but it stands for the momentum in the same way as the electromagnetic momentum in the minimal coupling, and as part of a canonical transformation of the momentum.

For the effective velocity we can derive
 = \frac {\hbar^2}{m} \int 
d\mathbf{r}\, \psi^{*}_{n\mathbf{k}} (-i \nabla)\psi_{n\mathbf{k}} = \frac {\hbar}{m}\langle\hat{\mathbf{p}}\rangle = \hbar \langle\hat{\mathbf{v}}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/math&gt; and formula_77
given they are the coefficients of the following expansion in where is considered small with respect to 
formula_78
Given formula_79 are eigenvalues of formula_80
We can consider the following perturbation problem in q:

Perturbation theory of the second order states that
formula_82
To compute to linear order in 
formula_83
where the integrations are over a primitive cell or the entire crystal, given if the integral 
formula_84
is normalized across the cell or the crystal.

We can simplify over to obtain
formula_85
and we can reinsert the complete wave functions
formula_86

For the effective mass
\frac{\hbar^2}{m} \mathbf{q} \cdot (-i\nabla + \mathbf{k}) 
u_{n&#x27;\mathbf{k}}
|^2} 
{\varepsilon_{n\mathbf{k}} - \varepsilon_{n&#x27;\mathbf{k}}}
&lt;/math&gt;
Again with formula_87 
formula_88
Eliminating formula_89 and formula_90 we have the theorem
formula_91
The quantity on the right multiplied by a factorformula_92 is called effective mass tensor formula_93 and we can use it to write a semi-classical equation for a charge carrier in a band

where formula_51 is an acceleration. This equation is analogous to the de Broglie wave type of approximation

As an intuitive interpretation, both of the previous two equations resemble formally and are in a semi-classical analogy with Newton&#x27;s second law for an electron in an external Lorentz force.

== History and related equations ==

The concept of the Bloch state was developed by Felix Bloch in 1928 to describe the conduction of electrons in crystalline solids. The same underlying mathematics, however, was also discovered independently several times: by George William Hill (1877), Gaston Floquet (1883), and Alexander Lyapunov (1892). As a result, a variety of nomenclatures are common: applied to ordinary differential equations, it is called Floquet theory (or occasionally the &quot;Lyapunov–Floquet theorem&quot;). The general form of a one-dimensional periodic potential equation is Hill&#x27;s equation:
formula_95
where is a periodic potential. Specific periodic one-dimensional equations include the Kronig–Penney model and Mathieu&#x27;s equation.

Mathematically Bloch&#x27;s theorem is interpreted in terms of unitary characters of a lattice group, and is applied to spectral geometry.

<text>Eduardo Mata (5 September 19424 January 1995) was a Mexican conductor and composer.

== Career ==
Mata was born in Mexico City. He studied guitar privately for three years before enrolling in the National Conservatory of Music. From 1960 to 1963 he studied composition under Carlos Chávez, and Julián Orbón. In 1964 he received a Koussevitzky Memorial Fellowship to study at Tanglewood. There, he studied conducting with Max Rudolf and Erich Leinsdorf and composition with Gunther Schuller.

He composed several works in the 1950s and 1960s, including three symphonies and chamber works, which include sonatas for piano and for cello and piano. His Third Symphony and some of his chamber works have been recorded.

In 1965 he was appointed head of the Music Department of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and conductor of the Guadalajara Orchestra; He also conducted the orchestra at the university, which later became the National Autonomous University of Mexico Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1972, he left Mexico to take the position of principal conductor of the Phoenix Symphony. The next year he was appointed the Phoenix ensemble&#x27;s music director, holding that position through the 1977–78 season.

In 1965, he was one of the founding members and later, honorary president of the Mahler Mexico Society (Sociedad Mahler México) and together with Mexico&#x27;s National Symphony Orchestra (Orquesta Sinfonica Nacional), in October 1975 he conducted the first full cycle of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s symphonies in Mexico.

From 1977 to 1993 he was music director of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and guest conductor of several orchestras in the U.S., Europe and Latin America. He recorded over fifty albums, most of them with the UNAM Symphony Orchestra, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, and the London Symphony Orchestra. He was also appointed principal conductor of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and was about to take up this post in January 1995 when he was killed.

On the morning of 4 January 1995, Mata and a passenger were en route from Cuernavaca, Morelos, to Dallas, Texas. Mata was piloting his own Piper Aerostar. One engine failed shortly after takeoff, and the plane crashed during an emergency landing attempt. Both died in the crash, near Mexico City.

<text>Yax Nuun Ahiin I, also known as Curl Snout and Curl Nose (died 17 June 404?), was a 4th-century ruler of the Maya city of Tikal. His name, when transcribed, is YAX-?-AH:N, translated &quot;First ? Crocodile&quot;. He took the throne on 12 September 379 and reigned until his death. He is referred to by the Mayan title &quot;ajaw&quot;, meaning &quot;lord&quot;.

==Biography==
Yax Nuun Ahiin I was a son of Spearthrower Owl, a lord of Teotihuacan (probably that city&#x27;s king) in central Mexico. The installation of a Teotihuacano noble on the throne of Tikal marks a high point of Teotihuacan influence in the central Maya lowlands. Yax Nuun Ahiin I may have been a child or youth at the time of his coronation, and the early years of his reign seem to have been dominated by one of his father&#x27;s generals, Sihyaj K&#x27;ahk&#x27;, in a sort of regency. Sihyaj K&#x27;ahk&#x27; is recorded as having entered Tikal on 15 May 378, the same date as the death of the previous ruler, Chak Tok Ich&#x27;aak I; it appears that this event may have been a conquest in which Yax Nuun Ahiin I was installed by force.

Two monuments at Tikal, Stela 4 and Stela 18, are associated with Yax Nuun Ahiin I. Both stelae depict him in Mexican rather than Mayan attire, demonstrating his Teotihuacano origins. He is also depicted on Stela 31, erected by his son Sihyaj Chan K&#x27;awiil II, as a Teotihuacano warrior with a plated helmet, spearthrower, and square shield decorated with the face of Central Mexican deities. His wife&#x27;s titles indicate that she may have been a Mayan woman, presumably chosen to integrate his bloodline with the local elites.

It is unclear when Yax Nuun Ahiin I died. Stela 31&#x27;s text indicates that his burial occurred in 404, though the text from another sculpture known as the Hombre de Tikal suggests that he may have still been alive in November 406. On the other hand, the K&#x27;atun ceremony of May 406, which would ordinarily be presided over by the ruler, is recorded as having been presided over by an otherwise unknown individual called Sihyaj Chan K&#x27;inich. This suggests that there may have been an interregnum, possibly with Sihyaj Chan K&#x27;inich governing temporarily as a regent, before Sihyaj Chan K&#x27;awiil II was enthroned in November 411.

==Tomb==
The tomb of Yax Nuun Ahiin I, known as &quot;Burial 10&quot;, was discovered by University of Pennsylvania archaeologists in the 1950s. It was found deep within a temple built at the foot of the North Acropolis and represents one of the most spectacular and complete Mayan burials yet discovered. The ruler&#x27;s body had been placed on a wooden funerary bier surrounded by the bodies of at least nine sacrificed youths ranging in age from about six years old to young adulthood. At least one of the sacrificial victims appears to have died inside the funerary chamber. A headless crocodile was also interred with the dead ruler, probably alluding to his name.

Numerous offerings were deposited around the chamber, including pottery vessels decorated with Mexican motifs and images of Mexican deities. Among the artefacts were a Maya-style censer in the shape of an elderly deity seated on a stool made from human long bones, turtle carapaces that had been arranged to form a kind of xylophone and a jade ornament in the form of a curl-snouted crocodile.

<doc id="357672" wikidata="Q278079" url="?curid=357672" title="Posterior probability">
<text>The posterior probability is a type of conditional probability that results from updating the prior probability with information summarized by the likelihood via an application of Bayes&#x27; rule. From an epistemological perspective, the posterior probability contains everything there is to know about an uncertain proposition (such as a scientific hypothesis, or parameter values), given prior knowledge and a mathematical model describing the observations available at a particular time. After the arrival of new information, the current posterior probability may serve as the prior in another round of Bayesian updating.

In the context of Bayesian statistics, the posterior [[probability distribution]] usually describes the epistemic uncertainty about statistical parameters conditional on a collection of observed data. From a given posterior distribution, various point and interval estimates can be derived, such as the maximum a posteriori (MAP) or the highest posterior density interval (HPDI). But while conceptually simple, the posterior distribution is generally not tractable and therefore needs to be either analytically or numerically approximated.

==Definition in the distributional case==

In Bayesian statistics, the posterior probability is the probability of the parameters formula_1 given the evidence formula_2, and is denoted formula_3.

It contrasts with the likelihood function, which is the probability of the evidence given the parameters: formula_4.

The two are related as follows:

Given a prior belief that a probability distribution function is formula_5 and that the observations formula_6 have a likelihood formula_7, then the posterior probability is defined as 
:formula_8,
where formula_9 is the normalizing constant and is calculated as
:formula_10
for continuous formula_1, 
or by summing formula_12
over all possible values of formula_1 for discrete formula_1.

The posterior probability is therefore proportional to the product &quot;Likelihood · Prior probability&quot;.

==Example==

Suppose there is a school with 60% boys and 40% girls as students. The girls wear trousers or skirts in equal numbers; all boys wear trousers. An observer sees a (random) student from a distance; all the observer can see is that this student is wearing trousers. What is the probability this student is a girl? The correct answer can be computed using Bayes&#x27; theorem.

The event is that the student observed is a girl, and the event is that the student observed is wearing trousers. To compute the posterior probability formula_15, we first need to know:
* formula_16, or the probability that the student is a girl regardless of any other information. Since the observer sees a random student, meaning that all students have the same probability of being observed, and the percentage of girls among the students is 40%, this probability equals 0.4.
* formula_17, or the probability that the student is not a girl (i.e. a boy) regardless of any other information ( is the complementary event to ). This is 60%, or 0.6.
* formula_18, or the probability of the student wearing trousers given that the student is a girl. As they are as likely to wear skirts as trousers, this is 0.5.
* formula_19, or the probability of the student wearing trousers given that the student is a boy. This is given as 1.
* formula_20, or the probability of a (randomly selected) student wearing trousers regardless of any other information. Since formula_21 (via the law of total probability), this is formula_22.

Given all this information, the posterior probability of the observer having spotted a girl given that the observed student is wearing trousers can be computed by substituting these values in the formula:

:formula_23

An intuitive way to solve this is to assume the school has &quot;N&quot; students. Number of boys = 0.6&quot;N&quot; and number of girls = 0.4&quot;N&quot;. If &quot;N&quot; is sufficiently large, total number of trouser wearers = 0.6&quot;N&quot; + 50% of 0.4&quot;N&quot;. And number of girl trouser wearers = 50% of 0.4&quot;N&quot;. Therefore, in the population of trousers, girls are (50% of 0.4&quot;N&quot;)/(0.6&quot;N&quot; + 50% of 0.4&quot;N&quot;) = 25%. In other words, if you separated out the group of trouser wearers, a quarter of that group will be girls. Therefore, if you see trousers, the most you can deduce is that you are looking at a single sample from a subset of students where 25% are girls. And by definition, chance of this random student being a girl is 25%. Every Bayes-theorem problem can be solved in this way.

== Calculation ==

The posterior probability distribution of one random variable given the value of another can be calculated with Bayes&#x27; theorem by multiplying the prior probability distribution by the likelihood function, and then dividing by the normalizing constant, as follows:

:formula_24

gives the posterior probability density function for a random variable formula_2 given the data formula_26, where

* formula_27 is the prior density of formula_2,
* formula_29 is the likelihood function as a function of formula_6,
* formula_31 is the normalizing constant, and
* formula_32 is the posterior density of formula_2 given the data formula_26.

==Credible interval==

Posterior probability is a conditional probability conditioned on randomly observed data. Hence it is a random variable. For a random variable, it is important to summarize its amount of uncertainty. One way to achieve this goal is to provide a credible interval of the posterior probability. 

==Classification==

In classification, posterior probabilities reflect the uncertainty of assessing an observation to particular class, see also class-membership probabilities. 
While statistical classification methods by definition generate posterior probabilities, Machine Learners usually supply membership values which do not induce any probabilistic confidence. It is desirable to transform or rescale membership values to class-membership probabilities, since they are comparable and additionally more easily applicable for post-processing.

<doc id="357674" wikidata="Q940279" url="?curid=357674" title="Melusine">
<text>Mélusine () or Melusine or Melusina is a figure of European folklore, a female spirit of fresh water in a holy well or river. She is usually depicted as a woman who is a serpent or fish from the waist down (much like a lamia or a mermaid). She is also sometimes illustrated with wings, two tails, or both. Her legends are especially connected with the northern and western areas of France, Luxembourg, and the Low Countries. 

The Limburg-Luxemburg dynasty (which ruled the Holy Roman Empire from 1308 to 1437 as well as Bohemia and Hungary), the House of Anjou and their descendants the House of Plantagenet (kings of England), and the French House of Lusignan (kings of Cyprus from 1205–1472, and for shorter periods over Cilician Armenia and Jerusalem) are said in folk tales and medieval literature to be descended from Melusine. The story combines several major legendary themes, such as the Nereids, Naiad, water nymph or mermaid, the earth being (terroir), the &quot;genius loci&quot; or guardian spirit of a location, the succubus who comes from the diabolical world to unite carnally with a man, or the banshee or harbinger of death.

==Etymology==
The French &quot;Dictionnaire de la langue française&quot; suggests the Latin &quot;melus&quot;, meaning &quot;melodious, pleasant&quot;. Another theory is that Melusine was inspired by a Poitevin legend of &quot;Mère Lusine,&quot; leader of a band of fairies who built Roman edifices throughout the countryside. Melusine&#x27;s name varies depending on the areas, such as Merlusse in Vosges or Merluisaine in Champagne. 

==Literary versions==

The most famous literary version of Melusine tales, that of Jean d&#x27;Arras, compiled about 1382–1394, was worked into a collection of &quot;spinning yarns&quot; as told by ladies at their spinning . He wrote &quot;The Romans of Partenay or of Lusignen: Otherwise known as the Tale of Melusine&quot;, giving source and historical notes, dates and background of the story. He goes into detail and depth about the relationship of Melusine and Raymondin, their initial meeting, and the complete story.

The tale was translated into German in 1456 by Thüring von Ringoltingen, which version became popular as a chapbook. It was later translated into English, twice, around 1500, and often printed in both the 15th century and the 16th century. There are also a Castilian and a Dutch translation, both of which were printed at the end of the 15th century. A prose version is entitled the &quot;Chronique de la princesse&quot; (&quot;Chronicle of the Princess&quot;).

The story tells how in the time of the Crusades, Elinas, the King of Albany (an old name for Scotland or the Kingdom of Alba), goes out hunting in the forest to cope with the death of his wife with whom he has one son named Nathas. Elinas comes across the Well of Thirst where he meets a beautiful fay named Pressine. The two fall in love and when Elinas proposes to Pressine, she agrees, but only if he swears to never see her when she births or bathes their children; Elinas promises and he and Pressine marry. Later, Pressine gives birth to triplet girls named Melusine, Melior, and Palatine. When Nathas informs his father the news, he breaks his promise, causing Pressine to leave the kingdom with their three daughters and move to the lost Isle of Avalon.

The three sisters grow up in Avalon, their mother bringing them atop a mountain every morning to look at the kingdom that would have been their home. On their fifteenth birthday, Melusine, the eldest, asks her mother why she and her sisters had been taken from Alba. Upon hearing of their father&#x27;s broken promise, Melusine seeks revenge and convinces her sisters to aid her. Using their magical powers, Elinas&#x27; daughters lock him, with his riches, in a mountain called Brandelois. Pressine becomes enraged when she learns what her daughters have done for despite breaking his promise, Elinas was her husband and the triplets&#x27; father. To punish her daughters for killing their own father, Pressine imprisons Palatine in the same mountain as Elinas, seals Melior inside a castle for all her life, and banishes Melusine, the instigator, from Avalon and also cursing her to take the form of a two-tailed serpent from the waist down every Saturday. If a man ever marries Melusine, he must never see her on Saturdays: if he keeps the oath, Melusine will live a contented life with him, but if he breaks it and violates her privacy, she will stay a serpent and appear to the Noble House in her monstrous form and spend three days lamenting whenever a descendant dies or the fortress changes hands.

Melusine settles in a forest of Coulombiers by a stream near Poitiers (or Poitou in some versions) in France. The distraught Count Raymondin of Poitiers comes across Melusine after accidentally killing his uncle. Melusine consoles Raymondin and when he proposes to her, she lays down a condition just as her mother had done: that he must never see her on a Saturday. For ten years Raymondin keeps his promise, and Melusine bears him ten sons (which some versions describe as being deformed yet still loved by their parents) and organizes the construction of marvelous castles, giving her husband wealth, land, and power. However, Raymondin is eventually goaded by his family and grows suspicious of Melusine always spending Saturday by herself and never attending Mass. He breaks his promise and peeks into her chamber, where he sees Melusine bathing in half-serpent form. He keeps his transgression a secret, until one of their now-adult sons murders his brother. In front of his court, the grieving Raymondin blames Melusine and calls her a &quot;serpent.&quot; She then assumes the form of a dragon, provides him with two magic rings, and flies off, never to be seen again. She returns only at night to nurse her two youngest children, who are still infants.

== Analysis ==
In folkloristics, German folklorist Hans-Jörg Uther classifies the Melusine tale and related legends as its own tale type of the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index. In the German Folktale Catalogue (German: &quot;Deutscher Märchenkatalog&quot;), they are grouped under type *425O, &quot;Melusine&quot;, part of a section related to tales where a human maiden marries a supernatural husband in animal form (Animal as Bridegroom).

As in tales of swan maidens, shapeshifting and flight on wings away from oath-breaking husbands figure in stories about Mélusine. According to Sabine Baring-Gould in &quot;Curious Tales of the Middle Ages&quot;, the pattern of the tale is similar to the Knight of the Swan legend which inspired the character &quot;Lohengrin&quot; in Wolfram von Eschenbach&#x27;s &quot;Parzival&quot;.

Jacques Le Goff considered that Melusina represented a fertility figure: &quot;she brings prosperity in a rural area...Melusina is the fairy of medieval economic growth&quot;.

== Other versions ==

=== In France ===

Melusine legends are especially connected with the northern areas of France, Poitou and the Low Countries, as well as Cyprus, where the French Lusignan royal house that ruled the island from 1192 to 1489 claimed to be descended from Melusine. Oblique reference to this was made by Sir Walter Scott who told a Melusine tale in &quot;Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border&quot; (1802–1803) stating that &quot;the reader will find the fairy of Normandy, or Bretagne, adorned with all the splendour of Eastern description&quot;. The fairy Melusina, also, who married Guy de Lusignan, Count of Poitou, under condition that he should never attempt to intrude upon her privacy, was of this latter class. She bore the count many children, and erected for him a magnificent castle by her magical art. Their harmony was uninterrupted until the prying husband broke the conditions of their union, by concealing himself to behold his wife make use of her enchanted bath. Hardly had Melusina discovered the indiscreet intruder, than, transforming herself into a dragon, she departed with a loud yell of lamentation, and was never again visible to mortal eyes; although, even in the days of Brantôme, she was supposed to be the protectress of her descendants, and was heard wailing as she sailed upon the blast round the turrets of the castle of Lusignan the night before it was demolished.

=== In Luxembourg ===
The Counts of Luxembourg also claimed descent from Melusine through their ancestor Siegfried. When in 963 A.D. Count Siegfried of the Ardennes (&quot;Sigefroi&quot; in French; &quot;Sigfrid&quot; in Luxembourgish) bought the feudal rights to the territory on which he founded his capital city of Luxembourg, his name became connected with the local version of Melusine. This Melusina had essentially the same magic gifts as the ancestress of the Lusignans. The morning after their wedding, she magically created the Castle of Luxembourg on the Bock rock (the historical center point of Luxembourg City). On her terms of marriage, she too required one day of absolute privacy each week. Eventually Sigfrid was tempted by curiosity and entered her apartment on Saturday, when he saw her in her bath and discovered her to be a mermaid. He cried out in surprise, and Melusina and her bath sank into the earth. Melusine remained trapped in the rock but returns every seven years either as a woman or a serpent, carrying a golden key in her mouth. Anyone brave enough to take the key will free her and win her as his bride. Also every seven years, Melusine adds a stitch to a linen chemise; if she finishes the chemise before she can be freed, all of Luxembourg will be swallowed by the rock. In 1997, Luxembourg issued a postage stamp commemorating her.

=== In Germany ===
In his Table Talk, Martin Luther mentioned Melusina of Lucelberg (Luxembourg), whom he described as a succubus or the devil. Luther attributed stories like Melusine to the devil appearing in female form to seduce men.

The story of Melusine strongly influenced Paracelsus&#x27;s writings on elementals and especially his description of water spirits. This, in turn, inspired Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué&#x27;s novella &quot;Undine&quot; (1811), and a collaboration on the subject with composer E. T. A. Hoffmann, in which Fouqué wrote the libretto for Hoffman&#x27;s opera &quot;Undine&quot; (1816). Other adaptations and references of Fouqué&#x27;s story are found in works such as Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s fairy tale The Little Mermaid (1837), Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s opera &quot;Rusalka&quot; (1901), and Jean Giraudoux&#x27;s play &quot;Ondine&quot; (1939).

In a legend set in the forest of Stollenwald, a young man meets a beautiful woman named Melusina who has the lower body of a snake. If he will kiss her three times on three consecutive days, she will be freed. However, on each day she becomes more and more monstrous, until the young man flees in terror without giving her the final kisses. He later marries another girl, but the food at their wedding feast is mysteriously poisoned with serpent venom and everyone who eats it dies.

Other Germanic water sprites include Lorelei and the nixie.

=== In Britain ===

Melusine is one of the pre-Christian water-faeries who were sometimes responsible for changelings. The &quot;Lady of the Lake&quot;, who spirited away the infant Lancelot and raised the child, was such a water nymph. 

A folktale tradition of a demon wife similar to Melusine appears in early English literature. According to the chronicler Gerald of Wales, Richard I of England was fond of telling a tale that he was a descendant of an unnamed countess of Anjou. In the legend, an early Count of Anjou encountered a beautiful woman from a foreign land. They were married and had four sons. However, the Count became troubled because his wife only attended church infrequently, and always left in the middle of Mass. One day he had four of his men forcibly restrain his wife as she rose to leave the church. She evaded the men and, in full view of the congregation, flew out of the church through its highest window. She was Melusine, daughter of Satan. She carried her two youngest sons away with her. One of the remaining sons was the ancestor of the later Counts of Anjou, whose violent tempers were the result of their demonic background.

A similar story became attached to his mother Eleanor of Aquitaine, as seen in the 14th-century romance &quot;Richard Coer de Lyon&quot;. In this fantastical account, Henry II&#x27;s wife is not named Eleanor but Cassodorien, and she always leaves Mass before the elevation of the Host. They have three children: Richard (presumably the later King Richard I, &quot;The Lionheart&quot;), John (presumably the later King John), and a daughter named Topyas. When Henry forces Cassodorien to stay in Mass, she flies through the roof of the church carrying her daughter, never to be seen again.

==Related legends==

&quot;The Travels of Sir John Mandeville&quot; recounts a legend about Hippocrates&#x27; daughter. She was transformed into a hundred-foot-long dragon by the goddess Diane, and is the &quot;lady of the manor&quot; of an old castle. She emerges three times a year, and will be turned back into a woman if a knight kisses her, making the knight into her consort and ruler of the islands. Various knights try, but flee when they see the hideous dragon; they die soon thereafter. This appears to be an early version of the legend of Melusine.

The motif of the cursed serpent-maiden freed by a kiss (known as the &quot;fier baiser&quot; (&quot;Proud/Fearsome Kiss&quot;)) also appears in the Arthurian romance entitled Le Bel Inconnu and the Northumbrian ballad of The Laidly Worm of Spindleston Heugh. This motif forms a variant, or subset, of the motif of the Loathly Lady disenchanted, (and thus returned to her comely form) by the action of a hero brave enough to approach her, despite her fearsomely ugly appearance.

* Melusine is the subject of Halévy&#x27;s grand opera &quot;La magicienne&quot; (1858), although the story is greatly altered. Rather than a half-fairy under a curse, Melusine is a witch who has sold her soul to the Devil and is beautiful by day and hideous by night.
* Johann Wolfgang von Goethe reinterpreted the legend in his short story &quot;Die Neue Melusine&quot; (&quot;The New Melusine&quot;) and published it as part of &quot;Wilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre&quot; (1807)&quot;.&quot; In this version, Melusine is a tiny elf who sometimes takes on human size.

In the Guermantes Way, for example, the narrator observes that the Lusignan family &quot;was fated to become extinct on the day when the fairy Melusine should disappear&quot;.
* The story of Melusine (also called Melusina) was retold by Letitia Landon in the poem &quot;The Fairy of the Fountains&quot; in &quot;Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book&quot; and reprinted in her collection &quot;The Zenana&quot;.

This element is repeated in Philippa Gregory&#x27;s novels &quot;The White Queen&quot; (2009) and &quot;The Lady of the Rivers&quot; (2011), but with Jacquetta of Luxembourg telling Elizabeth that their descent from Melusine comes through the Dukes of Burgundy.

<doc id="357676" wikidata="Q1291562" url="?curid=357676" title="Spearthrower Owl">
<text>&quot;Spearthrower Owl&quot; (possibly Jatz&#x27;om Kuy, translating to &quot;Striker Owl&quot;) was a Mesoamerican person from the Early Classic period, who is identified in Maya inscriptions and iconography. Mayanist David Stuart has suggested that Spearthrower Owl was a ruler of Teotihuacan at the start of the height of its influence across Mesoamerica in the 4th and 5th century, and that he was responsible for an intense period of Teotihuacan presence in the Maya area, including the conquest of Tikal in 378 CE.

==Name==

&quot;Spearthrower Owl&quot; is a name invented by archaeologists to describe the Teotihuacan-originated atlatl-holding owl symbol, stylised as one or two Maya glyphs usually used to represent his name.

One version of the ruler&#x27;s name glyph shows a weapon (an atlatl or other type) combined with an owl sign. At Tikal, the name appears written once with phonetic elements, suggesting the Mayan version of the name is &quot;Jatz&#x27;om Kuy&quot;, &quot;striker owl,&quot; or &quot;owl that will strike&quot;. The weapon-owl version is therefore probably the logographs for JATZ&#x27; together with KUY or KUJ.

Various logographs or glyphs depicting an owl and a spear-thrower are documented in Teotihuacan and in the Maya cities of Tikal, Uaxactun, Yaxchilan, and Toniná. They may or may not refer to the same individual, or have other symbolic meanings.

==Biography==

Maya inscriptions at several sites describe the arrival of strangers from the west, depicted with Teotihuacan-style garments and carrying weapons. These arrivals are connected to changes in political leadership at several of the sites.

Stuart noted that the Marcador monument at the Petén Basin center of Tikal records Spearthrower Owlʼs ascension to the throne of an unspecified polity on a date equivalent to 4 May 374 CE. Monuments at El Perú, Tikal and/or Uaxactun describe the arrival of a personage Siyaj Kʼakʼ somehow under the auspices of Spearthrower Owl in the month of January 378. The exact date of his arrival in Tikal is identical with the death of the Tikal ruler, Chak Tok Ichʼaak I. Tikal Stela 31 describes that in 379, a year after the arrival of Siyaj Kʼakʼ at Tikal, Yax Nuun Ahiin, described as a son of Spearthrower Owl and not of the previous ruler Chak Tok Ichʼaak, was installed as king of Tikal. His rule saw the introduction of Teotihuacan-style imagery in the iconography of Tikal. Stela 31 was erected during the reign of Yax Nuun Ahiinʼs son Sihyaj Chan Kʼawil and describes the death of that rulerʼs grandfather, Spearthrower Owl, in 439 CE (Maya date 9.0.3.9.18).

Spearthrower Owl was mentioned in later texts; for example, on a door lintel of Temple I where the Tikal ruler Jasaw Chan Kʼawiil I celebrated the thirteen kʼatun (13x20x360 days) anniversary (in 695 CE) of Spearthrower Owlʼs death when they &quot;conjured the holy one.&quot;

==Interpretations==
The connection of Spearthrower Owl to Teotihuacan as well as the precise nature of Teotihuacanʼs influence on the Maya has been a hotly debated topic since the hieroglyphic texts first became fully readable in the 1990s. The controversy is related to the general discussion of central Mexican influence in the Maya area which was sparked by the findings of Teotihuacan-related objects in the early Maya site of Kaminaljuyú in the 1930s. 

The controversy has two sides. The ʼʼinternalistʼʼ side argues for limited direct contact between Teotihuacan and the Maya area. This side has been represented by epigraphers such as Linda Schele and David Freidel who have argued that the Maya merely had friendly diplomatic relations with Teotihuacan which caused the Maya elite to emulate Teotihuacano culture and ideology. The ʼʼexternalistʼʼ side argues that Teotihuacan was an important factor in the development of Maya culture and politics in the Classic period. This viewpoint was first associated with archaeologist William Sanders who argued for an extreme externalist viewpoint. But as more evidence of direct Teotihuacan influence in the Maya area surged at Copán and new hieroglyphic decipherments by epigraphers such as David Stuart interpreted Teotihuacan incursion as a military invasion, the externalist position was strengthened. In 2003, George Cowgill, an archaeologist specialising in Teotihuacan who had formerly espoused a mostly internalist perspective on Teotihuacan–Maya relations, summarised the debate, conceding that Teotihuacan had probably exercised some kind of political control in the Maya area in the early classic period and that left an important legacy into the late and epi-classic periods.

In 2008 an interpretation of Spearthrower Owl-related iconography at Teotihuacan suggested that Spearthrower Owl was an important military god at Teotihuacan that had his given name to both a place known as &quot;Spearthrower Owl Hill&quot; and to the ruler mentioned in the Maya hieroglyphic texts.

<doc id="357685" wikidata="Q303727" url="?curid=357685" title="Quaternary numeral system">
<text>Quaternary is a numeral system with four as its base. It uses the digits 0, 1, 2, and 3 to represent any real number. Conversion from binary is straightforward.

Four is the largest number within the subitizing range and one of two numbers that is both a square and a highly composite number (the other being thirty-six), making quaternary a convenient choice for a base at this scale. Despite being twice as large, its radix economy is equal to that of binary. However, it fares no better in the localization of prime numbers (the smallest better base being the primorial base six, senary).

Quaternary shares with all fixed-radix numeral systems many properties, such as the ability to represent any real number with a canonical representation (almost unique) and the characteristics of the representations of rational numbers and irrational numbers. See decimal and binary for a discussion of these properties.

==Relation to other positional number systems==
===Relation to binary and hexadecimal===

As with the octal and hexadecimal numeral systems, quaternary has a special relation to the binary numeral system. Each radix four, eight, and sixteen is a power of two, so the conversion to and from binary is implemented by matching each digit with two, three, or four binary digits, or bits. For example, in quaternary,
:2302104 = 10 11 00 10 01 002.
Since sixteen is a power of four, conversion between these bases can be implemented by matching each hexadecimal digit with two quaternary digits. In the above example,
:23 02 104 = B2416

Although octal and hexadecimal are widely used in computing and computer programming in the discussion and analysis of binary arithmetic and logic, quaternary does not enjoy the same status.

Although quaternary has limited practical use, it can be helpful if it is ever necessary to perform hexadecimal arithmetic without a calculator. Each hexadecimal digit can be turned into a pair of quaternary digits. Then, arithmetic can be performed relatively easily before converting the end result back to hexadecimal. Quaternary is convenient for this purpose, since numbers have only half the digit length compared to binary, while still having very simple multiplication and addition tables with only three unique non-trivial elements.

By analogy with &quot;byte&quot; and &quot;nybble&quot;, a quaternary digit is sometimes called a &quot;crumb&quot;.

==Fractions==
Due to having only factors of two, many quaternary fractions have repeating digits, although these tend to be fairly simple:

==Occurrence in human languages==

Many or all of the Chumashan languages (spoken by the Native American Chumash peoples) originally used a quaternary numeral system, in which the names for numbers were structured according to multiples of four and sixteen, instead of ten. There is a surviving list of Ventureño language number words up to thirty-two written down by a Spanish priest ca. 1819.

The Kharosthi numerals (from the languages of the tribes of Pakistan and Afghanistan) have a partial quaternary numeral system from one to ten.

==Hilbert curves==
Quaternary numbers are used in the representation of 2D Hilbert curves. Here, a real number between 0 and 1 is converted into the quaternary system. Every single digit now indicates in which of the respective four sub-quadrants the number will be projected.

==Genetics==

Parallels can be drawn between quaternary numerals and the way genetic code is represented by DNA. The four DNA nucleotides in alphabetical order, abbreviated A, C, G, and T, can be taken to represent the quaternary digits in numerical order 0, 1, 2, and 3. With this encoding, the complementary digit pairs 0↔3, and 1↔2 (binary 00↔11 and 01↔10) match the complementation of the base pairs: A↔T and C↔G and can be stored as data in DNA sequence. For example, the nucleotide sequence GATTACA can be represented by the quaternary number 2033010 (= decimal 9156 or binary 10 00 11 11 00 01 00). The human genome is 3.2 billion base pairs in length.

==Data transmission==
Quaternary line codes have been used for transmission, from the invention of the telegraph to the 2B1Q code used in modern ISDN circuits.

The GDDR6X standard, developed by Nvidia and Micron, uses quaternary bits to transmit data.

==Computing==
Some computers have used quaternary floating point arithmetic including the Illinois ILLIAC II (1962) and the Digital Field System DFS IV and DFS V high-resolution site survey systems.

<doc id="357686" wikidata="Q1262921" url="?curid=357686" title="Pope Alexander II of Alexandria">
<text>Pope Alexander II of Alexandria (Coptic: ⲁⲗⲉⲝⲁⲛⲇⲣⲟⲥ; died 14 February 729) was the 43rd Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of the See of St. Mark.

He presided over his church during an era of great hardship and oppression.

==Consecration==
There is little information available on Alexander&#x27;s early life as a layman prior to becoming a monk at the monastery of the Enaton west of Alexandria. However, at the Enaton he became well known for his chastity, sanctity, and religious scholarship. Upon the death of Simeon of Alexandria in 701, the Patriarchate of Alexdandria remained vacant for approximately four years, while the members of the church sought an appropriate successor. The lack of a patriarch, though, created economic problems for the church, so the secretary of state, or &quot;mutawallī al-diwān&quot; in Alexandria, a Copt named Athanasius, asked the governor to allow the bishop of al-Qays, Anbā Gregorius, to assume authority over the church&#x27;s finances until a new patriarch would be elected. The governor, Abd al-Malik agreed, which allowed the selection of a patriarch to take top priority. Athanasius gathered together all the Coptic scribes, clergy, and bishops, and the group unanimously selected Alexander based on his sterling reputation. Alexander was then taken to Alexandria to be consecrated.

==Patriarchate==
Alexander&#x27;s patriarchate occurred under several Umayyad caliphs, whose positions on the Copts varied greatly. These included Abd al-Malik, Al-Walid I, Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik, Umar II, Yazid II, and Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik. This period included the Siege of Constantinople, which had a serious economic impact on the economy of Egypt. The failure at Constantinople, coupled with the financial strains brought about by the Al-Zubayr rebellion, made the Caliphs look to Egypt as the closest source of funds from which to prop themselves up economically.

===Political problems===
The confiscatory taxing started when Abd al-Malik chose to name his son Al-Walid I as his successor. Al-Walid constantly demanded revenues from the Egyptian people. He also employed a native Copt named Benjamin who assisted him in locating where the people had hidden their wealth, which would then be confiscated by the government. He also raised the jizya well beyond any normal rates, and, for the first time in history, imposed it on the monks as well. He also imposed an additional tax of 2000 dinars above the normal rate of kharaj taxation on every bishop. The extreme financial pressures these taxes imposed on the Copts caused many to convert to Islam to escape them. These feigned converts included such figures as Buṭrus, the viceroy of Upper Egypt, Buṭrus&#x27; brother Theodosius, and son Theophanes, the governor of Mareotis.

Al-Walid did not limit himself to taxing the Copts&#x27; finances; he also taxed their patience. He publicly reviled Jesus and once, during a procession, he even spat in the face of an image of the Virgin Mary. When the Copts protested to the Caliph about the level of taxation he responded with more seizure of property and higher taxes. Such behavior continued under Al-Walid&#x27;s successors. He went so far as to seize gold and silver utensils used in church services, and even several pillars and carved wood sculptures, from the churches, and use them for profane purposes.

===Branding===
Things improved, if only financially, for Alexander and the Copts under Umar II, but the accession of Yazid II after him made things even worse than they had been under Al-Walid. Yazid not only reinstated all the earlier taxes, he also ordered the destruction of all crosses and sacred images in churches. He also ordered all his subjects to wear a leaden identification badge around their necks, and required that all Copts who wished to engage in business activity have the mark of a lion branded on their hands. Anyone caught without the mark would have his hand cut off. This ongoing and escalating abuse of the people by their government instilled a rebellious mood in the Copts, and several local revolts broke out against the government.

When the government decided that Alexander, as patriarch, must submit to being branded with the lion as well, he protested and asked that he be allowed to plead his case before the viceroy himself. Alexander was taken to Fustat with a special military bodyguard. However, when he arrived at the capital, the viceroy refused to see him, and Alexander was forced to remain in Fustat.

==Death==
While in Fustat his health declined. With the help of Anbā Shamūl, the bishop of Awsim, Alexander determined to escape and return to Alexandria by ship. On reaching Tarnūt, with the governor&#x27;s soldiers in pursuit, Alexander died. When they found the dead patriarch the soldiers seized Anbā Shamūl and took him back to Fustat, where he was found complicit in Alexander&#x27;s escape and fined 1000 dinars. With the assistance of the Copts, who raised 300 dinars for him, he was able to raise the money and be released.

Alexander&#x27;s body was taken back to Alexandria, where he was buried with the profound grief of his people.

==Veneration==
Alexander is regarded as a saint by the Coptic Church, and also has a feast day on February 1 in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.

<text>The originally German Oekonux (pronounced &quot;urkonooks&quot;) project was founded to research the possibilities of free software to fundamentally change the current political and economic structures.

Oekonux considers that the mode of production of free software represents a new mode of production that has the potential to supersede the capitalist mode of production. 

See also Hipatia , a related Spanish language initiative.

==History of the project==

At the first „Wizards of OS“ conference in July 1999 a spontaneous discussion round was founded after the panel „New Economy?“. Thereupon a mailinglist was created to continue the exchange—Oekonux was founded. A website to publish texts and to access mailinglist archives, and a wiki followed soon.

In April 2001 the first Oekonux conference was organized in Dortmund followed by a second conference in November 2002 in Berlin. The third conference took place in Vienna in May 2004, where Creative Commons Austria was launched. A fourth conference was held in Manchester in March 2009 in cooperation with P2P Foundation.

The project launched a journal entitled „Critical Studies in Peer Production“ in 2011. After releasing one issue, the journal editors separated from Oekonux and relaunched the journal under the name „Journal of Peer Production“.

<text>Air France–KLM S.A., also known as Air France–KLM Group, is a French-Dutch multinational airline holding company with its headquarters in the rue du Cirque, Paris, France. The group’s three major brands are Air France, KLM and Transavia. Air France-KLM is the result of the merger in 2004 between Air France and KLM. Both Air France and KLM are members of the SkyTeam airline alliance. The group&#x27;s main hubs are Paris–Charles de Gaulle Airport, Paris Orly Airport and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. Air France-KLM airlines transported 83 million passengers in 2022.

==History==
=== 2004: Founding ===
On 5 May 2004, Air France-KLM was created by the mutually agreed merger between Air France and Netherlands-based KLM. As a result of the deal, the French government&#x27;s share of Air France was reduced from 54.4% (of the former Air France) to 44% (of the combined airline). Its share was subsequently reduced to 25%, and later to 17.6%. At the time of the merger in May 2004, Air France and KLM combined offered flights to 225 destinations in the world. In the year ending 21 March 2003, the two companies combined transported 66.3 million passengers.

In October 2005, Air France Cargo and KLM Cargo, the two freight subsidiaries of the group, merged their commercial activities. The Joint Cargo Management Team now operates the organisation worldwide from the Netherlands.

In a 2007 opening for a majority takeover of the loss-generating Alitalia, Air France-KLM was one of three bidders, and was favoured by the board of Alitalia. However, on 2 April 2008, it was reported that negotiations have been abandoned. After the acquisition of Alitalia and Air One by Compagnia Aerea Italiana on 12 December 2008, Air France-KLM was interested once again in purchasing a participation in the new merged company. On 12 January 2009, Air France-KLM bought a 25% share in this company for €323 million.

In 2008, it was the largest airline company in the world in terms of total operating revenues, and also the largest in the world in terms of international passenger-kilometres.

=== 2010: Japan Airlines bid ===
Air France-KLM, along with its partner Delta Air Lines, were in talks about investing with Japan Airlines, which is part of the Oneworld alliance (rival to SkyTeam) but was experiencing financial problems. Air France-KLM, along with Delta and Delta&#x27;s rival, American Airlines (AMR Corporation, part of Oneworld), discussed investments of $200–300 million to help the financially struggling carrier, which is Asia&#x27;s largest airline by revenue. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of Japan had recommended Air France-KLM and/or Delta for partners because of their &quot;healthy&quot; financial status, compared to AMR Corporation. Delta was also recommended because of its extensive Asian network, acquired through the acquisition of Northwest Airlines. Korean Air, also a SkyTeam member, was also in talks with JAL. Air France, Alitalia, China Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Korean Air, and Vietnam Airlines are SkyTeam members that currently have code-sharing with JAL. On 7 February 2010 several news outlets reported that JAL decided to keep its alliance with American Airlines and end talks with Delta. According to reports, new JAL CEO Inamori and ETIC officials, decided that switching alliances (from Oneworld to SkyTeam) would be too risky and could hinder JAL&#x27;s ability to turn around the airline quickly. On 9 February 2010, JAL officially announced their decision to strengthen its partnership with American, which included the joint application of antitrust immunity approval on transpacific routes. The airline also planned to fortify its relationship with other partners in the Oneworld alliance.

=== 2010–2019: Stability ===
In February 2011, Air France-KLM and Delta Air Lines were working together to examine a bid for Virgin Atlantic as Richard Branson had a 51 percent stake and the rest is held by Delta.

In August 2011, Air France-KLM was categorized as one of World&#x27;s 10 safest airlines.

In December 2013, Air France-KLM sold its subsidiary CityJet to Intro Aviation.

In early April 2016, Alexandre de Juniac, Chairman and CEO since 1 July 2013 resigned and was replaced by Jean-Marc Janaillac on 4 July 2016.

In January 2018, before the French Senate, Jean-Marc Janaillac reported for 2017 a higher revenue due to a rising fleet utilisation and a faster growth to come, and a better operating profit with 6% for the group (Air France 4%, KLM 9%) but lagging the 9% of Lufthansa and 10 to 12% of British Airways, while he deplored Paris-Charles de Gaulle luggage handling and safety waiting lines, obstructing connections, and anticipating a difficult 2018 with rising jet fuel prices and competition from Gulf carriers, Turkish Airlines, Chinese and Asian airlines, and low-cost carriers, either easyJet, Volotea, Ryanair or long haul.

At the end of 2018, Air France-KLM will select its medium-haul fleet replacement for Air France, HOP!, KLM and Transavia, operating 120 Boeing 737 NG, 118 Airbus A320ceo family, 64 Embraer E-Jets, 25 Bombardier CRJ700 series and 13 Embraer 145. After renewing its long-haul fleet with the 787 Dreamliner and the A350 XWB from 2019, specifications will be released in the first trimester, seeking proposals from Airbus, Boeing, Bombardier Aerospace and Embraer, aiming for lower aircraft noise and biofuel usage.

On 4 May 2018, Jean-Marc Janaillac announced that he will be resigning as CEO of Air France-KLM, after employees rejected new salary package.

On 16 August 2018, the Board of Directors of Air France-KLM announced the appointment of Benjamin Smith as new CEO. He took up his duties at Air France-KLM on 30 September 2018.

On 26 February 2019, the Dutch government announced that it had &quot;purchased 12.68 percent of shares in Air France-KLM&quot; and &quot;plans to build up its stake to around 14 percent&quot;.

=== 2022–2024: CMA CGM alliance, Scandinavian Airlines investment ===
In May 2022, Air France-KLM signed a strategic partnership with CMA CGM to develop their air cargo capacities together. CMA CGM is the parent company of CMA CGM Air Cargo which was founded in 2021. As part of the agreement CMA CGM acquired a 9% stake in AF-KLM; however, this agreement was terminated by mutual agreement in January 2024 without change in the capital structure of the group.

On 12 July 2023, Air France-KLM announced a 10-for-1 reverse stock split and an ISIN change on 31 August 2023. 

In October 2023, Air France-KLM, the Danish state and two investment firms (Castlelake and Lind Invest) announced plans to invest in Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) following the airline&#x27;s ongoing Chapter 11 process in the United States, with the carrier taking 19.9% stake (and plans to increase in the future). In March 2024, the US Bankruptcy Court approved the restructuring plan that would allow SAS to exit Chapter 11 proceedings with approval from the European Commission following on 28 June 2024. Following the approval for the investment, SAS exited Star Alliance on 31 August 2024, and joined SkyTeam on 1 September 2024

==Corporate affairs==

===Business trends===
In May 2010, Air France-KLM announced increased losses (€1.56 billion for the year to 31 March 2010), and warned that the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull had caused a further €160 million loss in the current financial year. Air France-KLM is one of the largest airline companies in Europe, with 204.7 billion passenger-km in the year ending 31 March 2011.

Private shareholders own 81.4% of the company with 37% held by former Air France shareholders and 21% held by former KLM shareholders. The Government of France owns the remaining 15.9%.

In June 2008, Air France-KLM agreed to pay $350 million to settle charges of cargo price fixing in an investigation conducted by the U.S. Justice Department. Cathay Pacific, Martinair Holland, and SAS Cargo Group also agreed to fines bringing the total to $504 million. In November 2010, the European Commission fined Air France-KLM €310 million following another price-fixing investigation.

The company spends about a third of its revenue on staff, its biggest expense, while Lufthansa only spends around a quarter, so to save around 800 million euros (app. 1.04 billion US$) annually over the next three years, the company will make a recruitment freeze which will lead to 2,000 job cuts in 2012.

In February 2014, Air-France KLM invested $100 million in Brazilian airline Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes in advance of the 2014 football World Cup.

During 2015, Air France went through a severe business crisis and a pilot&#x27;s strike, which made the French airline cut almost 3,000 jobs, KLM defer some of its pending 787 deliveries, KLM&#x27;s cargo subsidiary Martinair to retire six McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 airplanes, and Air France-KLM to suffer as a company.

On 27 November, 2024 Air France-KLM has been seen to have talks to buys a stake of 20% in Spanish Airline Europa. 

The transaction is said to be worth more than €100 million and it wouldn’t require the European Union’s regulatory nod, however, Air France has termed it to be commercial cooperation that are underway.

<text>The Geometric Centre of Slovenia (, GEOSS) is the geometric centre of the country. Its geographic coordinates are and its elevation is 644.842m. It lies in the hamlet of Spodnja Slivna near Vače in the Municipality of Litija. Since 4July1982, it has been marked with a memorial stone designed by the architect Marjan Božič, about 50m away from the given coordinates. A plaque reading &quot;Živimo in gospodarimo na svoji zemlji&quot; (&#x27;We live and prosper upon our land&#x27;) was added on 14September1989. In 2003, Slovenia adopted the Geometric Centre of Slovenia Act, which is a unique case in Europe.

<text>Janahb Pakal also known as Janaab Pakal, Pakal I or Pakal the Elder, (died 6 March 612), was a nobleman and possible &quot;ajaw&quot; of the Maya city-state of Palenque.

== Biography ==
Pakal’s dynastic position is not entirely certain, though he may have been the grandfather or brother of Ajen Yohl Mat. It seems that he never ascended to the high-kingship in his own right. He was the father of Lady Sak Kʼukʼ, one of the rare queens regnant of Maya history. His wife or mother was Yohl Ikʼnal. During reign of his probable brother Ajen Yohl Mat, Palenque was invaded on April 4, 611 by Scroll Serpent, ruler of the Kaan kingdom (Calakmul). They were dead c. sixteen months later. In later years, he is ascribed a full emblem glyph. He should not be confused with his grandson, Kʼinich Janaabʼ Pakal who during a long reign of some 68 years was responsible for the construction or extension of some of Palenque’s most notable surviving inscriptions and monumental architecture.

<text>Antoine (22 April 1518 – 17 November 1562), sometimes called Antoine of Bourbon, was King of Navarre from 1555 until his death in 1562 as the husband and co-ruler of Queen Jeanne III. He was the first monarch of the House of Bourbon, of which he became head in 1537. Despite being first prince of the blood in France, Navarre lacked political influence and was dominated by King Henry II of France&#x27;s favourites, the Montmorency and Guise families. When Henry II died in 1559, Navarre found himself sidelined in the Guise-dominated government, and then compromised by his brother&#x27;s treason. When Henry&#x27;s son, King Francis II of France, soon died in turn, Navarre returned to the centre of politics, becoming Lieutenant-General of France and leading the army of the crown in the first of the French Wars of Religion. He died of wounds sustained during the Siege of Rouen. He was the father of King Henry IV, France&#x27;s first Bourbon king.

==Early life==

Antoine of Bourbon was born at La Fère, Picardy, France, the second son of Charles of Bourbon, Duke of Vendôme (1489–1537), and his wife, Françoise d&#x27;Alençon (died 1550). He was the older brother of Louis of Bourbon, Prince of Condé, who would lead the Huguenots during the early French Wars of Religion.

==Reign of Henri II and Francis II==

=== Henri II ===
Antoine found himself in a disadvantageous position in the court of Henri, due to the disgrace that had befallen his house after the defection of Charles III, Duke of Bourbon to Charles V in 1523. Regardless, he was able to secure the kingship of Navarre jure uxoris in 1555. In the same year the critical border governorship of Picardy was removed from him and given to Admiral Coligny arousing significant protest. However, he was bought off with the rich southern governorship of Guyenne. In 1556, upon hearing that Jacques, Duke of Nemours had made his cousin-by-marriage pregnant, he threatened bloody consequences for Savoie and his family, causing the man to take the excuse of a campaign into Italy to leave France. In February 1557, Navarre, Jeanne and their son Henry travelled to the French court in Paris; while there Henri suggested a betrothal between his daughter Margaret and Henry. Desiring to reverse the Spanish occupation of much of his kingdom, he entered into negotiations with Charles V; however these went nowhere and compromised his position at court still further. Navarre demonstrated early sympathy towards the reformation, corresponding with the Genevan pastor Boisnormand as early as 1557, and providing protection to the Huguenot church of Guyenne in 1558 through his capacity as governor. In 1558 he attended the psalm singing at the &quot;Pré-aux-Clercs&quot; to the considerable fury of Henri. He fought for the crown in the last stage of the Italian wars in 1558. The Huguenot leadership were animated by the prospect of bringing Navarre into their camp causing Calvin and Beza to devote considerable efforts to the project.

=== Francis II ===
When in 1559 king Henri died, opponents of the Guise, including Anne de Montmorency flocked to meet Navarre in Vendôme hoping he would establish himself in the government. The Guise were however able to neutralise him by buying him off with the governorship of Poitou and sent him off to escort Elisabeth of Valois to the Spanish border. In 1560, the organisers of the Amboise conspiracy tried to recruit him as a figurehead for their efforts against the Guise government, but Navarre was apathetic. After the failure of Amboise, unrest continued in the south of France; Navarre&#x27;s brother Condé intrigued concerning an uprising in Lyon, with plans to send 1200 men in support. His letter on the matter was intercepted by the Guise, however, and both brothers were summoned to court in August for an Assembly of Notables. Condé and Navarre were the only grandees not to attend, and thus played no part in that assembly&#x27;s calling of an estates general. To further isolate Navarre, Condé and the house of Bourbon-Vendôme, the Guise created two super governorships, giving them to their cousins Charles, Prince of La Roche-sur-Yon and Louis, Duke of Montpensier, separating the princes of blood from each other. On 31 August the Guise wrote Navarre they had 40,000 troops ready to move into the south, and to present themselves at court. Navarre and Condé, possessing only around 6000 troops, were unable to resist, and came north without a fight. Upon their arrival Condė was detained and sentenced.

==Reign of Charles IX==
===Death of Francis===
In December 1560 the young Francis II died and was succeeded by his brother Charles IX. Charles, being too young to rule, required a regent, a position Navarre was entitled to as first prince of the blood. Catherine however possessed considerable leverage over him due to the imprisonment of his brother Condé for treason. The two agreed that in exchange for Catherine being regent, Navarre would become Lieutenant General of the kingdom and Condé would be brought back into favour.

===Collapse of the regency===
Navarre found himself increasingly in opposition to the religious policy of Catherine&#x27;s administration, finally breaking with her concerning the Edict of Saint-Germain, writing urgently to Guise to return to court so they could present a united front against the edict. On his way to Paris, Guise&#x27;s men committed the Massacre of Vassy, plunging France into civil war. Navarre in his role as Lieutenant General would be the supreme commander of the crown&#x27;s forces in the coming conflict.

===First French War of Religion and death===
In May he issued a decree expelling all Protestants from Paris, much to the delight of radicals in the capital. His army and that of Condé faced off against each other in June near Orléans. The sides only came to light skirmishing however, as negotiations between the sides to avoid bloodshed continued. With Condé now retreating, Navarre and the other leaders began retaking rebel towns, capturing Blois, Tours and Amboise. In August the main royal force under Navarre besieged and overcame the rebel garrison in the key town of Bourges. When his wife, Jeanne d&#x27;Albret, allowed the Huguenots to sack the chapel and the churches of Vendôme, he threatened to send her to a convent. Having taken Bourges, the royal army was faced with a choice, to march on the Huguenot capital of Orléans immediately, or first strike at the northern town of Rouen, which Aumale was currently unsuccessfully trying to besiege with his small force. Navarre wanted to immediately push on Orlėans, but the plague in the town, the threat of the English, and the hopes of Catherine that he might yet prevail on his brother to abandon rebellion, persuaded the court against this policy. Navarre&#x27;s army invested the city of Rouen on 28 September and began trying to subdue the town. On 13 October, while inspecting the siege trenches, Navarre was mortally wounded by a musket shot to the shoulder. Despite the efforts of the famed surgeon Ambroise Paré, he could not be saved, and died of his wounds on 17 November. It was rumoured that his last rites were taken in the Lutheran custom, compounding long-held suspicions of his religious unorthodoxy.

==Marriage and children==

On 20 October 1548, at Moulins, Antoine married Jeanne d&#x27;Albret, the daughter of Henry II of Navarre and his wife Marguerite de Navarre. After his father-in-law&#x27;s death in May 1555, he became King of Navarre, Count of Foix, of Bigorre, of Armagnac, of Périgord, and Viscount of Béarn. It was reported that Jeanne was much in love with him. His reconversion to Catholicism separated him from his wife and he threatened to repudiate her.

Antoine and Jeanne had:

* Henry (1551–1553), Duke of Beaumont
* Henry IV of France (1553–1610)
* Louis (1555–1557), Count of Marle
* Madeleine (1556–1556)
* Catherine (1559–1604), married Henry II, Duke of Lorraine in 1599

With his mistress, Louise de La Béraudière de l&#x27;Isle Rouhet, Antoine had:
*Charles, Archbishop of Rouen from 1554 until 1610.

<text>The First $20 Million Is Always the Hardest is a 2002 film based on the novel of the same name by technology-culture writer Po Bronson. The film stars Adam Garcia and Rosario Dawson. The screenplay was written by Jon Favreau and Gary Tieche.

==Plot==
Andy Kasper is a marketer who quits his job in search of something more fulfilling. He gets hired at LaHonda Research Institute, where Francis Benoit assigns him to design the PC99, a $99 PC. He moves into a run-down boarding house where he meets his neighbor Alisa, an artist. He puts together a team of unassigned LaHonda employees. The team includes: Salman Fard, a short, foreign man with an accent who is hacking into CIA files when Andy meets him; Curtis &quot;Tiny&quot; Russell, a massively obese, anthropophobic man; and Darrell, a tall, blond, pierced, scary, germaphobic, deep-voiced man with personal space issues who regularly refers to himself in the third person.

The team finds many non-essential parts but cannot come close to the $99 mark. It is Salman&#x27;s idea to put all the software on the internet, eliminating the need for a hard drive, RAM, a CD-ROM drive, a floppy drive, and anything that holds information. The computer has been reduced to a microprocessor, a monitor, a mouse, a keyboard, and the internet, but it is still too expensive. Having seen the rest of his team watching a hologram of an attractive lady the day before, in a dream Andy is inspired to eliminate the monitor in favor of the cheaper holographic projector. The last few hundred dollars come off when Darrell suggests using virtual reality gloves in place of a mouse and keyboard. Tiny then writes a &quot;hypnotizer&quot; code to link the gloves, the projector, and the internet, and they&#x27;re done.

But immediately before he finishes, the whole team (except for Tiny, who is still writing the code) quits LaHonda after being told that there are no more funds for their project, but sign a non-exclusive patent waiver, meaning that LaHonda will share the patent rights to any technology they had developed up to that point. After leaving LaHonda, they pitch their product to numerous companies, but do not get accepted, mainly because the prototype emagi (electronic magic) was ugly, and something always seemed to go wrong during the demonstration of their product.

Alisa, whose relationship with Andy has been growing steadily, helps improve the emagi&#x27;s looks, which helps the team with their callback with executive. They agree to give her 51% of their company in exchange for getting their product manufactured and for getting Andy&#x27;s Porsche bought back, which he had had to sell in order to raise money to build a new emagi after leaving LaHonda. Unfortunately, she then sells the patent rights to the emagi to Francis Benoit, who plans to sell the emagi at $999 a piece and reap a huge profit.

The team interrupts the meeting in which Benoit is going to introduce the emagi to the world and introduces an even newer computer he and his team developed and manufactured at LaHonda, which was in a state of disaster when they arrived. It was a small silver tube that projected a hologram and lasers which would detect where the hands were, eliminating the need even for virtual reality gloves. Andy then reminds Benoit of the non-exclusive patent waiver, which had been Benoit&#x27;s idea in the first place.

<text>The Baptist Conference of the Philippines is a Baptist Christian denomination in the Philippines. It is affiliated with the Baptist World Alliance.

Its headquarters is 910 A.S. Fortuna St., Banilad, Mandaue, Cebu 6014.

==History==
Work began in 1949 with five Baptist General Conference missionaries in Cebu. In June 1950, the Baptist General Conference (BGC) Foreign Mission Board declared Northern Cebu as the area where the BGC missionary work was to begin. BCP is the direct result of the mission endeavor of the Baptist General Conference in the United States. Agnes Erikson was the first BGC missionary to the Philippines, sailing from San Francisco, California on 9 December 1948. A year later, two missionary families headed by Andrew Nelson and Irwin Bjelland followed, sailing from San Francisco on 30 October 1949 and arriving in Manila on 20 November 1949.

Initial results of their work are as follows:
&quot;At the end of February 1950, Andrew Nelson reported 5 services were being conducted on Sundays near Bogo, while Irwin Bjelland reported on May 7, 1950 letter, the first Sunday service had been held.&quot; Another group was organized in the town of Catmon marked by k.m 57. The place was situated between Cebu City and Bogo. The couples Eufrosino Ares and Paterna Comain became language teachers who could speak English very well. They assisted the Hughs, Osbrons, Chesbro&#x27;s and later the Chalmers family who actually lived in the place. Mr. Ares became the first chairman of the newly formed school board of Baptist Bible School tasked to help manage the 24 hec. property for the school site situated in the northern end of Cebu. Although, he did not become a pastor upon invitation due to the large family he had to support, he became involved through his profession as a teacher and his farming skills in the conception of the early missionary endeavour.&quot;

The concrete result of the mission work occurred in June 1952, when the first baptismal service was held. B-Etta Mayer gave this report of the event:
&quot;The six candidates included a promising preacher and his sister. On the shore were jeering mocking, scornful friends, relatives and casual observers.&quot; 
Of these six, two now are still in active service: Rev. Cresenciano Batuto, Pastor Emeritus of Grace Baptist Church of Gigatangan in Naval, Biliran; and Mrs. Jacinta Batuto Sarcos, the widow of BTC President Rev. Eliseo Sarcos.

In 1954, there were small Baptist churches in Bogo with 54 baptised members, and on 6 June 1954 the three churches entered into fellowship as the Cebu Baptist Association (CBA). In 1965, the CBA constitution was amended, renaming the body to Baptist Conference of the Philippines (BCP). The change was driven by fact that mission work had expanded beyond Cebu island, as churches and mission points have already been established in neighbouring provinces in the Visayas.

The creation of the BCP concretised the identity of a national organisation, which developed from a simple organization into a more complex entity. As the BCP grew in number of churches and members, its area of ministry widened. Leaders too in local churches, districts and the national organization developed. This necessitated a clarification of role in its relationship with the &quot;mother organization&quot;, the BGCPM, resulting in a series of consultations, which gave birth to a partnership.

BGCPM and BCP now became partners in working together to accomplish God&#x27;s purposes. The ultimate goal is always a strong and self-propagating family of Baptist churches. Rev. Marwin Linstedt wrote:
&quot;This partnership, however, is constantly updated. Times change. So do people. The original leadership gives way to next generation. The strategies of the 1950s and 1960s serve their purposes and yield to approaches that are more relevant to the 1970s and 1980s. The Philippines is a rapidly urbanizing society. During the nearly forty years covered in this story, the population of the country more than triples. Old values give way to new ones. An entirely new generation of Filipinos moves into leadership in the nation and in the churches.&quot;

According to a census published by the association in 2023, it claimed 35,000 members and 430 churches.

==The BCP and the Mission-in-Dialogue==
&quot;At the end of the decade of the 1960s drew nearer, the need to evaluate the relationship between the BCP and the BGC mission became obvious to all concerned. The BCP would be making its 15th anniversary in 1969. During that year the mission would be 20 years old. By and large, both bodies had been working harmoniously over these years. However, strains and misunderstanding were beginning to appear. In a way this was to be expected. The relationship of the BCP leadership to the missionaries was cross-cultural in nature. In the formative stages of the work, the mission had naturally played a leading role, and the Filipino leadership was willing to cooperate and learn. Most of the pastors and BCP trustees had worked closely with the missionaries, and had been well trained at BTC. The ways and ideas of the missionaries were well known to them, not only strengths but also their weaknesses.&quot;

The emerging leadership of the BCP feeling that it was time to do so strongly exerted its right to be heard. This resulted in a series of consultation, resulting in the creation of the Joint Work Program (JWP).

&quot;The JWP was designed to be a mechanism of coordination and administration for the common ministries of the BCP and the BGCPM. The general goals were started to be:
#Communicating the Gospel to as many as possible
#Winning souls to Jesus Christ
#Establishing local churches
#Strengthening existing churches
#Training Christians for leadership on all levels
#Developing a strong and growing BCP

===Five areas of cooperating ministry were agreed upon===
#Evangelism and church planting
#Administration of JWP budget; revolving funds and church grant funds
#Christian Education
#Publishing and distributing Christian literature and;
#The Baptist Theological College

The JWP was originally designed to be a 15-year program in three phases leading to a fully self-sustaining, self-propagating, and missions minded BCP:
Phase 1 – was to last for 5 years, concentrating on promoting church growth
Phase 2 – was to last for 7 years. The emphasis was to train and expand BCP leadership together with continuing growth.
Phase 3 – was to last 3 years, which BCP leadership would be consolidated in preparation for withdrawal of the BGC Mission participation on the board.

&quot;In actual practice, the JWP was in effect only in 1971 to 1977. By 1976, the Joint Policy Council had concluded that Phase 2 and Phase 3 were not necessary as programmed (We need to implement Phase 2 and 3). BCP was growing rapidly and capable leaders were available. The probability that it had passed was considered to be excellent. On the negative side, the administrative machinery of the JWP was cumbersome and time consuming for those served on the boards. A simpler and more flexible working relationship was needed.

In March 1977, a draft of the general agreement between the Baptist Conference of the Philippines and the Baptist General Conference Philippine Mission was ready for the study and action of the two organizations. In essence, this agreement laid down the guidelines by which the BCP and the Mission would &quot;cooperate and work together for the attainment of the purposes, goals and objectives of the BCP as stated in its constitutions.&quot; The duration of the agreement came to be known throughout the BCP as &quot;Ten Year Agreement&quot;.

The Ten Year Agreement was replaced by the BGC-BGCPM new agreement of 1986. This was approved during the 29th Annual Conference (Fourth Biennial Assembly) held at First Baptist Church, Cebu City on April 15–18, 1986. The new agreement of 1986 featured for the first time all Filipino Board composed of 11 members, 8 of them representing each BCP district. Three were chosen at large. up to the present BCP has a total of 12 districts.

==Programs==

===Church Planting Program===
The partnership between the BCP and the BGCPM resulted in the formulation of church planting strategies in order to reach the common goals of both organizations. The first church planting program launched was the . . .

===&quot;Objective Ten Thousand&quot;===
This program visioned a goal of 10,000 members BCP wide, from a base of 3,500 members on December 31, 1980 to December 1985. Record shows that BCP fall short of its goal; however, during this 5-year period 3,859 new members were added while the number of churches reached 126 congregations.

===&quot;Double In Four&quot;===
This program had a goal of doubling the number of churches in four years time, beginning in 1986 to 1990. Under the all-Filipino leadership, it was not able to take off due to non-functioning of its chairman. Handicapped by the lack of functioning ministries, the program was still implemented through the initiative of local churches, the districts and the national office through the BOT.

===&quot;Operation 4-4-4&quot;===
This program targets 400 churches in 4 years from 1990 to 1994. This program never took off due to lack of financial resources and personnel in order to implement the program.

Some BCP churches are now involved in cross-cultural missions by sending and supporting 40 missionaries to 12 countries. After 50 years of BCP ministry the era has come for BCP to become a missionary sending denomination instead of being a missionary receiving denomination.

&quot;Decade of Change&quot;
BCP is aggressively implementing a church planting movement to reach out the middle class of the Philippine society from 2007 to 2014 with the goal to plant 60 churches.

<doc id="357719" wikidata="Q903961" url="?curid=357719" title="Smothered mate">
<text>In chess, a smothered mate is a checkmate delivered by a knight in which the mated king is unable to move because it is completely surrounded (or &quot;smothered&quot;) by its own pieces, which a knight can jump over.

The mate is usually seen in a corner of the board, since only three pieces are needed to surround the king there, less than anywhere else. The most common form of smothered mate is seen in the adjacent diagram. The knight on f7 delivers mate to the king on h8, which is prevented from escaping the check by the rook on g8 and the pawns on g7 and h7. Similarly, White can be mated with the white king on h1 and the knight on f2. Analogous mates on a1 and a8 are rarer because castling is more common than castling and brings the king closer to the corner.
==Methods==
For a smothered mate to occur in a game, it is usually necessary to sacrifice to compel pieces to smother the king – a player is unlikely to voluntarily surround their king with pieces in a way that makes a smothered mate possible.

===Philidor&#x27;s mate===

Philidor&#x27;s mate, also known as Philidor&#x27;s legacy, is a checkmating pattern that ends in smothered mate. This method involves checking with the knight forcing the king out of the corner of the board, moving the knight away to deliver a double check from the queen and knight, sacrificing the queen to force the rook next to the king, and mating with the knight.

The technique is named after François-André Danican Philidor; this is something of a misnomer, however, as it is earlier described in Luis Ramirez Lucena&#x27;s 1497 text on chess, &quot;Repetición de Amores e Arte de Axedrez&quot;, which predates Philidor by several hundred years.

An example is to be found in the game Jan Timman–Nigel Short at the 1990 Tilburg tournament. From the diagrammed position, play continued 27. Nf7+ Kg8 28. Nh6+ Kh8 29. Qg8+ Rxg8 30. Nf7#. (Note that White would force mate even if his rook, and pawn on e7, were removed from the board, and Black had a knight on f6. In that case, 27.Nf7+ Kg8 28.Nh6+ Kh8 [28...Kf8 29.Qf7#] 29.Qg8+ Nxg8 [or 29...Rxg8] 30.Nf7 still mates.)

===Opening traps===

Occasionally, a smothered mate may be possible in the opening of a game. One of the most famous, and most frequently occurring, is in the Budapest Gambit. It arises after 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e5 3. dxe5 Ng4 4. Bf4 Nc6 5. Nf3 Bb4+ 6. Nbd2 Qe7 7. a3 Ngxe5 8. axb4?? Nd3# (see diagram). Note that the knight cannot be taken because the pawn on e2 is pinned to the white king by the black queen on e7. 
Another notorious example is the so-called &quot;Blackburne Shilling Gambit&quot; (named after the 19th-century English player Joseph Henry Blackburne, supposedly because he used it to win shillings from amateurs). It goes: 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bc4 Nd4?! 4. Nxe5!? Qg5! 5. Nxf7?? Qxg2 6. Rf1 Qxe4+ 7. Be2 Nf3# (see diagram). There is also a well-known trap in the Caro–Kann Defence: 1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nd7 5. Qe2!? Ngf6?? 6. Nd6#. This trap has occurred in many games, perhaps the earliest recorded example being Alekhine–Four Amateurs, simultaneous exhibition, Palma de Mallorca 1935.
==Examples from games==

An example of a similar smothered mate in master-level play is the game Edward Lasker–Israel Horowitz, New York City 1946, which went: 1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3. e3 c5 4. c4 cxd4 5. Nxd4 e5 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Nc3 d4 8. exd4 exd4 9. Nb5 Bb4+ 10. Bd2 0-0 11. Bxb4 Nxb4 12. Nbxd4 Qa5 13. Nd2 Qe5+ 14. Ne2 Nd3#.

Another example is the game Unzicker–Sarapu, Siegen Olympiad 1970: 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. e5 Nd5 4. Nc3 e6 5. Nxd5 exd5 6. d4 Nc6 7. dxc5 Bxc5 8. Qxd5 Qb6 9. Bc4 Bxf2+ 10. Ke2 0-0 11. Rf1 Bc5 12. Ng5 Nd4+ 13. Kd1 Ne6 14. Ne4 d6 15. exd6 Bxd6?? 16. Nxd6 Rd8 17. Bf4! Nxf4? 18. Qxf7+ Kh8 19. Qg8+! Sarapu now resigned in light of 19...Rxg8 20.Nf7#.

<doc id="357723" wikidata="Q9012072" url="?curid=357723" title="Joan Sebastian">
<text>José Manuel Figueroa Sr. (April 8, 1951 – July 13, 2015), known professionally as Joan Sebastian (), was a Mexican singer and songwriter. Born in Juliantla, Guerrero, he composed more than 1,000 songs, including compositions for artists such as Bronco, Vicente Fernández, Lucero, Pepe Aguilar, and Rocío Dúrcal. The first several years of his career were primarily focused on Soft rock and Latin pop songs, but later focused primarily on regional Mexican music, specifically banda, mariachi, and norteño. Throughout his career, he also recorded various country songs in Spanish. Sebastian was awarded seven Latin Grammy Awards and five Grammy Awards, making him the most awarded Mexican performer in Grammy history.

Known for composing &quot;Así es la Vida&quot;, Sebastian also worked sporadically as an actor. In 1996, he made his acting debut in the Mexican soap opera &quot;Tú y Yo&quot; (&quot;You and I&quot;), sharing credits with Maribel Guardia, his former wife and mother to his son, Julian. In 2015, Sebastian died at the age of 64 of bone cancer. At the time of his death, Sebastian had two number-one albums on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Latin Albums chart and seven top ten songs on the Hot Latin Songs chart in the United States, including &quot;Eso Y Más&quot;, &quot;Me Gustas&quot;, &quot;Secreto de Amor&quot;, and &quot;Más Allá del Sol&quot;.

==Early life==
Joan Sebastian was born in the rural town of Juliantla in Guerrero. He began composing at the age of seven. His mother enrolled him in a school near Guanajuato when he was eight years old, and returned to his hometown three years later.

At age fourteen, his father sent him away to a monastery in Morelos where he was under the care of Father David Salgado. Due to the clergyman&#x27;s influence on Sebastian, he considered becoming a priest. He enrolled in the Seminario Conciliar de San José in Cuernavaca, Morelos, but realized that he wanted to pursue a music career, and decided to leave the seminary to dedicate himself to music.

==Career==
Before embarking on a singing career, Sebastian was an administrative assistant at a vacation resort in Oaxtepec, Morelos, where he would sing through the intercom. In 1968, Sebastian met Mexican actress Angelica Maria. They stayed together and she asked him to sing some songs for her. She suggested to Sebastian that he record the songs and give them to music producer Eduardo Magallanes, though Sebastian never managed to contact him. He later moved to Mexico City and began asking Discos Capitals Records to listen to his music and produce it. In 1974, he recorded his first album, &quot;Pedro Parrandas&quot;, and received positive feedback from the public.

In 1977, Sebastian decided to stop using his legal name, Jose Manuel Figueroa and took on his artistic name, Joan Sebastian, partly in tribute to San Sebastian, where he previously worked. That same year, he signed a record deal with the label Musart. Later on he would make his known hit &quot;Juliantla&quot; and the famous duet &quot;Maracas&quot; with Alberto Vazquéz.
In 2000, he released &quot;Secreto de Amor&quot; which was certified 4× platinum in the Latin field in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album and title track won the Lo Nuestro Awards for Regional Mexican Album of the Year and Regional Mexican Song of the Year; he also received the Excellence Award for his musical contributions.
In 2006, Sebastian was inducted into the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Music Hall of Fame for his prolific songwriting and musical arrangements. Sebastian was awarded Songwriter of the Year three times by ASCAP and received the Golden Note Award in 2007 in recognition of his songwriting career.

In 2012, Joan Sebastian teamed up with American songwriter and producer Will.i.am for the song and video &quot;Hey You.&quot;

==Personal life==
Sebastian had eight children from five different women. Their names are José Manuel Figueroa González (who is also a singer and songwriter), Juan Sebastián Figueroa González, Trigo de Jesús Figueroa González (first three children with Teresa González, his first wife), Zarelea Figueroa Ocampo (who is also a singer and songwriter), Julián Figueroa Fernández (son of Maribel Guardia, also a singer), Joana Marcelia Figueroa Espín, Juliana Joeri Figueroa Alonso and D&#x27;Yavé Figueroa Espín. His third oldest son, Trigo, was shot in the back of the head after one of his father&#x27;s concerts in Mission, Texas, on August 27, 2006. Trigo had been trying to control the crowd after the show. He was transported to McAllen Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.

On June 12, 2010, his second oldest son, Juan Sebastián was shot dead in Cuernavaca, Morelos, after arriving at a night club with some friends and being refused entrance. Joan Sebastian said his son&#x27;s death had nothing to do with the Mexican drug cartels.

A few months after his death, Televisa announced that a series about his life would begin filming. His youngest son, Julian Figueroa, portrayed his father in his younger days, while his older son, José Manuel Figueroa, portrayed his father in his later days. Livia Brito was also confirmed to portray Maribel Guardia. The series &quot;Por Siempre Joan Sebastian&quot; premiered on June 27, 2016 on Univision and concluded on July 25, 2016.

==Illness and death==
Sebastian was first diagnosed with bone cancer in 1999. He underwent cancer treatment and survived; however, he announced that the cancer had returned in 2007. Undergoing cancer treatment once again, he later announced he was in remission. On July 26, 2012, during one of his concerts, he announced that the cancer had returned for the third time. In 2014, he revealed that he was battling cancer for the fourth time during his performances in Zacatecas.

Weeks prior to his death, he confirmed to the media that he had been hospitalized and undergoing cancer treatment under medical supervision. On July 13, 2015, Joan Sebastian died at 7:15pm (UTC-06:00) at his ranch Cruz de la Sierra, Teacalco Guerrero, Mexico, due to bone cancer. He was 64 years old. His body was buried in a cemetery in Juliantla near his son Trigo.

Relatives of the late singer complained in July 2020 that Sebastian&#x27;s mausoleum had been broken into and the family feared that his remains might be stolen. Security measures were increased.

<doc id="357724" wikidata="Q1277399" url="?curid=357724" title="Metrophanes of Byzantium">
<text>Metrophanes of Byzantium (Greek: Μητροφάνης; died 314) was the 26th bishop of Byzantium according to tradition, holding the office from 306 to 314. He is the first bishop supported by historical sources. In fact, there is no mention of any organized Christian community in Byzantium before him.

There is a tradition that the Roman emperor Constantine the Great bestowed upon him the honorary title of Patriarch; however, Byzantium did not become the capital of the Empire until 330 (when it was renamed Constantinople), and the see was not elevated to a patriarchate until 451. According to Gelasius of Cyzicus, Metrophanes was alive during the First Council of Nicaea (325), but could not partake due to his age and ill health, so he sent instead Alexander of Constantinople, whom he destined as his successor. Metrophanes was most likely already dead by then. Socrates of Constantinople writes that Alexander of Constantinople succeeded Metrophanes sometime before 319.

Metrophanes has been canonised saint and is revered in both the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church. His feast day is 4 June.

His father was Dometius of Byzantium, his uncle was Roman emperor Probus, and his brother Probus of Byzantium. Both were also appointed Bishops of Byzantium before him.

<text>Sak Kʼukʼ also known as Muwaan Mat, Lady Sak Kʼukʼ and Lady Beastie (died 640), was queen of the Maya city-state of Palenque. She acceded to the throne in October, 612 and ruled until 615.

== Biography ==
Her father was Janahb Pakal and her mother was Yohl Ikʼnal or unknown. As Janaab Pakal seems to have had no male heirs, she ascended to the throne on 19 October 612, a few months after her father&#x27;s death. After his maturity, her son Kʼinich Janaab Pakal I succeeded her as ruler on 9.9.2.4.8 5 Lamat 1 Mol. She seems to have continued to wield considerable influence over Palenque in the early decades of her son&#x27;s reign. For example, Sak Kʼukʼ is recorded on Pakal&#x27;s sarcophagus lid as the ruler who celebrated the sealing of the Kʼatun on 9.10.0.0.0 (25 January 633 AD). She was probably mother of Ajen Yohl Mat.

<doc id="357736" wikidata="Q1057199" url="?curid=357736" title="Hokkaido University">
<text>, or , is a public research university in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. Founded in 1918, it is the fifth-oldest government-authorised university in Japan and one of the former Imperial Universities. 

The university finds its roots in Sapporo Agricultural College, which was a pioneer in the country&#x27;s modern agricultural education and research, founded in 1876. The university&#x27;s motto is &#x27;Boys, Be Ambitious&#x27;, which is said to be the parting words of the American dean of the Agricultural College, William S. Clark. 

The university has 12 undergraduate faculties and 21 postgraduate schools. The university mainly operates on two campuses: the main campus is located in downtown Sapporo, just north of Sapporo Station, and the other campus is located in Hakodate, primarily used by the Faculty of Fishery Sciences.

==History==
The history of the university dates to the formal incorporation of Yezo as Hokkaido into the Japanese realm. Director of the Hokkaidō Development Commission Kuroda Kiyotaka, having traveled to America in 1870, looked to the American model of settling the new lands. Upon return he brought General Horace Capron, a commissioner of agriculture who pushed for the adoption of new agricultural practices and crops in Hokkaido&#x27;s colder clime. To achieve this an agriculture college was proposed, leading to the founding of in 1876 by William S. Clark with the help of five faculty members and a first class size of 24 students. In September 1907, set up the faculty of Agriculture in Sapporo. Tohoku Imperial University ceded the Faculty of Agriculture to on April 1, 1918. It was one of nine Imperial Universities. The School of Medicine was established in 1919, at which time the Agricultural College became the Faculty of Agriculture. This was followed by the Faculty of Engineering, the Faculty of Science, and finally in 1947, the Faculty of Law and Literature. The current name of Hokkaido University also came into use in 1947. In 1953, the Graduate School was established.

Since 2004 the university has been incorporated as a National University Corporation under a new law which applies to all national universities. Although the incorporation has led to increased financial independence and autonomy, Hokkaido University is still partially controlled by the Japanese Ministry of Education.

In 2014 the university was selected under the Super Global Universities program that began as an initiative of Prime Minister Shinzō Abe who stated its aim was to help more of Japan&#x27;s universities rank in the top 100 worldwide. Under the program, it is listed in the top university category or Type A—(Top Type) The Top Type is for world-class universities that have the potential to be ranked in the top 100 in world university rankings. Each Type A university will receive ¥420 million ($US 4.2 million) annually until 2023.

In June 2020, Hokkaido University president Toyoharu Nawa was dismissed by Japanese education minister Koichi Hagiuda for abuse of power at the workplace, becoming the first national university president to be dismissed since national universities became independent in 2004. He was succeeded by former neurosurgeon and director of Hokkaido University Hospital Kiyohiro Houkin.

==Faculties and graduate schools==

===Faculties===
===Graduate schools===
===Postgraduate degree programs in English===
The following departments offer postgraduate degrees taught entirely in English

* Agriculture 
* Chemical Sciences and Engineering
* Engineering 
* Environmental Science 
* Life Sciences 
* Science 
* Veterinary Medicine

Both international and domestic students may apply for graduate programs taught in English. Competitive scholarships are available for all graduate and undergraduate students enrolled in English degree programs, which range in amount from tuition discounts to full funding.

=== Special degree programs for international students ===
The university offers two programs aimed exclusively at international students: One, four-year undergraduate degree program, the Modern Japanese Studies Program (MJSP), and one, five-year degree program comprising both undergraduate- and graduate-level study, the Integrated Science Program (ISP). As with other English-based degree programs at the university, competitive scholarships are available for all graduate and undergraduate students, which range in amount from tuition discounts to full funding.

==== Modern Japanese Studies Program (MJSP) ====
The Modern Japanese Studies Program is a bilingual, bachelor&#x27;s degree program that aims to educate students about the history, culture, society, and political economy of modern Japan while raising them to fluency in the Japanese language. The program offers two majors, one in History and Culture and one in Society and Political Economy. The majors share coursework, so whichever of the previous specializations a student does not choose as their major becomes their minor.

==== Integrated Science Program (ISP) ====
The Integrated Science Program is a multifaceted degree program that aims to provide students with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in either physics, chemistry, or biology. Upon enrolling, students will spend the first semester attaining an all-round education in the three sciences along with mathematics and Japanese language. After this intensive first semester, students will join the department of Physics, chemistry or biology within the school of science. The final allocation is decided by a combination of student preference, availability and GPA. Japanese language education continues until the first semester of the second year. After graduation, students have the choice of enrolling in one of Hokkaido University&#x27;s graduate schools. Through the unique, accelerated methodology of the program, students are able to graduate with a master&#x27;s degree in five years (made up of three-and-a-half years of undergraduate study and one-and-a-half years of graduate study and research). All classes, besides Japanese language, are carried out in English by professors with native or fully professional proficiency.

===Institutes===
The university&#x27;s Institute of Seismology and Volcanology was founded in 1998 in collaboration with several seismological observatories around Hokkaido. The institute is represented on the national Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction.

In 2016, the university launched the Hokkaido Summer Institute, a three-month-long program from June to August which offers a variety of classes for both undergraduate and graduate students. Guest lecturers are invited from all over the world to share their expertise for the courses, which usually run for 1–2 weeks and grant students a small amount of academic credit. Both Japanese and foreign students participate in this unique program, which is conducted entirely in English.

==Campus==

===Sapporo campus===

The main Sapporo campus is located just north of Sapporo Station, in the heart of Sapporo City. The entirety of the campus measures approximately 180 hectares and houses academic and administrative buildings, research laboratories, student dormitories, and farmland. The main academic buildings are found along a 1.5 kilometer stretch of road that runs from the Main Gate to the Kita 18 Gate, roughly encompassing the distance between Kita-Juni-Jo and Kita 18-jo subway stations on the Namboku Subway Line. A campus-wide bus service runs regular routes between the southern and northern end of the university, although access is restricted to university staff only.

The abundance of accessible green space has continued to be popular not only among students, but also the general public, who can often be seen using the campus area in a similar way to a public park. Walking tours of the campus for interested foreign and domestic tourists are provided by several businesses in Sapporo, although no tour is needed to visit the campus. Fall is an especially popular time for campus visits, with tourists and Sapporo residents flocking to get a view of the golden ginkgo trees that line Ginkgo Avenue.

===Hakodate campus===
The campus is located in Hakodate, a city located in the southern part of Hokkaidō. The Faculty and Graduate School of Fisheries Science are located there. However, students of Fisheries Science start their education at the Sapporo campus in order to complete three semesters of compulsory liberal arts education courses and move to the Hakodate campus from the second semester of their sophomore year. As the minimum requirement to study at the Hakodate campus is only one year of a four-year bachelor&#x27;s program, the turn-over rate of students entering and leaving the Hakodate campus is fairly high. To provide students in the Faculty and Graduate School of Fisheries Science with practical hands-on experience, the university has two fully operational research vessels, the &quot;Oshoru Maru&quot; and the &quot;Ushio Maru&quot;, based in nearby Hakodate harbor. Graduate students and professors also use these vessels to carry out their research.
===Overseas satellite offices===
In order to raise awareness of the university internationally, as of June 2018 Hokkaido University was operating eight satellite offices worldwide. After opening its first overseas satellite office in Seoul, South Korea, Hokkaido University has also established satellite offices in Helsinki (Finland), Beijing (China), Lusaka (Zambia), Bandung (Indonesia), Quezon City (Philippines), Kamphaeng Saen (Thailand), and a special China Office in Beijing. Interested parties can not only obtain information regarding the university at these offices, but prospective students can also take university entrance exams there, a procedure which previously was only offered in Japan.

<doc id="357739" wikidata="Q4356655" url="?curid=357739" title="Saint Thomas Church (Manhattan)">
<text>Saint Thomas Church is an Episcopal parish church of the Episcopal Diocese of New York at 53rd Street and Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. Also known as Saint Thomas Church Fifth Avenue or Saint Thomas Church in the City of New York, the parish was incorporated on January 9, 1824. The current structure, the congregation&#x27;s fourth church, was designed by the architects Ralph Adams Cram and Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue in the French High Gothic Revival style and completed in 1914. In 2021, it reported 2,852 members, average in-person attendance of 224 (due to pandemic restrictions) and $1,152,588 in plate and pledge income.

In 2020, following a gift from the family trust of the late John and Mary Alyce Merrow, a camera system with a dozen 360-degree-rotating cameras was installed. Online attendance has remained significant; during Advent and Christmas, 2022, on-line participation was 38,000 with an average attendance of 25 minutes.

The church is home to the Saint Thomas Choir of Men and Boys, a choral ensemble comprising men and boys which performs music of the Anglican tradition at worship services and offers a full concert series during the course of the year. The men of the Saint Thomas Choir are professional singers and the boys are students enrolled at the Saint Thomas Choir School, the only church-affiliated residential choir school in the United States, where the choristers make up the whole student body. Only three such schools remain in the world currently; the two Anglican Choir Schools are Saint Thomas Choir School and Westminster Abbey Choir School in the United Kingdom.

== History ==
=== Broadway and Houston Street ===
On October 12, 1823, members of three Episcopal parishes in Lower Manhattan collaborated to organize a new episcopal church in New York. These included William Backhouse Astor, a wealthy Manhattan landowner; Charles King, later president of Columbia University; and jurist William Beach Lawrence. The congregation came from Grace Church, Trinity Church, and St. George&#x27;s Church.

Saint Thomas Church was incorporated on January 9, 1824, and the cornerstone of the new church building laid in July 1824 at the northwest corner of Broadway and Houston Street. The first church edifice opened in 1826 and was described as &quot;the best specimen of Gothic in the city.&quot; The location was the northern extent of developed settlement in Manhattan during the early 19th century. It was designed in a Gothic Revival style by architect Joseph R. Brady and John McVickar, professor of moral philosophy at Columbia College (now Columbia University). The church was enlarged and remodeled in 1844 to accommodate a growing congregation.

The first Saint Thomas&#x27;s Church was destroyed by fire on March 2, 1851. The congregation built a new church at the same location, completed in 1852. The character of the neighborhood at the corner of Broadway and Houston, the southeastern corner of Greenwich Village, broadly speaking, had &quot;degenerated into anchorage for cheap dance halls and &#x27;concert salloons&#x27;&quot; by the 1860s. This led to the congregation seeking to relocate.

=== Move to midtown ===
A third church was built from 1865 to 1870 at the corner of 53rd Street and Fifth Avenue based upon a design by Richard Upjohn and his son Richard Michell Upjohn. The cornerstone for the new church was laid on October 14, 1868. Two years later, on October 6, 1870, the congregation moved into its new home. This structure, in a neighborhood at the time dominated by the mansions of Manhattan&#x27;s upper class, featured a prominent high tower and a bas-relief reredos by Augustus Saint-Gaudens and murals by John LaFarge. Though the new Saint Thomas&#x27;s was a parish church, its location and design evoked that of a cathedral.

The third building was also the site of many high society weddings and funerals, including that of Consuelo Vanderbilt to Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough, the first cousin of Winston Churchill. This structure was destroyed by fire on August 8, 1905. Only the tower remained from the third church. The congregation built a 1,200-seat chapel on the rest of the site.

=== Current church ===
The fourth and current church, designed in 1906, was built from 1911 to 1913 to a design by Ralph Adams Cram and Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue of the architectural firm of Cram, Goodhue and Ferguson. The cornerstone was laid on November 21, 1911, and the new building opened to congregants on October 4, 1913. It was consecrated on April 25, 1916. The design by Cram and Goodhue won an architectural competition to build the new Saint Thomas Church, winning over entries by George Browne Post and Robert W. Gibson.

The 1906 San Francisco earthquake had so shocked the church&#x27;s rector, Rev. Ernest M. Stires, that he rushed the accumulated balance in his parish&#x27;s building fund to aid the stricken city. The public responded in kind to his generosity with unsolicited gifts that more than replenished the fund.

Cram and Goodhue are also noted for having designed Saint Bartholomew&#x27;s Church on Park Avenue and East 50th Street, the Cathedral of St. John the Divine on Amsterdam Avenue and West 110th Street, the chapel and a large portion of the campus at the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, the Princeton University Chapel at Princeton University and the Rockefeller Chapel at the University of Chicago.

=== 21st century ===

==== September 11 ministry ====
In the wake of the September 11 attacks in 2001, Saint Thomas Church reached out to the British expatriate community in recognition of its Anglican heritage. This culminated in an interfaith service held at the church on September 20, 2001. The service was addressed by Prime Minister Tony Blair and broadcast live in its entirety throughout the United Kingdom. On October 28, 2002, the rector of Saint Thomas Church, Andrew C. Mead, was made an honorary Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) by Queen Elizabeth II. The honor was conferred at a ceremony at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C.

==== Bicentennial and twinning anniversaries ====
In October 2023 Saint Thomas Church commemorated the bicentennial of its founding in 1823, with an exhibition, lectures and special services. The Assistant Bishop of New York, the Rt. Rev. Mary Glasspool, and the Sub-Dean of the Chapel Royal, Paul Wright, preached in celebration of the anniversary.

The following year, in May 2024, the 100th anniversary of the twinning of the cities of New York City and York in England was marked with special services attended by the Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, the Most Rev. Michael Curry, the Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, the Mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, the Lord Mayor of York, Chris Cullwick, the Dean of York, the Very Rev. Dominic Barrington, and the British Consul General in New York, Hannah Young.

== Rectors ==
== Architecture ==
The present church, a New York City designated landmark, was designed by a partnership of Ralph Adams Cram and Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue. Lee Lawrie designed the sculptures and decorations. It measures long and wide. The church building rises .

=== Facade ===
Saint Thomas Church has plain ashlar limestone exterior surfaces in the French High Gothic style. The church&#x27;s asymmetrical main elevation on Fifth Avenue is divided into three sections, reflecting the interior divisions. The nave is slightly off-center, with a wide chantry to the south and a narrow aisle to the north.

==== Main entrance ====
The main entrance, which leads to the nave, is flanked by large buttresses. The entrance portal contains niches with sculptures. The center of the portal is divided vertically by a trumeau with a sculpture depicting Thomas the Apostle. There are three sculptures on each side, depicting six of the apostles. These sculptures, part of the original plan, were not installed until 1963. There are gilded low relief panels above the main doors, which depict the congregation&#x27;s four buildings.

Above the portal are more sculptures, interspersed with small windows. These depict the six remaining apostles as well as Mary Magdalene and Martha. Decorative archivolts above these niches and windows contain depictions of Thomas the Apostle&#x27;s life, the sacraments, and the gifts of the holy spirit. These in turn are topped by more figures of saints. The entrance is topped by a large rose window with a tetramorph in low relief.

==== Other sections ====
To the left (south) of the main entrance, there is a square tower at the southeast corner of the church, facing Fifth Avenue and 53rd Street. The tower has a simpler design than the main entrance, with band courses and other horizontal design features that relate to the main entrance&#x27;s design. At the top is a bell tower, which was cited in 1940 as having 25 chimes.

To the right (north) of the main entrance is a narrow section of wall, leading to the north aisle. The northern entrance contains a depiction of Ernest M. Stires holding a model of the current church. Stires was the rector when the church was completed.

The southern elevation contains five bays, which are separated by buttresses. Next to the square tower, in the easternmost bay, is an entrance to the chantry. Above the entrance there are motifs relating to the sanctity of marriage. The other bays contain stained glass windows in the chantry. To the west is the gallery, which contains five bays of tripartite windows made of stained glass. The three center bays of the gallery contain an arcade of three arched doorways. The buttresses contain sculptures of ancient leaders and philosophers. Above the four windows in the chantry and the five windows in the south gallery are nine recessed clerestory windows, illuminating the top of the nave.

To the west of the main church is the parish house, which is a separate structure. The parish house is five stories tall and contains an oriel window in its eastern bay, separating it from the rest of the church. The entrance to the parish house is on 53rd Street; it was originally at the rear of the gallery arcade. The roof of the parish house is covered in lead.

==== Stained glass ====
The first stained glass window placed in the fourth Saint Thomas Church structure was designed by Nicola D&#x27;Ascenzo, an Italian-born American stained glass artist. The window was designed in 1926 and completed and installed in 1927. The last window, designed and installed in 1974, came from the Willet Stained Glass Studios, headed by E. Crosby Willet and founded by William Willet. Both those studios were located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the time of the fabrication of their windows for Saint Thomas Church.

James Powell &amp; Sons (Whitefriars), Ltd, of London, secured a contract for the remaining windows in the present church structure, including all except one of the clerestory windows. Each window measures tall and wide and depict biblical figures interacting with notable American bishops. The windows for the present structure were designed beginning in 1929 by English stained glass artist James Humphries Hogan, who also the main American sales agent for the firm. He labored from 1926 to 1928 to acquire the commission for the Saint Thomas Church windows. Hogan&#x27;s son, Edmond Humphries Hogan, designed some of the windows, including those in the Rector&#x27;s office. The actual fabrication and installation of the Powell &amp; Sons windows was not completed until 1970, but most of the windows were designed by Hogan before his death in 1948. Five windows were designed and completed after his death: one in 1950, one in 1954, two in 1959, and one in 1970. Those windows were the work of another Powell &amp; Sons artist, Edward Liddall Armitage.

In 2007, conservation began in earnest on all the stained glass windows in the present structure. It took ten years and $20 million to renew the splendor of 33 windows, with their 9 million pieces of glass. The restoration was completed in February 2017.

=== Interior ===
The interior surfaces are made of sandstone. Saint Thomas Church is characterized by a high main arcade, an open triforium, and a clerestory. The narthex, just inside the main portal, was originally decorated with symbols of four classical elements, four seasons of the year, and four angels. After World War II, these were replaced with motifs that represented peace and honored those who were killed in the war. These motifs include mosaics on the floors as well as an altar at the north end. The narthex and nave were initially separated by an oak screen, which was replaced in 1961 by glass.

At the front of the nave is a parapet with eight mosaics. The four mosaics on the left depict symbols of the church, while those on the right depict major events in the history of the United States. There is also an octagonal pulpit made of oak. The pulpit is surrounded by statues of preachers. Above it is a sounding board depicting prophecies of the Old Testament. The lectern of the pulpit is also inlaid in wood. Ornate wooden carving is placed around the rest of the chancel, including on the choir stalls, altar rail, and kneeling rail. The altar rail also has a bronze grill flanked by oak carvings of angels. There is an organ screen that depicts notable organists.

The elaborate reredos, gifted by the family of Harris C. Fahnestock, was designed by Goodhue and Lawrie and executed by the Ardolino Brothers. The reredos contains niches with depictions of saints, prophets, reformers, and Christian dignitaries. It is high, covering the west wall of the chancel, and consists of more than 60 stone figures relating to the discovery of Thomas the Apostle.

The church&#x27;s superstructure is built of stone and originally did not contain any steel reinforcement. This contrasted with many other buildings from the early 20th century, which tended to be steel-framed. The architects believed that, if the church was designed in the Gothic style, then its superstructure had to be built the same way. In 1925, eleven years after completion, the north wall of the church was found to be bulging dangerously and hidden steelwork added. The construction of the New York City Subway&#x27;s 53rd Street Line in the 1930s prompted additional steel under the altar and massive reredos as a precaution.

==== Acoustics ====
The architects realized that the sound associated with a Gothic look would not work for a more sermon-focused Protestant service. Wallace Sabine, founder of the field of architectural acoustics, was hired to reduce reverberation in order to make the sermon more intelligible. Sabine avoided changing the church&#x27;s aesthetic by hanging panels and drapes to absorb sound. Instead he worked with Rafael Guastavino Jr. to create Rumford tile, a ceramic tile with porous surfaces that absorb sound. The church was among the first to be acoustically engineered for environmental control.

== Worship ==
The style of worship at Saint Thomas Church has varied greatly over the history of the parish. Beginning with the rectorship of John Andrew in 1972, however, it has informally followed the Anglo-Catholic or high-church tradition within the Episcopal Church that developed out of the Oxford Movement. This was further developed under the rectorship of Andrew Mead. Sunday services include Low Mass, High Mass, and Evensong, and Solemn Mass on Christmas, Easter and major feast days. Special liturgies and processions are held for Advent, Epiphany, Candlemas and Holy Week. The Litany is sung in procession in Advent and Lent. For masses at the High Altar, the Church uses a variation on the three traditional sacred ministers &quot;ad orientem&quot;, however as with many other Anglo-Catholic parishes that do not look to Tridentine Rome for liturgical cues, many of the unique traditional roles of sacred ministers are currently in use—the Deacon reads the Gospel and the Subdeacon reads the Epistle. The two sacred ministers who are not celebrating the Mass essentially vest and act as priests in tunicles. The readings are not chanted. The choir of men and boys sing most Sundays in term time and, if there are no visiting choirs during the school vacation, the gentlemen of the choir sing the services. The church uses traditional language for many of its services on Sundays and weekdays and the King James Version of the Bible is used at Sunday choral services and at Choral Evensong and Solemn Mass on feast days during the week. Rite II of the BCP 1979 is used for the 12:10 pm Mass Mondays to Fridays. In Lent 2015 Shrine Prayers were started at the image of &quot;Our Lady of Fifth Avenue&quot; and intercessions are offered at noon after the Angelus Mondays to Saturdays; these intercessions may be left in the church or submitted online via the church website, and many prayer requests come from around the world every week. Confessions are heard each Saturday from 11:00–11:45 am. Since 2021, the 9 am Sunday Mass has become a Low-Church type children and family focused service, using Rite II and &quot;ad populum&quot; altar placed in the Chancel. A robed children&#x27;s outreach choir called the Noble Singers and composed of local girls and boys sings at the 9 am service. On the second Sunday of each month, a Sunday Mass is offered in Korean Language. The church is open every day of the year.

== Music ==

=== Choir of Men and Boys ===
Music is an important component of worship and liturgy at Saint Thomas Church. It follows in the Anglican tradition of the all-male choral ensemble. The boy choristers reside at Saint Thomas Choir School.

The choir&#x27;s primary function is to provide music for five services each week, as well as an annual concert series sponsored by the church. In addition, the choir has toured throughout North America and Europe, performing at venues such as the Lincoln Center, Westminster Abbey, and the Vatican. They have sung alongside artists such as Jessye Norman and Plácido Domingo, and gave the world-premiere performance of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;, which was televised internationally by the BBC. The choir was featured in a recording of Carly Simon&#x27;s &quot;Let the River Run&quot;, and has released a number of its own CDs.

Choral services are occasionally recorded for broadcast on the radio, most recently in November 2024 when Evensong and Matins were recorded for BBC Radio 3 and BBC Radio 4, respectively.

In January 2025 plans were announced to expand the church&#x27;s musical program with the formation of a girls&#x27; choir and a choir of men and women.

=== Organs ===

Musical offerings at Saint Thomas Church are enhanced through three organs. The Arents Memorial Chancel Organ, which has been replaced with the Irene D. and William R. Miller Chancel Organ in Memory of John Scott, was initially built as the &quot;Opus 205&quot; of the Ernest M. Skinner Company of Boston, Massachusetts, in 1913. This organ, which was revised in 1945, boasted 4 manuals and 77 ranks. In 1956, the organ was rebuilt, as &quot;Opus 205-A&quot;, by the Aeolian-Skinner Company by G. Donald Harrison (died 1956), who died before the work was completed. This rebuilding expanded the organ to comprise 172 ranks. With damage to the reredos and the organ due to construction of the Museum of Modern Art, the church&#x27;s immediate neighbor on West 53rd Street, Gilbert F. Adams of Brooklyn was contracted in 1969 to repair and rebuilt the organ. This revision decreased the number of ranks to 156. Further revisions were completed in the early 1980s by Mann &amp; Trupiano. With the exception of the Trompette-en-Chamade, located under the Rose Window above the narthex, the entire instrument of the Great Organ was located in the church&#x27;s chancel. The now-dismantled Great Organ featured an Electro-pneumatic and electric-slider stop and chest action, a Solid-State combination action, 4 manuals, 158 ranks and 9,050 pipes.

The Loening-Hancock Gallery Organ was built as &quot;Opus 27&quot; of Taylor &amp; Boody Organbuilders of Staunton, Virginia, in 1996 to honor Gerre Hancock for 25 years of service to Saint Thomas Church. Located in the gallery beneath the church&#x27;s Rose Window, this organ features a mechanical key and stop action, originally possessing 2 manuals, 25 stops, and 32 ranks. In 2015 it was slightly enlarged, according to original preparations, to its current 3 manuals, 31 stops and 44 ranks. Its case sports
fumed white oak with pipe shades gilded in 23 carat gold. Its predecessor, the Loening Memorial Organ, dedicated in memory of Hermine Rubino Leoning, was built by Gilbert F. Adams in 1969 and featured 4 manuals, 59 stops, and 90 ranks.

The Martha J. Dodge Positiv Organ was built and installed in December 2001 by Taylor &amp; Boody Organbuilders. This organ consists of 5 ranks, and is used as a continuo organ.

==== Miller-Scott Organ ====

On October 3, 2008, Saint Thomas Church announced its Vestry&#x27;s decision to replace the aging Arents Memorial Chancel Organ with a new instrument. The announcement noted that as part of a substantial renovation effort to the church, a new instrument from Dobson Pipe Organ Builders of Lake City, Iowa, would be installed to replace the current instrument. Plans called for the retention of the especially ornate 1913 organ case-front and console cabinetry and, to better respect the church&#x27;s well-developed neo-Gothic design aesthetic, the elimination of visible organ pipes added above the choir stall canopies in the 1956 rebuild.

The Irene D. and William R. Miller Chancel Organ in Memory of John Scott, dedicated on October 5 and 7, 2018, is one of North America&#x27;s most significant new pipe organs. In addition to supporting the parish&#x27;s internationally renowned liturgical and musical life, the Miller-Scott Organ serves as a showcase for recitalists from all over the world and helps Saint Thomas train the next generation of organists.

The new organ contains 7,069 pipes, a number of which are from the former instrument. Fifteen sets of pipes, including some of the largest existing wooden ones, have been rebuilt and reinstated; these include the very softest sounds, several flutes and strings, and some specialty trumpet stops. Much of the design and decoration form for the new organ case are derived from precedents throughout the rest of the building, and Gothic revival style in general. In the 1913 north organ case, imagery is taken from Psalm 150: trumpet and lyre, string and cymbal. The new organ case takes as its decorative program the themes of music, ministry and praise. Carved texts include &quot;Soli Deo Gloria&quot; and quotations from the Psalms. Major carvings depict symbols of the Four Evangelists, and there are portraits of persons important in the recent life of Saint Thomas Church, including former directors of music Gerre Hancock and John Scott, Rector Emeritus Fr. Andrew Mead, and Irene and William Miller, whose benefaction was central to the creation of the Miller-Scott Organ.

<text>Aloha Stadium is a closed multi-purpose stadium in Halawa, Hawaii, a census-designated place that is a western suburb of Honolulu. It is the largest stadium in the state of Hawaii. , the stadium ceased fan-attended operations indefinitely, and placed a moratorium on the scheduling of new events. It is located next to the Hālawa station of the Skyline rail system.

Aloha Stadium served as home to the University of Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football team (Mountain West Conference, NCAA Division I FBS) for the 1975 through 2020 seasons. It also hosted college football&#x27;s Hawaii Bowl (2002–2019) and Hula Bowl (1976–1997, 2006–2008, 2020–2021), and formerly was home to the National Football League&#x27;s Pro Bowl from 1980 through 2016 (except in 2010 and 2015). It also hosted numerous high school football games, and served as a venue for large concerts and events, including high school graduation ceremonies. The stadium was home field for the AAA Hawaii Islanders of the Pacific Coast League (PCL) from 1975 to 1987, before the team moved to Colorado Springs. Frequent swap meets in the stadium&#x27;s parking lot often draw large crowds.

==History==

Before 1975, Honolulu&#x27;s main outdoor stadium had been Honolulu Stadium, a wooden stadium on King Street. However, it had reached the end of its useful life by the 1960s, and was well below the standards for Triple-A baseball. The need for a new stadium was hastened by the move of the Hawaii Rainbows football program to NCAA Division I. Located west of downtown Honolulu and north of Honolulu International Airport, Aloha Stadium was constructed in 1975 at a cost of $37 million. Constructed of steel, the stadium was nicknamed the &quot;Metal Mecca&quot;. The baseball field was aligned north-northwest (home plate to centerfield), as was the football field.

The first sporting event at Aloha Stadium was a college football game between Hawaii and Texas A&amp;I (now Texas A&amp;M-Kingsville) on September 13, 1975. Played on Saturday night, the crowd was 32,247, and the visitors prevailed, 

The final sporting event held in Aloha Stadium was the 2021 Hula Bowl. The last points scored at Aloha Stadium were a “pick 6” touchdown scored by Carlo Kemp of the University of Michigan.

The stadium was somewhat problematic for its initial primary tenant, the minor league baseball Hawaii Islanders. Located in south-central Oahu, it was far from the team&#x27;s fan base in Mōʻiliʻili, and many were unwilling to make the drive. Additionally, while local public transportation (TheBus) stopped at the main gate of Honolulu Stadium, the stop for Aloha Stadium was located some distance from the gate. As a result, attendance plummeted and never really recovered—a major factor in the franchise&#x27;s ultimate move to the mainland.

Additionally, stadium management initially refused to allow the use of metal spikes on the AstroTurf. During a game in early May 1976, the starting pitcher for the Tacoma Twins, Bill Butler, wore metal spikes to comply with a directive from Tacoma&#x27;s parent club. In response, stadium management turned off the center field lights, and after 35 minutes, umpires forfeited the game to the Twins. The Islanders protested, claiming they had no control over the lights. However, the Pacific Coast League (PCL) sided with the Twins, citing a league rule that the home team is responsible for providing acceptable playing facilities. After the teams ended the season in a tie for first in the PCL&#x27;s Western Division, Hawaii won a one-game playoff in Tacoma.
As originally built, Aloha Stadium had various configurations for different sport venues and other purposes. Four movable 7,000-seat sections, each could move using air casters into a diamond configuration for baseball (also used for soccer), an oval for football, or a triangle for concerts. In January 2007, the stadium was permanently locked into its football configuration due to cost and maintenance issues. An engineer from Rolair Systems, the NASA spin-off company that engineered the system, claims that the problem was caused by a concrete contractor that ignored specifications for the concrete pads under the stadium.

===Concerns===
There were numerous discussions with Hawaii lawmakers who were concerned with the physical condition of the stadium. There were also several issues regarding rusting of the facility, several hundred seats that need to be replaced, and restroom facilities that need to be expanded to accommodate more patrons. Much of the rust was due to building the stadium with weathering steel. U.S. Steel Corporation suggested the steel would develop a protective patina that would eliminate the need for painting. However, given Honolulu&#x27;s ocean-salt laden climate, the steel never stopped rusting.

A 2005 study by Honolulu engineering firm Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc. determined that the stadium required $99 million to be completely restored and an additional $115 million for ongoing maintenance and refurbishment over the next 20 years to extend its useful life. In early 2007, the state legislature proposed to spend $300 million to build a new facility as opposed to spending approximately $216 million to extend the life of Aloha Stadium for another years.

One council member said that if immediate repairs were not made within the next seven years, then the stadium would probably have to be demolished due to safety concerns. In May 2007, the state allotted $12.4 million to be used towards removing corrosion and rust from the structure.

===Expansion and improvements===
In 2003, the stadium surface was changed from AstroTurf (which had been in place since the stadium opened) to FieldTurf. In July 2011, the field was replaced with an Act Global UBU Sports Speed S5-M synthetic turf system.

In 2008, the state of Hawaii approved the bill of $185 million to refurbish the aging Aloha Stadium. In 2010, Aloha Stadium completely retrofitted its scoreboard and video screen to be more up to date with its high definition capability. The Aloha Stadium Authority planned to add more luxury suites, replacing all seats, rusting treatments, parking lots, more restrooms, pedestrian bridge supports, an enclosed lounge, and more. There was also a proposal that would have enclosed the four openings in the corners of the stadium to add more seats.
In 2011, the playing field was refurbished in part due to a naming rights sponsorship from Hawaiian Airlines. As a result of the sponsorship deal, the field was referred to as Hawaiian Airlines Field at Aloha Stadium. The airline did not renew sponsorship after the deal expired in 2016. As a result, the field went unnamed until late August, when Hawaiian Tel Federal Credit Union signed a three-year $275,000 agreement. As of 2016, the field was known as Hawaiian Tel Federal Credit Union Field at Aloha Stadium.

In early 2017, there was a study in the &quot;Honolulu Star-Advertiser&quot; about replacing Aloha Stadium due to safety concerns and a liability risk. The plan was then to build a smaller 30,000 seat stadium on the existing property and also build commercial development around the stadium. In theory, this would save the state millions of dollars instead of renovating and keep the existing stadium as it was.

In July 2019, Governor of Hawaii David Ige signed Act 268 into law, appropriating $350 million for an Aloha Stadium redevelopment project. The funds were to go toward the construction of a new stadium and land development, including a mixed-use sports and entertainment complex.

===Closure to new events===
A December 17, 2020, announcement by the Aloha Stadium Authority stated that the stadium would be ceasing fan-attended operations indefinitely. The closure was related to financial issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The stadium, built in 1975, was also plagued by maintenance issues in recent years. A 2019 story from the &quot;Honolulu Star-Advertiser&quot; noted that the stadium needed $30 million in repairs. KHON-TV reported that the stadium would be condemned and was deemed unsafe to hold any crowds at all. The scheduling of new events was also halted. In January 2021, the University of Hawaii announced that the Rainbow Warriors football team would play their home games on campus &quot;for at least the next three years&quot;.

===New stadium===

The New Aloha Stadium is a proposed 25,000–35,000 seat multi-purpose stadium to be built in Halawa, Hawaii, for the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football program, with demolition of the old stadium to begin in 2025. The area around the stadium will also include entertainment venues, retail stores, restaurants, housing, hotels, recreational sites, cultural amenities, and green space. It will replace, and be constructed on the site of, the current Aloha Stadium.

==Events==
===American football===
====College football====
Aloha Stadium served as the home field of the Hawaii Rainbow Warriors college football program, representing the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, from 1975 through 2020.

The Hula Bowl, a college football all-star game, was first played at the stadium in January 1976 and returned to the stadium annually through 1997. It was again held at Aloha Stadium in 2006–2008 and 2020–2021. The 2021 Hula Bowl was the last football game held at the facility before the halting of new events.

Three team-competitive college football bowl games were held annually at the stadium: the Aloha Bowl (1982–2000), Oahu Bowl (1998–2000), and Hawaii Bowl (2002–2019). The Hawaii Rainbow Warriors appeared in the Hawaii Bowl nine times and the other two bowl games once each.

====Professional football====
Starting in September 1975, the stadium was home to the World Football League&#x27;s Hawaiians who played their last four home games there. The San Francisco 49ers and the San Diego Chargers played an NFL preseason game at Aloha Stadium on August 21, 1976. In August 2019, the NFL returned to the stadium with a preseason game between the Los Angeles Rams and Dallas Cowboys.

The National Football League&#x27;s all-star game, the Pro Bowl, was held annually at the stadium from 1980 through 2016, except in 2010 and 2015.

===Baseball===
The stadium served as the home field for the Hawaii Islanders, a Triple-A team competing in the Pacific Coast League, from 1976 to 1987.

In , a three-game regular season series between St. Louis Cardinals and San Diego Padres of Major League Baseball (MLB) was held at the stadium. Called the Padres Paradise Series, the series was played as a doubleheader on April 19 and a nationally broadcast (ESPN) game on April 20. In 1979, the Padres had played a three-game preseason series against the Seibu Lions of Japan&#x27;s Pacific League at the stadium.

===Soccer===
On April 7, 1976, the Aloha Soccer Festival triple-header was held at the stadium. In the feature match, Pelé scored four goals as his New York Cosmos defeated Japan, 5-0, in front of a crowd of 21,705. (In the other matches, the NASL&#x27;s San Diego Jaws routed the Hawaii All-Stars, 6-0, while the Philippines edged Taiwan, 1-0.)

Encouraged by the tournament&#x27;s success, the San Antonio Thunder became Team Hawaii in 1977, bringing the NASL to the Aloha State. Pelé and the Cosmos returned on April 13, 1977, as 12,877 watched New York defeat Hawaii, 2-1. (None of Team Hawaii&#x27;s other twelve home games drew even half of that; they managed only 4,543 per game for the season, and moved to Tulsa in 1978.)

Aloha Stadium hosted the inaugural Pan-Pacific Championship (February 20–23, 2008), a knockout soccer tournament, involving four teams from Japan&#x27;s J-League, North America&#x27;s Major League Soccer (MLS) and Australia/New Zealand&#x27;s A-League. The 2012 Hawaiian Islands Invitational was also held at the venue.

The United States women&#x27;s national soccer team was scheduled to play a game against Trinidad and Tobago as part of their World Cup Winning Victory Tour at the stadium on December 6, 2015; however, the game was canceled the day before gameday due to concerns over the turf being unsafe to play on.

===Rugby===
On June 2, 2013, the stadium played host to a rugby league test match where Samoa defeated the USA 34–10.

In June, the Brisbane Broncos from the Australasian-based National Rugby League (NRL) competition organized for a rugby league match to be played at Aloha Stadium against NRL rivals Penrith Panthers later in 2015. However, in September the NRL blocked the idea and the game didn&#x27;t go ahead.

Aloha Stadium also hosted the Aloha World Sevens.

In 2020 it was proposed that Kanaloa Hawai’i, a proposed Major League Rugby (MLR) team, be based at Aloha Stadium after &quot;a few years&quot; in a smaller venue; however, MLR and Kanaloa Hawai’i did not reach an agreement for the team to join the league.

===Graduation ceremonies===
Aloha Stadium is also the venue for five public high school graduation ceremonies: Radford High School, Mililani High School, Aiea High School, James Campbell High School, and Pearl City High School.

=== Concerts ===

==In popular culture==
Aloha Stadium appeared in the climax of the 2006 animated television film &quot;Leroy &amp; Stitch&quot;, the finale film to &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series&quot; and the main continuity of the &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; franchise. In the film&#x27;s final act, Dr. Hämsterviel and his Leroy army dump Jumba Jookiba&#x27;s first 624 genetic experiments into the stadium to be destroyed, only for Lilo, Stitch, Jumba, Pleakley, Gantu, and Reuben to arrive and stop Hämsterviel. After a fight between the experiments and the Leroys, the main heroes throw an impromptu concert (initially set up for a fictional event called &quot;Alohapalooza&quot;), performing &quot;Aloha ʻOe&quot; to trigger a failsafe to shut down the Leroys. Although the stadium is not identified by name, it is confirmed to be Aloha Stadium through a special thanks credit in the film&#x27;s closing credits.

In , episode three of the CBS television series &quot;&quot; (first aired February 26, 2024), titled &quot;License to Thrill&quot;, Aloha Stadium was the setting for a fictional extreme motorsports exhibition, World of Hyperdrome.

<text>This article chronicles the history of British film certificates.

==Overview==
The UK&#x27;s film ratings are decided by the British Board of Film Classification and have been since 1912. Previously, there were no agreed rating standards, and local councils imposed their ownoften differingconditions or restrictions. For cinema releases, the BBFC has no legal power (technically, films do not even have to be submitted for classification), as it falls to councils to decide who should be admitted to a certain film, but they generally apply the BBFC&#x27;s certificates, effectively making them legally binding. In exceptional cases, councils may impose their own conditions, either raising or lowering the minimum entry age from the certificate, banning a certified film outright, or setting their own minimum entry age for films that have never been submitted for BBFC certification, or which have been refused a certificate by the Board.
Prior to 1985, there were no legally binding ratings on video releases. The Video Recordings Act 1984 introduced new legal powers to certify video releases independently from any existing cinema certificate, with the BBFC being required to rate every new video release (except those exempted from classification) to determine the minimum age of people to whom the recording can be supplied, whether by sale or rental. In August 2009 it was discovered that the Video Recordings Act 1984 never had legal effect, due to a technical error when the terms of the act were not communicated to the European Commission. The relevant provisions were re-enacted by Parliament as the Video Recordings Act 2010.

The following list chronicles the BBFC&#x27;s ratings system from its inception to the present.

In each section, &quot;italics&quot; indicates when a certificate has changed since the previous system.

==History==

===1912–1932===
At first, there were just two advisory certificates.

In Ireland, following the independence of the Irish Free State in 1922 (now the Republic of Ireland), the Irish Film Censor&#x27;s Office was created in 1923 in place of the BBFC. This was renamed the Irish Film Classification Office in 2008.

===1932–1951===
An H (Horrific) certificate was added in 1932 to alert parents to horror-themed material.

===1951–1970===
Following a recommendation by the County Councils Association to replace the BBFC, the government established a committee chaired by Professor Kenneth Wheare to examine film censorship. The committee&#x27;s findings were published in 1950 and proposed creation of four new certificates (X - films aimed at adults only, from which children should be absolutely excluded; C - films aimed specifically at children; Category U - films suitable for all; Category A - films suitable for all, but dealing with mild adult subject matter). Only one of these proposals were adopted and saw for the first time, a compulsory certificate, X, introduced allowing only those aged 16 and older to enter. This replaced the H certificate.
===1970–1982===
On 1 July 1970 the A certificate was split into two: The old &#x27;A&#x27; (advisory) category was split to create a new advisory &#x27;A&#x27; which permitted the admission of children of 5 years or over whether accompanied or not, but which warned parents that a film in this category would contain some material that parents might prefer their children under 14 not to see while the new AA allowed only those aged 14 or over to be admitted. As there was now a mandatory certificate at 14, the X certificate was modified to raise its age from 16 to 18.

===1982–1985===
On 1 November 1982 the ratings system was completely overhauled with only the U certificate remaining unchanged (though its description was slightly modified). The A certificate was replaced by PG, which was now completely advisory. The age of AA was raised a year and the certificate was renamed 15. The X certificate was unchanged but renamed 18 due to the lewd reputation that the letter X had acquired. A new R18 certificate was introduced for sexually explicit films. In order to show R18 films, cinemas must be licensed members-only clubs (previously, a loophole allowed these clubs to show such films unrated). The current and new certificates introduced different shapes for each rating.

===1985–1989===
The Video Recordings Act 1984 gave the BBFC the legal responsibility to rate all videos. The current certificates were all used and were also modified and coloured. A new Uc certificate was introduced for videos only to indicate a recording that is especially suitable for young children to watch on their own. Those under the age of a certificate could not buy or rent a video with that certificate. Shops wishing to sell or rent R18 videos had to apply for a licence. Video releases in this period often featured unofficial logos with a plain background.

===1989–2002===
Due to the large gap between PG and 15 and industry pressure regarding &quot;Batman&quot;, a 12 certificate was introduced on 1 August 1989. However, it was for cinema use only and did not cover videos. From this point on video releases featured the official BBFC logos. The 12 certificate was eventually introduced for videos on 1 July 1994. As the 12 certificate did not apply to video releases before July 1994, several films which had been issued a 12 classification for cinema release had to have a decision made about them regarding which rating was suitable for a video release and if a 15 certificate was deemed too high a rating for a particular film, a PG certificate was given with possible cuts to fit the rating. Films which received the 12 classification for cinema and 15 classification for video include &quot;Uncle Buck&quot;, which later passed with 12 for video on re-submission, and &quot;Nuns on the Run&quot;, which currently remains 15, with re-submission. All of the symbols were also graphically edited with lighter text in 1999 from the bolder text used since 1985 although many home video releases continued to use the previous symbols.

In 2002, the cinema 12 certificate was modified and renamed 12A. Those under 12 could now be admitted to 12A films, provided that they were accompanied by an adult aged at least 18 years old, although the BBFC recommends that 12A films are generally unsuitable for children under 12 years old. Contrary to popular belief, the certificate was not introduced for the film &quot;Spider-Man&quot;; the first film to receive it was actually &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;. However, &quot;Spider-Man&quot; and other films still on general release at the time were reclassified as 12A. Introduction of the 12A followed two years of consultation and a trial period in Norwich, during which time the certificate was known as PG-12 (see below). The video 12 certificate remained unchanged.

===2002–2020===
In September 2002, all of the symbols were graphically modernised but retained all their main features (colour, shape, etc.). The Uc certificate was retired in 2009, and replaced with BBFCInsight which states where works are &#x27;particularly suitable for pre-school children&#x27;; however, older DVDs may still carry the Uc certificate. The consumer advice for the U certificate was updated to advise parents to check the film in case of children under the age of 4 and PG in case of children under 8.

=== 2019–present ===
The 12 symbol was made the same colour as the 12A symbol, whilst the 15 symbol changed from the white background with red writing to the pink background with white writing. In October 2019, for the first time, all of the symbols were redesigned for digital streaming services and theatrical releases. However, the packaged media continued to only use the previous symbols until late April 2020, although a transition period was allowed for video releases to use either the old or new symbols until 5 October 2020, after which all packaged media must by law use the new symbols. The BBFCInsight was replaced with ratings info.

<text>Poliovirus, the causative agent of polio (also known as poliomyelitis), is a serotype of the species &quot;Enterovirus C&quot;, in the family of &quot;Picornaviridae&quot;. There are three poliovirus serotypes, numbered 1, 2, and 3.

Poliovirus is composed of an RNA genome and a protein capsid. The genome is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA (+ssRNA) genome that is about 7500 nucleotides long. The viral particle is about 30 nm in diameter with icosahedral symmetry. Because of its short genome and its simple composition—only a strand of RNA and a nonenveloped icosahedral protein coat encapsulating it—poliovirus is widely regarded as the simplest significant virus.

Poliovirus is one of the most well-characterized viruses, and has become a useful model system for understanding the biology of RNA viruses.

== Replication cycle ==
Poliovirus infects human cells by binding to an immunoglobulin-like receptor, CD155 (also known as the poliovirus receptor or PVR) on the cell surface. Interaction of poliovirus and CD155 facilitates an irreversible conformational change of the viral particle necessary for viral entry. Following attachment to the host cell membrane, entry of the viral nucleic acid was thought to occur one of two ways: via the formation of a pore in the plasma membrane through which the RNA is then &quot;injected&quot; into the host cell cytoplasm, or via virus uptake by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Recent experimental evidence supports the latter hypothesis and suggests that poliovirus binds to CD155 and is taken up by endocytosis. Immediately after internalization of the particle, the viral RNA is released.

Poliovirus is a positive-stranded RNA virus. Thus, the genome enclosed within the viral particle can be used as messenger RNA and immediately translated by the host cell. On entry, the virus hijacks the cell&#x27;s translation machinery, causing inhibition of cellular protein synthesis in favor of virus-specific protein production. Unlike the host cell&#x27;s mRNAs, the 5&#x27; end of poliovirus RNA is extremely long—over 700 nucleotides—and highly structured. This region of the viral genome is called an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). This region consists of many secondary structures and 3 or 4 domains. Domain 3 is a self folding RNA element that contains conserved structural motifs in various stable stem loops linked by two four-way junctions. As IRES consists of many domains, these domains themselves consist of many loops that contribute to modified translation without a 5’ end cap by hijacking ribosomes. The interaction loop of domain 3 is known as GNRA tetraloop. The residues of adenosines A180 and A181 in the GUAA tetraloop form hydrogen bonds via non canonical base pairing interactions with the base pairs of the receptors C230/G242 and G231/C241, respectively. Genetic mutations in this region prevent viral protein production. The first IRES to be discovered was found in poliovirus RNA.

Poliovirus mRNA is translated as one long polypeptide. This polypeptide is then autocleaved by internal proteases into about 10 individual viral proteins. Not all cleavages occur with the same efficiency. Therefore, the amounts of proteins produced by the polypeptide cleavage vary: for example, smaller amounts of 3Dpol are produced than those of capsid proteins, VP1–4. These individual viral proteins are:

*3Dpol, an RNA dependent RNA polymerase whose function is to make multiple copies of the viral RNA genome
*2Apro and 3Cpro/3CDpro, proteases which cleave the viral polypeptide
*VPg (3B), a small protein that binds viral RNA and is necessary for synthesis of viral positive and negative strand RNA
*2BC, 2B, 2C (an ATPase)&quot;, 3AB, 3A, 3B&quot; proteins which comprise the protein complex needed for virus replication.
*VP0, which is further cleaved into VP2 and VP4, VP1 and VP3, proteins of the viral capsid

After translation, transcription and genome replication which involve a single process, synthesis of (+) RNA) is realized. For the infecting (+)RNA to be replicated, multiple copies of (−)RNA must be transcribed and then used as templates for (+)RNA synthesis. Replicative intermediates (RIs), which are an association of RNA molecules consisting of a template RNA and several growing RNAs of varying length, are seen in both the replication complexes for (−)RNAs and (+)RNAs. For synthesis of each negative-strand and positive-strand RNAs, VPg protein in the poliovirus works as a primer. RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the poliovirus adds two uracil nucleotides (UU) to VPg protein utilizing the poly(A) tail at the 3′-end of the +ssRNA genome as a pattern for synthesis of the negative-strand antigenomic RNA. To initiate this −ssRNA synthesis, the tyrosine hydroxyl of VPg is needed. But for the initiation of positive strand RNA synthesis, CRE-dependent VPg uridylylation is needed. Which means that VPg is once more utilized as a primer however this time it adds the two uridine triphosphates using a cis-acting replication element (CRE) as a template. 

The CRE of poliovirus is identified as an unachieved base-paired stem and a final loop consisting of 61 nt. The CRE is found in enteroviruses. It is a highly preserved secondary RNA structural element and bedded in the genome&#x27;s polyprotein-coding region. The complex can be translocated to the 5&#x27; region of the genome that have no coding activity, at least 3.7-kb distant from the initial location. This process can occurs without negatively influencing activity. CRE copies do not influence replication negatively. Uridylylation process of VPg that takes place at CRE needs the presence of 3CDpro that is an RNA binding protein. It is attached to the CRE directly and specifically. Because of its presence VPg can bind the CRE properly and primary production proceeds without problems.

Some of the (+) RNA molecules are used as templates for further (−) RNA synthesis, some function as mRNA, and some are destined to be the genomes of progeny virions.

In the assembly of new virus particles (i.e. the packaging of progeny genome into a procapsid which can survive outside the host cell), including, respectively:
* Five copies each of VP0, VP3, and VP1 whose N termini and VP4 form interior surface of capsid, assemble into a &#x27;pentamer&#x27; and 12 pentamers form a procapsid. (The outer surface of capsid is consisting of VP1, VP2, VP3; C termini of VP1 and VP3 form the canyons which around each of the vertices; around this time, the 60 copies of VP0 are cleaved into VP4 and VP2.)
* Each procapsid acquires a copy of the virus genome, with VPg still attached at the 5&#x27; end.

Fully assembled poliovirus leaves the confines of its host cell by lysis 4 to 6 hours following initiation of infection in cultured mammalian cells. The mechanism of viral release from the cell is unclear, but each dying cell can release up to 10,000 polio virions.

Drake demonstrated that poliovirus is able to undergo multiplicity reactivation. That is, when polioviruses were irradiated with UV light and allowed to undergo multiple infections of host cells, viable progeny could be formed even at UV doses that inactivated the virus in single infections. Poliovirus can undergo genetic recombination when at least two viral genomes are present in the same host cell. Kirkegaard and Baltimore presented evidence that RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) catalyzes recombination by a copy choice mechanism in which the RdRP switches between (+)ssRNA templates during negative strand synthesis. Recombination in RNA viruses appears to be an adaptive mechanism for repairing genome damage.

== Origin and serotypes ==
Poliovirus is structurally similar to other human enteroviruses (coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and rhinoviruses), which also use immunoglobulin-like molecules to recognize and enter host cells. Phylogenetic analysis of the RNA and protein sequences of poliovirus suggests that it may have evolved from a C-cluster Coxsackie A virus ancestor through a mutation in the capsid. The distinct speciation of poliovirus probably occurred as a result of a change in cellular receptor specificity from intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (used by C-cluster Coxsackie A viruses) to CD155, leading to a change in pathogenicity and allowing the virus to infect nerve tissue.

The mutation rate in the virus is relatively high even for an RNA virus, with a synonymous substitution rate of substitutions/site/year and a
non-synonymous substitution rate of substitutions/site/year. Base distribution within the genome is not random; adenosine is less common than expected at the 5&#x27; end and higher at the 3&#x27; end. Codon use is not random; codons ending in adenosine are favoured, and those ending in cytosine or guanine are avoided. Codon use differs between the three genotypes, and appears to be driven by mutation rather than selection.

The three serotypes of poliovirus, PV-1, PV-2, and PV-3, each have a slightly different capsid protein. Capsid proteins define cellular receptor specificity and virus antigenicity. &quot;PV-1&quot; is the most common form encountered in nature, but all three forms are extremely infectious. As of March 2020, wild PV-1 is highly localized to regions in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Certification of the eradication of indigenous transmission of wild PV-2 occurred in September 2015, after last being detected in 1999, and in October 2019 for wild PV-3 after last being detected in 2012. However, circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (variant poliovirus, cVDPV) of all three serotypes continues to circulate and cause paralysis, having been detected in 32 countries in 2023.

Specific strains of each serotype are used to prepare vaccines against polio. Inactive polio vaccine is prepared by formalin inactivation of three wild, virulent reference strains: Mahoney or Brunenders (PV-1), MEF-1/Lansing (PV-2), and Saukett/Leon (PV-3). Oral polio vaccine contains live attenuated (weakened) strains of the three serotypes of poliovirus. Passaging the virus strains in monkey kidney epithelial cells introduces mutations in the viral IRES, and hinders (or attenuates) the ability of the virus to infect nerve tissue.

Polioviruses were formerly classified as a distinct species belonging to the genus &quot;Enterovirus&quot; in the family &quot;Picornaviridae&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Poliovirus&quot; ceased to be recognized as a species, and the three serotypes were assigned to the species &quot;Human enterovirus C&quot; (later renamed &quot;Enterovirus C&quot;) in the genus &quot;Enterovirus&quot; in the family &quot;Picornaviridae&quot;. The type species of the genus &quot;Enterovirus&quot; was changed from &quot;Poliovirus&quot; to .

== Pathogenesis ==

The primary determinant of infection for any virus is its ability to enter a cell and produce additional infectious particles. The presence of CD155 is thought to define the animals and tissues that can be infected by poliovirus. CD155 is found (outside of laboratories) only on the cells of humans, higher primates, and Old World monkeys. Poliovirus is, however, strictly a human pathogen, and does not naturally infect any other species (although chimpanzees and Old World monkeys can be experimentally infected).

The &quot;CD155&quot; gene appears to have been subject to positive selection. The protein has several domains of which domain D1 contains the polio virus binding site. Within this domain, 37 amino acids are responsible for binding the virus.

Poliovirus is an enterovirus. Infection occurs via the fecal–oral route, meaning that one ingests the virus and viral replication occurs in the gastrointestinal tract. Virus is shed in the feces of infected individuals. In 95% of cases only a primary, transient presence of viremia (virus in the bloodstream) occurs, and the poliovirus infection is asymptomatic. In about 5% of cases, the virus spreads and replicates in other sites such as brown fat, reticuloendothelial tissue, and muscle. The sustained viral replication causes secondary viremia and leads to the development of minor symptoms such as fever, headache, and sore throat. Paralytic poliomyelitis occurs in less than 1% of poliovirus infections. Paralytic disease occurs when the virus enters the central nervous system (CNS) and replicates in motor neurons within the spinal cord, brain stem, or motor cortex, resulting in the selective destruction of motor neurons leading to temporary or permanent paralysis. This is a very rare event in babies, who still have anti-poliovirus antibodies acquired from their mothers. In rare cases, paralytic poliomyelitis leads to respiratory arrest and death. In cases of paralytic disease, muscle pain and spasms are frequently observed prior to onset of weakness and paralysis. Paralysis typically persists from days to weeks prior to recovery.

In many respects, the neurological phase of infection is thought to be an accidental diversion of the normal gastrointestinal infection. The mechanisms by which poliovirus enters the CNS are poorly understood. Three nonmutually exclusive hypotheses have been suggested to explain its entry. All theories require primary viremia. The first hypothesis predicts that virions pass directly from the blood into the central nervous system by crossing the blood–brain barrier independent of CD155. A second hypothesis suggests that the virions are transported from peripheral tissues that have been bathed in the viremic blood, for example muscle tissue, to the spinal cord through nerve pathways via retrograde axonal transport. A third hypothesis is that the virus is imported into the CNS via infected monocytes or macrophages.

Poliomyelitis is a disease of the central nervous system. However, CD155 is believed to be present on the surface of most or all human cells. Therefore, receptor expression does not explain why poliovirus preferentially infects certain tissues. This suggests that tissue tropism is determined after cellular infection. Recent work has suggested that the type I interferon response (specifically that of interferon alpha and beta) is an important factor that defines which types of cells support poliovirus replication. In mice expressing CD155 (through genetic engineering) but lacking the type I interferon receptor, poliovirus not only replicates in an expanded repertoire of tissue types, but these mice are also able to be infected orally with the virus.

== Immune system avoidance ==
Poliovirus has two key mechanisms to evade the immune system. First, it can survive the highly acidic conditions of the stomach, allowing ingested viruses to infect the host and spread throughout the body via the lymphatic system. Second, because it can replicate very quickly, the virus overwhelms the host&#x27;s organs before an immune response can be mounted. If detail is given at the attachment phase; poliovirus with canyons on the virion surface have virus attachment sites located in pockets at the canyon bases. The canyons are too narrow for access by antibodies, so the virus attachment sites are protected from the host&#x27;s immune surveillance, while the remainder of the virion surface can mutate to avoid the host&#x27;s immune response.

Individuals who are exposed to poliovirus, either through infection or by immunization with polio vaccine, develop immunity. In immune individuals, antibodies against poliovirus are present in the tonsils and gastrointestinal tract (specifically IgA antibodies) and are able to block poliovirus replication; IgG and IgM antibodies against poliovirus can prevent the spread of the virus to motor neurons of the central nervous system. Infection with one serotype of poliovirus does not provide immunity against the other serotypes; however, second attacks within the same individual are extremely rare.

=== Transgenic mice ===
Although humans are the only known natural hosts of poliovirus, monkeys can be experimentally infected and they have long been used to study poliovirus. In 1990–91, a small animal model of poliomyelitis was developed by two laboratories. Mice were engineered to express a human receptor to poliovirus (hPVR).

Unlike normal mice, transgenic poliovirus receptor (TgPVR) mice are susceptible to poliovirus injected intravenously or intramuscularly, and when injected directly into the spinal cord or the brain. Upon infection, TgPVR mice show signs of paralysis that resemble those of poliomyelitis in humans and monkeys, and the central nervous systems of paralyzed mice are histocytochemically similar to those of humans and monkeys. This mouse model of human poliovirus infection has proven to be an invaluable tool in understanding poliovirus biology and pathogenicity.

Three distinct types of TgPVR mice have been well studied:

*In TgPVR1 mice, the transgene encoding the human PVR was incorporated into mouse chromosome 4. These mice express the highest levels of the transgene and the highest sensitivity to poliovirus. TgPVR1 mice are susceptible to poliovirus through the intraspinal, intracerebral, intramuscular, and intravenous pathways, but not through the oral route.
*TgPVR21 mice have incorporated the human PVR at chromosome 13. These mice are less susceptible to poliovirus infection through the intracerebral route, possibly because they express decreased levels of hPVR. TgPVR21 mice have been shown to be susceptible to poliovirus infection through intranasal inoculation, and may be useful as a mucosal infection model.
*In TgPVR5 mice, the human transgene is located on chromosome 12. These mice exhibit the lowest levels of hPVR expression and are the least susceptible to poliovirus infection.
*A fourth TgPVR mouse model - these &quot;cPVR&quot; mice carry hPVR cDNA, driven by a β-actin promoter, and have proven susceptible to poliovirus through intracerebral, intramuscular, and intranasal routes. In addition, these mice are capable of developing the bulbar form of polio after intranasal inoculation.

The development of the TgPVR mouse has had a profound effect on oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) production. Previously, monitoring the safety of OPV had to be performed using monkeys, because only primates are susceptible to the virus. In 1999, the World Health Organization approved the use of the TgPVR mouse as an alternative method of assessing the effectiveness of the vaccine against poliovirus type-3. In 2000, the mouse model was approved for tests of vaccines against type-1 and type-2 poliovirus.

=== Genetic modification ===
A modification of the poliovirus, called PVSRIPO, was tested in early clinical trials as a possible treatment for cancer. , a number of clinical trials are under way.

A drawback of the attenuated virus used in the Sabin oral polio vaccine is its potential to cause vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) in approximately one individual per every 2.7million doses administered. In addition, the live virus can also circulate in under-vaccinated populations (circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, cVDPV) and over time can revert to a neurovirulent form causing paralytic polio. Researchers have developed a poliovirus type 2 vaccine strain that is genetically more stable and less likely to regain virulence than the original Sabin2 strain, with three key genetic modifications. The vaccine derived from this strain, novel oral polio virus type 2 (nOPV2), was granted emergency licencing in 2021, and subsequently full licensure in December 2023. Genetically stabilsed vaccines targeting poliovirus types 1 and 3 are in development, with the intention that these will eventually completely replace the Sabin vaccines.

== History ==

=== Discovery ===
Poliovirus was first isolated in 1909 by Karl Landsteiner and Erwin Popper. The structure of the virus was first elucidated in 1958 using X-ray diffraction by a team at Birkbeck College led by Rosalind Franklin, showing the polio virus to have icosahedral symmetry.

=== Genome ===
In 1981, the poliovirus genome was published by two different teams of researchers: by Vincent Racaniello and David Baltimore at MIT and by Naomi Kitamura and Eckard Wimmer at Stony Brook University.

=== Structure ===
The three-dimensional structure of poliovirus was determined in 1985 by James Hogle at Scripps Research Institute using X-ray crystallography.

=== Cloning and synthesis ===

In 1981, Racaniello and Baltimore used recombinant DNA technology to generate the first infectious clone of an animal RNA virus, poliovirus. DNA encoding the RNA genome of poliovirus was introduced into cultured mammalian cells and infectious poliovirus was produced. Creation of the infectious clone propelled understanding of poliovirus biology, and has become a standard technology used to study many other viruses.

In 2002, Eckard Wimmer&#x27;s group at Stony Brook University succeeded in synthesizing poliovirus from its chemical code, producing the world&#x27;s first synthetic virus. Scientists first converted poliovirus&#x27;s published RNA sequence, 7741 bases long, into a DNA sequence, as DNA was easier to synthesize. Short fragments of this DNA sequence were obtained by mail-order, and assembled. The complete viral genome was then assembled by a gene synthesis company. Nineteen markers were incorporated into the synthesized DNA, so that it could be distinguished from natural poliovirus. Enzymes were used to convert the DNA back into RNA, its natural state. Other enzymes were then used to translate the RNA into a polypeptide, producing functional viral particle. This whole painstaking process took two years. The newly minted synthetic virus was injected into PVR transgenic mice, to determine if the synthetic version was able to cause disease. The synthetic virus was able to replicate, infect, and cause paralysis or death in mice. However, the synthetic version was between 1,000 and 10,000 times weaker than the original virus, probably due to one of the added markers.

<text>The Urticaceae are a family, the nettle family, of flowering plants. The family name comes from the genus &quot;Urtica&quot;. The Urticaceae include a number of well-known and useful plants, including nettles in the genus &quot;Urtica&quot;, ramie (&quot;Boehmeria nivea&quot;), māmaki (&quot;Pipturus albidus&quot;), and ajlai (&quot;Debregeasia saeneb&quot;).

The family includes about 2,625 species, grouped into 53 genera according to the database of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and Christenhusz and Byng (2016). The largest genera are &quot;Pilea&quot; (500 to 715 species), &quot;Elatostema&quot; (300 species), &quot;Urtica&quot; (80 species), and &quot;Cecropia&quot; (75 species). &quot;Cecropia&quot; contains many myrmecophytes.

Urticaceae species can be found worldwide, apart from the polar regions.

== Description ==
Urticaceae species can be shrubs (e.g. &quot;Pilea&quot;), lianas, herbs (e.g. &quot;Urtica&quot;, &quot;Parietaria&quot;), or, rarely, trees (&quot;Dendrocnide&quot;, &quot;Cecropia&quot;). Their leaves are usually entire and bear stipules. Urticating (stinging) hairs are often present. They have usually unisexual flowers and can be both monoecious or dioecious. They are wind-pollinated. Most disperse their pollen when the stamens are mature and their filaments straighten explosively, a peculiar and conspicuously specialised mechanism.

While the stings delivered by Urticaceae species are often unpleasant, they seldom pose any direct threat to health, and deaths directly attributed to stinging are exceedingly rare; species known to cause human fatalities include &quot;Dendrocnide cordata&quot; and &quot;Urtica ferox&quot;.

== Taxonomy ==

The APG II system puts the Urticaceae in the order Rosales, while older systems consider them part of the Urticales, along with Ulmaceae, Moraceae, and Cannabaceae. APG still considers &quot;old&quot; Urticales a monophyletic group, but does not recognise it as an order on its own.

==Fossil record==
The fossil record of Urticaceae is scattered and mostly based on dispersed fruits. Twelve species based on fossil achenes are known from the Late Cretaceous of Central Europe. Most were assigned to the extant genera &quot;Boehmeria&quot; (three species), &quot;Debregeasia&quot; (one species) and &quot;Pouzolzia&quot; (three species), while three species were assigned to the extinct genus &quot;Urticoidea&quot;. A Colombian fossil flora of the Maastrichtian stage has yielded leaves that resemble leaves of the tribe Ceropieae. In the Cenozoic fossil leaves from the Ypresian Allenby Formation preserve distinct trichomes, and have been attributed to the Tribe Urticeae in the fossil record. The leaves had originally been identified as &quot;Rubus&quot; by earlier workers on the Eocene Okanagan Highlands, but Devore &quot;et al&quot; (2020) interpreted the preserved hairs along the stem and major veins as stinging trichomes, rather than simple hairs or thorns.

==Diseases==
The Urticaceae are subject to many bacterial, viral, fungal, and nematode parasitic diseases. Among them are:
* Bacterial leaf spot, caused by &quot;Xanthomonas campestris&quot; which affects &quot;Pellionia&quot;, &quot;Pilea&quot;, and other genera
* Anthracnose, a fungal disease caused by &quot;Colletotrichum capsici&quot; which affects &quot;Pilea&quot;
* Myrothecium leaf spot, a fungal disease caused by &quot;Myrothecium roridum&quot; which affects plants throughout the Urticaceae, as well as other angiosperms
* Phytophthora blight, a water mold disease caused by &quot;Phytophthora nicotianae&quot; which affects &quot;Pilea&quot;
* Southern blight, a fungal disease caused by &quot;Athelia rolfsii&quot; which affects both &quot;Pellionia&quot; and &quot;Pilea&quot;

<text>Isabella I (1172 – 5 April 1205) reigned as Queen of Jerusalem from 1190 to her death in 1205. She was the daughter of Amalric I of Jerusalem and his second wife Maria Comnena, a Byzantine princess. Her half-brother, Baldwin IV of Jerusalem, engaged her to Humphrey IV of Toron. Her mother&#x27;s second husband, Balian of Ibelin, and his stepfather, Raynald of Châtillon, were influential members of the two baronial parties. The marriage of Isabella and Humphrey was celebrated in Kerak Castle in autumn 1183. Saladin, the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt and Syria, laid siege to the fortress during the wedding, but Baldwin IV forced him to lift the siege.

Baldwin IV, who suffered from lepromatous leprosy, had made his nephew (the only son of his sister, Sibylla by her first husband), Baldwin V, his heir and co-ruler, to prevent Sibylla&#x27;s second husband, Guy of Lusignan, from mounting the throne. The High Court of Jerusalem stipulated that a committee of Western European rulers was entitled to choose between Sibylla and Isabella to succeed Baldwin V if he died before reaching the age of majority, but Sibylla and Guy were crowned soon after Baldwin V died in 1185. Guy&#x27;s opponents tried to play Isabella and her husband off against him, but Humphrey did homage to the royal couple.

== Early life ==

=== Childhood ===

Isabella was the daughter of Amalric, King of Jerusalem, by his second wife, Maria Comnena. Maria Comnena (who was a grandniece of the Byzantine emperor, Manuel I Komnenos) married Amalric on 29 August 1167. Isabella was born before September 1172.

Amalric died unexpectedly on 11 July 1174. His son by his first marriage, Baldwin IV, was crowned king two weeks later. Before long, it became obvious that Baldwin suffered from lepromatous leprosy. To secure the succession to the ailing king, his sister, Sibylla, was given in marriage to William of Montferrat in November 1176, but he died seven months later. Baldwin&#x27;s cousin Count Philip I of Flanders, who landed at Acre in August, offered Robert of Bethune for Sibylla&#x27;s new husband, also proposing that Isabella (who was Baldwin&#x27;s and Sibylla&#x27;s half-sister) should marry Robert&#x27;s younger brother, William of Bethune. The High Court of Jerusalem refused both proposals.

Isabella&#x27;s mother married Balian of Ibelin in autumn 1177. His brother, Baldwin of Ibelin, wanted to marry Sibylla, but the king preferred another candidate, Guy of Lusignan. After the marriage of Sibylla and Guy on Easter 1180, a division emerged between Guy of Lusignan&#x27;s supporters and opponents. The first group included the mother of Baldwin IV and Sibylla, Agnes of Courtenay, her brother, Joscelin, and Raynald of Châtillon, Lord of Oultrejordain. Their opponents included Isabella&#x27;s mother and stepfather, and Raymond III of Tripoli. To secure Guy&#x27;s position, the king arranged the betrothal of Isabella to Raynald of Châtillon&#x27;s stepson, Humphrey IV of Toron in October 1180. Isabella was sent to Kerak Castle to be educated by Humphrey&#x27;s mother, Stephanie of Milly. Stephanie forbade her to pay visits to her mother and stepfather at Nablus.

The relationship between Baldwin IV and Guy of Lusignan deteriorated. Baldwin IV removed Guy from the regency and denied his right of succession, making Guy&#x27;s stepson (Sibylla&#x27;s son from her first marriage), Baldwin V, his heir and co-ruler on 20 November 1183. A version of Ernoul&#x27;s chronicle suggests that the child Baldwin V was made heir, because the ailing Baldwin IV wanted to avoid a debate between his sisters&#x27; supporters about his succession. Guy&#x27;s principal supporters, Joscelin of Courtenay and Raynald of Châtillon, were not present at Baldwin V&#x27;s coronation, because they attended the wedding of Isabella and Humphrey of Toron.

=== First marriage ===

The wedding took place in Kerak Castle. Saladin, the Ayyubid sultan of Egypt and Syria, laid siege to the fortress. According to Ernoul&#x27;s chronicle, Stephanie of Milly sent meals to the besiegers from the feast and Saladin forbade his engineers to destroy the tower of the fortress in which Humphrey and Isabella spent the wedding night. Baldwin IV assembled a relief army and departed from Jerusalem to Kerak, although he was unable to ride a horse. Saladin lifted the siege and retreated without a fight on 3 or 4 December.

The dying Baldwin IV appointed Raymond of Tripoli regent for Baldwin V in April 1185. On Raymond&#x27;s demand, the High Court of Jerusalem ruled that a committee consisting of the pope, the Holy Roman Emperor and the kings of France and England would be entitled to choose between Sibylla and Isabella if Baldwin V died before reaching the age of majority. Baldwin IV died on 16 March 1185. About a year and a half later (before mid-September 1186) the child Baldwin V also died.

Sibylla&#x27;s uncle Joscelin of Courtenay persuaded Raymond III of Tripoli and his allies to leave Jerusalem, and urged her supporters (including Raynald of Châtillon) to assemble in the town. Ignoring the 1185 ruling of the High Court, the noblemen and prelates who came to Jerusalem concluded that Sibylla was the lawful heir to her son. Those who were opposed to Sibylla (including Raymond III of Tripoli and Balian of Ibelin) assembled in Nablus. They argued that Sibylla&#x27;s legitimacy was dubious, because her parents&#x27; marriage had been annulled. They also emphasized that Isabella was born after the coronation of her father. They sent envoys to Jerusalem to protest against Sibylla&#x27;s coronation, but Heraclius, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, crowned her in mid-September. Heraclius also anointed Guy of Lusignan king after she placed a crown on Guy&#x27;s head.

On Raymond of Tripoli&#x27;s proposal, the noblemen who assembled in Nablus decided that they proclaim Isabella and Humphrey of Toron queen and king. However, Humphrey (whose mother and stepfather were Sibylla&#x27;s supporters) fled from Nablus to Jerusalem and did homage to Sibylla and Guy. Before long, all barons followed his example and swore fealty to the queen and her husband, with the exception of Raymond of Tripoli who left the kingdom.

Saladin imposed a crushing defeat on the united army of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in the Battle of Hattin on 4 July 1187. Isabella&#x27;s husband was captured on the battlefield. Before long, Saladin&#x27;s troops seized most towns and fortresses of the Kingdom of Jerusalem: Tiberias fell soon after the battle, Acre on 9 July, Beirut before 6 August, and Jerusalem on 2 October. Tyre was an exception, holding out for months under the command of Conrad of Montferrat who had come to the Holy Land from Italy a few weeks after the battle.

Conrad regarded himself as the ruler of Tyre, forbidding Guy of Lusignan to enter the town in the summer of 1189. Guy laid siege to Acre, but James of Avesnes, Louis III of Thuringia and other crusader commanders who came to the Holy Land also questioned his claim to leadership. Guy&#x27;s wife, Sibylla, and their two daughters died in the autumn of 1190. Guy&#x27;s opponents argued that he had only been king by marriage, and his wife&#x27;s half-sister, Isabella, inherited the crown. Guy did not want to abandon his claim to the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Taking advantage of the situation, Conrad of Montferrat decided to marry Isabella.

Isabella&#x27;s stepfather supported Conrad&#x27;s plan. Isabella resisted, but her mother put her under pressure. Maria Komnena also swore that Baldwin IV had forced the eight-year-old Isabella to marry Humphrey of Toron, whose effeminacy was well known. Before long, the papal legate, Ubaldo Lanfranchi, Archbishop of Pisa, and Philip of Dreux, Bishop of Beauvais, annulled the marriage of Isabella and Humphrey. Baldwin of Forde, Archbishop of Canterbury, forbade her to marry Conrad, stating that both Isabella and Conrad would commit adultery if they married. However, Baldwin of Forde died on 19 November 1190.

=== Second marriage ===

Conrad married Isabella on 24 November. Isabella returned to Humphrey the Lordship of Toron that Baldwin IV had annexed to the crown in 1180. Guy of Lusignan refused to abdicate, but most barons regarded him as the lawful monarch. Conrad and Isabella returned to Tyre. After Philip II of France, who landed at Acre on 20 April 1191, acknowledged Conrad&#x27;s claim to Jerusalem, Guy of Lusignan and Conrad&#x27;s opponents (including Humphrey of Toron and Bohemond III of Antioch) sought assistance from Richard I of England, who decided to support them. Guy adopted the title of &quot;king-elect of Jerusalem&quot; in May.

The crusaders captured Acre on 11 July 1191. On 28 July, Richard and Philip agreed that Guy could retain the title of king till the end of his life, but Conrad would rule Tyre, Beirut and Sidon; after Guy&#x27;s death, the kingdom would be united under the rule of Conrad and Isabella or their issue. Three days later, Philip left for France and Richard became the sole supreme commander of the crusaders. The native barons remained hostile towards Guy. After Richard decided to return to England in April 1192, the barons urged him to revise the previous decision about the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

== Reign ==

=== Election ===

Richard held an assembly on 16 April 1192. The prelates and the noblemen who attended the meeting unanimously voted for Conrad. Richard accepted their decision, granting Cyprus to Guy in compensation for his lost kingdom. Richard dispatched his nephew Count Henry II of Champagne to inform Conrad about the barons&#x27; decision. Henry arrived at Tyre about four days later. It was agreed that Conrad and Isabella would be crowned at Acre.

Isabella, who loved lingering in her bath, spent unusually much time there on 28 April. Being hungry, Conrad decided to have a dinner with Philip of Dreux, but by the time he arrived at Philip&#x27;s house, the bishop had already finished his meal. Conrad wanted to return home, but two men ambushed and stabbed him in a narrow street. Most sources agree that they were sent by Rashid ad-Din Sinan, head of the Assassins. While dying, Conrad ordered Isabella not to give Tyre to anyone but Richard or to the new king of Jerusalem. When Duke Hugh III of Burgundy, the French king&#x27;s lieutenant in the Holy Land, urged Isabella to deliver Tyre to him, she shut herself up in the fortress and refused to open its gates.

=== Third marriage ===

On learning of Conrad&#x27;s assassination, Henry of Champagne, who had meanwhile returned to Acre, hurried back to Tyre. Henry, who was the nephew of both Richard of England and Philip of France, was acclaimed king by the barons and the citizens of Tyre. According to Ernoul, Henry was hesitant, because Isabella was pregnant, possibly with a son. The barons and the citizens, continued Ernoul, promised him that his children would inherit the Kingdom of Jerusalem to convince him to accept the crown. The betrothal of Henry and Isabella was announced two days after Conrad&#x27;s death. The marriage was celebrated in Acre on 10 May 1192.

Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani, who was present at the wedding, wrote:

Isabella and Conrad&#x27;s child, Maria of Montferrat, was born in 1192. Henry and Isabella then had three daughters, Margaret (born 1193/1194), Alice (born 1196) and Philippa (born 1197). Henry died in 1197 when a balcony or window-trellis gave way and he fell out of a window.

=== Fourth marriage ===
After his death, Isabella married for a fourth time to Aimery of Cyprus, brother of Guy of Lusignan. They were crowned together as King and Queen of Jerusalem in January 1198 in Acre. They had two daughters, Sibylla (born 1198) and Melisende (born 1200), and one son, Amalric (born 1201). King Aimery died in 1205 of food poisoning caused by white mullet, four days before his wife, and shortly after their son. On her death on 5 April 1205, Isabella was succeeded as queen by her eldest daughter Maria.

The legality of Isabella&#x27;s divorce from Humphrey was challenged in 1213, during the dispute over the succession to Champagne between her daughters Alice and Philippa and Henry&#x27;s nephew Theobald IV. However, its validity seems to have been upheld: no challenge was made to the legitimacy of Maria and her descendants to succeed to the throne of Jerusalem, and in Champagne, Theobald bought off his cousins Alice and Philippa.

== Family ==

Isabella&#x27;s first marriage to Humphrey IV of Toron was childless.

From her second marriage to Conrad of Montferrat she had one daughter:
#Maria (1192–1212), succeeded Isabella as Queen of Jerusalem.

From her third marriage to Henry II of Champagne she had three daughters:
#Margaret (1193/1194 – before 1205) betrothed to Guy of Cyprus but they both died as children.
#Alice (1195/1196–1246), firstly married Hugh I of Cyprus, secondly she married Bohemond V of Antioch and thirdly married Raoul de Soissons. She was a rival claimant of Champagne.
#Philippa (c. 1197 – 20 December 1250), married Erard de Brienne-Ramerupt and was also a claimant of Champagne.

From her fourth and final marriage to Aimery of Cyprus she had the following children:
# Sibylla (October–November 1198 – c. 1230 or 1252), married King Leo I of Armenia 
# Melisende (c. 1200 – aft. 1249), married 1 January 1218 Bohemund IV of Antioch 
# Amalric (1201 – 2 February 1205, Acre)

== Ancestry ==
== In popular culture ==
Isabella has made few fictional appearances, but she is a major character in Graham Shelby&#x27;s &quot;The Knights of Dark Renown&quot; (1969) and its sequel &quot;The Kings of Vain Intent&quot; (1970). Shelby idealises her marriage to Humphrey, depicting them as his young romantic leads. He then goes on to depict her being beaten and raped by Conrad in a sadistically abusive relationship. This sensationalist depiction is not supported by any evidence. Shelby implies that Isabella plotted Conrad&#x27;s murder in revenge for his abuse, and depicts her as mentally numbed and indifferent to Henry.

She is the title character of Alan Gordon&#x27;s mystery novel, &quot;The Widow of Jerusalem&quot; (2003), which paints a more sympathetic portrait of her marriage to Conrad. She is introduced as a spoilt, vain young woman, but she matures in the course of the story. Only when it is too late does she realise that her husband loves her. His murder, and the later death of Henry, are investigated by the hero, the fool Theophilos (Feste).

She is positively portrayed as a child and young woman in Sharon Kay Penman&#x27;s &quot;The Land Beyond the Sea&quot;.

<text>Wrist drop is a medical condition in which the wrist and the fingers cannot extend at the metacarpophalangeal joints. The wrist remains partially flexed due to an opposing action of flexor muscles of the forearm. As a result, the extensor muscles in the posterior compartment remain paralyzed.

== Forearm anatomy ==
The forearm is the part of the body that extends from the elbow to the wrist and is not to be confused with the arm, which extends from the shoulder to the elbow. 

The extensor muscles in the forearm are the extensor carpi ulnaris, extensor digiti minimi, extensor digitorum, extensor indicis, extensor carpi radialis brevis, and extensor carpi radialis longus. These extensor muscles are supplied by the posterior interosseous nerve, a branch of the radial nerve. Other muscles in the forearm that are innervated by this nerve are the supinator, extensor pollicis brevis, extensor pollicis longus and abductor pollicis longus. All of these muscles are situated in the posterior half of the forearm (posterior is when it is in its standard anatomical position). Also, the brachioradialis, anconeus, triceps brachii and extensor carpi radialis longus are all innervated by muscular branches of the radial nerve in the arm.

==Causes==
Wrist extension is achieved by muscles in the forearm contracting, pulling on tendons that attach distal to (beyond) the wrist. If the tendons, muscles, or nerves supplying these muscles are damaged or otherwise not working as they should be, wrist drop may occur.

The following situations may result in wrist drop:
* Stab wounds to the chest at or below the clavicle–The radial nerve is the terminal branch of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. A stab wound may damage the posterior cord and result in neurological deficits, including an inability to abduct the shoulder beyond the first 15 degrees, an inability to extend the forearm, reduced ability to supinate the hand, reduced ability to abduct the thumb and sensory loss to the posterior surface of the arm and hand.
* Broken humerus–The radial nerve can be damaged if the humerus (the bone of the arm) is broken because it runs through the radial groove on the lateral border of this bone along with the deep brachial artery.
* Lead poisoning–Wrist drop is associated with lead poisoning due to the effect of lead on the radial nerve.
* Persistent injury–Persistent injury to the nerve is a common cause through either repetitive motion or by applying pressure externally along the route of the radial nerve as in the prolonged use of crutches, extended leaning on the elbows, or regular upper body rope suspension. The colloquial terms for radial nerve palsy are derived from this cause. 
* Correcting dislocated shoulders–Radial nerve palsy can result from the now discredited practice of correcting a dislocated shoulder by putting a foot in the person&#x27;s armpit and pulling on the arm in attempts to slide the humerus back into the glenoid cavity of the scapula.
* Neuropathy in the hands and/or arms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis may in rare cases cause wrist drop. &quot;When a joint swells, it can pinch the nerves of sensation that pass next to it. If the swelling irritates the nerve, either because of the inflammation or simply because of pressure, the nerve can send sensations of pain, numbness, and/or tingling to the brain. This is called nerve entrapment. Nerve entrapment most frequently occurs at the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome) and elbow (ulnar nerve entrapment). A rare form of nerve disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis that causes numbness and/or tingling is neuropathy. Neuropathy is nerve damage that in people with rheumatoid arthritis can result from inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis).&quot;

== Types ==
Types of wrist drop are distinguished by the nerves affected:
* Weakness of brachioradialis, wrist extension and finger flexion = radial nerve lesion
* Weakness of finger extension and radial deviation of the wrist on extension = posterior interosseous nerve lesion
* Weakness of triceps, finger extensors and flexors = c7,8 lesion
* General weakness of upper limb marked in deltoid, triceps, wrist extension and finger extension = corticospinal lesion

==Diagnosis==
The workup for wrist drop frequently includes nerve conduction velocity studies to isolate and confirm the radial nerve as the source of the problem. Other screening tests include the inability to extend the thumb into a &quot;hitchhiker&#x27;s sign&quot;. Plain films can help identify bone spurs and fractures that may have injured the nerve. Sometimes MRI imaging is required to differentiate subtle causes.

==Treatment==
Initial treatment includes splinting of the wrist for support, along with osteopathic medicine, physiotherapy and occupational therapy. In some cases, surgical removal of bone spurs or other anatomical defects that may be impinging on the nerve might be warranted. If the injury was the result of pressure from prolonged use of improperly fitted crutches or other similar mechanisms of injury, then the symptoms of wrist drop will most likely resolve spontaneously within 8–12 weeks.

<text>In music, sight-reading, also called a prima vista (Italian meaning, &quot;at first sight&quot;), is the practice of reading and performing of a piece in a music notation that the performer has not seen or learned before. Sight-singing is used to describe a singer who is sight-reading. Both activities require the musician to play or sing the notated rhythms and pitches.

==Terminology==

===Sight-reading===
In music literature, the term &quot;sight-reading&quot; is often used in a generic sense to refer to the ability to read and perform instrumental and vocal music at first sight, which involves converting musical information from sight to sound. However, some authors, including Udtaisuk, prefer to use more specific terms such as &quot;sight-playing&quot; and &quot;sight-singing&quot; when applicable. This distinction allows for a narrower usage of the term &quot;sight-reading&quot; to describe the silent reading of music without producing sound through an instrument or voice.

Highly skilled musicians can sight-read &quot;silently&quot;; that is, they can look at the printed music and hear it in their heads without playing or singing (see audiation). Less able sight-readers generally must at least hum or whistle in order to sight-read effectively. This distinction is analogous to ordinary prose reading in late antiquity, when the ability to read silently was notable enough for Augustine of Hippo to comment on it.

The term &quot;a prima vista&quot; is also used, as Italian words and phrases are commonly used in music and music notation. To play a musical piece &quot;a prima vista&quot; means to play it &#x27;at first sight&#x27;. According to Payne, &quot;the ability to hear the notes on the page is clearly akin to music reading and should be considered a prerequisite for effective performance ... Egregious errors can occur when a student, analyzing a piece of music, makes no effort to play or hear the composition but mechanically processes the notes on the page.&quot;

Music schools generally require sight-reading as part of an audition or an exam.

===Sight transposition===

Some musicians can transpose music during performance to suit particular instruments or vocal ranges, to make the playing of the instrument(s) or singing easier, or a number of other uses. For transposing instruments such as the clarinets, trumpets, saxophones, and others, transposing is a necessary skill; for all musicians, it is a useful one.

===Sight-playing===
According to Udtaisuk, &quot;many [authors] use the term sight-reading for instrumental sight-reading performance&quot;. However, Udtaisuk and some other authors use the more descriptive term &quot;sightplaying&quot; (or &quot;sight-playing&quot;) for instrumental sight-reading, because sight-playing combines two unique skill sets: music reading and music making.

===Sight-singing===
Some authors, according to Udtaisuk, use the term &quot;sight-singing&quot; for vocal sight-reading. As with sight-playing, Udtaisuk advocates and uses the more descriptive term &quot;sightsinging&quot; for vocal sight-reading because sight-singing combines sight-reading and singing skills.

==Psychology==
The ability to sight-read partly depends on a strong short-term musical memory. An experiment on sight reading using an eye tracker indicates that highly skilled musicians tend to look ahead further in the music, storing and processing the notes until they are played; this is referred to as the eye–hand span.

Storage of notational information in working memory can be expressed in terms of the amount of information (load) and the time for which it must be held before being played (latency). The relationship between load and latency changes according to tempo, such that t = x/y, where t is the change in tempo, x is the change in load, and y is the change in latency. Some teachers and researchers have proposed that the eye–hand span can be trained to be larger than it would otherwise be under normal conditions, leading to more robust sight-reading ability.

Human memory can be divided into three broad categories: long-term memory, sensory memory, and short-term (working) memory. According to the formal definition, working memory is &quot;a system for temporarily storing and managing the information required to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning, reasoning, and comprehension&quot;. The paramount feature that distinguishes the working memory from both the long-term and sensory memory is this system&#x27;s ability to simultaneously process and store information. The knowledge has what is called a &quot;limited capacity&quot;, so there is only a certain amount of information that can be stored and it is easily accessible for only a small window of time after it has been processed, with a recall time block of roughly fifteen seconds to one minute.

Experiments dealing with memory span have been conducted by George Miller in 1956 that indicated, &quot;Most common number of items that can be stored in the working memory is five plus or minus two.” However, if this information is not retained and stored (“consolidated”) in one&#x27;s long-term memory, it will fade quickly.

Research indicates that the main area of the brain associated with the working memory is the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is located in the frontal lobe of the brain. This area deals with cognition and contains two major neural loops or pathways that are central to processing tasks via the working memory: the visual loop, which is necessary for the visual component of the task, and the phonological loop, which deals with the linguistic aspects of the task (i.e. repeating the word or phrase). Although the hippocampus, in the temporal lobe, is the brain structure most frequently paired with memories, studies have indicated that its role is more vital for consolidation of the short-term memories into long-term ones than the ability to process, carry out, and briefly recall certain tasks.

This type of memory has specifically come into focus when discussing sight reading, since the process of looking at musical notes for the first time and deciphering them while playing an instrument can be considered a complex task of comprehension. The main conclusion in terms of this idea is that working memory, short-term memory capacity and mental speed are three important predictors for sight reading achievement. Although none of the studies discredits the correlation between the amount of time one spends practicing and musical ability, specifically sight-reading proficiency, more studies are pointing to the level at which one’s working memory functions as the key factor in sight-reading abilities. As stated in one such study, &quot;Working memory capacity made a statistically significant contribution as well (about 7 percent, a medium-size effect). In other words, if you took two pianists with the same amount of practice, but different levels of working memory capacity, it&#x27;s likely that the one higher in working memory capacity would have performed considerably better on the sight-reading task.&quot;

Based on the research and opinions of multiple musicians and scientists, the take home message about one&#x27;s sight-reading ability and working memory capacity seems to be that “The best sight-readers combined strong working memories with tens of thousands of hours of practice.”

Sight-reading also depends on familiarity with the musical idiom being performed; this permits the reader to recognize and process frequently occurring patterns of notes as a single unit, rather than individual notes, thus achieving greater efficiency. This phenomenon, which also applies to the reading of language, is referred to as chunking. Errors in sight-reading tend to occur in places where the music contains unexpected or unusual sequences; these defeat the strategy of &quot;reading by expectation&quot; that sight-readers typically employ.

==Professional use==
Studio musicians (e.g., musicians employed to record pieces for commercials, etc.) often record pieces on the first take without having seen them before. Often, the music played on television is played by musicians who are sight-reading. This practice has developed through intense commercial competition in these industries.

Kevin McNerney, jazz musician, professor, and private instructor, describes auditions for University of North Texas Jazz Lab Bands as being almost completely based on sight-reading: &quot;you walk into a room and see three or four music stands in front of you, each with a piece of music on it (in different styles ...). You are then asked to read each piece in succession.&quot;

This emphasis on sight-reading, according to McNerney, prepares musicians for studio work &quot;playing backing tracks for pop performers or recording [commercials]&quot;. The expense of the studio, musicians, and techs makes sight-reading skills essential. Typically, a studio performance is &quot;rehearsed&quot; only once to check for copying errors before recording the final track. Many professional big bands also sight-read every live performance. They are known as &quot;rehearsal bands&quot;, even though their performance is the rehearsal.

According to Frazier, score reading is an important skill for those interested in the conducting profession and &quot;Conductors such as the late Robert Shaw and Yoel Levi have incredibly strong piano skills and can read at sight full orchestral scores at the piano&quot; (a process which requires the pianist to make an instant piano reduction of the key parts of the score).

==Pedagogy==
Although 86% of piano teachers polled rated sight-reading as the most important or a highly important skill, only 7% of them said they address it systematically. Reasons cited were a lack of knowledge of how to teach it, inadequacy of the training materials they use, and deficiency in their own sight-reading skills. Teachers also often emphasize rehearsed reading and repertoire building for successful recitals and auditions to the detriment of sight-reading and other functional skills.

Hardy reviewed research on piano sight-reading pedagogy and identified a number of specific skills essential to sight-reading proficiency:
* Technical fundamentals in reading and fingering
* Visualization of keyboard topography
* Tactile facility (psychomotor skills) and memory
* Ability to read, recognize, and remember groups of notes (directions, patterns, phrases, chords, rhythmic groupings, themes, inversions, intervals, etc.)
* Ability to read and remember ahead of playing with more and wider progressive fixations
* Aural imagery (ear-playing and sight-singing improves sight-reading)
* Ability to keep the basic pulse, read, and remember rhythm
* Awareness and knowledge of the music&#x27;s structure and theory

Beauchamp identifies five building blocks in the development of piano sight-reading skills:
# Grand-staff knowledge
# Security within the five finger positions
# Security with keyboard topography
# Security with basic accompaniment patterns
# Understanding of basic fingering principles

Grand-staff knowledge consists of fluency in both clefs such that reading a note evokes an automatic and immediate physical response to the appropriate position on the keyboard. Beauchamp asserts it is better to sense and know where the note is than what the note is. The performer does not have time to think of the note name and translate it to a position, and the non-scientific note name does not indicate the octave to be played. Beauchamp reports success using a Key/Note Visualizer, note-reading flashcards, and computer programs in group and individual practice to develop grand-staff fluency.

Udtaisuk also reports that a sense of keyboard geography and an ability to quickly and efficiently match notes to keyboard keys is important for sight-reading. He found that &quot;computer programs and flash cards are effective ways to teach students to identify notes [and] enhance a sense of keyboard geography by highlighting the relationships between the keyboard and the printed notation&quot;.

Most students do not sight-read well because it requires specific instruction, which is seldom given. A major challenge in sight-reading instruction, according to Hardy, is obtaining enough practice material. Since practicing rehearsed reading does not help improve sight-reading, a student can only use a practice piece once. Moreover, the material must be at just the right level of difficulty for each student, and a variety of styles is preferred. Hardy suggests music teachers cooperate to build a large lending library of music and purchase inexpensive music from garage sales and store sales.

==Assessment and standards==
In some circumstances, such as examinations, the ability of a student to sight-read is assessed by presenting the student with a short piece of music, with an allotted time to peruse the music, then testing the student on the accuracy of the performance. A more challenging test requires the student to perform without any preparation at all.

The Washington Assessment of Student Learning has piloted a classroom based assessment which requires 5th and higher grade students to sight-sing or perform on instruments from sheet music they have written. It is suggested that students use solfege or numbering systems or fingering without instruments as aids. 8th graders are expected to sing by sight: &quot;Students are asked to perform a sight-singing exercise of four measures of music. Students will be assessed on their understanding of rhythm and steady beat and their ability to perform in the designated key with accurate interval changes, a cappella.&quot;

Many students and adults cannot sight-sing, and even some professional singers cannot sing by sight. However, in combination with an assessment which requires composing music on a staff as early as 5th grade, it is hoped that such a requirement will raise arts achievement. Pilot data show that many students can meet or exceed such standards.

The Standard Assessment of Sight Reading (SASR) is a non-subjective sight reading evaluation method. It was created with a scientific/electronic platform to ensure a non-subjective approach to grading and administering that test. It consists of several thousand pieces of music over 80 graded levels of difficulty that have been reviewed by 135 teachers and students to ascertain the correct difficulty levels. Their scores were averaged electronically in order to insure a scientific approach to graduating the difficulty levels of the music.

<doc id="357787" wikidata="Q2208940" url="?curid=357787" title="Taishanese">
<text>Taishanese (), alternatively romanized in Cantonese as Toishanese or Toisanese, in local dialect as Hoisanese or Hoisanwa, is a Yue Chinese language native to Taishan, Guangdong. 

Even though they are related, Taishanese has little mutual intelligibility with Cantonese. It is not a dialect of Cantonese. Taishanese is also spoken throughout Sze Yup (or Siyi in the pinyin romanization of Standard Mandarin Chinese), located on the western fringe of the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong, China. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, most of the Chinese emigration to North America originated from Sze Yup (which includes Taishan). Thus, up to the mid-20th century, Taishanese was the dominant variety of the Chinese language spoken in Chinatowns in Canada and the United States. It was formerly the lingua franca of the overseas Chinese residing in the United States.

== Names ==
The earliest linguistic studies refer to the dialect of &quot;Llin-nen&quot; or &quot;Xinning&quot; (). Xinning was renamed Taishan in 1914, and linguistic literature has since generally referred to the local dialect as the &quot;Taishan dialect&quot;, a term based on the pinyin romanization of Standard Mandarin Chinese pronunciation. Alternative names have also been used. The term &quot;Toishan&quot; is a convention used by the United States Postal Service, the Defense Language Institute and the 2000 United States Census. The terms &quot;Toishan&quot;, &quot;Toisan&quot;, and &quot;Toisaan&quot; are all based on Cantonese pronunciation and are also frequently found in linguistic and non-linguistic literature. &quot;Hoisan&quot; is a term based on the local pronunciation, although it is not generally used in published literature.

These terms have also been anglicized with the suffix &quot;&quot;: &quot;Taishanese&quot;, &quot;Toishanese&quot;, and &quot;Toisanese&quot;. Of the previous three terms, &quot;Taishanese&quot; is most commonly used in academic literature, to about the same extent as the term &quot;Taishan dialect&quot;. The terms &quot;Hoisanese&quot; and &quot;Hoisan-wa&quot; do appear in print literature, although they are used more on the internet.

Another term used is &quot;Sìyì&quot; (&quot;Sze Yup&quot; or &quot;Seiyap&quot; in Cantonese romanization; ). Sìyì or Sze Yup refers to a previous administrative division in the Pearl River Delta consisting of the four counties of Taishan, Kaiping, Enping and Xinhui. In 1983, a fifth county (Heshan) was added to the Jiangmen prefecture; so whereas the term Sìyì has become an anachronism, the older term Sze Yup remains in current use in overseas Chinese communities where it is their ancestral home. The term &quot;Wǔyì&quot; (), literally &quot;five counties&quot;, refers to the modern administrative region, but this term is not used to refer to Taishanese.

== History ==
Taishanese originates from the Taishan region, where it is spoken. Taishanese can also be seen as a group of very closely related, mutually intelligible dialects spoken in the various towns and villages in and around Siyi (the four counties of Toishan, Hoiping, Yanping, Sunwui, transcribed from Cantonese; the names &quot;Taishan, Kaiping, Enping and Xinhui&quot;, as above, are romanized from Standard Mandarin using Pinyin).

A vast number of Taishanese immigrants journeyed worldwide through the Taishan diaspora. The Taishan region was a major source of Chinese immigrants through continental Americas from the late-19th to mid-20th centuries. Taishanese was the predominant dialect spoken by the 19th-century Chinese builders of railroads in North America. Approximately 1.3 million people are estimated to have origins in Taishan. Prior to the signing of the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, which allowed new waves of Chinese immigrants, Taishanese was the dominant dialect spoken in Chinatowns across North America.

 Taishanese is still spoken in many Chinatowns throughout North America, including those of San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles, New York City, Boston, Vancouver, Toronto, Chicago, and Montreal by older generations of Chinese immigrants and their children, but is today being supplanted by mainstream Cantonese and increasingly by Mandarin in both older and newer Chinese communities alike, across the continent.

== Relationship with Cantonese ==
Taishanese is a language of the Yue branch of Chinese, which also includes Cantonese. However, due to ambiguities in the meaning of &quot;Cantonese&quot; in the English language, as it can refer to both the greater Yue dialect group or its prestige standard (Standard Cantonese), &quot;Taishanese&quot; and &quot;Cantonese&quot; are commonly used in mutually exclusive contexts, i.e. Taishanese is treated separately from &quot;Cantonese&quot;. Despite the closeness of the two, they are hardly mutually intelligible.

The phonology of Taishanese bears a lot of resemblance to Cantonese, since both of them are part of the same Yue branch. Like other Yue dialects, such as the Goulou dialects, Taishanese pronunciation and vocabulary may sometimes differ greatly from Cantonese. Although Taishan stands only from the city of Guangzhou, they are separated by numerous rivers, and the dialect of Taishan is among the most linguistically distant Yue dialects from the Guangzhou dialect.

Standard Cantonese functions as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; in Guangdong province, and speakers of other Chinese varieties (such as Chaozhou, Minnan, Hakka) living in Guangdong may also speak Cantonese. On the other hand, Standard Mandarin Chinese is the standard language of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the only legally allowed medium for teaching in schools throughout most of the country (except in minority areas), so residents of Taishan speak Mandarin as well. Although the Chinese government has been making great efforts to popularize Mandarin by administrative means, most Taishan residents do not speak Mandarin in their daily lives, but treat it as a second language, with Cantonese being the lingua franca of their region.

== Phonology ==
===Initial consonants===
There are 19 to 23 initials consonants (or onsets) in Taishanese, which is shown in the chart below in IPA:
#The respective nasal onsets (, , and ) are allophones of the pre-nasalized voiced stop onsets (, , and ). The velar nasal (ŋ) sound occurs in both syllable initial and syllable final positions. There is a tendency toward denasalization for initial as in 耳 ‘ear’, 飲/饮 ‘to drink’，魚 ‘fish’ and 月 ‘moon’. In words like 牙 ‘tooth’ and 我 ‘I; me’, denasalization does not seem to take place. In syllable final position following the rounded vowel [o], /ŋ/ is usually modified by lip-rounding. Examples are: 東 /uŋ/ ‘east’ and 紅 /huŋ/ ‘red’.
#The palatal sibilants (, , and ) are allophones of the respective alveolar sibilants (, , and ) when the first vowel of the final consonant is high ( and ).
#The palatal approximant () is an allophone of the voiced fricative sibilant initial ().
#The palatal approximant () can be a semivowel of the vowel when used as a glide.
#The labial-velar approximant () can be a semivowel of the vowel when used as a glide.

===Vowels===

There are about seven different vowels in Taishanese:
#The closed front vowel () can be a palatal approximant () as a semivowel.
#The closed back vowel () can be a labial-velar approximant () as a semivowel.
#The rounding of the schwa is variable.

===Final consonants===

The final consonant (or rime) occurs after the initial sound, which consists of a medial, a nucleus, and a coda. There are three medial (or glides) in Taishanese that occur after the initial sound: null or no medial, , or . There are five main vowels after the medial: , , , , and null or no vowel. There are nine main codas at the end of the final: null or no coda, , , , , , , , and .

== Tones ==
Taishanese is tonal. There are five contrastive lexical tones: high, mid, low, mid falling, and low falling. In at least one Taishanese dialect, the two falling tones have merged into a low falling tone. There is no tone sandhi.

Taishanese has four changed tones: mid rising, low rising, mid dipping and low dipping. These tones are called changed tones because they are the product of morphological processes (e.g. pluralization of pronouns) on four of the lexical tones. These tones have been analyzed as the addition of a high floating tone to the end of the mid, low, mid falling and low falling tones. The high endpoint of the changed tone often reaches an even higher pitch than the level high tone; this fact has led to the proposal of an expanded number of pitch levels for Taishanese tones. The changed tone can change the meaning of a word, and this distinguishes the changed tones from tone sandhi, which does not change a word&#x27;s meaning. An example of a changed tone contrast is 刷 (to brush) and 刷 (a brush).

== Writing system ==
The writing system is Chinese. Historically, the common written language of Classical Literary Chinese united and facilitated cross-dialect exchange in dynastic China, as opposed to the spoken dialects which were too different to be mutually intelligible. In the 20th century, standard written Chinese, based on Mandarin, was codified as the new written standard. As Taishanese is primarily used in speech, characters needed specifically for writing Taishanese are not standardized and may vary. Commonly seen alternatives are shown below.

The sound represented by the IPA symbol (the voiceless alveolar lateral fricative) is particularly challenging, as it has no standard romanization. The digraph &quot;lh&quot; used above to represent this sound is used in Totonac, Chickasaw and Choctaw, which are among several written representations in the languages that include the sound. The alternative &quot;hl&quot; is used in Xhosa and Zulu, while &quot;ll&quot; is used in Welsh. Other written forms occur as well.

The following chart compares the personal pronouns among Taishanese, Cantonese, and Mandarin. In Taishanese, the plural forms of the pronouns are formed by changing the tone, whereas in Cantonese and Mandarin, a plural marker (地/哋/等 dei6 and / men, respectively) is added.

<doc id="357788" wikidata="Q558635" url="?curid=357788" title="Per capita">
<text>Per capita is a Latin phrase literally meaning &quot;by heads&quot; or &quot;for each head&quot;, and idiomatically used to mean &quot;per person&quot;. The term is used in a wide variety of social sciences and statistical research contexts, including government statistics, economic indicators, and built environment studies.

It is commonly used in the field of statistics in place of saying &quot;per person&quot; (although &quot;per caput&quot; is the Latin for &quot;per head&quot;).

It is also used in wills to indicate that each of the named beneficiaries should receive, by devise or bequest, equal shares of the estate. This is in contrast to a &quot;per stirpes&quot; division, in which each branch (Latin: &quot;stirps&quot;, : &quot;stirpes&quot;) of the inheriting family inherits an equal share of the estate. This is often used with the &#x27;2-0 rule&#x27;, a statistical principle that determines which group is larger &quot;per capita&quot;. Under the 2-0 rule, a group is the largest &quot;per capita&quot; if it has both the biggest total size and size of the group of the objects in question, therefore resulting in a 2-0 score.

<text>United Baptist is name of several diverse Baptist groups of Christianity in the United States and Canada.

==History==
The name &quot;United Baptist&quot; appears to have arisen from two separate unions of Baptist groups: (1) the union of Regular Baptists and Separate Baptists in Kentucky, Virginia, and the Carolinas in the United States late in the 18th century and near the turn of the 19th century, and (2) the union of Regular Baptists and Free Baptists in the Maritime Provinces of Canada near the beginning of the 20th century. Many Baptists in the southern United States were called United Baptists, while most in the north were called Regular Baptists. Missionary Baptist bodies such as the Southern Baptist Convention, the American Baptist Association (ABA) and even some American Baptist Churches USA (ABCUSA) are descendants of the &quot;United Baptists&quot;. Churches in the ABCUSA &quot;retaining&quot; the name &quot;United Baptist&quot; are primarily in the northeast, especially Maine, and are products of the Regular/Free Baptist union. One local association of churches in the ABA maintained the &quot;United Baptist&quot; name into the mid-1990s. A number of churches in the United Baptist Convention of the Atlantic Provinces (now Convention of Atlantic Baptist Churches) continue to use the name &quot;United Baptist&quot;.

==Status==
The most prominently recognizable United Baptists are the unaffiliated local associations of churches that have remained separate and distinct from affiliation with any national or general organizations. The &quot;Churches and Church Membership in the United States 1990&quot; survey found over 54,000 members in 436 churches and 24 associations. Approximately 27 such associations exist in the United States, and fall roughly into three groups:
# United Baptist (General), some Arminian-oriented, open communion bodies that fellowship with other bodies (that are moderately Calvinistic and closed communion). The common factor is style of worship;
# United Baptist (Landmark), moderately Calvinistic closed communion bodies that once nominally cooperated with the Southern Baptist Convention;
# United Baptist (Regular), primitivistic closed communion bodies that were early in opposition to Baptist missionary and educational enterprises, but that remained aloof from the Primitive Baptists. The largest concentration of these churches is in Kentucky.

The following associations are believed to exist in 2003:
*United Baptist (General)
**Ancient Christian (IN, KY, OH)
**Bethel (MO)
**Bethlehem (WV)
**Central Missouri (MO)
**Centerpoint (OH)
**First Love (IN)
**Friendship (IN)
**Kings River (OK, AR)
**New Bethel (OH)
**Ohio Valley (OH, WV)
**Tri-State (IN, KY, OH)
**Union (AR)
*United Baptist (Landmark)
**Green River (KY)
**South Concord (KY)
**South Fork (KY) - Disbanded as of September 2013. 
**Stockton Valley (TN)
**West Union (TN)
*United Baptist (Regular)
**Blaine Union (KY)
**Calvary (WV) - called &quot;Regular United&quot;
**Cedar Springs (KY)
**Iron Hill (KY, OH, WV)
**Laurel River (KY)
**Mt. Sion (WV, KY) - called &quot;Regular United&quot;
**Mt. Zion (KY)
**New Hope (KY)
**Paint Union (KY, OH, IN)
**Old Bethlehem (WV, OH)
**Old Paint Union (KY, OH)
**Old Tri-State Zion (KY)- no longer in existence 
**Original Old Paint Union (KY) - No longer in existence
**Red Bird River (KY)
**Town Creek (AL)- &quot;United Baptists of the Primitive Faith and Order&quot;
**Tri-State Zion (KY)
**United (KY)
**Union Bethlehem (WV)-No longer in existence.
**Wills Creek (AL) - &quot;United Baptists of the Primitive Faith and Order&quot;
**Wills Creek (AL)
**Old Zion (KY, WV, OH)

Old Paint Union dissolved, with two churches going into Tri-State Zion, and the other four going into Paint Union.

Union Bethlehem dissolved after a split occurred in Tri-State Zion and Union Bethlehem. Five churches from TSZ and two from Union Bethlehem formed Zion(Tris-State Zion). Union Bethlem was left with only four churches, so they dissolved that association, and went into Paint Union.

These three sub-groups of United Baptists reflect differences in benevolences, (i.e. Sunday School) historical affiliations (i.e. Landmark) and worship styles (i.e. a cappella vs. musical instruments).

*Three bodies nominally connected to the name United Baptist:
**Convention of Atlantic Baptist Churches - a union of Free Baptists and Regular Baptists
**United American Free Will Baptist Church
**United American Free Will Baptist Conference

==Practice==
The unaffiliated United Baptist associations differ from one another in their views on the atonement, eternal security, and prerequisites of communion. They are fairly consistent in avoiding general unions and conventions, observing the ordinance of feet washing, and preferring an itinerant and non-salaried ministry, ministers may only be men and hold their own jobs for living support, the church is supported by free will offerings and give to the minister free will offerings from church service. A majority of the churches tend to primitivism, including women remaining silent during business of the church and not wearing pants (though some of the women wear pants outside the church), rejecting a seminary trained ministry, and even instrumental music, (though some have pianos). They hold the old time ways in salvation, that people must be first convicted of their sins through old time preaching and be born again through repentance. They do not believe in the practice of &quot;accepting&quot; the Lord as personal Savior, since they salvation comes from God during repentance to his satisfaction—when God is fully satisfied he will give deliverance from sin (salvation) (e.g., Green River, Kentucky Association). True United Baptist only use natural water baptisms. Associations promote fellowship by &quot;corresponding&quot; with (sending representatives to) other associations that they deem to be of &quot;like faith and order&quot;.

<doc id="357796" wikidata="Q179270" url="?curid=357796" title="Constructivism (philosophy of science)">
<text>Constructivism is a view in the philosophy of science that maintains that scientific knowledge is constructed by the scientific community, which seeks to measure and construct models of the natural world. According to constructivists, natural science consists of mental constructs that aim to explain sensory experiences and measurements, and that there is no single valid methodology in science but rather a diversity of useful methods. They also hold that the world is independent of human minds, but knowledge of the world is always a human and social construction. Constructivism opposes the philosophy of objectivism, embracing the belief that human beings can come to know the truth about the natural world not mediated by scientific approximations with different degrees of validity and accuracy. 

==Constructivism and sciences==
===Social constructivism in sociology===

One version of &quot;social constructivism&quot; contends that categories of knowledge and reality are actively created by social relationships and interactions. These interactions also alter the way in which scientific episteme is organized.

Social activity presupposes human interaction, and in the case of social construction, utilizing semiotic resources (meaning-making and signifying) with reference to social structures and institutions. Several traditions use the term &quot;Social Constructivism&quot;: psychology (after Lev Vygotsky), sociology (after Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann, themselves influenced by Alfred Schütz), sociology of knowledge (David Bloor), sociology of mathematics (Sal Restivo), philosophy of mathematics (Paul Ernest). Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s later philosophy can be seen as a foundation for &quot;social constructivism&quot;, with its key theoretical concepts of &quot;language games&quot; embedded in &quot;forms of life&quot;.

===Constructivism in philosophy of science===
Thomas Kuhn argued that changes in scientists&#x27; views of reality not only contain subjective elements but result from group dynamics, &quot;revolutions&quot; in scientific practice, and changes in &quot;paradigms&quot;. As an example, Kuhn suggested that the Sun-centric Copernican &quot;revolution&quot; replaced the Earth-centric views of Ptolemy not because of empirical failures but because of a new &quot;paradigm&quot; that exerted control over what scientists felt to be the more fruitful way to pursue their goals.
The view of reality as accessible only through models was called model-dependent realism by Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow. While not rejecting an independent reality, model-dependent realism says that we can know only an approximation of it provided by the intermediary of models.
These models evolve over time as guided by scientific inspiration and experiments.

In the field of the social sciences, constructivism as an epistemology urges that researchers reflect upon the paradigms that may be underpinning their research, and in the light of this that they become more open to considering other ways of interpreting any results of the research. Furthermore, the focus is on presenting results as negotiable constructs rather than as models that aim to &quot;represent&quot; social realities more or less accurately. Norma Romm, in her book Accountability in Social Research (2001), argues that social researchers can earn trust from participants and wider audiences insofar as they adopt this orientation and invite inputs from others regarding their inquiry practices and the results thereof.

===Constructivism and psychology===

In psychology, constructivism refers to many schools of thought that, though extraordinarily different in their techniques (applied in fields such as education and psychotherapy), are all connected by a common critique of previous standard objectivist approaches. Constructivist psychology schools share assumptions about the active constructive nature of human knowledge. In particular, the critique is aimed at the &quot;associationist&quot; postulate of empiricism, &quot;by which the mind is conceived as a passive system that gathers its contents from its environment and, through the act of knowing, produces a copy of the order of reality.&quot;

In contrast, &quot;constructivism is an epistemological premise grounded on the assertion that, in the act of knowing, it is the human mind that actively gives meaning and order to that reality to which it is responding&quot;.
The constructivist psychologies theorize about and investigate how human beings create systems for meaningfully understanding their worlds and experiences.

===Constructivism and education===
Joe L. Kincheloe has published numerous social and educational books on critical constructivism (2001, 2005, 2008), a version of constructivist epistemology that places emphasis on the exaggerated influence of political and cultural power in the construction of knowledge, consciousness, and views of reality. In the contemporary mediated electronic era, Kincheloe argues, dominant modes of power have never exerted such influence on human affairs. Coming from a critical pedagogical perspective, Kincheloe argues that understanding a critical constructivist epistemology is central to becoming an educated person and to the institution of just social change.

Kincheloe&#x27;s characteristics of critical constructivism:

*Knowledge is socially constructed: World and information co-construct one another
*Consciousness is a social construction
*Political struggles: Power plays an exaggerated role in the production of knowledge and consciousness
*The necessity of understanding consciousness—even though it does not lend itself to traditional reductionistic modes of measurability
*The importance of uniting logic and emotion in the process of knowledge and producing knowledge
*The inseparability of the knower and the known
*The centrality of the perspectives of oppressed peoples—the value of the insights of those who have suffered as the result of existing social arrangements
*The existence of multiple realities: Making sense of a world far more complex than we originally imagined
*Becoming humble knowledge workers: Understanding our location in the tangled web of reality
*Standpoint epistemology: Locating ourselves in the web of reality, we are better equipped to produce our own knowledge
*Constructing practical knowledge for critical social action
*Complexity: Overcoming reductionism
*Knowledge is always entrenched in a larger process
*The centrality of interpretation: Critical hermeneutics
*The new frontier of classroom knowledge: Personal experiences intersecting with pluriversal information
*Constructing new ways of being human: Critical ontology

==Constructivist approaches==

===Critical constructivism===
series of articles published in the journal &quot;Critical Inquiry&quot; (1991) served as a manifesto for the movement of critical constructivism in various disciplines, including the natural sciences. Not only truth and reality, but also &quot;evidence&quot;, &quot;document&quot;, &quot;experience&quot;, &quot;fact&quot;, &quot;proof&quot;, and other central categories of empirical research (in physics, biology, statistics, history, law, etc.) reveal their contingent character as a social and ideological construction. Thus, a &quot;realist&quot; or &quot;rationalist&quot; interpretation is subjected to criticism. Kincheloe&#x27;s political and pedagogical notion (above) has emerged as a central articulation of the concept.

===Cultural constructivism===
Cultural constructivism asserts that knowledge and reality are a product of their cultural context, meaning that two independent cultures will likely form different observational methodologies.

===Genetic epistemology===

James Mark Baldwin invented this expression, which was later popularized by Jean Piaget. From 1955 to 1980, Piaget was Director of the International Centre for Genetic Epistemology in Geneva.

===Radical constructivism===

Ernst von Glasersfeld was a prominent proponent of radical constructivism. This claims that knowledge is not a commodity that is transported from one mind into another. Rather, it is up to the individual to &quot;link up&quot; specific interpretations of experiences and ideas with their own reference of what is possible and viable. That is, the process of constructing knowledge, of understanding, is dependent on the individual&#x27;s subjective interpretation of their active experience, not what &quot;actually&quot; occurs. Understanding and acting are seen by radical constructivists not as dualistic processes but &quot;circularly conjoined&quot;.

Radical constructivism is closely related to second-order cybernetics.

&quot;Constructivist Foundations&quot; is a free online journal publishing peer-reviewed articles on radical constructivism by researchers from multiple domains.

===Relational constructivism===

Relational constructivism can be perceived as a relational consequence of radical constructivism. In contrary to social constructivism, it picks up the epistemological threads. It maintains the radical constructivist idea that humans cannot overcome their limited conditions of reception (i.e., &quot;self-referentially operating cognition&quot;). Therefore, humans are not able to come to objective conclusions about the world.

In spite of the subjectivity of human constructions of reality, relational constructivism focuses on the relational conditions applying to human perceptional processes. Björn Kraus puts it in a nutshell:

===Social Constructivism===
==Criticisms==
Numerous criticisms have been levelled at Constructivism. The most common one is that it either explicitly advocates or implicitly reduces to relativism.

Another criticism of constructivism is that it holds that the concepts of two different social formations be entirely different and incommensurate. This being the case, it is impossible to make comparative judgments about statements made according to each worldview. This is because the criteria of judgment will themselves have to be based on some worldview or other. If this is the case, then it brings into question how communication between them about the truth or falsity of any given statement could be established.

The Wittgensteinian philosopher Gavin Kitching argues that constructivists usually implicitly presuppose a deterministic view of language, which severely constrains the minds and use of words by members of societies: they are not just &quot;constructed&quot; by language on this view but are literally &quot;determined&quot; by it. Kitching notes the contradiction here: somehow, the advocate of constructivism is not similarly constrained. While other individuals are controlled by the dominant concepts of society, the advocate of constructivism can transcend these concepts and see through them.
