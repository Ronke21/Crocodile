<text>An identity document (abbreviated as ID) is a document proving a person&#x27;s identity.

If the identity document is a plastic card it is called an &quot;identity card&quot; (abbreviated as &quot;IC&quot; or &quot;ID card&quot;). When the identity document incorporates a photographic portrait, it is called a &quot;photo ID&quot;. In some countries, identity documents may be compulsory or non-compulsory to have.

The identity document is used to connect a person to information about the person, often in a database. The connection between the identity document and database is based on personal information present on the document, such as the bearer&#x27;s full name, birth date, address, an identification number, card number, gender, citizenship and more. A unique national identification number is the most secure way, but some countries lack such numbers or do not show them on identity documents.

In the absence of an explicit identity document, other documents such as driver&#x27;s license may be accepted in many countries for identity verification. Some countries do not accept driver&#x27;s licenses for identification, often because in those countries they do not expire as documents and can be old or easily forged. Most countries accept passports as a form of identification. Some countries require all people to have an identity document available at all times. Many countries require all foreigners to have a passport or occasionally a national identity card from their home country available at any time if they do not have a residence permit in the country.
==History==

A version of the passport considered to be the earliest identity document inscribed into law was introduced by King Henry V of England with the Safe Conducts Act 1414.

For the next 500 years up to the onset of the First World War, most people did not have or need an identity document.

Photographic identification appeared in 1876 but it did not become widely used until the early 20th century when photographs became part of passports and other ID documents, all of which came to be referred to as &quot;photo IDs&quot; in the late 20th century. Both Australia and Great Britain, for example, introduced the requirement for a photographic passport in 1915 after the so-called Lody spy scandal.

The shape and size of identity cards were standardized in 1985 by ISO/IEC 7810. Some modern identity documents are smart cards that include a difficult-to-forge embedded integrated circuit standardized in 1988 by ISO/IEC 7816. New technologies allow identity cards to contain biometric information, such as a photograph, face; hand, or iris measurements; or fingerprints. Many countries issue electronic identity cards.

==Adoption==
Law enforcement officials claim that identity cards make surveillance and the search for criminals easier and therefore support the universal adoption of identity cards. In countries that do not have a national identity card, there is concern about the projected costs and potential abuse of high-tech smartcards.

In many countries – especially English-speaking countries such as Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States – there are no government-issued compulsory identity cards for all citizens. Ireland&#x27;s Public Services Card is not considered a national identity card by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP), but many say it is in fact becoming that, and without public debate or even a legislative foundation.

There is debate in these countries about whether such cards and their centralised databases constitute an infringement of privacy and civil liberties. Most criticism is directed towards the possibility of abuse of centralised databases storing sensitive data. A 2006 survey of UK Open University students concluded that the planned compulsory identity card under the Identity Cards Act 2006 coupled with a central government database generated the most negative response among several options. None of the countries listed above mandate identity documents, but they have &quot;de facto&quot; equivalents since these countries still require proof of identity in many situations. For example, all vehicle drivers must have a driving licence, and young people may need to use specially issued &quot;proof of age cards&quot; when purchasing alcohol.

===Arguments for===
Arguments for identity documents as such:
* In order to avoid mismatching people and to fight fraud, there should be a secure way to prove a person&#x27;s identity. 
* Every human being already carries their own personal identification in the form of DNA, which is extremely hard to falsify or to discard (in terms of modification). Even for non-state commercial and private interactions, this may shortly become the preferred identifier, rendering a state-issued identity card a lesser evil than the potentially extensive privacy risks associated with everyday use of a person&#x27;s genetic profile for identification purposes.
Arguments for national identity documents:
*If using only private alternatives, such as ID cards issued by banks, the inherent lack of consistency regarding issuance policies can lead to downstream problems. For example, in Sweden private companies such as banks (citing security reasons) refused to issue ID cards to individuals without a Swedish card or Swedish passport. This forced the government to start issuing national cards. It is also harder to control information usage by private companies, such as when credit card issuers or social media companies map purchase behaviour in order to assist ad targeting.

===Arguments against===

Arguments against identity documents as such:
* The development and administrative costs of an identity card system can be high. Figures from £30 to £90 or even higher were suggested for the abandoned UK ID card. In countries such as Chile the identity card is paid for by each person up to £6; in other countries, such as France or Venezuela, the ID card is free. This, however, does not disclose the true cost of issuing ID cards as some additional portion may be borne by taxpayers in general.

Arguments against national identity documents:
* Rather than relying on government-issued ID cards, U.S. federal policy has encouraged a variety of identification systems that already exist, such as driver&#x27;s or firearms licences or private cards.
Arguments against overuse or abuse of identity documents:
* Cards reliant on a centralized database can be used to track someone&#x27;s physical movements and private life, thus infringing on personal freedom and privacy. The proposed British ID card proposes a series of linked databases managed by private sector firms. The management of disparate linked systems across a range of institutions and any number of personnel is alleged to be a security disaster in the making.
*If race is displayed on mandatory ID documents, this information can lead to racial profiling.

== National policies ==
According to Privacy International, , possession of identity cards was compulsory in about 100 countries, though what constitutes &quot;compulsory&quot; varies. In some countries, it is compulsory to have an identity card when a person reaches a prescribed age. The penalty for non-possession is usually a fine, but in some cases it may result in detention until identity is established. For people suspected with crimes such as shoplifting or fare evasion, non-possession might result in such detention, also in countries not formally requiring identity cards. In practice, random checks are rare, except in certain situations.

A handful of countries do not issue identity cards. These include Andorra, Australia, the Bahamas, Canada, Nauru, New Zealand, Samoa, Tuvalu and the United Kingdom. Other identity documents such as passports or driver&#x27;s licenses are then used as identity documents when needed. However, governments of the Bahamas and Samoa are planning to introduce new national identity cards in the near future Some countries, like Denmark, have more simple official identity cards, which do not match the security and level of acceptance of a national identity card, and which are used by people without driver&#x27;s licenses.

A number of countries have voluntary identity card schemes. These include Austria, Belize, Finland, France (see France section), Hungary (however, all citizens of Hungary must have at least one of: valid passport, photo-based driving licence, or the National ID card), Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Saint Lucia, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States. The United Kingdom&#x27;s scheme was scrapped in January 2011 and the database was destroyed.

In the United States, the Federal government issues optional non-obligatory identity cards known as &quot;Passport Cards&quot; (which include important information such as the nationality). On the other hand, states issue optional identity cards for people who do not hold a driver&#x27;s license as an alternate means of identification. These cards are issued by the same organisation responsible for driver&#x27;s licenses, usually called the Department of Motor Vehicles. Passport Cards hold limited travel status or provision, usually for domestic travel.

For the Sahrawi people of Western Sahara, pre-1975 Spanish identity cards are the main proof that they were Saharawi citizens as opposed to recent Moroccan settlers. They would thus be allowed to vote in an eventual self-determination referendum.

Companies and government departments may issue ID cards for security purposes, proof of identity, or also as proof of a qualification (without proving identity). For example, all taxicab drivers in the UK carry ID cards. Managers, supervisors, and operatives in construction in the UK can get a photographic ID card, the CSCS (Construction Skills Certification Scheme) card, indicating training and skills including safety training. The card is not an identity card or a legal requirement, but enables holders to prove competence without having to provide all the pertinent documents. Those working on UK railway lands near working lines must carry a photographic ID card to indicate training in track safety (PTS and other cards) possession of which is dependent on periodic and random alcohol and drug screening. In Queensland and Western Australia, anyone working with children has to take a background check and get issued a Blue Card or Working with Children Card, respectively.

===Africa===

==== Cape Verde ====

Cartão Nacional de Identificação (CNI) is the national identity card of Cape Verde.

====Egypt====
It is compulsory for all Egyptian citizens age 16 or older to possess an ID card ( &quot;Biṭāqat taḥqīq shakhṣiyya&quot;, literally, &quot;Personal Verification Card&quot;). In daily colloquial speech, it is generally simply called &quot;el-biṭāqa&quot; (&quot;the card&quot;). It is used for:
* Opening or closing a bank account
* Registering at a school or university
* Registering the number of a mobile or landline telephone
* Interacting with most government agencies, including:
** Applying for or renewing a driver&#x27;s license
** Applying for a passport
** Applying for any social services or grants
** Registering to vote, and voting in elections
** Registering as a taxpayer
Egyptian ID cards consist of 14 digits, the national identity number, and expire after 7 years from the date of issue. Some feel that Egyptian ID cards are problematic, due to the general poor quality of card holders&#x27; photographs and the compulsory requirements for ID card holders to identify their religion and for married women to include their husband&#x27;s name on their cards.

====Gambia====
All Gambian citizens over 18 years of age are required to hold a Gambian National Identity Card. In July 2009, a new biometric identity card was introduced. The biometric card is one of the acceptable documents required to apply for a Gambian Driving Licence.

==== Ghana ====

Ghana begun the issuing of a national identity card for Ghanaian citizens in 1973.
However, the project was discontinued three years later due to problems with logistics and lack of financial support. This was the first time the idea of national identification systems in the form of the Ghana Card arose in the country. Full implementation of the Ghana Cards begun from 2006. 
According to the National Identification Authority, over 15 million Ghanaians have been registered for the Ghana card by September 2020.

====Liberia ====
Liberia has begun the issuance process of its national biometric identification card, which citizens and foreign residents will use to open bank accounts and participate in other government services on a daily basis.

More than 4.5 million people are expected to register and obtain ID cards of citizenship or residence in Liberia. The project has already started where NIR (National Identification Registry) is issuing Citizen National ID Cards. The centralized National Biometric Identification System (NBIS) will be integrated with other government ministries. Resident ID Cards and ECOWAS ID Cards will also be issued.

====Mauritius====
Mauritius requires all citizens who have reached the age of 18 to apply for a National Identity Card. The National Identity Card is one of the few accepted forms of identification, along with passports. A National Identity Card is needed to apply for a passport for all adults, and all minors must take with them the National Identity Card of a parent(s) when applying for a passport.

==== Mozambique ====

Bilhete de identidade (BI) is the national ID card of Mozambique.

====Nigeria====
Nigeria first introduced a national identity card in 2005, but its adoption back then was limited and not widespread.
The country is now in the process of introducing a new biometric ID card complete with a SmartCard and other security features. The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) is the federal government agency responsible for the issuance of these new cards, as well as the management of the new National Identity Database.
The Federal Government of Nigeria announced in April 2013 that after the next general election in 2015, all subsequent elections will require that voters will only be eligible to stand for office or vote provided the citizen possesses a NIMC-issued identity card.
The Central Bank of Nigeria is also looking into instructing banks to request for a National Identity Number (NIN) for any citizen maintaining an account with any of the banks operating in Nigeria. The proposed kick off date is yet to be determined.

====South Africa====

South African citizens aged 15 years and 6 months or older are eligible for an ID card. The South African identity document is not valid as a travel document or valid for use outside South Africa. Although carrying the document is not required in daily life, it is necessary to show the document or a certified copy as proof of identity when:
* Signing a contract, including
** Opening or closing a bank account
** Registering at a school or university
** Buying a mobile phone and registering the number
* Interacting with most government agencies, including
** Applying for or renewing a driving licence or firearm licence
** Applying for a passport
** Applying for any social services or grants
** Registering to vote, and voting in elections
** Registering as a taxpayer or for unemployment insurance
The South African identity document used to also contain driving and firearms licences; however, these documents are now issued separately in card format.
In mid 2013 a smart card ID was launched to replace the ID book. The cards were launched on July 18, 2013, when a number of dignitaries received the first cards at a ceremony in Pretoria. The government plans to have the ID books phased out over a six to eight-year period. The South African government is looking into possibly using this smart card not just as an identification card but also for licences, National Health Insurance, and social grants.

====Tunisia====

Every citizen of Tunisia is expected to apply for an ID card by the age of 18; however, with the approval of a parent(s), a Tunisian citizen may apply for, and receive, an ID card prior to their eighteenth birthday upon parental request.

In 2016, The government has introduced a new bill to the parliament to issue new biometric ID documents. The bill has created controversy amid civil society organizations.

====Zimbabwe====
Zimbabweans are required to apply for National Registration at the age of 16. Zimbabwean citizens are issued with a plastic card which contains a photograph and their particulars onto it. Before the introduction of the plastic card, the Zimbabwean ID card used to be printed on anodised aluminium. Along with Driving Licences, the National Registration Card (including the old metal type) is universally accepted as proof of identity in Zimbabwe. Zimbabweans are required by law to carry identification on them at all times and visitors to Zimbabwe are expected to carry their passport with them at all times.

===Asia===

====Afghanistan====

Afghan citizens over the age of 18 are required to carry a national ID document called Tazkira.

====Bahrain====
Bahraini citizens must have both an ID card, called a &quot;smart card&quot;, which is recognized as an official document and can be used within the Gulf Cooperation Council, and a passport, which is recognized worldwide.

====Bangladesh====

Biometric identification has existed in Bangladesh since 2008. All Bangladeshis who are 18 years of age and older are included in a central Biometric Database, which is used by the Bangladesh Election Commission to oversee the electoral procedure in Bangladesh. All Bangladeshis are issued with an &quot;NID Card&quot; which can be used to obtain a passport, Driving Licence, credit card, and to register land ownership.

====Bhutan====
The Bhutanese national identity card (called the Buthanese Citizenship card) is an electronic ID card, compulsory for all Bhutanese nationals and costs 100 Bhutanese ngultrum.

====China====

The People&#x27;s Republic of China requires each of its citizens aged 16 and over to carry an identity card. The card is the only acceptable legal document to obtain employment, a residence permit, driving licence or passport, and to open bank accounts or apply for entry to tertiary education and technical colleges.

====Hong Kong====

The Hong Kong Identity Card (or HKID) is an official identity document issued by the Immigration Department of Hong Kong to all people who hold the right of abode, right to land or other forms of limited stay longer than 180 days in Hong Kong. According to Basic Law of Hong Kong, all permanent residents are eligible to obtain the Hong Kong Permanent Identity Card which states that the holder has the right of abode in Hong Kong. All persons aged 16 and above must carry a valid legal government identification document in public. All persons aged 16 and above must be able to produce valid legal government identification documents when requested by legal authorities; otherwise, they may be held in detention to investigate his or her identity and legal right to be in Hong Kong.

====India====
While there is no mandatory identity card in India, the Aadhaar card, a multi-purpose national identity card, carrying 16 personal details and a unique identification number, has been available to all citizens since 2009. The card contains a photograph, full name, date of birth, and a unique, randomly generated 12-digit National Identification Number. However, the card itself is rarely required as proof, the number or a copy of the card being sufficient. The card has a SCOSTA QR code embedded on the card, through which all the details on the card are accessible. In addition to Aadhaar, PAN cards, ration cards, voter cards and driving licences are also used. These may be issued by either the government of India or the government of any state and are valid throughout the nation. The Indian passport may also be used.

====Indonesia====

Residents over 17 are required to hold a KTP (Kartu Tanda Penduduk) identity card. The card will identify whether the holder is an Indonesian citizen or foreign national. In 2011, the Indonesian government started a two-year ID issuance campaign that utilizes smartcard technology and biometric duplication of fingerprint and iris recognition. This card, called the Electronic KTP (e-KTP), will replace the conventional ID card beginning in 2013. By 2013, it is estimated that approximately 172 million Indonesian nationals will have an e-KTP issued to them.

====Iran====

Every citizen of Iran has an identification document called Shenasnameh (Iranian identity booklet) in Persian (شناسنامه). This is a booklet based on the citizen&#x27;s birth certificate which features their Shenasnameh National ID number, given name, surname, their birth date, their birthplace, and the names, birth dates and National ID numbers of their legal ascendants. In other pages of the Shenasnameh, their marriage status, names of spouse(s), names of children, date of every vote cast and eventually their death would be recorded.

Every Iranian permanent resident above the age of 15 must hold a valid National Identity Card (Persian:کارت ملی) or at least obtain their unique National Number from any of the local Vital Records branches of the Iranian Ministry of Interior.

In order to apply for an NID card, the applicant must be at least 15 years old and have a photograph attached to their Birth Certificate, which is undertaken by the Vital Records branch.

Since June 21, 2008, NID cards have been compulsory for many things in Iran and Iranian missions abroad (e.g., obtaining a passport, driver&#x27;s license, any banking procedure, etc.).

====Iraq====
Every Iraqi citizen must have a National Card (البطاقة الوطنية).

====Israel====

Israeli law requires every permanent resident above the age of 16, whether a citizen or not, to carry an identification card called &quot;te&#x27;udat zehut&quot; () in Hebrew or &quot;biţāqat huwīya&quot; () in Arabic.

The card is designed in a bilingual form, printed in Hebrew and Arabic; however, the personal data is presented in Hebrew by default and may be presented in Arabic as well if the owner decides so. The card must be presented to an official on duty (e.g., a policeman) upon request, but if the resident is unable to do this, one may contact the relevant authority within five days to avoid a penalty.

Until the mid-1990s, the identification card was considered the only legally reliable document for many actions such as voting or opening a bank account. Since then, the new Israeli driver&#x27;s licenses which include photos and extra personal information are now considered equally reliable for most of these transactions. In other situations, any government-issued photo ID, such as a passport or a military ID, may suffice.

====Japan====
Japanese citizens are not required to have identification documents with them within the territory of Japan. When necessary, official documents, such as one&#x27;s Japanese driver&#x27;s license, individual number card, basic resident registration card, radio operator license, social insurance card, health insurance card or passport are generally used and accepted. On the other hand, mid- to long-term foreign residents are required to carry their Zairyū cards, while short-term visitors and tourists (those with a Temporary Visitor status sticker in their passport) are required to carry their passports.

==== Kazakhstan ====
Since 1994, Kazakhstan has issued a compulsory identity card (), with a validity of 10 years, for all its citizens over the age of 16. In order to receive an ID card, a Kazakh citizen must apply to NJSC State Corporation &quot;Government for Citizens&quot; at their permanent or temporary place of residence.

Currently, there&#x27;s no legislation in requiring persons in Kazakhstan to carry their ID cards in public. In addition, the ID card documents could be stored digitally in mobile phones due to an eGov app launched in November 2019.

====Kuwait====

The Kuwaiti identity card is issued to Kuwaiti citizens. It can be used as a travel document when visiting countries in the Gulf Cooperation Council.

====Macau====


The Macau Resident Identity Card is an official identity document issued by the Identification Department to permanent residents and non-permanent residents.

====Malaysia====

In Malaysia, the MyKad is the compulsory identity document for Malaysian citizens aged 12 and above. Introduced by the &quot;National Registration Department of Malaysia&quot; on September 5, 2001, as one of four MSC Malaysia flagship applications and a replacement for the High Quality Identity Card (&quot;Kad Pengenalan Bermutu Tinggi&quot;), Malaysia became the first country in the world to use an identification card that incorporates both photo identification and fingerprint biometric data on an in-built computer chip embedded in a piece of plastic.

====Myanmar====

Myanmar citizens are required to obtain a National Registration Card (NRC), while non-citizens are given a Foreign Registration Card (FRC).

====Nepal====

New biometric cards rolled out in 2018. Information displayed in both English and Nepali.

====Pakistan====
In Pakistan, all adult citizens must register for the Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC), with a unique number, at age 18. CNIC serves as an identification document to authenticate an individual&#x27;s identity as a citizen of Pakistan.

Earlier on, National Identity Cards (NICs) were issued to citizens of Pakistan. Now, the government has shifted all its existing records of National Identity Cards (NIC) to the central computerized database managed by NADRA. New CNIC&#x27;s are machine readable and have security features such as facial and fingerprint information. At the end of 2013, smart national identity cards, SNICs, were also made available.

====Palestine====
The Palestinian Authority issues identification cards following agreements with Israel. Since 1995, in accordance to the Oslo Accords, the data is forwarded to Israeli databases and verified. In February 2014, a presidential decision issued by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas to abolish the religion field was announced. Israel has objected to abolishing religion on Palestinian IDs because it controls their official records, IDs and passports and the PA does not have the right to make amendments to this effect without the prior approval of Israel. The Palestinian Authority in Ramallah said that abolishing religion on the ID has been at the center of negotiations with Israel since 1995. The decision was criticized by Hamas officials in Gaza Strip, saying it is unconstitutional and will not be implemented in Gaza because it undermines the Palestinian cause.

====Philippines====
A new Philippines identity card known as the Philippine Identification System (PhilSys) ID card began to be issued in August 2018 to Filipino citizens and foreign residents aged 18 and above. This national ID card is non-compulsory but should harmonize existing government-initiated identification cards that have been issued – including the Unified Multi-Purpose ID issued to members of the Social Security System, Government Service Insurance System, Philippine Health Insurance Corporation and the Home Development Mutual Fund (Pag-IBIG Fund).

====Singapore====

In Singapore, every citizen, and permanent resident (PR) must register at the age of 15 for an Identity Card (IC). The card is necessary not only for procedures of state but also in the day-to-day transactions such as registering for a mobile phone line, obtaining certain discounts at stores, and logging on to certain websites on the internet. Schools frequently use it to identify students, both online and in exams.

====South Korea====

Every citizen of South Korea over the age of 17 is issued an ID card called &quot;Jumindeungrokjeung&quot; (주민등록증). It has had several changes in its history, the most recent form being a plastic card meeting the ISO 7810 standard. The card has the holder&#x27;s photo and a 15-digit ID number calculated from the holder&#x27;s birthday and birthplace. A hologram is applied for the purpose of hampering forgery. This card has no additional features used to identify the holder, save the photo. Other than this card, the South Korean government accepts a Korean driver&#x27;s license card, an Alien Registration Card, a passport and a public officer ID card as an official ID card.

====Sri Lanka====

The E-National Identity Card (abbreviation: E-NIC) is the identity document in use in Sri Lanka. It is compulsory for all Sri Lankan citizens who are sixteen years of age and older to have a NIC. NICs are issued from the Department for Registration of Persons. The Registration of Persons Act No.32 of 1968 as amended by Act Nos 28 and 37 of 1971 and Act No.11 of 1981 legislates the issuance and usage of NICs.

Sri Lanka is in the process of developing a Smart Card based RFID NIC card which will replace the obsolete &#x27;laminated type&#x27; cards by storing the holders information on a chip that can be read by banks, offices, etc., thereby reducing the need to have documentation of these data physically by storing in the cloud.

The NIC number is used for unique personal identification, similar to the social security number in the US.

In Sri Lanka, all citizens over the age of 16 need to apply for a National Identity Card (NIC). Each NIC has a unique 10-digit number, in the format 000000000A (where 0 is a digit and A is a letter). The first two digits of the number are your year of birth (e.g.: 93xxxxxxxx for someone born in 1993). The final letter is generally a &#x27;V&#x27; or &#x27;X&#x27;. An NIC number is required to apply for a passport (over 16), driving license (over 18) and to vote (over 18). In addition, all citizens are required to carry their NIC on them at all times as proof of identity, given the security situation in the country. NICs are not issued to non-citizens, who are still required to carry a form of photo identification (such as a photocopy of their passport or foreign driving license) at all times. At times the Postal ID card may also be used.

====Taiwan====

The &quot;National Identification Card&quot; () is issued to all nationals of the Republic of China (Official name of Taiwan) aged 14 and older who have household registration in the Taiwan area. The Identification Card is used for virtually all activities that require identity verification within Taiwan such as opening bank accounts, renting apartments, employment applications and voting.

The Identification Card contains the holder&#x27;s photo, ID number, Chinese name, and (Minguo calendar) date of birth. The back of the card also contains the person&#x27;s registered address where official correspondence is sent, place of birth, and the name of legal ascendants and spouse (if any).

If residents move, they must re-register at a municipal office ().

ROC nationals with household registration in Taiwan are known as &quot;registered nationals&quot;. ROC nationals who do not have household registration in Taiwan (known as &quot;unregistered nationals&quot;) do not qualify for the Identification Card and its associated privileges (e.g., the right to vote and the right of abode in Taiwan), but qualify for the Republic of China passport, which unlike the Identification Card, is not indicative of residency rights in Taiwan. If such &quot;unregistered nationals&quot; are residents of Taiwan, they will hold a Taiwan Area Resident Certificate as an identity document, which is nearly identical to the Alien Resident Certificate issued to foreign nationals/citizens residing in Taiwan.

====Thailand====

In Thailand, the Thai National ID Card (Thai: บัตรประจำตัวประชาชน; RTGS: bat pracham tua pracha chon) is an official identity document issued only to Thai Nationals. The card proves the holder&#x27;s identity for receiving government services and other entitlements.

====United Arab Emirates====
The Federal Authority For Identity and Citizenship is a government agency that is responsible for issuing the National Identity Cards for the citizens (UAE nationals), GCC (Gulf Corporation Council) nationals and residents in the country. All individuals are mandated to apply for the ID card at all ages. For individuals of 15 years and above, fingerprint biometrics (10 fingerprints, palm, and writer) are captured in the registration process. Each person has a unique 15-digit identification number (IDN) that a person holds throughout his/her life.

The Identity Card is a smart card that has a state-of-art technology in the smart cards field with very high security features which make it difficult to duplicate. It is a 144KB Combi Smart Card, where the electronic chip includes personal information, 2 fingerprints, 4-digit pin code, digital signature, and certificates (digital and encryption). Personal photo, IDN, name, date of birth, signature, nationality, and the ID card expiry date are fields visible on the physical card.

In the UAE it is used as an official identification document for all individuals to benefit from services in the government, some of the non-government, and private entities in the UAE. This supports the UAE&#x27;s vision of smart government as the ID card is used to securely access e-services in the country. The ID card could also be used by citizens as an official travel document between GCC countries instead of using passports. The implementation of the national ID program in the UAE enhanced security of the individuals by protecting their identities and preventing identity theft.

====Vietnam====

In Vietnam, all citizens above 14 years old must possess a &quot;Identification card&quot; provided by the local authority, and must be reissued when the citizens&#x27; years of age reach 25, 40 and 60. Children from 6 to under 14 years old can request if needed. Formerly a &quot;people&#x27;s ID document&quot; was used.

===Europe===

====European Union, European Economic Area and European Free Trade Association====
National identity cards issued to the citizens of the European Union and European Free Trade Association (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland) that state the bearer&#x27;s citizenship as belonging to an EU/EFTA member can be used as identity documents within the home country, and as travel documents to exercise the right of free movement in the EU or EFTA.

During the UK Presidency of the EU in 2005 a decision was made to: &quot;Agree common standards for security features and secure issuing procedures for ID cards (December 2005), with detailed standards agreed as soon as possible thereafter. In this respect, the UK Presidency put forward a proposal for the EU-wide use of biometrics in national identity cards&quot;.

From August 2, 2021, the European identity card is intended to replace and standardize the various identity card styles currently in use.

=====Austria=====

The Austrian identity card is issued to Austrian citizens. It can be used as a travel document when visiting countries in the EU/EFTA, Albania, Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, North Macedonia, San Marino, Serbia, Vatican City, the French overseas territories and the British Crown Possessions, as well as on organized tours to Jordan (through Aqaba airport) and Tunisia. Only around 10% of the citizens of Austria had this card in 2012, as they can use the Austrian driver&#x27;s licenses or other identity cards domestically and the more widely accepted Austrian passport abroad.

=====Belgium=====

In Belgium, everyone above the age of 12 is issued an identity card ( in French, in Dutch and in German), and from the age of 15 carrying this card at all times is mandatory. For foreigners residing in Belgium, similar cards (foreigner&#x27;s cards, in Dutch, in French) are issued, although they may also carry a passport, a work permit, or a (temporary) residence permit.

Since 2000, all newly issued Belgian identity cards have a chip (eID card), and roll-out of these cards is expected to be complete in the course of 2009. Since 2008, the aforementioned foreigner&#x27;s card has also been replaced by an eID card, containing a similar chip. The eID cards can be used both in the public and private sector for identification and for the creation of legally binding electronic signatures.

Until end 2010 Belgian consulates issued old style ID cards (105 x 75 mm) to Belgian citizens who were permanently residing in their jurisdiction and who chose to be registered at the consulate (which is strongly advised).
Since 2011 Belgian consulates issue electronic ID cards, the electronic chip on which is not activated however.

=====Bulgaria=====

In Bulgaria, it is obligatory to possess an identity card (Bulgarian – лична карта, lichna karta) at the age of 14 and above. Any person above 14 being checked by the police without carrying at least some form of identification is liable to a fine of 50 Bulgarian levs (about €25).

=====Croatia=====

All Croatian citizens may request an Identity Card, called Osobna iskaznica (literally Personal card). All persons over the age of 18 must have an Identity Card and carry it at all times. Refusal to carry or produce an Identity Card to a police officer can lead to a fine of 100 kuna or more and detention until the individual&#x27;s identity can be verified by fingerprints.

The Croatian ID card is valid in the entire European Union, and can also be used to travel throughout the non-EU countries of the Balkans.

The 2013 design of the Croatian ID card is prepared for future installation of an electronic identity card chip, which is set for implementation in 2014.

=====Cyprus=====
The acquisition and possession of a Civil Identity Card is compulsory for any eligible person who has reached twelve years of age. On January 29, 2015, it was announced that all future IDs to be issued will be biometric. They can be applied for at Citizen Service Centres (KEP) or at consulates with biometric data capturing facilities.

An ID card costs €30 for adults and €20 for children with 10/5 years validity respectively. It is a valid travel document for the entire European Union.

=====Czech Republic=====

In Czech, an ID is called &quot;Občanský průkaz&quot;, an identity card with a photo is issued to all citizens of the Czech Republic at the age of 15. It is officially recognised by all member states of the European Union for intra EU travel. Travelling outside the EU mostly requires the Czech passport.

=====Denmark=====
Denmark is the only EU/EEA country that does not issue EU standard national identity cards or travel documents in a card format.

The most common identity documents in Denmark are driving licences and passports, containing both the personal identification number and a photo. Identity documents are not mandatory in Denmark. 

For those who do not have a passport or driving licence, Danish identification cards () are issued by municipalities. Each municipality has their own design and they are not accepted as valid travel documents outside Denmark. They were launched in 2017, replacing previous &#x27;Youth Cards&#x27;. Since 2018, information about the nationality of the cardholder has been included which briefly allowed the card to be used for travel to Sweden. However in September 2019, Swedish authorities explicitly banned Danish municipal identity cards from being used for entry for security reasons. In 2021, the Danish Ministry of Interior came to the conclusion that more secure ID cards were not on the agenda due to prohibitive costs.

Previously, P&quot;ersonal identification number certificates&quot; (Danish:&quot;Personnummerbevis)&quot; were optionally issued in Denmark but have been largely replaced by &quot;National Health Insurance Card&quot; (Danish:&quot;Sundhedskortet&quot;) which contains the same information and health insurance information. The National Health Insurance Card is issued to all health insured residents in Denmark. It was commonly used as a &quot;de facto&quot; identity document despite the fact it has no photo of the holder. Until 2004, the national debit card Dankort contained a photo of the holder and was widely accepted as identification until Danish banks lobbied successfully to have pictures removed from debit cards. Between 2004 and 2016, municipalities issued a &quot;photo identity card&quot; or &quot;youth cards&quot; (), but it was limited to proof of age verification.

=====Estonia=====
The Estonian identity card () is a chipped picture ID in the Republic of Estonia. An Estonian identity card is officially recognised by all member states of the European Union for intra EU travel. For travelling outside the EU, Estonian citizens may also require a passport.

The card&#x27;s chip stores a key pair, allowing users to cryptographically sign digital documents based on principles of public key cryptography using DigiDoc. Under Estonian law, since December 15, 2000 the cryptographic signature is legally equivalent to a manual signature.

The Estonian identity card is also used for authentication in Estonia&#x27;s ambitious Internet-based voting programme. In February 2007, Estonia was the first country in the world to institute electronic voting for parliamentary elections. Over 30 000 voters participated in the country&#x27;s first e-election. By 2014, at the European Parliament elections, the number of e-voters has increased to more than 100,000 comprising 31% of the total votes cast.

=====Finland=====
In Finland, any citizen can get an identification card (&quot;henkilökortti&quot;/&quot;identitetskort&quot;). This, along with the passport, is one of two official identity documents. It is available as an electronic ID card (&quot;sähköinen henkilökortti&quot;/&quot;elektroniskt identitetskort&quot;), which enables logging into certain government services on the Internet.

Driving licenses and KELA (social security) cards with a photo are also widely used for general identification purposes even though they are not officially recognized as such. However, KELA has ended the practice of issuing social security cards with the photograph of the bearer, while it has become possible to embed the social security information onto the national ID card. For most purposes when identification is required, only valid documents are ID card, passport or driving license. However, a citizen is not required to carry any of these.

=====France=====

France has had a national ID card for all citizens since the beginning of World War II in 1940. Compulsory identity documents were created before, for workers from 1803 to 1890, nomads (&quot;gens du voyage&quot;) in 1912, and foreigners in 1917 during World War I. National identity cards were first issued as the &quot;carte d&#x27;identité française&quot; under the law of October 27, 1940, and were compulsory for everyone over the age of 16. Identity cards were valid for 10 years, had to be updated within a year in case of change of residence, and their renewal required paying a fee. Under the Vichy regime, in addition to the face photograph, the family name, first names, date and place of birth, the card included the national identity number managed by the national statistics INSEE, which is also used as the national service registration number, as the Social Security account number for health and retirement benefits, for access to court files and for tax purposes. Under the decree 55-1397 of October 22, 1955 a revised non-compulsory card, the &quot;carte nationale d&#x27;identité&quot; (CNI) was introduced.

The law (Art. 78–1 to 78–6 of the French code of criminal procedure () mentions only that during an ID check performed by police, gendarmerie or customs officer, one can prove his identity &quot;by any means&quot;, the validity of which is left to the judgment of the law enforcement official. Though not stated explicitly in the law, an ID card, a driving licence, a passport, a visa, a &quot;Carte de Séjour&quot;, a voting card are sufficient according to jurisprudence. The decision to accept other documents, with or without the bearer&#x27;s photograph, like a Social Security card, a travel card or a bank card, is left to the discretion of the law enforcement officer.

According to Art. 78-2 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure, ID checks are only possible:
* alineas 1 &amp; 2: if you are the object of inquiries or investigations, have committed, prepared or attempted to commit an offence or if you are able to give information about it (&quot;contrôle judiciaire&quot;);
* alinea 4: within 20 km of French borders and in ports, airports and railway stations open to international traffic (&quot;contrôle aux frontières&quot;);
* alinea 3: whatever the person&#x27;s behaviour, to prevent a breach of public order and in particular an offence against the safety of persons or property (&quot;contrôle administratif&quot;).
The last case allows checks of passers-by ID by the police, especially in neighborhoods with a higher criminality rate which are often the poorest at the condition, according to the &quot;Cour de cassation&quot;, that the policeman does not refer only to &quot;general and abstract conditions&quot; but to &quot;particular circumstances able to characterise a risk of breach of public order and in particular an offence against the safety of persons or property&quot; (Cass. crim. December 5, 1999, n°99-81153, Bull., n°95).

In case of necessity to establish your identity, not being able to prove it &quot;by any means&quot; (for example the legality of a road traffic &quot;procès-verbal&quot; depends on it), may lead to a temporary arrest (&quot;vérification d&#x27;identité&quot;) of up to 4 hours for the time strictly required for ascertaining your identity according to art. 78-3 of the French Code of criminal procedure (&quot;Code de procédure pénale&quot;).

For financial transactions, ID cards and passports are almost always accepted as proof of identity. Due to possible forgery, driver&#x27;s licenses are sometimes refused. For transactions by cheque involving a larger sum, two different ID documents are frequently requested by merchants.

The current identification cards are now issued free of charge and optional, and are valid for ten years for minors, and fifteen for adults. The current government has proposed a compulsory biometric card system, which has been opposed by human rights groups and by the national authority and regulator on computing systems and databases, the &quot;Commission nationale de l&#x27;informatique et des libertés&quot;, CNIL. Another non-compulsory project is being discussed.

=====Germany=====
It is compulsory for all German citizens aged 16 or older to possess either a &quot;Personalausweis&quot; (identity card) or a passport but not to carry one. Police officers and other officials have a right to demand to see one of those documents (obligation of identification); however, the law does not state that one is obliged to submit the document at that very moment. But as driver&#x27;s licences, although sometimes accepted, are not legally accepted forms of identification in Germany, people usually choose to carry their &quot;Personalausweis&quot; with them. 

Beginning from November 2010, German ID cards are issued in the ID-1 format and contain an integrated digital signature. The cards have a photograph and a chip with biometric data, including two now mandatory fingerprints. Until October 2010, German ID cards were issued in ISO/IEC 7810 ID-2 format. On November 1, 2019, German ID cards underwent minor textual adjustments concerning the information field on the surname and surname at birth. On August 2, 2021, German ID cards were adapted to Regulation (EU) 2019/1157. The changes include the country code &quot;DE&quot; being shown in white in the blue European flag on the front and two fingerprints (as an encrypted image file) becoming mandatory. In addition, the version number was added to the machine-readable zone. On May 2, 2024, the doctor&#x27;s title was moved to the back side of the identity card.

=====Greece=====


A compulsory, universal ID system based on personal ID cards has been in place in Greece since World War II. ID cards are issued by the police on behalf of the ministry responsible for the Headquarters of the Hellenic Police (Ministry of Public Order or Ministry of Citizen Protection or Ministry of the Interior at times) and display the holder&#x27;s signature, standardized face photograph, name and surname, legal ascendants name and surname, date and place of birth, height, municipality, and the issuing police precinct. There are also two optional fields designed to facilitate emergency medical care: ABO and Rhesus factor blood typing.

Fields included in previous ID card formats, such as vocation or profession, religious denomination, domiciliary address, name and surname of spouse, fingerprint, eye and hair color, citizenship and ethnicity were removed permanently as being intrusive of personal data and/or superfluous for the sole purpose of personal identification.

Since 2000, name fields have been filled in both Greek and Latin characters. According to the Signpost Service of the European Commission [reply to Enquiry 36581], old type Greek ID cards &quot;are as valid as the new type according to Greek law and thus they constitute valid travel documents that all other EU Member States are obliged to accept&quot;. In addition to being equivalent to passports within the EU and EFTA, Greek ID cards are the principal means of identification of voters during elections.

Since 2005, the procedure to issue an ID card has been automated and now all citizens over 12 years of age must have an ID card, which is issued within one work day. Prior to that date, the age of compulsory issue was at 14 and the whole procedure could last several months.

In Greece, an ID card is a citizen&#x27;s most important state document. For instance, it is required to perform banking transactions if the teller personnel is unfamiliar with the apparent account holder, to interact with the Citizen Service Bureaus (KEP), receive parcels or registered mail etc. Citizens are also required to produce their ID card at the request of law enforcement personnel.

All the above functions can be fulfilled also with a valid Greek passport (e.g., for people who have lost their ID card and have not yet applied for a new one, people who happen to carry their passport instead of their ID card or Greeks who reside abroad and do not have an identity card, which can be issued only in Greece in contrast to passports also issued by consular authorities abroad).

=====Hungary=====
Currently, there are three types of valid ID documents (&quot;Személyazonosító igazolvány&quot;, née &quot;Személyi igazolvány&quot;, abbr. &quot;Sz.ig.&quot;) in Hungary: the oldest valid ones are hard-covered, multi-page booklets and issued before 1989 by the People&#x27;s Republic of Hungary, the second type is a soft-cover, multi-page booklet issued after the change of regime; these two have one, original photo of the owner embedded, with original signatures of the owner and the local police&#x27;s representative. The third type is a plastic card with the photo and the signature of the holder digitally reproduced. These are generally called Personal Identity Card.

The plastic card shows the owners full name, maiden name if applicable, birth date and place, mother&#x27;s maiden name, the cardholder&#x27;s gender, the ID&#x27;s validity period and the local state authority which issued the card. The card has a 6 digit number + 2 letter unique ID and a separate machine readable zone on the back for identity document scanning devices. It does not have any information about the owner&#x27;s residential address, nor their personal identity number – this sensitive information is contained on a separate card, called a Residency Card (&quot;Lakcímkártya&quot;). Personal identity numbers have been issued since 1975; they have the following format in numbers: gender (1 number) – birth date (6 numbers) – unique ID (4 numbers). They are no longer used as a personal identification number, but as a statistical signature.

Other valid documents are the passport (blue colored or red colored with RFID chip) and the driver&#x27;s license; an individual is required to have at least one of them on hand all the time. The Personal Identity Card is mandatory to vote in state elections or open a bank account in the country.

ID cards are issued to permanent residents of Hungary; the card has a different color for foreign citizens.

===== Iceland =====
Icelandic state-issued identity cards are called &quot;Nafnskírteini&quot; (). The ID cards are voluntary, conforming to biometric ICAO and EU standards and can be used as a travel document in the EU/EFTA and the Nordic countries. Identity documents are not mandatory to carry or own by law (unless driving a car), but can be needed for bank services, age verification and other situations. Most people (91%) have driving licences for day-to-day use.

=====Ireland=====
Ireland does not issue mandatory national identity cards as such. Except for a brief period during the Second World War when the Irish Department of External Affairs issued identity cards to those wishing to travel to the United Kingdom, Ireland has never issued national identity cards as such.

Identity documentation is optional for Irish and British citizens. Nevertheless, identification is mandatory to obtain certain services such as air travel, banking, interactions regarding welfare and public services, age verification, and additional situations.

&quot;Non-nationals&quot; aged 16 years and over must produce identification on demand to any immigration officer or a member of the Garda Síochána (police).

Passport booklets, passport cards, driving licences, GNIB Registration Certificates and other forms of identity cards can be used for identification. Ireland has issued optional passport cards since October 2015. The cards are the size of a credit card and have all the information from the biographical page of an Irish passport booklet and can be used explicitly for travel in the EU and EFTA.

Ireland issues a &quot;Public Services Card&quot; which is useful when identification is needed for contacts regarding welfare and public services. They have photographs but not birth dates and are therefore not accepted by banks. The card is also not considered as being an identity card by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP). In an Oireachtas (parliament) committee hearing held on February 22, 2018, Tim Duggan of that department stated &quot;A national ID card is an entirely different idea. People are generally compelled to carry (such a card).&quot;

=====Italy=====

Anyone who is legally resident in Italy, whether a citizen or not, is entitled to request an identity card at the local municipality. However, only Italian citizens can use it as a travel document in lieu of a passport, and get it on a consulate/embassy.

It is valid in all Europe (except in Belarus, Russia, Ukraine and the UK) and to travel to Turkey, Georgia, Egypt and Tunisia.

The Italian citizen is not legally required to carry an identification document, as they have the right to identify themselves verbally. However, if they are asked to present it by law enforcement and have it with them at that moment, they must show it to avoid committing an offense. If public-security officers are not convinced of the claimed identity, such as may be the case for a verbally provided identity claim, they may keep the claimant in custody until his/her identity is ascertained; such an arrest is limited to the time necessary for identification and has no legal consequence.

Instead, all foreigners in Italy are required by law to have an ID with them at all times. Citizens of EU member countries must be always ready to display an identity document that is legally government-issued in their country. Non-EU residents must have their passport with customs entrance stamp or a residence permit issued by Italian authorities; while all resident/immigrant aliens must have a residence permit (they are otherwise illegal and face deportation), foreigners from certain non-EU countries staying in Italy for a limited amount of time (typically for tourism) may be only required to have their passport with a proper customs stamp.

The current Italian identity document is a contactless electronic card made of polycarbonate in the ID-1 format with many security features and containing the following items printed by laser engraving:

# On the front: photo, card number, municipality, name, surname, place and date of birth, sex, height, nationality, date of issue, date of expiry, signature, Card Access Number, (optional) the sentence &quot;non valida per l&#x27;espatrio&quot; only if the document is not valid abroad
# On the back: surname and name of parents or legal guardian (if the applicant is not an adult yet), Italian fiscal code, Italian birth code, residence address, (optional) additional information if the owner is residing abroad, Italian fiscal code in form of barcode, Machine Readable Zone

Moreover, the embedded electronic microprocessor chip stores the holder&#x27;s picture, name, surname, place and date of birth, residency and (only if aged 12 and more) two fingerprints.

The card is integrated into the Italian SSO infrastructure, the SPID and permits the holder to use the NFC chip of the card as a login for that service.

The card is issued by the Ministry of the Interior in collaboration with the IPZS in Rome and sent to the applicant within 6 business days.

The validity is 10 years for adults, 5 years for minors aged 3–18, 3 years for children aged 0–3 and it is extended or shortened in order to expire always on birthday.

However, the old classic Italian ID card is still valid and in the process of being replaced with the new eID card since 4 July 2016, because the lack of a Machine Readable Zone, the odd size, the fact that is made of paper and so easy to forge, often cause delays at border controls and, furthermore, foreign countries outside the EU sometimes refuse to accept it as a valid document. These common criticisms were considered in the development of the new Italian electronic identity card, which is in the more common credit-card format and now has many of the latest security features available nowadays.

=====Latvia=====
The Latvian &quot;Personal certificate&quot; is issued to Latvian citizens and is valid for travel within Europe (except Belarus, Russia, Ukraine and UK), Georgia, French Overseas territories and Montserrat (max. 14 days).

===== Liechtenstein =====

The Principality of Liechtenstein has a voluntary ID card system for citizens, the Identitätskarte. Liechtenstein citizens are entitled to use a valid national identity card to exercise their right of free movement in the EU and EFTA

===== Lithuania =====
Lithuanian Personal Identity Card can be used as primary evidence of Lithuanian citizenship, just like a passport and can also be used as proof of identity both inside and outside Lithuania. It is valid for travel within most European nations.

===== Luxembourg =====
The Luxembourgish identity card is issued to Luxembourgish citizens. It serves as proof of identity and nationality and can also be used for travel within the European Union and a number of other European countries.

===== Malta =====
Maltese identity cards are issued to Maltese citizens and other lawful residents of Malta. They can be used as a travel document when visiting countries in the European Union and the European Free Trade Association. 

=====Netherlands=====
Dutch citizens from the age of 14 are required to be able to show a valid identity document upon request by a police officer or similar official. Furthermore, identity documents are required when opening bank accounts and upon start of work for a new employer. Official identity documents for residents in the Netherlands are:
* Dutch passport
* Dutch identity card
* Alien&#x27;s Residence permit
* &quot;Geprivilegieerdenkaart&quot; (amongst others for the corps diplomatique and their family members)
* Passports/national ID cards of members of other EU and EFTA countries

For the purpose of identification in public (but not for other purposes), also a Dutch driving license often may serve as an identity document.
In the Caribbean Netherlands, Dutch and other EU/EFTA identity cards are not valid; and the Identity card BES is an obligatory document for all residents.

===== Norway =====

In Norway there is no law penalising non-possession of an identity document. But there are rules requiring it for services like banking, air travel and voting (where personal recognition or other identification methods have not been possible).

The following documents are generally considered valid (varying a little, since no law lists them): Nordic driving licence, passport (often only from EU and EFTA), national ID card from EU, Norwegian ID card from banks and some more. Bank ID cards are printed on the reverse of Norwegian debit cards. To get a bank ID card either a Nordic passport or another passport together with Norwegian residence and work permit is needed.

The Norwegian identity card was introduced on November 30, 2020. Two versions of the card exist, one that states Norwegian citizenship and is usable for exercising freedom of movement within the EU and EFTA and the other for general identification. The plan started in 2007 and was delayed several times. Banks were campaigning to be freed from the task of issuing ID cards, stating that it was supposed to be the responsibility of state authorities. Some banks ceased issuing ID cards, so people had to carry their passport for credit card purchases or buying prescribed medication if not in possession of a driving licence.

Foreign citizens resident in Norway are not allowed to get the Norwegian identity card. When banks stopped issuing the cards and it was suggested that citizens get a national identity card, foreign citizens who did not have a driving licence or a homeland passport were left outside of the system. Therefore, as of 2022 there are plans to issue a version of the Norwegian identity card for foreign citizens.

As of 2020, a digital ID document was introduced in Norway. It requires a phone app and is useful for age checks, pick up of postal packages as well as other tasks. To activate it, a passport or national ID-card is needed. Many young people targeted for alcohol age checks or without a driver&#x27;s license tend to use it, but also some older citizens.

=====Poland=====
Every Polish citizen 18 years of age or older residing permanently in Poland must have an Identity Card (&quot;dokument tożsamości&quot;) issued by the local Office of Civic Affairs. Polish citizens living permanently abroad are entitled, but not required, to have one.

=====Portugal=====

All Portuguese citizens are required by law to obtain an Identity Card when they turn 6 years of age. They are not required to carry it at all times but are obliged to present it to the authorities if requested.

The old format of the cards (yellow laminated paper document) featured a portrait of the bearer, their fingerprint, and the names of parent(s), among other information.

They are currently being replaced by grey plastic cards with a chip, called &quot;Cartão de Cidadão&quot; (Citizen&#x27;s Card), which now incorporate NIF (Tax Number), Cartão de Utente (Health Card) and Social Security, all of which are protected by a PIN obtained when the card is issued.

The new Citizen&#x27;s Card is technologically more advanced than the former Identity Card and has the following characteristics:
* From the physical point of view the Citizen&#x27;s Card will have a &#x27;smart card&#x27; format and will replace the existing Identity Card, taxpayer card, Social Security card, voter&#x27;s card and National Health Service user&#x27;s card.
* From the visual point of view the front of the card will display the holder&#x27;s photograph and basic personal details. The back will list the numbers under which the holder is registered with the different bodies whose cards the Citizen&#x27;s Card combines and replaces. The back will also contain an optical reader and the chip.
* From the electronic point of view the card will have a contact chip, with digital certificates (for electronic authentication and signature purposes). The chip may also hold the same information as the physical card itself, together with other data such as the holder&#x27;s address.

=====Romania=====
Every citizen of Romania must register for an ID card (Carte de identitate, abbreviated CI) at the age of 14. The CI offers proof of the identity, address, sex and other data of the possessor. It has to be renewed every 10 years. It can be used instead of a passport for travel inside the European Union and several other countries outside the EU.

Another ID card is the Provisional ID Card (Cartea de Identitate Provizorie) issued temporarily when an individual cannot get a normal ID card. Its validity extends for up to 1 year. It cannot be used in order to travel within the EU, unlike the normal ID card.

Other forms of officially accepted identification include the driver&#x27;s license and the birth certificate. However, these are accepted only in limited circumstances and cannot take the place of the ID card in most cases. The ID card is mandatory for dealing with government institutions, banks or currency exchange shops. A valid passport may also be accepted, but usually only for foreigners.

In addition, citizens can be expected to provide the personal identification number (CNP) in many circumstances; purposes range from simple unique identification and internal book-keeping (for example when drawing up the papers for the warranty of purchased goods) to being asked for identification by the police. The CNP is 13 characters long, with the format S-YY-MM-DD-RR-XXX-Y. Where S is the sex, YY is year of birth, MM is month of birth, DD is day of birth, RR is a regional id, XXX is a unique random number and Y is a control digit.

Presenting the ID card is preferred but not mandatory when asked by police officers; however, in such cases people are expected to provide a CNP or alternate means of identification which can be checked on the spot (via radio if needed).

The information on the ID card is required to be kept updated by the owner, current address of domicile in particular. Doing otherwise can expose the citizen to certain fines or be denied service by those institutions that require a valid, up to date card. In spite of this, it is common for people to let the information lapse or go around with expired ID cards.

=====Slovakia=====
The Slovak ID card (Slovak: &quot;Občiansky preukaz&quot;) is a picture ID in Slovakia. It is issued to citizens of the Slovak Republic who are 15 or older. A Slovak ID card is officially recognised by all member states of the EU/EFTA for travel. For travel outside the EU, Slovak citizens may also require the Slovak passport, which is a legally accepted form of picture ID as well. Police officers and some other officials have a right to demand to see one of those documents, and the law states that one is obliged to submit such a document at that very moment. If one fails to comply, law enforcement officers are allowed to insist on personal identification at the police station.

=====Slovenia=====
Every Slovenian citizen regardless of age has the right to acquire an identity card (), and every citizen of the Republic of Slovenia of 18 years of age or older is obliged by law to acquire one and carry it at all times (or any other identity document with a picture, e.g., the Slovene passport or a driver&#x27;s license). The card is a valid identity document within all member states of the European Union for travel within the EU. With the exception of the Faroe Islands and Greenland, it may be used to travel outside of the EU to Norway, Liechtenstein, BiH, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Switzerland. The front side displays the name and surname, sex, nationality, date of birth, and expiration date of the card, as well as the number of the ID card, a black and white photograph, and a signature. The back contains the permanent address, administrative unit, date of issue, EMŠO, and a code with key information in a machine-readable zone. Depending on the holder&#x27;s age, the card is valid for 5 years or 10 years or permanently, and it is valid 1 year for foreigners living in Slovenia, in case of repeated loss, and in some other circumstances. Since 28 March 2022, it is possible but not mandatory to acquire a biometric ID card. An identity document in healthcare institutions is the healthcare insurance card. Since April 2023, a biometric ID card may be used instead.

=====Spain=====


In Spain, citizens, resident foreigners, and companies have similar but distinct identity numbers, some with prefix letters, all with a check-code:
* NIF Both natural and legal persons have a tax code or &quot;Número de Identificación Fiscal&quot; (NIF), which is the same as their identity document. For companies this was formerly known as &quot;Código de Identificación Fiscal&quot; (CIF)
* DNI Spanish citizens have a &quot;Documento Nacional de Identidad&quot; (DNI), which bears this number without any letter prefix. This is sometimes known by obsolete names such as &quot;Cédula de Ciudadanía&quot; (CC),&quot;Carné de Identidad&quot; (CI) or &quot;Cédula de Identidad&quot; (CI).
:Spanish citizens under 14 may, but over 14 must, acquire a National Identity Card &quot;(DNI)&quot;. It is issued by the National Police formerly ID-1 (bankcard) format paper encapsulated in plastic. Since 2006 a new version of the &#x27;DNI&#x27; has been introduced. The new &#x27;Electronic DNI&#x27; is a Smart card that allows for digital signing of documents. The chip contains most of the personal information printed on the card and a digitized version of the bearer&#x27;s face, signature and fingerprints.

:On the front there is a photograph, the name and surname (see Spanish naming customs), the bearer&#x27;s signature, an id number, the issue date and the expiry date. On the reverse appears the date and place of birth, the gender, legal ascendants name and the current address. At the bottom there is key information in a machine-readable zone. Depending on holder&#x27;s age, the card has a validity of 5 years, 10 years or indefinite (for the elderly).
* CIF &quot;Código de Identidad Fiscal&quot; has been retained only for associations and foundations that have a CIF which starts with the letter G.
* NIE Foreigners ( eXtranjeros in Spanish) are issued with a Número de Identificación de Extranjero, which starts with the letter X or Y. NIE cards for EU citizens have been abolished and replaced by a printed A4 page, which does not need to be carried, whilst cards are still issued to non-EU citizens, now following the standard European format.

Despite the NIF/CIF/NIE/NIF distinctions the &quot;identity number&quot; is unique and always has eight digits (the NIE has 7 digits) followed by a letter calculated from a 23-Modular arithmetic check used to verify the correctness of the number. The letters I, Ñ, O and U are not used and the 
sequence is as follows:

This number is the same for tax, social security and all legal purposes. Without this number (or a foreign equivalent such as a passport number), a contract may not be enforceable.

In Spain the formal identity number on an ID card is the most important piece of identification. It is used in all public and private transactions. It is required to open a bank account, to sign a contract, to have state insurance and to register at a university and should be shown when being fined by a police officer. It is one of the official documents required to vote at any election, although any other form of official ID such as a driving licence or passport may be used. The card also constitutes a valid travel document within the European Union.

Non-resident citizens of countries such as the United Kingdom, where passport numbers are not fixed for the holder&#x27;s life but change with renewal, may experience difficulty with legal transactions after the document is renewed since the old number is no longer verifiable on a valid (foreign) passport. However, a NIE is issued for life and does not change and can be used for the same purposes.

=====Sweden=====
Sweden does not have a legal statute for compulsory identity documents. However, ID cards are regularly used to ascertain a person&#x27;s identity when completing certain transactions. These include but are not limited to banking and age verification. Also, interactions with public authorities often require it, in spite of the fact that there is no law explicitly requiring it, because there are laws requiring authorities to somehow verify people&#x27;s identity. Without Swedish identity documents difficulties can occur accessing health care services, receiving prescription medications and getting salaries or grants. From 2008, EU passports have been accepted for these services due to EU legislation (with exceptions including banking), but non-EU passports are not accepted. Identity cards have therefore become an important part of everyday life.

There are currently three public authorities that issue ID cards: the Swedish Tax Agency, the Swedish Police Authority, and the Swedish Transport Agency.

The Tax Agency cards can only be used within Sweden to validate a person&#x27;s identity, but they can be obtained both by Swedish citizens and those that currently reside in Sweden. A Swedish personal identity number is required. It is possible to get one without having any Swedish ID card. In this case a person holding such a card must guarantee the identity, and the person must be a verifiable relative or the boss at the company the person has been working or a few other verifiable people.

The Police can only issue identity documents to Swedish citizens. They issue an internationally recognised identity card according to EU standard usable for intra-European travel, and Swedish passports which are acceptable as identity documents worldwide.

The Transport Agency issues driving licences, which are valid as identity documents in Sweden. To obtain one, one must be approved as a driver and strictly have another Swedish identity document as proof of identity.

In the past there have been certain groups that have experienced problems obtaining valid identification documents. This was due to the initial process that was required to validate one&#x27;s identity, unregulated security requirements by the commercial companies which issued them. Since July 2009, the Tax Agency has begun to issue ID cards, which has simplified the identity validation process for foreign passport holders. There are still requirements for identity validation that can cause trouble, especially for foreign citizens, but the list of people who can validate one&#x27;s identity has been extended.

===== Switzerland =====
Swiss citizens have no obligation of identification in Switzerland and thus, are not required by law to be able to show a valid identity document upon request by a police officer or similar official. Furthermore, identity documents are required when opening a bank account or when dealing with public administration.

Relevant in daily life of Swiss citizens are Swiss ID card and Swiss driver&#x27;s license; the latter needs to be presented upon request by a police officer, when driving a motor-vehicle as e.g., a car, a motorcycle, a bus or a truck. Swiss citizens are entitled to use a valid national identity card to exercise their right of free movement in EFTA and the EU.

Swiss passport is needed only for e.g., travel abroad to countries not accepting Swiss ID card as travel document.
====Other European countries====

=====Andorra=====

No national identity card in the principality. Passports and driving licenses are most commonly used for identification. When visiting France or Spain a passport is needed in lack of a national identity card, although driving licenses are often used and accepted unofficially.

=====Albania=====

From January 12, 2009, the Government of Albania is issuing a compulsory electronic and biometric ID Card &quot;(Letërnjoftim)&quot; for its citizens. Every citizen at age 16 must apply for Biometric ID card.

=====Azerbaijan=====

Azerbaijan issues a compulsory ID Card &quot;(Şəxsiyyət vəsiqəsi)&quot; for its citizens.

Every citizen at age 16 must apply for ID card.

=====Belarus=====

Belarus has combined the international passport and the internal passport into one document which is compulsory from age 14. It follows the international passport convention but has extra pages for domestic use.

=====Bosnia and Herzegovina=====


Bosnia and Herzegovina allows every person over the age of 15 to apply for an ID card, and all citizens over the age of 18 must have the national ID card with them at all times. A penalty is issued if the citizen does not have the acquired ID card on them or if the citizen refuses to show proof of identification.

=====Kosovo=====
The Kosovo Identity Card is an ID card issued to the citizens of Kosovo for the purpose of establishing their identity, as well as serving as proof of residency, right to work and right to public benefits. It can be used instead of a passport for travel to some neighboring countries.

=====Moldova=====
In Moldova, identity cards () have been issued since 1996. The first person to get identity card was former president of Moldova – Mircea Snegur. Since then, all the Moldovan citizens are required to have and use it inside the country. It cannot be used to travel outside the country; however, it is possible to pass the so-called Transnistrian border with it.

The Moldovan identity card may be obtained by a child from his/her date of birth. The state Public Services Agency is responsible for issuing identity cards and for storing data of all Moldovan citizens.

=====Monaco=====
Monégasque identity cards are issued to Monégasque citizens and can be used for travel within the Schengen Area. 

=====Montenegro=====

In Montenegro every resident citizen over the age of 14 can have their &quot;Lična karta&quot; issued, and all persons over the age of 18 must have ID cards and carry them at all times when they are in public places. It can be used for international travel to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, North Macedonia, Kosovo and Albania instead of the passport.

=====North Macedonia=====
The identity card of North Macedonia () is a compulsory identity document issued in North Macedonia. The document is issued by the police on behalf of the Ministry of Interior. Every citizen over 18 must be issued this identity card.

=====Russia=====


The role of identity documentation is primarily played by the so-called Russian internal passport, a passport-size booklet which contains a person&#x27;s photograph, birth information and other data such as registration at the place of residence (informally known as propiska), marital data, information about military service and underage children. Internal passports are issued by the Main Directorate for Migration Affairs to all citizens who reach their 14th birthday and do not reside outside Russia. They are re-issued at the age 20 and 45.

The internal passport is commonly considered the only acceptable ID document in governmental offices, banks, while traveling by train or plane, getting a subscription service, etc. If the person does not have an internal passport (i.e., foreign nationals or Russian citizens who live abroad), an international passport can be accepted instead, theoretically in all cases. Another exception is army conscripts, who produce the Identity Card of the Russian Armed Forces.

Internal passports can also be used to travel to Belarus, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Abkhazia and South Ossetia.

Other documents, such as driver&#x27;s licenses or student cards, can sometimes be accepted as ID, subject to regulations.

=====San Marino=====

The national identity card is compulsory for all Sanmarinese citizens. Biometric and valid for international travel since 2016.

=====Serbia=====

In Serbia every resident citizen over the age of 10 can have their &quot;Lična karta&quot; issued, and all persons over the age of 16 must have ID cards and carry them at all times when they are in public places. It can be used for international travel to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Macedonia instead of the passport. Contact microchip on ID is optional.

Kosovo issues its own identity cards. These documents are accepted by Serbia when used as identification while crossing the Serbia-Kosovo border. They can also be used for international travel to Montenegro and Albania.

=====Turkey=====
The Turkish national ID card () is compulsory for all Turkish citizens from birth. Cards for males and females have a different color. The front shows the first and last name of the holder, first name of legal ascendants, birth date and place, and an 11 digit ID number. The back shows marital status, religious affiliation, the region of the county of origin, and the date of issue of the card. On February 2, 2010, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in a 6 to 1 vote that the religious affiliation section of the Turkish identity card violated articles 6, 9, and 12 of the European Convention of Human Rights, to which Turkey is a signatory. The ruling should coerce the Turkish government to completely omit religious affiliation on future identity cards. The Turkish police are allowed to ask any person to show ID, and refusing to comply may lead to arrest. It can be used for international travel to Northern Cyprus, Georgia and Ukraine instead of a passport.

Ministry of Interior of Turkey released EU-like identity cards for all Turkish citizens in 2017. New identity cards are fully biometric and can be used as a bank card, bus ticket or at international trips.

=====Ukraine=====
The Ukrainian identity card or Passport of the Citizen of Ukraine (also known as the Internal passport or Passport Card) is an identity document issued to citizens of Ukraine. Every Ukrainian citizen aged 14 or above and permanently residing in Ukraine must possess an identity card issued by local authorities of the State Migration Service of Ukraine.

Ukrainian identity cards are valid for 10 years (or 4 years, if issued for citizens aged 14 but less than 18) and afterwards must be exchanged for a new document.

=====United Kingdom=====

As of July 2021, the UK has no national identity card and has no general obligation of identification, although drivers may be required to produce their licence and insurance documents to a police station within 7 days of a traffic stop if they are not able to provide them at the time.

The UK had an identity card during World War II as part of a package of emergency powers; this was abolished in 1952 by repealing the National Registration Act 1939. Identity cards were first proposed in the mid-1980s for people attending football matches, following a series of high-profile hooliganism incidents involving English football fans. However, this proposed identity card scheme never went ahead as Lord Taylor of Gosforth ruled it out as &quot;unworkable&quot; in the Taylor Report of 1990.

The Identity Cards Act 2006 implemented a national ID scheme backed by a National Identity Register – an ambitious database linking a variety of data including Police, Health, Immigration, Electoral Rolls and other records. Several groups such as No2ID formed to campaign against ID cards in Britain and more importantly the NIR database, which was seen as a &quot;panopticon&quot; and a significant threat to civil liberties. The scheme saw setbacks after the Loss of United Kingdom child benefit data (2007) and other high-profile data losses turned public opinion against the government storing large, linked personal datasets.

Various partial rollouts were attempted such as compulsory identity cards for non-EU residents in Britain (starting late 2008), with voluntary registration for British nationals introduced in 2009 and mandatory registration proposed for certain high-security professions such as airport workers. However, the mandatory registrations met with resistance from unions such as the British Airline Pilots&#x27; Association.

After the 2010 general election a new coalition government was formed. Both parties had pledged to scrap ID cards in their election manifestos. The 2006 act was repealed by the Identity Documents Act 2010 which also required that the nascent NIR database be destroyed. The Home Office announced that the national identity register had been destroyed on February 10, 2011. Prior to the 2006 Act, work had started to update British passports with RFID chips to support the use of ePassport gates. This continued, with traditional passports being replaced with RFID versions on renewal.

Driving licences, particularly the photocard driving licence introduced in 1998, and passports are now the most widely used ID documents in the United Kingdom, but the former cannot be used as travel documents, except within the Common Travel Area. However, driving licences from the UK and EU countries are usually accepted within EU and EFTA countries for identity verification. Most people do not carry their passports in public without knowing in advance that they are going to need them as they do not fit in a typical wallet and are relatively expensive to replace. Consequently, driving licences are the most common and convenient form of ID in use, along with PASS-accredited cards, used mainly for proof-of-age purposes. Unlike a travel document, they do not show the holder&#x27;s nationality or immigration status. For proof-of-age purchases, a provisional driving license is often used by those who do not hold a full driving license, as they are easy to obtain. 

Generally, in day-to-day life, most authorities do not ask for identification from individuals in a sudden, spot-check type manner, such as by police or security guards, although this may become a concern in instances of stop and search.

======Gibraltar======
Gibraltar has operated an identity card system since 1943.

The cards issued were originally folded cardboard, similar to the wartime UK Identity cards abolished in 1950. There were different colours for British and non-British residents. Gibraltar requires all residents to hold identity cards, which are issued free.

In 1993 the cardboard ID card was replaced with a laminated version. However, although valid as a travel document to the UK, they were not accepted by Spain.

A new version in an EU-compliant format was issued and is valid for use throughout the EU, although as very few are seen, there are sometimes problems when used, even in the UK. ID cards are needed for some financial transactions, but apart from that and to cross the frontier with Spain, they are not in common use.

===North America===

====Belize====
Called the &quot;Identification Card R.R&quot;. Optional, although compulsory for voting and other government transactions. Available also for any Commonwealth country citizen who has lived in Belize for a year without leaving and been at least 2 months in an area where the person has been registered in.

====Canada====
In Canada, different forms of identification documentation are used, but there is no de jure national identity card. The Canadian passport is issued by the federal (national) government, and the provinces and territories issue various documents which can be used for identification purposes. The most commonly used forms of identification within Canada are the health card and driver&#x27;s licence issued by provincial and territorial governments. The widespread usage of these two documents for identification purposes has made them de facto identity cards.

In Canada, a driver&#x27;s license usually lists the name, home address, height and date of birth of the bearer. A photograph of the bearer is usually present, as well as additional information, such as restrictions to the bearer&#x27;s driving licence. The bearer is required by law to keep the address up to date.

A few provinces, such as Québec and Ontario, issue provincial health care cards which contain identification information, such as a photo of the bearer, their home address, and their date of birth. British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Ontario are among the provinces that produce photo identification cards for individuals who do not possess a driving licence, with the cards containing the bearer&#x27;s photo, home address, and date of birth.

For travel abroad, a passport is almost always required. There are a few minor exceptions to this rule; required documentation to travel among North American countries is subject to the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, such as the NEXUS programme and the Enhanced Drivers License programme implemented by a few provincial governments as a pilot project. These programmes have not yet gained widespread acceptance, and the Canadian passport remains the most useful and widely accepted international travel document.

====Cayman Islands====
Optional and not fully launched. Legislation was enacted in 2022.

====Costa Rica====
Every Costa Rican citizen must carry an identity card immediately after turning 18. The card is named &quot;Cédula de Identidad&quot; and it is issued by the local registrar&#x27;s office (&quot;Registro Civil&quot;), an office belonging to the local elections committee (&quot;Tribunal Supremo de Elecciones&quot;), which in Costa Rica has the same rank as the Supreme Court. Each card has a unique number composed of nine numerical digits, the first of them being the province where the citizen was born (with other significance in special cases such as granted citizenship to foreigners, adopted persons, or in rare cases, old people for whom no birth certificate was processed at birth). After this digit, two blocks of four digits follow; the combination corresponds to the unique identifier of the citizen.

It is widely requested as part of every legal and financial purpose, often requested at payment with credit or debit cards for identification guarantee and requested for buying alcoholic beverages or cigarettes or upon entrance to adults-only places like bars.

The card must be renewed every ten years and is freely issued again if lost. Among the information included there are, on the front, two identification pictures and digitized signature of the owner, identification number (known colloquially just as the &quot;cédula&quot;), first name, first and second-last names and an optional &quot;known as&quot; field. On the back, there is again the identification number, birth date, where the citizen issues its vote for national elections or referendums, birthplace, gender, date when it must be renewed and a matrix code that includes all this information and even a digitized fingerprint of the thumb and index finger.

The matrix code is not currently being used nor inspected by any kind of scanner.

Besides this identification card, every vehicle driver must carry a driving licence, an additional card that uses the same identification number as the ID card (Cédula de Identidad) for the driving license number. A passport is also issued with the same identification number used in the ID card. The same situation occurs with the Social Security number; it is the same number used for the ID card.

All non-Costa Rican citizens with a &quot;resident status&quot; must carry an ID card (&quot;Cédula de Residencia&quot;), otherwise, a passport and a valid visa. Each resident&#x27;s ID card has a unique number composed of 12 digits; the first three of them indicate their nationality and the rest of them a sequence used by the immigration authority (called Dirección General de Migración y Extranjería). As with the Costa Rican citizens, their Social Security number and their driver&#x27;s license (if they have it) would use the same number as in their own resident&#x27;s ID card.

====Dominican Republic====
A &quot;Cédula de Identidad y Electoral&quot; (Identity and Voting Document) is a National ID that is also used for voting in both Presidential and Congressional ballots. Each &quot;Cédula de Identidad y Electoral&quot; has its unique serial number composed by the serial of the municipality of current residence, a sequential number plus a verification digit. This National ID card is issued to all legal residents of adult age. It is usually required to validate job applications, legally binding contracts, official documents, buying/selling real estate, opening a personal bank account, obtaining a Driver&#x27;s License and the like. It is issued free of charge by the &quot;Junta Central Electoral&quot; (Central Voting Committee) to all Dominicans not living abroad at the time of reaching adulthood (16 years of age) or younger is they are legally emancipated. Foreigners who have taken permanent residence and have not yet applied for Dominican naturalization (i.e., have not opted for Dominican citizenship but have taken permanent residence) are required to pay an issuing tariff and must bring along their non-expired Country of Origin passport and deposit photocopies of their Residential Card and Dominican Red Cross Blood Type card. Foreigners residing on a permanent basis must renew their &quot;Foreign ID&quot; on a 2-, 4-, or 10-year renewal basis (about US$63–US$240, depending on desired renewal period).

====El Salvador====
In El Salvador, ID Card is called Documento Único de Identidad (DUI) (Unique Identity Document). Every citizen above 18 years must carry this ID for identification purposes at any time. It is not based on a smartcard but on a standard plastic card with two-dimensional bar-coded information with picture and signature.

====Guatemala====
In January 2009, the National Registry of Persons (RENAP) in Guatemala began offering a new identity document in place of the &quot;Cédula de Vecindad&quot; (neighborhood identity document) to all Guatemala citizens and foreigners. The new document is called &quot;Documento Personal de Identification&quot; (DPI) (Personal Identity Document). It is based on a smartcard with a chip and includes an electronic signature and several measures against fraud.

====Jamaica====
Optional, although compulsory for voting and other government transactions. Since 2022 a brand new biometric National ID Card has been unveiled, free of charge for Jamaican citizens.

====Mexico====

Not mandatory, but needed in almost all official documents, the CURP is the standardized version of an identity document. It actually could be a printed green wallet-sized card (without a photo) or simply an 18-character identification key printed on a birth or death certificate.

While Mexico has a national identity card (&quot;cédula de identitad personal&quot;), it is only issued to children aged 4–17.

Unlike most other countries, Mexico has assigned a CURP to nearly all minors, since both the government and most private schools ask parent(s) to supply their children&#x27;s CURP to keep a data base of all the children. Also, minors must produce their CURP when applying for a passport or being registered at Public Health services by their parent(s).

Most adults need the CURP code too, since it is required for almost all governmental paperwork like tax filings and passport applications. Most companies ask for a prospective employee&#x27;s CURP, voting card, or passport rather than birth certificates.

To have a CURP issued for a person, a birth certificate or similar proof must be presented to the issuing authorities to prove that the information supplied on the application is true. Foreigners applying for a CURP must produce a certificate of legal residence in Mexico. Foreign-born naturalized Mexican citizens must present their naturalization certificate.
On August 21, 2008, the Mexican cabinet passed the National Security Act, which compels all Mexican citizens to have a biometric identity card, called Citizen Identity Card (&quot;Cédula de identidad ciudadana&quot;) before 2011.

On February 13, 2009, the Mexican government designated the state of Tamaulipas to start procedures for issuing a pilot program of the national Mexican ID card.

Although the CURP is the &quot;de jure&quot; official identification document in Mexico, the Instituto Nacional Electoral&#x27;s voting card is the &quot;de facto&quot; official identification and proof of legal age for citizens of ages 18 and older.

On July 28, 2009, Mexican President Felipe Calderón, facing the Mexican House of Representatives, announced the launch of the Mexican national Identity card project, which will see the first card issued before the end of 2009.

====Panama====
The &quot;cédula de identidad personal&quot; is required at age 12 (&quot;cedula juvenil&quot;) and age 18. Panamanian citizens must carry their &quot;cédula&quot; at all times. New biometric national identity cards rolled out in 2019. The card must be renewed every 10 years (every 5 years for those under 18), and it can only be replaced 3 times (with each replacement costing more than the previous one) without requiring a background check, to confirm and verify that the card holder is not selling his or her identity to third parties for human trafficking or other criminal activities. All cards have QR, PDF417, and Code 128 barcodes. The QR code holds all printed (on the front of the card) text information about the card holder, while the PDF417 barcode holds, in JPEG format encoded with Base64, an image of the fingerprint of the left index finger of the card holder. Panamanian biometric/electronic/machine readable ID cards are similar to biometric passports and current European/Czech national ID cards and have only a small PDF417 barcode, with a machine readable area, a contactless smart card RFID chip, and golden contact pads similar to those found in smart card credit cards and SIM cards. The machine-readable code contains all printed text information about the card holder (it replaces the QR code) while both chips (the smart card chip is hidden under the golden contact pads) contain all personal information about the card holder along with a JPEG photo of the card holder, a JPEG photo with the card holder&#x27;s signature, and another JPEG photo but with all 10 fingerprints of both hands of the card holder. Earlier cards used Code 16K and Code 49 barcodes with magnetic stripes.

====United States====

There is no compulsory federal-level ID card that is issued to all U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens and nationals may obtain passports or U.S. passport cards if they choose to, but this is optional and other alternatives are more popular.

For most people, driver&#x27;s licenses issued by the respective state and territorial governments have become the &quot;de facto&quot; identity cards, and are used for many identification purposes, such as when purchasing alcohol and tobacco, opening bank accounts, and boarding planes, along with confirming a voter&#x27;s identity in states with voter photo identification laws. Individuals who do not drive can obtain an identification card with the same functions from the state agency that issues driver&#x27;s licenses. In addition, many schools issue student and teacher ID cards.

The United States passed the REAL ID Act on May 11, 2005. The bill requires states to redesign their driver&#x27;s licenses to comply with federal security standards by December 2009. Federal agencies would then reject licenses or identity cards that do not comply, which would force Americans accessing everything from airplanes to courthouses to have federally mandated cards. At airports, those not having compliant licenses or cards would be redirected to a secondary screening location. As of 2024, every state has implemented some ID that satisfies the standard.

In 2006, the U.S. State Department studied the idea of issuing passports with radio-frequency identification, or RFID, chips embedded in them.

The United States passport verifies both personal identity and citizenship, but is not mandatory for citizens to possess within the country and is issued by the U.S. State Department on a discretionary basis.

Since February 1, 2008, U.S. citizens may apply for passport cards, in addition to the usual passport books. Although their main purpose is for land and sea travel within North America, the passport card may also be accepted by federal authorities (such as for domestic air travel or entering federal buildings). The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) accepts the passport card as an identity document at airport security checkpoints.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services allows the U.S. passport card to be used in the Employment Eligibility Verification Form I-9 (form) process. The passport card is considered a &quot;List A&quot; document that may be presented by newly hired employees during the employment eligibility verification process to show work authorized status. &quot;List A&quot; documents are those used by employees to prove both identity and work authorization when completing the Form I-9.

The basic document needed to establish a person&#x27;s identity and citizenship in order to obtain a passport is a birth certificate. These are issued by either the U.S. state of birth or by the U.S. Department of State for overseas births to U.S. citizens. A child born in the U.S. is in nearly all cases (except for children of foreign diplomats) automatically a U.S. citizen. The parents of a child born overseas to U.S. citizens can report the birth to the U.S. embassy/consulate to obtain a Consular Report of Birth Abroad.

Social Security numbers (SSNs) and cards are issued by the U.S. Social Security Administration for tracking Social Security taxes and benefits. They have become the &quot;de facto&quot; national identification number for federal and state taxation, private financial services, and identification with various companies. SSNs do not establish citizenship because they can also be issued to permanent residents. They typically can only be part of the establishment of a person&#x27;s identity; a photo ID that verifies date of birth is also usually requested.

A mix of documents can be presented to, for instance, verify one&#x27;s legal eligibility to take a job within the United States. &quot;Identity&quot; and &quot;citizenship&quot; is established by presenting a passport alone, but this must be accompanied by a Social Security card for taxation ID purposes. A driver&#x27;s license/state ID establishes &quot;identity&quot; alone, but does not establish &quot;citizenship&quot;, as these can be provided to non-citizens as well. In this case, an applicant without a passport may sign an affidavit of citizenship or be required to present a birth certificate. They must also submit their Social Security number.

&quot;Residency&quot; within a certain U.S. jurisdiction, such as a voting precinct, can be proven if the driver&#x27;s license or state ID has the home address printed on it corresponding to that jurisdiction. Utility bills or other pieces of official printed mail can also suffice for this purpose. In the case of voter registration, citizenship must also be proven with a passport, birth certificate, or signed citizenship affidavit.

The Selective Service System has in the past, in times of a military draft, issued an identification card for men that were eligible for the draft.

===Oceania===

====Australia====

Australia does not have a national identity card. Instead, various identity documents are used or required to prove a person&#x27;s identity, whether for government or commercial purposes.

Currently, driver licences and photo cards, both issued by the states and territories, are the most widely used personal identification documents in Australia. Additionally, the Australia Post Keypass identity card, issued by Australia Post, can be used by people who do not have an Australian drivers licence or an Australian state and territory issued identity photo card.

Photo cards are also called &quot;Proof of Age Cards&quot; or similar and can be issued to people as another type of identity. Identification indicating age is commonly required to purchase alcohol and tobacco and to enter nightclubs and gambling venues.

Other important identity documents include a passport, an official birth certificate, an official marriage certificate, cards issued by government agencies (typically social security cards), some cards issued by commercial organisations (e.g., a debit or credit card), and utility accounts. Often, some combination of identity documents is required, such as an identity document linking a name, photograph and signature (typically photo-ID in the form of a driver licence or passport), evidence of operating in the community, and evidence of a current residential address.

New alcohol laws in the state of Queensland require some Brisbane-based pubs and bars to scan ID documents against a database of people who should be denied alcohol, for which foreign passports and driver&#x27;s licences are not valid.

====Marshall Islands====
An &quot;Identification Card&quot; seems to exists among citizens of the Marshall Islands, but little information is found on these documents.

====Micronesia====
National Identity cards, called &quot;FSM Voters National Identity card&quot;, are issued on an optional basis, free of charge. The Identity Cards were introduced in 2005.

====New Zealand====

New Zealand does not have an official ID card. The most commonly carried form of identification is a driver licence issued by the Transport Agency.

Other forms of special purpose identification documents are issued by different government departments, for example a Firearms Licence issued to gun owners by the Police and the SuperGold card issued to elderly people by the Ministry of Social Development.

For purchasing alcohol or tobacco, the only legal forms of identification is a New Zealand or foreign passport, a New Zealand driver licences and a Kiwi Access Card (formerly known as 18+ cards) from the Hospitality Association of New Zealand. Overseas driver licences are not legal for this purpose.

For opening a bank account, each bank has its own list of documents that it will accept. Generally speaking, banks accept a foreign or NZ passport, a NZ Firearms Licence, or a foreign ID card by itself. If the customer do not have these documents, they will need to produce two different documents on the approved list (for example a driver licence and a marriage certificate).

====Palau====
Republic of Palau Identification Cards are primarily issued to foreign nationals whom are not eligible to acquire a Palau passport or driver&#x27;s license, under the Digital Residency Act. Foreign nationals are required to undergo a sanctions check.

====Papua New Guinea====
E-National ID cards were rolled out in 2015.

====Solomon Islands====
&quot;National Voter&#x27;s Identity card&quot; are optional upon request.

====Tonga====
Tonga&#x27;s National ID Card was first issued in 2010, and it is optional, along with the driver&#x27;s licenses and passports. Either one of these are mandatory for to vote though. Applicants need to be 14 years of age or older to apply for a National ID Card.

====Vanuatu====
National Identity Cards are being issued since October 2017. Plans for rolling out biometric cards were due for the late 2018.

===South America===
====Argentina====
Documento Nacional de Identidad (DNI; &quot;National Identity Document&quot;) is the main identity document for Argentine residents. It is issued as a card (tarjeta DNI) at birth to all people born in the country (and hence citizens), and to foreigners who register as residents with the National Directorate of Migrations. It must be updated at 8 and 14 years of age, and thereafter every 15 years. The documents are produced at a special plant in Buenos Aires by the Argentine national registry of people (ReNaPer).
The National Identity Document (DNI) is the sole instrument for personal identification and is mandatory. Its format and use are regulated by Law No. 17671 on Identification, Registration, and Classification of the National Human Potential, enacted in 1968, replacing the enrolment document issued to men undergoing mandatory military service and &quot;libreta cívica&quot; given to women upon turning 18.

According to this law, the DNI cannot be substituted by any other document for legal purposes. It is required for voting, which is mandatory, and for identification before judicial authorities. The Argentine DNI is also required for conducting procedures with state authorities, and entitles adult bearers to work within the country.

From November 4, 2009, as part of a modernization and digitization process of national documents, a new type of DNI with both a booklet and a card was issued; either may be used for most purposes, but the booklet had to be used for voting.

The DNI booklet had a light blue cover with laser printing for the citizen&#x27;s unique number and silver prints for the rest of the presentation. Internally, it had an identical design to the card format but included spaces for marital status, address changes, organ donations, and the stamping of the DNI after voting in national elections. The card was entirely laminated and contained all the individual&#x27;s data, including a photograph and fingerprint impression.

From 2011, the DNI underwent further changes, with no booklet and a different card design, a higher-quality plastic card to be used for all purposes. The booklet was no longer required for voting by holders of the still-valid 2009 version. Since April 1, 2017, the DNI card is the only valid identification document. Taxpayers also have a Unique Tax Identification Code (CUIT).
In December 2023, the National Registry of Persons of Argentina (Renaper), a subsidiary of the Ministry of the Interior, introduced the Biometric National Identity Document (DNI). It adheres to international standards of security, with an embedded electronic chip and a QR code for electronic validation, identity verification, digital functions, and advanced security measures.

Manufactured using laser technology on polycarbonate, a durable material, the new document has up-to-date physical security features to enhance visual verification and prevent counterfeiting.

====Brazil====
In Brazil, at the age of 18, all Brazilian citizens are supposed to be issued a &quot;cédula de identidade&quot; (ID card), usually known by its number, the &quot;Registro Geral (RG)&quot;, Portuguese for &quot;General Registry&quot;. The cards are needed to obtain a job, to vote, and to use credit cards. Foreigners living in Brazil have a different kind of ID card. Since the RG is not unique, being issued in a state-basis, in many places the CPF (the Brazilian revenue agency&#x27;s identification number) is used as a replacement. The current Brazilian driver&#x27;s license contains both the RG and the CPF, and as such can be used as an identification card as well.

There are plans in course to replace the current RG system with a new &quot;Documento Nacional de Identificação&quot; (National Identification Document), which will be electronic (accessible by a mobile application) and national in scope, and to change the current ID card to a new smartcard.

==== Colombia ====

Upon turning 18 every resident in Colombia must obtain an identity document ( or &quot;Documento de Identidad&quot;, which is the only document that proves the identity of a person for legal purposes. ID cards must be carried at all times and must be presented to the police upon request. If the individual fails to present the ID card upon request by the police or the military, he/she is most likely going to be detained at police station even if he/she is not a suspect of any wrongdoing. ID cards are needed to obtain employment, open bank accounts, obtain a passport, driver&#x27;s license, military card, to enroll in educational institutions, vote or enter public buildings including airports and courthouses; failure to produce ID is a misdemeanor punishable with a fine. ID duplicate costs must be assumed by citizens. Every resident over the age of 14 is issued an identity card called (&quot;Tarjeta de Identidad&quot;)

====Chile====

Every resident of Chile over the age of 18 must have and carry at all times their ID Card called &quot;Cédula de Identidad&quot; issued by the Civil Registry and Identification Service of Chile.

The identity card is the official document that proves the identity of a Chilean person. Among the data it contains is the full name, Unique National Role (RUN) and sex, in addition to the photo, signature and fingerprint. Anyone who wants their profession to appear on their identity card must be registered in the professional registry.

This is the only official form of identification for residents in Chile and is widely used and accepted as such. It is necessary for every contract, most bank transactions, voting, driving (along with the driver&#x27;s licence) and other public and private situations. Biometrics collection is mandatory.

====Peru====

In Peru, it is mandatory for all citizens over the age of 18, whether born inside or outside the territory of the Republic, to obtain a National Identity Document (&quot;Documento Nacional de Identidad&quot;).
The DNI is a public, personal and untransferable document.

The DNI is the only means of identification permitted for participating in any civil, legal, commercial, administrative, and judicial acts. It is also required for voting and must be presented to authorities upon request. The DNI can be used as a passport to travel to all South American countries that are members of UNASUR.

The DNI is issued by the National Registry of Identification and Civil Status (RENIEC). For Peruvians abroad, service is provided through the Consulates of Peru, in accordance with Articles 26, 31 and 8 of Law No. 26,497.

The document is card-sized as defined by ISO format ID-1 (prior to 2005 the DNI was size ISO ID-2; renewal of the card due to the size change was not mandatory, nor did previously-emitted cards lose validity). The front of the card presents photographs of the holder&#x27;s face, their name, date and place of birth (the latter in coded form), gender and marital status; the bottom quarter consists of machine-readable text. Three dates are listed as well; the date the citizen was first registered at RENIEC; the date the document was issued; and the expiration date of the document. The back of the DNI features the holder&#x27;s address (including district, department and/or province) and voting group. Eight voting record blocks are successively covered with metallic labels when the citizen presents themselves at their voting group on voting days. The back also denotes whether the holder is an organ donor, presents the holder&#x27;s right index finger print, a PDF417 bar code, and a 1D bar code.

====Uruguay====

In Uruguay, the identity card (&quot;documento de identidad&quot;) is issued by the Ministry of the Interior and the National Civil Identification Bureau (&quot;Dirección Nacional de Identificación Civil&quot; | DNIC).

It is mandatory and essential for several activities at either governmental or private levels. The document is mandatory for all inhabitants of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, whether they are native citizens, legal citizens, or resident aliens in the country, even for children as young as 45 days old.

It is a laminated card wide and approximately high, dominated by the color blue, showing the flag in the background with the photo of the owner, the number assigned by the DNIC (including a self-generated or check digit), full name, and the corresponding signature along with biometrics. The card is bilingual in Spanish and Portuguese.

Identity cards are required for most formal transactions, from credit card purchases to any identity validation, proof of age, and so on. The identity card is not to be confused with the &quot;Credencial Cívica&quot;, which is used exclusively for voting.

====Venezuela====

Identity cards in Venezuela consist of a plastic-laminated paper which contains the national ID number (&quot;Cédula de Identidad&quot;) as well as a color-photo and the last names, given names, date of birth, right thumb print, signature, and marital status (single, married, divorced, widowed) of the bearer. It also contains the documents expedition and expiration date. Two different prefixes can be found before the ID number: &quot;V&quot; for Venezuelans and &quot;E&quot; for foreigners (&quot;extranjeros&quot; in Spanish). This distinction is also shown in the document at the very bottom by a bold all-caps typeface displaying either the word VENEZOLANO or EXTRANJERO, respectively.

Despite Venezuela being the second country in the Americas (after the United States) to adopt a biometric passport, the current Venezuelan ID document is remarkably low-security, even for regional standards. It can hardly be called a card. The paper inside the laminated cover contains only two security measures, first, it is a special type of government-issued paper, and second, it has microfilaments in the paper that glow in the presence of UV light. The laminated cover itself is very simplistic and quite large for the paper it covers and the photo, although is standard sized (3x3.5 cm) is rather blurred. Government officials in charge of issuing the document openly recommend each individual to cut the excess plastic off and re-laminate the document in order to protect it from bending. The requirements for getting a Venezuelan identity document are quite relaxed and Venezuela lacks high-security in its birth certificates and other documents that give claim to citizenship.

<text>Translatio studii (Latin for &quot;transfer of learning&quot;) is a historiographical concept which originated in the Middle Ages in which history is viewed as a linear succession of transfers of knowledge or learning from one geographical place and time to another. The concept is closely linked to &quot;translatio imperii&quot;, which similarly describes the movement of imperial dominance. Both terms are thought to have their origins in the second chapter of the Book of Daniel in the Hebrew Bible (verses 39–40).

==History of the concept==

&quot;Translatio studii&quot; is a celebrated topos in medieval literature, most notably articulated in the prologue to Chrétien de Troyes&#x27;s &quot;Cligès&quot;, composed ca. 1170. There, Chrétien explains that Greece was first the seat of all knowledge, then it came to Rome, and now it has come to France, where, by the grace of God, it shall remain forevermore.

In the Renaissance and later, historians saw the metaphorical light of learning as moving much as the light of the sun did: westward. According to this notion, the first center of learning was Eden, followed by Jerusalem, and Babylon. From there, the light of learning moved westward to Athens, and then west to Rome. After Rome, learning moved west to Paris. From there, enlightenment purportedly moved west to London, though other nations laid claim to the mantle, most notably Russia, which would involve a retrograde motion and rupture in the westerly direction. The metaphor of &quot;translatio studii&quot; went out of fashion in the 18th century, but such English Renaissance authors as George Herbert were already predicting that learning would move next to America.

A pessimistic corollary metaphor is the &quot;translatio stultitiae&quot; [&quot;transfer of stupidity&quot;]. As learning moves west, as the earth turns and light falls ever westward, so night follows and claims the places learning has departed from. The metaphor of the &quot;translatio stultitiae&quot; informs Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;Dunciad,&quot; and particularly book IV of the &quot;Greater Dunciad&quot; of 1741, which opens with the nihilistic invocation:

&lt;poem&gt;
Yet, yet a moment, one dim Ray of Light
Indulge, dread Chaos, and eternal Night!&quot; (&quot;B&quot; IV 1-2)

Suspend a while your Force inertly strong,
Then take at once the Poet, and the Song. (ibid. 7-8)
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Etymology==

While the term &quot;translatio studii&quot; literally means in English the translation of studies, there is an implication within the concept that the transmission of learning also carried with it cultural ideals and information. That being said, there is a lot more to &quot;translatio studii&quot; than the simple movement of common concepts from the Mediterranean westward.

According to Karlheinz Stierle, English is what we might consider the current language of this sort of transmission, but &quot;what English is today...Latin was in the first centuries after Christ.&quot; In the way that politics and social issues move circulate around the world very often in English, these same concepts traveled along the developing roads from Greece and Italy to England during medieval times. As religion spread from Rome to Londinium (or present day Britain) it brought with it other concepts that can still be seen in the Romance languages.

An interesting example of this is the term &quot;translatio&quot; itself. In Ancient times &quot;translatio&quot; in Latin meant both &quot;translation&quot; and &quot;transfer&quot;. As time went on, &quot;translatio&quot; was designated to only mean transmission and &quot;traductio&quot; took on the meaning of what we know as translation. This carried over to the developing Romance languages as time went on. The words &quot;translation&quot; in French and &quot;traslazione&quot; in Italian mean the displacement of physical objects, and these languages still use other words to mean &quot;translation&quot; in the English sense. In this way, it is clear that historically the significance of &quot;translatio studii&quot; concerns the transfer of ideas that hold cultural value.

==&quot;Translatio imperii&quot;==

&quot;Translatio imperii&quot; often served as a precedent or coordinate to &quot;translatio studii&quot;. A transferral of rule assisted a transferral of culture, and vice versa: &quot;The transferal of power also conveys the phoenix-like reestablishment of culture - as fictionalized in and transmitted by literature - which establishes each new imperial power as the new stronghold of the culturally elite.&quot;

As it is concerned with the progress of learning, &quot;translatio studii&quot; provides an overview of intellectual heritage. Although it may be considered from various angles (e.g., history, linguistics, and literature) the concept of &quot;translatio studii&quot; is fundamentally concerned with texts. &quot;Reading, translating, commenting, interpreting, rewriting — all are common intertextual activities of the &quot;translatio studii&quot;.&quot;

&quot;Translatio studii&quot; is based on the assumption that human learning and the potential for human learning originated in Greece from whence it spread westward to Rome and then France.

Chrétien de Troyes, a French poet of the late 12th century, writes of &quot;translatio studii&quot; in the opening of Cligès:

==Ancient Greek and Roman theatre==

All Roman comedy stems from Greek New Comedy but rewritten in Latin with slight adjustments to local taste and the long, narrow stage of Roman theatre. It keeps the characteristics of conventional situations from domestic life and stock character-masks that were traditional in the Greek model.

Roman theatre in turn influenced theatre of the Renaissance. &quot;The nine Greek-style tragedies of Seneca (c. 4 B.C.E. -65 C.E.) are especially noteworthy, partly because they were to have a more profound influence on Renaissance tragedians than their Greek originals.&quot; Conventions commonly associated with Renaissance tragedies, most popularly Shakespeare, that are owed to Seneca, are revenge tragedies, structure of five acts, use of elaborate speeches, soliloquies, and asides, violence and horror performed on stage (as opposed to Greek tragedies in which all such actions occurred off stage), and an interest in the human condition, morality of nobility, and the supernatural, specifically with its human connection.

Rome also used the Greek language as a model on which to aid the expansion of its power and secure a language for its empire. According to L. G. Kelly, author of &quot;The True Interpreter: A History of Translation Theory and Practice in the West&quot; (1979), &quot;Western Europe owes its civilization to its translators.&quot;

==Anglo-Norman &quot;cortoisie&quot; and &quot;romanz&quot;==

&quot;Cortoisie&quot; is a synthesis of the superiority of French knighthood and learning. As a new distinction of the French knight, &quot;cortoisie&quot; implies not only a new style of communication and mastery of language, but a new style of communicative attitude, especially when regarding women. From &quot;cortoisie&quot; comes courtly love, a highly disciplined, self-denying, and respectful social form. Ideally, in this form, the knight honors his lady as something sacred. This new ideal of love called for a new ideal of language, according to Chrétien, and so, translations from old, dead Latin into French, or &quot;romanz&quot;, began. It is this language that replaces Latin as a new and lasting period of high culture, and, in so doing, becomes the real language or medium of &quot;translatio studii&quot;.

<text>Brimstone and Treacle is a 1976 BBC television play by Dennis Potter. Originally intended for broadcast as an episode of the series &quot;Play for Today&quot;, it remained untransmitted until 1987. The play was made into a film version (released in 1982) co-starring Sting. Both versions also star Denholm Elliott.

The play features a middle-aged middle-class couple living in a north London suburb whose life has been catastrophically affected by a hit-and-run accident which has left their beautiful undergraduate daughter totally dependent upon them. Their lives are dramatically changed by the arrival of a mysterious young stranger.

==Plot==
For two years, Tom and Amy Bates have been struggling to cope with their altered lives, after their daughter Pattie (or Patricia) was severely injured in a hit-and-run accident. Pattie is unable to walk, completely dependent upon others for the activities of daily living, and seemingly unable to communicate beyond making unintelligible sounds. Although poorly educated and gullible, Amy firmly believes that Pattie is able to understand what is being said in her presence, whereas Tom has given up all hope of her recovery. In fact, judging from the sounds she makes, Pattie seems to realise what is going on around her, but Tom is beyond noticing.

One day on his way home from work he witnesses a handsome, well-dressed young man collapse in the street. Tom is among the passersby who offer to help him. The young man, who gives his name as Martin Taylor, quickly recovers. A few hours later he turns up at the Bates&#x27;, handing Tom his wallet, which Martin pretends Tom lost in the general hubbub. Though the cash is gone, Tom&#x27;s credit card is still there.

From the moment he enters the house, he casts furtive and knowing glances at the audience (according to the stage directions) so they know at once that he is not what he pretends to be. He claims to have been Pattie&#x27;s fiancé.

He offers to be at Pattie&#x27;s side despite the changed circumstances, and care for her for an unspecified period. Amy in particular jumps at the suggestion; she has not had an hour off since Pattie&#x27;s accident and is stranded in the house without the chance to go even to the hairdressers or do some window-shopping.

Tom is reluctant to accept Martin&#x27;s help. He has always been very choosy about his daughter&#x27;s friends, and as he cannot remember Pattie ever mentioning Martin&#x27;s name, he does not want her to be left alone with what might well be a complete stranger. Eventually Martin wins him over by his excellent cooking and lip service to his politics; Tom has joined the National Front.

At the first opportunity, Martin rapes the helpless Pattie (although in the film version, the rape comes late in the action, precipitating Pattie&#x27;s return to consciousness shortly after he removes her nappy). When Amy comes back from the hairdressers she recognises a change in her daughter&#x27;s facial expression, but attributes it to Martin&#x27;s presence. However, when Martin tries to rape the disabled girl again after Tom and Amy have gone to bed, Pattie starts screaming so loudly that he runs out of the house. When they come to see what has happened to their daughter, they find that she has fully recovered from her disabilities, and though still confused, asks her father what has been happening to her. She also recovers her memories of the events preceding her accident, which result from her discovery of her father&#x27;s infidelity.

==Television version ==

&quot;Brimstone and Treacle&quot; was originally written by Potter as a television play, commissioned, paid for and recorded in 1976 by the BBC, for their series &quot;Play for Today&quot;. The cast were Denholm Elliott (Tom Bates), Michael Kitchen (Martin), Patricia Lawrence (Amy Bates) and Michelle Newell (Pattie); plus minor characters.

The original 1976 play was withdrawn shortly before its scheduled transmission (despite being listed in the &quot;Radio Times&quot;) because then Director of Television Programmes Alasdair Milne found it &quot;nauseating&quot; though &quot;brilliantly made&quot;. It was finally shown in August 1987 and has been released as a DVD. Rewritten by Potter for the stage, the play premiered on 11 October 1977 at the Crucible Theatre, Sheffield and transferred to the West End the following year.

In the introduction to the play script, published in 1978, Potter recalled that &quot;the BBC received several letters of congratulation for &#x27;taking a stand&#x27; against the rising tide etc. of filth etc. and blasphemy etc. which ever threatens etc. to swamp our already beleaguered land&quot;. Justifying the play, he wrote: &quot;&quot;Brimstone and Treacle&quot; is an attempt both to parody certain familiar forms of faith and yet at the same time to give them expression. … we cannot even begin to define &#x27;good&#x27; and &#x27;evil&#x27; without being aware of the interaction between the two. It is from these things the play draws whatever power or whatever disturbance that earned it an unwelcome notoriety.&quot;

==Film adaptation==

A film adaptation was released in 1982. Directed by Richard Loncraine, it stars Denholm Elliott as Bates, Joan Plowright as Norma Bates, Suzanna Hamilton as Pattie, and Sting as Martin. In the film, Mrs. Bates&#x27; first name is Norma instead of Amy.

The soundtrack includes works by The Police, Sting, The Go-Go&#x27;s and Squeeze, while Sting&#x27;s cover of &quot;Spread a Little Happiness&quot; reached No. 16 in the UK Singles Chart.

&quot;Brimstone &amp; Treacle&quot; was released to DVD by MGM Home Video in 2003 as a Region 1 widescreen DVD.

==Potter on &quot;Brimstone and Treacle&quot;==

In 1978, Potter said:I had written &quot;Brimstone and Treacle&quot; in difficult personal circumstances. Years of acute psoriatic arthropathy — unpleasantly affecting skin and joints — had not only taken their toll in physical damage but had also, and perhaps inevitably, mediated my view of the world and the people in it. I recall writing (and the words now make me shudder) that the only meaningful sacrament left to human beings was for them to gather in the streets in order to be sick together, splashing vomit on the paving stones as the final and most eloquent plea to an apparently deaf, dumb and blind God. [...] I was engaged in an extremely severe struggle, not so much against the dull grind of a painful and debilitating illness, but with unresolved, almost unacknowledged &quot;spiritual&quot; questions.

<text>Dura-Europos was a Hellenistic, Parthian, and Roman border city built on an escarpment above the southwestern bank of the Euphrates river. It is located near the village of Al-Salihiyah, in present-day Syria. Dura-Europos was founded around 300 BC by Seleucus I Nicator, who founded the Seleucid Empire as one of the Diadochi of Alexander the Great. In 113 BC, Parthians conquered the city, and held it, with one brief Roman intermission (114 AD), until 165 AD. Under Parthian rule, it became an important provincial administrative centre. The Romans decisively captured Dura-Europos in 165 AD and greatly enlarged it as their easternmost stronghold in Mesopotamia, until it was captured by the Sasanian Empire after a siege in 256–257 AD. Its population was deported, and the abandoned city eventually became covered by sand and mud and disappeared from sight.

Dura-Europos is of extreme archaeological importance, and was called the &quot;Pompeii of the Desert&quot;. As it was abandoned after its conquest in 256–57 AD, nothing was built over it and no later building programs obscured the architectural features of the ancient city. Its location on the edge of empires made for a commingling of cultural traditions, much of which was preserved under the city&#x27;s ruins. Some remarkable finds have been brought to light, including numerous temples, wall decorations, inscriptions, military equipment, tombs, and even dramatic evidence of the Sasanian siege.

It was looted and mostly destroyed between 2011 and 2014 by the Islamic State during the Syrian Civil War.

== History ==
=== Foundation and early history ===
Originally a fortress, the city was founded around 300 BC as Dura (&quot;fortress&quot; in Aramaic), at the intersection of an east–west trade route and the trade route along the Euphrates. The city was called Europos by Greeks in honor of the origin of Seleucus Nikator, who founded it and was born in Europos in Macedonia. In ancient times, either designation stood alone; the combination of &quot;Dura-Europos&quot; is modern, and was coined by Franz Cumont in 1922. Dura controlled the river crossing on the route between Seleucus&#x27;s newly founded cities of Antioch and Seleucia on the Tigris. Its rebuilding as a great city after the Hippodamian model, with rectangular blocks defined by cross-streets ranged round a large central agora, took place in the 2nd century BC. The traditional view of Dura-Europos as a great caravan city is modified by the discoveries of local manufactures and traces of close ties with Palmyra. Dura-Europos is now seen as owing its development to its role as a regional capital. After the siege and destruction of the city its names were forgotten by local people, and the site was known as Salihiyeh, &quot;a name thought to refer to Saladin&quot;. In Ottoman times the ruins were known as Qan Qal&#x27;esi, &quot;Castle of Blood&quot;. Pierre Leriche, excavations director of the site in early 2000s, opposes the name Dura-Europos, because it &quot;obscures what he sees as the fundamental Greekness of the city&quot; and proposes to use &quot;Europos-Dura&quot; instead.

The city was probably built on the site of a previous town; a clay tablet dating to King Hammurabi of Hana&#x27;s times, 1900 BC, refers to the place as &quot;Da-ma-ra&quot;. It is the only cuneiform writing found at Dura; no other evidence was found. The ancient settlement was probably deserted for a long time when Dura was found.

The earliest mention of Dura-Europos can be found in the &quot;Parthian Stations&quot; by the geographer Isidore of Charax (c. 26 BC).

ἔνθεν Δοῦρα, Νικάνορος πόλις, κτίσμα Μακεδόνων, ὑπὸ δὲ Ἑλλήνων Εὔρωπος καλεῖται.[Then comes Dura, the city of Nicanor, a foundation of the Macedonians, called Europos by the Greeks.]

Isidore is the only ancient historian who mentioned that the city had two different names. Isidore&#x27;s account helped to identify the site, because both &quot;Dura&quot; and &quot;Europos&quot; were not unique names for that region.

When the town was founded, agricultural land was allotted to the members of the garrison, the size and quality of the allotments according to military rank. As the historian Paul Kosmin wrote, during its early history Dura-Europos was neither entirely a military outpost nor a polis, but something in-between:

Out of this meager evidence, the early settlement of Europos emerges as an entity ambiguously situated between a simple fortress and a full &quot;polis&quot;. The absences are striking. As far as can be perceived, in terms of civic architecture and urbanism, third-century Europos lacked a temple, gymnasium, theater, and a &quot;Hippodamian&quot; street plan. In terms of sociopolitical phenomena, it lacked a developed epigraphic habit, representative civic government, sophisticated bureaucracy, and its own mint (bar one short episode). The administrative center (&quot;palace&quot;), patterns of land ownership, royal cult, and state officials show, however, it was more than a fortified army community, isolated from its local and imperial environments. Its location and dependent territory gave Europos a dynamic and self-generating potential to expand and develop into the important, wealthier, and more complex settlement it would become.

In 113 BC, the Parthian Empire conquered Dura-Europos, and held it, with one brief intermission, until 165 AD, when it was taken by the Romans. The Parthian period was that of expansion at Dura-Europos, an expansion that was facilitated by the town&#x27;s losing its function as a military outpost. All the space enclosed by the walls gradually became occupied, and the influx of new inhabitants with Semitic and Iranian names alongside descendants of the original Macedonian colonists contributed to an increase in the population, which was a multicultural one, as inscriptions in Greek, Latin, Hebrew, various Aramaic dialects (Hatran, Palmyrene, Syriac), Middle Persian, Parthian, and Safaitic testify. In the 1st century BC, it served as a frontier fortress of the Parthian Empire.

=== Rebuilding of the city ===

The entirely original architecture of Dura-Europos was perfected during the Parthian period. This period was characterized by a progressive evolution of Greek concepts toward new formulas in which regional traditions, particularly Babylonian ones, played an increasing role. These innovations affected both religious and domestic buildings. Although Iranian influence is difficult to find in the architecture of Dura-Europos, in figurative art the influence of Parthian art is felt.

In 114 AD, the Emperor Trajan occupied the city for a couple of years: the Third Cyrenaica legion erected a &quot;Triumphal Arch&quot; west of the Palmyrene Gate. Upon the death of Trajan in 117, Rome relinquished Mesopotamia to the Parthians, but Dura was retaken by the Roman army of Lucius Verus during the Roman–Parthian War of 161–166.

The townspeople, however, retained considerable freedom as inhabitants of the regional headquarters for the section of the river between the Khabur River and modern Abu Kamal. The historian Ross Burns states that, in exchange, the city&#x27;s military role was abandoned. Its original Greek settler population was increasingly outnumbered by people of Semitic stock; and by the first century BC, the city was predominantly eastern in character.

The city regained its importance as a military outpost, when the Romans established it as a starting point for the conquest of the territories of Osroene, and as an outpost for expeditions against the Parthian empire and their capital on the Tigris in 198 AD. The city was later a border post of the Roman &quot;Kingdom of Palmyra&quot;.

The military importance of the site was confirmed after 209 AD: the northern part of the site was occupied by a Roman camp, isolated by a brick wall; soldiers were housed among civilians, among others, in the so-called &quot;House of Scribes&quot;. Romans built the palace of the commander of the military region on the edge of a cliff. The city then had several sanctuaries, beside the temples, dedicated to the Greek gods Zeus and Artemis. There were shrines, dating from the 1st century AD, dedicated to Mithra, to Palmyrene gods, and to local deities.

In 216 AD, a small amphitheater for soldiers was built in the military area, while the new synagogue, completed in 244 AD, and a house of Christian worship, were embellished with frescos of important characters wearing Roman tunics, caftans, and Parthian trousers. These splendid paintings, which cover the walls, testify to the richness of the Jewish and Christian communities. The population of Dura-Europos is estimated at 10,000-15,000 people, at the most; more conservative estimates say that the agriculture of that region could only support a population of about 5,000-6,000 people.

The city received the status of &quot;colonia&quot; after the year 254 AD; official documents called the city &quot;the &#x27;colony of the Europeans of Seleukos Nikator&#x27; (κωλονεία Εὐροπαίων Σελεύκου Νεικάτορος).&quot;

The good state of preservation of these buildings and their frescoes was due to their location, close to the main city wall facing west, and to the military necessity of strengthening the wall. The Sassanid Persians had become adept at tunneling under such walls in order to undermine them and create breaches. As a countermeasure, the Roman garrison decided to sacrifice the street and the buildings along the wall by filling them with rubble, to bolster the wall in case of a Persian mining operation. So, the Christian chapel, the synagogue, the Mithraeum, and many other buildings were entombed. The Romans also buttressed the walls from the outside with an earthen mound forming a glacis, sealed with a casing of mud brick to prevent erosion. As J.A. Baird writes, &quot;the threat by the Sasanians was keenly felt by the Roman military, and what had been a walled city became a fortress—literally, in that it became a defensive place. A huge embankment was built against the interior of the city walls to hold back the Sasanian incursion, deliberately and with great effort involving the methodical destruction of buildings and the moving of many metric tonnes of earth, ruining a huge swathe of the site&quot;.

=== Siege and destruction ===
There is no written record of the Sasanian siege of Dura. However, archaeologists have uncovered striking evidence of the siege and how it progressed.

The buttressing of the walls would be tested in 256 AD when Shapur I besieged the city. True to the fears of the defenders, Shapur set his engineers to undermine what archaeologists called Tower 19, two towers north of the Palmyrene Gate. When the Romans became aware of the threat, they dug a countermine with the aim of meeting the Persian effort and attacking them before they could finish their work. The Persians had already dug complex galleries along the wall by the time the Roman countermine reached them. They managed to fight off the Roman attack, and when the city defenders noticed the flight of soldiers from the countermine, it was quickly sealed. The wounded and stragglers were trapped inside, where they died. (It was the coins found with these Roman soldiers that dated the siege to AD 256.) The countermine was successful, for the Persians abandoned their operations at Tower 19.

Next, the Sassanids attacked Tower 14, the southernmost along the western wall. It overlooked a deep ravine to the south and it was from that direction that it was attacked. This time the mining operation was partially successful, in that it caused the tower and adjacent walls to subside. However, Roman countermeasure bolstered the wall and prevented it from collapsing.

This brought on a third attempt at breaching the city wall. A ramp was raised, attacking Tower 14; but, as it was being built and the garrison fought to stop the progress of the ramp, another mine was started near the ramp. Its purpose was not to cause a collapse of the wall — the buttress had been successful — but to pass under it and penetrate the city. This tunnel was built to allow the Persians four abreast to move through it. It eventually pierced the inner embankment and, when the ramp was completed, Dura&#x27;s end had come. As Persian troops charged up the ramp, their counterparts in the tunnel would have invaded the city with little opposition, as nearly all the defenders would have been on the wall, attempting to repel the attack from the ramp. The city was then abandoned, its population deported.

The siege was notable for the early use of chemical weapons by the attacking Persian army. During the siege the attackers dug several underground shaft mines under the city walls. The Romans dug tunnels to reach the mines and fight the diggers underground. In one such tunnel, when the Romans broke through into the Sassanian tunnel, the tunnelers ignited a mixture of sulfur and pitch, producing a cloud of poisonous gas, sulfur dioxide, which killed 19 Romans and 1 Persian, one of which was carrying a coin dated 256, allowing the dating of the siege. Archaeologists excavated the scene in the 1930s. In 2009, tests showed the presence of sulfur dioxide inside the tunnel. An archaeologist at the University of Leicester suggested that bitumen and sulphur crystals were ignited to create poisonous gas, which was then funnelled through the tunnel with the use of underground chimneys and bellows. The Roman soldiers had been constructing a countermine, and Sasanian forces are believed to have released the gas when their mine was breached by the Roman countermine. The lone Persian soldier discovered among the bodies is believed to be the individual responsible for releasing the gas before the fumes overcame him as well.

Shapur I destroyed not only Dura-Europos, but also other Palmyrene trade colonies along the Euphrates, including the colony at Anah, in 253. The sixth-century historian Peter the Patrician wrote that Odaenathus approached Shapur I to negotiate Palmyrene interests but was rebuffed and the gifts sent to the Persians were thrown into the river. The date for the attempted negotiations is debated: some scholars, including John F. Drinkwater, set the event in 253; while others, such as Alaric Watson, set it in 256, following the destruction of Dura-Europos.

=== After the siege ===
Clark Hopkins, the field director at Dura-Europos in the 1930s, opened his book &quot;The Discovery of Dura-Europos&quot; with an epigram:

After the siege and victory by the Persians in AD 256, the record is blank. The mute testimony that remained was of a site desolate and forlorn, where the lonely and level sands covered the bones of the city and stretched away across the desert.

Some evidence of a Sasanian presence at Dura after the sack of the city was found, but is limited to several coins, and some burials. Many buildings apparently stood empty for a time before they collapsed: a house in a part of the site near the river that was excavated by the Franco-Syrian expedition in the 2000s had its floors covered in disarticulated rodent skeletons and owl pellets, apparently from time when birds inhabited the emptied homes. Coin hoards were found, which indicate that people hoped to return to the city.

Historians argue whether Dura-Europos was completely abandoned after the siege of 256. Lucinda Dirven wrote that, according to Ammianus Marcellinus, Dura-Europos was a deserted town when Julian&#x27;s army passed there in 363. There is evidence from a Syriac document called &quot;Life of the Martyr Mu&#x27;Ain&quot;, dating from the fifth century, that a Christian (perhaps Byzantine) hermit lived there during the time of the Sassanid emperor Shapur II (c. 379). J. M. Unvala wrote that &quot;The fortress of Doura-Eropos is mentioned by ancient authors like Polybius, Isidore of Kharax, Lucian, Ptolemaeus, Ammianus Marcellinus, Zosimus the Cosmographer of Ravenna. It is also mentioned in the Acts of the Syrian Martyr Mar Mu&#x27;ain, who lived in the time of Shapur II as follows: &quot;men madabra da doura&quot; &quot;from the fortress of Doura&quot;; &quot;madinta hada xarabta metkaria doura&quot; &quot;the ruined city called Doura&quot;. Sebastian P. Brock describes the story of Mu&#x27;Ain as &quot;The &quot;History of Ma&#x27;in of Sinjar&quot;, a general under Shapur II (309–79) who converted to Christianity and suffered as a confessor&quot;. He quotes Jean Maurice Fiey regarding the dating and place, and notes that &quot;Dura is specifically described as being &#x27;ruined&#x27;&quot;:

Fiey is more plausible in his suggestion that the &quot;History&quot; was written at a monastery that had grown up on the site of Mar Ma&#x27;in&#x27;s cell at Shadba (=Shadwa, Shadbo), 6 miles from Europos, and on the basis of this he is able to give c. 636, the end of Byzantine rule in that area, as the &quot;terminus ante quem&quot;, since the author is clearly writing at a time when the Byzantine emperor controlled the area.

Another piece of evidence is a single coin, of the Roman emperor Constantius II, that indicates some activity in the 4th century or later. A Yale–French expedition also found seven lamps dating from fifth century. Because of these finds, historians concluded that the city wasn&#x27;t abandoned and that there is &quot;firm evidence that not only did activity continue at Dura—even if it was only sporadic and cannot confidently be associated with permanent settlement—but that contact with the Mediterranean, though certainly even more sporadic, continued as well.&quot;

== Inhabitants, languages and texts ==
Dura-Europos was a cosmopolitan society, ruled by a tolerant Macedonian aristocracy descended from the original settlers. In the course of its excavation, over a hundred parchment and papyrus fragments, and many inscriptions, have revealed texts in Greek and Latin (the latter including a sator square), Palmyrene, Hebrew, Hatrian, Safaitic (proto-Arabic dialect), Pahlavi, Parthian, and Middle-Persian. In such a multicultural city, languages used by people didn&#x27;t tell of their ethnicity.

Dura-Europos was founded by Greek settlers. So, it is not surprising that the vast majority of the inscriptions are in Greek, and about 800 Greek texts are known so far. These are dedicatory inscriptions, graffiti, and documents on papyrus and parchment. Greek was primarily the language of business and seems to have gained in importance, especially after the Roman occupation. It is believed that the upper class of the city, in particular, was still Greek in Parthian times. Palmyric is known, with certainty, from various inscriptions on monuments from 33 BC. It is believed that a small number of Palmyric traders lived in the city, and in Roman times there were also soldiers from Palmyra. Parthian is not well attested to, and the few Parthian inscriptions seem to date to Roman times. Middle Persian is attested primarily by two parchments and numerous graffiti in the synagogue. The texts must date from the short time when the city was ruled by the Sasanids.

Historian George Kilpatrick described the linguistic diversity as follows (from examples of graffiti from the synagogue):

Apart from a liturgical text written in Hebrew (on a parchment), the available textual sources from the synagogue consist of inscriptions and graffiti, which are more or less evenly divided in Aramaic (22), Greek (19) and Persian (12 Middle Persian, &#x27;Pārsīk&#x27;, and 3 Parthian, &#x27;Pahlavīk&#x27;). [...] Most of the Persian ones were written on the wall paintings themselves and record appraisal on the part of visitors from elsewhere. Their presence can be explained by assuming that Mesopotamian Jews had sent someone &quot;like a consular representative nowadays&quot; to the Euphrates stronghold, in order to approve of the frescos.

Because of the dry desert climate, numerous documents on papyrus and parchment have been preserved, materials that otherwise would have little chance of surviving for millennia. The documents were found under the brick ramp built against the western wall, where they were especially protected. In the Temple of Artemis Azzanathkona, documents of the Cohors XX Palmyrenorum, which was stationed here, were found in a room that apparently served as an archive. The texts offer a unique view of the organization of the Roman army on the eastern border of the empire, and include a religious festival calendar, various letters—some of which are in Latin—daily reports on troop movements, and various lists of names.

Although the documents found mainly regard administration (in Latin) and business (in Greek), some literary and religious texts were found in the city. Only a few documents can be dated with certainty to the time of Parthian rule. Only seven of them are definitely dated. They are written in Greek but use the Seleucid calendar. Among the literary texts there is a fragment by Herodotus and one by Appian. The Herodotus fragment comes from his 5th book and is written in extremely beautiful script. C. Bradford Welles describes the book as &quot;de luxe&quot; and dates the copy to the 2nd century AD. Dura parchment 10 (P. Dura 10), the fragment of a harmony of the Gospels, is particularly interesting. It is perhaps a fragment of Tatian&#x27;s &quot;Diatessaron&quot;. There was also a prayer in Hebrew. The texts shed light on daily life in the city. In Parthian times, documents were dated from the Arsacian era and from the Seleucid era. Interesting is the appearance of women in the legal documents of the Parthian and Roman periods, which indicated that they acted independently and did not need a male advocate, as they did in the Mediterranean region.

Many Greek documents are in the Attic dialect and have few grammatical errors. Since most of the texts are legal documents, this shows that most of the writers were well educated in the Greek language. On the other hand, a letter dating from the third century that was sent by a person from the village of Ossa shows more deviations from the classic Attic. Still, there is no indication that any dialect of Greek peculiar to the city, a &quot;Durene&quot; dialect, developed.

The languages used by different people show how multicultural the city was. For example, on a ceiling tile of Heliodoros, an actuarius (an official responsible for the distribution of wages in the Roman military), there is a Greek inscription that identifies the man by name and occupation. The use of Greek to identify a Roman official is typical of the multicultural environment at Dura-Europos. Another example is an inscription that reads: &quot;... brave in campaigns, mighty in wars, dead...&quot; These words are part of the epitaph of Julius Terentius, tribune of the twentieth Palmyrene cohort. As historian Jennifer Baird wrote, Julius is known better than most of the Roman soldiers who were stationed at Dura, as he is recorded in papyri from the military archives as well as from a painting, depicting him with his men. His Greek funerary inscription was found in a house near the centre of the city, apparently incomplete—as can be seen, the last section was not carved, but the painted guiding lines are preserved. Whether his wife, Aurelia Arria, or the person she commissioned to create this, did not themselves survive to complete the memorial, we do not know. While it is incomplete, this shows a Roman tribune commemorated with a Greek inscription by his wife. Also, it is virtually unique at Dura, where no tradition of funerary commemoration was found: no funerary inscriptions, and, unlike its more famous Syrian neighbour Palmyra, no funerary portraits. One more interesting example is an altar of the local god Yarhibol. On it there is an inscription in Greek: &quot;[For] the god Yarhibol, Scribonius Moucianus, chiliarch, made this as commanded.&quot; It is notable because it shows that a man who bears a Latin name, Scribonius Moucianus, and holding a Greek-titled office in the Roman army, worshipped a local deity and offered his dedication in Greek.

Some documents that were found are evidence of a local tradition of people having several names: for example, a Greek one and a Semitic or a Persian one. One of the examples is &quot;Dura parchment 19&quot; (P. Dura 19) (dating from first century AD), which records the division of a house inherited by four brothers from their father. As Baird wrote:

The father is recorded as having the Greek name Polemocrates (his own father and grandfather also bearing the names Demetrius and Polemocrates, respectively), and amongst the younger Polemocrates&#x27; sons, all had both Greek and Aramaic names, for instance Demetrius, also known as Nabusamus. The document records the concern with noting patrilineal descent – descent along the male line – and a pattern of sons taking the Greek name of their grandfathers. They are described as Europaioi, &#x27;of Europos&#x27;, a designation of place which [...] is generally assumed to indicate citizen status.

Fragments of parchment scrolls with Hebrew texts have also been unearthed; they resisted meaningful translation until J.L. Teicher pointed out that they were Christian Eucharistic prayers, so closely connected with the prayers in &quot;Didache&quot; that he was able to fill lacunae in the light of the &quot;Didache&quot; text.

In 1933, among fragments of text recovered from the town dump outside the Palmyrene Gate, a fragmentary text was unearthed from an unknown &quot;Greek harmony of the gospel&quot; account—comparable to Tatian&#x27;s &quot;Diatessaron&quot;, but independent of it.

== Religious life ==
John Noble Wilford compared the ancient city with modern New York:

New Yorkers would have felt at home in the grid pattern of streets, where merchants lived, scribes wrote and Jews worshiped in the same block, not far from a Christian house-church as well as shrines to Greek and Palmyrene deities. Scholars said the different religious groups seemed to maintain their distinct identities.

=== Greco-Roman, Palmyrene, and local cults ===
The Temple of Artemis Nanaïa was perhaps the oldest temple in the city. In the Seleucid period there was a temenos (a walled, sacred area) with a Doric colonnade and an altar in the middle. At the end of the second century BC it burned down. A naiskos (small temple) was built in its stead, but it was never finished. In the middle of the first century BC the temple was rebuilt: a courtyard complex was created, in the middle of which stood a new temple, with an anteroom and three-aisled cella. The temple was rebuilt several times before the city fell. A statue, found in its ruins, represents a woman&#x27;s figure, probably Artemis, dressed in hunting garb. Only the upper part was found, both arms having been broken off. Historian Susan B. Downey writes that the statue has &quot;an Amazonian aspect by the fact that one breast is left bare&quot;. There is a crescent-shaped necklace on the statue, and a veil of unusual form.

There were at least three Palmyric temples in the city. The Temple of Bel (also known as the Temple of the Palmyric Gods) was built in one corner of the city wall, in the third century BC. Several construction phases can be distinguished in the building. The plan consisted of various rooms ranged around a courtyard; the actual temple stood to the north and was later marked by four columns. This temple was once richly decorated with wall paintings. There was also a shrine here, which probably contained the cult image. A small sanctuary of Bel, consisted of a single hall, was also found.

The Necropolis Temple was built in 33 BC and, according to the inscriptions, was dedicated to Baal and Yarhibol. The temple was just outside the city and probably was maintained until the city&#x27;s abandonment. Although the temple was located in the city&#x27;s necropolis, it was built prior; and the cult there had no connection to the cemetery. The temple could have been a first port of call for caravans coming from Palmyra. A cistern next to the temple may have served to water pack animals. Remains of wall paintings were found in the temple. Three inscriptions are particularly important. The oldest of them, written in Palmyric, dates from 33 BC (year 279 of the Seleucid era) It is the oldest known inscription at Dura-Europos; and when it was found and published in 1935, it was the oldest known Palmyric inscription anywhere. The names of the founders of the temple are known: Zabdibol, son of Ba&#x27;yashu, and Maliku, son of Ramu. Zabdibol came from the Bene Gaddibol clan, Maliku from that of the Bene Komare. The donors were obviously Palmyrians who lived in Dura-Europos. It is noteworthy that the donors come from two different clans. In inscriptions at Palmyra, when different donors are named together, they come from the same clan. The Bene Gaddibol clan is well documented in Palmyra, where belonging to a clan was an important part of one&#x27;s identity. In Dura-Europos clan membership obviously lost its meaning, and two people from different clans could appear together in inscriptions. In Dura-Europos, their identity was their common Palmyrene origin.


The Temple of Atargatis, which is south of the centre of the city (referred to by the excavators as the agora) and which occupies the northern part of H2 Block, was built on roughly the same principle. The temple complex had a large courtyard in the middle, a monumental entrance, and a sanctuary with a pronaos (portico) in front and three naoi (chambers) at the back. There were numerous small rooms around the courtyard, some of which were probably shrines that were consecrated to various deities. A relief on the sanctuary of the temple shows the goddess Atargatis, with a lion on either side of her, and her husband Hadad nearby. A cult standard is depicted between the two deities. Atargatis was the mother of Adonis; Hadad and Adonis could also be worshipped here. Various inscriptions by ancient visitors tell of the people who visited the sanctuary. That the temple was frequented by people from Hatra is shown by a visitor&#x27;s inscription, in Hatran (an Aramaic language), that is addressed to the god of the city of Hatra named Šamaš. Otherwise, a striking number of inscriptions in the temple, some of which were scratched into the walls, were made by women. There is an inscription from the first half of the first century AD that mentions the consecration of a chapel. A number of other inscriptions date from 69 AD. Some of the women named in the inscriptions appear to have come from the family of the governors of Dura-Europos. One woman was the granddaughter of the governor Lysias, another woman the wife of the governor Seleucus. In a wall of the temple there was a cuneiform tablet with old Babylonian script, which names the place as &quot;Da-wa-ra&quot;, which may be an old name for Dura.

In the southeast part of the site, which was separated from the rest of the city by a wadi, apparently stood an acropolis typical of a Greek city. However, hardly anything has survived from the temples of that time.

The Temple of Zeus Theos was built in the second century AD and was among the most important sanctuaries of the city. The building was in the centre of the city. It had an area of around and occupied half an insula. The building had a monumental courtyard and in it a large naos. The cult figure of the god was depicted on the back wall. He stood next to a chariot and was crowned by two Nikes. On the side walls of the hall are the pictures of the donors, and their family members, who financed this temple.

The Temple of the Gadde was a double temple dedicated to the patron deities (&quot;gaddē&quot;) of the city and of Palmyra. The building is located near the agora. The temple was built in the last years of Parthian rule. A propylaeon (monumental gateway) led into a courtyard; opposite the gateway was the cella with other rooms. On the right side, a hall with benches on the walls led to another courtyard, with another cella there. The exact age of the temple complex is unknown. It was expanded several times over time. Two consecration reliefs were found in the temple. One of them shows the female protective deity of Palmyra in a guise modelled on the Tyche of Antioch. She sits between two figures, wearing a mural crown and Greek clothing. On her left is the dedicator of the relief, depicted as a priest, and on her right a Nike. The other depicts the male patron deity of Dura-Europos, bearded and wearing a tunic. It is very likely a depiction of Zeus Megistos. To his right is Seleukos Nikator, on the left is the one consecrating the relief. The city was founded by Seleukos Nikator, so the ruler enjoyed a special veneration here. According to an inscription, the reliefs were dedicated to &quot;The god, Gad of Dura; made by Hairan bar Maliku Nasor, in the month of Nisan, year 470 [159 AD].&quot; The cella also contained a relief that depicted the Semitic god Yarhibol. An inscription records &quot;Bani Mitha, the archers&quot; as the donors.

The Temple of Adonis was also built in Parthian times. It is also a temple complex that is grouped around a courtyard. The actual temple was located to the south and consisted of a pronaos and the naos. Wall paintings, which were discovered in a fragmentary state, depicted a statue and a family making an offering to the god on a fire altar at left. The scene has been reconstructed. In the temple complex there was also another relief, which shows the god Arsu on a camel. The inscription under the figure reads: &quot;Oga the sculptor has made (this to) &#x27;Arsu the camel-rider&#x27;, for the life of his son&quot;.

The Temple of Artemis Azzanathkona was on the north side of the city and had two naoi. The temple has stood here since at least 13 AD. In Roman times, the complex was partly integrated into the military camp, although the cult worship was continued. The archive of the Cohors XX Palmyrenorum was found in one room of the temple. An inscription from 161 AD said that the temple was dedicated to Artemis Azzanathkona. Her followers believed in a &quot;syncretized combination&quot; of a Greek goddess Artemis and local Syrian deity Azzanathkona (Atargatis).

The Dolicheneum was a temple where Jupiter Dolichenus and the god called Zeus Helios Mithras Turmasgade may have been worshiped. The temple entrance was in the south part. The building had a columned courtyard with two altars; behind it were two cellae. The temple was therefore dedicated to two deities. Various rooms were arranged around the courtyard, some of them had benches along the walls. Remnants of wall paintings were also found in one room. Various inscriptions were discovered in and around the temple. One cella was dedicated to the little-known god Turmasgade. The second cella was for Jupiter Dolichenus, several dedications to whom were found in the temple. Another room was dedicated to an unnamed goddess, probably Juno Dolichena. The temple was built by units of the Roman army around 211 AD, and was in use until 256 AD, mainly by Roman soldiers stationed in the city. Soldiers left several inscriptions that mention &quot;&quot;centurio princeps&quot; of a vexillation of IV (Scythia) and XVI Flavia Firma, a vexillation of Cohors II Paphlagonum with the titles &#x27;Galliana Volusiana&#x27;, a &quot;cohors equitata&quot; with the same titles, and Julius Julianus, of A.D. 251&quot;.

The Temple of Zeus Megistos (second century AD) on the Acropolis probably replaced a Greek temple of Zeus Olympius. The assignment of the temple to Zeus Megistos is based only on a dedicatory inscription, according to which parts of the building were made by Seleucus, Strategos (&quot;strategos kai epistates&quot;) of the city, rebuilt and consecrated to the god. The inscription dates to 169/170 AD and tells of numerous construction works on the temple, perhaps after it was destroyed by an earthquake. Probably then the building received its final form. The founder, Seleukos, was practically a governor in Dura-Europos and belonged to a Greek family who held this office for several generations. The governor&#x27;s family&#x27;s house was right next to the temple. Other members of the governor&#x27;s family, such as Lysias, are also mentioned in inscriptions, but no titles are mentioned, so there is a possibility that these are other people of the same name who did not belong to the governor&#x27;s family.

The Temple of Zeus Kyrios was a small sanctuary built against the city wall. A stele was found in the sanctuary, with either a cult image or a dedicatory relief on it. The stele shows Zeus seated on the right and a donor who appears to be a Palmyrene man. The stele has a Palmyrene language inscription that states that it was erected by Baratheh, son of Luke and his son Abubuhi in 31 AD. The god is named as Baalshamin. A Greek inscription also gives the name of the donor as Seleukos, son of Luke, and names the god as Zeus. A further Greek inscription on the stele again names Seleukos, gives the date, and refers to the god as Zeus Kyrios.

Multiple images of Greco-Roman deities were also found. Among them are Nemesis, Nike, and Aphrodite. One of the reliefs of Aphrodite was found in a private house, and is one of three such reliefs that were made in the same mold. The composition is derived from Hellenistic art, but the goddess&#x27;s attributes—her bracelets, anklets, breast ornaments, and lack of modesty—is similar to the images of nude Near Eastern fertility goddesses. Perhaps it can explain her popularity at Dura-Europos. The relief is dated to 200-256 AD. The house where the relief was found is close to the military quarter and may have been a brothel. Two other nearly identical and one fragmentary versions of this relief were excavated across the site. One of the additional Aphrodite reliefs was found at what is called the House of Priests, which led to speculation about women&#x27;s roles in the domestic cult. A marble statue of Aphrodite Urania was found in the Temple of Artemis; it is thought to have been imported to Dura-Europos. Wall paintings of Aphrodite and Cupid were found in the House of Scribes.

A relief of the goddess Nemesis was described as: &quot;Marble relief of the goddess Nemesis (right) receiving a burnt offering by a priest named Julius Aurelius Malochus. The relief includes a &#x27;floating&#x27; bust with a radiant aura around the bust. One interpretation is that the bust symbolizes the cosmic power of the goddess. At the feet of the goddess is a wheel (a typical symbol associated with the goddess) and a griffin.&quot; As noted by Dirven, the image of Nemesis here differs from those in Palmyra and Greece. Here she is associated with a sun god; in Palmyra she was most likely associated with the goddess Allat, who was worshipped in sanctuaries together with the sun god Shamash. Dirven concludes that &quot;the popularity of solar deities among the military probably enforced this Palmyrene association of Nemesis-Allat with the sun god and resulted in the presence of the sun god in the Durene relief&quot;.

The dedication reads:

&lt;poem class=center&gt;
Θεᾷ Νεμέσι Ιούλιος Αὐρήλιος Μαλωχὰς
Σουδαίου Παλμυρηνὸς εὐξάμενος ἀνέθηκεν 
Translation: Julius Aurelius Malochas, son of Soudaios, Palmyrene, set this up in gratitude to the goddess Nemesis.

‘bd wmwd’ mlwk’ br šwdy tdmry’ lnmsys šnt 556 
Translation: Maloka son of Shudai, Palmyrene, made (this), and with gratitude, for Nemesis. The year 556 (AD 244-5).
&lt;/poem&gt;

The goddess of victory, Nike, was also popular in Dura-Europos, especially with the military, who viewed her as &quot;an active divine force influencing human affairs and bringing military success. One of the paintings of Nike was found in an enclosed wooden shrine in the Palmyrene Gate. That painting may have contained a depiction of the emperor. It was dedicated to the goddess by soldiers on behalf of their commander and his family.

=== Synagogue ===

The Jewish synagogue, located by the western wall between towers 18 and 19, the last phase of which was dated by an Aramaic inscription to 244, is the best preserved of the many ancient synagogues of that era that have been uncovered by archaeologists. It was well preserved due to having been infilled with earth to strengthen the city&#x27;s fortifications against a Sasanian assault in 256. It was uncovered in 1932 by Clark Hopkins, who found that it contains a forecourt and house of assembly with frescoed walls depicting people and animals, and a Torah shrine in the western wall facing Jerusalem.
The discovery of the wall paintings in the assembly hall of the synagogue caused a tremendous sensation, as it is the largest cycle of paintings that has survived from antiquity. The find is important for religious history, as the Jewish communities there were generally judged to be hostile to images. The paintings are preserved at Damascus.

=== House church ===

The Dura-Europos house church, the earliest house church yet discovered, is near the 17th tower and was preserved by the same defensive fill that saved the synagogue. &quot;Their evidently open and tolerated presence in the middle of a major Roman garrison town reveals that the history of the early Church was not simply a story of pagan persecution&quot;.

The building consists of a house conjoined to a separate hall-like room, which functioned as the meeting room for the church. Dating from 235 AD, the surviving frescoes of the baptistry room are probably the most ancient Christian paintings in existence. The &quot;Good Shepherd&quot;, the &quot;Healing of the paralytic&quot;, and &quot;Christ and Peter walking on the water&quot; are among the preserved paintings and are the earliest depictions of Jesus Christ ever found.

A much larger fresco depicts two women (and a third, mostly lost) approaching a large sarcophagus, i.e. probably the three Marys visiting Christ&#x27;s tomb. There are also frescoes of Adam and Eve as well as David and Goliath. The frescoes clearly followed the Hellenistic Jewish iconographic tradition, but they are more crudely done than the paintings of the nearby synagogue.

=== Mithraeum ===


Also partially preserved by the defensive embankment, was the Mithraeum, between towers 23 and 24. It was unearthed in January 1934 after years of expectation as to whether Dura would reveal traces of the Roman Mithraic cult. The earliest archaeological traces found within the temple are from between 168 and 171 AD, which coincides with the arrival of Lucius Verus and his troops. At this stage it was still a room in a private home. It was extended and renovated between 209 and 211, and most of the frescoes are from this period. The &quot;tabula ansata&quot; of 210 offers salutation to Septimus Severus, Caracalla, and Geta. The construction was managed by a &quot;centurio principe praepositus&quot; of the Legio IIII Scythica and the Legio XVI Flavia Firma, and it seems that construction was done by imperial troops. The mithraeum was enlarged again in 240, but in 256—with war with Sasanians looming—the sanctuary was filled in and became part of the strengthened fortifications. Following excavations, the temple was transported in pieces to New Haven, Connecticut, where it was rebuilt (and is now on display) at the Yale University Art Gallery.

The surviving frescoes, graffiti, and dipinti (painted inscriptions, which number in the dozens) are of enormous interest in the study of the social composition of the cult. The statuary and altars were found intact, as was the typical relief of Mithras slaying the bull, with the hero-god dressed, as usual, in &quot;oriental&quot; costume (&quot;trousers, boots, and pointed cap&quot;). As is typical for mithraea in the Roman provinces in the Greek East, the inscriptions and graffiti are mostly in Greek, with the rest in Palmyrene (and some in Hellenized Hebrew). The end of the sanctuary features an arch with a seated figure on each of the two supporting columns. Inside, and following the form of the arch, is a series of depictions of the zodiac. Within the framework of the now-obsolete theory that the Roman cult was &quot;a Roman form of Mazdaism&quot; (&quot;la forme romaine du mazdeisme&quot;), Cumont supposed that the two Dura friezes represented the two primary figures of his &quot;Les Mages hellénisés&quot;, i.e. Zoroaster and Ostanes. This reading has not found favor with others: &quot;the two figures are Palmyrene in all their characteristic traits&quot; and are more probably portraits of leading members of that mithraeum&#x27;s congregation of Syrian auxiliaries.

== Archaeology ==
=== Overview ===
The existence of Dura-Europos was long known through literary sources. Its actual location was rediscovered by the American &quot;Wolfe Expedition&quot; in 1885, when the Palmyrene Gate was photographed by John Henry Haynes.

British troops under Captain Murphy, in the aftermath of World War I and the Arab Revolt, also explored the ruins. On March 30, 1920, a soldier digging a trench uncovered brilliantly fresh wall-paintings in the Temple of Bel. The American archeologist James Henry Breasted, then at Baghdad, was alerted. Major excavations were carried out in the 1920s and 1930s by French and American teams. The first archaeology on the site, undertaken by Franz Cumont and published in 1922–23, identified the site with Dura-Europos, and uncovered a temple, before renewed hostilities in the area closed it to archaeology. Later, renewed campaigns directed by Clark Hopkins and Michael Rostovtzeff continued until 1937, when funds ran out, with only part of the excavations published.

In 1986 excavations resumed in a joint Franco-Syrian effort under the direction of Pierre Leriche. Fifteen years of excavations led to a revival of issues on the Hellenistic levels (P. Leriche) and on the history of the city thanks to studies on the fortifications (J.-C. Bessac 1997) and stone architecture (J. Abdul Massih 2000) and mud brick (M. Gelin 2000). The mission also resumed the study of certain formerly excavated monuments, such as the odeon, the palace of the Strategos, the temples of Zeus Megistos, Bel and Azanathkona, the houses of islets C7 and D1.

=== Archaeological site ===

The site is divided between a flat part of 45 ha, delimited by the line of the western rampart and the irregular layout of the northern and southern wadis, a narrow part culminating at an altitude of 218 m, crowned by the walls of the citadel, and a lower part 20 m below the top of the plateau. This depression is the meeting of two ravines: the first begins in the northeast of the site and runs along the western limit of the citadel, before joining the east–west ravine incised in the center of the plateau. The current shape of this interior wadi is the result of natural erosion but also of considerable exploitation as a stone quarry, as shown by the faces of cuts erected under the edge of the plateau to the west. The site also suffered from earthquakes, recurring since the antiquity, which caused the collapse of the eastern part of the citadel and the south-eastern quarter of the site. The enclosure, entirely cleared by the Yale excavators, is preserved in elevation, except for a few segments of the north and south ramparts.

=== Palace of the Strategos ===

The Palace of the Strategos is organized around a central courtyard, 11 x 11.50 m, framed by a corridor on each side. Porticoes with two columns highlight the official rooms: the large vestibule at the entrance to the west and to the south, the reception room. To the north and west, corridors control access to more functional rooms. In a first phase, the courtyard covered a space a little further south with three rooms to the north, the walls of which were subsequently leveled and found in the north corridor laid out in a second phase, when the palace was extended to the north. A new facade was then built projecting onto the southern slope of the inner wadi. This extension resulted in the addition of the U corridor, along the courtyard, and three new rooms at the back of the bossed facade. The oldest floor, found in the northwest room, contained a coin of Antiochos III, which fixes around 200 BC. Dating of the first state could not be attested by the too eroded material; in relative chronology, it is dated to the course of the 3rd century.

=== Archaeological finds ===
Among the archaeological finds were astonishingly well-preserved arms and armour belonging to the Roman garrison at the time of the final Sasanian siege of 256 AD, which included painted wooden shields and complete horse armour, preserved by the very finality of the destruction of the city that journalists have called &quot;the Pompeii of the desert&quot;. Finds from Dura-Europos are on display in the Deir ez-Zor Museum and the Yale University Art Gallery.

Two sets of horse armor were found at the site. As the historian Lisa Brody wrote, &quot;[t]he discovery singularly transformed historians&#x27; understanding of Roman cavalry equipment.&quot; These are the only full sets of scale horse armor ever found. Each set of armor was made of nearly 2000 individual overlapping thin, scale-like plates bound together with wire. Such armor was used by Parthians, Sasanians, and later by Roman heavy cavalry. Archaeologist Simon James wrote about the discovery of the scale armor in Tower 19. Since Tower 19 was partially destroyed during a siege, sediment settled on the items inside the tower, which ended up preserving them well, allowing the armor to be incredibly intact.

A painted semi-cylindrical scutum was also found at the site; it is the only one ever found. The shield was found during the excavation campaign of 1928–1937 at Tower 19. The scutum is a rectangular arched shield that measures and is made mostly of wood. It was found broken into thirteen pieces. It is made from strips of wood that are wide and thick. They are put together in three layers, so that the total thickness of the wood layer is . In the center of the shield is a hole that was probably cut in the wood after the board was made; the &quot;umbo&quot; (central boss) is missing. The back of the shield should be provided with reinforcing strips of wood, but they weren&#x27;t found. There appears to have been red skin covering the back; it is mentioned in the preliminary report of the excavation that later was lost. The surface of the front was covered with fabric and then with skin or parchment, with a painting on it. There are several decorative ribbons around the central hole. Decorations include an eagle with a laurel wreath, winged Victories, and a lion.

Another important find was that of three painted wooden shields with scenes of the Trojan War as depicted in the Iliad. On Friday, January 18, 1935, Clark Hopkins, field director of excavations, wrote in his notes:

Just after breakfast, three painted shields were found one right a top of the other... Herb and I spent all morning removing them. Most of the wood was strong enough to move easily and much of the painting is visible.

Each of the three shields was decorated with a distinct multi-colored scene; one showed the battle between the Greeks and the Amazons; the so-called Homeric Shield showed the tale of the Trojan horse; and a third was decorated with a warrior god. Constructed of multiple thin slats of wood joined along the long edges and painted, the oval shields—all approximately high by wide—were cleaned in the field after excavation and consolidated with polyvinyl acetate by the expedition artist Herbert Gute. When the shields were brought to Yale University in 1935, conservator George Stout and scientist Rutherford Gettens, from the Harvard University Fogg Art Museum, analyzed them and produced a comprehensive report. Also at that time, Yale School of Forestry professor Samuel Record investigated the wood and identified it as pine. The shields became the subject of close re-examination in 2011. Based on that analysis the painted surface appears to include carbon black; calcium-based whites, including gypsum and chalk; lead white; orpiment; organic red (likely rose madder); vermilion; indigo; and red and yellow iron oxide pigments. As noted by associate conservator Irma Passeri from Yale, the shields are interesting and important examples of painted shields:

One of the more interesting aspects of the shield — one that relates it to later works such as medieval and renaissance paintings — are the preparatory and paint layers on the piece, in which we see the use of both organic and inorganic materials. It informs us how artists or artisans developed similar technologies and approaches throughout the centuries when creating works of art.

It was also noted by the examiners&#x27; team that &quot;the shield has an interesting combination of materials — some that are indigenous to Syria and others that would have been traded.&quot;

== Modern times ==

=== Recognition ===
* In 1999, Dura-Europos was included on the &quot;Tentative List&quot; of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. In 2011, was again included on that list, with the nearby ancient city of Mari.
* The jury of the International Carlo Scarpa Prize for Gardens unanimously decided that their 2010 award, the twenty-first of those annual awards, would go to Dura-Europos.

=== Looting by ISIS ===
Between 2011 and 2014, during the Syrian Civil War, Dura-Europos was looted and mostly destroyed by the Islamic State. In 2015, according to satellite imagery, more than 70% of Dura-Europos was destroyed by looters; and &quot;National Geographic&quot; reported further plundering of the site on a massive scale by the Islamic State in order to fund their hold on the region.

=== In popular culture ===
&quot;Fire in the East&quot; (2008), the first book in the &quot;Warrior of Rome&quot; series by the Oxford scholar Harry Sidebottom, is centred around a detailed description of the Sassanid siege of Dura-Europos in 256 AD, based on the archeological finds in the site, although the city name was changed to &quot;Arete.&quot;

&quot;The Parthian&quot; (2011) is the first novel in the Parthian Chronicles series by Peter Darman. These chronicles have, as their central fictional character, Pacorus I, King of Dura-Europos (although the royal name Pacorus features prominently during the Parthian Empire), who lived at the same time as the rebel Roman gladiator Spartacus and was part of Spartacus&#x27;s army before being freed in Italy and then returning home to Parthia, where he became the most feared warrior in the empire.

The first edition of Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;Murder in Mesopotamia&quot; of 1936 shows on its cover the view from the high escarpment at Dura. Christie, her husband Max Mallowan and Robin Halliday Macartney, who designed the cover, had visited Dura-Europos on 8 November 1934.

<text>The Hudson Motor Car Company made Hudson and other branded automobiles in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., from 1909 until 1954. In 1954, Hudson merged with Nash-Kelvinator to form American Motors Corporation (AMC). The Hudson name was continued through the 1957 model year, after which it was discontinued.

==Company strategy==

The name &quot;Hudson&quot; came from Joseph L. Hudson, a Detroit department store entrepreneur and founder of Hudson&#x27;s department store, who provided the necessary capital and gave permission for the company to be named after him. A total of eight Detroit businessmen formed the company on February 20, 1909, to produce an automobile which would sell for less than US$1,000 (equivalent to approximately $ in funds).

One of the lead &quot;car men&quot; and an organizer of the company was Roy D. Chapin Sr., a young executive who had worked with Ransom E. Olds. (Chapin&#x27;s son, Roy Jr., would later be president of Hudson-Nash descendant American Motors Corporation in the 1960s). The company quickly started production, with the first car driven out of a small factory in Detroit on July 3, 1909, at Mack Avenue and Beaufait Street on the East Side of Detroit, occupying the old Aerocar factory.

The new Hudson &quot;Twenty&quot; was one of the first low-priced cars on the American market and became successful with 4,508 sold the first year. This was the best first year&#x27;s production in the history of the automobile industry and put the newly formed company in 17th place industry-wide, &quot;a remarkable achievement at a time&quot; when there were hundreds of makes being marketed.

Successful sales volume required a larger factory. A new facility was built on a parcel at Jefferson Avenue and Conner Avenue in Detroit&#x27;s Fairview section that was diagonally across from the Chalmers Automobile plant. The land was the former farm of D.J. Campau. It was designed by the firm of renowned industrial architect Albert Kahn with 223,500 square feet and opened on October 29, 1910. Production in 1911 increased to 6,486. For 1914, Hudsons for the American market were now left-hand drive.

Coachbuilder Fisher Body Co. built bodies for Hudson cars (as well as many other automotive marques) until they were bought out by General Motors in 1919. From 1923, Hudson bodies were built exclusively by Massachusetts company Biddle and Smart. The lucrative contract with Hudson would see Biddle and Smart buy up many smaller local coachbuilders to meet the Hudson demand. Peak shipments came in 1926, when the company delivered 41,000 bodies to Hudson. An inability to stamp steel meant that their products were made using aluminum.

On 1 July 1926, Hudson&#x27;s new US$10 million ($ in dollars ) body plant was completed where the automaker could now build the all-steel closed bodies for both the Hudson and Essex models. Biddle and Smart continued to build aluminum body versions of the Hudson line and were marketed by Hudson as &quot;custom-built&quot; although they were the same as the steel-body vehicles. With Hudson now building in-house, Biddle and Smart saw their work for Hudson drop by 60%. From 1927 Hudson gradually began to utilize local coachbuilders Briggs Manufacturing Company and Murray Corporation of America to supplement Hudson&#x27;s production which was expanding domestically and internationally. With car prices falling due to the Great Depression and the costs to transport vehicles from Massachusetts to Detroit becoming too expensive, the contract with Biddle and Smart was terminated in 1930, and Biddle and Smart went out of business shortly thereafter.

At their peak in 1929, Hudson and Essex produced a combined 300,000 cars in one year, including contributions from Hudson&#x27;s other factories in Belgium and England; a factory had been built in 1925 in Brentford in London. Hudson was the third largest U.S. car maker that year, after Ford Motor Company and Chevrolet.

Hudson had many firsts for the auto industry; these included dual brakes, the use of dashboard oil-pressure and generator warning lights, and the first balanced crankshaft, which allowed the Hudson straight-six engine, dubbed the &quot;Super Six&quot; (1916), to work at a higher rotational speed while remaining smooth, developing more power for its size than lower-speed engines. The Super Six was the first engine built by Hudson, previously Hudson had developed engine designs and then had them manufactured by Continental Motors Company. Most Hudsons until 1957 had straight-6 engines. The dual brake system used a secondary mechanical emergency brake system, which activated the rear brakes when the pedal traveled beyond the normal reach of the primary system; a mechanical parking brake was also used. Hudson transmissions also used an oil bath and cork clutch mechanism that proved to be as durable as it was smooth.

==Essex and Terraplane==


In 1919, Hudson introduced the Essex brand line of automobiles; the line was originally for budget-minded buyers, designed to compete with Ford and Chevrolet, as opposed to the more up-scale Hudson line competing with Oldsmobile and Studebaker. Local coachbuilder Briggs Manufacturing introduced their first-of-its-kind closed coach body in 1922 for Hudson&#x27;s Essex. It was the first closed vehicle available at a price close to its open-bodied brethren. The 1922 Essex closed body was priced at only $300 more than the 1922 Essex touring. Within three years, its popularity enabled Hudson to reduce its price so that both the 1925 Essex touring and coach were priced the same. The Essex found great success by offering one of the first affordable sedans, and combined Hudson and Essex sales moved from seventh in the U.S. to third by 1925.

In 1932, Hudson began phasing out its Essex nameplate for the modern Terraplane brand name. The new line was launched on July 21, 1932, with a promotional christening by Amelia Earhart. For 1932 and 1933, the restyled cars were named Essex-Terraplane; from 1934 as Terraplane, until 1938 when the Terraplane was renamed the Hudson 112. Hudson also began assembling cars in Canada, contracting Canada Top and Body to build the cars in their Tilbury, Ontario, plant. In England, Terraplanes built at the Brentford factory were still being advertised in 1938.

An optional accessory on some 1935–1938 Hudson and Terraplane models was a steering column-mounted electric gear pre-selector and electro-mechanical automatic shifting system, known as the &quot;Electric Hand&quot;, manufactured by the Bendix Corporation. This took the place of the floor-mounted shift lever, but required conventional clutch actions. Cars equipped with the feature also carried a conventional shift lever in clips under the dash, which could be pulled out and put to use in case the Electric Hand should ever fail. Hudson was also noted for offering an optional vacuum-powered automatic clutch, starting in the early 1930s.

==Hudson Eight==
For the 1930 model year, Hudson debuted a new flathead inline eight cylinder engine with block and crankcase cast as a unit and fitted with two cylinder heads. A 2.75-inch bore and 4.5-inch stroke displaced developing at 3,600 rpm with the standard 5.78:1 compression ratio. The five main bearing crankshaft had eight integral counterweights, an industry first, and also employed a Lanchester vibration damper. Four rubber blocks were used at engine mount points. A valveless oil pump improved the Hudson splash lubrication system.

The new eights were the only engine offering in the Hudson line, supplanting the Super Six, which continued in the Essex models.

At the 1931 Indianapolis 500, Buddy Marr&#x27;s #27 &quot;Hudson Special&quot; (using a Winfield carburetor) finished the 200 laps in tenth place.

==1936–1942==

In 1936, Hudson revamped its cars, introducing a new &quot;radial safety control&quot; / &quot;rhythmic ride&quot; suspension which suspended the live front axle from two steel bars, as well as from leaf springs. Doing this allowed the use of longer, softer leaf springs (&quot;rhythmic ride&quot;), and prevented bumps and braking from moving the car off course. The 1936 Hudsons were also considerably larger inside than competitive cars — Hudson claimed a interior, comparing it to the in the &quot;largest of other popular cars&quot; of the time. With an optional bulging trunk lid, Hudson claimed the trunk could accommodate of luggage. The 1936 engines were powerful for the time, from .

The 1939 models joined other American cars in the use of a column-mounted gearshift lever. This freed front-seat passenger space and remained the industry standard through the 1960s, when &quot;bucket seats&quot; came into vogue. Hudson became the first car manufacturer to use foam rubber in its seats. The Hudson Terraplane was dropped. For the 1940 models, Hudson introduced coil spring independent front suspension, aircraft-style shock absorbers mounted within the front springs, and true center-point steering on all its models, a major advance in performance among cars in this price range. The Super Six model was reintroduced as well. Despite all these changes, Hudson&#x27;s sales for 1940 were lower than in 1939 and the company lost money again. The advent of military contracts the following year brought relief.

The 1941 Hudsons retained the front-end styling of the 1940 models but the bodies were new with 5.5 inches added to their length giving more legroom. A new manual 3-speed synchromesh transmission was quieter with all helical gears. Wheelbases increased by 3 inches, with offerings of 116, 121, and 128 inches, and height was decreased with flatter roofs. Convertibles now had a power-operated top. Big Boy trucks now used the 128-inch wheelbase. In 1942, as a response to General Motors&#x27; Hydramatic automatic transmission, Hudson introduced its &quot;Drive-Master&quot; system. Drive-Master was a more sophisticated combination of the concepts used in the Electric Hand and the automatic clutch. It contained a vacuum-powered module on the transmission to switch between second and third gear and a vacuum-powered module to pull the clutch in and out. At the touch of a button, Drive-Master offered the driver a choice of three modes of operation: ordinary, manual shifting and clutching; manual shifting with automatic clutching; and automatic shifting with automatic clutching. All this was accomplished by a large and complicated mechanism located under the hood. They worked well, and in fully automatic mode served as a good semi-automatic transmission. When coupled with an automatic overdrive, Drive-Master became known as Super-Matic. Re-engineering of the frame rear end to use lower springs reduced car height by . Sheet metal &quot;spats&quot; on the lower body now covered the running boards and new wider front and rear fenders accommodated this.

==Female designer==
As the role of women increased in car-purchase decisions, automakers began to hire female designers. Hudson, wanting a female perspective on automotive design, hired Elizabeth Ann Thatcher in 1939, one of America&#x27;s first female automotive designers. Her contributions to the 1941 Hudson included exterior trim with side lighting, interior instrument panel, interiors and interior trim fabrics. She designed for Hudson from 1939 into 1941, leaving the company when she married Joe Oros, then a designer for Cadillac. He later became head of the design team at Ford that created the Mustang.

==World War II==
As ordered by the Federal government, Hudson ceased auto production from 1942 until 1945 to manufacture material during World War II, including aircraft parts and naval engines as well as anti-aircraft guns. The Hudson &quot;Invader&quot; engine powered many of the landing craft used on the D-Day invasion of Normandy, June 6, 1944.

During World War II Hudson had also an aircraft division that produced ailerons for one large eastern airplane builder. The plant was capable of large scale production of wings and ailerons as well as other airplane parts. On May 22, 1941, Hudson was given a contract for the Oerlikon 20 mm cannon with the Jefferson Avenue Plant, on Jefferson Avenue and Connor Avenue, responsible for converting the original Swiss drawings to American production standards. The company produced 33,201 Oerlikons for the United States Navy with the original mechanism continued in use without major change and with complete interchangeability of parts until the end of the war. Hudson also manufactured millions of other weaponry and vehicle parts for the war effort. Hudson ranked 83rd among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.

==Fisher takeover attempt==
The Fisher Body Company, later the Fisher Body Division of GM, manufactured bodies for many automobile marques throughout the early 20th Century. From 1926 the business had become part of General Motors. Just before World War II, the Fisher brothers contemplated a takeover of Hudson and commissioned engineer Roscoe C. (Rod) Hoffman, from Detroit, to design and build several rear-engine prototype vehicles for possible eventual production as Hudsons. One prototype was built in secret in 1935.

World War II forced the brothers to shelve their plans while the company shifted its focus to the war effort. When brothers Fred and Charles retired from GM in 1944 they revived the Hudson takeover idea with the view of establishing new, independent automobile manufacturing operations. The brothers contacted Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, Hudson&#x27;s main stockholder, offering to buy. Using an intermediary, Queen Wilhelmina expressed her interest in selling, prompting the Fisher brothers to begin devoting time to Hudson and their plant in anticipation of a deal. When news of these events reached Wall Street, the price of Hudson stock skyrocketed with the consensus by investors that a Fisher takeover would be the best thing for Hudson. However, the Fisher brothers tender offer fell short of Hudson&#x27;s sudden increased market value and the deal did not go through.

==1946–1954==


Production resumed after the war and included a wheelbase three-quarter-ton pickup truck.

In 1948, the company launched its &quot;step-down&quot; bodies, which lasted through the 1954 model year. The term step-down referred to Hudson&#x27;s placement of the passenger compartment down inside the perimeter of the frame; riders stepped down onto a floor that was surrounded by the perimeter of the car&#x27;s frame. The result was not only a safer car, and greater passenger comfort as well, but, through a lower center of gravity, a good handling car. In time almost all U.S. automakers would embrace it as a means of building bodies. Automotive author Richard Langworth described the step-down models as the greatest autos of the era in articles for &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; and &quot;Collectible Automobile&quot;.

For the 1951 model year, the 6-cylinder engine received a new block with thicker walls and other improvements to boost horsepower by almost 18% and torque by 28.5% making Hudson a hot performer again. The GM-supplied 4-speed Hydramatic automatic transmission was now optional in Hornets and Commodore Custom 6s and 8s.

Hudson&#x27;s strong, light-weight bodies, combined with its high-torque inline six-cylinder engine technology, made the company&#x27;s 1951–54 Hornet an auto racing champion, dominating NASCAR in 1951, 1952, 1953, and 1954.

Herb Thomas won the 1951 and 1954 Southern 500s and Dick Rathmann won in 1952. Some NASCAR records set by Hudson in the 1950s (&quot;e.g.&quot; consecutive wins in one racing season) still stand even today. Hudson cars also did very well in races sanctioned by the AAA Contest Board from 1952 until 1954 with Marshall Teague winning the 1952 AAA Stock Car Championship and Frank Mundy in 1953. Often Hudsons finished in most of the top positions in races. Later, these cars met with some success in drag racing, where their high power-to-weight ratio worked to their advantage. Hudsons enjoyed success both in NHRA trials and local dirt track events.

As the post-war marketplace shifted from a seller&#x27;s to a buyer&#x27;s market the smaller U.S. automakers, such as Hudson and Nash, found it increasingly difficult to compete with the Big Three (Ford, GM and Chrysler) during the 1950s. A sales war between Ford and General Motors conducted during 1953 and 1954 had left little business for the much smaller &quot;independent&quot; automakers trying to compete against the standard models offered by the domestic Big Three. The Big Three could afford constant development and styling changes, so that their cars looked fresh every year, whereas the smaller manufacturers could only afford gradual changes. Hudson&#x27;s once-innovative &quot;step-down&quot; unit-body construction, while sturdy and innovative, also made restyling difficult and expensive. Although Hudsons dominated racing during this period, their feats did little to affect showroom traffic despite incorporating their NASCAR success into a marketing campaign known as &quot;Win on Sunday, Sell on Monday&quot;. Sales fell each year from 1951 until 1954, and only Korean War military contracts kept the company solvent. On March 20, 1954, the Hudson Motor Car Company reported a loss of $10,411,060 in 1953 as compared with a profit of $8,307,847 in 1952.

After the company&#x27;s high-priced Jet compact car line failed to capture buyers in its second straight year, Hudson CEO A.E. Barit engaged with George W. Mason, CEO of Nash-Kelvinator (makers of Nash and Rambler) to discuss the possibility of a merger with Nash. Mason already had the vision of merging the four independent automakers (Nash, Hudson, Packard, and Studebaker) into one company to compete with the Big Three, having floated the idea as early as 1946 with Packard to no avail. Mason had previously discussed the idea with Barit in 1952. On 14 January 1954 an agreement was reached and Nash and Hudson executives took the first steps to bring the two companies together.

==1954 – Merger with Nash-Kelvinator==

On May 1, 1954, Hudson merged with Nash-Kelvinator to become American Motors Corporation. George W. Mason became CEO and president of AMC while Hudson&#x27;s president, A.E. Barit retired to become an AMC board member.

The Hudson factory, located in Detroit, Michigan, was converted to military contract production at the end of the model year, and the remaining three years of Hudson production took place at the Nash plant in Kenosha, Wisconsin building rebadged Nash cars with the Hudson brand name. Nash would focus most of its marketing resources on its smaller Rambler models, and Hudson would focus its marketing efforts on its full-sized cars. The first Hudson model to terminate production was the Jet. The new company could then focus on the more successful Nash Rambler. Henceforth, Hudson dealers would have badge-engineered versions of the Nash Rambler and Metropolitan compacts to sell as Hudson products.

One of the first things Mason did as CEO of the new company was to initiate talks with James J. Nance, president of Packard, for parts-sharing arrangements between AMC and Packard. At this time AMC did not have its own V8 engine and an agreement was made for the new Packard V8 engine and Packard&#x27;s Ultramatic automatic transmission to be used in the 1955 Nash Ambassador and Hudson Hornet models.

In July 1954, Packard acquired Studebaker to form Studebaker-Packard Corporation. However further talks of a merger between AMC and Studebaker-Packard were cut short when Mason died on October 8, 1954. A week after his death, Mason&#x27;s successor, George W. Romney, announced &quot;There are no mergers under way either directly or indirectly&quot;. Nevertheless, Romney continued with Mason&#x27;s commitment to buy components from Studebaker-Packard Corporation. Although Mason and Nance had previously agreed that Studebaker-Packard would purchase parts from AMC, it did not do so. Moreover, Packard&#x27;s engines and transmissions were comparatively expensive, so AMC began development of its own V8 engine, and replaced the outsourced unit by mid-1956.

==1955–1957==
For 1955, both Hudson and Nash senior models were built on a common automobile platform using styling themes by Pinin Farina, Edmund E. Anderson, and Frank Spring. Common-body shell production for competing makes of automobiles was a manufacturing technique that had been used by the Big Three for decades. 
Anderson set up separate design studios for Nash, Hudson, and Rambler.

Although the 1955 Hudson used the inner body shell of the Nash, the car incorporated a front cowl originally designed by Spring and the Hudson team to be put on the 1954 Step-Down platform. The 1955 models also used the Hudson dashboard, &quot;triple safe brakes&quot; and the Nash Weather Eye heater with Harrison Radiator Corporation-supplied lower cost Freon/compressor type air conditioning.

For the first time, Hudson offered a V8 engine starting for the 1955 model year. It was the Packard-designed and -built engine rated at . All cars with the Packard V8 also came with Packard&#x27;s Ultramatic automatic transmission as an option for $494 with the Nash 3-speed manual was also available at $295.

Hudson dealers also sold Rambler and Metropolitan models under the Hudson brand. A total of 4,357 Metropolitans were sold as &quot;Hudson.&quot; When sold by Hudson dealers, both cars were identified as Hudson vehicles via hood/grille emblems and horn buttons. Hudson Ramblers also received &quot;H&quot; symbols on fuel filler caps (and, in 1956, also on hubcaps).

In 1956, ex-Hudson president A.E Barit resigned from the Board in protest over the likelihood that Hudson would be phased out of production.

For 1956, the design of the senior Hudsons was given over to designer Richard Arbib, which resulted in the &quot;V-Line&quot; styling motif, a combination of &quot;V&quot; motifs that carried Hudson&#x27;s triangular corporate logo theme. Sales fell below the 1955 figures.

With a wider front track than Nash used, Hudson was the better handling car and was powered by the famed Hornet Six with the optional high-compression cylinder head and dual-carburetor manifold (&quot;Twin-H Power&quot;); the Twin H would disappear at the end of the 1956 model year.

The Wasp used the L-head Jet Six engine (up to ) and this model (in sedan version) was Hudson&#x27;s top seller. For 1957, Hudson dropped the shorter-wheelbase Wasp line, selling only the Hornet Custom and Super, which featured a lowered profile and slightly updated styling.

George W. Romney felt that Hudson and Nash were no longer relevant players in the automotive market and retired both names at the end of the 1957 model year production. Both Rambler and Metropolitan became makes in their own right, and no longer were identified as Hudson or Nash.

==End of the line==
The last Hudson rolled off the Kenosha assembly line on June 25, 1957, although at that time there were proposals of continuing the Hudson and Nash names into the 1958 model year on the Rambler chassis as deluxe, longer-wheelbase senior models. The combined Nash and Hudson production volume was insufficient to justify all-new design and tooling; therefore, the Rambler&#x27;s platform was expected to be adopted by the longer cars. One major trade magazine said rumors of discontinuance were false and the 1958 Hudsons and Nashes &quot;would be big and smart&quot;. Factory styling photographs show designs for a 1958 Hudson (and Nash) line based on a longer-wheelbase 1958 Rambler. Front-end prototype photos show separate Hudson and Nash styling themes.

American Motors&#x27; president, George W. Romney, concluded that the only way to compete with the &quot;Big Three&quot; was to stake the future of AMC on a new smaller-sized car line. Neither Hudson nor Nash brand names had as much positive market recognition as the successful Rambler and their sales were lagging. Together with AMC&#x27;s chief engineer Meade Moore, Romney had completely phased out the Nash and Hudson brands at the end of 1957. The decision to retire the brands came so quickly that preproduction photographs of the eventual 1958 Rambler Ambassador show both Nash- and Hudson-badged versions. The Rambler brand was selected for further development and promotion while focusing exclusively on compact cars.

Eventually, however, something close to the Hudson design was chosen for the 1958 Rambler Ambassador. Hudson brand enthusiasts will note the triangular grille guard and 1957-like fender &quot;gun sights&quot; and the fast-selling 1958 Rambler Customs wore 1957 Hudson-styled front-fender trim.

==International markets==
Hudson, Essex, and Terraplane vehicles were either exported as complete cars or locally built from knock-down kits in many countries making the Hudson marque well-known internationally as well as domestically. In its 1929 report, the banking house Garden Detroit Company reported that in 1928 Hudson shipped 50,587 vehicles overseas, or 17.9% of total production. By March 1929 Hudson had topped all previous production figures having exported 44,295 cars in March alone, bringing the total of shipments for the first quarter of 1929 to an all-time high of 108,298.

===Australia===


Hudson vehicles were imported into Australia in 1913 by Brisbane company McGhie Motor Company.

In 1915 the Sydney branch of Dalgety &amp; Co. Ltd became the distributor of Hudson and Essex vehicles for New South Wales. The company was also the agent for Wolseley, Daimler, and Buick passenger vehicles as well as Lacre and Halley commercial vehicles. Motor bodies were produced by Messrs Henderson, Boulton, and Kirkham in Regent Street, Sydney. The company also did trimming, fitting, painting, mechanical work, and repairs.

Established in 1922, Sydney company Smith &amp; Waddington set up motor vehicle body building operations for NSW and Queensland at premises on Parramatta Road, Camperdown. The company built &quot;custom&quot; car bodies which, by the terminology of the day, meant &quot;built to an individual order and to a special design.&quot; In addition to assembling Hudson and Essex for Dalgety, the company also built vehicle bodies for Rolls-Royce, Wolseley, Dort, Benz, Fiat, and Turkat Méry. After a slump in the economy which caused operations to cease in November 1927, Smith &amp; Waddington resumed production in June 1928, again building Hudson and Essex vehicles for NSW and Queensland, and further adding Dodge, Chrysler, Erskine, and Studebaker for the whole of Australia. Additionally, Sydney coach builder G.H Olding &amp; Sons are known to have built 6 Terraplane phaetons for Dalgety in 1934.

In 1926 a new company, Leader Motors Limited was formed to be the exclusive distributor of Hudson and Essex motor vehicles in Queensland. The bodies were made by South Australian company Holden&#x27;s Motor Body Builders in Brisbane. In its main facility of Adelaide, Holden also made motor bodies for Austin, Buick, Chevrolet, Cleveland, Dodge, Fiat, Oakland, Oldsmobile, Overland, Reo, Studebaker, and Willys Knight.

Hudson and Essex assembly began in Victoria by Neal&#x27;s Motors of Port Melbourne in 1927. The contract to build the bodies was initially given to TJ Richards &amp; Sons of Keswick, Adelaide to supply for Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania as well as acting as a second source of supply for New South Wales and Queensland. Holden&#x27;s Motor Body Builders also built bodies. Holden&#x27;s records show that for 1927 the Adelaide plant built 1,641 Essex vehicles and 8 Hudsons, and for 1928 a total of 1,931 Essex vehicles and 59 Hudsons were assembled. Holden&#x27;s final year for Hudson and Essex production was in 1928, and in 1931 the company was bought out by General Motors.

In February 1934 Ruskins Body Works of West Melbourne secured the contract to build Hudson and Terraplane bodies for the whole of Australia. In June 1937, Neal&#x27;s Motors celebrated assembling its 30,000th automobile: a 1937 Hudson Terraplane.

In 1939 Dalgety sold their automotive business to agent for Packard motor vehicles, Ira L. &amp; A.C Berk in Sydney, which thereafter became the distributors for Hudson in NSW and QLD. The company opened a manufacturing plant in Belmore, Sydney in February 1949.

After the end of World War II, Australia legislated to restrict the use of U.S. dollars which were in desperately short supply. The use of U.S. dollars to import cars thereafter required a government permit restricting the purchase of American cars only to those with access to U.S. funds held overseas such as consular staff and visiting entertainers. Despite this, Australian distributors of Hudson, Nash, Packard, and Studebaker were able to bring in limited numbers of US-built, factory right-hand-drive vehicles from 1946.

A report by Dunlop Australia about Australian car sales from 1932 until 1949 noted that Hudson vehicles (including Essex and Terraplane) totaled 10,424 units during the 17-years, coming in at 13th place overall. It was noted in the report generally that all marques in Australia experienced the greatest number of sales before World War II.

In 1960, six years after the merger of Hudson and Nash-Kelvinator to form American Motors Corporation, Australian Motor Industries (AMI) of Port Melbourne would form an agreement with AMC to assemble Ramblers in Australia.

===Canada===
Canadian assembly of Hudson vehicles commenced in 1932 by Hudson Motors of Canada in Tilbury, Ontario. The factory building was owned by Canadian Top &amp; Body Co. which built the motor bodies for the vehicles. The first models assembled were a series of Hudson Eights. World War II interrupted operations and production ceased in 1941. Post-war operations resumed in 1950, with Hudsons being assembled by Chatco Steel Products in Tilbury, Ontario. Operations ceased in 1954 following the Nash-Hudson merger that led to the formation of American Motors Corporation. Toronto-based Nash Motors of Canada Ltd. became American Motors (Canada) Ltd. and all subsequent AMC operations continued in Toronto until its closure in 1957. Local production of Ramblers resumed after AMC&#x27;s Brampton, Ontario plant opened in December 1960.

===Germany===
Hudson and Essex vehicles were assembled in Berlin, Germany, during the 1920s by Hudson Essex Motors Company m.b.H Berlin-Spandau. The cars were built with the speedometer in kilometers, while the fuel, oil, and temperature gauges remained in their original non-metric units.

===New Zealand===


Hudson and Essex vehicles were imported into North Island by Dominion Motors of Wellington which began operations in 1912. Dominion Motors amalgamated with Universal Motor Company of Christchurch in 1919 forming an assembly operation for Hudson and Essex as well as Oldsmobile, Crossley, Chevrolet, Stutz, Rolls-Royce, and (pre-GM) Vauxhall. Vehicles were assembled and finished in-house from partial knock-down kits.

For South Island, Hudson and Essex vehicles were imported by W.G. Vining Limited of Nelson, beginning in 1912. Vining had built a garage in 1908 which was the largest garage in New Zealand at the time. A car assembly plant was established at the premises and shortly thereafter Vinings obtained licenses to import and assemble Cadillac, Maxwell, Haynes, and Ford vehicles from the United States; Bean cars from the United Kingdom; and Darracq and Unic vehicles from France. Along with Hudson and Essex, the plant later assembled Chevrolet and Rover vehicles. The business ceased when it was sold on 30 September 1927 upon W.G. Vining&#x27;s retirement. Vining&#x27;s son formed a new business, P. Vining &amp; Scott, and continued the Hudson and Essex franchise, adding Morris in 1932.

New Zealand car sales for the first nine months of 1927 saw Essex in third place with 898 vehicles sold, behind Chevrolet in second place with 1,100 vehicles sold, and Ford in first place with 1651 vehicles sold. Hudson made 12th place with 206 sales.

From 1935, Hudson vehicles (along with Nash, Studebaker, and Standard) were assembled by Christchurch company Motor Assemblies Limited. Production ended when the company was acquired by Standard-Triumph International in 1954. Hudson production then went to Motor Holdings Ltd which had been founded in 1936 as the Zealand franchise of Jowett Motors. After Jowett&#x27;s closure in the United Kingdom in 1954, Motor Holdings won the Volkswagen franchise, and its Auckland operation was renamed VW Motors for the production of VWs in New Zealand. VW Motors assembled Hudsons as a secondary line. Some were fully imported as special orders. 

After the Hudson and Nash marques were discontinued by American Motors Corporation, VW Motors assembled AMC&#x27;s new Rambler motor vehicles at its new Otahuhu Volkswagen plant from 1958 until 1962. AMC formed an agreement in 1963 with Campbell Motor Industries (CMI) of Thames to assemble Ramblers, production of which ran from 1964 until 1971.

===South Africa===

Beginning in the 1920s, Hudson and Willys motor vehicles were assembled in South Africa from right-hand-drive complete knock-down (CKD) kits sourced from Canada by Stanley Motors at their plant, National Motor Assemblers (NMA), in Natalspruit (Gauteng). After World War II, NMA built Austin, Standard, and Triumph vehicles at different times.

After the formation of American Motors Corporation in 1954, NMA continued to assemble AMC Ramblers until 1967.

===United Kingdom===
Hudsons were introduced to the United Kingdom in 1911. No shipments were possible during the First World War but as soon as the Armistice was signed exports resumed to the U.K. Hudsons and Essex vehicles were sold through ten concessionaires.

In 1922 Hudson-Essex Motors of Great Britain Limited was formed, with new premises on Dordrecht Road, in Acton Vale. Over 100 agents were appointed to sell the vehicles resulting in 2,000 sales in the next 12 months.

In 1926 a factory was built on a property next to the recently opened Great West Road in Brentford. The plant opened in 1927 and a year later a three-story building was built as a service department for Hudson and Essex vehicles. The factory assembled the vehicle chassis locally, but the bodies were imported as complete units from Detroit.

From 1932, the bodies came over from the United States in sections to be assembled at the Great West Road factory. After the Essex marque was retired in 1932 the British company was renamed Hudson Motors Ltd.

Hudson&#x27;s new Terraplane model was equally as popular in the U.K. as it was in the United States. English-designed and built bodies were built on the Terraplane frames and the cars were entered in many automobile races including the Monte Carlo Rally. Some of the cars entered were driven by personnel from the Great West Road factory. A Hudson Pacemaker won first place in the 1931 Scottish Rally and another Pacemaker took 7th place in the 1932 Torquay Rally. The Team Award was won by two Terraplane tourers and a Terraplane saloon in the 1933 Scottish Rally.

A triangular site from the railway was developed in 1926 for a new Hudson-Essex factory. This was the first major industrial facility and became a major employer along the Great West Road. Other firms followed to establish what became known as the &quot;Golden Mile.&quot; The Chiswick Roundabout (the junction of Chiswick High Road, North Circular Road, South Circular Road, and the A4 Great West Road) also became known as &quot;Hudson&#x27;s Corner.&quot; After World War II, the property was used by the Kelvinator Refrigerator Company.

After the Hudson and Nash merger, the British company became a subsidiary of American Motors Corporation and was renamed Rambler Motors (A.M.C.) Limited in 1961, taking over from Nash Concessionaires Ltd. as the importer of AMC&#x27;s new Rambler vehicles. The company imported AMC vehicles, many in factory right-hand-drive, well into the 1970s.

==Legacy==

In 1928, a one yuan coin called the Auto Dollar was minted by the Chinese warlord to commemorate the construction of roadways in Guizhou province. The coin features an image of an automobile reminiscent of a soft-topped Hudson car, although it does not correspond to any particular model exactly.

For the 1970 model year, American Motors revived the &quot;Hornet&quot; model name for its new series of compact cars (the AMC Hornet). AMC was later purchased by Chrysler, which at one time considered reintroducing the Hornet name in the Dodge model line and ultimately did so for the 2023 model year with a car based on the Alfa Romeo Tonale.

The last Hudson dealership was Miller Motors in Ypsilanti, Michigan, which is now part of the Ypsilanti Automotive Heritage Museum.

The Hostetler Hudson Auto Museum in Shipshewana, Indiana, featured a collection of restored Hudsons. Eldon Hostetler was an inventor who owned a Hudson as a teenager and later purchased Hudson cars and restored them. The museum closed in 2018 after the Hudson Automobile Museum Board voted in favor of closing the museum and liquidating the collection.

A restored Hudson Dealership sign still occupies its original site on Highway 32 in Chico, California.

<doc id="364601" wikidata="Q7782618" url="?curid=364601" title="There's Something About Miriam">
<text>There&#x27;s Something About Miriam is a British reality television series broadcast by Sky1. The six-episode series premiered on 22 February 2004 and concluded on 24 March 2004. Set in Ibiza, Spain, the series depicted six men in competition for a £10,000 reward over who could make the best impression on 21-year-old Mexican model Miriam Rivera. The men were required to compete in various physical challenges in addition to going on individual and group dates with Rivera. In the final episode, Rivera selected the one contestant who left the best impression on her; upon selection, Rivera revealed to the contestants that she was a transgender woman who had not yet undergone gender-affirming surgery. The series was hosted by Welsh television presenter Tim Vincent.

The series aired on Fox Reality Channel in 2007.

==Production and filming==
Remy Blumenfeld first saw Rivera participating in a girl band, after which he planned to cast her in a TV show. The show was produced by the Brighter Pictures subsidiary of Endemol and was originally titled &quot;Find Me a Man&quot;. Recruitment ads for contestants promised &quot;the adventure of a lifetime&quot; with a £10,000 prize for men aged 20 to 35 who &quot;want it all&quot; and are &quot;fit and up for everything.&quot; The contestants on the show were:

* Mark Dimino, 24, optician
* Toby Green, 23, student
* Aron Lane, 22, chef
* Tom Rooke, 23, lifeguard and ex-ski instructor
* Scott Gibson, 22, martial arts expert
* Dominic Conway, 28, Royal Marine

Brighter Pictures managing director Gavin Hay said &quot;they had made a point of never referring to Miriam as a woman when getting the men to take part.&quot;

Rivera said &quot;Several of them wondered about me in the first few days. But as the series unfolded, I really thought that we got to like and know each other as friends and had a lot of fun.&quot; In response to allegations that she revealed her big secret by lifting up her skirt she was quoted as saying &quot;I would never lift my skirt up on national TV. My mother brought me up very well.&quot; On the version that aired, Rivera chose Rooke as the winner and then said in front of the assembled contestants:

Miriam&#x27;s childhood friend suspects this quote was scripted.

Rooke initially accepted the prize money and the trip with Rivera on camera. Rooke later rejected the prize prior to airing and joined the other contestants in a lawsuit that sought to prevent the airing of the show.

==Litigation and release==
Following the completion of the show, it was scheduled to air in November 2003, but a lawsuit by the contestants delayed the airing. They alleged conspiracy to commit sexual assault, defamation, breach of contract, and personal injury in the form of psychological and emotional damage.

After the men settled for an undisclosed amount, the show premiered 22 February, and the sixth and final episode aired 24 March 2004.

The show was aired in Australia by Network Ten in May 2004, in Lithuania by TV3 in December 2004, in Poland by TVN in January 2005, and in Argentina in 2005 on América TV. The show was picked up by Fox Reality for airing in the United States in April 2006, and was aired in October 2007.

==Reception==
Responses from critics were generally unfavourable, calling it part of a trend in shows that exploit unwitting contestants. A British reviewer noted &quot;The whole premise of &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Miriam&quot; was not a celebration of transgender people&#x27;s lives. It was designed to elicit horror from the winning contestant discovering that his dream date had a penis.&quot; The show was also criticized by transgender groups, who feared a backlash of public opinion. When the show aired in Australia, reviews were critical of both the premise and Rivera:

These guys were duped in more ways than one – while Miriam has a few unexpected bits in her package, she&#x27;s notably deficient in others. It has become clear Miriam requires a personality implant. It must&#x27;ve been a challenge to find a transsexual pretty enough, mean enough and sufficiently attention-seeking to play this tawdry game, but what these producers found in Miriam is a sultry-looking dill prone to the cheesiest of clichés.

Other British commentators contrasted Rivera with the positive response to Nadia Almada, a Portuguese-born transgender woman who won &quot;Big Brother UK&quot; a few months later. That show was also produced by Endemol.

However, the show garnered high ratings in the final episode (970,000 viewers—large viewership for Sky One), and Rivera went on to become a guest on &quot;Big Brother Australia 2004&quot;.

&quot;There&#x27;s Something About Miriam&quot; was featured on the 2005 clip show &quot;40 Greatest Pranks&quot; on VH1 and was ranked #11 on the &quot;20 to One&quot; episode &quot;Hoaxes, Cheats and Liars&quot;.

When the show aired in the United States on the 2007 Transgender Day of Remembrance, trans author Julia Serano noted &quot;Programs like &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Miriam&quot; not only reinforce the stereotype that trans people&#x27;s birth sex is &#x27;real&#x27; and our identified/lived sex is &#x27;fake,&#x27; but they perpetuate the myth of deception and thus enable violence against us.&quot;

Video artist Phil Collins featured contestant Mark Dimino in an installation on &quot;people who believe their lives have been ruined by appearing on reality TV.&quot;

== In popular culture ==
In 2021 Wondery published an investigative podcast series, &quot;Harsh Reality: The Story of Miriam Rivera,&quot; into Rivera&#x27;s life and her appearance on the show&quot;.&quot; In June 2022, a similar three-part documentary series, called &quot;Miriam: Death of a Reality Star&quot;, was commissioned by Expectation Entertainment for Channel 4.

<doc id="364612" wikidata="Q3289526" url="?curid=364612" title="18th Army Group">
<text>The 18th Army Group was an Allied formation in the Second World War. It was formed on 20 February 1943 when British Eighth Army advancing from the east and British First Army advancing into Tunisia from the west came close enough to require coordinated command during the Tunisia Campaign.

==History==
The 18th Army Group was commanded by General Sir Harold Alexander and came under General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Commander-in-Chief Allied Forces Headquarters (AFHQ).

Its principal formations were the British Eighth Army, under Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery and the British First Army under Lieutenant-General Kenneth Anderson. Eighth Army had three British Army corps under its command which contained a variety of forces from the British Empire. They were British X Corps, British XIII Corps and British XXX Corps. They had fought across virtually the whole North African shore to the east of Tunisia after winning a victory at the Second Battle of El Alamein in November 1942. First Army had four corps under its command, but the corps themselves were far more varied in national origin. Two were of British origin; V Corps and IX Corps. The other corps were U.S. II Corps and French XIX Corps. First Army controlled the forces that had landed in Morocco and Algeria in November 1942 in the first of the great Allied amphibious assaults of the war, Operation Torch.

18th Army Group was faced by two German and one Italian armies, Panzer Army Afrika under &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Erwin Rommel and 5th Panzer Army under &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Hans-Jürgen von Arnim, while the Italian 1st Army under Marshal Giovanni Messe. The two German commanders disliked each other, and so often strategy was not coordinated.

Both the First Army and Eighth Army had enjoyed very quick initial success in their campaigns after November 1942. Once they reached Tunisia two things halted them. One was overextension of lines of communication and the other was the greater concentration of German troops that the smaller defended area produced. First Army in particular received stinging blows from Rommel at the Battle of Kasserine Pass. Rommel&#x27;s veteran formations slammed into II Corps and the green American troops did not perform well. It was only after reinforcements of more experienced troops and quantities of artillery had been rushed in that the situation was stabilised.

Following the Kasserine Pass engagement and an Allied consolidation, a fresh attack was launched. First Army led the main attack, with Eighth Army providing support along the eastern coast of Tunisia. That attack lead eventually in May 1943 to the surrender of Axis forces in Africa. 250,000 men were taken prisoner, a number equal to that at Stalingrad on the Eastern Front earlier in the year.

General Alexander sent the message, &quot;We are masters of the North African shore.&quot; 18th Army Group was disbanded in Tunisia on 15 May 1943.

Duke through a merger between a number of U.S. tobacco manufacturers including Allen and Ginter, Goodwin &amp; Company, and Kinney Brothers. The company was one of the original 12 members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 1896. The American Tobacco Company dominated the industry by acquiring the Lucky Strike Company and over 200 other rival firms. Federal Antitrust action begun in 1907 broke the company into several major companies in 1911.

The American Tobacco Company restructured itself in 1969, forming a holding company called American Brands, Inc., which operated American Tobacco as a subsidiary. American Brands acquired a variety of non-tobacco businesses during the 1970s and 1980s and sold its tobacco operations to Brown &amp; Williamson in 1994. American Brands subsequently renamed itself &quot;Fortune Brands&quot;.

== History ==

=== Origins ===

James Buchanan Duke&#x27;s entrance into the cigarette industry came about in 1879 when he elected to enter a new business rather than face competition in the shredded pouched smoking tobacco business against the Bull Durham brand, also from Durham, North Carolina.

In 1882, two years after W. Duke, Sons &amp; Company entered into the cigarette business, James Bonsack invented a cigarette-rolling machine. It produced over 133 cigarettes per minute, the equivalent of what a skilled hand roller could produce in one hour, and reduced the cost of rolling cigarettes by 50%. It cut each cigarette with precision, creating uniformity in the cigarettes it rolled. Public stigma was attached to this machine-rolled uniformity, and Allen &amp; Ginter rejected the machine almost immediately.
The first Bonsack machine was installed in the Durham Duke tobacco plant on April 30, 1884. Duke set a deal with the Bonsack Machine Company when he installed his machine. Duke agreed to produce all cigarettes with his two rented Bonsack machines and in return, Bonsack reduced Duke&#x27;s royalties from $0.30 per thousand cigarettes to $0.20 per thousand. Duke also hired one of Bonsack&#x27;s mechanics, resulting in fewer breakdowns of his machines than his competitors’. This secret contract resulted in a competitive advantage over Duke&#x27;s competitors; he was able to lower his prices further than others could.

In the 1880s, while Duke was beginning to machine-roll all his cigarettes, he saw that growth rates in the cigarette industry were declining. His solution was to combine companies and found “one of the first great holding companies in American history.” Duke spent $800,000 on advertising in 1889 and lowered his prices, accepting net profits of less than $400,000, forcing his major competitors to lower their prices and, in 1890, join his consortium by the name of the American Tobacco Company. The five constituent companies of American Tobacco: W. Duke &amp; Sons, Allen &amp; Ginter, W.S. Kimball &amp; Company, Kinney Tobacco, and Goodwin &amp; Company – produced 90% of the cigarettes made in 1890, the first year the American Tobacco Company was listed on the NYSE. Within two decades of its founding, the American Tobacco company absorbed about 250 companies and produced 80% of the cigarettes, plug tobacco, smoking tobacco, and snuff produced in the United States. With Duke&#x27;s market control, American Tobacco grew its equity from $25,000,000 to $316,000,000.

=== The &quot;Tobacco Trust&quot; ===

American Tobacco Company quickly became known as the “Tobacco Trust” upon its founding. Duke controlled the cigarette market, and his trust caught the attention of legislators in the United States, a country with historical aversion to monopolies.
American Tobacco Company focused solely on making and selling cigarettes, leaving growing of tobacco and retail distribution to independent North Carolina farmers. Nonetheless, Duke aimed to eliminate inefficiencies and middlemen through vertical consolidation. Vertical consolidation is the act of buying companies that perform services or produce goods on different parts of the supply chain. The American Tobacco Company began to expand to Great Britain, China, and Japan. The company also maintained an interest in producing other tobacco products in case trends within the cigarette market shifted. Duke wanted to be sure that he would be prepared with a multitude of tobacco styles. While Duke did gain a sort of monopoly over the tobacco industry, the Tobacco Trust&#x27;s international expansion in conjunction with its consolidation of all types of tobacco “ultimately made the Trust so vulnerable to regulation and judicial dissolution”.

The Sherman Antitrust Act was passed in 1890, and in 1907, the American Tobacco Company was indicted in violation of it. In 1908, when the Department of Justice filed suit against the company, 65 companies and 29 individuals were named in the suit. The Supreme Court ordered the company to dissolve in 1911 on the same day that it ordered the Standard Oil Trust to dissolve. The ruling in &quot;United States v. American Tobacco Co.&quot; stated that the combination of the tobacco companies “in and of itself, as well as each and all of the elements composing it whether corporate or individual, whether considered collectively or separately [was] in restraint of trade and an attempt to monopolize, and a monopolization within the first and second sections of the Anti-Trust Act.”

=== Dissolution ===
Dissolution proved complicated. The American Tobacco Company had combined many prior companies and processes. One department would manage a certain process for the entire organization, producing brands previously owned by other companies. “Plants had been assigned specific products without regard for previous ownership.” Over the course of eight months, a plan for the dissolution, meant to assure competition among the new companies, was negotiated.

The trust needed to dissolve in such a way that no manufacturer had a monopoly on any type of tobacco product. Investors, holding millions of dollars of securities, also needed to be considered. A large question was how to distribute trademarks and brands between the resulting companies.

The American Tobacco Company&#x27;s assets were split off into: American Tobacco Company, the existing R. J. Reynolds, Liggett &amp; Myers, and Lorillard. The monopoly became an oligopoly. The main result of the dissolution of American Tobacco Trust and the creation of these companies was an increase in advertising and promotion in the industry as a form of competition.

==== Liggett &amp; Myers ====
Liggett &amp; Myers kept control of these plants: Liggett and Myers, St. Louis; Spaulding and Merrick, Chicago; Allen and Ginter, Richmond; smoking tobacco factory in Chicago; Nall and Williams, Louisville; John Bollman Company, San Francisco; Pinkerton Company, Toledo; W. R. Irby, New Orleans; two cigar factories in Baltimore and Philadelphia, and the Duke-Durham branch of the American Tobacco Company.

==== P. Lorillard ====
P. Lorillard retained the Lorillard properties in addition to S. Anargyos; the Luhrman and Wilburn Tobacco Company; plants in Philadelphia, Wilmington, Brooklyn, Baltimore, and Danville; and the Federal Cigar Company.

== More recent history ==

At the same time as the antitrust action in 1911, the company&#x27;s share in British American Tobacco (BAT) was sold. In 1994, BAT acquired its former parent, American Tobacco Company (though reorganized after antitrust proceedings). This brought the Lucky Strike and Pall Mall brands into BAT&#x27;s portfolio as part of BAT&#x27;s American arm, Brown &amp; Williamson. B&amp;W later merged with R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in 2004.

American Tobacco left Durham in the late 1980s. Brown &amp; Williamson took over the Reidsville, North Carolina operation in 1995 and closed it, costing 1000 people their jobs, but Commonwealth Brands took it over in a deal completed in October 1996, when the plant had 311 employees, and kept 100 of them. ITG Brands announced November 1, 2018 that the plant would close in 2020.

=== Redevelopment ===
In 2004, the previously abandoned American Tobacco Campus (ATC) in Durham was reopened as a complex of offices, shops, and restaurants. The American Tobacco Campus had been the headquarters of the American Tobacco Company. Developed by Capitol Broadcasting and reopened as the American Tobacco Historic District, phase 1 consisted of the Fowler, Crowe, Strickland, Reed, and Washington Buildings, and included the construction of two new parking garages and a waterfall feature through the center of the campus designed by Smallwood, Reynolds, Stewart, Stewart of Atlanta, Georgia and constructed by W. P. Law, Inc. based in Lexington, South Carolina. Phase 2, consisting of the remaining buildings and expansion of the water feature at the north end of the site, was under construction as of late 2006. Many office spaces in the ATC are now used by Duke University. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000 as the American Tobacco Company Manufacturing Plant. The nearby Watts and Yuille Warehouses were listed in 1984 and the Smith Warehouse in 1985.

The American Tobacco Trail, named for the company, is a multi-use rail-trail that begins just south of the Durham complex and runs towards Chatham and Wake Counties. It follows the route of the railroad (Norfolk Southern Railway (former) Durham Branch) that once served the factories, but was later abandoned when these facilities were shut down.

== Advertising ==
In 1925 George Washington Hill&#x27;s father died and he became the new president of the company. A year later Lucky Strike accounted for one fifth of U.S. cigarette sales, and the brand was among the five best-selling US-consumed cigarettes. In 1927 Hill began directing his marketing efforts toward women, which was the first female targeted advertising of cigarettes at this time. The success of the advertising campaign, which used movie actors and singers to promote the brand, can be attributed to Albert Lasker of the Lord &amp; Thomas agency, and Edward Bernays, both of whom were hired by Hill. Lucky Strike soon accounted for 38 percent of U.S. cigarette sales. During the Great Depression the company remained successful and Hill&#x27;s salary exceeded $2,000,000. He made a substantial investment in advertising and sponsored Your Hit Parade and the Jack Benny Show. He also sponsored Frank Sinatra, Ethel Smith and Lawrence Tibbett. In the golden age of radio, as well as early television, American Tobacco was known for advertisements featuring a fast-talking tobacco auctioneer named L. A. &quot;Speed&quot; Riggs. His rapid-fire and song-like patter would always end with the exclamation, &quot;Sold, American!&quot; Another famous tobacco auctioneer, F. E. Boone, was often heard in tandem with Riggs. These cigarette advertisements in conjunction with the cultural change that occurred for women in the United States during the 1920s, made cigarette consumption increasingly prevalent. In fact, not only was the public open to the idea of women smoking cigarettes, but manufacturers boldly advertised and encouraged feminine usage of the cigarette through cigarette cards. The advertising budgets of important cigarette manufacturers such as the American Tobacco Company rapidly expanded until the 1930s when they began to be somewhat moderated by the government.

===Cigarette cards===

From the 1870s to the 1940s, cigarette companies often included collectible trading cards with their packages of cigarettes. Cigarette card sets document popular culture from the turn of the century, often depicting the period&#x27;s actresses, costumes, and sports, as well as offering insights into mainstream humor and cultural norms.

American Tobacco commercialised its cards through several brands, such as &quot;Recruit&quot;, &quot;Mecca&quot;, &quot;Fatima&quot;, &quot;Ramly&quot;, &quot;Turkey Red&quot;. &quot;Old Judge&quot;. &quot;Old Mill&quot;, among others

<text>Denis Devlin (15 April 1908 – 21 August 1959) was, along with Samuel Beckett, Thomas MacGreevy and Brian Coffey, one of the generation of Irish modernist poets to emerge at the end of the 1920s. He was also a career diplomat.

==Early life and studies==

He was born in Greenock, Scotland of Irish parents, and his family returned to live in Dublin in 1918. He studied at Belvedere College and, from 1926, as a seminarian for the Roman Catholic priesthood at Clonliffe College. As part of his studies, he attended a degree course in modern languages at University College Dublin (UCD), where he met and befriended Brian Coffey. Together they published a joint collection, &quot;Poems&quot;, in 1930.

In 1927, Devlin abandoned the priesthood and left Clonliffe. He graduated with from UCD his BA in 1930 and spent that summer on the Blasket Islands to improve his spoken Irish. Between 1930 and 1933, he studied literature at Munich University and the Sorbonne in Paris, meeting, amongst others, Beckett and Thomas MacGreevy. He then returned to UCD to complete his MA thesis on Montaigne.

His niece Denyse Woods went on to become a writer.

==Diplomatic career and later writings==

He joined the Irish Diplomatic Service in 1935 and spent a number of years in Rome as the Irish Ambassador (1958), New York and Washington. During this time he met the French poet Saint-John Perse, and the Americans Allen Tate and Robert Penn Warren. He went on to publish a translation of &quot;Exile and Other Poems&quot; by St-John Perse, and Tate and Warren edited his posthumous &quot;Selected Poems&quot;.

Since his death, there have been two &quot;Collected Poems&quot; published; the first in 1964 was edited by Coffey and the second in 1989 by J.C.C. Mays.

His personal papers are held in University College Dublin Archives.

<text>The Good Soldier Švejk () is an unfinished satirical dark comedy novel by Czech writer Jaroslav Hašek, published in 1921–1923, about a good-humored, simple-minded, middle-aged man who appears to be enthusiastic to serve Austria-Hungary in World War I.

&quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot; is the abbreviated title; the original Czech title of the work is Osudy dobrého vojáka Švejka za světové války, i.e. &quot;The Fateful Adventures of the Good Soldier Švejk During the World War&quot; in English translation. The book is the most translated novel of Czech literature, having been translated into over 50 languages.

== Publication ==
Hašek originally intended &quot;Švejk&quot; to cover a total of six volumes, but had completed only three (and started on the fourth) upon his death from heart failure on January 3, 1923.

The novel as a whole was originally illustrated (after Hašek&#x27;s death) by Josef Lada and more recently by Czech illustrator Petr Urban.

The volumes are:
# &quot;Behind the Lines&quot; (&quot;V zázemí&quot;, 1921)
# &quot;At the Front&quot; (&quot;Na frontě&quot;, 1922)
# &quot;The Glorious Licking&quot; (&quot;Slavný výprask&quot;, 1922)
# &quot;The Glorious Licking Continues&quot; (&quot;Pokračování slavného výprasku&quot;, 1923; unfinished)

Following Hašek&#x27;s death, journalist Karel Vaněk was asked by the publisher Adolf Synek to complete the unfinished novel. Vaněk finished the fourth book in 1923 and in the same year also released the fifth and the sixth volumes, titled &quot;Švejk in Captivity&quot; (&quot;Švejk v zajetí&quot;) and &quot;Švejk in Revolution&quot; (&quot;Švejk v revoluci&quot;). These later novels were not published until 1949. In 1991 volumes 5 and 6 were again released as &quot;Švejk in Russian Captivity and Revolution&quot; (&quot;Švejk v Ruském zajetí a v revoluci&quot;), in two volumes or combined.

== Themes ==

The novel is set during World War I in Austria-Hungary, a multi-ethnic empire full of long-standing ethnic tensions. Fifteen million people died in the war, one million of them Austro-Hungarian soldiers, including around 140,000 who were Czechs. Hašek participated in this conflict and examined it in &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot;.

Many of the situations and characters seem to have been inspired, at least in part, by Hašek&#x27;s service in the 91st Infantry Regiment of the Austro-Hungarian Army. The novel also deals with broader anti-war themes: essentially a series of absurdly comic episodes, it explores the pointlessness and futility of conflict in general and of military discipline, Austrian military discipline in particular. Many of its characters, especially the Czechs, are participating in a conflict they do not understand on behalf of an empire to which they have no loyalty.

The character of Josef Švejk is a development of this theme. Through (possibly feigned) idiocy or incompetence, he repeatedly manages to frustrate military authority and expose its stupidity in a form of passive resistance: the reader is left unclear, however, as to whether Švejk is genuinely incompetent, or acting quite deliberately with dumb insolence. These absurd events reach a climax when Švejk, wearing a Russian uniform, is mistakenly taken prisoner by his own side.

In addition to satirising Habsburg authority, Hašek repeatedly sets out corruption and hypocrisy attributed to priests of the Catholic Church.

== Plot summary ==

The story begins in Prague with news of the assassination in Sarajevo that precipitates World War I.

Švejk displays such enthusiasm about faithfully serving the Austrian Emperor in battle that no one can decide whether he is merely an imbecile or is craftily undermining the war effort. He is arrested by a member of the state police, Bretschneider, after making some politically insensitive remarks, and is sent to prison. After being certified insane he is transferred to a madhouse, before being ejected.
Švejk gets his charwoman to wheel him (he claims to be suffering from rheumatism) to the recruitment offices in Prague, where his apparent zeal causes a minor sensation. He is transferred to a hospital for malingerers because of his rheumatism. He finally joins the army as batman to army chaplain Otto Katz. Katz was well able to avoid being sent to the front, managing to have a soft military job in Prague. 
However, Katz loses Švejk in a bet over a game of cards to Senior Lieutenant Lukáš, whose batman he then becomes — which would eventually lead him to the front.

Lukáš is posted with his march battalion to barracks in České Budějovice, in Southern Bohemia, preparatory to being sent to the front. After missing all the trains to Budějovice, Švejk embarks on a long on foot around Southern Bohemia in a vain attempt to find Budějovice, before being arrested as a possible spy and deserter (a charge he strenuously denies) and escorted to his regiment.

The regiment is soon transferred to Bruck an der Leitha, a town on the border between Austria and Hungary. Here, where relations between the two nationalities are somewhat sensitive, Švejk is again arrested, this time for causing an affray involving a respectable Hungarian citizen and engaging in a street fight. He is also promoted to company orderly.

The unit embarks on a long train journey towards Galicia and the Eastern Front. Close to the front line, Švejk is taken prisoner by his own side as a suspected Russian deserter, after arriving at a lake and trying on an abandoned Russian uniform. Narrowly avoiding execution, he manages to rejoin his unit. The unfinished novel breaks off abruptly before Švejk has a chance to be involved in any combat or enter the trenches, though it appears Hašek may have conceived that the characters would have continued the war in a POW camp, much as he himself had done.

The book includes numerous anecdotes told by Švejk (often either to deflect the attentions of an authority figure or to insult them in a concealed manner) which are not directly related to the plot.

== Selected characters ==
The characters of &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot; are generally either used as the butt of Hašek&#x27;s absurdist humour or represent fairly broad social and ethnic stereotypes found in the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the time. People are often distinguished by the dialect and register of Czech or German they speak, a quality that does not translate easily. Many German- and Polish-speaking characters, for example, are shown as speaking comedically broken or heavily accented Czech, while many Czechs speak broken German; much use is also made of slang expressions.

Some characters are to varying degrees based on real people who served with the Imperial and Royal 91st Infantry Regiment, in which Hašek served as a one-year volunteer. (Much research has been conducted into this issue and the results are part of the catalog of all 585 people, both real and fictitious, that appear in the novel.)

; Josef Švejk: The novel&#x27;s hero: in civilian life a dealer in stolen dogs. Based partly on František Strašlipka, the young batman to Oberleutnant Rudolf Lukas, Hašek&#x27;s company commander.
; Palivec: The foul-mouthed landlord of Švejk&#x27;s local pub – the &quot;U Kalicha&quot; (&quot;At the Chalice&quot;) on Na Bojišti street, Prague. Despite refusal to discuss any politics (&quot;it smells of Pankrác&quot;) Palivec is eventually arrested by Bretschneider (see below) after commenting that flies shit on the portrait of Franz Joseph in the pub.
; Police Agent Bretschneider: A secret policeman who repeatedly tries to catch Švejk and others out on their anti-monarchist views. He is eventually eaten by his own dogs, after buying a succession of animals from Švejk in an attempt to incriminate him.
; Staff Warder Slavík: A cruel and corrupt prison official (revealed to have himself ended up in prison under the Republic of Czechoslovakia).
; Military chaplain Otto Katz: Has a fondness for drinking, especially communion wine, and gambling. Švejk seems fond of Katz, but the latter loses the services of Švejk to Lieutenant Lukáš in a game of cards.
; Oberleutnant Lukáš: Švejk&#x27;s long-suffering company commander. A Czech from South Bohemia, Lukáš is something of a womanizer but is depicted in a broadly sympathetic manner by Hašek (the records of the real-life 91st Regiment show an Oberleutnant Rudolf Lukas – the same rank as the character – at the time of Hašek&#x27;s service; Hašek admired Lukas and even wrote him a number of poems. Lukas was Hašek&#x27;s company commander.) Though Švejk&#x27;s actions eventually lead to Lukáš&#x27; being labelled as a notorious philanderer in the Hungarian national press, he starts to miss Švejk after the latter is promoted to company orderly.
; Colonel Friedrich Kraus von Zillergut: An idiotic Austrian officer with a penchant for giving his colleagues long-winded, moronic explanations of everyday objects (such as thermometers and postage stamps) and situations; run over by a cart while attempting to demonstrate what a pavement is. Kraus&#x27;s dog is stolen by Švejk as a gift for Lukáš; the enraged colonel subsequently arranges Lukáš&#x27;s transfer to the front.
; Captain Ságner: One of the regiment&#x27;s professional officers and commander of Švejk&#x27;s march battalion; an ambitious careerist, he is later revealed to have been a closet Czech patriot in his youth. A Captain Vinzenz Sagner served in the 91st Regiment, where he was Hašek&#x27;s battalion commander.
; Colonel Schröder: The bad-tempered colonel of Švejk&#x27;s regiment, and a caricature of typical German-speaking senior officers of the Austrian army.
; Jurajda: The battalion&#x27;s spiritualist cook; before military service he had edited an &quot;occultist&quot; journal. Spends time attempting to avoid frontline service through letters he is writing to his wife, in which he details meals he is intending to cook for senior officers.
; 2nd Lieutenant Dub: Dub is a Czech schoolmaster, reserve officer, and commander of the battalion&#x27;s 3rd company: he has strongly monarchist views. As a conservative, pro-Habsburg Czech, Dub is the subject of some of Hašek&#x27;s most vicious satire. Repeatedly placed in humiliating situations, such as being found drunk in a brothel or falling off a horse. (In all Slavonic languages the word &quot;dub&quot; (&quot;oak&quot;) itself is a common synonym for a dull, idiotic person.) He is said to have been based on a lieutenant of the reserve, Mechálek, who served in Hašek&#x27;s regiment. The novel is ended by words of Lieutenant Dub: &quot;With the district governor, we always said: Patriotism, loyalty to duty, self-overcoming, these are the real weapons in war! I remember this especially today, when our troops will cross the border in the foreseeable future.&quot;
; Quartermaster Sergeant-Major Vaněk: Another recurring character, Vaněk (a chemist from Kralupy nad Vltavou in civilian life) is an example of an easy-going but self-serving senior NCO, whose main concern is to make his own existence as comfortable as possible. A Jan Vaněk served in Hašek&#x27;s regiment, and has some traits in common with the figure from the novel (domicile and occupation).
; Volunteer Marek: The character of one-year volunteer Marek is to some degree a self-portrait by the author, who was himself a one-year volunteer in the 91st. For example, Marek – like Hašek – was fired from the editorship of a natural history magazine after writing articles about imaginary animals. Marek is appointed the battalion historian by Ságner and occupies himself with devising memorable and heroic deaths in advance for his colleagues.
; First-Class Private Vodička: A sapper friend of Švejk noted mainly for his extreme hatred of Hungarians, which leads to an unfortunate incident in Bruck an der Leitha.
; Lieutenant Biegler (Cadet Biegler): Biegler is a young junior officer with pretensions to nobility, despite being the middle-class son of a furrier. Biegler takes his military duties so seriously that he is ridiculed even by his senior officers, and is mistakenly hospitalised as a &quot;carrier of cholera germs&quot; after medical staff misdiagnose (for army PR reasons) a cognac-induced hangover. Cadet Biegler also had a real-life model in the 91st regiment (Cadet Johann Biegler, later lieutenant).
; Captain Tayrle: The brigade adjutant and a particularly disgusting example of a headquarters officer, whose interests appear to lie mainly in crude jokes and sampling of local prostitutes.
; General Fink von Finkenstein: An aristocratic, vicious and near-insane senior Austrian officer and commander of the garrison fort of Przemyśl, Fink treats his men with extreme brutality. He almost succeeds in having Švejk executed after the latter is taken prisoner by his own side. His name and look in 1958 film is based on Prussian general Karl Fink von Finkenstein. 
; Chaplain Martinec: A chaplain plagued by drink-induced spiritual doubts, whose attempt to provide spiritual consolation to Švejk ends in disaster.
; &quot;Sergeant Teveles&quot;: A man in possession of a silver Military Merit Medal, purchased from a Bosnian, and claiming to be a Sergeant Teveles, who had previously disappeared along with the entire 6 March Company during fighting in Belgrade.
; Private Baloun: A miller from Český Krumlov in civilian life, and Švejk&#x27;s successor as Lukáš&#x27;s batman, Baloun is a glutton and is regularly punished for stealing Lukáš&#x27;s food. He eats raw dough, sausage skins, etc., when nothing else is available.

== Reviews ==
Bertolt Brecht expressed his view of &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot; thusly: “If anyone asks me to pick three literary works of this century which in my opinion will become part of world literature, then I would have to say one of them is Hašek’s The Good Soldier Švejk.”. John Willett wrote in his book &quot;The theatre of Bertolt Brecht&quot; (1959) the quoted statement was “an unpublished note”.

A number of literary critics consider &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot; to be one of the first anti-war novels, predating Erich Maria Remarque&#x27;s &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;. Joseph Heller said that if he had not read &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot;, he would never have written his novel &quot;Catch-22&quot;.

In his review, JP Stern described &quot;The Good Soldier Svejk&quot; as: 

Sue Arnold, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, stated: 

== Broader cultural influence ==
The seeming idiocy and suspected subversion of Švejk has entered the Czech language in the form of words such as &quot;švejkovina&quot; (&quot;švejking&quot;), &quot;švejkovat&quot; (&quot;to švejk&quot;), &quot;švejkárna&quot; (situational and systemic absurdity), etc. The name has also entered the English dictionary, in the form of &quot;Schweik&quot;, &quot;A person likened to the character of Schweik, pictured as an unlucky and simple-minded but resourceful little man oppressed by higher authorities,&quot; and the derivative forms &quot;to Schweik&quot;, &quot;Schweikism&quot;, and &quot;Schweikist&quot;.

In the British television documentary &quot;Hollywood&quot; (1979), a history of American silent films, director Frank Capra claimed the screen character of comedian Harry Langdon, which Capra helped to formulate, was partially inspired by &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot;.

At Prague&#x27;s NATO summit in 2002, a man dressed as the Good Soldier and using Svejk&#x27;s typical crutches to support himself, appeared at an anti-alliance protest, shouting at the top of his voice: &quot;To Baghdad, Mrs Muller, to Baghdad...&quot;, showing just how deep the character is etched on the Czech psyche.

== Adaptations and sequels ==
Švejk is the subject of films, plays, an opera, a musical, comic books, and statues, even the theme of restaurants in a number of European countries. The novel is also the subject of an unpublished operetta by Peter Gammond. Švejk has many statues and monuments, for example, at Humenné in Slovakia; Przemyśl and Sanok in Poland; St. Petersburg, Omsk, and Bugulma in Russia and Kyiv, Lviv, and Donetsk in Ukraine. In Kraków, there is a plaque on a building where the author was imprisoned for 7 days for vagrancy by the Austrian authorities. There has been speculation that Hašek got the idea for Švejk at that time, based on one of his fellow prisoners in the jail. The first statue of Švejk in the Czech Republic was unveiled in August 2014, in the village of Putim in South Bohemia.

== Translations ==
It is the most translated novel of Czech literature (58 languages in 2013). Excerpts from the first chapter, translated into German by Max Brod as &quot;Der Brave Soldat Schwejk&quot;, were published two days after Hašek&#x27;s death in the Prague German language paper &quot;Prager Tagblatt&quot; on January 5, 1923. Following Max Brod&#x27;s first steps toward a German translation, he introduced the book to Grete Reiner, executive editor of the anti-fascist magazine &quot;Deutsche Volkszeitung&quot;. Her translation of Švejk into German in 1926 was largely responsible for the speedy dissemination of Švejk&#x27;s fame across Europe. It was one of the books burned by the National Socialists in 1933. Her translation was said to be one of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s favourite books. Reiner was murdered in Auschwitz on 9 March 1944. After the war, many other translations followed and Švejk became the most famous Czech book abroad.

===English Translations===
3 English-language translations of &quot;Švejk&quot; have been published:

* &quot;The Good Soldier Schweik&quot;, tr. Paul Selver, 1930 (Abridged and bowderised)

# &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk and His Fortunes in the World War&quot;, tr. Cecil Parrott, 1973; reprints: .
# &quot;The Fateful Adventures of the Good Soldier Švejk During the World War&quot;, tr. Zdeněk &quot;Zenny&quot; K. Sadloň (and Book One collaborator Emmett Joyce), in three volumes: in 1997 Book One () and in 2009 Book Two () and Book Three &amp; Four ().
## &quot;The Fateful Adventures of the Good Soldier Švejk During the World War, Book One,&quot; &quot;The Centennial Edition,&quot; tr. Zdeněk &quot;Zenny&quot; K. Sadloň, 2024; (IngramSpark: ISBN 979-8218487089; Amazon: )

The first English translation, by Paul Selver, was heavily abridged, reducing the novel to about two thirds of its original length. Selver&#x27;s translation also bowdlerized the original text, omitting paragraphs and occasionally pages that may have seemed offensive; despite this he has been praised for preserving some of the tension in the work between Literary and Common Czech. Cecil Parrott, former British ambassador to Czechoslovakia, produced the first unabridged translation of the work. Parrott is a rather literal translator, sometimes unimaginatively so. This literalness and uncertain command of English slang registers sometimes leads Parrott into awkward-sounding English. The translation by Sadloň (and Book One collaborator Joyce) is the latest, an American translation by a native Czech speaker.

<text>Eduard Hanslick (11 September 18256 August 1904) was an Austrian music critic, aesthetician and historian. Among the leading critics of his time, he was the chief music critic of the &quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot; from 1864 until the end of his life. His best known work, the 1854 treatise &quot;Vom Musikalisch-Schönen&quot; (&quot;On the Musically Beautiful&quot;), was a landmark in the aesthetics of music and outlines much of his artistic and philosophical beliefs on music.

Hanslick was a conservative critic and championed absolute music over programmatic music for much of his career. As such, he sided with and promoted the faction of Robert Schumann and Johannes Brahms in the so-called &quot;War of the Romantics&quot;, often deriding the works of composers such as Franz Liszt and Richard Wagner. 

==Life and career==
Eduard Hanslick was born in Prague (then in the Austrian Empire), the son of Joseph Adolph Hanslik, a bibliographer and music teacher from a German-speaking family, and one of Hanslik&#x27;s piano pupils, the daughter of a Jewish merchant from Vienna. At the age of eighteen Hanslick went to study music with Václav Tomášek, one of Prague&#x27;s renowned musicians. He also studied law at Prague University and obtained a degree in that field, but his amateur study of music eventually led to writing music reviews for small town newspapers, then the &quot;Wiener Musik-Zeitung&quot; and eventually the &quot;Neue Freie Presse&quot;, where he was music critic until retirement. Whilst still a student, in 1845, he met with Richard Wagner in Marienbad; the composer, noting the young man&#x27;s enthusiasm, invited him to Dresden to hear his opera &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;; here Hanslick also met with Robert Schumann.
In 1854 he published his influential book &quot;On the Beautiful in Music&quot;. By this time his interest in Wagner had begun to cool; he had written a disparaging review of the first Vienna production of &quot;Lohengrin&quot;. From this point on, Hanslick found his sympathies moving away from the so-called &#x27;music of the Future&#x27; associated with Wagner and Franz Liszt, and more towards music he conceived as directly descending from the traditions of Mozart, Beethoven and Schumann — in particular the music of Johannes Brahms (who dedicated to him his set of waltzes opus 39 for piano duet). In 1869, in a revised edition of his essay &quot;Jewishness in Music&quot;, Wagner attacked Hanslick as &#x27;of gracefully concealed Jewish origin&#x27;, and asserted that his supposedly Jewish style of criticism was anti-German. It is sometimes claimed that Wagner caricatured Hanslick in his opera &quot;Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg&quot; as the carping critic Beckmesser (whose name was originally to be Veit Hanslich).

Hanslick&#x27;s unpaid lectureship at the University of Vienna led in 1870 to a full professorship in history and aesthetic of music and later to a doctorate &quot;honoris causa&quot;. Hanslick often served on juries for musical competitions and held a post at the Austrian Ministry of Culture and fulfilled other administrative roles. He retired after writing his memoirs, but still wrote articles on the most important premieres of the day, up to his death in 1904 in Baden.

==Views on music==

Hanslick&#x27;s tastes were conservative; in his memoirs he said that for him musical history really began with Mozart and culminated in Beethoven, Schumann and Brahms. He is best remembered today for his critical advocacy of Brahms as against the school of Wagner, an episode in 19th century music history sometimes called the War of the Romantics. The critic Richard Pohl, of the &quot;Neue Zeitschrift für Musik&quot;, represented the progressive composers of the &quot;Music of the Future&quot;.

Being a close friend of Brahms from 1862, Hanslick possibly had some influence on Brahms&#x27;s composing, often getting to hear new music before it was published. Hanslick saw Wagner&#x27;s reliance on dramatics and word painting as inimical to the nature of music, which he thought to be expressive solely by virtue of its form, and not through any extra-musical associations. On the other hand, he referred to extra-musicality when he asked, &quot;When you play Chopin&#x27;s mazurkas, do you not feel the mournful and oppressive air of the Battle of Ostroleka?&quot; (Hanslick 1848, p. 157). The theoretical framework of Hanslick&#x27;s criticism is expounded in his book of 1854, &quot;Vom Musikalisch-Schönen&quot; (&quot;On the Beautiful in Music&quot;), which started as an attack on the Wagnerian aesthetic and established itself as an influential text, subsequently going through many editions and translations in several languages. Other targets for Hanslick&#x27;s heavy criticism were Anton Bruckner and Hugo Wolf. Of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s Violin Concerto, he accused both Tchaikovsky and the soloist, Adolph Brodsky, of putting the audience &quot;through hell&quot; with music &quot;which stinks to the ear&quot;; he was also lukewarm towards the same composer&#x27;s Sixth Symphony.

Hanslick is noted as one of the first widely influential music critics. While his aesthetics and his criticism are typically considered separately, they are importantly connected. Hanslick was an outspoken opponent of the music of Liszt and Wagner, which broke down traditional musical forms as a means of communicating something extra-musical. His opposition to &quot;the music of the future&quot; is congruent with his aesthetics of music: the meaning of music is the form of music. It is along these lines that Hanslick became one of Brahms&#x27;s champions and often pitted him against Wagner.

<text>The Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata) is a duck native to the Americas, from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas and Mexico south to Argentina and Uruguay. The species has been domesticated, and feral Muscovy ducks can be found locally in New Zealand, Australia, the United States, and in Central and Eastern Europe.

It is a large duck, with the males about long, and weighing up to . Females are noticeably smaller, and only grow to , roughly half the males&#x27; size. The bird is predominantly black, with large white patches on the wing; the back feathers being iridescent and glossy in males, while the females are more drab. 

In feral birds with domesticated ancestry, the amount of white on the neck and head is variable, as well as the bill, which can be yellow, pink, black, or any mixture of these colors. It may have white patches or bars on the wings, which become more noticeable during flight. Both sexes have small red wattles around the bill, those of the male being larger and more brightly colored, and often considerably larger in feral birds.

Although the Muscovy duck is a tropical bird, it adapts well to cooler climates, thriving in weather as cold as and able to survive even colder conditions. In general, Barbary duck is the term used for &quot;C. moschata&quot; in a culinary context.

The domestic subspecies, &quot;Cairina moschata domestica&quot;, is commonly known in Spanish as the &quot;pato criollo&quot;. They have been bred since pre-Columbian times by Native Americans and are heavier and less able to fly long distances than the wild subspecies. Their plumage color is also more variable. Other names for the domestic breed in Spanish are &quot;pato casero&quot; (&quot;household duck&quot;) and &quot;pato mudo&quot; (&quot;mute duck&quot;).

== Description ==

All Muscovy ducks have long claws on their feet and a wide, flat tail. In the domestic drake (male), length is about and weight is , while the domestic hen (female) is much smaller, at in length and in weight. Large domesticated males often weigh up to , and large domesticated females up to .

The true wild Muscovy duck, from which all domestic Muscovies originated, is blackish, with large white wing patches. Length can range from , wingspan from and weight from . On the head, the wild male has a short crest on the nape. The bill is black with a speckling of pale pink. A blackish or dark red knob can be seen at the bill base, which is similar in colour to the bare skin of the face. The eyes are yellowish-brown. The legs and webbed feet are blackish. The wild female is similar in plumage, but much smaller, with a feathered face and lacking the prominent knob. The juvenile is duller overall, with little or no white on the upperwing.

Domesticated birds may look similar; most are dark brown or black mixed with white, particularly on the head. Other colors, such as lavender or all-white, are also seen. Both sexes have a nude black-and-red or all-red face; the drake also has pronounced caruncles at the base of the bill and a low erectile crest of feathers. &quot;C. moschata&quot; ducklings are mostly yellow with buff-brown markings on the tail and wings. For a while after hatching, juveniles lack the distinctive wattles associated with adult individuals, and resemble the offspring of various other ducks, such as mallards. Some domesticated ducklings have a dark head and blue eyes, others a light brown crown and dark markings on their nape. They are agile and speedy precocial birds.

The drake has a low breathy call, and the hen a quiet trilling coo.
The karyotype of the Muscovy duck is 2n=80, consisting of three pairs of macrochromosomes, 36 pairs of microchromosomes, and a pair of sex chromosomes. The two largest macrochromosome pairs are submetacentric, while all other chromosomes are acrocentric or probably telocentric for the smallest microchromosomes. The submetacentric chromosomes and the Z (female) chromosome show rather little constitutive heterochromatin (C bands), while the W chromosomes are at least two-thirds heterochromatin.
Male Muscovy ducks have helical penises that become erect to in s. Females have vaginas that coil in the opposite direction that appear to have evolved to limit forced copulation by males.

==Etymology==
===Common name &quot;Muscovy&quot;===

&quot;Muscovy&quot; is an old name for the region of Russia surrounding Moscow, but these ducks are neither native there nor were introduced there before they became known in Western Europe. It is not quite clear how the term came about; it very likely originated between 1550 and 1600, but did not become widespread until somewhat later.

In one suggestion, it has been claimed that the Company of Merchant Adventurers to New Lands traded these ducks to Europe occasionally after 1550; this chartered company became eventually known as the &quot;Muscovy Company&quot; or &quot;Muscovite Company&quot; so the ducks might thus have come to be called &quot;Muscovite ducks&quot; or &quot;Muscovy ducks&quot; in keeping with the common practice of attaching the importer&#x27;s name to the products they sold. But while the Muscovite Company initiated vigorous trade with Russia, they hardly, if at all, traded produce from the Americas; thus, they are unlikely to have traded &quot;C. moschata&quot; to a significant extent.

Alternatively—just as in the &quot;turkey&quot; (which is also from North America, not Turkey) and the &quot;guineafowl&quot; (which are not limited to Guinea)—&quot;Muscovy&quot; might be simply a generic term for an exotic place, in reference to the singular appearance of these birds. This is evidenced by other names suggesting the species came from lands where it is not actually native, but from where much &quot;outlandish&quot; produce was imported at that time (see below).

Yet another view—not incompatible with either of those discussed above—connects the species with the Muisca, a Native American nation in today&#x27;s Colombia. The duck is native to these lands also, and it is likely that it was kept by the Muisca as a domestic animal to some extent. It is conceivable that a term like &quot;Muisca duck&quot;, hard to comprehend for the average European of those times, would be corrupted into something more familiar. Likewise, the Miskito Indians of the Miskito Coast in Nicaragua and Honduras heavily relied on it as a domestic species, and the ducks as well may have been named after this region.

===Species name &quot;moschata&quot;===

Linnaeus’ description of &quot;Anas moschata&quot; only consists of a curt but entirely unequivocal &quot;[Anas] facie nuda papillosa&quot; (&quot;A duck with a naked and carunculated face&quot;), and his primary reference is his earlier work &quot;Fauna Svecica&quot;. But Linnaeus refers also to older sources, wherein much information on the origin of the common name is found.

Conrad Gessner is given by Linnaeus as a source, but the &quot;Historia animalium&quot; mentions the Muscovy duck only in passing. Ulisse Aldrovandi discusses the species in detail, referring to the wild birds and its domestic breeds variously as &quot;anas cairina&quot;, &quot;anas indica&quot; or &quot;anas libyca&quot; – &quot;duck from Cairo&quot;, &quot;Indian duck&quot; (in reference to the West Indies) or &quot;Libyan duck&quot;. But his &quot;anas indica&quot; (based, like Gessner&#x27;s brief discussion, ultimately on the reports of Christopher Columbus&#x27;s travels) also seems to have included another species, perhaps a whistling-duck (&quot;Dendrocygna&quot;). Already however the species is tied to some more or less nondescript &quot;exotic&quot; locality – &quot;Libya&quot; could still refer to any place in Northern Africa at that time – where it did not natively occur. Francis Willughby discusses &quot;The Muscovy duck&quot; as &quot;anas moschata&quot; and expresses his belief that Aldrovandi&#x27;s and Gessner&#x27;s &quot;anas cairina&quot;, &quot;anas indica&quot; and &quot;anas libyca&quot; (which he calls &quot;The Guiny duck&quot;, adding another mistaken place of origin to the list) refer to the very same species. Finally, John Ray attempts to clear up the confusion by providing an alternative explanation for the name&#x27;s etymology:
In English, it is called &quot;The Muscovy-Duck&quot;, though this is not transferred from Muscovia [the Neo-Latin name of Muscovy], but from the rather strong musk odour it exudes.

Linnaeus came to witness the birds&#x27; &quot;gamey&quot; aroma first-hand, as he attests in the &quot;Fauna Svecica&quot; and again in the travelogue of this 1746 Västergötland excursion. Similarly, the Russian name of this species, &quot;muskusnaya utka&quot; (Мускусная утка), means &quot;musk duck&quot; – without any reference to Moscow – as do the Bokmål and Danish &quot;moskusand&quot;, Dutch &quot;muskuseend&quot;, Finnish &quot;myskisorsa&quot;, French &quot;canard musqué&quot;, German &quot;Moschusente&quot;, Italian &quot;anatra muschiata&quot;, Spanish &quot;pato almizclado&quot; and Swedish &quot;myskand&quot;. In English, however, musk duck refers to the Australian species &quot;Biziura lobata&quot;.

===Genus name &quot;Cairina&quot;===
The currently assigned genus name Cairina, meanwhile, traces its origin to Aldrovandi and the mistaken belief that the birds came from Egypt: translated, the current scientific name of the Muscovy duck means &quot;the musky one from Cairo&quot;.

===Other names===
In some regions the name &quot;Barbary duck&quot; is used for domestic and &quot;Muscovy duck&quot; for wild birds; in other places, &quot;Barbary duck&quot; refers specifically to the dressed carcass, while &quot;Muscovy duck&quot; applies to living &quot;C. moschata&quot;, regardless of whether they are wild or domestic. In general, &quot;Barbary duck&quot; is the usual term for &quot;C. moschata&quot; in a culinary context.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

The species was first scientifically described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as &quot;Anas moschata&quot;, literally meaning &quot;musk duck&quot;. It was later transferred to the genus &quot;Cairina&quot;, making its current binomial name &quot;Cairina moschata&quot;.

The Muscovy duck was formerly placed into the paraphyletic &quot;perching duck&quot; assemblage, but subsequently moved to the dabbling duck subfamily (Anatinae). Analysis of the mtDNA sequences of the cytochrome &quot;b&quot; and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 genes, however, indicates that it might be closer to the genus &quot;Aix&quot; and better placed in the shelduck subfamily Tadorninae. In addition, the other species of &quot;Cairina&quot;, the rare white-winged duck (&quot;C. scutulata&quot;), seems to belong to a distinct genus (&quot;Asarcornis&quot;).

==Ecology==
This non-migratory species normally inhabits forested swamps, lakes, streams and nearby grassland and farm crops, and often roosts in trees at night. The Muscovy duck&#x27;s diet consists of plant material (such as the roots, stems, leaves, and seeds of aquatic plants and grasses, as well as terrestrial plants, including agricultural crops) obtained by grazing or dabbling in shallow water, and small fish, amphibians, reptiles, crustaceans, spiders, insects, millipedes, and worms. This is an aggressive duck; males often fight over food, territory or mates. The females fight with each other less often. Some adults will peck at the ducklings if they are eating at the same food source.

The Muscovy duck has benefited from nest boxes in Mexico, but is somewhat uncommon in much of the eastern part of its range due to excessive hunting. It is not considered a globally threatened species by the IUCN, however, as it is widely distributed.

===Reproduction===
This species, like the mallard, does not form stable pairs. They will mate on land or in water. Domestic Muscovy ducks can breed up to three times each year.

The hen lays a clutch of 8–16 white eggs, usually in a tree hole or hollow, which are incubated for 35 days. The sitting hen will leave the nest once a day from 20 minutes to one and a half hours, and will then defecate, drink water, eat and sometimes bathe. Once the eggs begin to hatch, it may take 24 hours for all the chicks to break through their shells. When feral chicks are born, they usually stay with their mother for about 10–12 weeks. Their bodies cannot produce all the heat they need, especially in temperate regions, so they will stay close to the mother, especially at night.

Often, the drake will stay in close contact with the brood for several weeks. The male will walk with the young during their normal travels in search for food, providing protection. Anecdotal evidence from East Anglia, U.K. suggests that, in response to different environmental conditions, other adults assist in protecting chicks and providing warmth at night. It has been suggested that this is in response to local efforts to cull the eggs, which has led to an atypical distribution of males and females, as well as young and mature birds.

For the first few weeks of their lives, Muscovy chicks feed on grains, corn, grass, insects, and almost anything that moves. Their mother instructs them at an early age how to feed.

===Feral bird===
Feral Muscovy ducks can breed near urban and suburban lakes and on farms, nesting in tree cavities or on the ground, under shrubs in yards, on apartment balconies, or under roof overhangs. Some feral populations, such as that in southern Florida, have a reputation of becoming pests on occasion. At night they often sleep at water, if there is a water source available, to flee quickly from predators if awakened. Small populations of Muscovy ducks can also be found in Ely, Cambridgeshire, Calstock, Cornwall, and Lincoln, Lincolnshire, U.K. Muscovy ducks have also been spotted in the Walsall Arboretum. There has been a small population in the Pavilion Gardens public park in Buxton, Derbyshire, for many years.

In the U.S., Muscovy ducks are considered a non-native species. An owner may raise them for food production only (not for hunting). Similarly, if the ducks have no owner, 50CFR Part 21 (Migratory Bird Permits) allows the removal or destruction of the ducks, their eggs and their nests anywhere in the United States outside of Hidalgo, Starr and Zapata Counties in Texas, where they are considered indigenous. The population in southern Florida is considered, with numbers in the several thousands, to be established enough to be considered &quot;countable&quot; for bird watchers.

Legal methods to restrict breeding include not feeding these ducks, deterring them with noise or chasing them away.

Although legislation passed in the U.S. prohibiting trade of Muscovy ducks, Fish and Wildlife Services intend to revise the regulations. They are not currently implementing them, though release of Muscovy ducks to the wild outside their natural range is prohibited.

==Domestication==
Muscovy ducks had been domesticated by various Native American cultures in the Americas when Columbus arrived in the Bahamas. A few were brought onto Columbus&#x27; ship the &quot;Santa Maria&quot;, they then sailed back to Europe by the 16th century.

The Muscovy duck has been domesticated for centuries, and is widely traded as &quot;Barbary duck&quot;. Muscovy breeds are popular because they have stronger-tasting meat—sometimes compared to roast beef—than the usual domestic ducks, which are descendants of the mallard (&quot;Anas platyrhynchos&quot;). The meat is lean when compared to the fatty meat of mallard-derived ducks, its leanness and tenderness being often compared to veal. Muscovy ducks are also less noisy, and sometimes marketed as a &quot;quackless&quot; duck; even though they are not completely silent, they do not actually quack (except in cases of extreme stress). Many backyard duck owners report that Muscovy ducks have more personality than mallard-derived ducks, often comparing them to dogs for their tameness and willingness to approach owners for food or stroking. The carcass of a Muscovy duck is also much heavier than most other domestic ducks, which makes it ideal for the dinner table.
Domesticated Muscovy ducks, like those pictured, often have plumage features differing from other wild birds. White breeds are preferred for meat production, as darker ones can have much melanin in the skin, which some people find unappealing.

The Muscovy duck can be crossed with mallards in captivity to produce hybrids known as mulards (&quot;mule ducks&quot;) because they are sterile. Muscovy drakes are commercially crossed with mallard-derived hens either naturally or by artificial insemination. The 40–60% of eggs that are fertile result in birds raised only for their meat or for production of foie gras: they grow fast like mallard-derived breeds, but to a large size like Muscovy ducks. Conversely, though crossing mallard-derived drakes with Muscovy hens is possible, the offspring are neither desirable for meat nor for egg production.

In addition, Muscovy ducks are reportedly crossbred in Israel with mallards to produce kosher duck products. The kashrut status of the Muscovy duck has been a matter of rabbinic discussion for over 150 years.

A study examining birds in northwestern Colombia for blood parasites found the Muscovy duck to be more frequently infected with &quot;Haemoproteus&quot; and malaria (&quot;Plasmodium&quot;) parasites than chickens, domestic pigeons, domestic turkeys and, in fact, almost all wild bird species also studied. It was noted that in other parts of the world, chickens were more susceptible to such infections than in the study area, but it may well be that Muscovy ducks are generally more often infected with such parasites (which might not cause pronounced disease, though, and are harmless to humans).

<doc id="364636" wikidata="Q6116416" url="?curid=364636" title="List of NBC television affiliates (by U.S. state)">
<text>The National Broadcasting Company ([[NBC]]) is an American broadcast television network owned by the NBCUniversal Filmed and Entertainment division of NBCUniversal, which originated as a radio network in November 1926 and expanded into television in April 1939. The network currently has 12 owned-and-operated stations, and current affiliation agreements with 223 other television stations.

This article is a listing of current NBC affiliates in the United States and U.S. possessions (including subchannel affiliates, satellite stations and select low-power translators), arranged alphabetically by state, and based on the station&#x27;s city of license and followed in parentheses by the Designated Market Area if it differs from the city of license. There are links to and articles on each of the stations, describing their histories, local programming and technical information, such as broadcast frequencies.

The station&#x27;s advertised channel number follows the call letters. In most cases, this is their virtual channel (PSIP) number.

Stations listed in boldface are owned and operated by NBC through its subsidiary NBCUniversal Owned Television Stations (excluding owned-and-operated stations of Telemundo, unless the station simulcasts a co-owned NBC O&amp;O station via a digital subchannel).

<text>Juan Laurentino Ortiz (June 11, 1896 - September 2, 1978) was an Argentine poet, born in the town of Puerto Ruiz, Entre Ríos Province. He died in Paraná, capital of the same province, at the age of 82.

He spent his childhood in the wilds of Montiel, a landscape that forever marked his poetry.

He studied philosophy and lived a short time in Buenos Aires, but soon returned to his province. Although he joined some political movements, he lived mostly isolated from the cultural climate of Argentina&#x27;s capital and only traveled abroad once at the invitation of the communist government of China.

His extensive work identified the mind with the landscape that surrounded him throughout his life in a &quot;splendid monotony&quot;. The image of his tall and thin figure in concentrated observation of the river scenery transcended his work and became a literary legend. &#x27;Juanele&#x27;, as he began to be called in the literary circles of the Argentinian capital, published his poems of long verses in lowercase typography, taking painstaking care of every aspect of the manuscript. As a result, these characteristics tended to be respected by his publishers in the published version of his poems.

The symbolism of French and Oriental poetry influenced his work, which was characterized by delicacy and a contemplative disposition which often referred to rivers, trees, floods, and the changes of the seasons without skirting the social history of his home province. At the same time, his poems exhibit a special sensitivity to the &quot;drama of poverty&quot; and, in particular, the suffering of innocent children. One of his well-known poems, &quot;The Gualeguay&quot;, is a narrative of both the landscape and historical and economic events that occurred on the banks of one of the rivers in the province.

<text>Israel Moiseevich Gelfand, also written Israïl Moyseyovich Gel&#x27;fand, or Izrail M. Gelfand (, , ; – 5 October 2009) was a prominent Soviet-American mathematician. He made significant contributions to many branches of mathematics, including group theory, representation theory and functional analysis. The recipient of many awards, including the Order of Lenin and the first Wolf Prize, he was a Foreign Fellow of the Royal Society and professor at Moscow State University and, after immigrating to the United States shortly before his 76th birthday, at Rutgers University. Gelfand is also a 1994 MacArthur Fellow.

His legacy continues through his students, who include Endre Szemerédi, Alexandre Kirillov, Edward Frenkel, Joseph Bernstein, David Kazhdan, as well as his own son, Sergei Gelfand.

==Early years==
A native of Kherson Governorate, Russian Empire (now, Odesa Oblast, Ukraine), Gelfand was born into a Jewish family in the small southern Ukrainian town of Okny. According to his own account, Gelfand was expelled from high school under the Soviets because his father had been a mill owner. Bypassing both high school and college, he proceeded to postgraduate study at the age of 19 at Moscow State University, where his advisor was the preeminent mathematician Andrei Kolmogorov. He received his PhD in 1935.

Gelfand immigrated to the United States in 1989.

==Work==
Gelfand is known for many developments including:

* the book &quot;Calculus of Variations&quot; (1963), which he co-authored with Sergei Fomin;
* Gelfand&#x27;s formula, which expresses the spectral radius as a limit of matrix norms.
* the Gelfand representation in Banach algebra theory;
* the Gelfand–Mazur theorem in Banach algebra theory;
* the Gelfand–Naimark theorem;
* the Gelfand–Naimark–Segal construction;
* Gelfand–Shilov spaces;
* the Gelfand–Pettis integral;
* the representation theory of the complex classical Lie groups;
* contributions to the theory of Verma modules in the representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras (with I. N. Bernstein and S. I. Gelfand);
* contributions to distribution theory and measures on infinite-dimensional spaces;
* the first observation of the connection of automorphic forms with representations (with Sergei Fomin);
* conjectures about the Atiyah–Singer index theorem;
* ordinary differential equations (Gelfand–Levitan theory);
* work on calculus of variations and soliton theory (Gelfand–Dikii equations);
* contributions to the &quot;philosophy of cusp forms&quot;;
* Gelfand–Fuchs cohomology of Lie algebras;
* Gelfand–Kirillov dimension;
* integral geometry;
* combinatorial definition of the Pontryagin class;
* Coxeter functors;
* general hypergeometric functions;
* Gelfand–Tsetlin patterns;
* Gelfand–Lokutsievski method;
* and many other results, particularly in the representation theory of classical groups.

Gelfand ran a seminar at Moscow State University from 1943 until May 1989 (when it continued at Rutgers University), which covered a wide range of topics and was an important school for many mathematicians.

==Influence outside mathematics==
The Gelfand–Tsetlin (also spelled Zetlin) basis is a widely used tool in theoretical physics and the result of Gelfand&#x27;s work on the representation theory of the unitary group and Lie groups in general.

Gelfand also published works on biology and medicine. For a long time he took an interest in cell biology and organized a research seminar on the subject.

He worked extensively in mathematics education, particularly with correspondence education. In 1994, he was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship for this work.

==Personal life==

Gelfand was married to Zorya Shapiro, and their two sons, Sergei and Vladimir both live in the United States. The third son, Aleksandr, died of leukemia. Following the divorce from his first wife, Gelfand married his second wife, Tatiana; together they had a daughter, Tatiana. The family also includes four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. Memories about I. Gelfand are collected at a dedicated website handled by his family.

Gelfand was an advocate of animal rights. He became a vegetarian in 1994 and vegan in 2000.

==Honors and awards==
Gelfand held several honorary degrees and was awarded the Order of Lenin three times for his research. In 1977 he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society. He won the Wolf Prize in 1978, Kyoto Prize in 1989 and MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1994. He held the presidency of the Moscow Mathematical Society between 1968 and 1970, and was elected a foreign member of the U.S. National Academy of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Royal Irish Academy, the American Mathematical Society and the London Mathematical Society.

In an October 2003 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, written on the occasion of his 90th birthday, Gelfand is described as a scholar who is considered &quot;among the greatest mathematicians of the 20th century&quot;, having exerted a tremendous influence on the field both through his own works and those of his students.

==Death==
Gelfand died at the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital near his home in Highland Park, New Jersey. He was less than five weeks past his 96th birthday. His death was first reported on the blog of his former collaborator Andrei Zelevinsky and confirmed a few hours later by an obituary in the Russian online newspaper &quot;Polit.ru&quot;.

<text>Sidney Arthur Lumet ( ; June 25, 1924 – April 9, 2011) was an American film director. Lumet started his career in theatre before moving to film, where he gained a reputation for making realistic and gritty New York dramas which focused on the working class, tackled social injustices, and often questioned authority. He received several awards including an Academy Honorary Award and a Golden Globe Award as well as nominations for nine British Academy Film Awards and a Primetime Emmy Award. 

He was nominated five times for Academy Awards: four for Best Director for the legal drama &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; (1957), the crime drama &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; (1975), the satirical drama &quot;Network&quot; (1976) and the legal thriller &quot;The Verdict&quot; (1982), and one for Best Adapted Screenplay for &quot;Prince of the City&quot; (1981). Other films include &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot; (1962), &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot; (1962), &quot;The Pawnbroker&quot; (1964), &quot;Fail Safe&quot; (1964), &quot;The Hill&quot; (1965), &quot;Serpico&quot; (1973), &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1974), &quot;Equus&quot; (1977), &quot;The Wiz&quot; (1978), &quot;The Morning After&quot; (1986), &quot;Running on Empty&quot; (1988) and &quot;Before the Devil Knows You&#x27;re Dead&quot; (2007). He received the Academy Honorary Award in 2004.

A member of the inaugural class at New York&#x27;s Actors Studio, Lumet started acting Off-Broadway and made his Broadway acting debut in the 1935 play &quot;Dead End&quot;. He went on to direct the Broadway plays &quot;Night of the Auk&quot; (1956), &quot;Caligula&quot; (1960) and &quot;Nowhere to Go But Up&quot; (1962). Lumet is also known for his work on television. He received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series nomination for &quot;NBC Sunday Showcase&quot; (1961). He also directed for &quot;Goodyear Television Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot; and &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Lumet was born in Philadelphia and grew up in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. He studied theater acting at the Professional Children&#x27;s School of New York and Columbia University.

Lumet&#x27;s parents, Baruch and Eugenia (née Wermus) Lumet, were Jewish and veterans of the Yiddish theatre; they had immigrated to the United States from Poland. His father, an actor, director, producer and writer, was born in Warsaw. Lumet&#x27;s mother, who was a dancer, died when he was a child. He had an older sister. Lumet made his professional debut on the radio at age four and his stage debut at the Yiddish Art Theatre at age five. As a child, he also appeared in many Broadway productions, including 1935&#x27;s &quot;Dead End&quot; and Kurt Weill&#x27;s &quot;The Eternal Road&quot;.

In 1935, aged 11, Lumet appeared in a Henry Lynn short film &quot;Papirossen&quot; (meaning &quot;Cigarettes&quot; in Yiddish), co-produced by radio star Herman Yablokoff. The film was shown in a theatrical play with the same title, based on the song &quot;Papirosn&quot;. The play and short film appeared at the Bronx&#x27;s McKinley Square Theatre. In 1939, at age 15, he made his only feature-length film appearance in &quot;...One Third of a Nation...&quot;.

World War II interrupted Lumet&#x27;s early acting career and he spent four years in the U.S. Army. After returning from service as a radar repairman stationed in India and Burma (1942–1946), he became involved with the Actors Studio, then formed his own theater workshop. He organized an Off-Broadway group and became its director, and continued directing in summer stock theatre while teaching acting at the High School of Performing Arts. He was the senior drama coach at the new 46th Street building of &quot;Performing Arts&quot;. The 25-year-old Lumet directed the drama department in a production of &quot;The Young and Fair&quot;.

===Early career===
Lumet began his directorial career with Off-Broadway productions and evolved into a highly efficient television director. He began directing television in 1950 after working as an assistant to friend and then-director Yul Brynner. He soon developed a &quot;lightning quick&quot; method for shooting due to the high turnover required by television. As a result, while working for CBS, he directed hundreds of episodes of &quot;Danger&quot; (1950–1955), &quot;Mama&quot; (1949–1957) and &quot;You Are There&quot; (1953–1957), the latter a weekly series that featured Walter Cronkite in one of his early television appearances. Lumet chose Cronkite for the role of anchorman &quot;because the premise of the show was so silly, was so outrageous, that we needed somebody with the most American, homespun, warm ease about him&quot;, he said.

He also directed original plays for &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot; and &quot;Studio One&quot;, directing approximately 200 episodes, which established him as &quot;one of the most prolific and respected directors in the business&quot;, according to Turner Classic Movies. His ability to work quickly while shooting carried over to his film career. Because the quality of many television dramas was so impressive, several of them were later adapted as motion pictures.
His first movie, &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; (1957), a courtroom drama centered on a tense jury deliberation that was based on a CBS live play, was an auspicious beginning for Lumet. It was a critical success and established him as a director skilled at adapting properties from other mediums to motion pictures. Fully half of Lumet&#x27;s complement of films originated in the theater.

Following his first film, Lumet divided his energies among political and social drama films, as well as adaptations of literary plays and novels, big stylish stories, New York-based black comedies and realistic crime dramas (including &quot;Serpico&quot; and &quot;Prince of the City&quot;). As a result of directing &quot;12 Angry Men&quot;, he was also responsible for leading the first wave of directors who made a successful transition from TV to movies.

A controversial TV show that he directed in 1960 gained some notoriety: &quot;The Sacco-Vanzetti Story&quot; on NBC. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the drama drew flack from the state of Massachusetts (where Sacco and Vanzetti were tried and executed) because it was thought to postulate that the condemned murderers were, in fact, wholly innocent. However, the resulting controversy did Lumet more good than harm, sending several prestigious film assignments his way.

He began adapting classic plays for both film and television, directing Marlon Brando, Joanne Woodward and Anna Magnani in the feature film &quot;The Fugitive Kind&quot; (1959), based on the Tennessee Williams play &quot;Orpheus Descending&quot;. He directed a live television version of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;The Iceman Cometh&quot;, which was followed by his film &quot;A View from the Bridge&quot; (1962), another psychological drama, from the play written by Arthur Miller. This was followed by another Eugene O&#x27;Neill play-turned-to-cinema, &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey into Night&quot; (1962), with Katharine Hepburn earning an Oscar nomination for her performance as a drug-addicted housewife; the four principal actors swept the acting awards at the 1962 Cannes Film Festival. 

==Directing style and subjects==
===Realism and energetic style===
Film critic Owen Gleiberman observed that Lumet was a &quot;hardboiled straight-shooter&quot; who, because he was trained during the Golden Age of Television in the 1950s, became noted for his energetic style of directing. The words, &quot;Sidney Lumet&quot; and &quot;energy&quot;, he added, became synonymous. &quot;The energy was there in the quietest moments. It was an inner energy, a hum of existence that Lumet observed in people and brought out in them...[when he] went into the New York streets...he made them electric.&quot; He also wrote:

===Collaboration===

&quot;Lumet generally insisted on the collaborative nature of the film, sometimes ridiculing the dominance of the &#x27;personal&#x27; director,&quot; wrote film historian Frank R. Cunningham. As a result, Lumet became renowned among both actors and cinematographers for his openness to sharing creative ideas with the writer, actors and other artists. Lumet &quot;has no equal in the distinguished direction of superior actors&quot;, added Cunningham, with many coming from the theater. He was able to draw powerful performances from actors, such as Ralph Richardson, Marlon Brando, Richard Burton, Katharine Hepburn, James Mason, Sophia Loren, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Blythe Danner, Rod Steiger, Vanessa Redgrave, Paul Newman, Sean Connery, Henry Fonda, Dustin Hoffman, Albert Finney, Simone Signoret and Anne Bancroft. &quot;Give him a good actor, and he just might find the great actor lurking within,&quot; wrote film critic Mick LaSalle.

When necessary, Lumet chose untrained actors, but he stated that &quot;over ninety percent of the time, I want the best tools I can get: actors, writers, lighting men, cameramen, propmen&quot;. Nonetheless, when he did use less experienced actors, he could still bring out superior and memorable acting performances. He did with Nick Nolte, Anthony Perkins, Armand Assante, Jane Fonda, Faye Dunaway, Timothy Hutton and Ali MacGraw, who referred to him as &quot;every actor&#x27;s dream&quot;. In Jane Fonda&#x27;s opinion, &quot;He was a master. Such control of his craft. He had strong, progressive values and never betrayed them.&quot;

Lumet believed that movies are an art, and &quot;the amount of attention paid to movies is directly related to pictures of quality&quot;. Because he started his career as an actor, he became known as an &quot;actor&#x27;s director&quot; and worked with the best of them over the years, a roster probably unequaled by any other director. Acting scholar Frank P. Tomasulo agreed and pointed out that many directors who are able to understand acting from an actor&#x27;s perspective were all &quot;great communicators&quot;.

According to film historians Gerald Mast and Bruce Kawin, Lumet&#x27;s &quot;sensitivity to actors and to the rhythms of the city have made him America&#x27;s longest-lived descendant of the 1950s Neorealist tradition and its urgent commitment to ethical responsibility&quot;. They cited his film &quot;The Hill&quot; (1965) as &quot;one of the most politically and morally radical films of the 1960s&quot;. They added that beneath the social conflicts of Lumet&#x27;s films lies the &quot;conviction that love and reason will eventually prevail in human affairs&quot;, and that &quot;law and justice will eventually be served – or not&quot;. His debut film &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot; was an acclaimed picture in its day, representing a model for liberal reason and fellowship during the 1950s. The film and Lumet were nominated for Academy Awards, and he was nominated for the Director&#x27;s Guild Award.

The &quot;Encyclopedia of World Biography&quot; states that his films often featured actors who studied &quot;Method acting&quot;, noted for portraying an earthy, introspective style. A leading example of such &quot;Method&quot; actors would be Al Pacino, who, early in his career, studied under Method acting guru Lee Strasberg. Lumet also preferred the appearance of spontaneity in both his actors and settings, which gave his films an improvisational look by shooting much of his work on location.

===Rehearsal and preparation===
Lumet was a strong believer in rehearsal and felt that if an actor rehearsed correctly, the actor would not lose spontaneity. According to critic Ian Bernard, Lumet felt that it gives actors the &quot;entire arc of the role&quot;, which gives them the freedom to find that &quot;magical accident&quot;. Director Peter Bogdanovich asked him whether he rehearsed extensively before shooting, and Lumet said that he liked to rehearse a minimum of two weeks before filming. During those weeks, recalls Faye Dunaway, who starred in &quot;Network&quot; (1976), he also blocked the scenes with his cameraman. As a result, she added that &quot;not a minute is wasted while he&#x27;s shooting, and that shows not only on the studio&#x27;s budget, but it shows on the impetus of performance&quot;. She praised his style of directing in &quot;Network&quot;, in which she won her only Academy Award:
Partly because his actors were well rehearsed, he could execute a production in rapid order, which kept his productions within their modest budgets. When filming &quot;Prince of the City&quot; (1981), for example, although there were over 130 speaking roles and 135 different locations, he was able to coordinate the entire shoot in 52 days. As a result, wrote historians Charles Harpole and Thomas Schatz, performers were eager to work with him, for they considered him to be an &quot;outstanding director of actors&quot;. The film&#x27;s star Treat Williams said that Lumet was known for being &quot;energetic&quot;:
Harpole added that &quot;whereas many directors disliked rehearsals or advising actors on how to build their character, Lumet excelled at both&quot;. He could thereby more easily give his performers a cinematic showcase for their abilities and help them deepen their acting contribution. Actor Christopher Reeve, who co-starred in &quot;Deathtrap&quot; (1982), also pointed out that Lumet knew how to talk technical language: &quot;If you want to work that way – he knows how to talk Method, he knows how to improvise, and he does it all equally well&quot;.

Joanna Rapf, writing about the filming of &quot;The Verdict&quot; (1982), states that Lumet gave plenty of personal attention to his actors, whether listening to them or touching them. She describes how Lumet and star Paul Newman sat on a bench secluded from the main set, where Newman had taken his shoes off, to privately discuss an important scene about to be shot. Lumet&#x27;s actors walked through their scenes before the camera rolled. This preparation was done because Lumet liked to shoot a scene in one take or two at the most. Newman liked to call him &quot;Speedy Gonzales&quot;, adding that Lumet did not shoot more than he had to. &quot;He doesn&#x27;t give himself any protection. I know I would,&quot; Newman said.

Film critic Betsey Sharkey agreed, adding that &quot;he was a maestro of one or two takes years before Clint Eastwood would turn it into a respected specialty&quot;. Sharkey recalls, &quot;[Faye] Dunaway once told me that Lumet worked so fast it was as if he were on roller skates. A racing pulse generated by a big heart.&quot;

===Character development===
Biographer Joanna Rapf observes that Lumet had always been an independent director, and liked to make films about &quot;men who summon courage to challenge the system, about the little guy against the system&quot;. This includes the women characters, as in &quot;Garbo Talks&quot; (1984). Its star Anne Bancroft embodied the kind of character portrayal that attracted him: &quot;a committed activist for all kinds of causes, who stands up for the rights of the oppressed, who is lively, outspoken, courageous, who refuses to conform for the sake of convenience, and whose understanding of life allows her to die with dignity ... &quot;Garbo Talks&quot; in many ways is a valentine to New York&quot;.

In an interview in 2006, Lumet said that he had always been &quot;fascinated by the human cost involved in following passions and commitments, and the cost those passions and commitments inflict on others&quot;. This theme is at the core of most of his movies, notes Rapf, such as his true-life films about corruption in the New York City Police Department or in family dramas such as &quot;Daniel&quot; (1983).

===Psychodramas===
Film historian Stephen Bowles believes that Lumet was most comfortable and effective as a director of serious psychodramas, as opposed to light entertainments. His Academy Award nominations, for example, were all for character studies of men in crisis, from his first film, &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot;, to &quot;The Verdict&quot;. Lumet excelled at putting drama on the screen. Most of his characters are driven by obsessions or passions, such as the pursuit of justice, honesty and truth, or jealousy, memory or guilt. Lumet was intrigued by obsessive conditions, writes Bowles.

Lumet&#x27;s protagonists tended to be antiheroes, isolated and unexceptional men who rebel against a group or institution. The most important criterion for Lumet was not simply whether the actions of the people are right or wrong, but whether they were genuine and justified by the individual&#x27;s conscience. Whistleblower Frank Serpico, for example, is the quintessential Lumet hero, who he described as a &quot;rebel with a cause&quot;.
An earlier example of psychodrama was &quot;The Pawnbroker&quot; (1964), starring Rod Steiger. In it, Steiger plays a Holocaust survivor whose spirit has been broken and who lives day-to-day as a pawn shop manager in Harlem. Lumet used the film to examine, with flashbacks, the psychological and spiritual scars with which Steiger&#x27;s character lives, including his lost capacity to feel pleasure. Steiger, who made nearly 80 films, said during a TV interview that the film was his favorite as an actor.

===Issues of social justice===
&quot;Serpico&quot; (1973) was the first of four &quot;seminal&quot; films that Lumet made during the 1970s that marked him as &quot;one of the greatest filmmakers of his generation&quot;. It was the story of power and betrayal in the New York City police force, with an idealistic policeman battling impossible odds.

Lumet was a child during the Depression, and grew up poor in New York City, witnessing poverty and corruption. It instilled in him at an early age a belief in the importance of justice for a democracy, a subject that he tried to put in his films. He admitted, however, that he did not believe that the movie business itself has the power to change anything. Rapf writes, &quot;There is, as he says, a lot of &#x27;shit&#x27; to deal with in the entertainment industry, but the secret of good work is to maintain your honesty and your passion.&quot; Film historian David Thomson writes of his films:

===New York City settings===
Lumet preferred to work in New York City and shunned the dominance of Hollywood. As a director, he became strongly identified with New York City. &quot;I always like being in Woody Allen&#x27;s world,&quot; he said. He claimed that &quot;the diversity of the City, its many ethnic neighborhoods, its art and its crime, its sophistication and its corruption, its beauty and its ugliness, all feed into what inspires him&quot;. He felt that in order to create, it is important to confront reality on a daily basis. For Lumet, &quot;New York is filled with reality; Hollywood is a fantasyland.&quot;

He often used New York City as the backdrop—if not the symbol—of his &quot;preoccupation with America&#x27;s decline&quot;, according to film historians Scott and Barbara Siegel. Lumet was attracted to crime-related stories in New York City urban settings, where the criminals get caught in a vortex of events that they can neither understand nor control but are forced to resolve.

===Use of Jewish themes===
Like other Jewish directors from New York, such as Woody Allen, Mel Brooks and Paul Mazursky, Lumet&#x27;s characters often speak overtly about controversial issues of the times. They felt unconstrained as filmmakers, and their art became &quot;filtered through their Jewish consciousness&quot;, wrote film historian David Desser. Lumet, like the others, sometimes turned to Jewish themes to develop ethnic sensibilities that were characteristic of American culture, by dynamically highlighting its &quot;unique tensions and cultural diversity&quot;. This was partly reflected in Lumet&#x27;s preoccupation with city life. &quot;A Stranger Among Us&quot; (1992), for example, is the story of a woman undercover police officer and her experiences in a Hasidic community in New York City.

The subject of &quot;guilt&quot;, explains Desser, dominates many of Lumet&#x27;s films. From his first feature film, &quot;12 Angry Men&quot; (1957), in which a jury must decide the guilt or innocence of a young man, to &quot;Q&amp;A&quot; (1990), in which a lawyer must determine the question of guilt and responsibility of a maverick policeman, guilt is a common thread that runs through many of his films. In &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1974), all of the suspects are guilty.

His films are also characterized by a strong emphasis on family life, often showing tensions within the family. This emphasis on the family included &quot;surrogate families&quot;, as in the police trilogy consisting of &quot;Serpico&quot; (1973), &quot;Prince of the City&quot; (1981), and &quot;Q&amp;A&quot;. An &quot;untraditional family&quot; is also portrayed in &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; (1975).

===Directing techniques===
Lumet preferred naturalism or realism, according to Joanna Rapf. He did not like the &quot;decorator&#x27;s look&quot;, for which the camera could call attention to itself. He edited his films so that the camera was unobtrusive. His cinematographer Ron Fortunato said, &quot;Sidney flips if he sees a look that&#x27;s too artsy.&quot; Lumet disliked CinemaScope and never filmed in an aspect ratio wider than 1.85:1.

Partly because he was willing and able to take on so many significant social issues and problems, he achieved strong performances from lead actors with fine work from character actors. He is &quot;one of the stalwart figures of New York moviemaking. He abides by good scripts, when he gets them,&quot; said critic David Thomson. Although critics gave varying opinions of his films, Lumet&#x27;s body of work is generally held in high esteem. Most critics have described him as a sensitive and intelligent director, having good taste, the courage to experiment with his style, and with a &quot;gift for handling actors&quot;.

In a quote from his book, Lumet emphasized the logistics of directing:
Critic Justin Chang adds that Lumet&#x27;s skill as a director and in developing strong stories continued up to his last film in 2007, writing of his &quot;nimble touch with performers, his ability to draw out great warmth and zesty humor with one hand and coax them toward ever darker, more anguished extremes of emotion with the other, was on gratifying display in his ironically titled final film, &quot;Before the Devil Knows You&#x27;re Dead&quot;&quot;.

===Vision of future films===
In an interview with &quot;New York&quot; magazine, Lumet said that he expects to see more directors from different ethnic backgrounds and communities telling their stories. &quot;You know, I started out making films about Jews and Italians and Irish because I didn&#x27;t know anything else.&quot;

==Personal life and death ==

Lumet was married four times; the first three marriages ended in divorce. He was married to actress Rita Gam from 1949 to 1955; to artist and heiress Gloria Vanderbilt from 1956 to 1963; to Gail Jones (daughter of Lena Horne) from 1963 to 1978; and to Mary Bailey Gimbel (ex-wife of Peter Gimbel) from 1980 until his death. He had two daughters by Jones: Amy, who was married to P.J. O&#x27;Rourke from 1990 to 1993, and actress and screenwriter Jenny, who had a leading role in his film &quot;Q&amp;A&quot;. She also wrote the screenplay for the film &quot;Rachel Getting Married&quot; (2008), as well as co-creating two television series with Alex Kurtzman: &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; sequel &quot;Clarice&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot;.

Lumet died from lymphoma at age 86 on April 9, 2011, in his residence in Manhattan. When asked in a 1997 interview about how he wanted to &quot;go out&quot;, Lumet responded, &quot;I don&#x27;t think about it. I&#x27;m not religious. I do know that I don&#x27;t want to take up any space. Burn me up and scatter my ashes over Katz&#x27;s Delicatessen.&quot; A few months after Lumet&#x27;s death, a retrospective celebration of his work was held at New York&#x27;s Lincoln Center with numerous speakers and film stars. In 2015, Nancy Buirski directed &quot;By Sidney Lumet&quot;, a documentary about his career that aired in January 2017 as part of PBS&#x27;s &quot;American Masters&quot; series.

== Recognition and legacy ==
According to film historian Stephen Bowles, Lumet succeeded in becoming a leading drama filmmaker partly because &quot;his most important criterion [when directing] is not whether the actions of his protagonists are right or wrong, but whether their actions are genuine&quot;. And where those actions are &quot;justified by the individual&#x27;s conscience, this gives his heroes uncommon strength and courage to endure the pressures, abuses, and injustices of others&quot;. His films have thereby continually given us the &quot;quintessential hero acting in defiance of peer group authority and asserting his own code of moral values&quot;.

According to &quot;The Encyclopedia of Hollywood&quot;, Lumet was one of the most prolific filmmakers of the modern era, directing, on average, more than one movie a year since his directorial debut in 1957. Turner Classic Movies notes his &quot;strong direction of actors&quot;, &quot;vigorous storytelling&quot; and the &quot;social realism&quot; in his best work. &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; film critic Roger Ebert described him as &quot;one of the finest craftsmen and warmest humanitarians among all film directors&quot;. Lumet was also known as an &quot;actor&#x27;s director&quot;, having worked with the best of them during his career, probably more than &quot;any other director&quot;. Sean Connery, who acted in five of his films, considered him one of his favorite directors, and one who had that &quot;vision thing&quot;.

Lumet&#x27;s published memoir about his life in film, &quot;Making Movies&quot; (1996), is &quot;extremely lighthearted and infectious in its enthusiasm for the craft of moviemaking itself&quot;, writes Bowles, &quot;and is in marked contrast to the tone and style of most of his films. Perhaps Lumet&#x27;s signature as a director is his work with actors – and his exceptional ability to draw high-quality, sometimes extraordinary performances from even the most unexpected quarters.&quot; Jake Coyle, a writer for the Associated Press, agreed: &quot;While Lumet has for years gone relatively underappreciated, actors have consistently turned in some of their most memorable performances under his stewardship. From Katharine Hepburn to Faye Dunaway, Henry Fonda to Paul Newman, Lumet is known as an actor&#x27;s director,&quot; and to some, like Ali MacGraw, he was considered &quot;every actor&#x27;s dream&quot;.

In the belief that Lumet&#x27;s &quot;compelling stories and unforgettable performances were his strong suit&quot;, director and producer Steven Spielberg described Lumet as &quot;one of the greatest directors in the long history of film&quot;. Al Pacino, on hearing of Lumet&#x27;s death, stated that with his films, &quot;He leaves a great legacy, but more than that, to the people close to him, he will remain the most civilized of humans and the kindest man I have ever known.&quot; &quot;Boston Herald&quot; writer James Verniere observed that &quot;at a time when the American film industry is intent on seeing how low it can go, Sidney Lumet remains a master of the morally complex American drama&quot;. Following his death, fellow New York directors Woody Allen and Martin Scorsese both paid tribute to Lumet. Allen called him the &quot;quintessential New York film-maker&quot;, while Scorsese said that &quot;our vision of the city has been enhanced and deepened by classics like &quot;Serpico&quot;, &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; and, above all, the remarkable &quot;Prince of the City&quot;&quot;. Lumet also drew praise from New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, who called him &quot;one of the great chroniclers of our city&quot;.

He did not win an individual Academy Award, although he did receive an Academy Honorary Award in 2005, and 14 of his films were nominated for various Oscars, such as &quot;Network&quot;, which was nominated for 10, winning 4. In 2005, Lumet received an Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement for his &quot;brilliant services to screenwriters, performers, and the art of the motion picture&quot;.

A few months after Lumet&#x27;s death in April 2011, TV commentator Lawrence O&#x27;Donnell aired a tribute to Lumet, and a retrospective celebration of his work was held at New York&#x27;s Lincoln Center, with the appearance of numerous speakers and film stars. In October 2011, the organization Human Rights First inaugurated its &quot;Sidney Lumet Award for Integrity in Entertainment&quot; for the TV show &quot;The Good Wife,&quot; along with giving awards to two Middle East activists who had worked for freedom and democracy. Lumet had worked with Human Rights First on a media project related to the depiction of torture and interrogation on television.

<doc id="364657" wikidata="Q3696673" url="?curid=364657" title="Mahuika crater">
<text>Mahuika crater was a hypothesized impact crater named after the Māori god of fire. It was described as being about 20 ± 2 km (12.4 ± 1.2 mi) wide and over deep and on the New Zealand continental shelf at 48.3 South and 166.4 East, to the south of The Snares. A 2017 survey of the purported site found no evidence supporting the existence of the crater.

==Initial claims of discovery==
The crater was reported and named by Dallas Abbott and her colleagues from the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University. Based on elemental anomalies, fossils, and minerals, which are interpreted to be derived from the impact, found in an ice core from the Siple Dome in Antarctica, it is argued that the impact which created the Mahuika crater occurred around 1443 AD, but other sources have placed the date as 13 February 1491 AD.

Some evidence suggests that the tsunami it caused was observed by Aboriginal Australians and entered into their oral traditions.

== Doubts over existence ==
In 2010 a paper was published in &quot;Marine Geology&quot; which critically analysed Abbott&#x27;s claims regarding the origin of the Mahuika crater. The researchers determined that there was no evidence to indicate a comet created the crater, and therefore the possibility of an impact causing the tsunami was highly unlikely. 

A 2017 survey by the NIWA research vessel, RV &quot;Tangaroa&quot;, using a multibeam echosounder and a sub-bottom profiling system show no evidence for any crater-like feature in the position reported by Abbott and her colleagues. Instead, the site is typical flat continental shelf lying in 160 meters (528 ft) of water. Subsequent bathymetric data compilation and analysis, as part of The Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project, shows no crater-life features on the continental shelf of southern New Zealand.

<doc id="364670" wikidata="Q216660" url="?curid=364670" title="Nepali Congress">
<text>The Nepali Congress ( ; abbr. NC) is a social democratic political party in Nepal and the largest party in the country. The party has 870,106 members as of the party&#x27;s 14th general convention in December 2021, making it the largest party by membership in Nepal. In June 2023, the party started online membership since the emergence of youth leaders in vital posts to attract youths to the party. The party is led by former prime minister, Sher Bahadur Deuba since the party&#x27;s thirteenth general convention in 2016. The party won 89 seats in the 2022 general election and is currently the largest parliamentary group in the House of Representatives.

There have been seven Nepali Congress prime ministers and the party has led the government fourteen times. Matrika Prasad Koirala, a founding member of the party was appointed as the first commoner prime minister following the end of the Rana regime in 1951. Subarna Shumsher Rana, another founding member of the party was appointed prime minister in 1958. Congress is the only party in Nepal to have been elected with a majority, with the party forming majority governments in 1959, 1991 and 1999 under B.P. Koirala, Girija Prasad Koirala and K.P. Bhattarai respectively with B.P. Koirala becoming the first elected prime minister of the country. The party also formed coalition governments in 1995 and 1998 with Girija Prasad Koirala and Sher Bahadur Deuba as prime ministers. The party emerged as the largest party following the 2013 Constituent Assembly elections and led a coalition government under Sushil Koirala. After the promulgation of the constitution in 2015, the party led coalition governments under Deuba in 2017 and 2021.

The party was formed in 1950 by the merger of the Nepali National Congress and the Nepal Democratic Congress along democratic socialist lines. NC prime ministers led four governments between the fall of the Rana dynasty and the start of the Panchayat era, including the first democratically elected government of Nepal, after the 1959 general election. Starting in the 1990s, the party followed other mainstream, centre-left social democratic parties in moving closer to the political centre through the Third Way.

== Background ==

In 1947, Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala, published an appeal for a unified struggle of Nepali people against the Rana regime. That same year, some Nepalese met in Benaras and formed an organization by the name All Indian Nepali National Congress () where an &quot;ad-hoc&quot; committee was established. The initial officers were chairman Devi Prasad Sapkota, vice-president Balchandra Sharma, general secretary Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, and public minister Gopal Prasad Bhattarai, publicity minister. Its Working Committee included Batuk Prasad Bhattarai, Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, and Narendra Regmi, while its coordinator was Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala.

Around the same time, Nepalese located in Calcutta formed another organization by the name All Indian Nepali Gorkha Congress () whose chairman was Dharma Narayan Pradhan. Koirala travelled extensively to places such as Benaras, Calcutta, Darjeeling, Assam, Bhaksu, and Dehradhun, and established contact with the Nepalese there. He met with Ganesh Man Singh during the same period. Nepalese representatives from different areas of Nepal and India organized one session in Calcutta. Koirala, Dilli Raman Regmi, Dharma Narayan Pradhan, and Dhan Man Singh Pariyar were present. In the same session, dropping &quot;Akhil Bharatiya&quot; from its name, the organization was named Nepali National Congress. Tanka Prasad Acharya, who was facing a life-sentence in Kathmandu, was made its chairman. The flag was square-shaped with white, blue, and red colors in succession, with the moon and the sun in its center.

The major four proposals passed by the session were to assist Indians in their independence movement, support Vietnam struggling for freedom against French colonization, ask for the immediate release of imprisoned members of the Nepal Praja Parishad, and initiate a non-violence movement in Nepal for the establishment of an accountable ruling system. The organization&#x27;s &quot;modus operandi&quot; was chosen, and attached itself to the civil conscience process in Nepal by establishing Tanka Prasad Acharya as its chairman.

== History ==
=== Nepali Congress formation, 1946–1950 ===
The Nepali Congress Party was formed by the merger of Nepali National Congress and Nepal Democratic Congress. The Nepali National Congress was founded by BP Koirala in Calcutta, India on 25 January 1946. The Nepal Democratic Congress was founded by Subarna Shumsher Rana in Calcutta on 4 August 1948. The two parties merged on 10 April 1950 to form the Nepali Congress and Koirala became its first president. The party called for an armed revolution against the Rana regime.

During the Bairgania Conference in Bairgania, Bihar, on 27 September 1950 the Nepali Congress announced an armed revolution against the Rana regime. The president of the party also announced the liquidation of operations in India and that the party would operate only inside Nepal.

After King Tribhuvan took refuge inside the Indian Embassy on 6 November 1950. The Congress Liberation Army decided to take this opportunity to launch attacks against the regime before the King &quot;left Nepalese soil&quot;. Matrika and Bisheshwor Prasad Koirala and Subarna Shamsher Rana flew to Purnia, Bihar. They called the commanders posted at different locations inside Nepal to prepare for armed strikes near the Nepal-India border.

On 11 November 1950, at midnight Birgunj was attacked, and by 12 November it fell to the Nepali Congress and the first &quot;People&#x27;s Government&quot; was declared. The liberation army was able to control most of the eastern hills of Nepal and the town of Tansen in Palpa. After pressure by the Indian government and the mass movement by the Nepali Congress and other political parties, the Rana government finally submitted to their demands and King Tribhuvan returned to the throne, replacing King Gyanendra, who had been crowned king after King Tribhuvan left for India.

=== Transitional government, 1951–1959 ===
After the fall of the Rana government, the Nepali Congress led three of the five governments formed before the elections. Matrika Prasad Koirala, the first commoner to become Prime Minister, led the government from 1951 to 1952 and 1953–1955 and Subarna Shamsher Rana led the government from 1958 to 1959. The much delayed elections were finally held in February 1959 and Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala became the first democratically elected Prime Minister of Nepal after the Nepali Congress won 74 of 109 seats in the parliament.

=== Panchayat government, 1960–1990 ===
Following a royal coup by King Mahendra in 1960, many leaders of the party, including Koirala, Rana and General Secretary Hora Prasad Joshi, were imprisoned or exiled; others took political refuge in India. Although political parties were prohibited from 1960 to 1989 and remained outlawed during the Panchayat system under the aegis of the Associations and Organizations (Control) Act of 1963, the Nepali Congress persisted. The party placed great emphasis on eliminating the feudal economy and building a basis for socioeconomic development. It proposed nationalizing basic industries and instituting progressive taxes on land, urban housing, salaries, profits and foreign investments. While in exile, the Nepali Congress served as the nucleus around which other opposition groups clustered and instigated popular uprisings in the Hill and Terai regions. During this time, the Nepali Congress refused the overtures of a radical faction of the Communist Party of Nepal for a tactical alliance.

The Nepali Congress demonstrated endurance, but defection, factionalism, and external pressures weakened it over time. Nevertheless, it continued to be the only organized party to press for democratization. In the 1980 government system referendum, it supported the multiparty system in opposition to the panchayat system. The party boycotted the 1981 general election and rejected the new government. The death in 1982 of Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala further weakened the party.

After the party boycotted the 1986 general election to the Rastriya Panchayat, its members were allowed to run in the 1987 Nepalese local elections. In defiance of the demonstration ban, the Nepali Congress organized mass rallies with the communist factions in January 1990 that ultimately triggered the pro-democracy movement.

=== Post-Panchayat government, 1991–2002 ===
After the Jana Andolan I, party president Krishna Prasad Bhattarai was invited to form an interim coalition government. In the 1991 general election, the Nepali Congress won 110 of 205 seats but Bhattarai lost his seat and yielded the position of prime minister to Girija Prasad Koirala who held his seat until 1994.

During the 1994 general election, the Nepali Congress lost its majority to Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist). The CPN (UML) lacked a majority and formed a minority government. After 46 parliamentarians from the CPN (UML) quit to form the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist–Leninist), the Nepali Congress formed their own government with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party and Nepal Sadbhawana Party. After CPN (UML) offered Lokendra Bahadur Chand the position of prime minister, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party led a government with the CPN (UML). Internal problems within the Rastriya Prajatantra Party caused one faction led by Surya Bahadur Thapa to lead a government with Nepali Congress and Nepal Sadbhawana Party.

Girija Prasad Koirala again became the Prime Minister in April 1998, leading a Congress minority government after Rastriya Prajatantra and Nepal Sadbhawana quit the government. Eventually, they got support from the CPN (ML) and after their withdrawal the CPN (UML) and Nepal Sadbhawana.
During the 1999 general election, Girija Prasad Koirala stepped aside in favour of Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, who returned as Prime Minister when the Nepali Congress won 111 out of 205 House seats. Bhattarai resigned as prime minister on 16 March 2000 after conflicts between himself and supporters of Girija Prasad Koirala. In the party&#x27;s first open leadership election, the parliamentarians selected Girija Prasad Koirala as their leader by 69-43 votes over Sher Bahadur Deuba. Accordingly, King Birendra designated Girija Prasad Koirala as prime minister on 20 March.

On 8 August 2000, Koirala dismissed the Minister of Water Resources, Khum Bahadur Khadka, for calling for Koirala&#x27;s resignation. Although Koirala beat back another challenge by Deuba&#x27;s supporters at a party convention in January 2001, he resigned as Prime Minister on 19 July. Deuba then defeated Secretary General Sushil Koirala, 72–40, for the party leadership and was designated prime minister by the king.

In May 2002, the party&#x27;s disciplinary committee expelled Deuba for failing to consult the party before seeking a parliamentary extension of the country&#x27;s state of emergency. Deuba&#x27;s supporters then expelled Koirala at a general convention in June. Deuba registered his faction as the Nepali Congress (Democratic), following a decision by the Election Commission that the Koirala faction held ownership of the name &quot;Nepali Congress&quot;, taking 40 of the party&#x27;s lower house representatives with him.

=== King Gyanendra&#x27;s rule, 2002–2006 ===

In the months following the King&#x27;s October 2002 decisions to dissolve the House of Representatives and replace Prime Minister Deuba with Rastriya Prajatantra&#x27;s Lokendra Bahadur Chand, the party joined the CPN (UML) and other, smaller parties in challenging the constitutionality of the moves. The party played a significant role in the formation of the Seven Party Alliance (SPA), which launched a series of street protests against the King&#x27;s regression. The Seven Party Alliance had earlier avoided the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) CPN-M and their violent methods, signed a 12-point understanding in Delhi in November 2005. The agreement contained three key commitmentsm, namely that the SPA endorsed CPN-M&#x27;s fundamental demand for elections to a constituent assembly; the Maoists reciprocated with an assurance that they accepted a multi-party system, which was the SPA&#x27;s prime concern. The SPA and the Maoists agreed to launch a peaceful mass movement against the monarchy.

=== Constituent Assembly, 2006–2015 ===
On 26 April 2006, the king reinstated the dissolved parliament and formed a small government under the premiership of Girija Prasad Koirala, the president of the Nepali Congress. In November 2006, the government and the CPN-M signed a Comprehensive Peace Accord in India and the Nepalese Civil War formally ended.

On 24 September 2007, the Nepali Congress (Democratic) and Nepali Congress unified as a single party with the 2008 Constituent Assembly election looming. Following the first Madhesh movement, former deputy speaker and senior leader of the party Mahantha Thakur, who had led a committee that held talks with the Madheshi Jana Adhikar Forum, broke away and formed the Terai Madhesh Loktantrik Party with other Madheshi leaders. Girija Prasad Koirala remained president of the newly unified party. The party placed second with 110 out of 575 elected seats in the Constituent Assembly election, winning only half as many seats as CPN-M.

The party joined the coalition government headed by Madhav Kumar Nepal in May 2009. Girija Prasad Koirala angered some in the party by nominating his daughter Sujata Koirala to be Foreign Minister. In June, in a contested election for leader of the party&#x27;s parliamentary group, Ram Chandra Poudel defeated Deuba. The 12th General Convention of the Nepali Congress was held in Kathmandu from 17 to 21 September 2010. The convention elected Sushil Koirala as the party president.
After the Constituent Assembly of Nepal was dissolved by Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai after failure to draft a new constitution before the deadline. In the resulting 2013 Constituent Assembly election, the party emerged as the largest party winning 196 of the 575 elected seats. Along with CPN (UML), under the leadership of Sushil Koirala, they formed a new coalition government. The new Constitution of Nepal was promulgated under his leadership on 20 September 2015.

=== Federal Nepal, 2015–2020 ===

Sushil Koirala resigned as prime minister on 10 October 2015 after losing support from CPN (UML). Nepali Congress joined the government again in August 2016 under the leadership of Bimlendra Nidhi, after backing Pushpa Kamal Dahal to become prime minister. According to their agreement, Dahal resigned on 24 May 2017 paving the way for Deuba to become prime minister for a fourth time on 6 June 2017.

On 22 April 2017, the Akhanda Nepal Party led by Kumar Kahadka joined the Nepali Congress ahead of the 2017 local elections. Nepali Congress won 11,456 seats including 266 mayoral or chairman positions. The party also won mayor posts in Lalitpur and Biratnagar. Ahead of the 2017 general and provincial elections, Nepal Loktantrik Forum led by former Nepali Congress leader, Bijay Kumar Gachhadar merged into the party. Similarly, a group from Federal Socialist Forum, Nepal led by MP Abhishek Pratap Shah, a group from CPN (UML) led by MP Mohan Singh Rathore and Rabin Chaudhary, a goroup from Rastriya Janata Party Nepal led by MP Jangi Lal Ray, a group from CPN (Maoist Centre) led by former Minister and MP Sambhu Lal Shrestha joined the party ahead of the 2017 election.

The party won 63 seats to the House of Representatives becoming the second largest party. The party could win only 23 seats under first past the post and many influential leaders including Ram Chandra Paudel, Ram Sharan Mahat, Bimalendra Nidhi, Krishna Prasad Sitaula, and Arjun Narsingh KC lost in their constituencies. The party won 113 seats in provincial assemblies and became the largest opposition in six out of seven provinces. The party won 13 seats in the 2018 National Assembly election. After the National Assembly election, Deuba resigned as prime minister on 15 February 2018, paving the way for a new government under CPN (UML). The party&#x27;s under performance in the election caused many elements inside the party to call for Deuba&#x27;s resignation. Prakash Man Singh stood against Deuba for the election of the parliamentary party leader, but Deuba won the vote 44–19.

=== Political crisis of 2020–2021 ===

Nepali Congress was back to centre of Nepalese politics since the political crisis 2020 which it had lost after deciding from the position of single largest party of nation. This happened after split in Nepal Communist Party and Janata Samajbadi Party due to personal interest and difference in ideology of core leaders.

The internal crisis led to dissolution of parliament (both house of representative and lower house of parliament) by Khadga Prasad Oli twice within six months. It was approved by the president but Supreme court denied the legality of such decision by Oli. After the supreme court&#x27;s historic decision, both the parliaments were reinstated.

After facing the vote for confidence in parliament, Oli lost the vote for confidence. Again he dissolved the parliament on 22 May 2021 and it was approved by president unanimously against the signatures submitted claiming majority to &quot;Nepali Congress&quot;. Still, 146 sitting members of HOR filed a case in supreme court against the decision and approval of president. Previously, they had submitted majority signatures to president asking to appoint Sher Bahadur Deuba as the next prime-minister of Nepal. On 12 July 2021, the Supreme Court stated the decision of parliament dissolution was unlawful. Similarly, it ordered the appointment Deuba as the next Prime Minister of Nepal citing article 76(5) of the Constitution of Nepal within 28 hours. It stated that the decision made by the president was against the norms of the constitution. On 13 July 2021, President Bidya Devi Bhandari appointed Sher Bahadur Deuba as the Prime Minister without including any article of Constitution and stating as per the order of Court. This created cold dispute and people alleged President Bhandari of forgetting her limits and being tilted to ex-PM Oli. After Deuba declined to take the oath as per the appointment letter, the letter was changed and stated that Deuba was made PM in accordance with article 76(5), marking Deuba&#x27;s fifth term as PM.

This process of vote of confidence was keenly watched by people from within and outside the country. On 18 July 2021, Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs of Nepal and Nepali Congress leader Gyanendra Bahadur Karki registered a proposal for vote of confidence in the first meeting of reinstated House of Representatives. Here, CPN(UML) got divided when only 69% MP from UML voted against Deuba. People&#x27;s Socialist Party, Nepal remained united in voting for the Deuba despite ongoing process of party division. Hence, the government got vote of confidence with no party purely as opposition, a first in the history of Nepal.

Out of total 249 present for the vote, 165 voted for Deuba while 1 remained undecided. This includes 83 from CPN (UML) who voted against Deuba. 37 of them were either absent or voted in favour of Deuba. 22 MPs from Madhav Nepal faction and some rebel from Oli faction from CPN (UML) voted for Deuba. This was a historic win with nearly 66.3% of votes of total present in parliament. It was totally unexpected with just 61 voters from Nepali Congress. It was a big set back to Oli when 38 CPN (UML) MPs did not vote against Deuba. This was seen as a result of Oli&#x27;s &quot;autocratic&quot; rule and dissolution of the house twice.

In addition to this, Nepali Congress joined the government of Karnali on 6 June with an agreement of a roatational government. Within a week, Congress also joined the Province No. 2 government, as a result of an internal split in PSPN. Similarly, on 12 June Congress formed a coalition government Gandaki under its own leadership. On 12 August, Congress joined a coalition government in Lumbini formed under the leadership of CPN (Maoist Centre), with a provision of rotational government to be formed in the next few months. On 3 November 2021, Nepali Congress formed Karnali government under its own leadership sworning Jeevan Bahadur Shahi as chief minister of the province.
From 13 to 15 December 2021, Nepali Congress conducted its 14th general convention in the presence of 850,000 active members and nearly 5,000 candidates, re-electing Sher Bahadur Deuba as party president in the second round. The party elected Purna Bahadur Khadka and Dhanraj Gurung vice-presidents of the party. Popular youth leaders Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma were elected to the executive post of general secretary of the party.

=== Nepalese election year, 2022–present ===
On 13 May 2022, the Sher Bahadur Deuba-led government held local level elections, in which the ruling Nepali Congress swept the polls winning the posts of chiefs in 329 local units out of a total of 753, up from 266 in the last local elections held in 2017. The party secured wins in two metropolitan cities, Lalitpur and Biratnagar, as well as wins in four sub-metropolitan cities of Butwal, Nepalgunj, Janakpur and Itahari. The NC secured the highest vote among contesting parties in the elections.

On 20 November 2022, the Sher Bahadur Deuba-led government held general elections, in which the ruling Nepali Congress emerged as the single largest party at both national and provincial level winning as much as 57 seats of 90 seats it had contested.

== Ideology ==

The party was founded on the principle of democracy and socialism. In 1956, the party adopted democratic socialism as its ideology for socio-economic transformation. Its foreign policy orientation was to nonalignment and good relations with India. It initially favoured mainstream social democratic policies, but in the late 20th century, began moving closer to the political centre, starting in the 1990s, abandoning some of its previous social democratic policies in favour of those similar to the Third Way.

== Organization ==
=== Central Organization ===
The National Convention remains the supreme body of Nepali Congress and it is organized every four years by the party&#x27;s Central Committee. The national convention elects the party portfolios including the party chair, two deputy chairs, two general secretaries each along with eight deputy general secretaries from different cluster. It also elects central committee members. The convention also discusses and approves political documents, organizational proposals and amendments to the party constitution. The party has also provision for Central Working committee.

=== Provincial and local organization ===
Party committees exist at the provincial, district, constituency, local and ward level. All the level of committee holds a convention every four years. The party has distributed a number of rights at different levels per the current Constitution of Nepal. Nepali Congress stands as the only party to have conducted conventions at all levels since the promulgation of current constitution of Nepal. The convention elects the leadership and members of the committee which is the supreme decision making body in between conventions.

<text>Viborg and Nyslott County (, ) was a county of the Swedish Empire from 1634 to 1721. The county was named after the castle towns of Viborg () and Nyslott (, literally &quot;New Castle&quot;), today located in the towns of Vyborg in Russia and Savonlinna in Finland.

The county was established in 1634 as Karelia County (, ), but in 1641 Nyslott County (, ) was broken out and made a separate entity. Remainder of Karelia County was now called Viborg County. In 1650 the counties were joined again as the Viborg and Nyslott County.

Following the Great Northern War southeastern parts of the county were ceded to Russia in 1721, and the territory that remained was reconstituted into the County of Kymmenegård and Nyslott (, ), with the northern and western parts of County of Kexholm. In 1743 following a new conflict part of this county was also ceded to Russia in the Treaty of Åbo. The ceded parts of the County of Viborg and Nyslott and the County of Kexholm were at first part of the Saint Petersburg Governorate, but in 1744 they were reconstituted with new conquests into the Russian Vyborg Governorate, which also became known as &quot;Old Finland&quot;. Remainder of the County of Kymmenegård and Nyslott was joined with some parts of the County of Nyland and Tavastehus in 1747 into the County of Savolax and Kymmenegård.

After the Russian victory in the Finnish War in 1809, Sweden ceded all its territory in Finland to Russia by the Treaty of Fredrikshamn. As part of Russian Empire Finland became to constitute a separate grand duchy. In 1812 Russia made the territories of Vyborg Governorate part of the new Grand Duchy of Finland as Viipuri Province.

<text>Kexholm County (, ) was a county of the Swedish Empire from 1634 to 1721, when the southern part was ceded to the Russian Empire in the Treaty of Nystad. The capital of the county was Kexholm (), which today is Priozersk.

==History==
The county was ceded to Sweden by Russia together with Ingria by the Treaty of Stolbovo in 1617. The county extended to the parishes of Lieksa in the north and of Suojärvi in the east. In the south and west, the county was bordered by Viborg and Nyslott County.

Following the Great Northern War, southern and eastern parts were ceded to Russia in 1721, and the territory that remained was reconstituted into the County of Kymmenegård and Nyslott (, ), with the remainder of the Viborg and Nyslott County. In 1743 following a new conflict part of this county was also ceded to Russia in the Treaty of Åbo. The ceded parts of the County of Viborg and Nyslott and the County of Kexholm were at first part of the Saint Petersburg Governorate, but in 1744 they were reconstituted with new conquests into the Russian Vyborg Governorate, which also became known as &quot;Old Finland&quot;. Remainder of the County of Kymmenegård and Nyslott was joined with some parts of the County of Nyland and Tavastehus in 1747 into the County of Savolax and Kymmenegård.

<text>Nyland and Tavastehus County (, ) was a county of the Swedish Empire in Finland from 1634 to 1809.

In 1775 whole northern part of the county (later Central Finland region) was transferred to the new Vasa County. Also a part of historical Satakunta was added to the Nyland and Tavastehus County from the Åbo and Björneborg County, while Upper Hollola was transferred to the new Kymmenegård County.

By the Treaty of Fredrikshamn in 1809 Sweden ceded all its territories in Finland, east of the Torne River, to Russia. The county still continued to exist as a province of the new autonomic Grand Duchy of Finland until 1831, when it was split to Häme Province and Uusimaa Province.

<text>A trade card is a small card, similar to a visiting card, formerly distributed to advertise businesses. Larger than modern business cards, they could be rectangular or square, and often featured maps useful for locating a business in the days before house numbering. They first became popular at the end of the 17th century in Paris, Lyon and London.

==Definition==
The term, trade card, refers to a varied group of items made of paper or of card of varying sizes and shapes. Trade cards evolved in different ways in Britain, America and Europe, giving rise to wide variation in their format and design. The characteristic features of a trade card are that it is a small printed item, used by merchants and traders to give to their customers for their use as an aid to memory. Trade cards were sufficiently small so that they could be carried in the gentleman&#x27;s pocket or lady&#x27;s purse.

==History==

In its original sense, the &quot;trade&quot; in &quot;trade card&quot; refers to its use by the proprietor of a business to announce his trade, or line of business. Trade cards were widely used by retailers and tradesmen from around the late 17th century in Paris, Lyon and London. In the period before mass media, they functioned as advertising and also as maps, directing the public to the merchants&#x27; stores (no formal street address numbering system existed at the time). The trade card is an early example of the modern business card. The use of trade cards in America became widespread from the mid-19th century in the period following the Civil war.

The earliest trade cards were not cards at all, instead they were printed on paper and did not include illustrations. Later they were printed on the more substantial card and typically bore the tradesmen&#x27;s name and address, and before street numbering was in common use, often included a long-winded set of directions on how to locate the store or premises. With the advent of commercial engraving and lithography, illustrations became a standard feature of even the most humble trade card. Eventually trade cards evolved into business cards, which are still in use today.

Eighteenth century traders wanted cards with impact and sophistication. Accordingly, they often hired notable designers and engravers to design their cards. In 1738, for instance, when leading Parisian art dealer Edme-François Gersaint changed the name of his business to &quot;A la Pagode&quot;, he hired the engraver, François Boucher to design his card. In 1767, the French painter Gabriel de Saint-Aubin designed a trade card for &quot;quincailler&quot; (ironmonger), Perier, whose premises were situated at the sign of the Moor&#x27;s Head on the Quai de la Megisserie in Paris. Other artists who accepted commissions for trade cards included: Hogarth, Bartolozzi and Bewick. The demand for trade cards, and also for catalogs fuelled demand for creative services such as etching, engraving and print-making in the first half of the eighteenth century.

Examples of early trade cards
Fuelled by the advent of color lithography and multi-color printing, trade cards entered their heyday in the late 19th century. Businesses began to create increasingly sophisticated designs, using color printing. A few American companies specialized in producing stock cards, usually with an image on one side and space on the other side for the business to add its own information. In around 1850, Aristide Boucicaut, the founder of the department store &quot;Au Bon Marché&quot; used color printing to great effect when he seized on the idea of using the new chromolithography to offer a weekly advertising color print to children accompanied by their parents. This plan was so successful that it was soon emulated by other Parisian department stores. Cards for &quot;La Belle Jardiniére&quot; and &quot;La Galerie Lafayette&quot; soon followed.

The attractive and colorful designs spawned a passion for collecting trade cards, which became a popular hobby in the late 19th century. By moving into the realm of collecting, trade cards gave rise to the trading card, the meaning now shifting to the exchange or trade of cards by enthusiasts. Some cards, particularly those produced by tobacco companies featuring baseball players, later developed into collectibles and lost their function as a business advertisement.

The interest in collecting trade cards has ensured that many examples have survived. Collections of rare trade cards, dating from the 17th century to the 19th century can be found at the British Library, Bodleian Library, Oxford, and Waddesdon Manor, Buckinghamshire. Another important collection of medical trade cards is the Wellcome Collection.

<text>A visiting card, also called a calling card, was a small, decorative card that was carried by individuals to present themselves to others. It was a common practice in the 18th and 19th century, particularly among the upper classes, to leave a visiting card when calling on someone (which means to visit their house or workplace).

Before the 18th century, visitors making social calls left handwritten notes at the home of friends who were not at home. By the 1760s, the upper classes in France and Italy were leaving printed visiting cards decorated with images on one side and a blank space for hand-writing a note on the other. The style quickly spread across Europe and to the United States. As printing technology improved, elaborate color designs became increasingly popular. However, by the late 1800s, simpler styles became more common.

By the 19th century, men and women needed personalized calling or visiting cards to maintain their social status or to move up in society. These small cards, about the size of a modern-day business card, usually featured the name of the owner, and sometimes an address. Calling cards were left at homes, sent to individuals, or exchanged in person for various social purposes. Knowing and following calling card &quot;rules&quot; signalled one&#x27;s status and intentions.

==History==

Visiting cards became an indispensable tool of etiquette, with sophisticated rules governing their use. The essential convention was that a first person would not expect to see a second person in the second&#x27;s own home (unless invited or introduced) without having first left his visiting card at the second&#x27;s home. Upon leaving the card, the first would not expect to be admitted initially but instead might receive a card at his own home in response from the second. This would serve as a signal that a personal visit and meeting at home would be welcome. On the other hand, if no card was forthcoming, or if a card was sent in an envelope, a personal visit was thereby discouraged.

As an adoption from France, they were called from 1615 to 1800 and then became &quot;carte de visite&quot; or with the advent of photography in the mid-19th century. Photographic &quot;cartes de visite&quot; or &quot;CdVs&quot; were not generally used as calling cards: they did not have the owner/sitter&#x27;s name printed on them, since they were normally given to family and close friends, or were of celebrities.

Visiting cards became common among the aristocracy of Europe, and also in the United States. The whole procedure depended upon there being servants to open the door and receive the cards and it was, therefore, confined to the social classes which employed servants.

If a card was left with a turned corner it indicated that the card had been left in person rather than by a servant.

Some visiting cards included refined engraved ornaments, embossed lettering, and fantastic coats of arms. However, the standard form of visiting card in the 19th century in the United Kingdom was a plain card with nothing more than the bearer&#x27;s name on it. Sometimes the name of a gentlemen&#x27;s club might be added, but addresses were not otherwise included. Visiting cards were kept in highly decorated card cases.

The visiting card is no longer the universal feature of upper-middle-class and upper-class life that it once was in Europe and North America. Much more common is the business card, in which contact details, including address and telephone number, are essential. This has led to the inclusion of such details even on modern domestic visiting cards: &quot;Debrett&#x27;s New Etiquette&quot; in 2007 endorsed the inclusion of private and club addresses (at the bottom left and right respectively) but states the inclusion of a telephone or fax number would be &quot;a &quot; (blunder).

According to &quot;Debrett&#x27;s Handbook&quot; in 2016, a gentleman&#x27;s card would traditionally give his title, rank, private or service address (bottom left), and club (bottom right) in addition to his name. Titles of peers are given with no prefix (e.g. simply &quot;Duke of Wellington&quot;), courtesy titles are similarly given as &quot;Lord John Smith&quot;, etc., but &quot;Hon&quot; (for &quot;the Honourable&quot;) are not used (Mr, Ms, etc. being used instead). Those without titles of nobility or courtesy titles may use ecclesiastical titles, military ranks, &quot;Professor&quot; or &quot;Dr&quot;, or Mr, Ms, etc. For archbishops, bishops, deans, and archdeacons, the territorial title is used (e.g. &quot;The Bishop of London&quot;). Men may use their forenames or initials, while a married or widowed woman may either use her husband&#x27;s name (the traditional usage) or her own. The only post-nominal letters used are those indicating membership of the armed forces (e.g. &quot;Captain J. Smith, RN&quot;). The &quot;Social Card&quot;, which is a modern version of the visiting card, features a person&#x27;s name, mobile phone number, and email address, with an optional residential address rarely included; family social cards include the names of parents and children.

== For dating ==
As of 2010,
Business-style cards called calling cards are also used by some for dating. These cards typically have the bearer&#x27;s name, their contact information, and may also feature a humorous quote or piece of information about the individual.

<doc id="364716" wikidata="Q1617928" url="?curid=364716" title="Highgrove House">
<text>Highgrove House was the family residence of King Charles III and Queen Camilla. It lies southwest of Tetbury in Gloucestershire, England. Built in the late 18th century, Highgrove and its estate were owned by various families until it was purchased in 1980 by the Duchy of Cornwall from Maurice Macmillan. Charles III remodelled the Georgian house with neo-classical additions in 1987. The duchy manages the estate and the nearby Duchy Home Farm.

The gardens at Highgrove have been open to the public since 1996. The gardens of the late-18th-century home were overgrown and untended when Charles first moved in but have since flourished and now include rare trees, flowers and heirloom seeds. Current organic gardening and organic lawn management techniques have allowed the gardens to serve also as a sustainable habitat for birds and wildlife. The gardens were designed by Charles in consultation with highly regarded gardeners like Rosemary Verey and naturalist Miriam Rothschild.

The gardens receive more than 30,000 visitors a year. The house and gardens are run according to the King&#x27;s environmental principles and have been the subject of several books and television programmes. The King frequently hosts charitable events at the house.

As the property is owned by the Duchy of Cornwall, control of the House was transferred to William, Prince of Wales, when his father acceded to the throne and he became Duke of Cornwall on 8 September 2022. The King rents the house from the Duchy to use as a country residence.

==Location==

Highgrove House is in Doughton in the civil parish of Tetbury Upton, near Tetbury in the county of Gloucestershire in South West England. Gatcombe Park, the country residence of the King&#x27;s sister, Anne, Princess Royal, is away, between the villages of Minchinhampton and Avening. In addition, the King&#x27;s cousin, Prince Michael of Kent, bought nearby Nether Lypiatt Manor shortly after the duchy purchased Highgrove, although he sold it in 2006.

As the country residence of the King, Highgrove House is well protected by security. The house is one of several sites designated under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 that are protected by law from criminal trespass, a high stone wall surrounds the estate, and in 1983 the duchy and the chief constable of Gloucestershire supported the moving, for security reasons, of two public footpaths that ran close to the house. Several people have been arrested near Highgrove since the King&#x27;s occupation, including two French journalists and a photographer from &quot;The Sun&quot;. A aerial exclusion zone for civilian aircraft and microlights was imposed over Highgrove in 1991.

Highgrove House was built in 1796 to 1798 by John Paul Paul, and believed to have been designed by architect Anthony Keck. The estate itself came to the family through the marriage in 1771 of Josiah Paul Tippetts later Paul (his mother&#x27;s family name, which he adopted under the terms of the will of his uncle, her brother) with Mary Clark, whose father Robert was the local squire. It belonged to Paul&#x27;s descendants until 1860. In 1850 his granddaughter Mary Elizabeth Paul died after her gown caught fire during a soiree held for her brother in the ballroom. The house was sold again in 1864 to a barrister, William Yatman. During his time at Highgrove, Yatman was described as one of the &quot;chief preservers of foxes&quot; in an 1872 discussion on the Duke of Beaufort&#x27;s hounds. Yatman rebuilt the medieval spire of Tetbury Church in memory of his son, and paid for the rehanging of the church bells in 1891. Yatman left Highgrove following a fire in 1893 which destroyed much of the interiors of the house. The house was rebuilt at a cost of £6,000 by Arthur Mitchell, whose son, Lt Col. Francis Mitchell, Commander of the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars, lived at nearby Doughton Manor. The Mitchells sold Highgrove after the Second World War to Lt Col. Gwyn Morgan.

The estate had been bought by the Macmillan family in 1956 for £89,000 and was put up for sale by the Conservative Party politician and businessman Maurice Macmillan, the son of former Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, for £730,000 in 1980. Macmillan sold Highgrove so he could spend more time at Birch Grove, his father&#x27;s West Sussex home. At the time of its sale Highgrove was described as a &quot;distinguished Georgian house standing in superb parkland in the Duke of Beaufort&#x27;s hunt&quot; and possessing , with nine bedrooms and six bathrooms.

In August 1980 the Highgrove estate was purchased by the Duchy of Cornwall for a figure believed to be between £800,000 and £1,000,000 with funds raised for its purchase by the sale of three properties from the duchy&#x27;s holdings, including part of the village of Daglingworth. The Duke of Cornwall, now Charles III, was subsequently appointed a tenant for life of Highgrove by the duchy. Upon its purchase, essential repairs were carried out, the interior was stripped out, and the rooms were painted white, in preparation for their redecoration. The swimming pool at Highgrove was given to the Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales, as a wedding present from the British Army.

From 1974, the previous residence of the Prince of Wales was due to be Chevening House in Kent, a house intended for use by a Cabinet member or descendant of King George VI who has been nominated by the Prime Minister. However, the Prince never occupied the house and renounced his interest in Chevening in 1980. The Prince of Wales found the journey from Chevening to Buckingham Palace inconvenient as a result of traffic congestion in South London, and it was also far away from Wales and the Duchy of Cornwall. The estate was also run by a board of trustees, appointed by the government which was seen as a disadvantage to any future changes the Prince of Wales wished to make. As £1 million of renovations had been made to Chevening before the Prince of Wales&#x27;s occupancy, the purchase of Highgrove was criticised by Labour MP Reg Race, who said that it was &quot;...bloody outrageous on a day that the Government are cutting social security benefits for millions of people&quot;. A spokesperson for the duchy said, &quot;It is coincidental that this estate has a house on it which is suitable for the Prince of Wales. The Royal Family are rather short of residences and the prince only has a set of rooms at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle that he can use...when you are 31 you want a place of your own&quot;.

The Prince of Wales had looked at a number of properties in different counties before the duchy purchased Highgrove. The Prince of Wales rejected houses at Stoke Climsland in Cornwall and Orchardleigh in Somerset. The Prince of Wales was attracted to Gloucestershire as it was equidistant between London and Cornwall, and he had known the locality around Badminton since his childhood, often hunting with the Duke of Beaufort&#x27;s Hunt.

The duchy&#x27;s local holdings were expanded after the purchase of Highgrove, with the addition of Broadfield Farm, a farm on the opposite side of Tetbury and other holdings to a total of by 1993.

In 1981 model maker Rosalind Hudson made a scale model of Highgrove as a wedding present for the Prince and Princess of Wales. Hudson later altered the model as Highgrove was altered.

Highgrove was initially occupied at weekends by the Prince and Princess of Wales, after their 1981 marriage, and their two children, Prince William and Prince Harry, spent much of their childhoods at the house.

Two former members of Highgrove&#x27;s staff, butler Paul Burrell and housekeeper Wendy Berry, have chronicled their time at the house. Burrell&#x27;s book &quot;A Royal Duty&quot; was published in 2003 and covers his time at Highgrove from the purchase of the house until Burrell&#x27;s departure with Diana in 1995. Berry&#x27;s 1995 book, &quot;The Housekeeper&#x27;s Diary&quot;, detailed her time at Highgrove from 1984 to 1993 and it was the subject of an injunction from the High Court. After publishing her book in the United States, Berry left the UK to avoid contempt-of-court charges.

In 2021, the then Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall spent the COVID-19 lockdown at Highgrove.

In January 2023, it was reported that the Orchard Tearooms at Highgrove House would be open to the public every Tuesday as a part of the Prince&#x27;s Foundation Gloucestershire Winter Warmers initiative, which was set up to tackle loneliness and isolation in cold weather by providing warm spaces. On 6 May 2023 the newly crowned King and Queen returned to Highgrove House after their coronation.

==Design==
Highgrove House was built between 1796 and 1798; it was believed to have been designed by architect Anthony Keck. The house is a rectangular detached three-storey building made from ashlar blocks with a stone and slate roof. The exterior of the house features neo-classical decorations. In its 1985 listing for the house, English Heritage described its design as &quot;Principal block, rectangular of five bays by three and of 3 storeys. Pilasters through the upper floors, cornice and parapet. The garden front (south-west) of 5 bays with a central canted bay of 2 storeys. Mid C19. 12-pane sashes. Sashes on south-east set in arched recesses.&quot; The house has four reception rooms, nine main bedrooms, with a nursery wing and staff quarters.

In 1893 a fire caused severe damage to the house, and it was rebuilt to its former appearance in 1894 by the Bristol architect John Hart. The fire gutted the interior and damaged the west façade, where a window collapsed onto the terrace, bringing down the wall above. A porch was added to the south-east front in 1894. An office wing to the north west of the house was demolished in 1966.

At the behest of the King, the artist Felix Kelly created an artist&#x27;s impression of a remodelled Highgrove with neo-classical additions. Kelly had previously painted a vision of Henbury Hall in Henbury, Cheshire based on Andrea Palladio&#x27;s Villa Rotonda. Kelly&#x27;s artwork had formed the basis for the construction of Henbury Hall, and a similar painting of Highgrove subsequently formed the basis for a remodelling of the house in December 1987, undertaken by architect Peter Falconer. The remodelling saw the exterior embellished with a new balustrade, pediment, and classical pilasters. A new single-storey staff annexe was also added. The additions were praised by the Georgian Group.

Other buildings built by The King at Highgrove include beehive pavilions and a beef-yard designed by Willie Bertram, built in traditional Cotswold stone. Four semi-detached cottages dubbed &#x27;the council houses&#x27; by The Prince of Wales were also renovated.

Highgrove House was given Grade II listed status in March 1985. In addition to the main house, the Coach House to the north west, and Lodge and Gate Piers to the east, were also given Grade II listed status.

After the marriage of The Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales in 1981 rooms at Highgrove were decorated by Dudley Poplak who regarded the commission as the &quot;most important assignment I have ever had.&quot; Poplak&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; later described his decorations for Highgrove as &quot;...a youthful variant of the chintzy country-house look that was seen everywhere that year...&quot; with a palette of clean fresh colours – plenty of lime green and aquamarine – he created a gentle relaxed mood with no flights of fancy other than the odd experiment with interesting textures&quot;. Following Diana&#x27;s departure from Highgrove, Poplak&#x27;s designs were replaced with those of Robert Kime at the behest of Camilla.

The King’s environmental beliefs have been reflected in changes to Highgrove. Solar panels have been installed on the farm and the house is heated by a wood chip boiler, in addition, waste from the house is filtered through a natural sewage system, and the use of aerosols was banned in the house in the 1980s. The lights at Highgrove were turned off for Earth Hour in 2008.

==Gardens==
The King has created a wild garden, a formal garden and a walled kitchen garden at Highgrove. He has also planted a large number of trees in the grounds, and holds the beech collection under the National Plant Collection scheme. Individual features in the gardens include the Carpet Garden, Southern Hemisphere Garden, Walled Garden, the Autumn Walk, Sundial Garden, and a Woodland Garden featuring two classical temples made from green oak and a stumpery created by Julian and Isabel Bannerman in 1996. The King has described his efforts as representing &quot;...one very small attempt to heal the appalling short-sighted damage done to the soil, the landscape and our own souls&quot; and has written that &quot;Some may not like it, others may scoff that it is not in the &#x27;real world&#x27; or it is merely an expensive indulgence. Whatever the case, my enduring hope is that those who visit the garden may find something to inspire, excite, fascinate or soothe them&quot;.

In 1980 The King was especially drawn to the 200-year-old Highgrove Cedar of Lebanon to the west of the house. After the diseased tree had to be felled in 2007 for safety reasons, a new oak pavilion with church-like spire was constructed over the base of the tree. The organic design by Mark Hoare has a rustic cruck frame on Cotswold staddle stones.

In 1981, the then Prince Charles hired American garden designer Lanning Roper, who was recommended by Camilla Parker Bowles, to design the gardens, but the project was terminated because Roper died of cancer in 1983.The Head Gardener is Debs Goodenough, who in July 2008 replaced David Howard. Charles was initially assisted in his creation of Highgrove&#x27;s gardens by Miriam Rothschild. He was further assisted by Lady Salisbury, who had restored the gardens of Hatfield House, and Rosemary Verey.

In 1985, organic farming was introduced on three blocks of land as part of a move to what has been called biologically sustainable farming linked to conservation. The step to full organic status on the whole estate was completed in 1994.

Pre-booked tours of the gardens are available to individuals and groups, between April and mid-October. Over 30,000 people visit the gardens annually.

The gardens were the source of inspiration for the British composer Patrick Hawes when he was asked to write a piece of music for The King&#x27;s 60th birthday in 2008. The resultant piece entitled &quot;Goddess of the Woods&quot; was first performed on the Prince&#x27;s birthday in the Floral Hall of the Royal Opera House. Three further movements ensued to create the &quot;Highgrove Suite&quot; each depicting different areas of the gardens at Highgrove. The suite was premiered at Highgrove on 8 June 2010 with the royal harpist Claire Jones and the Philharmonia orchestra.

The Highgrove Florilegium is a two-volume book series containing 124 watercolours of plants from the gardens.

The Sundial Garden was the first garden at Highgrove to be created by The King and had formerly been known as the South Garden. It is named for the stone sundial at its centre, sculpted by Walter Crang, a wedding present to The then Prince and Princess of Wales from the Duke of Beaufort and outside staff and gardeners. The garden faces south and its layout has remained largely unchanged since its creation. The Sundial Garden was originally planted with roses, and was briefly planted as a &#x27;black-and-white garden&#x27;. The garden is presently planted with herbaceous plants in pinks, blues, and purples, and surrounded by a large yew hedge planted in the winter of 1982.

A section of the garden contains busts of people admired by The King, including Debo Devonshire, composer John Tavener, naturalist Dame Miriam Rothschild, poet Kathleen Raine, activist Vandana Shiva, and the Bishop of London, Richard Chartres. Other people honoured by busts in the garden include the former museum director and art historian who helped design the Highgrove gardens Sir Roy Strong, and Léon Krier, who created Poundbury, a village built to The Prince of Wales&#x27;s architectural principles in Dorset. Busts of the former owner of Highgrove, Maurice Macmillan (sculpted by Angela Conner), the explorer and confidant of The Prince of Wales, Sir Laurens van der Post (sculptured by Frances Baruch), and pilot and psychiatrist Alan McGlashan are displayed in Highgrove&#x27;s Cottage Garden, in recesses in a yew hedge. A path of stone cobbles leaves the Cottage Garden, before surrounding a stone obelisk inscribed with &#x27;York, Weymouth and Bath&#x27;, given to The King for his 60th birthday by stone-masonry colleges.

==Highgrove House shops==
In 1992, the then Prince of Wales opened the Highgrove retail shops which sell products, including :Duchy Originals, for home and gardens.
The shops are located in Tetbury and in London, where the products are available at Fortnum &amp; Mason. A shop in Bath closed down in 2014. All profits from the sale of the products are paid to The Prince of Wales&#x27;s Charitable Foundation. In 2014, the shops began selling products online.

<doc id="364721" wikidata="Q197217" url="?curid=364721" title="Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)">
<text>The Parachute Regiment, known colloquially as the Paras, is the airborne and elite infantry regiment of the British Army. The first battalion is part of the Special Forces Support Group under the operational command of the Director Special Forces. The other battalions are the parachute infantry component of the British Army&#x27;s rapid response formation, 16 Air Assault Brigade. Alongside the five regiments of Foot Guards, the Parachute Regiment is the only infantry regiment of the British Army that has not been amalgamated with another unit since the end of the Second World War.

The Parachute Regiment was formed on 22 June 1940 during the Second World War and eventually raised 17 battalions. In Europe, these battalions formed part of the 1st Airborne Division, the 6th Airborne Division and the 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade Group. Another three battalions served with the British Indian Army in India and Burma. The regiment took part in six major parachute assault operations in North Africa, Italy, Greece, France, the Netherlands and Germany, often landing ahead of all other troops.

At the end of the Second World War, the regiment was reduced to three regular army battalions first assigned to the 16th Parachute Brigade and later the 5th Airborne Brigade. The reserve 16th Airborne Division was formed using the regiment reserve battalions in the Territorial Army. Defence cuts gradually reduced the TA formations to a parachute brigade and then a single reserve battalion. In the same time period, the regular army battalions have taken part in operations in Suez, Cyprus, Borneo, Aden, Northern Ireland, where they were involved in the Bloody Sunday massacre, the Falklands, the Kosovo War, the Balkans, Sierra Leone, Iraq and Afghanistan, at times being reinforced by men from the reserve battalion.

==Formation==

Impressed by the success of German airborne operations, during the Battle of France, the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, directed the War Office to investigate the possibility of creating a corps of 5,000 parachute troops. On 22 June 1940, No. 2 Commando was turned over to parachute duties and on 21 November, re-designated the 11th Special Air Service Battalion, with a parachute and glider wing. It was these men who took part in the first British airborne operation, Operation Colossus, on 10 February 1941. In September, the battalion was re-designated the 1st Parachute Battalion and assigned to the 1st Parachute Brigade. To fill out the brigade, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Parachute Battalions were raised by calling for volunteers from all units in the British Army.

The first operation by the Parachute Regiment was Operation Biting in February 1942. The objective was to capture a Würzburg radar on the coast of France. The raid was carried out by &#x27;C&#x27; Company, 2nd Parachute Battalion, under the command of Major John Frost.

The success of the raid prompted the War Office to expand the existing airborne force, setting up the Airborne Forces Depot and Battle School in Derbyshire in April 1942, and creating the Parachute Regiment as well as converting a number of infantry battalions into airborne battalions in August 1942. The 2nd Parachute Brigade was then formed from the 4th Battalion, transferred from the 1st Para Brigade, and two of the converted infantry battalions, the 5th Battalion from the 7th Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders and 6th Battalion from the 10th Royal Welch Fusiliers. The Army Air Corps was created as the command formation of the Parachute Regiment and the Glider Pilot Regiment. With two parachute brigades now in the order of battle, the 1st Airborne Division commanded by Major-General Frederick Arthur Montague Browning was formed. By the end of the war, the regiment had raised 17 battalions.

In India, the 50th Indian Parachute Brigade was raised on 27 October 1941, comprising 151 (British), 152 (Indian) and 153 (Gurkha) Parachute Battalions along with the brigade signals, sapper squadron and 80 Parachute Field Ambulance. 151 British Parachute Battalion moved to Egypt and then to England where it was redesignated 156 Parachute battalion and joined the 4th Parachute Brigade, 1st Airborne Division. The British battalion was composed of volunteers from the 27 infantry battalions of the British Army in India. The 2nd/7th Gurkha Battalion was converted en bloc to the airborne role and renamed 154th (Gurkha) Parachute Battalion. Later, when the formation was to expand, 14th and 77th Indian Parachute Brigades from the Chindit operations were converted and comprised one airborne battalion each of British, Indian and Gurkha troops. They were part of the 44th Indian Airborne Division.

===Training===

Parachute training was a 12-day course carried out at the No. 1 Parachute Training School, RAF Ringway. Recruits initially jumped from a converted barrage balloon and finished with five parachute jumps from an aircraft. Anyone failing to complete a parachute jump was returned to his old unit. At the end of the course, new Paras were presented with their maroon beret and parachute wings and posted to a parachute battalion. Parachute training was not without its dangers; three men were killed in the first 2,000 parachute jumps at Ringway.

Airborne soldiers were expected to fight against superior numbers of the enemy equipped with artillery and tanks. So training was designed to encourage a spirit of self-discipline, self-reliance and aggressiveness. Emphasis was given to physical fitness, marksmanship and fieldcraft. A large part of the training consisted of assault courses and route marching. Military exercises included capturing and holding airborne bridgeheads, road or rail bridges and coastal fortifications. At the end of most exercises, the battalion would march back to their barracks. An ability to cover long distances at speed was expected: airborne platoons were required to cover a distance of in 24 hours, and battalions .

===Equipment===
The Parachute Regiment had their own distinctive uniform: the maroon beret at first with the Army Air Corps cap badge and from May 1943 the Parachute Regiment cap badge which is still in use today. Parachute wings were worn on the right shoulder above the airborne forces patch of Bellerophon riding the flying horse Pegasus. On operations, Paras wore the airborne forces pattern steel helmet instead of the normal Brodie helmet. Initially they wore a &#x27;jump jacket&#x27; modelled on the German &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; jacket. After 1942, the Denison smock was issued as the first camouflaged uniform for the British Army. In 1943, a green sleeveless jacket was designed to wear over the Denison smock when parachuting. British Paras did not use a reserve parachute, as the War Office considered the £60 cost a waste of money.

The Parachute Regiment were not issued any special weapons. Their small arms were the same as the rest of the army&#x27;s: the bolt action Lee–Enfield rifle and the Enfield or Webley revolver or the M1911 pistol. For a submachine gun, they used the British Sten in Northwest Europe, which was issued in higher numbers than to a normal infantry battalion. Paratroopers attached to Eighth Army used the Thompson submachine gun in the North African and Mediterranean theatre and during Operation Dragoon. Each section had a Bren light machine gun and the platoon had a 2-inch mortar. The only battalion heavy weapons were eight 3-inch mortars, four Vickers machine guns and after 1943, ten PIAT anti tank weapons.

===Post war formations and reductions===

The airborne divisions were disbanded after the Second World War, with only the 2nd Parachute Brigade (1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions) remaining. In February 1948, it was renumbered the 16th Parachute Brigade and posted to the British Army on the Rhine. The brigade remained in Germany until October 1949, when it relocated to Aldershot, which became the home of the Parachute Regiment for the next 50 years. The Territorial Army (TA) reformed after the war and raised the 16th Airborne Division with nine parachute battalions (10th to 18th) in three parachute brigades. The division was disbanded in the 1956 defence cuts, leaving the 44th Independent Parachute Brigade as the only reserve parachute formation. The remaining reserve battalions were the 10th (City of London), 12th (Yorkshire), 13th (Lancashire), 15th (Scottish) and 17th (Durham Light Infantry). Further reductions resulted in the amalgamation of the 12th and 13th Battalions soon afterwards. In 1967, the TA battalions were reduced again, the 12th, 13th and 17th being amalgamated to reform the 4th Battalion. The 44th Independent Parachute Brigade was disbanded in 1977, leaving the reserve parachute battalions as independent units. Following the Falklands War, in November 1983 the 5th Airborne Brigade was formed for out-of-area operations. The brigade consisted of two of the parachute battalions and its own parachute trained artillery, engineers, medics, signals and logistics units. The Options for Change restructuring after the Cold War again reduced the number of TA battalions. The 4th and 15th Battalions were amalgamated in 1993 as the 4th Battalion, and the 10th Battalion was disbanded. The 5th Airborne Brigade lasted until the 1999 Strategic Defence Review, which recommended that the 5th Airborne and 24th Airmobile Brigade be amalgamated as the 16th Air Assault Brigade.

==Operational history==

===Second World War===
====North Africa====

In November 1942 the British First Army, with the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Parachute Battalions (1st Parachute Brigade) attached, invaded French Morocco and Algeria (Operation Torch). The British airborne operations in North Africa started on 12 November, when the 3rd Battalion carried out the first battalion sized parachute drop, on Bône airfield between Algiers and Tunis. The remainder of the brigade arrived by sea the next day. On 15 November, the 1st Battalion were ordered to parachute and capture a vital road junction at Béja west of Tunis. The battalion captured both Béja and Mateur after an attack on a German armoured column and an Italian tank position. The 2nd Battalion, now commanded by Lieutenant Colonel John Frost, carried out a parachute drop on Depienne Airfield south of Tunis. The airfield had been abandoned, so they marched to capture Oudna Airfield. There, they were supposed to have been relieved by advancing British forces, but they had been held up by unexpected German resistance. Frost contacted First Army, only to be informed that, as they were trapped behind the lines, they had been written off. The battalion headed for the British lines, but lost 266 men under constant German attack by the time they reached safety at Medjez el Bab.

In February 1943, the brigade deployed as normal infantry, serving in the front lines for the rest of the Tunisian Campaign. They fought notable actions at Bou Arada and Tamerza against their German counterparts, the Fallschirmjäger, where they earned the nickname &quot;Die Roten Teufel&quot; (the Red Devils).

====Sicily====
The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions (1st Parachute Brigade) next took part in Operation Fustian. This was an airborne assault to seize and hold the Primosole Bridge over the River Simeto, south of Mount Etna on the island of Sicily, and hold until relieved by ground forces. Those that survived the flight landed on the same drop zone (DZ) chosen by the 1st Fallschirmjäger Division, which had landed moments before the British aircraft appeared. The two forces engaged in a bitter fight, and the Paras failed to secure the landing ground for the following glider force of the 1st Airlanding Brigade carrying their artillery and heavy equipment. Those gliders that did land were not unloaded before the bridge was captured at 04:40. Later that day, the Germans counter-attacked with artillery support and, within hours, the Paras were driven off the bridge.

====Italy====
In September, the 4th, 5th and 6th Battalions (2nd Parachute Brigade) and the 10th, 11th and 156th Battalions (4th Parachute Brigade) took part in Operation Slapstick, a landing from the sea near the port of Taranto in Italy. Their objective was to capture the port and several nearby airfields, and link up with the British Eighth Army, before pressing north to join the U.S. Fifth Army near Foggia. They landed unopposed on 9 September 1943, the only losses being 58 men of the 6th Battalion, lost at sea when their ship struck a mine. Pushing inland, the Paras captured the town of Castellaneta and the town and airfield of Gioia del Colle before the 4th Parachute Brigade was withdrawn from the theatre.

On 14 September 1943, a company of the 11th Battalion carried out a parachute drop on the island of Kos. The Italian garrison surrendered, and the company was quickly reinforced by men from the 1st Battalion, Durham Light Infantry and Royal Air Force Regiment, before being withdrawn on 25 September and in December 1943, the 11th Battalion rejoined the division in England.

The 2nd Parachute Brigade fought on in Italy under command of several infantry divisions, including the 2nd New Zealand Division and 8th Indian Infantry Division. In June 1944 they carried out Operation Hasty, the only parachute drop on the Italian mainland. This was a 60-man raid ahead of 2nd NZ Division&#x27;s area intended to disrupt the German demolition plan during the withdrawal from the Gothic Line. 2nd Parachute Brigade took part in Operation Dragoon in southern France, then returned to Italy briefly before being sent to Greece.

====Normandy====
The next operation for the regiment was in Normandy, France with the 6th Airborne Division. The 8th and 9th Battalions, along with the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion, from the (3rd Parachute Brigade) and the 7th, 12th and 13th Battalions of the (5th Parachute Brigade) were involved. The mission was Operation Tonga, capturing bridges over the River Orne and Caen Canal, and destroying the Merville Gun Battery and several other bridges to prevent the Germans reaching the landing beaches. The 7th Battalion had so many missing that, by 03:00, only around 40 per cent of the battalion had been accounted for. They did, however, manage to reinforce the glider troops of 2nd Battalion, Oxford and Bucks Light Infantry, from the 6th Airlanding Brigade, that had captured the Caen canal and Orne river bridges and held them until relieved by the 3rd Infantry Division. The 12th and 13th Battalions also had about 40 per cent of their men go missing. The 12th had to capture the village of Le Bas de Ranville, whilst the 13th was to take the town of Ranville. Both battalions then helped secure the area around the captured bridges until relieved. Only about 150 men of the 9th Battalion had assembled when they launched their assault on the Merville Gun Battery. Their attack on the battery was successful, but with heavy casualties: 50 dead and 25 wounded. The 8th Battalion had to destroy two bridges near Bures and a third by Troarn. All bridges were destroyed and the battalion numbering around 190 men dug in around Troarn. The paras held the left flank of the invasion area until going onto the offensive on the night of 16/17 August. In nine days, they advanced to the mouth of the River Seine, capturing over 1,000 German prisoners. On 27 August, the division was withdrawn from the front line and embarked for England in September. The division&#x27;s casualties were 821 killed, 2,709 wounded and 927 missing.

====South of France====

The 4th, 5th and 6th Parachute Battalions (2nd Independent Parachute Brigade) had been left in Italy when the 1st Airborne Division returned to England. On 15 August 1944, the 1st Airborne Task Force (ATF), including the 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade, parachuted into the region between Fréjus and Cannes in the south of France. Their objective was to destroy all enemy positions in the area and hold until the U.S. Seventh Army came ashore. The ATF was preceded at 03:30 by nine pathfinder teams; only three teams, all from the 2nd Independent Parachute Brigade, landed on the correct DZs. When the brigade starting landing on 04:50, the drop was dispersed. Most of the 6th Battalion, half of the 4th, and one company of the 5th landed on their DZs. Most of the rest of the Paras were scattered over a 9-mile (14 km) area, but some landed away at Cannes. The battalions achieved all their objectives apart from the town of Le Muy on the first day. The brigade remained in France until 26 August and then returned to Italy.

====Arnhem====
The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Battalions (1st Parachute Brigade) and the 10th, 11th and 156th Battalions (4th Parachute Brigade) were next in action in Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands with the 1st Airborne Division. The resulting Battle of Arnhem has since become a byword for the fighting spirit of British paratroops and set a standard for the Parachute Regiment. The division&#x27;s mission was to capture intact the road, rail and pontoon bridges over the Lower Rhine at Arnhem and hold them until relieved, which was expected to occur two or three days later. A shortage of transport aircraft hindered operations, and it would take two days for all three of the division&#x27;s brigades to arrive. It was decided that the 1st Parachute and the airlanding brigade would land on the first day. The DZs and LZs would be secured by the airlanding brigade, whilst the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Parachute battalions would head into Arnhem and capture the bridges. On the second day, the 4th Parachute Brigade would arrive. These battalions would dig in north and north-west of Arnhem.
On day one 17 September 1944, the 1st Parachute Brigade landed and headed towards Arnhem, but only the 2nd Battalion, largely unopposed, made it to the bridges. The railway bridge was blown up as they approached and the pontoon bridge was missing a section. By dusk, most of the 2nd Battalion and some supporting units, including the Brigade Headquarters, numbering about 740 men, had taken the northern end of the Arnhem road bridge.
By the second day, the 9th SS Panzer Division arrived in Arnhem, deploying to the west of the city and cutting off access to the bridge.

On day two attempts by the 1st and 3rd Battalions to fight through to the bridge were unsuccessful and, by 10:00, they had been halted. At the bridge, the 2nd Battalion continued to hold out against German armoured and infantry attacks. Several hours later than expected, at 15:00, the 4th Parachute Brigade landed under fire from the Germans. The 11th Battalion was sent towards Arnhem to assist in the attempt to break through to the bridge, linking up with the 1st and 3rd Battalions after dark. The 10th and 156th Battalions moved to take up their planned positions north-west of Arnhem. En route, in the dark, the 156th Battalion came under fire and halted for the night.

In the morning of the third day, the 1st, 3rd, and 11th Battalions and the 2nd Battalion, South Staffords (1st Airlanding Brigade) tried to fight through to the bridge. Crossing open ground, the 1st Battalion was engaged by heavy fire from three sides. Trapped in the open, the 1st Battalion was decimated, and the 3rd had to withdraw. The 11th, which until then had not been heavily involved, were now exposed by the withdrawal and overwhelmed. Unable to break through the German line, the remaining men retreated towards the main force, now at Oosterbeek. In the north, the 10th and 156th Battalions were spotted as they attempted to seize the high ground in the woods north of Oosterbeek. Both battalions came under German fire and were unable to advance any further. Ordered to fall back on Wolfheze and Oosterbeek, they had to fight all the way, with the Germans in close pursuit. At the bridge, the 2nd Battalion still held out, but short of supplies, their position was becoming untenable. The Germans, had started destroying the buildings the battalion occupied with tank, artillery and mortar fire.

By day four, the battered division was too weak to make any attempt to reach the bridge. Of the nine infantry battalions, only the 1st Battalion, Border Regiment, still existed as a unit; the others were just remnants and battalions in name only. The division, unable to do anything for the 2nd Battalion at the bridge, dug in, forming a defensive perimeter around Oosterbeek with its base on the river. The remnants of the 10th and 156th battalions at Wolfheze began to fall back, but several elements were surrounded and captured. Some 150 men of 156th Battalion were pinned down just west of the Oosterbeek. These men broke out in the late afternoon, with 90 of them making it into the perimeter. At the bridge, Lieutenant Colonel Frost finally made radio contact with the division and was told that reinforcement was doubtful. Shortly afterwards, Frost was injured by a mortar bomb, and command passed to Major Frederick Gough. Gough arranged a two-hour truce to evacuate his wounded (including Frost), who were taken into captivity. That night, some units managed to hold out for a while and several tried to break out towards Oosterbeek, but by 05:00 on day five, all resistance at the bridge had ceased.

The division managed to hold on for nine days, until it was decided to withdraw back across the Rhine by rafts and boats. At 10:00 on the last day, the Germans launched an assault with infantry and tanks on the south-east portion of the perimeter. The assault penetrated the perimeter and threatened to cut off the division from the river. British counter-attacks, supported by artillery fire from south of the river, stopped the German assault. To prevent the Germans learning about the evacuation, the plan was kept secret until the afternoon, and some men (mainly wounded) remained behind to give covering fire through the night. By 05:00, 2,163 men had been rescued and the evacuation was ended.

The two parachute brigades had contained 3,082 men of the Parachute Regiment. Of these, 2,656 were killed or reported missing and only 426 made it to safety. The only awards of the Victoria Cross to the Parachute Regiment in the war were for the Battle of Arnhem. The two recipients were Captain John Hollington Grayburn of the 2nd Battalion, and Captain Lionel Ernest Queripel of the 10th Battalion; both awards were posthumous.
====Ardennes====
On 16 December 1944, the German Army launched a surprise offensive against the U.S. First Army through the Ardennes the Battle of the Bulge. The 6th Airborne Division, refitting in England, was flown to Belgium on 22 December to help stop the German attack. By 26 December, the division was in the Dinant and Namur area. On 29 December, they received orders to launch a counter-attack on the leading German units. The 13th Battalion, part of the 5th Parachute Brigade, suffered the heaviest losses. Between 3–5 January, the battalion fought to capture the village of Bure. After they had taken the village, the battalion had to fight off a number of counter-attacks. By the end of the battle, their casualties were 68 dead and 121 wounded or missing.

====Rhine crossing====
The airborne assault over the Rhine (Operation Varsity), was the largest single airborne operation in the history of airborne warfare and also involved the U.S. 17th Airborne Division. Five battalions of the Parachute Regiment in the 6th Airborne Division took part. The first unit to land was the 3rd Parachute Brigade (8th, 9th and 1st Canadian Battalions). The brigade suffered a number of casualties as it engaged the German forces in the Diersfordter Wald, but by 11:00, the DZ was almost cleared of German forces. The key town of Schnappenberg was captured by the 9th Battalion in conjunction with the 1st Canadian Battalion. Despite taking casualties, the brigade cleared the area of German forces, and by 13:45, the brigade reported it had secured all of its objectives.

The next unit to land was the 5th Parachute Brigade (7th, 12th and 13th Battalions). The poor visibility around the DZ made it difficult for the Paras to rally. The DZ came under heavy fire from German troops stationed nearby and was subjected to shellfire and mortaring which inflicted casualties in the battalion rendezvous areas. However, the 7th Battalion soon cleared the DZ of German troops, many of whom were situated in farms and houses, and the 12th and 13th secured the rest of the brigade&#x27;s objectives. The brigade was then ordered to move due east and clear an area near Schnappenberg, as well as to engage German forces gathered to the west of the farmhouse where the 6th Airborne Division Headquarters was established. By 15:30, the brigade had secured all of its objectives and linked up with other British airborne units.

By nightfall of 24 March, out of the 7,220 men of the 6th Airborne Division who had taken part in the operation, 1,400 men had been reported killed, wounded or missing.

===Post war operations===

====Far East====
In May 1945, it was intended that the 6th Airborne Division should be deployed to the Far East. It was intended they would form an Airborne Corps with the 44th Indian Airborne Division. The first unit to leave was the 5th Parachute Brigade, under the command of Kenneth Darling. The brigade consisted of the 7th, 12th and 13th Battalions, 22nd Independent Parachute Company, and support units. The brigade arrived in India in June 1945 and started jungle training, but Japan surrendered before it was completed. The Japanese surrender changed British plans and it was decided the 6th Airborne Division would become the Imperial Strategic Reserve and stay in Europe. The brigade was used on operations in Malaya, and Singapore restoring order after the Japanese occupation.

In December, the brigade was part of Operation Pounce, a mission to disarm the remaining Japanese forces in Java until they could be relieved by Dutch forces in April 1946. On their arrival in Batavia (Jakarta) they discovered that the Japanese had handed over their weapons to Indonesian nationalists who attacked the British force when they tried to wrest control, knowing that the British intended to return Batavia to the Dutch. The brigade dispersed rioters and patrolled the city until they were moved to Semarang on the coast between Batavia and Surabaya in January 1946. To prevent nationalists entering the town, the three battalions established patrols on the outskirts of the town and seized the docks and the airport. Despite a number of guerrilla attacks, the Indonesians were defeated. In April 1946, the British handed over control to the Dutch and returned to Singapore.

====Palestine====

As the Imperial reserve, the 6th Airborne Division was sent to Palestine in September 1945 as the Jewish insurgency in Mandatory Palestine intensified. The division now consisted of the 2nd Parachute Brigade (4th, 5th and 6th Battalions), 3rd Parachute Brigade (3rd, 8th and 9th Battalions) and 6th Airlanding Brigade. Their mission was to support the police in keeping the peace between the Arab and Jewish populations. In November, the 3rd Parachute Brigade had to intervene during Arab-Jewish riots in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv that had persisted for a number of days. The division also conducted a 48-hour search of Tel Aviv called Operation Shark in response to the King David Hotel bombing. While in Palestine, the division was subjected to numerous attacks by Jewish fighters; in one such on 25 April 1947, Lehi killed seven men of the 5th Battalion.

Palestine was a time of change for the Paras. With the reduction in the army after the war, the 1st Airborne Division had been disbanded and the 1st Parachute Brigade (1st, 2nd and 17th Battalions) joined the 6th Division on 1 April 1946 to replace the 6th Airlanding Brigade. In August, the 5th Parachute Brigade (7th, 12th and 13th Battalions) rejoined the division from the Far East, but was soon disbanded and its men reassigned to the other battalions in the division. Further reductions saw the disbandment of the 3rd Parachute Brigade in October 1947, leaving just the 1st and 2nd Brigades in the division. On 18 February 1948, news that the division was to be disbanded was received, leaving only one regular army parachute brigade, the 2nd, soon renumbered the 16th Parachute Brigade.

====1950s Cyprus and Suez====
For most of the next 20 years, the Parachute Regiment was involved in numerous peacekeeping and small scale operations associated with the withdrawal from empire. In 1951, the Prime Minister of Iran, Mohammad Mosaddegh, seized the oilfields in Abadan. The 16th Parachute Brigade was sent out to Cyprus in June to be ready to intervene should it be required. They were soon sent to reinforce the British troops in the Suez Canal Zone in response to Egyptian nationalists threatening the bases there. The brigade returned to Cyprus between January and July 1956 because of attacks on British forces by EOKA insurgents.

On 5 November 1956, the 3rd Battalion conducted what would become the last British battalion-sized parachute assault. The objective was the El Gamil airfield in Port Said during the Suez Crisis. The battalion secured the airfield and dug in to wait the arrival of the rest of the assault forces by sea. The 1st and 2nd Battalions arrived at Port Said by Landing Ship Tank, the 2nd Battalion were delayed in starting to advance towards Ismailia. The battalion was supported by the tanks of the 6th Royal Tank Regiment, but due to the delay, they were still short of their objective when a ceasefire was announced. On 14 November, the brigade returned to Cyprus.

====1960s Kuwait, Aden and Malaysia====

In a statement on 25 June 1961, President Abd al-Karim Qasim of Iraq claimed that Kuwait was part of his country and announced his intention to annexe it. On the strength of a formal defence commitment between the two countries, Kuwait appealed for help from Britain. A force was assembled (Operation Vantage) which included armour, artillery, commando, and infantry battalions, one being the 2nd Battalion, based in Cyprus. The battalion was not involved in any combat and remained just long enough for the Arab League to take over from them. All British forces had withdrawn by 19 October.
In 1960, Britain decided to withdraw from Aden, which was then part of the Federation of South Arabia, with independence scheduled for 1968. This decision started a campaign by the local tribes against the regular army. Supported by Egypt, communist infiltration reached a head in 1963 when Britain was forced to take action in support of the local government in what was called the Aden Emergency. The British force, known as Radforce, comprised a mixture of troops including a company from the 3rd Battalion. The rest of the 3rd Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Anthony Farrar-Hockley, was also sent to Aden to conduct operations in the Radfan mountains, capturing the Bkri ridge in May 1964. Farrar-Hockley was awarded the bar for his Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for this operation. The rest of the battalion were awarded two Military Crosses (MC) and one Military Medal (MM), and a number were mentioned in dispatches. By 1964, the terrorist attacks had spread to Aden, south of Radfan; to protect British servicemen and their dependents, the 1st Battalion was deployed on security duties throughout the areas of Crater and Khormasker. In January 1967, the 1st Battalion returned to Aden on an emergency tour to cover the final withdrawal of British troops from the region. For a series of actions in June in the Sheik Othman and Al Mansura districts of Aden, the battalion&#x27;s commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Michael J. H. Walsh, was awarded the DSO. The rest of the battalion were awarded three MCs and one MM, and a number were mentioned in dispatches.

In 1965, the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment, was sent to Singapore for jungle training in response to the threat of invasion from Indonesian President Sukarno. By March, the battalion was established along the Malaysia–Indonesia border in Borneo and conducting 10-day patrols in the jungle. On 27 April, &#x27;B&#x27; Company&#x27;s base on the hilltop village of Plaman Mapu, consisting of company headquarters, a mortar section, and one weak platoon of young soldiers, was attacked by 150 Indonesians supported by rocket launchers, mortars, rifle grenades, and machine guns from the surrounding hills. The accurate fire caused several casualties amongst the defenders. The Company Sergeant Major (CSM), John Williams, was in command of the defence. He kept moving around the base, attending to the wounded, reorganising the defenders to counter each attack, and firing illumination rounds from a 2-inch mortar. The Indonesians penetrated the wire, taking out a mortar position. CSM Williams crossed the open ground under fire to man a machine gun, which he used to engage the Indonesians inside the perimeter. Covered by the machine gun, the Paras counter-attacked and forced the Indonesians back. The Indonesians had located CSM Williams&#x27;s machine gun, and in a second attack, it was subjected to heavy fire at point-blank range. Wounded and blinded in one eye, CSM Williams returned fire, defeating the second attack. He then led a fighting patrol to attack two groups of Indonesians seen approaching the base.

For the successful defence of the base, CSM Williams was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal (DCM); in the same action, Corporal Malcolm Baughan was awarded an MM.

====1970s Northern Ireland====
The British Army during Operation Banner spent 38 years in Northern Ireland, during which the 2nd Battalion spent more time there than any other infantry battalion. Between 1971 and 1996, 51 men of the Parachute Regiment were killed while serving in Northern Ireland.

The first was Sergeant Michael Willetts, 3rd Battalion. On 24 May 1971, he was killed during a bombing incident at the Springfield Road Police Station in Belfast. A hand-carried bomb in a suitcase was left at the front of the station. Sergeant Willetts held open a door allowing members of the public and police officers to escape and then stood in the doorway, shielding those taking cover. For his actions, he was awarded the George Cross.

=====Ballymurphy massacre=====
Following Operation Demetrius (the mass arrest and internment of Irish nationalists), soldiers of the Parachute Regiment were involved in an action which came to be called the Ballymurphy massacre, in which 11 innocent civilians were shot dead and dozens wounded between 9 and 11 August 1971. At the Ballymurphy inquest in 2019, Sir Geoffrey Howlett, who in 1971 was a lieutenant colonel and commander of the Parachute Regiment&#x27;s Second Battalion, gave evidence in which he acknowledged that &quot;most, if not all&quot; of those killed were not members of the IRA, and that a regimental note from 1971 indicating that the incident inflicted &quot;severe casualties&quot; on the IRA may have been a mistake. Howlett added that he had &quot;enormous sympathy&quot; toward the families of those killed.

=====Bloody Sunday=====

In what has become known as &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;, the 1st Battalion were sent to Derry on 30 January 1972 to help to police a civil rights march demanding an end to internment. The Paras shot dead 13 unarmed civilians and wounded another 17 (one of whom later died of his wounds).

The first inquiry into the Bloody Sunday events, produced by Baron Widgery in April 1972, largely cleared the Paras of blame. It denoted some of their shooting as &quot;bordering on the reckless&quot; but mostly accepted their claims that they shot at gunmen and bomb-throwers. As a result of the subsequent and more detailed Saville report, even observers who are natural supporters of the British Army are assessed as regarding the Widgery findings as &quot;discredited.&quot;

A more detailed inquiry—chaired by Lord Saville (Bloody Sunday Inquiry) and lasting over a decade—concluded that the Paras had fired on unarmed civilians, most of whom were shot while fleeing or trying to help the wounded. It found that none of the march participants were posing a serious threat, that no bombs were thrown, and that soldiers &quot;knowingly put forward false accounts&quot; to justify their firing. 

The soldiers denied shooting the victims named or anyone else by mistake. The inquiry found that soldiers had been fired at by members of the &#x27;Official IRA&#x27; but concluded that the Paras had fired the first shots and that none of the soldiers had fired in response to attacks or to threatened attacks by gunmen or bomb-throwers, although two soldiers suffered slight injuries from acid or a similar, corrosive substance. This inquiry identified failures of leadership and command by the commanding officer, and failures by individual soldiers involved. 

Representatives of the soldiers involved criticised the report as &quot;one-sided&quot;. Prime Minister David Cameron, addressing the House of Commons in 2010 after the publication of the report, stated that the Paras&#x27; action overall was &quot;both unjustified and unjustifiable, it was wrong&quot;.

The 1972 Aldershot bombing was carried out by the &#x27;Official IRA&#x27; as a revenge attack for Bloody Sunday. On 22 February 1972, a car bomb was left outside the officers&#x27; mess of the 16th Parachute Brigade in Aldershot. When the bomb exploded, a Roman Catholic priest serving in the army and five female kitchen staff were killed while 19 others were injured.

=====Shankill Road shootings=====
The 1st Battalion was involved in another controversial shooting incident on 7 September 1972. The Paras raided houses and the headquarters of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) in the Protestant Shankill area of Belfast. Two Protestant civilians were shot dead and others wounded by the Paras, who claimed they were returning fire at loyalist gunmen. This sparked angry demonstrations by local Protestants, and a unit of the Army&#x27;s Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) refused to carry out duties until 1 Para was withdrawn from the Shankill.

=====Warrenpoint ambush=====
On 27 August 1979, 16 men of the 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment, and two from the Queen&#x27;s Own Highlanders (QOH) were killed in the Warrenpoint ambush. The first six Paras were killed while travelling in a small convoy of three vehicles. As it passed a roadside bomb hidden in a lorry by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA), the bomb exploded. The PIRA had studied how the Army reacted after a bombing and correctly guessed that they would set up an incident command point in the nearby gatehouse. A second bomb detonated 32 minutes later, killing 10 Paras and two men from the QOH, one being Lieutenant-Colonel David Blair, their commanding officer. After the first explosion, the soldiers, believing that they had come under attack from the IRA, began firing across the narrow maritime border with the Republic of Ireland, a distance of only 57 m (187 feet). An uninvolved civilian, Michael Hudson (an Englishman whose father was a coachman at Buckingham Palace) was killed as a result, and his cousin Barry Hudson wounded. According to RUC researchers, the soldiers may have mistaken the sound of ammunition cooking off from the destroyed Land Rover for enemy gunfire from across the border. The Paras were under orders not to pursue their attackers into the Republic to avoid causing any diplomatic incidents. The death toll in the Warrenpoint ambush is the highest suffered by the British Army in a single incident in Northern Ireland.

====Falklands War====

On 2 April 1982, the Falklands War began when Argentine forces began the invasion of the British Overseas Territories of the Falkland Islands and South Georgia. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher announced on 3 April that a naval task force was being sent to the South Atlantic to &quot;restore British administration to the Falkland Islands&quot;. On 20 April, the British war cabinet ordered the repossession of the Falkland Islands and South Georgia. The force dispatched to carry this out was based on the 3 Commando Brigade, reinforced by the 2nd and 3rd Battalions, Parachute Regiment. At 04:40 21 May, the 2nd Battalion was the first major unit to land in the Falklands, just south of San Carlos on the eastern side of San Carlos Water. They immediately moved south to the Sussex Mountains to cover the landings. By daylight, all troops had landed with little opposition.

The first battle in the campaign was the Battle of Goose Green, undertaken by the 2nd Battalion on 28 May. After a day long battle the Argentine commanders, agreed to surrender at 09:30 29 May. The battle had cost the battalion 15 dead and 37 wounded. The Argentines had lost 55 dead, about 100 wounded and 1,500 were taken prisoner. Lieutenant-Colonel H. Jones was later awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross; amongst other awards were one DSO, and two DCMs.

Over the night 11/12 June, the 3rd Battalion fought the Battle of Mount Longdon. Longdon is a prominent feature to the north-west of the island&#x27;s capital, Port Stanley, which dominates the surrounding area. During the battle Sergeant Ian McKay, was killed in a single handed attack on a machine gun position. For his actions, he was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross, the second of only two such awards during the war. Other members of the battalion received a DSO, two DCMs.

The last battle of the war was the Battle of Wireless Ridge by the 2nd Battalion. The ridge was taken with minimal casualties and an Argentine counter-attack defeated. The Argentines now had their backs to the sea, and only the capital, Stanley, remained to be liberated. Later that day, 14 June 1982, General Menéndez surrendered all Argentine forces. The cost to the two battalions was 40 dead and 93 wounded, the highest death toll of any British regiment on land in that conflict.

====Balkans====
In May 1999, the British government decided to send a force of 17,400 troops to take part in operations in Kosovo, saying that the troops would be needed to rebuild the infrastructure after the Kosovo War. An additional 12,000 troops joined the force of 5,400 already stationed in the Republic of Macedonia. On 6 June, the 5th Airborne Brigade, including the 1st Battalion and other units, were flown to Macedonia. On 12 June, the brigade spearheaded Operation Joint Guardian the advance into Kosovo by KFOR. The 1st Battalion and other brigade units secured the high ground above the road from Bace to Pristina. With the road covered, NATO forces could start their advance into the country.

On 12 June, British paratroopers and other NATO forces had a tense standoff against Russian paratroopers over the Russian occupation of the Pristina Airport. The incident was peacefully resolved.

On 24 June, the 1st Battalion Battle Group assumed control of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo. On that first day, they had to deal with murder, kidnapping, torture, inter-communal gun-battles, house burnings, beatings, weapon finds and looting. The number of incidents reported required all the battalion&#x27;s subunits. By the afternoon, there were no reserves left. To relieve the problem, an ad hoc patrol of headquarters staff, including the padre, was formed to assist.

In August 2001, the 2nd Battalion took part in NATO&#x27;s intervention in the Republic of Macedonia (Operation Essential Harvest) to disarm the rebel National Liberation Army, with the mission planned to last 30 days.

====Sierra Leone====

In May 2000, Operation Palliser was the name given to the evacuation of British, Commonwealth and European Union citizens from Sierra Leone. At the time, rebel activity was increasing and the capital city Freetown was in danger. A task force including the 1st Battalion, less &#x27;A&#x27; Company but reinforced by &#x27;D&#x27; Company, 2nd Battalion, and the Pathfinder Platoon, elements of the Special Air Service (SAS), the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force were dispatched to the country.

A forward operating base at Lungi Airport, to be used in the evacuation, was seized by &#x27;C&#x27; Company, 1st Battalion, arriving by C-130 Hercules.

On 17 May, the Pathfinder Platoon in the village of Lungi Lol, from the airport, were attacked by the rebels. The fight lasted several hours, killing over 30 rebels without loss to the Pathfinders.
At the end of May, the Parachute Regiment was relieved by 42 Commando and returned to the United Kingdom.

The British Army agreed to provide a unit to train government forces and carry out foot and vehicle mounted patrols designed to ensure the security of areas where training bases were located. In August, this unit was based on the Royal Irish Regiment. On 25 August, a 12-man vehicle patrol in the Occra Hills was ambushed and forced to surrender by an armed rebel group known as the West Side Boys. Negotiations led to the release of six of the men. The remainder were rescued during Operation Barras by a combined team from A Company of the 1st Battalion and the SAS.

====Iraq====
In January 2003, the British government announced that the 1st Armoured Division would be sent to the Persian Gulf for potential operations in Iraq. The division units would be the 7th Armoured Brigade, 3 Commando Brigade, and the 16 Air Assault Brigade with the 1st and 3rd Battalions, Parachute Regiment and the 1st Battalion, Royal Irish Regiment. The invasion began on 19 March. The battalions&#x27; first objective was to secure the Rumaylah oilfields before heading north to secure the main supply route north of Basra. By the end of the month, the 3rd Battalion had entered Basra unopposed. The other two battalions crossed the Euphrates River and occupied El Qurna. As the fighting ended, the 1st Battalion occupied Maysan province and Al Amarah, less one company sent to Baghdad to secure the British Embassy. By July, the 16 Air Assault Brigade had returned to Britain.
During the war, Sergeant Gordon Robertson became the first Para to be awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Cross for service in Al-Majar on 24 June 2003.

====Afghanistan====
In May 2006, as part of the 16 Air Assault Brigade, the 3rd Battalion were sent to Afghanistan for Operation Herrick. They were part of 3,300 British troops that would be deploying to Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan as a component of the NATO International Security Assistance Force. Not expecting to be involved in any fighting, they were the only infantry unit in the brigade involved.

In December 2006, it was announced that Corporal Bryan Budd 3rd Battalion had been awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for two separate acts of &quot;inspirational leadership and the greatest valour&quot; which led to his death during actions against the Taliban in Afghanistan in July and August 2006. In the same deployment, Corporal Mark Wright 3rd Battalion was awarded a posthumous George Cross. Wright was killed after entering a minefield near Kajaki Dam to save a wounded colleague that had stepped on an old Russian mine.

The brigade returned to Afghanistan from April to October 2008. This time, the three parachute battalions were reinforced by reservists from the 4th Battalion.
In October 2010, the 2nd and 3rd Battalions, reinforced by the 4th Battalion, 16 Air Assault Brigade, returned to Afghanistan for their third tour.

In 2015, Lance Corporal Joshua Leakey became the third serviceman during the War in Afghanistan to receive the Victoria Cross for showing &quot;complete disregard&quot; for his own safety during a 2013 Taliban attack.

==Structure==
The Parachute Regiment consists of three regular army battalions, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, and an Army Reserve battalion, the 4th. The 1st is based at St Athan, Wales, and is permanently attached to the Special Forces Support Group (SFSG). They receive further training on additional weapons, communications equipment and specialist assault skills. All soldiers within the Parachute Regiment can expect to serve with the SFSG on rotation. This ensures that the advanced military skills taught to the SFSG are maintained in the other two regular battalions. The 2nd and 3rd battalions are the parachute infantry component of the 16 Air Assault Brigade, the army&#x27;s rapid response brigade, and are based at Colchester Garrison. The reserve 4th Battalion has its headquarters at Thornbury Barracks, near Pudsey in Leeds, and companies in Glasgow, Liverpool and London.

===Selection===
Volunteers for the Parachute Regiment are invited to a 3-day insight course at the Parachute Regiment Assessment Course (PRAC) at Catterick Garrison. Over the three days, they have to pass a series of physical fitness assessments. Adult entry recruit training is then undertaken over a 30-week course with 2nd Infantry Training Battalion at the Infantry Training Centre at Catterick. Junior soldiers enlisted for roles in the Parachute Regiment receive initial training which is held at the Army Foundation College. Junior soldiers are also enrolled on the Operation Achilles pathway during their last 12 weeks of phase 1 training, before they transfer to phase 2 training at the Infantry Training Centre. P company puts recruits through a number of physical assessments designed to test fitness, stamina and teamwork skills. At the end of P Company, recruits take part in eight pre-parachute selection tests. Those who are successful are awarded their maroon beret.

Currently, recruits for the Parachute Regiment must be aged 16 to 35 years and 6 months for the regular Army, or 18 to 40 for the Army Reserve (4 PARA).
Potential Officers must be aged 18 to 29. After the British government removed the ban on women serving in Ground Close Combat (GCC) roles, women are permitted to join all infantry units, including the Parachute Regiment.

Hannah Knapton became the first female officer in the Parachute Regiment in March 2023.

===Parachute training===
On completion of basic training and entry into a battalion, recruits are posted to RAF Brize Norton for a Basic Parachute Course. Since 1995, all parachute jumps are carried out from powered aircraft. Prior to 1995, the first jump in the Basic Parachute Course was undertaken from a modified Barrage balloon, but this has since been replaced with the Skyvan. Recruits must complete a minimum of five jumps in order to qualify as a military parachutist.

The last time a British battalion-sized unit parachuted into combat was in 1956 during the Suez Crisis, but it is still considered a valid method of deployment.

Details of operations for the 1st Battalion are not known, as the British government does not comment on special forces but it is believed that in 2010 a company group from the Special Forces Support Group (SFSG) parachuted operationally into Afghanistan.

== Regimental charter ==
The regimental charter is as follows:
==Regimental museum==
The Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces Museum is based at Duxford, Cambridgeshire.

==Regimental band==
The Band of the Parachute Regiment is one of many British Army bands in the United Kingdom, representing the Parachute Regiment, as a component of British Army Bands Colchester, it is administratively under the Royal Corps of Army Music. Over the years, the band has visited nations like the United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Qatar, Cyprus, the Falkland Islands and Norway. It has a variety of smaller ensembles that include the brass quintet and the fanfare team. On certain occasions, the regimental mascot leads the marching band on parade.

The regiment did not have any formal musical activity until 1947, when 1st and 2nd Battalion Bands were formed in Aldershot, with a 3rd Battalion band being formed a year later. As a result of a Defence Review in 1985, the battalion Bands were disbanded and reformed to produce two larger regimental bands, the Falklands and Pegasus Bands.

He was a founder of geographical botany and Charles Darwin&#x27;s closest friend. For 20 years he served as director of the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, succeeding his father, William Jackson Hooker, and was awarded the highest honours of British science.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Hooker was born in Halesworth, Suffolk, England. He was the second son of Maria Sarah Turner, eldest daughter of the banker Dawson Turner and sister-in-law of Francis Palgrave, and the famous botanist Sir William Jackson Hooker, Regius Professor of Botany. From the age of seven, Hooker attended his father&#x27;s lectures at the University of Glasgow, taking an early interest in plant distribution and the voyages of explorers like Captain James Cook. He was educated at the Glasgow High School and went on to study medicine at the University of Glasgow graduating with an MD in 1839.

His degree qualified him for employment in the Naval Medical Service. He joined the polar explorer Captain James Clark Ross&#x27;s Antarctic expedition to the South Magnetic Pole after receiving a commission as Assistant-Surgeon on . On this expedition, Hooker was granted full access to the private library of Richard Clement Moody, then Governor of the Falkland Islands. Hooker described the library as &#x27;excellent&#x27;, and developed a close friendship with Moody.

===Marriages and children===

In 1851, he married Frances Harriet Henslow (1825–1874), daughter of Darwin&#x27;s mentor, John Stevens Henslow. They had three daughters and four sons:
* William Henslow Hooker (1853–1942)
* Harriet Anne Hooker (1854–1945) married William Turner Thiselton-Dyer
* Charles Paget Hooker (1855–1933)
* Maria Elizabeth Hooker (1857–1863) died aged 6.
* Brian Harvey Hodgson Hooker (1860–1932)
* Reginald Hawthorn Hooker (1867–1944) statistician
* Grace Ellen Hooker (1868–1955)

Frances Harriet Henslow&#x27;s contribution to his work included translating French botanical texts which Hooker edited.

After his first wife&#x27;s death in 1874, in 1876 he married Lady Hyacinth Jardine (1842–1921), daughter of William Samuel Symonds and the widow of Sir William Jardine. They had two sons:
* Joseph Symonds Hooker (1877–1940)
* Richard Symonds Hooker (1885–1950).

Lady Hooker was elected a Fellow of the RSPB in 1905.

=== Sons Willy and Brian ===
Hooker regularly corresponded with the chief government scientist in New Zealand, Sir James Hector. He sent his son Willy (aged 15) to stay in New Zealand with the recently married Hector in 1869, Willy was sickly and coughing up blood, and a warmer climate was recommended. Though well-behaved he was indolent. Hector sent him on a cruise on a Government steamer the &quot;Sturt&quot; with a son (also 15) of Colonel Haultain the Defence minister. Mrs Hector treated him like a younger brother. After eight months and in better health Hector sent him home to England, saying he had greatly improved. His father was grateful, and surprised when Willy passed the civil service examination. He got an administrative job in the India Office, and lived to age 89.

However, his third son, Brian, was a &quot;great worry&quot; to him. He qualified as a geologist and mining engineer at the Royal School of Mines but unable to get a job in Britain emigrated to Australia, where he married. He resigned a Queensland lectureship to invest (with his brother Willy) in an impressively named but cash-strapped gold-mining company which collapsed, the Queensland Minerals Exploration Company. Joseph was appalled; Brian could not support his wife and children or find employment.

In 1891, Hector sent a pessimistic report on a proposed tin mine on Stewart Island, and saw Brian in 1892 and 1893, after he left his family in Australia. Hector ceased to be involved with mining in New Zealand under the new Liberal government. Brian returned to his family in Australia in 1894.

===Death and burial===
On 10 December 1911, after a short and apparently minor illness, Hooker died in his sleep at home, the Camp, Sunningdale, Berkshire. The Dean and Chapter of Westminster Abbey offered a grave near Darwin&#x27;s in the nave but insisted that Hooker be cremated before.

His widow, Hyacinth, declined the proposal and eventually Hooker&#x27;s body was buried, as he wished to be, alongside his father in the churchyard of St Anne&#x27;s Church, Kew, a short distance from Kew Gardens. His memorial tablet in the church, with a motif of five plants, was designed by Matilda Smith.

==Work==

=== Voyage to the Antarctic 1839–1843 ===
Hooker&#x27;s first expedition, led by James Clark Ross, consisted of two ships, and ; it was the last major voyage of exploration made entirely under sail. Hooker was the youngest of the 128-man crew. He sailed on the &quot;Erebus&quot; and was assistant to Robert McCormick, who in addition to being the ship&#x27;s Surgeon was instructed to collect zoological and geological specimens. The ships sailed on 30 September 1839. Before journeying to Antarctica they visited Madeira, Tenerife, Santiago and Quail Island in the Cape Verde archipelago, St Paul Rocks, Trindade east of Brazil, St Helena, and the Cape of Good Hope. Hooker made plant collections at each location and while travelling drew these and specimens of algae and sea life pulled aboard using tow nets.

From the Cape they entered the Southern Ocean. Their first stop was the Crozet Islands where they set down on Possession Island to deliver coffee to sealers. They departed for the Kerguelen Islands where they would spend several days. Hooker identified 18 flowering plants, 35 mosses and liverworts, 25 lichens and 51 algae, including some that were not described by surgeon William Anderson when James Cook had visited the islands in 1772. The expedition spent some time in Hobart, Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, and then moved on to the Auckland Islands and Campbell Island, and onward to Antarctica to locate the South Magnetic Pole. After spending 5 months in the Antarctic they returned to resupply in Hobart, then went on to Sydney, and the Bay of Islands in New Zealand from 18 August to 23 November 1841. They left New Zealand to return to Antarctica. After spending 138 days at sea, and a collision between the &quot;Erebus&quot; and &quot;Terror,&quot; they sailed to the Falkland Islands, to Tierra del Fuego, back to the Falklands and onward to their third sortie into the Antarctic. When Hooker arrived on the Falkland Islands with the expedition of Ross, he developed a close friendship with Richard Clement Moody, the Governor of the Falkland Islands. Moody granted Hooker full use of his personal library, which Hooker described as &#x27;excellent&#x27;, and Hooker described Moody as &#x27;a very active and intelligent young man, most anxious to improve the colony and gain every information respecting its products&#x27;.

Subsequently, the Ross expedition made a landing at Cockburn Island off the Antarctic Peninsula, and after leaving the Antarctic, stopped at the Cape, St Helena and Ascension Island. The ships arrived back in England on 4 September 1843; the voyage had been a success for Ross as it was the first to confirm the existence of the southern continent and chart much of its coastline.

===Geological Survey of Great Britain===
In 1845, Hooker applied for the Chair of Botany at the University of Edinburgh. This position included duties at the Royal Botanic Gardens of Scotland, and so the appointment was influenced by local politicians. An unusually protracted struggle ensued, resulting in the election of the locally born and bred botanist, John Hutton Balfour. The Darwin correspondence, now public, makes clear Darwin&#x27;s sense of shock at this unexpected outcome. Hooker declined a chair at Glasgow University which became vacant on Balfour&#x27;s appointment. Instead, he took a position as botanist to the Geological Survey of Great Britain in 1846. He began work on palaeobotany, searching for fossil plants in the coal-beds of Wales, eventually discovering the first coal ball in 1855. He became engaged to Frances Henslow, daughter of Charles Darwin&#x27;s botany tutor John Stevens Henslow, but he was keen to continue to travel and gain more experience in the field. He wanted to travel to India and the Himalayas. In 1847 his father nominated him to travel to India and collect plants for Kew. In 2011, a collection of glass plate slides of paleontological fossils, some prepared by Darwin, William Nicol and others, which had been lost following Hooker&#x27;s brief tenure with the Survey, were rediscovered in the Survey vaults in Keyworth in Nottinghamshire, and they shed light on the international breadth of English scientific research in the first half of the nineteenth century.

===Voyage to the Himalayas and India 1847–1851===
On 11 November 1847 Hooker left England for his three-year-long Himalayan expedition. This was just 10 days after being granted two and a half years&#x27; leave from the Geological Survey to study fossil plants in India and Borneo on behalf of Kew and the Admiralty. He would be the first European to collect plants in the Himalaya, but abandoned the projected visit to Labuan. He received free passage on , to the Nile and then travelled overland to Suez where he boarded a ship to India. He arrived in Calcutta on 12 January 1848, leaving on 28th to begin his travels with a geological survey party under &#x27;Mr Williams&#x27;, who he left on 3 March to continue travelling by elephant to Mirzapur, up the Ganges by boat to Siliguri and overland by pony to Darjeeling, arriving on 16 April 1848.

Hooker&#x27;s expedition was based in Darjeeling where he stayed with naturalist Brian Houghton Hodgson. Through Hodgson he met British East India Company representative Archibald Campbell who negotiated Hooker&#x27;s admission to Sikkim, which was finally approved in 1849 (He was later briefly taken prisoner by the Raja of Sikkim). Meanwhile, Hooker wrote to Darwin relaying to him the habits of animals in India, and collected plants in Bengal. He explored with local resident Charles Barnes, then travelled along the Great Runjeet river to its junction with the Teesta River and Tonglu mountain in the Singalila range on the border with Nepal.

Hooker and a sizeable party of local assistants departed for eastern Nepal on 27 October 1848. They travelled to Zongri, west over the spurs of Kangchenjunga, and north west along Nepal&#x27;s passes into Tibet. In April 1849 he planned a longer expedition into Sikkim. Leaving on 3May, he travelled north west up the Lachen Valley to the Kongra Lama Pass and then to the Lachoong Pass. Campbell and Hooker were imprisoned by the Dewan of Sikkim as they travelled towards the Cho La in Tibet. A British team was sent to negotiate with the king of Sikkim. However, they were released without any bloodshed and Hooker returned to Darjeeling, where he spent January and February 1850 writing his journals, replacing specimens lost during his detention and planning a journey for his last year in India. According to an 1887 journal written by Indian administrator Richard Temple, many of the rhododendrons found in English gardens of the time were grown from seeds collected by Hooker in Sikkim.

Reluctant to return to Sikkim, and unenthusiastic about travelling in Bhutan, he chose to make his last Himalayan expedition to Sylhet and the Khasi Hills in Assam. He was accompanied by Thomas Thomson, a fellow student from Glasgow University. They left Darjeeling on 1 May 1850, then sailed to the Bay of Bengal and travelled overland by elephant to the Khasi Hills and established a headquarters for their studies in Churra, where they stayed until 9 December, when they began their trip back to England. With Thomson he distributed the exsiccata-like series &quot;Herbarium Indiae orientalis&quot;. 

Hooker&#x27;s survey of hitherto unexplored regions, the &quot;Himalayan Journals&quot;, dedicated to Charles Darwin, was published by the Calcutta Trigonometrical Survey Office in 1854, abbreviated again in 1855 and later by the Minerva Library of Famous Books published by Ward, Lock, Bowden &amp; Co. in 1891.

When Hooker returned to England his father, who had been appointed director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in 1841, was now a prominent man of science. William Hooker, through his connections, secured an Admiralty grant of £1000 to defray the cost of plates for his son&#x27;s &quot;Botany of the Antarctic Voyages&quot;, and an annual stipend of £200 for Joseph while he worked on the flora. Hooker&#x27;s flora was also to include that collected on the voyages of Cook and Menzies held by the British Museum and collections made on the &quot;Beagle&quot;. The floras were illustrated by Walter Hood Fitch (trained in botanical illustration by William Hooker), who would go on to become the most prolific Victorian botanical artist.

Hooker&#x27;s collections from the Antarctic voyage were described eventually in one of two volumes published as the &quot;Flora Antarctica&quot; (1844–47). In the &quot;Flora&quot; he wrote about islands and their role in plant geography: the work made Hooker&#x27;s reputation as a systemist and plant geographer. His works on the voyage were completed with &quot;Flora Novae-Zelandiae&quot; (1851–53) and &quot;Flora Tasmaniae&quot; (1853–59).

=== Voyage to Palestine 1860 ===
This trip was taken in the autumn of 1860, with Daniel Hanbury. They visited and collected in Syria and Palestine; no full-length report was published, but a number of papers were written. Hooker recognised three phytogeographical divisions: Western Syria and Palestine; Eastern Syria and Palestine; Middle and Upper mountain regions of Syria.

=== Voyage to Morocco 1871 ===
Hooker visited Morocco from April to June 1871, in the company of John Ball, George Maw and a young gardener from Kew, called Crump. They published an account of their travels entitled &quot;Journal of a Tour in Marocco and The Great Atlas&quot; (1878).

=== Voyage to Western United States 1877 ===
This was undertaken with his friend Asa Gray, the leading American botanist of the day. They wished to investigate the connection between the floras of eastern United States and those of eastern continental Asia and Japan; and the line of demarcation between Arctic floras of America and Greenland. As probable causes they considered the Glacial periods and an earlier land connection with an Arctic continent. &quot;A difficult question was why in the great mountain chains of the Western United States there appeared to be only a few botanical enclaves of plants of eastern-Asiatic afinities among plants of Mexican and more southern types.&quot;

Hooker visited a number of cities and botanical institutions before moving west and climbing to 9,000 ft to camp at La Veta. From Fort Garland they climbed the Sierra Blanca at 14,500 ft. After returning to La Veta, they went beyond Colorado Springs to Pike&#x27;s Peak. Next to Denver and Salt Lake City for an excursion into the Wasatch Range. A journey of 29 hours took them to Reno and Carson City, then Silver City and ten days by wagon across the Sierra Nevada. Thus they came to the Yosemite and Calaveras Grove, and ended up in San Francisco. Hooker was back in Kew with 1,000 dried specimens by October.

His comments on his encounters include the following:
* After meeting and talking to Brigham Young, whom he described as respectable and well-spoken: &quot;All the school children are brought up to believe in him [Brigham Young], and in a lot of scripture history as useless and idle as that taught in our schools.&quot;
* Of Georgetown: the &quot;finger-tip of civilisation&quot; where &quot;the people sleep without locks to their doors, the fire-engines are well-manned and in capital order, and there is no end of food&quot;.
* &quot;The New Englanders are most like us in language, speech and habits... The Americans are great and promiscuous eaters... beds are remarkably clean and good, but the pillows are too soft.&quot;

His views on the flora of Colorado and Utah: There are two temperate, and two cold or mountain floras, viz: 1. a prairie flora derived from the eastward; 2. a so-called desert and saline flora derived from the west; 3. a sub-alpine; 4. an alpine flora, the two latter of widely different origin, and in one sense proper to the Rocky Mountain ranges.

His overview of North American flora contained these elements:
:Polar area, from the Behring Strait to Greenland.
:British North American flora, south of the Arctic flora, in five meridional belts.
:United States flora, in belts:
::The Great Eastern Forest region, from the Atlantic to beyond the Mississippi.
::The Prairie region.
::The Sink region, confined to gullies of the mountains.
::The Sierra Nevada.

===Darwin and evolution===
While on the &quot;Erebus&quot;, Hooker had read proofs of Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Voyage of the Beagle&quot; provided by Charles Lyell and had been very impressed by Darwin&#x27;s skill as a naturalist. They had met once, before the Antarctic voyage embarked. After Hooker&#x27;s return to England, he was approached by Darwin who invited him to classify the plants that Darwin had collected in South America and the Galápagos Islands. Hooker agreed and the pair began a lifelong friendship. On 11 January 1844 Darwin mentioned to Hooker his early ideas on the transmutation of species and natural selection, and Hooker showed interest. In 1847 he agreed to read Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Essay&quot; explaining the theory, and responded with notes giving Darwin calm critical feedback. Their correspondence continued throughout the development of Darwin&#x27;s theory and in 1858 Darwin wrote that Hooker was &quot;the one living soul from whom I have constantly received sympathy&quot;.

 wrote &quot;Hooker was Charles Darwin&#x27;s greatest friend and confidant&quot;. Certainly they had extensive correspondence, and they also met face-to-face (Hooker visiting Darwin). Hooker and Lyell were the two people Darwin consulted (by letter) when Alfred Russel Wallace&#x27;s famous letter arrived at Down House, enclosing his paper on natural selection. Hooker was instrumental in creating the device whereby the Wallace paper was accompanied by Darwin&#x27;s notes and his letter to Asa Gray (showing his prior realisation of natural selection) in a presentation to the Linnean Society. Hooker was the one who formally presented this material to the Linnean Society meeting in 1858. In 1859 the author of &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; recorded his indebtedness to Hooker&#x27;s wide knowledge and balanced judgment.

In December 1859, Hooker published the &quot;Introductory Essay to the Flora Tasmaniae&quot;, the final part of the Botany of the Antarctic Voyage. It was in this essay (which appeared just one month after the publication of Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;), that Hooker announced his support for the theory of evolution by natural selection, thus becoming the first recognised man of science to publicly back Darwin.

At the historic debate on evolution held at the Oxford University Museum on 30 June 1860, Bishop Samuel Wilberforce, Benjamin Brodie and Robert FitzRoy spoke against Darwin&#x27;s theory, and Hooker and Thomas Henry Huxley defended it. According to Hooker&#x27;s own account, it was he and not Huxley who delivered the most effective reply to Wilberforce&#x27;s arguments.

Hooker acted as president of the British Association at its Norwich meeting of 1868, when his address was remarkable for its championship of Darwinian theories. He was a close friend of Thomas Henry Huxley, a member of the X-Club (which dominated the Royal Society in the 1870s and early 1880s), and the first of the three X-Clubbers in succession to become President of the Royal Society. In 1862, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

===Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew===
By his travels and his publications, Hooker built up a high scientific reputation at home. In 1855 he was appointed Assistant-Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, and in 1865 he succeeded his father as full Director, holding the post for twenty years. Under the directorship of father and son Hooker, the Royal Botanic gardens of Kew rose to world renown. At the age of thirty, Hooker was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1873 he was chosen its president (till 1877). He received three of its medals: the Royal Medal in 1854, the Copley in 1887 and the Darwin Medal in 1892. He continued to intersperse work at Kew with foreign exploration and collecting. His journeys to Palestine, Morocco and the United States all produced valuable information and specimens for Kew.

He started the series &quot;Flora Indica&quot; in 1855, together with Thomas Thompson. Their botanical observations and the publication of the &quot;Rhododendrons of Sikkim–Himalaya&quot; (1849–51), formed the basis of elaborate works on the rhododendrons of the Sikkim Himalaya and on the flora of India. His works were illustrated with lithographs by Walter Hood Fitch.

His greatest botanical work was the &quot;Flora of British India&quot;, published in seven volumes starting in 1872. On the publication of the last part in 1897, he was promoted Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Star of India (being made a Knight Commander of that Order in 1877). Ten years later, on attaining the age of ninety in 1907, he was awarded the Order of Merit.

He was the author of numerous scientific papers and monographs, and his larger books included, in addition to those already mentioned, a standard &quot;Students Flora of the British Isles&quot; and a monumental work, the &quot;Genera plantarum&quot; (1860–83), based on the collections at Kew, in which he had the assistance of George Bentham. His collaboration with George Bentham was especially important. Bentham, an amateur botanist who worked at Kew for many years, was perhaps the leading botanical systematist of the 19th century. &quot;The Handbook of the British flora&quot;, begun by Bentham and completed by Hooker, was the standard text for a hundred years. It was always known as &#x27;Bentham &amp; Hooker&#x27;.

In 1904, at the age of 87, Hooker published &quot;A sketch of the Vegetation of the Indian Empire&quot;. He continued the compilation of his father Sir William Jackson Hooker&#x27;s project, Icones Plantarum (Illustrations of Plants), producing volumes eleven through nineteen, with most of the illustrations being prepared for him by Matilda Smith.

====Attacks on Hooker and on Kew====
The Herbarium at Kew was founded in 1853, and quickly grew in size and importance. At the time, Richard Owen was the Superintendent of the natural history departments of the British Museum, reporting only to the Head of the British Museum. Hooker, appointed in 1855 as Assistant Director of Kew, was the man most responsible for bringing foreign specimens to Kew.

The relationship between the two men continued to deteriorate after Hooker became a supporter of Darwin&#x27;s views and a member of the X-Club, who set out to get their way with the Royal Society. In 1868 Hooker had proposed that the whole of the huge herbarium collection of Joseph Banks should be moved from the British Museum to Kew, a reasonable idea, but a threat to Owen&#x27;s plans for a museum in South Kensington to house the natural history collections. Hooker cited mismanagement at the British Museum as a justification.

After Joseph had succeeded his father as Director, in 1865, the independence of Kew was seriously threatened by the machinations of a member of parliament, Acton Smee Ayrton, whose appointment as First Commissioner of Works by Gladstone in 1869 was greeted in &quot;The Times&quot; with the prophecy that it would prove &quot;another instance of Mr. Ayrton&#x27;s unfortunate tendency to carry out what he thinks right in as unpleasant a manner as possible&quot;. This was relevant because Kew was funded by the Board of Works, and the Director of Kew reported to the First Commissioner. The conflict between the two men lasted from 1870 to 1872, and there is a voluminous correspondence on the Ayrton Episode held at Kew.

Ayrton behaved in an extraordinary way, interfering in matters and approaching Hooker&#x27;s colleagues behind his back, apparently with the aim of getting Hooker to resign, when the expenditure on Kew could be curtailed and diverted. Ayrton actually took staff appointments out of Hooker&#x27;s hands. He seemed not to value the scientific work, and to believe Kew should be just an amusement park. Hooker wrote:

Finally, Hooker asked to be put in communication with Gladstone&#x27;s private secretary, Algernon West. A statement was drawn up over the signatures of Darwin, Lyell, Huxley, Tyndall, Bentham and others. It was laid before Parliament by John Lubbock, and additional papers laid before the House of Lords. Lord Derby called for all the correspondence on the matter. The Treasury supported Hooker and criticised Ayrton&#x27;s behaviour.

One extraordinary fact emerged. There had been an official report on Kew, which had not previously been seen in public, which Ayrton had caused to be written by Richard Owen. Hooker had not seen the report, and so had not been given right of reply. Nonetheless, the report was amongst the papers laid before Parliament, and it contained an attack on both the Hookers, and suggested (amongst much else) that they had mismanaged the care of their trees, and that their systematic approach to botany was nothing more than &quot;attaching barbarous binomials to foreign weeds&quot;. The discovery of this report no doubt helped to sway opinion in favour of Hooker and Kew (there was debate in the press as well as Parliament). Hooker replied to the Owen report in a point by point factual manner, and his reply was placed with the other papers on the case. When Ayrton was questioned about it in the debate led by Lubbock, he replied that &quot;Hooker was too low an official to raise questions of matter with a Minister of the Crown&quot;.

The outcome was not a vote in the Commons, but a kind of truce until, in August 1874, Gladstone transferred Ayrton from the Board of Works to the office of Judge Advocate-General, just before his government fell. Ayrton failed to get re-elected to Parliament. From that moment to this, the value of the Botanic Gardens has never been seriously questioned. In the midst of this crisis, Hooker was elected as President of the Royal Society in 1873. This showed publicly the high regard which Hooker&#x27;s fellow scientists had for him, and the great importance they attached to his work.

<text>The governor-general of the Union of South Africa (; ) was the highest state official in the Union of South Africa between 1910 and 1961. The Union of South Africa was founded as a self-governing Dominion of the British Empire in 1910 and the office of governor-general was established as the representative of the monarch of South Africa. Fifty-one years later, the country declared itself a republic and the office of governor-general was abolished.

Some of the first holders of the post were members of the British royal family including Prince Arthur of Connaught between 1920 and 1924, and Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone, who served between 1924 and 1931, before becoming the governor general of Canada. As in other Dominions, this would change, and from 1943 onward only South Africans (in fact, only Afrikaners) held the office.

The office was established by the South Africa Act 1909. Until the Balfour Declaration of 1926 the governor-general was the representative of the British government in South Africa and was appointed by the Colonial Office in London. After the declaration and the Statute of Westminster 1931 the governor-general was appointed by the monarch on the advice of the South African government. Although the governor-general was nominally the country&#x27;s chief executive, in practice he was bound by convention to act on the advice of the prime minister and the cabinet of South Africa.

<text>In quantum physics an anomaly or quantum anomaly is the failure of a symmetry of a theory&#x27;s classical action to be a symmetry of any regularization of the full quantum theory. 
In classical physics, a classical anomaly is the failure of a symmetry to be restored in the limit in which the symmetry-breaking parameter goes to zero. Perhaps the first known anomaly was the dissipative anomaly in turbulence: time-reversibility remains broken (and energy dissipation rate finite) at the limit of vanishing viscosity. 

In quantum theory, the first anomaly discovered was the Adler–Bell–Jackiw anomaly, wherein the axial vector current is conserved as a classical symmetry of electrodynamics, but is broken by the quantized theory. The relationship of this anomaly to the Atiyah–Singer index theorem was one of the celebrated achievements of the theory. Technically, an anomalous symmetry in a quantum theory is a symmetry of the action, but not of the measure, and so not of the partition function as a whole.

==Global anomalies==

A global anomaly is the quantum violation of a global symmetry current conservation. 
A global anomaly can also mean that a non-perturbative global anomaly cannot be captured by one loop or any loop perturbative Feynman diagram calculations—examples include the Witten anomaly and Wang–Wen–Witten anomaly.

===Scaling and renormalization===

The most prevalent global anomaly in physics is associated with the violation of scale invariance by quantum corrections, quantified in renormalization.
Since regulators generally introduce a distance scale, the classically scale-invariant theories are subject to renormalization group flow, i.e., changing behavior with energy scale. For example, the large strength of the strong nuclear force results from a theory that is weakly coupled at short distances flowing to a strongly coupled theory at long distances, due to this scale anomaly.

===Rigid symmetries===

Anomalies in abelian global symmetries pose no problems in a quantum field theory, and are often encountered (see the example of the chiral anomaly). In particular the corresponding anomalous symmetries can be fixed by fixing the boundary conditions of the path integral.

===Large gauge transformations===

Global anomalies in symmetries that approach the identity sufficiently quickly at infinity do, however, pose problems. In known examples such symmetries correspond to disconnected components of gauge symmetries. Such symmetries and possible anomalies occur, for example, in theories with chiral fermions or self-dual differential forms coupled to gravity in 4&quot;k&quot; + 2 dimensions, and also in the Witten anomaly in an ordinary 4-dimensional SU(2) gauge theory.

As these symmetries vanish at infinity, they cannot be constrained by boundary conditions and so must be summed over in the path integral. The sum of the gauge orbit of a state is a sum of phases which form a subgroup of U(1). As there is an anomaly, not all of these phases are the same, therefore it is not the identity subgroup. The sum of the phases in every other subgroup of U(1) is equal to zero, and so all path integrals are equal to zero when there is such an anomaly and a theory does not exist.

An exception may occur when the space of configurations is itself disconnected, in which case one may have the freedom to choose to integrate over any
subset of the components. If the disconnected gauge symmetries map the system between disconnected configurations, then there is in general a consistent truncation of a theory in which one integrates only over those connected components that are not related by large gauge transformations. In this case the large gauge transformations do not act on the system and do not cause the path integral to vanish.

====Witten anomaly and Wang–Wen–Witten anomaly====

In SU(2) gauge theory in 4 dimensional Minkowski space, a gauge transformation corresponds to a choice of an element of the special unitary group SU(2) at each point in spacetime. The group of such gauge transformations is connected.

However, if we are only interested in the subgroup of gauge transformations that vanish at infinity, we may consider the 3-sphere at infinity to be a single point, as the gauge transformations vanish there anyway. If the 3-sphere at infinity is identified with a point, our Minkowski space is identified with the 4-sphere. Thus we see that the group of gauge transformations vanishing at infinity in Minkowski 4-space is isomorphic to the group of all gauge transformations on the 4-sphere.

This is the group which consists of a continuous choice of a gauge transformation in SU(2) for each point on the 4-sphere. In other words, the gauge symmetries are in one-to-one correspondence with maps from the 4-sphere to the 3-sphere, which is the group manifold of SU(2). The space of such maps is &quot;not&quot; connected, instead the connected components are classified by the fourth homotopy group of the 3-sphere which is the cyclic group of order two. In particular, there are two connected components. One contains the identity and is called the &quot;identity component&quot;, the other is called the &quot;disconnected component&quot;.

When a theory contains an odd number of flavors of chiral fermions, the actions of gauge symmetries in the identity component and the disconnected component of the gauge group on a physical state differ by a sign. Thus when one sums over all physical configurations in the path integral, one finds that contributions come in pairs with opposite signs. As a result, all path integrals vanish and a theory does not exist.

The above description of a global anomaly is for the SU(2) gauge theory coupled to an odd number of (iso-)spin-1/2 Weyl fermion in 4 spacetime dimensions. This is known as the Witten SU(2) anomaly. In 2018, it is found by Wang, Wen and Witten that the SU(2) gauge theory coupled to an odd number of (iso-)spin-3/2 Weyl fermion in 4 spacetime dimensions has a further subtler non-perturbative global anomaly detectable on certain non-spin manifolds without spin structure. This new anomaly is called the new SU(2) anomaly. Both types of anomalies have analogs of (1) dynamical gauge anomalies for dynamical gauge theories and (2) the &#x27;t Hooft anomalies of global symmetries. In addition, both types of anomalies are mod 2 classes (in terms of classification, they are both finite groups Z&quot;2&quot; of order 2 classes), and have analogs in 4 and 5 spacetime dimensions. More generally, for any natural integer N, it can be shown that an odd number of fermion multiplets in representations of (iso)-spin 2N+1/2 can have the SU(2) anomaly; an odd number of fermion multiplets in representations of (iso)-spin 4N+3/2 can have the new SU(2) anomaly. For fermions in the half-integer spin representation, it is shown that there are only these two types of SU(2) anomalies and the linear combinations of these two anomalies; these classify all global SU(2) anomalies. This new SU(2) anomaly also plays an important rule for confirming the consistency of SO(10) grand unified theory, with a Spin(10) gauge group and chiral fermions in the 16-dimensional spinor representations, defined on non-spin manifolds.

===Higher anomalies involving higher global symmetries: Pure Yang–Mills gauge theory as an example===

The concept of global symmetries can be generalized to higher global symmetries, such that the charged object for the ordinary 0-form symmetry is a particle, while the charged object for the n-form symmetry is an n-dimensional extended operator. It is found that the 4 dimensional pure Yang–Mills theory with only SU(2) gauge fields with a topological theta term formula_1 can have a mixed higher &#x27;t Hooft anomaly between the 0-form time-reversal symmetry and 1-form Z&quot;2&quot; center symmetry. The &#x27;t Hooft anomaly of 4 dimensional pure Yang–Mills theory can be precisely written as a 5 dimensional invertible topological field theory or mathematically a 5 dimensional bordism invariant, generalizing the anomaly inflow picture to this Z&quot;2&quot; class of global anomaly involving higher symmetries. In other words, we can regard the 4 dimensional pure Yang–Mills theory with a topological theta term formula_2 live as a boundary condition of a certain Z&quot;2&quot; class invertible topological field theory, in order to match their higher anomalies on the 4 dimensional boundary.

==Gauge anomalies==

Anomalies in gauge symmetries lead to an inconsistency, since a gauge symmetry is required in order to cancel unphysical degrees of freedom with a negative norm (such as a photon polarized in the time direction). An attempt to cancel them—i.e., to build theories consistent with the gauge symmetries—often leads to extra constraints on the theories (such is the case of the gauge anomaly in the Standard Model of particle physics). Anomalies in gauge theories have important connections to the topology and geometry of the gauge group.

Anomalies in gauge symmetries can be calculated exactly at the one-loop level. At tree level (zero loops), one reproduces the classical theory. Feynman diagrams with more than one loop always contain internal boson propagators. As bosons may always be given a mass without breaking gauge invariance, a Pauli–Villars regularization of such diagrams is possible while preserving the symmetry. Whenever the regularization of a diagram is consistent with a given symmetry, that diagram does not generate an anomaly with respect to the symmetry.

Vector gauge anomalies are always chiral anomalies. Another type of gauge anomaly is the gravitational anomaly.

==At different energy scales==

Quantum anomalies were discovered via the process of renormalization, when some divergent integrals cannot be regularized in such a way that all the symmetries are preserved simultaneously. This is related to the high energy physics. However, due to Gerard &#x27;t Hooft&#x27;s anomaly matching condition, any chiral anomaly can be described either by the UV degrees of freedom (those relevant at high energies) or by the IR degrees of freedom (those relevant at low energies). Thus one cannot cancel an anomaly by a UV completion of a theory—an anomalous symmetry is simply not a symmetry of a theory, even though classically it appears to be.

==Anomaly cancellation==

Since cancelling anomalies is necessary for the consistency of gauge theories, such cancellations are of central importance in constraining the fermion content of the standard model, which is a chiral gauge theory.

For example, the vanishing of the mixed anomaly involving two SU(2) generators and one U(1) hypercharge constrains all charges in a fermion generation to add up to zero, and thereby dictates that the sum of the proton plus the sum of the electron vanish: the &quot;charges of quarks and leptons must be commensurate&quot;.
Specifically, for two external gauge fields , and one hypercharge at the vertices of the triangle diagram, cancellation of the triangle requires
:formula_3 
so, for each generation, the charges of the leptons and quarks are balanced, formula_4, whence .

The anomaly cancelation in SM was also used to predict a quark from 3rd generation, the top quark.

Further such mechanisms include:
* Axion
* Chern–Simons
* Green–Schwarz mechanism
* Liouville action

==Anomalies and cobordism==

In the modern description of anomalies classified by cobordism theory, the Feynman-Dyson graphs only captures the perturbative local anomalies classified by integer Z classes also known as the free part. There exists nonperturbative global anomalies classified by cyclic groups Z/&quot;n&quot;Z classes also known as the torsion part.

It is widely known and checked in the late 20th century that the standard model and chiral gauge theories are free from perturbative local anomalies (captured by Feynman diagrams). However, it is not entirely clear whether there are any nonperturbative global anomalies for the standard model and chiral gauge theories. 
Recent developments 
based on the cobordism theory examine this problem, and several additional nontrivial global anomalies found can further constrain these gauge theories. There is also a formulation of both perturbative local and nonperturbative global description of anomaly inflow in terms of Atiyah, Patodi, and Singer

 eta invariant in one higher dimension. This eta invariant is a cobordism invariant whenever the perturbative local anomalies vanish. 

== Examples ==
* Chiral anomaly
* Conformal anomaly (anomaly of scale invariance)
* Gauge anomaly
* Global anomaly
* Gravitational anomaly (also known as &quot;diffeomorphism anomaly&quot;)
* Konishi anomaly
* Mixed anomaly
* Parity anomaly
* &#x27;t Hooft anomaly

<text>Guillaume Durand (died 1328 or 1330) was a French clergyman, a nephew of a more famous Guillaume Durand, nicknamed &quot;The Speculator&quot;.

Like his uncle, he was a canonist, was rector of the University of Toulouse and succeeded his uncle as Bishop of Mende.
Pope John XXII and Charles IV of France sent him on an embassy to the Sultan Orhan (1326–1360) at Brusa, to obtain more favourable conditions for the Latins in Syria. He died on the way back, in Cyprus (1328 or 1330).

==Works==
He wrote in 1311, by command of Clement V and in connection with the Council of Vienne, &quot;De modo celebrandi concilii et corruptelis in Ecclesia reformandis&quot;, in three books. It attacks the abuses of the Church with extreme sincerity and vigour. It is a treatise on the canonical process of summoning and holding general councils, gathered from approved sources with many quotations and illustrations from the Church Fathers and from church history, together with attacks on various abuses and corruptions that were common in the fourteenth century among ecclesiastical persons. This treatise illustrates the role of traditional ideas in the formation of conciliarism, the idea that a church council could regulate the papacy. The first edition was printed at Lyons in 1531, then again at Paris by Philip Probus, a canonist of Bourges, in 1545, and dedicated to Pope Paul III as a help towards the Council of Trent. Other editions, Paris, 1671, etc.

In 1319, he wrote treatise on the recovery of the Holy Land for King Philip V, entitled &quot;Informacio brevis&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, specifically algebraic geometry, a scheme is a structure that enlarges the notion of algebraic variety in several ways, such as taking account of multiplicities (the equations and define the same algebraic variety but different schemes) and allowing &quot;varieties&quot; defined over any commutative ring (for example, Fermat curves are defined over the integers). 

Scheme theory was introduced by Alexander Grothendieck in 1960 in his treatise &quot;Éléments de géométrie algébrique&quot; (EGA); one of its aims was developing the formalism needed to solve deep problems of algebraic geometry, such as the Weil conjectures (the last of which was proved by Pierre Deligne). Strongly based on commutative algebra, scheme theory allows a systematic use of methods of topology and homological algebra. Scheme theory also unifies algebraic geometry with much of number theory, which eventually led to Wiles&#x27;s proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. 

Schemes elaborate the fundamental idea that an algebraic variety is best analyzed through the coordinate ring of regular algebraic functions defined on it (or on its subsets), and each subvariety corresponds to the ideal of functions which vanish on the subvariety. Intuitively, a scheme is a topological space consisting of closed points which correspond to geometric points, together with non-closed points which are generic points of irreducible subvarieties. The space is covered by an atlas of open sets, each endowed with a coordinate ring of regular functions, with specified coordinate changes between the functions over intersecting open sets. Such a structure is called a ringed space or a sheaf of rings. The cases of main interest are the Noetherian schemes, in which the coordinate rings are Noetherian rings.

Formally, a scheme is a ringed space covered by affine schemes. An affine scheme is the spectrum of a commutative ring; its points are the prime ideals of the ring, and its closed points are maximal ideals. The coordinate ring of an affine scheme is the ring itself, and the coordinate rings of open subsets are rings of fractions.

The relative point of view is that much of algebraic geometry should be developed for a morphism of schemes (called a scheme over the base ), rather than for an individual scheme. For example, in studying algebraic surfaces, it can be useful to consider families of algebraic surfaces over any scheme . In many cases, the family of all varieties of a given type can itself be viewed as a variety or scheme, known as a moduli space.

For some of the detailed definitions in the theory of schemes, see the glossary of scheme theory.

==Development==
The origins of algebraic geometry mostly lie in the study of polynomial equations over the real numbers. By the 19th century, it became clear (notably in the work of Jean-Victor Poncelet and Bernhard Riemann) that algebraic geometry over the real numbers is simplified by working over the field of complex numbers, which has the advantage of being algebraically closed. The early 20th century saw analogies between algebraic geometry and number theory, suggesting the question: can algebraic geometry be developed over other fields, such as those with positive characteristic, and more generally over number rings like the integers, where the tools of topology and complex analysis used to study complex varieties do not seem to apply?

Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz suggests an approach to algebraic geometry over any algebraically closed field : the maximal ideals in the polynomial ring are in one-to-one correspondence with the set of -tuples of elements of , and the prime ideals correspond to the irreducible algebraic sets in , known as affine varieties. Motivated by these ideas, Emmy Noether and Wolfgang Krull developed commutative algebra in the 1920s and 1930s. Their work generalizes algebraic geometry in a purely algebraic direction, generalizing the study of points (maximal ideals in a polynomial ring) to the study of prime ideals in any commutative ring. For example, Krull defined the dimension of a commutative ring in terms of prime ideals and, at least when the ring is Noetherian, he proved that this definition satisfies many of the intuitive properties of geometric dimension.

Noether and Krull&#x27;s commutative algebra can be viewed as an algebraic approach to &quot;affine&quot; algebraic varieties. However, many arguments in algebraic geometry work better for projective varieties, essentially because they are compact. From the 1920s to the 1940s, B. L. van der Waerden, André Weil and Oscar Zariski applied commutative algebra as a new foundation for algebraic geometry in the richer setting of projective (or quasi-projective) varieties. In particular, the Zariski topology is a useful topology on a variety over any algebraically closed field, replacing to some extent the classical topology on a complex variety (based on the metric topology of the complex numbers).

For applications to number theory, van der Waerden and Weil formulated algebraic geometry over any field, not necessarily algebraically closed. Weil was the first to define an &quot;abstract variety&quot; (not embedded in projective space), by gluing affine varieties along open subsets, on the model of abstract manifolds in topology. He needed this generality for his construction of the Jacobian variety of a curve over any field. (Later, Jacobians were shown to be projective varieties by Weil, Chow and Matsusaka.)

The algebraic geometers of the Italian school had often used the somewhat foggy concept of the generic point of an algebraic variety. What is true for the generic point is true for &quot;most&quot; points of the variety. In Weil&#x27;s &quot;Foundations of Algebraic Geometry&quot; (1946), generic points are constructed by taking points in a very large algebraically closed field, called a &quot;universal domain&quot;. This worked awkwardly: there were many different generic points for the same variety. (In the later theory of schemes, each algebraic variety has a single generic point.)

In the 1950s, Claude Chevalley, Masayoshi Nagata and Jean-Pierre Serre, motivated in part by the Weil conjectures relating number theory and algebraic geometry, further extended the objects of algebraic geometry, for example by generalizing the base rings allowed. The word &quot;scheme&quot; was first used in the 1956 Chevalley Seminar, in which Chevalley pursued Zariski&#x27;s ideas. According to Pierre Cartier, it was André Martineau who suggested to Serre the possibility of using the spectrum of an arbitrary commutative ring as a foundation for algebraic geometry.

==Origin of schemes==
The theory took its definitive form in Grothendieck&#x27;s &quot;Éléments de géométrie algébrique&quot; (EGA) and the later &quot;Séminaire de géométrie algébrique&quot; (SGA), bringing to a conclusion a generation of experimental suggestions and partial developments. Grothendieck defined the spectrum formula_1 of a commutative ring formula_2 as the space of prime ideals of formula_2 with a natural topology (known as the Zariski topology), but augmented it with a sheaf of rings: to every open subset formula_4 he assigned a commutative ring formula_5, which may be thought of as the coordinate ring of regular functions on formula_4. These objects formula_7 are the affine schemes; a general scheme is then obtained by &quot;gluing together&quot; affine schemes.

Much of algebraic geometry focuses on projective or quasi-projective varieties over a field formula_8, most often over the complex numbers. Grothendieck developed a large body of theory for arbitrary schemes extending much of the geometric intuition for varieties. For example, it is common to construct a moduli space first as a scheme, and only later study whether it is a more concrete object such as a projective variety. Applying Grothendieck&#x27;s theory to schemes over the integers and other number fields led to powerful new perspectives in number theory.

==Definition==
An affine scheme is a locally ringed space isomorphic to the spectrum formula_7 of a commutative ring formula_2. A scheme is a locally ringed space formula_1 admitting a covering by open sets formula_12, such that each formula_12 (as a locally ringed space) is an affine scheme. In particular, formula_1 comes with a sheaf formula_15, which assigns to every open subset formula_4 a commutative ring formula_5 called the ring of regular functions on formula_4. One can think of a scheme as being covered by &quot;coordinate charts&quot; that are affine schemes. The definition means exactly that schemes are obtained by gluing together affine schemes using the Zariski topology. 

In the early days, this was called a &quot;prescheme&quot;, and a scheme was defined to be a separated prescheme. The term prescheme has fallen out of use, but can still be found in older books, such as Grothendieck&#x27;s &quot;Éléments de géométrie algébrique&quot; and Mumford&#x27;s &quot;Red Book&quot;. The sheaf properties of formula_5 mean that its elements&quot;,&quot; which are not necessarily functions, can neverthess be patched together from their restrictions in the same way as functions.

A basic example of an affine scheme is affine formula_20-space over a field formula_8, for a natural number formula_20. By definition, formula_23 is the spectrum of the polynomial ring formula_24. In the spirit of scheme theory, affine formula_20-space can in fact be defined over any commutative ring formula_2, meaning formula_27.

==The category of schemes==
Schemes form a category, with morphisms defined as morphisms of locally ringed spaces. (See also: morphism of schemes.) For a scheme &quot;Y&quot;, a scheme &quot;X&quot; over &quot;Y&quot; (or a &quot;Y&quot;-scheme) means a morphism &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; of schemes. A scheme &quot;X&quot; over a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; means a morphism &quot;X&quot; → Spec(&quot;R&quot;).

An algebraic variety over a field &quot;k&quot; can be defined as a scheme over &quot;k&quot; with certain properties. There are different conventions about exactly which schemes should be called varieties. One standard choice is that a variety over &quot;k&quot; means an integral separated scheme of finite type over &quot;k&quot;.

A morphism &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; of schemes determines a pullback homomorphism on the rings of regular functions, &quot;f&quot;*: &quot;O&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;) → &quot;O&quot;(&quot;X&quot;). In the case of affine schemes, this construction gives a one-to-one correspondence between morphisms Spec(&quot;A&quot;) → Spec(&quot;B&quot;) of schemes and ring homomorphisms &quot;B&quot; → &quot;A&quot;. In this sense, scheme theory completely subsumes the theory of commutative rings.

Since Z is an initial object in the category of commutative rings, the category of schemes has Spec(Z) as a terminal object.

For a scheme &quot;X&quot; over a commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, an &quot;R&quot;-point of &quot;X&quot; means a section of the morphism &quot;X&quot; → Spec(&quot;R&quot;). One writes &quot;X&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) for the set of &quot;R&quot;-points of &quot;X&quot;. In examples, this definition reconstructs the old notion of the set of solutions of the defining equations of &quot;X&quot; with values in &quot;R&quot;. When &quot;R&quot; is a field &quot;k&quot;, &quot;X&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) is also called the set of &quot;k&quot;-rational points of &quot;X&quot;.

More generally, for a scheme &quot;X&quot; over a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; and any commutative &quot;R&quot;-algebra &quot;S&quot;, an &quot;S&quot;-point of &quot;X&quot; means a morphism Spec(&quot;S&quot;) → &quot;X&quot; over &quot;R&quot;. One writes &quot;X&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) for the set of &quot;S&quot;-points of &quot;X&quot;. (This generalizes the old observation that given some equations over a field &quot;k&quot;, one can consider the set of solutions of the equations in any field extension &quot;E&quot; of &quot;k&quot;.) For a scheme &quot;X&quot; over &quot;R&quot;, the assignment &quot;S&quot; ↦ &quot;X&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) is a functor from commutative &quot;R&quot;-algebras to sets. It is an important observation that a scheme &quot;X&quot; over &quot;R&quot; is determined by this functor of points.

The fiber product of schemes always exists. That is, for any schemes &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; with morphisms to a scheme &quot;Y&quot;, the categorical fiber product formula_28 exists in the category of schemes. If &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; are schemes over a field &quot;k&quot;, their fiber product over Spec(&quot;k&quot;) may be called the product &quot;X&quot; × &quot;Z&quot; in the category of &quot;k&quot;-schemes. For example, the product of affine spaces formula_29 and formula_30 over &quot;k&quot; is affine space formula_31 over &quot;k&quot;.

Since the category of schemes has fiber products and also a terminal object Spec(Z), it has all finite limits.

==Examples==
Here and below, all the rings considered are commutative.

=== Affine space ===
Let formula_8 be an algebraically closed field. The affine space formula_33 is the algebraic variety of all points formula_34 with coordinates in formula_8; its coordinate ring is the polynomial ring formula_36. The corresponding scheme formula_37 is a topological space with the Zariski topology, whose closed points are the maximal ideals formula_38, the set of polynomials vanishing at formula_39. The scheme also contains a non-closed point for each non-maximal prime ideal formula_40, whose vanishing defines an irreducible subvariety formula_41; the topological closure of the scheme point formula_42 is the subscheme formula_43, including all the closed points of the subvariety, i.e. formula_44 with formula_45, or equivalently formula_46. 

The scheme formula_1 has a basis of open subsets given by the complements of hypersurfaces, formula_48 for irreducible polynomials formula_49. This set is endowed with its coordinate ring of regular functions formula_50. This induces a unique sheaf formula_15 which gives the usual ring of rational functions regular on a given open set formula_4. 

Each ring element formula_53, a polynomial function on formula_54, also defines a function on the points of the scheme formula_1 whose value at formula_42 lies in the quotient ring formula_57, the &quot;residue ring&quot;. We define formula_58 as the image of formula_59 under the natural map formula_60. A maximal ideal formula_44 gives the &quot;residue field&quot; formula_62, with the natural isomorphism formula_63, so that formula_64 corresponds to the original value formula_65. 

The vanishing locus of a polynomial formula_66 is a hypersurface subvariety formula_67, corresponding to the principal ideal formula_68. The corresponding scheme is formula_69, a closed subscheme of affine space. For example, taking formula_70 to be the complex or real numbers, the equation formula_71 defines a nodal cubic curve in the affine plane formula_72, corresponding to the scheme formula_73.

=== Spec of the integers ===
The ring of integers formula_74 can be considered as the coordinate ring of the scheme formula_75. The Zariski topology has closed points formula_76, the principal ideals of the prime numbers formula_77; as well as the generic point formula_78, the zero ideal, whose closure is the whole scheme. Closed sets are finite sets, and open sets are their complements, the cofinite sets; any infinite set of points is dense.

The basis open set corresponding to the irreducible element formula_79 is formula_80, with coordinate ring formula_81. For the open set formula_82, this induces formula_83.

A number formula_84 corresponds to a function on the scheme formula_85, a function whose value at formula_86 lies in the residue field formula_87, the finite field of integers modulo formula_88&quot;:&quot; the function is defined by formula_89, and also formula_90 in the generic residue ring formula_91. The function formula_20 is determined by its values at the points formula_86 only, so we can think of formula_20 as a kind of &quot;regular function&quot; on the closed points, a very special type among the arbitrary functions formula_95 with formula_96. 

Note that the point formula_86 is the vanishing locus of the function formula_98, the point where the value of formula_88 is equal to zero in the residue field. The field of &quot;rational functions&quot; on formula_85 is the fraction field of the generic residue ring, formula_101. A fraction formula_102 has &quot;poles&quot; at the points formula_86 corresponding to prime divisors of the denominator. 

This also gives a geometric interpretaton of Bezout&#x27;s lemma stating that if the integers formula_104 have no common prime factor, then there are integers formula_105 with formula_106. Geometrically, this is a version of the weak Hilbert Nullstellensatz for the scheme formula_85: if the functions formula_104 have no common vanishing points formula_86 in formula_85, then they generate the unit ideal formula_111 in the coordinate ring formula_112. Indeed, we may consider the terms formula_113 as forming a kind of partition of unity subordinate to the covering of formula_85 by the open sets formula_115. 

=== Affine line over the integers ===
The affine space formula_116 is a variety with coordinate ring formula_117, the polynomials with integer coefficients. The corresponding scheme is formula_118, whose points are all of the prime ideals formula_119. The closed points are maximal ideals of the form formula_120, where formula_88 is a prime number, and formula_122 is a non-constant polynomial with no integer factor and which is irreducible modulo formula_88. Thus, we may picture formula_124 as two-dimensional, with a &quot;characteristic direction&quot; measured by the coordinate formula_88, and a &quot;spatial direction&quot; with coordinate formula_126.

A given prime number formula_127 defines a &quot;vertical line&quot;, the subscheme formula_128 of the prime ideal formula_129: this contains formula_120 for all formula_131, the &quot;characteristic formula_127 points&quot; of the scheme. Fixing the formula_133-coordinate, we have the &quot;horizontal line&quot; formula_134, the subscheme formula_135 of the prime ideal formula_136. We also have the line formula_137 corresponding to the rational coordinate formula_138, which does not intersect formula_128 for those formula_127 which divide formula_141. 

A higher degree &quot;horizontal&quot; subscheme like formula_142 corresponds to formula_133-values which are roots of formula_144, namely formula_145. This behaves differently under different formula_127-coordinates. At formula_147, we get two points formula_148, since formula_149. At formula_150, we get one ramified double-point formula_151, since formula_152. And at formula_153, we get that formula_154 is a prime ideal corresponding to formula_145 in an extension field of formula_156; since we cannot distinguish between these values (they are symmetric under the Galois group), we should picture formula_157 as two fused points. Overall, formula_142 is a kind of fusion of two Galois-symmetric horizonal lines, a curve of degree 2. 

The residue field at formula_120 is formula_160, a field extension of formula_161 adjoining a root formula_162 of formula_122; this is a finite field with formula_164elements, formula_165. A polynomial formula_166 corresponds to a function on the scheme formula_167 with values formula_168, that is formula_169. Again each formula_166 is determined by its values formula_171 at closed points; formula_128 is the vanishing locus of the constant polynomial formula_173; and formula_174 contains the points in each characteristic formula_127 corresponding to Galois orbits of roots of formula_131 in the algebraic closure formula_177.

The scheme formula_167 is not proper, so that pairs of curves may fail to intersect with the expected multiplicity. This is a major obstacle to analyzing Diophantine equations with geometric tools. Arakelov theory overcomes this obstacle by compactifying affine arithmetic schemes, adding points at infinity corresponding to valuations. 

=== Arithmetic surfaces ===
If we consider a polynomial formula_179 then the affine scheme formula_180 has a canonical morphism to formula_181 and is called an arithmetic surface. The fibers formula_182 are then algebraic curves over the finite fields formula_183. If formula_184 is an elliptic curve, then the fibers over its discriminant locus, where formula_185are all singular schemes. For example, if formula_186 is a prime number and formula_187 then its discriminant is formula_188. This curve is singular over the prime numbers formula_189.

=== Non-affine schemes ===
* For any commutative ring &quot;R&quot; and natural number &quot;n&quot;, projective space formula_190 can be constructed as a scheme by gluing &quot;n&quot; + 1 copies of affine &quot;n&quot;-space over &quot;R&quot; along open subsets. This is the fundamental example that motivates going beyond affine schemes. The key advantage of projective space over affine space is that formula_190 is proper over &quot;R&quot;; this is an algebro-geometric version of compactness. Indeed, complex projective space formula_192 is a compact space in the classical topology, whereas formula_193 is not.
* A homogeneous polynomial &quot;f&quot; of positive degree in the polynomial ring determines a closed subscheme in projective space formula_190, called a projective hypersurface. In terms of the Proj construction, this subscheme can be written as formula_195 For example, the closed subscheme of formula_196 is an elliptic curve over the rational numbers.
* The line with two origins (over a field &quot;k&quot;) is the scheme defined by starting with two copies of the affine line over &quot;k&quot;, and gluing together the two open subsets A1 − 0 by the identity map. This is a simple example of a non-separated scheme. In particular, it is not affine.
* A simple reason to go beyond affine schemes is that an open subset of an affine scheme need not be affine. For example, let formula_197, say over the complex numbers formula_198; then &quot;X&quot; is not affine for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 2. (However, the affine line minus the origin is isomorphic to the affine scheme formula_199. To show &quot;X&quot; is not affine, one computes that every regular function on &quot;X&quot; extends to a regular function on formula_30 when &quot;n&quot; ≥ 2: this is analogous to Hartogs&#x27;s lemma in complex analysis, though easier to prove. That is, the inclusion formula_201 induces an isomorphism from formula_202 to formula_203. If &quot;X&quot; were affine, it would follow that &quot;f&quot; is an isomorphism, but &quot;f&quot; is not surjective and hence not an isomorphism. Therefore, the scheme &quot;X&quot; is not affine.
* Let &quot;k&quot; be a field. Then the scheme formula_204 is an affine scheme whose underlying topological space is the Stone–Čech compactification of the positive integers (with the discrete topology). In fact, the prime ideals of this ring are in one-to-one correspondence with the ultrafilters on the positive integers, with the ideal formula_205 corresponding to the principal ultrafilter associated to the positive integer &quot;n&quot;. This topological space is zero-dimensional, and in particular, each point is an irreducible component. Since affine schemes are quasi-compact, this is an example of a non-Noetherian quasi-compact scheme with infinitely many irreducible components. (By contrast, a Noetherian scheme has only finitely many irreducible components.)

=== Examples of morphisms ===

It is also fruitful to consider examples of morphisms as examples of schemes since they demonstrate their technical effectiveness for encapsulating many objects of study in algebraic and arithmetic geometry.

==Motivation for schemes==
Here are some of the ways in which schemes go beyond older notions of algebraic varieties, and their significance.

*Field extensions. Given some polynomial equations in &quot;n&quot; variables over a field &quot;k&quot;, one can study the set &quot;X&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) of solutions of the equations in the product set &quot;k&quot;&quot;n&quot;. If the field &quot;k&quot; is algebraically closed (for example the complex numbers), then one can base algebraic geometry on sets such as &quot;X&quot;(&quot;k&quot;): define the Zariski topology on &quot;X&quot;(&quot;k&quot;), consider polynomial mappings between different sets of this type, and so on. But if &quot;k&quot; is not algebraically closed, then the set &quot;X&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) is not rich enough. Indeed, one can study the solutions &quot;X&quot;(&quot;E&quot;) of the given equations in any field extension &quot;E&quot; of &quot;k&quot;, but these sets are not determined by &quot;X&quot;(&quot;k&quot;) in any reasonable sense. For example, the plane curve &quot;X&quot; over the real numbers defined by &quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;y&quot;2 = −1 has &quot;X&quot;(R) empty, but &quot;X&quot;(C) not empty. (In fact, &quot;X&quot;(C) can be identified with C − 0.) By contrast, a scheme &quot;X&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; has enough information to determine the set &quot;X&quot;(&quot;E&quot;) of &quot;E&quot;-rational points for every extension field &quot;E&quot; of &quot;k&quot;. (In particular, the closed subscheme of A defined by &quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;y&quot;2 = −1 is a nonempty topological space.)
*Generic point. The points of the affine line A, as a scheme, are its complex points (one for each complex number) together with one generic point (whose closure is the whole scheme). The generic point is the image of a natural morphism Spec(C(&quot;x&quot;)) → A, where C(&quot;x&quot;) is the field of rational functions in one variable. To see why it is useful to have an actual &quot;generic point&quot; in the scheme, consider the following example.
*Let &quot;X&quot; be the plane curve &quot;y&quot;2 = &quot;x&quot;(&quot;x&quot;−1)(&quot;x&quot;−5) over the complex numbers. This is a closed subscheme of A. It can be viewed as a ramified double cover of the affine line A by projecting to the &quot;x&quot;-coordinate. The fiber of the morphism &quot;X&quot; → A1 over the generic point of A1 is exactly the generic point of &quot;X&quot;, yielding the morphism formula_206 This in turn is equivalent to the degree-2 extension of fields formula_207 Thus, having an actual generic point of a variety yields a geometric relation between a degree-2 morphism of algebraic varieties and the corresponding degree-2 extension of function fields. This generalizes to a relation between the fundamental group (which classifies covering spaces in topology) and the Galois group (which classifies certain field extensions). Indeed, Grothendieck&#x27;s theory of the étale fundamental group treats the fundamental group and the Galois group on the same footing.

*Nilpotent elements. Let &quot;X&quot; be the closed subscheme of the affine line A defined by &quot;x&quot;2 = 0, sometimes called a fat point. The ring of regular functions on &quot;X&quot; is C[&quot;x&quot;]/(&quot;x&quot;2); in particular, the regular function &quot;x&quot; on &quot;X&quot; is nilpotent but not zero. To indicate the meaning of this scheme: two regular functions on the affine line have the same restriction to &quot;X&quot; if and only if they have the same value &quot;and first derivative&quot; at the origin. Allowing such non-reduced schemes brings the ideas of calculus and infinitesimals into algebraic geometry.
*Nilpotent elements arise naturally in intersection theory. For example in the plane formula_72 over a field formula_8, with coordinate ring formula_210, consider the &quot;x-&quot;axis, which is the variety formula_211, and the parabola formula_212, which is formula_213. Their scheme-theoretic intersection is defined by the ideal formula_214. Since the intersection is not transverse, this is not merely the point formula_215 defined by the ideal formula_216, but rather a fat point containing the &quot;x-&quot;axis tangent direction (the common tangent of the two curves) and having coordinate ring:formula_217The intersection multiplicity of 2 is defined as the length of this formula_210-module, i.e. its dimension as a formula_8-vector space.
*For a more elaborate example, one can describe all the zero-dimensional closed subschemes of degree 2 in a smooth complex variety &quot;Y&quot;. Such a subscheme consists of either two distinct complex points of &quot;Y&quot;, or else a subscheme isomorphic to &quot;X&quot; = Spec C[&quot;x&quot;]/(&quot;x&quot;2) as in the previous paragraph. Subschemes of the latter type are determined by a complex point &quot;y&quot; of &quot;Y&quot; together with a line in the tangent space T&quot;y&quot;&quot;Y&quot;. This again indicates that non-reduced subschemes have geometric meaning, related to derivatives and tangent vectors.

==Coherent sheaves==

A central part of scheme theory is the notion of coherent sheaves, generalizing the notion of (algebraic) vector bundles. For a scheme &quot;X&quot;, one starts by considering the abelian category of &quot;O&quot;&quot;X&quot;-modules, which are sheaves of abelian groups on &quot;X&quot; that form a module over the sheaf of regular functions &quot;O&quot;&quot;X&quot;. In particular, a module &quot;M&quot; over a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; determines an associated &quot;O&quot;&quot;X&quot;-module on &quot;X&quot; = Spec(&quot;R&quot;). A quasi-coherent sheaf on a scheme &quot;X&quot; means an &quot;O&quot;&quot;X&quot;-module that is the sheaf associated to a module on each affine open subset of &quot;X&quot;. Finally, a coherent sheaf (on a Noetherian scheme &quot;X&quot;, say) is an &quot;O&quot;&quot;X&quot;-module that is the sheaf associated to a finitely generated module on each affine open subset of &quot;X&quot;.

Coherent sheaves include the important class of vector bundles, which are the sheaves that locally come from finitely generated free modules. An example is the tangent bundle of a smooth variety over a field. However, coherent sheaves are richer; for example, a vector bundle on a closed subscheme &quot;Y&quot; of &quot;X&quot; can be viewed as a coherent sheaf on &quot;X&quot; that is zero outside &quot;Y&quot; (by the direct image construction). In this way, coherent sheaves on a scheme &quot;X&quot; include information about all closed subschemes of &quot;X&quot;. Moreover, sheaf cohomology has good properties for coherent (and quasi-coherent) sheaves. The resulting theory of coherent sheaf cohomology is perhaps the main technical tool in algebraic geometry.

==Generalizations==
Considered as its functor of points, a scheme is a functor that is a sheaf of sets for the Zariski topology on the category of commutative rings, and that, locally in the Zariski topology, is an affine scheme. This can be generalized in several ways. One is to use the étale topology. Michael Artin defined an algebraic space as a functor that is a sheaf in the étale topology and that, locally in the étale topology, is an affine scheme. Equivalently, an algebraic space is the quotient of a scheme by an étale equivalence relation. A powerful result, the Artin representability theorem, gives simple conditions for a functor to be represented by an algebraic space.

A further generalization is the idea of a stack. Crudely speaking, algebraic stacks generalize algebraic spaces by having an algebraic group attached to each point, which is viewed as the automorphism group of that point. For example, any action of an algebraic group &quot;G&quot; on an algebraic variety &quot;X&quot; determines a quotient stack [&quot;X&quot;/&quot;G&quot;], which remembers the stabilizer subgroups for the action of &quot;G&quot;. More generally, moduli spaces in algebraic geometry are often best viewed as stacks, thereby keeping track of the automorphism groups of the objects being classified.

Grothendieck originally introduced stacks as a tool for the theory of descent. In that formulation, stacks are (informally speaking) sheaves of categories. From this general notion, Artin defined the narrower class of algebraic stacks (or &quot;Artin stacks&quot;), which can be considered geometric objects. These include Deligne–Mumford stacks (similar to orbifolds in topology), for which the stabilizer groups are finite, and algebraic spaces, for which the stabilizer groups are trivial. The Keel–Mori theorem says that an algebraic stack with finite stabilizer groups has a coarse moduli space that is an algebraic space.

Another type of generalization is to enrich the structure sheaf, bringing algebraic geometry closer to homotopy theory. In this setting, known as derived algebraic geometry or &quot;spectral algebraic geometry&quot;, the structure sheaf is replaced by a homotopical analog of a sheaf of commutative rings (for example, a sheaf of E-infinity ring spectra). These sheaves admit algebraic operations that are associative and commutative only up to an equivalence relation. Taking the quotient by this equivalence relation yields the structure sheaf of an ordinary scheme. Not taking the quotient, however, leads to a theory that can remember higher information, in the same way that derived functors in homological algebra yield higher information about operations such as tensor product and the Hom functor on modules.
