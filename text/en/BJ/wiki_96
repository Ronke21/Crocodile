<text>In mathematics, the Grassmannian formula_1 (named in honour of Hermann Grassmann) is a differentiable manifold that parameterizes the set of all formula_2-dimensional linear subspaces of an formula_3-dimensional vector space formula_4 over a field formula_5 that has a differentiable structure. 
For example, the Grassmannian formula_6 is the space of lines through the origin in formula_4, so it is the same as the projective space formula_8 of one dimension lower than formula_4.
When formula_4 is a real or complex vector space, Grassmannians are compact smooth manifolds, of dimension formula_11. In general they have the structure of a nonsingular projective algebraic variety.

The earliest work on a non-trivial Grassmannian is due to Julius Plücker, who studied the set of projective lines in real projective 3-space, which is equivalent to formula_12, parameterizing them by what are now called Plücker coordinates. (See below.) Hermann Grassmann later introduced the concept in general.

Notations for Grassmannians vary between authors; they include formula_1, formula_14,formula_15, formula_16 to denote the Grassmannian of formula_2-dimensional subspaces of an formula_3-dimensional vector space formula_4.

==Motivation==
By giving a collection of subspaces of a vector space a topological structure, it is possible to talk about a continuous choice of subspaces or open and closed collections of subspaces. Giving them the further structure of a differentiable manifold, one can talk about smooth choices of subspace.

A natural example comes from tangent bundles of smooth manifolds embedded in a Euclidean space. Suppose we have a manifold formula_20 of dimension formula_2 embedded in formula_22. At each point formula_23, the tangent space to formula_20 can be considered as a subspace of the tangent space of formula_22, which is also just formula_22. The map assigning to formula_27 its tangent space defines a map from to formula_28. (In order to do this, we have to translate the tangent space at each formula_29 so that it passes through the origin rather than formula_30, and hence defines a formula_2-dimensional vector subspace. This idea is very similar to the Gauss map for surfaces in a 3-dimensional space.)

This can with some effort be extended to all vector bundles over a manifold formula_20, so that every vector bundle generates a continuous map from formula_20 to a suitably generalised Grassmannian—although various embedding theorems must be proved to show this. We then find that the properties of our vector bundles are related to the properties of the corresponding maps. In particular we find that vector bundles inducing homotopic maps to the Grassmannian are isomorphic. Here the definition of homotopy relies on a notion of continuity, and hence a topology.

==Low dimensions==
For , the Grassmannian is the space of lines through the origin in -space, so it is the same as the projective space formula_34of dimensions.

For , the Grassmannian is the space of all 2-dimensional planes containing the origin. In Euclidean 3-space, a plane containing the origin is completely characterized by the one and only line through the origin that is perpendicular to that plane (and vice versa); hence the spaces , , and (the projective plane) may all be identified with each other.

The simplest Grassmannian that is not a projective space is .

== The Grassmannian as a differentiable manifold ==

To endow formula_1 with the structure of a differentiable manifold, choose a basis for formula_4. This is equivalent to identifying formula_4 with formula_38, with the standard basis denoted formula_39, viewed as column vectors. Then for any formula_2-dimensional subspace formula_41, viewed as an element of formula_1, we may choose a basis consisting of formula_2 linearly independent column vectors formula_44. The homogeneous coordinates of the element formula_45 consist of the elements of the formula_46 maximal rank rectangular matrix formula_47 whose formula_48-th column vector is formula_49, formula_50. Since the choice of basis is arbitrary, two such maximal rank rectangular matrices formula_47 and formula_52 represent the same element formula_53 if and only if 
::formula_54 
for some element formula_55 of the general linear group of invertible formula_56 matrices with entries in formula_5. This defines an equivalence relation between formula_46 matrices formula_47 of rank formula_2, for which the equivalence classes are denoted formula_61.

We now define a coordinate atlas. For any formula_62 homogeneous coordinate matrix formula_47, we can apply elementary column operations (which amounts to multiplying formula_47 by a sequence of elements formula_55) to obtain its reduced column echelon form. If the first formula_2 rows of formula_47 are linearly independent, the result will have the form
::formula_68
and the formula_69 affine coordinate matrix
formula_70 with entries formula_71 determines formula_72. In general, the first formula_2 rows need not be independent, but since formula_47 has maximal rank formula_2, there exists an ordered set of integers formula_76 such that the formula_77 submatrix formula_78 whose rows are the formula_79-th rows of formula_47 is nonsingular. We may apply column operations to reduce this submatrix to the identity matrix, and the remaining entries uniquely determine formula_72. Hence we have the following definition:

For each ordered set of integers formula_76, let formula_83 be the set of elements formula_84 for which, for any choice of homogeneous coordinate matrix formula_47, the formula_86 submatrix formula_78 whose formula_88-th row is the formula_89-th row of formula_47 is nonsingular. The affine coordinate functions on formula_83 are then defined as the entries of the formula_92 matrix formula_93 whose rows are those of the matrix formula_94 complementary to formula_95, written in the same order. The choice of homogeneous formula_62 coordinate matrix formula_47 in formula_61 representing the element formula_84 does not affect the values of the affine coordinate matrix formula_93 representing on the coordinate neighbourhood formula_83. Moreover, the coordinate matrices formula_93 may take arbitrary values, and they define a diffeomorphism from formula_83 to the space of formula_5-valued formula_92 matrices.
Denote by

::formula_106

the homogeneous coordinate matrix having the identity matrix as the formula_77 submatrix with rows formula_108 and the affine coordinate matrix formula_93 in the consecutive complementary rows. On the overlap formula_110 between any two such coordinate neighborhoods, the affine coordinate matrix values formula_93 and formula_112 are related by the transition relations 
::formula_113

where both formula_78 and formula_115 are invertible. This may equivalently be written as
::formula_116
where formula_117
is the invertible formula_118 matrix whose formula_119th row is the formula_120th row of formula_121. The transition functions are therefore rational in the matrix elements of formula_122, and formula_123 gives an atlas for formula_1 as a differentiable manifold and also as an algebraic variety.

== The Grassmannian as a set of orthogonal projections ==
An alternative way to define a real or complex Grassmannian as a manifold is to view it as a set of orthogonal projection operators ( problem 5-C). For this, choose a positive definite real or Hermitian inner product formula_125 on formula_4, depending on whether formula_4 is real or complex. A formula_2-dimensional subspace formula_72 determines a unique orthogonal projection operator formula_130 whose image is formula_41 by splitting formula_4 into the orthogonal direct sum
::formula_133
of formula_72 and its orthogonal complement formula_135 and defining
::formula_136 
Conversely, every projection operator formula_137 of rank formula_2 defines a subspace formula_139 as its image. Since the rank of an orthogonal projection operator equals its trace, we can identify the Grassmann manifold formula_140 with the set of rank formula_2 orthogonal projection operators formula_137: 
::formula_143

In particular, taking formula_144 or formula_145 this gives completely explicit equations for embedding the Grassmannians formula_146, formula_147 in the space of real or complex formula_148 matrices formula_149, formula_150, respectively.

Since this defines the Grassmannian as a closed subset of the sphere formula_151 this is one way to see that the Grassmannian is a compact Hausdorff space. This construction also turns the Grassmannian formula_152 into a metric space with metric
::formula_153
for any pair formula_154 of formula_2-dimensional subspaces, where denotes the operator norm. The exact inner product used does not matter, because a different inner product will give an equivalent norm on formula_4, and hence an equivalent metric.

For the case of real or complex Grassmannians, the following is an equivalent way to express the above construction in terms of matrices.

== Grassmannians Gr(&quot;k&quot;,Rn) and Gr(&quot;k&quot;,Cn) as affine algebraic varieties ==
Let formula_157 denote the space of real formula_158 matrices and the subset formula_159 of matrices formula_160 that satisfy the three conditions:

* formula_137 is a projection operator: formula_162.
* formula_137 is symmetric: formula_164.
* formula_137 has trace formula_166.

There is a bijective correspondence between formula_167 and the Grassmannian formula_168 of formula_2-dimensional subspaces of formula_22 given by sending formula_171 to the formula_2-dimensional subspace of formula_22 spanned by its columns and, conversely, sending any element formula_174 to the projection matrix
::formula_175

where formula_176 is any orthonormal basis for formula_177, viewed as real formula_3 component column vectors.

An analogous construction applies to the complex Grassmannian formula_179, identifying it bijectively with the subset formula_180 of complex formula_158 matrices formula_182 satisfying
* formula_137 is a projection operator: formula_162.
* formula_137 is self-adjoint (Hermitian): formula_186.
* formula_137 has trace formula_166,
where the self-adjointness is with respect to the Hermitian inner product formula_189 in which the standard basis vectors formula_190 are orthonomal. The formula for the orthogonal projection matrix formula_191 onto the complex formula_2-dimensional subspace formula_193 spanned by the orthonormal (unitary) basis vectors formula_176 is
::formula_195

== The Grassmannian as a homogeneous space ==
The quickest way of giving the Grassmannian a geometric structure is to express it as a homogeneous space. First, recall that the general linear group formula_196 acts transitively on the formula_2-dimensional subspaces of formula_4. Therefore, if we choose a subspace formula_199 of dimension formula_2, any element formula_201
can be expressed as
:formula_202
for some group element formula_203,
where formula_204 is determined only up to right multiplication
by elements formula_205 of the stabilizer of formula_206:
:formula_207
under the formula_196-action.

We may therefore identify formula_152 with the quotient space
:formula_210
of left cosets of formula_211.

If the underlying field is formula_212 or formula_213 and formula_196 is considered as a Lie group, this construction makes the Grassmannian a smooth manifold under the quotient structure. More generally, over a ground field formula_5, the group formula_196 is an algebraic group, and this construction shows that the Grassmannian is a non-singular algebraic variety. It follows from the existence of the Plücker embedding that the Grassmannian is complete as an algebraic variety. In particular, formula_211 is a parabolic subgroup of formula_196.

Over formula_212 or formula_213 it also becomes possible to use smaller groups in this construction. To do this over formula_212, fix a Euclidean inner product formula_222 on formula_4. The real orthogonal group formula_224 acts transitively on the set of formula_2-dimensional subspaces formula_152 and the stabiliser of a formula_2-space formula_228 is 
:formula_229,
where formula_230 is the orthogonal complement of formula_206 in formula_4. 
This gives an identification as the homogeneous space
:formula_233.
If we take formula_144 and formula_235 (the first formula_2 components) we get the isomorphism
:formula_237

Over , if we choose an Hermitian inner product formula_238, the unitary group formula_239 acts transitively, and we find analogously
:formula_240
or, for formula_145 and formula_242,
:formula_243

In particular, this shows that the Grassmannian is compact, and of (real or complex) dimension .

== The Grassmannian as a scheme ==
In the realm of algebraic geometry, the Grassmannian can be constructed as a scheme by expressing it as a representable functor.

===Representable functor===
Let formula_244 be a quasi-coherent sheaf on a scheme formula_245. Fix a positive integer formula_2. Then to each formula_245-scheme formula_248, the Grassmannian functor associates the set of quotient modules of
:: formula_249
locally free of rank formula_2 on formula_248. We denote this set by formula_252.

This functor is representable by a separated formula_245-scheme formula_254. The latter is projective if formula_255 is finitely generated. When formula_245 is the spectrum of a field formula_5, then the sheaf formula_258 is given by a vector space formula_4 and we recover the usual Grassmannian variety of the dual space of formula_4, namely: formula_152.
By construction, the Grassmannian scheme is compatible with base changes: for any formula_245-scheme formula_263, we have a canonical isomorphism
::formula_264

In particular, for any point formula_265 of formula_245, the canonical morphism formula_267
induces an isomorphism from the fiber formula_268 to the usual Grassmannian formula_269 over the residue field formula_270.

===Universal family===
Since the Grassmannian scheme represents a functor, it comes with a universal object, formula_271, which is an object of
formula_272 and therefore a quotient module formula_271 of formula_274, locally free of rank formula_2 over formula_254. The quotient homomorphism induces a closed immersion from the projective bundle:
::formula_277

For any morphism of -schemes:
::formula_278
this closed immersion induces a closed immersion
::formula_279

Conversely, any such closed immersion comes from a surjective homomorphism of formula_280-modules from formula_281 to a locally free module of rank formula_2. Therefore, the elements of formula_283 are exactly the projective subbundles of rank formula_2 in formula_285

Under this identification, when formula_286 is the spectrum of a field formula_287 and formula_244 is given by a vector space formula_4, the set of rational points formula_290 correspond to the projective linear subspaces of dimension formula_291 in formula_8, and the image of formula_293 in
::formula_294
is the set
::formula_295

== The Plücker embedding ==

The Plücker embedding is a natural embedding of the Grassmannian formula_152 into the projectivization of the formula_2th Exterior power formula_298 of formula_4.
::formula_300

Suppose that formula_41 is a formula_2-dimensional subspace of the formula_3-dimensional vector space formula_4. To define formula_305, choose a basis formula_306 for formula_72, and let formula_305 be the projectivization of the wedge product of these basis elements:
formula_309
where formula_310 denotes the projective equivalence class.

A different basis for formula_72 will give a different wedge product, but the two will differ only by a non-zero scalar multiple (the determinant of the change of basis matrix). Since the right-hand side takes values in the projectivized space, formula_312 is well-defined. To see that it is an embedding, notice that it is possible to recover formula_72 from formula_305 as the span of the set of all vectors formula_315 such that 
::formula_316.

=== Plücker coordinates and Plücker relations ===
The Plücker embedding of the Grassmannian satisfies a set of simple quadratic relations called the Plücker relations. These show that the Grassmannian formula_1 embeds as a nonsingular projective algebraic subvariety of the projectivization formula_318 of the formula_2th exterior power of formula_4 and give another method for constructing the Grassmannian. To state the Plücker relations, fix a basis formula_321 for formula_4, and let formula_41 be a formula_2-dimensional subspace of formula_4 with basis formula_176. Let formula_327 be the components of formula_328 with respect to the chosen basis of formula_4, and formula_330 the formula_2-component column vectors forming the transpose of the corresponding homogeneous coordinate matrix: 
:: formula_332

For any ordered sequence formula_333 of formula_2 positive integers, let formula_335 be the determinant of the formula_77 matrix with columns formula_337. The elements formula_338 are called the Plücker coordinates of the element formula_53 of the Grassmannian (with respect to the basis formula_321 of formula_4). These are the linear coordinates of the image formula_305 of formula_72 under the Plücker map, relative to the basis of the exterior power formula_344 space generated by the basis formula_321 of formula_4. Since a change of basis for formula_72 gives rise to multiplication of the Plücker coordinates by a nonzero constant (the determinant of the change of basis matrix), these are only defined up to projective equivalence, and hence determine a point in formula_348.

For any two ordered sequences formula_349 and formula_350 of formula_291 and formula_352 positive integers, respectively, the following homogeneous quadratic equations, known as the Plücker relations, or the Plücker-Grassmann relations, are valid and determine the image formula_353 of formula_1 under the Plücker map embedding:
:: formula_355

where formula_356 denotes the sequence formula_357 with the term formula_120 omitted. These are consistent, determining a nonsingular projective algebraic variety, but they are not algebraically independent. They are equivalent to the statement that formula_305 is the projectivization of a completely decomposable element of formula_298.

When formula_361, and formula_362 (the simplest Grassmannian that is not a projective space), the above reduces to a single equation. Denoting the homogeneous coordinates of the image formula_363 under the Plücker map as formula_364, this single Plücker relation is
::formula_365

In general, many more equations are needed to define the image formula_353 of the Grassmannian in formula_348 under the Plücker embedding.

== Duality ==
Every formula_2-dimensional subspace formula_369 determines an formula_370-dimensional quotient space formula_371 of formula_4. This gives the natural short exact sequence:
::formula_373

Taking the dual to each of these three spaces and the dual linear transformations yields an inclusion of formula_374 in formula_375 with quotient formula_376
::formula_377

Using the natural isomorphism of a finite-dimensional vector space with its double dual shows that taking the dual again recovers the original short exact sequence. Consequently there is a one-to-one correspondence between formula_2-dimensional subspaces of formula_4 and formula_380-dimensional subspaces of formula_375. In terms of the Grassmannian, this gives a canonical isomorphism
::formula_382

that associates to each subspace formula_369 its annihilator formula_384.
Choosing an isomorphism of formula_4 with formula_375 therefore determines a (non-canonical) isomorphism between formula_387 and formula_388. An isomorphism of formula_4 with formula_375 is equivalent to the choice of an inner product, so with respect to the chosen inner product, this isomorphism of Grassmannians sends any formula_2-dimensional subspace into its formula_380}-dimensional orthogonal complement.

==Schubert cells==
The detailed study of Grassmannians makes use of a decomposition into affine subpaces called &quot;Schubert cells&quot;, which were first applied in enumerative geometry. The Schubert cells for formula_1 are defined in terms of a specified complete flag of subspaces formula_394 of dimension formula_395. For any integer partition 
: formula_396
of weight
::formula_397

consisting of weakly decreasing non-negative integers
:formula_398 
whose Young diagram fits within the rectangular one formula_399, the Schubert cell formula_400 consists of those elements formula_401 whose intersections with the subspaces formula_402 have the following dimensions
::formula_403

These are affine spaces, and their closures (within the Zariski topology) are known as Schubert varieties.

As an example of the technique, consider the problem of determining the Euler characteristic formula_404 of the Grassmannian formula_28 of -dimensional subspaces of . Fix a formula_406-dimensional subspace formula_407 and consider the partition of formula_28 into those -dimensional subspaces of that contain and those that do not. The former is formula_409 and the latter is a rank formula_2 vector bundle over formula_411. This gives recursive formulae:
::formula_412

Solving these recursion relations gives the formula: formula_413 if formula_3 is even and formula_2 is odd and
::formula_416
otherwise.

===Cohomology ring of the complex Grassmannian===
Every point in the complex Grassmann manifold formula_417 defines a formula_2-plane in formula_3-space. Mapping each point in a k-plane to the point representing that plane in the Grassmannian, one obtains the vector bundle formula_420 which generalizes the tautological bundle of a projective space. Similarly the formula_380-dimensional orthogonal complements of these planes yield an orthogonal vector bundle formula_422. The integral cohomology of the Grassmannians is generated, as a ring, by the Chern classes of formula_420. In particular, all of the integral cohomology is at even degree as in the case of a projective space.

These generators are subject to a set of relations, which defines the ring. The defining relations are easy to express for a larger set of generators, which consists of the Chern classes of formula_420 and formula_422. Then the relations merely state that the direct sum of the bundles formula_420 and formula_422 is trivial. Functoriality of the total Chern classes allows one to write this relation as
::formula_428

The quantum cohomology ring was calculated by Edward Witten. The generators are identical to those of the classical cohomology ring, but the top relation is changed to
::formula_429
reflecting the existence in the corresponding quantum field theory of an instanton with formula_430 fermionic zero-modes which violates the degree of the cohomology corresponding to a state by formula_430 units.

==Associated measure==
When formula_4 is an formula_3-dimensional Euclidean space, we may define a uniform measure on formula_1 in the following way. Let formula_435 be the unit Haar measure on the orthogonal group formula_436 and fix formula_84. Then for a set formula_438 , define
::formula_439

This measure is invariant under the action of the group formula_436; that is,
::formula_441
for all formula_442.
Since formula_443, we have 
formula_444. 
Moreover, formula_445 is a Radon measure with respect to the metric space topology and is uniform in the sense that every ball of the same radius (with respect to this metric) is of the same measure.

==Oriented Grassmannian==
This is the manifold consisting of all &quot;oriented&quot; formula_2-dimensional subspaces of formula_22. It is a double cover of formula_28 and is denoted by formula_449.

As a homogeneous space it can be expressed as:
:formula_450

==Orthogonal isotropic Grassmannians==
Given a real or complex nondegenerate symmetric bilinear form formula_451 on the formula_3-dimensional space formula_4 (i.e., a scalar product), the totally isotropic Grassmannian formula_454 is defined as the subvariety formula_455 consisting of all formula_2-dimensional subspaces formula_41 for which
:: formula_458

Maximal isotropic Grassmannians with respect to a real or complex scalar product are closely related to Cartan&#x27;s theory of spinors.
Under the Cartan embedding, their connected components are equivariantly diffeomorphic to the projectivized minimal spinor orbit, under the spin representation, the so-called projective pure spinor variety which, similarly to the image of the Plücker map embedding, is cut out as the intersection of a number of quadrics, the 
Cartan quadrics.

==Applications==

A key application of Grassmannians is as the &quot;universal&quot; embedding space for bundles with connections on compact manifolds.

Another important application is Schubert calculus, which is the enumerative geometry involved in calculating the number of points, lines, planes, etc. in a projective space that intersect a given set of points, lines, etc., using the intersection theory of Schubert varieties. Subvarieties of Schubert cells can also be used to parametrize simultaneous eigenvectors of complete sets of commuting operators in quantum integrable spin systems, such as the Gaudin model, using the Bethe ansatz method.

A further application is to the solution of hierarchies of classical completely integrable systems of partial differential equations, such as the Kadomtsev–Petviashvili equation and the associated KP hierarchy. These can be expressed in terms of abelian group flows on an infinite-dimensional Grassmann manifold. The KP equations, expressed in Hirota bilinear form in terms of the KP Tau function are equivalent to the Plücker relations.
A similar construction holds for solutions of the BKP integrable hierarchy, in terms of abelian group flows on an infinite dimensional maximal isotropic Grassmann manifold.

Finite dimensional positive Grassmann manifolds can be used to express soliton solutions of KP equations which are nonsingular for real values of the KP flow parameters.

The scattering amplitudes of subatomic particles in maximally supersymmetric super Yang-Mills theory may be calculated in the planar limit via a positive Grassmannian construct called the amplituhedron.

Grassmann manifolds have also found applications in computer vision tasks of video-based face recognition and shape recognition, and are used in the data-visualization technique known as the grand tour.

<text>Joseph Alphonse Adhémar (1797–1862) was a French mathematician. He was the first to suggest that ice ages were controlled by astronomical forces in his 1842 book &quot;Revolutions of the Sea&quot;.

The Earth&#x27;s orbit is elliptical, with the Sun at one focus; lines drawn through the summer and winter solstice; and the spring and autumn equinox; intersect with the Sun at right angles. The Earth is closest to the Sun (perihelion) near the northern hemisphere winter solstice. The Earth moves faster through its orbit when closer to the Sun. Hence, the period from the northern hemisphere&#x27;s autumn equinox to winter and spring is shorter by around seven days than the period from spring to summer to autumn; the reverse is true in the southern hemisphere. Hence, northern hemisphere winter is shorter.

Because of this, Adhemar reasoned that because the southern hemisphere had more hours of darkness in winter, it must be cooling, and attributed the Antarctic ice sheet to this. Adhemar knew of the 22,000 year cycle of precession of the equinoxes, and theorised that the ice ages occurred in this cycle.

One immediate objection to the theory was that the total insolation during a year does not vary at all during the precessional cycle, only its seasonal distribution. Another was that the timing was wrong; however this could not be tested by observations available at the time.

Adhemar&#x27;s theory was further developed, first by James Croll and later by Milutin Milanković.

Adhemar predicted the Antarctic ice sheet and theorised about its thickness by comparing the depths of the Arctic and circum-Antarctic oceans. Finding the Antarctic oceans deeper (the measurements he used may not have been fully representative) and attributing this to the gravitational attraction of the Antarctic ice sheet, he postulated a truly enormous ice sheet approximately 90 km thick.

<text>A property tax (whose rate is expressed as a percentage or per mille, also called &quot;millage&quot;) is an ad valorem tax on the value of a property.

The tax is levied by the governing authority of the jurisdiction in which the property is located. This can be a national government, a federated state, a county or other geographical region, or a municipality. Multiple jurisdictions may tax the same property.

Often a property tax is levied on real estate. It may be imposed annually or at the time of a real estate transaction, such as in real estate transfer tax. This tax can be contrasted with a rent tax, which is based on rental income or imputed rent, and a land value tax, which is a levy on the value of land, excluding the value of buildings and other improvements.

Under a property tax system, the government requires or performs an appraisal of the monetary value of each property, and tax is assessed in proportion to that value.

== Type ==
The four broad types of property taxes are land, improvements to land (immovable man-made objects, such as buildings), personal property (movable man-made objects) and intangible property. Real property (also called real estate or realty) is the combination of land and improvements.

Forms of property tax vary across jurisdictions. Real property is often taxed based on its class. Classification is the grouping of properties based on similar use. Properties in different classes are taxed at different rates. Examples of property classes are residential, commercial, industrial and vacant real property. In Israel, for example, property tax rates are double for vacant apartments versus occupied apartments. France has a tax on vacant properties, which successfully reduced the vacancy rate.

A special assessment tax is sometimes confused with property tax. These are two distinct forms of taxation: one (&quot;ad valorem tax&quot;) relies upon the fair market value of the property. The other (special assessment) relies upon a special enhancement called a &quot;benefit&quot; for its justification.

The &quot;property tax rate&quot; is typically given as a percentage. It may be expressed as a per mil (amount of tax per thousand currency units of property value), which is also known as a &quot;millage rate&quot; or &quot;mill&quot; (one-thousandth of a currency unit). To calculate the property tax, the authority multiplies the assessed value by the mill rate and then divides by 1,000. For example, a property with an assessed value of located in a municipality with a mill rate of 20 mills would have a property tax bill of per year.

==By jurisdiction==

Property classes, tax rates, assessment rules and valuations vary by jurisdiction.

===Armenia===

Comparatively, Armenia ranks low internationally in terms of property tax to GDP ratio. Currently, it is 0.2% compared to the 2% global average. Based on the new amendments in the tax code, from 2021 property taxes are calculated based on market value prices, separately for apartments and residential houses. The new amendment removed the previously existing non-taxable property threshold, putting a minimum of 0.05% property tax.

Real Estate Tax Rate on Residential Houses and Country Houses:
* Up to 7 mln AMD inclusive – 0.05%
* 7–23 mln AMD inclusive – 3.500 AMD + 0.1% of tax base amount exceeding 7 mln AMD
* 23–50 mln AMD inclusive – 19.500 AMD + 0.2% of tax base amount exceeding 23 mln AMD
* 50–85 mln AMD inclusive – 73.500 AMD + 0.4% of tax base amount exceeding 50 mln AMD
* 85–120 mln AMD inclusive – 213.500 AMD + 0.6% of tax base amount exceeding 85 mln AMD
* 120–200 mln AMD inclusive – 423.500 AMD + 1% of tax base amount exceeding 120 mln AMD
* More than 200 mln AMD – 1.223.500 AMD + 1.5% of tax base amount exceeding 200 mln AMD

Real Estate Tax Rate on Apartment building, Apartments and Non-Residential Areas:
* Up to 10 mln AMD inclusive – 0.05%
* 10–25 mln AMD inclusive – 5.000 AMD + 0.1% of tax base amount exceeding 10 mln AMD
* 25–47 mln AMD inclusive – 20.000 AMD + 0.2% of tax base amount exceeding 25 mln AMD
* 47–75 mln AMD inclusive – 64.000 AMD + 0.4% of tax base amount exceeding 47 mln AMD
* 75–100 mln AMD inclusive – 176.000 AMD + 0.6% of tax base amount exceeding 75 mln AMD
* 100–200 mln AMD inclusive – 326.000 AMD + 1% of tax base amount exceeding 100 mln AMD
* More than 200 mln AMD – 1.326.000 AMD + 1.5% of tax base amount exceeding 200 mln AMD

===Australia===
Australian property is taxed at both the state and council (local municipal) level. Taxes are payable by property owners – there is no property tax charged to renters.

A state tax commonly called &quot;stamp duty&quot; is assessed when property is purchased or transferred. It is typically around 5% of the purchase price, payable by the purchaser. Other transfer charges may also apply, including special fees for investors from overseas.

&quot;Land tax&quot; – also a state tax – is assessed every year on a property&#x27;s value. Most Australians do not pay land tax, as most states provide a land tax exemption for the primary home or residence. Depending on the state, surcharge tax rates can apply to foreign owners.

&quot;Council rates&quot; is a municipal tax levied by local government. This is assessed each year on a property&#x27;s value. Council rates are around $1300 per annum for an average Australian household.

===Brazil===
Brazil is a Federation Republic, and its federated entities (internal States and Municipalities), as well as the Federal government, levy property taxes. They are all declared in the Federal Constitution.

These are the current property taxes:
* Tax on Rural Territorial Property (&quot;Imposto Territorial Rural - ITR&quot;) – federal: levied upon real state property on rural areas;
* Tax on Urban Territorial Property (&quot;Imposto Predial e Territorial Urbano - IPTU&quot;) – municipal: levied upon real state property on urban areas;
* Tax on Motorized Vehicles Property (&quot;Imposto sobre Propriedades de Veículos Automotores - IPVA&quot;) – state: levied upon the property of cars, trucks, motorcycles, and the likes;
* Tax on Large Fortunes (&quot;Imposto sobre Grandes Fortunas&quot;) – federal: it is declared on the Federal Constitution, but there is still no regulation defining its incidence.

===Canada===

Many provinces levy property tax on real estate based upon land use and value. This is the major source of revenue for most municipal governments. While property tax levels vary across municipalities, a common property assessment or valuation criterion is laid out in provincial legislation. The trend is to use a market value standard for valuation purposes with varying revaluation cycles. Multiple provinces established an annual reassessment cycle where market activity warrants, while others have longer periods between valuation periods. There are two types of property tax: annual property tax and land transfer tax.

==== Annual property taxes ====
The annual property tax is usually a percentage of the taxable assessed value of the property. The taxable assessed value is commonly determined by the assessment service provider of the municipality. The annual property tax rate for any province contains at least two elements: the municipal rate and the education rate. The combination of municipal and education tax portions along with any base taxes or other special taxes determines the full amount of the tax.

* In Ontario, property tax was first introduced in 1849 with the Municipal Act (or Baldwin Act) as the act constituted a municipal structure with cities, towns, and villages along with the creation of property tax that municipalities must collect that would also support schools. The tax is calculated by multiplying the current year property-value assessed by the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation (MPAC) with the total tax rate. A study from 2019 suggested that Toronto, the capital of Ontario, had the lowest property tax in the province at that time.
* In British Columbia, the BC Assessment conducts an evaluation of properties all over British Columbia and submits assessed values for each of them yearly. BC Assessment maintains real property assessments in compliance with the Assessment Act which requires that properties be assessed as of 1 July each year. The final property tax amount is calculated by multiplying the municipal final property tax rate for the year by the BC Assessment value. Vancouver has the lowest property tax in Canada as a percentage of assessed value because while property values are extremely high, the city&#x27;s budget has stayed relatively constant.
* In Alberta, property taxes have existed since 1905, when Alberta became a Province; up until 1995, all properties and land except for farmland including industrial and residential properties were assessed at market value but the adoption of the Municipal Government Act in 1995 brought along many changes to property assessments. Properties in Alberta are assessed currently every year by municipalities according to guidelines by the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and the Alberta Assessment and Property Tax Policy Unit. Property taxes in Alberta are primarily made up of two components: a municipal tax and a provincial education tax. The specific property tax rate for a certain year depends on the budget of the municipality and its total assessment base, and Education property tax rates are also set by municipalities.
* In Saskatchewan, properties are assessed by the assessment service provider of the municipality which is usually the Saskatchewan Assessment Management Agency (SAMA). A taxable rate established by the province will be applied to the full value which determines the taxable assessment. For the municipal portion of the tax, the municipal mill rate (1 mill = 0.001) will be multiplied by the total taxable assessment then multiplied by the mill rate factor for determining the amount. There is a set education mill rate established by the province for all municipalities, and no mill rate factor is applied to it. The combination of municipal and education tax portions along with any base taxes or other special taxes determines the full amount of the tax.
* In Manitoba, property value assessments are conducted by the provincial assessment services delivered through 10 district offices with the exception of Winnipeg, which has their assessment conducted by the City of Winnipeg only. Each class of property will have a different sized portion of their assessed value that is taxable. The property tax in Manitoba is made out of four parts: a municipal rate, a provincial Education rate, a School Division rate, and additional taxes for local services as needed. Every year, the education tax is set by the provincial Minister of Education while the rest is set by the City Council; the rates are expressed in mills.
* In Québec, value assessments are conducted by the respective regional county municipality (municipalité régionale de comté) every three years. Regional county municipalities were established in 1979 to deal primarily with land use. In Québec property tax is usually based on the assessed value of a property and the residential property tax rate. Properties are assessed using a market value-based approach. For residential properties, the sales of similar properties are compared to determine a valuation for the property. In unique circumstances, a cost approach is used where the cost of the property, if someone were to rebuild it, is given a valuation minus depreciation. For properties that are intended for generating income, an income approach is used to assess the market value. In this province, property taxes are used to pay for services such as the fire and police department, public transportation, as well as elementary and secondary education.

====Land transfer tax====
Land transfer tax is a provincial tax levied when purchasing a home or land in Canada. All provinces have a land transfer tax, except Alberta and Saskatchewan. In most provinces, the tax is calculated as a percentage of the purchase price. In Toronto there is an additional municipal tax.

Ontario, British Columbia, Prince Edward Island, Montreal, and the City of Toronto offer land transfer tax rebates for first-time homebuyers.

=====British Columbia=====
In British Columbia the property transfer tax is equal to one percent tax on the first of the purchase price, two percent on the remaining amount up to and three percent on the rest. An additional 15% tax that applies only to non-resident foreign home buyers in Greater Vancouver started on 2 August 2016. Later in 2018 this was raised to 20%. The definition of foreign buyer includes international students and temporary foreign workers. Anti-avoidance measures include fines of $100,000 for individuals and $200,000 for corporations.

======First time home buyers program======
The First Time Home Buyers Program is a program by the BC government that offers qualifying first-time homebuyers a reduction or elimination of the property transfer tax. It can be used in conjunction with the B.C. Home Owner Mortgage and Equity Partnership.

The First Time Home Buyers Tax Credit is also available in Ontario, which offers First Time Home Buyers a 750 dollar tax Rebate. In 2017 the Ontario Government also released the Land Transfer Tax Rebate, which allowed for up to 4,000 dollar rebate – ensuring that first time home buyers of homes valued under 368,000 dollars would not pay land transfer tax.

====== New home exemption ======
The Newly Built Home Exemption is a program that reduces or eliminates the property transfer tax on new homes. The amount is limited to for qualifying individuals who must be either a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident. The property purchased must be located in British Columbia, have a fair market value of , be smaller than and be used as a principle residence. It can be used in conjunction with the B.C. Home Owner Mortgage and Equity Partnership.

===Chile===
The land property tax, called &quot;territorial tax&quot; or &quot;contribution&quot;, is an annual amount paid quarterly by the property&#x27;s owner. It is determined as a percentage of the property&#x27;s &quot;fiscal value&quot;, which is calculated by the Internal Revenue Service, based on the property&#x27;s land and built area, construction materials, age, and use. The fiscal value, which is usually much lower than the market value, may be disputed by the owner. The annual levy varies between 1 and 2% of this value, depending on the property&#x27;s use (residential, agricultural or commercial). Residential properties valued below (as of 2013) are not taxed; those above that threshold are taxed only on the amount exceeding . Revenues go to the municipality administering the property&#x27;s commune. All municipalities contribute a share of the revenue to a &quot;common municipal fund&quot; that is then redistributed back to municipalities according to a their needs (commune&#x27;s poverty rate, etc.). Additionally, municipalities charge a quarterly trash collection tax, which is often paid together with the territorial tax (if applicable).

=== Egypt ===
The law imposes a tax on each property. Public buildings are excluded (such as government buildings), as are religious buildings (mosques and churches). Families owning private properties worth up to £E2 million ($41,700) are exempt. Commercial stores with an annual rent value over £E1,200 are not exempt.

===France===

In France, the property tax (taxe foncière) is a local tax payable by all owners of real estate located in France. This tax is used to finance the budget of local authorities.
The property tax comprises three different taxes: the tax on built properties, the tax on unbuilt properties, and a tax on household waste removal.

Property tax on built properties

This is the most common tax in France. It is detailed in Article 1380 of the General Tax Code. Since it is a local tax, the property tax of built properties has a census role. The tax authorities count the new owners every year.
Two conditions must be met to be subject to this tax: The property must be irremovable and must fall into the category of real buildings.

This tax therefore applies to the following goods:

* Installations intended to shelter people: house, apartment, loft, chalet, villa, etc.
* Parkings
* Industrial or commercial installations: hangar, workshop, premises etc.
* Work of art
* Telecommunications channels
* Boats used at a fixed point
* Soils of all types of buildings and land forming an essential and immediate dependency of these constructions

Property tax on non-built properties

This tax concerns land that is not used for residential purposes.

It applies to the following goods:

* Land and greenhouses assigned to an agricultural operation
* Bodies of water, marshes and salt marshes
* Quarries, mines and peatlands
* Soils of built properties, rural buildings, courtyards and outbuildings
* Golf courses, without constructions, commercially operated or not
* Private roads, gardens and parks, etc.
* Land occupied by railways

Responsible for property tax

The owner, not tenant, of the property must pay the tax. The owner liable for property tax can be an individual, company or legal entity (commercial company or real estate company). The tax is due each year from taxpayers who own property on 1 January of the tax year. If the property is sold during the year, the seller can ask for the tax to be shared with the buyer.

Specific situations:

* In the case of a dismemberment of the property right, it is the usufructuary who is liable for the property tax.
* In the event of joint ownership, the property tax is established in the name of all joint owners
* If a condominium real estate company is liable for property tax, then the taxation is established in the name of each partner in proportion to their share.

Calculation of property tax and payment

The calculation of the property tax is based on three components:

* The cadastral rental value: This value corresponds to the theoretical amount that could be applied if the property was rented.
* The revaluation coefficient: This coefficient is voted each year by the government.
* The tax rate voted by the local authorities: This rate is voted each year by the municipalities.

The amount of property tax is equal to the tax base x the tax rate voted by the municipality.

The tax base is equal to 50% of the cadastral rental value of the property (For non-built properties, this tax base is equal to 80%). To this base is then applied the revaluation coefficient. (It stood at 1.012 for 2020).

The payment of the property tax is usually made before mid-October. The tax notice is drawn up in the name of the owner who is the only person liable for the property tax. The precise deadline for paying it varies depending on the method of payment chosen.

Exemption from property tax

In certain situations the property tax allows exemptions. The conditions of this exemption may depend on the property or the situation of the owner.

* New housing is subject to a 2-year temporary exemption.
* New constructions occupied by low-rent housing are subject to a 15-year temporary exemption.
* Old dwellings that have undergone energy renovation work are subject to a 5-year temporary exemption.
* Owners over the age of 75 whose reference tax income is capped are exempt for life. (For 2019, the reference tax income must not exceed 11,098 euros for the first part of the family quotient)

Certain properties are permanently exempt:

* The properties of the State and of the various public authorities
* Public works established for the distribution of drinking water
* State-owned buildings used for worship
* Fixed assets intended for the production of electricity from photovoltaic sources

There are also exemptions for unbuilt properties.&lt;br&gt;
For example, land sown, planted or replanted with wood can be 100% exempt for a period ranging from 10 to 50 years depending on the plantations.

In 1999, France introduced a tax on vacant properties. It reduced the vacancy rate by 13%.

Taxes on Secondary Residences and Unoccupied Dwellings

In addition to ordinary property tax, other related taxes may be paid on secondary residences or unoccupied dwellings.

The &quot;taxe d&#x27;habitation sur les résidences secondaires&quot; is a local tax payable by the owner, usufructuary, or long-term lessee of a (furnished) secondary residence. This tax is based on the cadastral rental value of the property and its annexes, and the local tax rate; it may be subject to increased taxation if it is located in a government-designated &quot;zone tendue&quot; (an area where the housing market is deemed tight).

The &quot;taxe annuelle sur les logements vacants&quot; (TLV) and the &quot;taxe d&#x27;habitation sur les logements vacants&quot; (THLV) are taxes payable by the owner of an unfurnished, unoccupied dwelling. The TLV is paid annually to the central government if the dwelling is located in a &quot;zone tendue&quot; and has been left unoccupied for at least one year. The THLV is payable to municipalities that have opted to implement the tax, and applies to dwellings left unoccupied for more than two years.

===Germany===
Real Property Tax

In Germany, the legal basis for the property tax is the so-called Grundsteuergesetz (GrStG), that is the property tax law, according to which real property is classified into the following two categories (§2 GrStG):

* Real property utilised for agriculture and forestry
* Constructible real property or real property with buildings.
The tax rate is dependent on the category the respective real property falls into. The tax burden is calculated by multiplying the value of the real property according to the official assessment code (Bewertungsgesetz) with the real property tax rate and with the applicable municipal multiplier. The real property property tax rate is set by the Federal state, in which the respective real property is located. It ranges from 0.26 to 1 percent. The municipal multiplier is set by each municipality.

Real Property Tax Revenue

The revenue of property taxes amounts to almost 15 billion euros annually and benefits the municipalities for whom the property tax is among the most important sources of income. This is because the property tax revenues are utilised on a municipal level to finance public facilities such as schools, libraries, daycare centers and local infrastructure projects.

Real Property Tax Reform

In 2018, the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that the system of property tax assessment is unconstitutional since it treated similar properties differently and thus resulted in a violation of Article 3 (equality before the law) of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany. So far, the calculation of property tax has been based on decades-old standard values. In the federal states of the former West Germany these standard values were last established in 1964, whereas the standard values of the former East Germany were last determined in 1935. Accordingly, these standard values do not reflect the development of the real properties´ market values. Therefore, the Federal Constitutional Court declared that the standard values lead to unequal tax treatment. Consequently, the German parliament had to enact a property tax reform, which entered into force in 2022. As a result, all property owners were obliged to submit a reassessment of their property values as of 1 January 2022 to the fiscal authorities by 31 January 2023. Property taxes calculated in accordance with these new values will be levied from 1 January 2025 onwards. In addition, the real property tax reform grants municipalities the right to set an increased rate of assessment on undeveloped, ready-to-build land from 2025 onwards for urban development reasons.

Real Property Tax Exemptions

According to the German property tax law (§3 GrSTG) certain legal entities are exempt from property taxation. These include entities from the public sector like federal, state, and municipal authorities, as well as public institutions and foundations under public law, if they use the property for public purposes only. An exemption from property taxation is also made for non-profit organisations, that pursue exclusively and directly charitable, religious, cultural, scientific, or educational purposes. Besides, churches and other religious communities are exempt from property taxation if the property is used exclusively for religious or charitable purposes.

Real Property Transfer Tax

The real property transfer tax (Grunderwerbssteuer) is imposed when a domestic property is sold or when the ownership is subject to change. The tax rate is set by the federal state in which the property is located. It ranges from 3.5 to 6.5 percent. It is a one-time payment which is levied on properties whose purchase price exceeds EUR 2.500 and is typically paid for by the buyer. The real property transfer tax is also levied if at least 95 percent interests in a partnership are transferred to new partners within five years or if at least 95 percent of the shares of a company, which owns a property, is transferred to a new shareholder.

===Greece===
Greece has a Municipal and a Government property tax. The municipal property tax (ΤΑΠ/ΔΤ/ΔΦ) is included in electricity bills and incorporates, among others, charges for street cleaning and lighting. The Government property tax (ENFIA) is a combination of the individual asset&#x27;s tax based upon floor-area and a progressive real-estate wealth tax per individual which is based on the estimated net-worth of all properties and can reach 2%.

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, the property tax is not an &quot;ad valorem tax&quot;; it is actually an income tax. The taxes that are levied on the value of real estates themselves are called rates and government rent instead.

According to HK Inland Revenue Ordinance IRO s5B, property owners must pay this tax only if they received a consideration such as rental income for the year of assessment. The property tax is computed on the net assessable value at the standard rate. The period of assessment is from 1 April to 31 March.

====Net assessable value====
The formula is:

:Net assessable value = 80% of Assessable value.

:HK property tax payable = Net assessment value X Property tax standard rate

:Assessable value = Rental income + Premium + (Rental bad debt recovered — Irrecoverable rent) – Rates paid by owner.

===India===
Property taxes are levied by either state government or local civic bodies. Property tax or &#x27;house tax&#x27; is a local tax on buildings, along with appurtenant land. It is imposed on the Possessor (not the custodian of property as per 1978, 44th amendment of the constitution). It resembles the US-type wealth tax and differs from the excise-type UK rate. The tax power is vested in the states and is delegated to local bodies, specifying the valuation method, rate band, and collection procedures. The tax base is the annual rental value (ARV) or area-based rating. Owner-occupied and other properties not producing rent are assessed on cost and then converted into ARV by applying a percentage of cost, usually four percent. Most big-city municipals have tax on vacant lands, and other smaller cities and rural areas don&#x27;t have any property tax on vacant lands. In most cases, civic bodies have taxes exempted on all the buildings and lands used for: religious worship by the public; public burial &amp; cremation; or charitable &amp; educational purposes. Some agricultural or heritage lands are also exempt. Other than that, Central government properties are exempt. Instead, a &quot;service charge&quot; is permissible under executive order. Properties of foreign missions also enjoy tax exemption without requiring reciprocity. The tax is usually accompanied by service taxes, e.g., water tax, drainage tax, conservancy (sanitation) tax, lighting tax, all using the same tax base. The rate structure is flat on rural (panchayat) properties, but in the urban (municipal) areas it is mildly progressive with about 80% of assessments falling in the first two brackets.

Below are details of certain local civic bodies:
===Ireland===

A Local Property Tax came into effect in the Republic of Ireland on 1 July 2013, and is collected by the Revenue Commissioners. The tax is on residential properties. The property owner is liable (though in the case of leases for longer than twenty years, the tenant is liable). The revenue funds the provision of services by local authorities. Such services include public parks, libraries, open spaces and leisure amenities, planning and development, fire and emergency services, maintenance, and street cleaning and lighting.

The tax is based upon market value, taxed via a system of market bands. the initial national central rate of the tax is 0.18% of a property&#x27;s value up to €1 million. Properties valued over €1 million are assessed 0.25% on the excess. From 1 January 2015 local authorities can vary LPT rates at up to 15% below or above the national central rate.

In the case of properties valued over €1 million, no banding applies – 0.18% is charged on the first €1 million (€1,800) and 0.25% on the balance. The government estimates that 85% to 90% of all properties fall within the first five taxation bands.

=== Italy ===
In Italy property tax includes municipal property tax, transfer tax, and value-added tax (VAT).

* Immobiliare (Real Estate) Tax: The primary property tax in Italy is the Imposta Municipale Unica (IMU), commonly known as the municipal property tax. The tax is charged on the ownership of buildings, buildable areas and agriculturallands situated within the Italian territory. IMU is an annual tax levied on the cadastral income of the property, with rates varying based on the municipality. Typically, IMU rates range from 0.4% to 0.8%, and the tax is due by September 30 each year. There are two exceptions for IMU. First, the building used as a first house by the taxpayer. Second, according to the Law 208/2015, the agricultural land, cultivated, owned and run by farmers and professional agricultural entrepreneurs.
* Transfer Tax: The Imposta di Registro, or Registration Tax is applicable during property transactions and varies based on the property type, with rates ranging from 2% to 9%. This imposta di registro is necessary because all citizens are obliged to make an official record of all changes of deeds in a public register, in this case the Tax Agency Office (Ufficio dell’Agenzia delle Entrate).
* Value Added Tax (VAT): Buyers of new properties or those substantially renovated may be subject to Value Added Tax (VAT) at rates between 4% and 22%, depending on the property&#x27;s type and location.

The total property tax amount paid in Italy depends on factors such as property value, location, and residency status.

Foreign nationals owning property in Italy should be aware of their tax obligations. While Italy does not impose specific property taxes based solely on foreign nationality, individuals must comply with reporting requirements for foreign assets and income under Italian tax laws. Failure to meet these obligations can lead to penalties.

Imposta sul valore degli immobili situati all’estero (LVIE) is a wealth tax on real estate properties owned outside of Italy. Italian residents who own property abroad are obliged to pay the LVIE. The tax is paid by:

* owners of real estate for any use whatsoever, including those instrumental by nature
* Individuals possessing rights in rem such as usufruct, use, habitation, emphyteusis, and surface over the same property
* concessionaires, in the case of concession of state-owned areas
* renters, especially in the context of real estate, which can involve properties either currently being built or undergoing construction, leased through financing agreements.

The Imposta unica comunale (IUC) was a tax in the Italian tax system introduced by the Stability Law for 2014. The intention behind this tax was to make the regulations on local property taxation organic. Although its name implies a sense of unity, the IUC did not replace all municipal taxes; instead, it brought together three distinct components: the IMU (Imposta municipale propria), the TASI (Tributo per i servizi indivisibili) and the TARI (Tassa sui rifiuti). With the Budget Law 2020, TASI is abolished and replaced by the new IMU.

* IMU (Imposta municipale propria): Single municipal tax or own municipal tax is the tax due for the ownership of buildings, excluding main homes classified in cadastral categories.
* TASI (Tributo per i servizi indivisibili): The tax for indivisible services contributes to the financing of the indivisible services provided by the municipality (e.g.: roads, public lighting, green areas).
* TARI (Tassa sui rifiuti): The waste tax is the tax intended to finance the costs relating to the waste collection and disposal service and is payable by anyone who owns or holds for any reason premises or open areas liable to produce such waste.

=== Jamaica ===
This tax is paid annually and is based on a percentage of the unimproved value of a property.

=== Lithuania ===
The tax period for a property tax is a calendar year. Property tax rate ranging from 0.3% to 1% the tax value of real estate is determined by the municipality.

Since 1 January 2015 if the person&#x27;s property value is higher than 220,000 euros, then a 0.5 per cent tax applies to the excess.

===Luxembourg===
Property tax in Luxembourg is calculated on the basis of the property&#x27;s &quot;unitary value&quot; determined by tax authorities and levied by the communes. The tax is calculated as property unitary value * assessment rate * communal rate. The assessment rate is determined by the legislator and generally ranges from 0.7% to 1%. The communal rate is set by the communal authority and varies from 120% to 900% depending on the municipality.

Luxembourg has minimal property taxes compared to its neighbours in Benelux or in the European Union. It amounts to more or less €150 for a €500,000 apartment in Luxembourg City.

===Czech Republic===

There are two types of property tax in the Czech Republic: tax on estate and tax on real estate.

The subjects of the tax on estate are all estates in the legislation of the Czech Republic excepting particular exceptions: estates which are covered by taxed real estates (these estates are not taxed only on that part where the real estate is located), forests, body of water, estates with the goal of defence the country. The payer of the tax is the owner on this particular estate. There are different types of taxes on estate depending on purpose (fields have lower coefficient than estates denoted for industry). There is a difference in the tax on building sites. Building sides with no real estate on it have constant coefficient 2 Kč per square metre whereas buildings sites with real property (those part of the building sites which are not covered by that particular real property) are taxed according to number of citizens and location of particular village/town/city.

The subjects of the tax on real estate are all buildings and accommodation units in the legislation of the Czech Republic apart from those buildings composed of accommodation units that are already taxed (block of flats...). The payer is again the owner of the real estate. The tax base from buildings and accommodations units is the area of the built-up surface.

Facts for both taxes:

# All earnings stemming from property tax (paid by payers of taxes) in particular village/town/city goes via tax office back to that particular village/town/city
# Every village/town/city has an authorization for adjusting its coefficient on property tax (they are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 – which means how many times the originally assessed tax will be multiplied)
# Tax year is the calendar year
# Tax return must be handed by the end of January of the tax year. If payer did it in the previous tax year and circumstances of taxes did not change, then the payer does not have to hand tax return and the tax is assessed automatically by the relevant authority
# Tax is in two exactly the same repayments by the end of May and November respectively. (As far as normal non businesses are concerned)

Important notion: There is a difference between the person who pays tax physically and the person holds the tax burden. In this type of tax in the Czech Republic it is always the same person, that is why it is omitted.

===Moldova===
====Transnistria====
The law in Transnistria establishes tax rates for apartments (0.3%) and houses (0.2%).

===Netherlands===
Property tax (Dutch: &quot;Onroerendezaakbelasting (OZB)&quot;) is levied on property on a municipal basis. Only the owners of residential property and people who rent/own commercial space are taxed. People who rent a home do not pay property tax. Municipalities combine their property taxes with a tax for garbage collection and for the sewer system. Owners and users of property and land also pay taxes based on the value of property to the water boards for flood protection and water and wastewater treatment (&quot;waterschapsbelasting&quot;). A percentage of the value of a house (&quot;huurwaardeforfait&quot;) is added to the income of the owner, so the owner of a house pays more income tax. All property-related taxes are based on the value of the house estimated by the municipality.

Portugal has divided their property taxation into two brackets, pre-purchase taxes and post-purchase taxes (of property).

Pre-Purchase/ Purchasing Real Estate Taxes: 
If an individual is looking to buy real estate in Portugal, they can be expected to pay a multitude of taxes. First, the individual will have to pay the &#x27;Portugal Property Transfer Tax&#x27; (as referred to as &#x27;IMPOSTO MUNICIPAL SOBRE AS TRANSMISSÕES ONEROSAS DE IMÓVEIS). This tax is applied when there is a transfer of ownership of a certain property. The rates of this tax can range from as low as 1% and up to 8%-- these taxes are dependent on a few considerations, which include &quot;the purchase price for the real estate, the location of the property, and whether it is the first or second home in Portugal.&quot; In addition, a &#x27;Stamp Tax&#x27; (Imposto de Selo) will also be a prepurchase tax applied before the sale of real estate. This is one of the oldest taxes in Portugal, and it is applied to all the official paperwork, such as deeds, contracts, mortgage agreements, and bank statements that make the sale legal and &#x27;official&#x27; according to the courts. This responsibility &quot;is accounted for by the buyer, charged at a fixed rate of 0.8% of the property’s registered fiscal value.&quot;

Post Purchase Real Estate Taxes: 
Property Tax (also known as: “IMI – Imposto Municipal Sobre Imóveis”) is &quot;computed on the tax registration value of urban and rural properties located in Portuguese territory.&quot; IMI is based on the type of property one possesses: &quot;Urban property- 0.3 to 0.45%, Rural property- 0.8% Property owned by residents in offshores (except individuals)- 7.5%.&quot; There are also quite a few tax reductions and exemptions individuals can qualify/ take advantage of properties that are considered a permanent residence (only viable for three years), residencies that have an occupant with multiple dependents registered to them, property that is deemed low in value and is owned by individuals of a low socio-economic standard according to the government, property that is considered a part of the tourism circuit, property that can help with renewable energy and even stores deemed historical or culturally impactful.

===Slovakia===
The law in Slovakia distinguishes 3 types of the real estate tax (Slovak: &quot;Daň z nehnuteľností&quot;):
– Land tax
– Building tax
– Tax on apartments and non-residential premises in an apartment building.

The administration of real estate tax is handled by the municipality in whose territory the real estate lies. In cities with multiple city districts, the tax administration of real estate tax is handled by the department of local taxes and fees and not by the city districts. For example, Bratislava or Košice.

====Origin and termination of tax liability====
The tax liability arises on 1 January of the tax period following the tax period in which the taxpayer became the owner, administrator, tenant, or user of the taxable property and expires on 31 December of the tax period in which the taxpayer lost ownership, administration, lease or use of the real estate. If the taxpayer becomes the owner, administrator, tenant, or user of the real estate on 1 January, the current tax period, the tax liability arises on this day.
The decisive factor for the collection of the tax as of 1 January is one tax period. Changes in taxable facts that occur during the tax period are not taken into account.

====Declaration====
The tax return is filed by the taxpayer, whose law on local taxes defines separately for land, buildings, flats, and non-residential parameters. The taxpayer files a tax return for the tax period in which the tax liability was incurred. The taxpayer (i.e. the taxable person) is obliged to pay the real estate tax return to the relevant tax administrator (i.e. the Municipality) by 31 January of the liability period. In other tax periods, the tax return is not filed and the taxpayer receives a decision on the tax levied from the administrator. For example, if you acquire a property on 25 August 2019, you are required to pay the tax return by 31 January 2020. However, only if the property will be registered in the real estate cadastre on 1 January 2020. A taxpayer who acquired the property by auctioning during the tax period is obliged to state the return within 30 days from the date of the tax liability.

====Co-ownership====
If the land, building, flat and non-residential space in a residential building are co-owned by several persons, the declaration shall be submitted by each individual or legal person. Specifically, the co-owner should state real estate tax up to the amount of his co-ownership share. If the co-owners agree, the declaration will be submitted by a chosen representative. If this occurs all co-owners are obliged to mention this fact in the declaration. This does not apply to spouses who own land, a building, a flat, or a non-residential space in an apartment building in the non-share co-ownership of the spouses. In this case, the declaration is filed by one of the spouses.

====How to proceed when filing a tax return====
The tax return is filed in the prescribed documentation depending on whether it is an individual or a legal entity. To complete the documentation, it is necessary to send documents that prove changes in one&#x27;s property (e.g. a copy of the decision to allow a deposit in the real estate cadastre, a decision on inheritance, etc.). Possible changes in the ownership of real estate are, for example, the sale or purchase of the real estate, inheritance, donation, building approval, removal of the building, and the like. The duly completed form must be submitted to the city or municipal office in person or appoint a representative.

====Electronic services====
The law does not stipulate the obligation of the municipality to finance electronic services, and thus e.g. during the tax return by electronic means while providing for the possibility of providing them. Whether it is possible to communicate with the tax administrator electronically, the municipality shall publish on its website in the form of an adopted generally binding regulation in which the details of electronic communication and provision of electronic services are laid down.

====Exemption from tax====
* land, buildings, flats, and non-residential premises owned by the municipality which is the tax administrator, and land, buildings, flats, and non-residential premises owned or managed by city districts in Bratislava and Košice,
* land and buildings owned by another state used by individual who have privileges and immunities under international law and are not citizens of the Slovak Republic provided that reciprocity is guaranteed,
* land and buildings or parts thereof owned by churches and religious societies registered by the state, which are used for education, scientific research purposes, or the performance of religious ceremonies,
* land and buildings or parts thereof owned by public universities or owned by the state under the administration of state universities for higher education or scientific research purposes,
* land and buildings or parts thereof owned by the state under the administration of the Slovak Academy of Sciences or owned by public research institution used for scientific research purposes,
* land and buildings or parts thereof owned by the state or self-governing regions serving kindergartens, primary education, secondary education, and higher vocational education and serving practical training centers and if they are within the founding competence of the state or self-governing regions,
* lands of publicly accessible parks owned by medical facilities providing institutional health care,
* land, buildings, and non-residential premises owned by the Slovak Red Cross.

====Payment of tax====
The tax administrator will send an assessment for the relevant tax period, stating the amount of tax, usually by 15 May. The levied real estate tax is payable within 15 days from the date of entry into force of the decision.

The tax administrator may also determine the payment of real estate tax in installments, while the due date of individual installments shall be determined in the decision by which the tax is levied. If the tax levied is higher than EUR 33,000, the city/municipality shall determine the payment of the tax in at least two equal installments. You can also pay the tax at once but within the first installment.

====Sanctions====
If you do not file a tax return for real estate tax within the deadline, the tax administrator will impose a fine up to the amount of tax levied, not less than 5 euros, but not more than 3,000 euros.

=== Sweden ===

==== Municipal and national property taxes ====
There are following categories for single-family dwellings in Sweden:

* Single-family dwelling - municipal property tax is 0,75% of the property&#x27;s taxable value (limit - there is a maximum tax)
* Newly constructed single-family dwellings and owner-occupied flats 
** for valuation year after 2012 - not subject to any municipal property tax for the first 15 years
** for valuation year before 2012 different
** (valuation year = the year when the construction of the house was completed)
* Single family-dwelling presently under construction 
* Several residential buildings on the same plot of a single-family land plot
* Single-family dwelling on freehold land
* Leasehold land
* Undeveloped single-family plots

Other categories include Agriculture, Owner occupied flats, Tenement building, Industrial premises, etc.

Rental income is taxed as part of a taxpayer&#x27;s annual income.

==== Penalties ====
In case of submitting false or inadequate information in a tax return, the taxpayer faces a penalty. An individual can be charged up to 40% of the tax, the amount differs (depends on the type of disinformation).

In case of late filling the consequences are similar.

==== Payment ====
Tax payments are made in monthly instalments. Taxpayers have 90 days to pay any owed balance, in case of overpaying the money is refunded within a year from the end of the fiscal year.

=== Spain ===
Property tax in Spain refers to the various taxes associated with buying, selling, and owning real estate within the country&#x27;s borders. These taxes differ for residents and non-residents and encompass a range of fiscal obligations that property owners must navigate.

Buying Property Tax: The acquisition of property in Spain entails the payment of several taxes, typically ranging from 8% to 11.5% of the property&#x27;s value. This applies to both newly built properties, often sold by banks or construction companies, and resale properties previously owned by individuals. The tax burden is distributed among different parties involved in the transaction, with specific percentages allocated to various tax categories.

Selling Property Tax: When selling property in Spain, sellers face obligations related to Plusvalia and Capital Gains Tax.

* Plusvalia: A council tax which is a tax levied by the local Town Hall, calculated based on the increase in the land&#x27;s value (known as valor catastral) over the ownership period. Each beneficiary is responsible for paying the tax on any single asset exceeding their individual share of the asset&#x27;s value.
* Capital Gains Tax: The Capital Gains Tax is 19% for non residents from European Economic Area and 24% for non residents from other countries. For residents the capital gains tax ranges from 19% to 23% but they can also get tax relief if they have lived in the property for at least three years before selling it.

Real Estate Tax (Impuesto sobre Bienes Inmuebles): The tax is imposed on the value of ownership and other rights pertaining to real estate situated within the municipality responsible for tax collection. The tax is levied by local councils. Its administration is a joint responsibility between the State Administration and local councils. It was enacted on January 1, 1990. The real estate tax ranges from 0.4% to 1.1% based on the region.

Refuse Collection: A small tax paid annually and collected by local municipality. It covers drainage &amp; refuse collection.

===United Kingdom===

In the UK the &quot;ownership&quot; of residential property or land is not taxed, a situation almost unique in the OECD. Instead, the Council Tax is usually paid by the &quot;resident&quot; of a property, and only in the case of unoccupied property does the owner become liable to pay it (although owners can often obtain a discount or an exemption for empty properties).

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) guidelines state:

:&quot;Council Tax is a tax on property. In principle it may be an allowable deduction in those instances where other property-based expenses are deductible.&quot;

The Valuation Tribunal Service states that:

:&quot;The tax is a mix of a property tax and a personal tax. Generally, where two or more persons reside in a dwelling the full tax is payable. If one person resides in the dwelling then 75% is payable. An empty dwelling attracts only a 50% charge unless the billing authority has made a determination otherwise.&quot;

The Council Tax depends on the value of the property, but is not calculated as a simple percentage. Instead, the property is allocated to a Council Tax band, (9 in England and 8 in Scotland and Wales). Valuation is carried out by the Valuation Office Agency under the auspices of HMRC.

Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) is a progressive tax which applies when purchasing &quot;a residential property or a piece of land in England or Northern Ireland&quot;. As of 2023, the purchase of a primary residence worth up to £250,000, by a UK resident, is tax-free with respect to SDLT. Some purchases by non-UK residents are subject to a further 2% surcharge. Purchases of non-primary residences are subject to an increased SDLT rate schedule. As of 2023, a first-time buyer of a primary residence receives SDLT relief, for properties worth up to £625,000, in the form of reduced SDLT rates (including a 0% bracket up to £425,000).

===United States===
In the United States, property tax on real estate is usually levied by the local government. The national government levies no real estate tax, nor property tax. State governments levy 3% of the total property tax collected. The other 97% is collected by counties, municipalities, schools, community colleges, and many other special-purpose governmental agencies, e.g. libraries, museums, parks, bridge authorities. Rates vary across the states, between about 0% and 4% of the home value. The assessment is made up of two components—the improvement or building value and the land or site value. The property tax is the main tax supporting local education, police, fire protection, government, roads, and most infrastructure, e.g. sewers, bridges, street lights. Many state and local jurisdictions add personal property taxes. (See exceptions below.)

==History of property tax==

Before the presence of a monetary system, taxes were mostly paid as a percentage of crops raised. Later, the property tax of ancient world, parts of medieval Europe and American colonies was rather based on the area of the property rather than on its value. Finally, the property&#x27;s gross output (e.g. annual income) were used as the base of taxation.

===Ancient times===

The first ever tax records, dating from about six thousand years BCE, were in the form of soil tablets which were found in city-state of Lagash (Now in the territory of current Iraq). The system was called bala (rotation). It was such that each month one particular area of city was taxed, which allowed to make such arduous task less difficult. In Ancient Egypt the taxes were levied against the value of grain, cattle, oil, beer and also land. By that time only one person out of 100 were literate. Some of these people were tax assessors. They kept records about owners of land along with its size. They collected annual data by calculating cattle and checking the crop yields. If the taxpayer was not able to pay the tax, he was brought before the court. Tax assessors were highly respected people due to their ability and skills.

===Medieval times===
In England in the 11th century the taxes on land were paid by peasants who rented that land from its owner. The more productive the land was the higher the rent was. During the 1070s, William the Conqueror established an early form of land taxation. It was common that cities kept records of the owner of the property. Each parcel was measured and estimated. Later, after 1215, King John was limited in his power to raise revenue, so from this point taxes could be collected only with permission of his barons. After 1290 normal people started paying this type of tax based on the location of the property (higher for those in cities and lower for rural residents) In 16th century even the King&#x27;s own land was also taxed. The King&#x27;s power of taxation became even weaker right after 1689 when the new law was introduced meaning that he could not tax without Parliament&#x27;s permission.

===The Thirteen Colonies===
Arriving in the New World, the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth and started building their city in 1620. Pilgrims formed a pact to protect themselves and also set laws including taxation and assessments. All people were allocated equal proportion of land from which they had to pay tax.

In Boston, a property tax was implemented by Puritans for paying the expenses of church and religious education. Every person paid this property tax regardless of one&#x27;s religion. This particular system lasted for more than one hundred years. The assessor of the tax was the sheriff. The system of evidence was similar to England (the assessors kept records of personal estate). The situation of the citizen was taken into account as far as the property tax was concerned – meaning that a widow with children was not only forgiven property tax but also was guaranteed to receive a certain amount of money monthly. On the other hand, people who destroyed public property had to pay the cost of repairs with property tax.

===The United States===

After the establishment of the United States in 1776, taxes were raised in most regions (mostly through property). Later, the central Government found out that this system did not work as far more was spent than received from this measure. At the end of the 18th century, there was a dispute between Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. The camp of Hamilton was for raising taxes (mainly property tax) centrally in order to increase the capacity of budget (also power) of the Government. The camp of Jefferson was for raising revenue locally as it &quot;sounded&quot; more like a concept of democracy. Hamilton had a strong head for finance; he helped to establish the capitalist system that exists today. However, the financial strategy mentioned above (high property tax) was a disaster for him.
Higher taxes (especially property) was finally established during the concerns whether the war with France would happen or not. National property tax was enacted by Congress apportioned by population. There were many protests until the tax was finally repealed. On the other hand, the trend of raising the local property tax continued as local governments were able to raise their revenue by this measure.

====The 20th century====
At the beginning of the 20th century, it was found out that the tax system in US could not equitably tax the complicated economy. Many reforms were implemented (trying to reduce reliance on property taxes). The most important one was concerned with new narrow personal property tax was established especially for homeowners and intangible assets. Many US presidents have tried to push for lower property tax and for the implementation of income tax. 
By the time of the Great Depression, the property tax collection rates dropped as people&#x27;s income decreased steeply. The Governments mostly cut property tax and implemented sales taxes. After the Great Depression, many movements were formed for addressing claims on the Government with real tax reforms. Many of these reforms were approved and remain the current law.

====Criticism====
Critics of property taxes note that this type of tax demonstrates that so-called &quot;property owners&quot; are renters of their land and that the government is regarded as the final owner since the property owners can be evicted at any time for failure to pay this tax. For example, a resident of Southfield, Michigan, was evicted from her home for missing a $900 property tax payment. The town refused to accept her late payment and instead confiscated and sold her nearly $300,000 home. Critics note that instances like this are a fairly frequent occurrence and demonstrate a threat to property rights, due process, and the rule of law.

==Places without property tax==

===East Asia===
* : The Chinese government owns all lands in China and the government does not tax homeowners.

===Middle East===

===Africa===

===North America===

===Europe===
* 

===Oceania===
* 
* 

===United States===
In Alaska, &quot;...only a small portion of the land mass is subject to a property tax. ...only 24 municipalities in Alaska (either cities or boroughs) levy a property tax.&quot; However, the vast majority of revenue for local governments comes from property taxes. There is no tax on the private land in American Samoa, the Territory of Palmyra Island or Kingman Reef in the Pacific Ocean insular areas.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Coopers is one of the livery companies of the City of London. The organisation of coopers existed in 1422; the Company received its first royal charter of incorporation in 1501. The cooper trade involved the making of wine, beer, and spirit casks (a barrel is specifically a 36-gallon cask, or 32 in some circumstances); the Livery Company also functions as a charitable foundation, and supports two education establishments: the Coopers&#x27; Company and Coborn School of Upminster, Essex, and Strode&#x27;s College of Egham, Surrey. The former was founded in the Ratcliffe area of London in 1536 and donated to the Company who have been involved with it ever since.

The Coopers&#x27; Company ranks 36th in the order of precedence of the 111 livery companies. Its motto is &quot;Love as Brethren&quot;.

== History==

1299: Acquisition of original deed of land in Basinghall Street.

1396: Request to Mayor for regulation against improper vessel construction.

1409: Decree for liquor vessels to be made solely of pure wood.

1420-1422: Introduction of individual cooper marks and official swearing in of Wardens.

1428-1464: Series of petitions for trade regulation, initiation of the &quot;Vellum&quot; book recording Warden names and brethren, and ordinances against inferior wood vessels, including a notable instance in 1464 where poor-quality barrels were burnt in Cheapside.

1643: Sale of Company&#x27;s plate to finance the Parliamentary armies.

1653-1658: Administrative changes including meeting schedules and election procedures.

1660-1685: Significant events like the introduction of the Brazil Staff, the rebuilding and completion of the Hall, and the revision of the Company&#x27;s Charter under Charles II.

Georgian Age

1715-1746: Acquisition and bequest of estates, construction of barges, and significant refurbishment of Egham School and Almshouses.

1767-1816: Involvement of Sir James Esdaile as a prominent member and Lord Mayor, installation of gas lighting in the Hall, and various building projects including the rebuilding of Ratcliffe School and Chapel.

1840-1898: Division of the Clerk&#x27;s office roles, leadership of David Salomons and J.F. Firth in various capacities, establishment and movement of the Girls School, formation of the Stepney &amp; Bow Educational Foundation, and the construction of the third Hall.

20th Century and Beyond

1904-2017: Introduction of the silver-gilt chain for the Master, numerous rebuilds and relocations of the Hall and schools, significant damage during WWII, establishment of new charitable foundations, and modernization including the admission of women to the Livery in 1999, and the election of the first female Master in 2022.

== Hall==
Their guild hall was first founded in the Bassishaw City ward in 1522, at The Swan tavern and from 1547 in a purpose-built livery hall. The hall was hired out for feasts by other companies and religious groups, and was used for drawings of government lotteries.
This hall was destroyed by the Great Fire of London in 1666 but subsequently rebuilt on the same site. 
The guild rebuilt again in 1865, selling a part of the site to the City of London Corporation for the expansion of Guildhall. This hall was destroyed by fire on the night of 29 December 1940. The livery then shared quarters with other Companies until purchasing their current headquarters in Devonshire Square, off Bishopsgate.

== Grant of Arms==

A Grant of Arms was made by Thomas Wrythe or Wriothesley, Garter, September 27, 1509.

Shield
&quot;Gyronny of eight Gules and Sable, on a chevron between three annulets Or a royne between two adzes Azure, a chief Vert thereon three lilies slipped stalked and leaved Argent.&quot;

Crest
&quot;Crest on a wreath Or and Argent, a demi heath cock the body Azure semée with annulets Or with the wings Argent semee of annulets Sable holding in the beak a lily Argent slipped and leaved Vert.&quot;

Supporters
&quot;On either side a camel Gules semee of annulets bridled Or.&quot;

The original Arms, before the reformation, bears the words &quot;‘Gaude Maria Virgo’&quot;. &quot;Gaude Maria Virgo&quot; marks the beginning of an antiphon for the psalms in the third nocturne of Matins on certain feasts of Our Lady. It is also featured in the hymn performed prior to the Gospel during Masses of Our Lady from Christmas to Easter. The variation &quot;Gaude et laetare Virgo Maria&quot; appears in a renowned Easter Anthem.

== The Society of the Livery==

Early 19th Century Financial Concerns and Livery Involvement

In the early 19th century, members of the Livery became increasingly concerned with financial mismanagement within their Company. A notable issue was the discovery that the Company was indebted to its Clerk by £1,000, a significant sum at the time, which effectively transferred control over the income from the Company&#x27;s rents to the Clerk.

This situation rekindled the Livery&#x27;s interest in their rights and involvement in the Company&#x27;s affairs. James Firth, a young Liveryman working as an archivist in the Town Clerk&#x27;s office at Guildhall, led the movement. His access to the Company&#x27;s Charters through his professional role provided valuable insights, influencing the Livery&#x27;s approach to addressing these concerns.

Resignation of the Clerk and Shift in Governance

The unfolding financial scandal saw to the resignation of the Clerk. Concurrently, nominations were being accepted for the roles of Master and Wardens of the Company. Seizing this opportunity, the Livery nominated its own candidate for the position of Under Warden. Abraham Algar, the Livery&#x27;s nominee, was elected in 1824, marking a significant shift in the Company&#x27;s power dynamics. The Livery&#x27;s ability to outvote the Court, the governing body, was unprecedented and reflected a changing landscape in the governance of such institutions.

Establishment of the Society and Lasting Changes

In response to these events, the Society of the Livery of the Worshipful Company of Coopers was established in 1827. Its primary objective was to uphold the rights of the Livery, particularly in electing the Wardens of the Company. The Society also functioned as a constitutional watchdog and evolved into a social club to enhance participation among Liverymen.

The influence of the Livery continued to grow, and by 1883, the convention of the Livery nominating the Under Warden was widely accepted, receiving formal recognition in 1886. This period marked a significant transition in the governance and social dynamics within the Company.

Legacy and Contemporary Role

Today, the Society remains active, organising nominations for the Under and Upper Wardens of the Company and running an events programme to foster fellowship. This ongoing role underscores the lasting impact of the events in the early 19th century on the governance and social structure of the Company.

== The Company Today ==
Promoting the craft and its history

In 2015, the idea of a Company mascot for the Coopers&#x27; Company was conceived by then Clerk, Adrian Carroll, and Liveryman Alan Roberts. Ajax, a Shire horse owned by Alan, was chosen due to the historical association of heavy horses with the cooperage trade. Ajax was invested as an Honorary Freeman of the Company at Coopers Hall, accompanied by City of London Mounted Police horses. In 2016, he was made an Honorary Liveryman. Ajax participates in various promotional activities for the Company, including visits to RAF Brize Norton, annual services at the Tower of London, and Open Days at Coopers’ Hall. He also carries two English Oak pin casks made by Master Cooper Alistair Simms, decorated with the Company badge. Additionally, Ajax has helped foster the Coopers’ Company&#x27;s affiliation with the Household Cavalry and performs promotional work at Hook Norton Brewery and plans a visit to Westons Cider Company.

Following the pandemic, the Company has launched a range of new initiatives to raise awareness of the Livery, craft, and its history.

In June 2022, Company inaugurated its Cask Rolling Race at Guildhall Yard, an event that has since become an annual highlight.

In July 2023, the Company established a new annual event, one to honour the feast of St Abdon, the Coopers’ patron saint. This was the first time in the Company’s recorded history where it brewed its own beer, Abdon’s Ale, in collaboration with Hook Norton Brewery.

== List of Coopers as Lord Mayor of London ==

<text>The Worshipful Company of Tylers and Bricklayers is one of the livery companies of the City of London. The organisation of Tylers (roof and floor tile layers) and Bricklayers existed in 1416; it was incorporated by a royal charter in 1568. Originally, the company possessed a monopoly over bricklaying within the City of London. However, after the Great Fire of London, the king decreed that brick or stone, instead of timber, should be used as the main supporting structure of buildings. There was too much rebuilding to be done by only the Tylers&#x27; and Bricklayers&#x27; Company; craftsmen from across England were summoned, and the monopoly was terminated. The company now exists, along with most livery companies, primarily as a charitable body. The company also supports various building schools.
The Tylers&#x27; and Bricklayers&#x27; Company ranks thirty-seventh in the order of precedence of livery companies.

==Brief history==

The earliest reference to the company is in 1416 though records show that a guild representing the crafts was in existence well before that time. The company&#x27;s charter was granted in 1568. A City ordinance of 1570 defined its area of control as being within a radius of 15 miles of the City.

The company flourished initially with brick and tiles being widely adopted in place of timber and thatch. The Great Fire of 1666 led to a royal proclamation requiring their use. The scope and scale of the rebuilding programme was beyond the capacity of company members alone; craftsmen flocked in from elsewhere and the monopoly was broken. The succeeding years saw a continuing reduction in the influence and fortunes of the company which nonetheless retained ownership of a hail until the end of the 19th century and almshouses in Islington into the second half of the 20th century. Masters and liverymen of the company have ensured that it still plays its part in support of the City, its crafts and numerous charitable causes.

Two of the company&#x27;s liverymen have served as Lord Mayor of London.

==Membership==

Members of the company are drawn from a very wide range of backgrounds. Applications are welcomed not only from those with family, craft or professional links with the company but also from anyone, working in the City or elsewhere, or retired, who wishes to support and uphold the objectives of the company set out on the cover.

==Fellowship and social activities==

A range of social and educational events are arranged which allow members, their wives and guests the opportunity of dining in some of the City&#x27;s finest livery halls and of visiting some of its greatest and historic institutions.

==Support for the crafts==

The company, unusually for livery companies, supports three separate recognised crafts within the building industry. These are bricklaying, roof slating and tiling, and hard-surface wall and floor tiling – crafts which are each as relevant today as they were five hundred years ago.
The company has always taken a special interest in those training in these crafts. It awards prizes for excellence achieved by students on courses at vocational colleges and in The Corps of Royal Engineers, the company&#x27;s link regiment, and also for success in craft competitions such as Skillbuild. It is actively involved in a scheme leading to the revived qualification of Master Craftsman. Every three years the company makes awards in each of its crafts to buildings or projects completed in that period.

==Awards==

The company makes a number of awards as part of its historic commitment to encouraging the very highest levels of craftsmanship in – bricklaying, roof slating and tiling and hard-surface wall and floor tiling – crafts which are as relevant today as they were five hundred years ago.

=== Craft Awards ===

Each year it makes awards to college students and military trainees. These are, respectively, to the students who come through the regional heats of the annual SkillBuild competition to win the national final in each of the three crafts and to Senior and Junior construction trainees at the Corps of Royal Engineers’ Training School at Chatham.

=== Triennial Awards ===

Every three years the company makes an award to the three buildings or structures, in the area bounded by the M25 motorway, which respectively embody the most outstanding example of brickwork, of slated or tiled roof and of hard-surface tiled wall and/or floor. All those principally responsible for each Tylers and Bricklayers Triennial Award-winning scheme are recognised, with the company&#x27;s Silver Medal being presented to the craft trade foreman.

=== Master Craftsman ===

The company also recognises those who achieve higher levels of competence in the crafts of bricklaying, roof tiling &amp; slating through a combination of their own training, practical site experience and a willingness to assist in the training of others. This recognition takes the form of the award of Master Craftsman status at the company&#x27;s Craft Awards Luncheon in March.

==Charitable activities==

Historically, the livery companies have supported a wide spectrum of charitable causes; the company has established two trust funds to enable it to play its part in such work. All members are expected to contribute to the Charitable Trust and the Craft Trust which support, among other causes, children&#x27;s education and sponsorship of academic and craft prizes.

<doc id="373828" wikidata="Q17176325" url="?curid=373828" title="Claude Cat">
<text>Claude Cat is an animated cartoon character in the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of cartoons from Warner Brothers.

==Character biography==
Claude Cat had his origins in several other cat characters used by animator Chuck Jones from 1943 to 1946. These cats were mostly similar in appearance and temperament, with black fur and anxious personalities. For example, in the 1943 film &quot;The Aristo-Cat&quot;, Jones paired his unnamed cat against the mind-manipulating mouse duo, Hubie and Bertie. In the 1943 film &quot;Fin&#x27;n Catty,&quot; the same cat has a manipulation with water and a goldfish in the style of Sylvester and Tweety. He also appeared in &quot;Odor-able Kitty&quot; (1945; the debut of Pepé Le Pew), and in the 1946 film &quot;Roughly Squeaking&quot; (this early version of Claude was his last appearance with Hubie and Bertie before his official redesign in 1949).

Jones redesigned the neurotic feline for the 1949 film &quot;Mouse Wreckers&quot; (perhaps to distinguish him from Friz Freleng&#x27;s popular puss, Sylvester). The short is another Hubie and Bertie vehicle, only this time, the antagonist &quot;they&quot; antagonize is Claude, drawn as he would appear in all future cartoons: yellow, with a red shock of hair and a white belly (his exact markings, however, would vary from cartoon to cartoon). In this, as in all future Claude Cat cartoons, Jones&#x27; careful attention to personality is easily evident. Claude is a nervous and lazy animal. His attempts to protect his home from the manipulative mice Hubie and Bertie prove futile as the rodents torment him by (among other things) putting upside down and sideways landscape paintings and an aquarium in the windows or by nailing the furniture to the ceiling. Jones set the mice on Claude once more in the 1950 film &quot;The Hypo-Chondri-Cat&quot;. This time, the miniature Machiavellis convince the neurotic Claude that he is dead. Claude would run afoul of the mice once more in 1951&#x27;s &quot;Cheese Chasers&quot; and against another mouse duo in &quot;Mouse-Warming&quot; in 1952.

Jones added another idiosyncrasy to Claude&#x27;s id in another 1950 film, &quot;Two&#x27;s A Crowd&quot;. Here, Claude is scared out of his mind by a diminutive dog named Frisky Puppy, newly adopted by Claude&#x27;s owners. The main theme, however, is jealousy, as Claude&#x27;s attempts to oust the intruder repeatedly fail due to the cat&#x27;s intense cowardice - a running gag has Claude repeatedly leaping up and clinging to the ceiling, shivering in fear, after the puppy playfully comes up behind him and barks. At the end, however Claude gets revenge by sneaking up behind Frisky and barking, causing the puppy to leap up and cling to the ceiling, also shivering in fear. Jones repeated the scenario with slight variations in &quot;Terrier Stricken&quot; in 1952 and &quot;No Barking&quot; in 1954 (the latter featuring a cameo by Tweety at the end).

In future cartoons, Jones recast Claude as a silent villain, still possessing his full set of neuroses. This stage of the character&#x27;s evolution is best exemplified by the 1954 film &quot;Feline Frame-Up&quot; and in the 1958 film &quot;Cat Feud&quot;. In the first cartoon, Claude convinces his owner that fellow pet Marc Antony is trying to eat the precious kitten Pussyfoot. Marc Antony is tossed out, allowing Claude the run of the house; that is, until Marc Antony outwits the cat and makes him sign a confession admitting to his crimes. In the second cartoon that contains a similar, unnamed, cat character.

Claude&#x27;s final cartoon was in 1962&#x27;s &quot;Louvre Come Back to Me!&quot; where he is depicted as a French cat (named Pierre) that loved Penelope Pussycat, when he is insulted by Pepé Le Pew.

Claude was played by voice actor Mel Blanc using a quirky, strangulated voice similar to that of Marvin the Martian.

==Later appearances==
One of the versions of Claude Cat was planned to be made as a cameo in the deleted scene &quot;Acme&#x27;s Funeral&quot; from the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;. He appears with other animated characters scared when Casper appears at the funeral.

Claude appears in the episode &quot;Mr. Popular&#x27;s Rules of Cool&quot; of &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;.

Claude appeared as one of the spectators in the basketball game of the 1996 film &quot;Space Jam&quot;.

In the 2006 &quot;Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas&quot;, Claude Cat has a very brief cameo as a Lucky Duck Superstore employee going home for Christmas.

Claude briefly appears in &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot; opening.

Claude appears in several episodes of &quot;New Looney Tunes&quot;, voiced by John Kassir.

Claude also appeared with Hubie and Bertie in the &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot; short &quot;Frame the Feline&quot;, where he is voiced by Eric Bauza.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths ranks fortieth among the ancient livery companies of the City of London. 

First mentioned in a Court record of 1299, London&#x27;s blacksmiths evolved from a religious fraternity into a guild before being granted the status of a Company by Royal Charter in 1571. 

The Blacksmiths&#x27; Company originally determined trade regulations and standards from the City, but their rights gradually diminished as London expanded outwards. By the end of the eighteenth century, little remained of its former powers and so the Company did not the renew the lease of Blacksmiths&#x27; Hall which expired in 1785.

==Background==
Trustees continued to administer the Blacksmiths&#x27; funds. From 1828 there was a renewed energy on the social aspects of the Company. After 1890 there was a renewed connection with the craft of blacksmithing, and by 1934 this extended throughout Great Britain rather than just the City of London and its environs. 

Many of its Livery members (both male and female) continue to be practising blacksmiths.

The Court of the Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths, on the advice of its Craft Committee, awards a range of Certificates, Diplomas and Medals: these recognise various degrees of ability and quality of workmanship achievable by training and experience of Blacksmiths working as individuals and when working as a team. The awards range from a Certificate of Competence and a Journeyman&#x27;s Certificate for apprentices starting out on their careers to a Gold Medal for consistent work of very high quality in prestigious commissions given to blacksmiths who have long experience in the craft.

The Company provides judges and prizes at County Shows throughout the UK, and maintains a charitable trust making donations, principally in support of apprentice blacksmiths.

Ranking fortieth in the order of precedence of City Livery Companies, its motto is &quot;By Hammer and Hand All Arts Do Stand&quot;.

Lord Mayor-elect Alastair King served as Prime Warden Blacksmith for 2021/22.

<doc id="373835" wikidata="Q1260610" url="?curid=373835" title="Jessica Savitch">
<text>Jessica Beth Savitch (February 1, 1947 – October 23, 1983) was an American television journalist who was the weekend anchor of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; and daily newsreader for NBC News during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Savitch was one of the first women to anchor an evening network newscast alone, following in the footsteps of Marlene Sanders of ABC News and Catherine Mackin of NBC News. She also hosted PBS&#x27;s public affairs program &quot;Frontline&quot; from its January 1983 debut until her death in a car crash the following October.

Savitch was known for her audience appeal and her skill as an on-camera news reader, although she drew criticism for her relative lack of journalism experience. Prior to joining NBC News, she was a popular local anchorwoman in Philadelphia and before that, while working at a Houston television station, she was the first female news anchor in the South.

==Early life==
Jessica Savitch was born on February 1, 1947, in Wilmington, Delaware. She was the eldest daughter of Florence (née Goldberger), a navy nurse, and David “Buddy” Savitch, who ran a clothing store. Her father was of Slavic and Jewish heritage and her maternal grandfather was of German and Russian Jewish heritage. Her maternal grandmother was of Italian American heritage and she was also Catholic.

Buddy Savitch suffered from nephritis, an incurable kidney disease. He died on May 11, 1959, when he was 33 and Jessica was 12. Her family then moved from Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, to Margate City, New Jersey. While attending Atlantic City High School, Savitch got a job co-hosting a rock show for teenagers on radio station WOND in Pleasantville; she soon became a newsreader and disc jockey for WOND as well. She was the first female disc jockey in the Pleasantville area.

Following her graduation from high school, Savitch attended Ithaca College in Ithaca, New York, as a communications major. She was an announcer for the college’s television station, WICB, and worked in radio at nearby Rochester&#x27;s WBBF (now WROC-AM). There, she did voice-over commercial work, and became a popular top 40 disc jockey known as &quot;Honeybee&quot;. She graduated from Ithaca College in 1968, but remained connected to the college, returning periodically to teach a mini-course on television news.

==Local news career==
=== New York City ===
In 1969, Savitch was hired as an administrative assistant at WCBS, the CBS Radio flagship news station in New York City, where she also did freelance production work. WCBS refused to hire her as a reporter because she had no professional experience. With the permission of News Director Ed Joyce and the help of a three-person crew, Savitch used the WCBS-TV facilities to make a television audition tape and sent copies to hundreds of television stations around the country seeking an on-air position. This included all cities big enough to have all three networks. She received fewer than a dozen responses and only one job interview.

=== Houston ===
Despite her lack of broadcast news experience, Savitch was hired by KHOU-TV in Houston as the station&#x27;s first female reporter. Dick John, the manager who hired her, said he did so because he was impressed with her ambition as well as her copywriting and speaking skills. When Savitch arrived at KHOU, she was the only female working in the news department other than one secretary; colleagues helped her learn the basics of her job. Because KHOU was non-union, she participated in many aspects of production as well as reporting on camera. A few months after joining KHOU, Savitch auditioned for and won a weekend anchor shift, becoming the first female news anchor in the South and beginning to develop the formal, mannered style of news delivery for which she later became known. Her report on a train derailment and fire received national exposure on the &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; with Walter Cronkite.

=== Philadelphia ===
In 1972, Savitch joined KYW-TV, then the NBC affiliate (now CBS O&amp;O) in Philadelphia, as a general assignment reporter and weekend anchor under a five-year contract. Unlike the Houston station, this station was unionized, so Savitch was not permitted to do work other than on-camera newsreading and reporting. At the time KYW hired Savitch, it was under pressure from the Philadelphia chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW) to place more women in then-non-traditional roles on the local news or else face a possible legal challenge to its broadcast license. When she was initially unable to obtain a weeknight anchor shift, Savitch attempted to break her KYW contract and take a job offered by CBS in New York. KYW refused to release her from her contract but agreed to raise her salary and (partly to satisfy NOW) make her a weeknight anchor. Savitch soon began to anchor noon news broadcasts as well, and eventually became part of a popular team of three anchors with Mort Crim and Vince Leonard on the 11:00pm news. Philadelphia viewers responded enthusiastically to her on-camera presence, which was perceived as &quot;magical&quot; and triggering an &quot;almost emotional bond&quot; with the audience.

As a result of her KYW work, Savitch became a local celebrity in Philadelphia and was sometimes mobbed walking down the street. Male viewers schemed to meet her, and female viewers copied her hairstyle. Despite her local acclaim, Savitch aspired to leave local news and become a network correspondent.

Impressed with her performance, NBC offered her a three-year contract starting in September 1977 as a Washington, D.C. correspondent and anchor. Savitch did her last newscast for KYW in August 1977.

Savitch got along well with some members of the KYW staff, including her regular location shooting crew and her co-anchor Mort Crim. Crim later admitted that he was initially &quot;not nice to her&quot; due to his own male chauvinism, but the two later became good friends. (Crim delivered the eulogy at her memorial service after her death.)

=== Multi-part series ===
Savitch won recognition for multi-part feature stories on unusual (for that time) topics. For example, Philadelphia KYW news director Jim Topping, inspired by his and his wife’s experience attending Lamaze classes, assigned Savitch to cover a five-part series on natural childbirth. Savitch and her camera crew covered a local family who were expecting a second child. When it appeared this baby might not be born in time for the heavily advertised series, the crew even compiled a list of other expectant mothers in the area as back-up, although luckily the baby was born four days before the start date.

This series on childbirth began as scheduled on Monday and on Thursday, November 22, 1973 — Thanksgiving Day — showed much of the actual birth. &quot;Almost Golden&quot; states, “when KYW brought the scene into the audience’s living rooms on a warm holiday evening, it made for powerful television.” In addition, Topping told Savitch, “You&#x27;ve made your career.”

Savitch frequently personalized her stories by making herself a part of them, such as serving as an undercover decoy [with police officers unobtrusively posted along the route] for two weeks as part of her series about rape. This series, entitled &quot;Rape . . . the Ultimate Violation&quot;, won a Clarion Award for excellence from Women in Communications, Inc. In addition, KYW Philly received many requests for rebroadcast which it met. The series was also screened by community groups and state legislatures in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware, helping to bring about legislative changes, and motivating several state and local governments to open rape crisis centers.

For the series which was titled “Lady Law,” Savitch primarily interviewed female law enforcement professionals from other cities. However, she also completed the Philadelphia Police Academy&#x27;s training course, and she also engaged in activities such as shooting a handgun, jumping over oil barrels, squeezing under a barrier, and climbing a six-foot wall. This series won Savitch two awards, but it also left her with sore muscles and a “wrenched back” for some weeks afterwards.

Other multi-part series which starred Savitch included: single adults, marriage mills of Las Vegas, impact of divorce on American society, issue of when life begins and ends, Pennsylvania snow skiing in the Pocono Mountains, the “New Philadelphia Sound” in music, and traveling to Hollywood to interview Joey Bishop, Peter Boyle, Eddie Fisher and other Philadelphians who had made it big in show business.

=== Filling airtime during a technical problem which occurred during a 1976 Presidential debate ===
In 1976, she came to the attention of NBC executives while she was reporting from the first presidential campaign debate between President Gerald Ford and Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter, which was held at Philadelphia&#x27;s Walnut Street Theatre. An audio line failed, delaying the debate and leaving three KYW reporters, including Savitch, to fill the 27 minutes of air time before the audio could be restored. KYW producer Cliff Abromats stated, “She [Savitch] was very good on her feet. She could think fast and ask the right questions, and she had the ability so many lack, to actually listen to the answer. Jessica would never miss it when someone said something unexpected.”

==National news career==
=== NBC ===
Savitch joined NBC News in 1977 as a weekend anchor for &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;. In order to counter criticism that she had been hired for her looks and promoted ahead of skilled journalists, NBC also assigned her to do reporting work, including a brief stint as U.S. Senate correspondent.

Savitch was the network&#x27;s second woman to anchor a weekend national newscast; Catherine Mackin had previously anchored NBC&#x27;s Sunday evening newscast beginning in December 1976, before she left for ABC News the following year. Savitch later became the first woman to anchor the weeknight edition of &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, periodically substituting for the regular anchors John Chancellor and David Brinkley. She was also assigned to anchor short NBC News updates (initially called &quot;NBC News Update&quot;, later called &quot;NBC News Capsule&quot; and &quot;NBC News Digest&quot;) that ran approximately one minute and aired between regular prime time programs each evening, drawing a high number of viewers. She began to fill more roles in NBC&#x27;s news programming, serving as a regular panel member on &quot;Meet The Press&quot;, contributing to the news magazine programs &quot;Prime Time Saturday&quot; and &quot;Prime Time Sunday&quot;, and contributing commentary to the NBC Radio Network. She substituted as anchor on the &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Tomorrow&quot; shows. She was offered the anchor position for an early-morning news program &quot;Early Today&quot; but turned it down.

As a network anchor, Savitch had a charismatic presence and became popular with network affiliates and viewers. A 1982 &quot;TV Guide&quot; poll named her the fourth most trusted news anchor in the country, above many of the most established male anchors of the period. Another 1982 poll named her the &quot;sexiest&quot; female anchor in the country. Affiliates agreed to run the &quot;NBC News Update&quot; segments largely because she would be presenting them. Her success influenced numerous aspiring female newscasters to model themselves after her look and delivery. In 1980, she was one of the twelve most popular speakers in the United States.

Savitch constantly worked on improving her news reading delivery, using a voice coach and other techniques. NBC executives and colleagues praised her skillful narration of film showing the murders of Congressman Leo Ryan and several others in a mass shooting by members of the Peoples Temple at Jonestown. There had not been time to view the film prior to its broadcast, and Savitch had to improvise her narration while viewing the graphic film for the first time.

=== PBS anchor ===
In January 1983, in addition to her work for NBC, Savitch began hosting a new public affairs documentary program on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), &quot;Frontline&quot;. She continued as host until her death later that year, at which time Judy Woodruff took over as host.

=== October 3, 1983, live broadcast incident ===
Despite Savitch&#x27;s competence and success as an anchor, by 1983, NBC was beginning to shift its focus to other female anchors, particularly Connie Chung. In June 1983, NBC removed Savitch from her regular Saturday evening anchor slot and replaced her with Chung, who also accepted the &quot;Early Today&quot; position that Savitch had rejected. From then until her death in October 1983, Savitch&#x27;s only regular appearances on NBC were on the &quot;NBC News Digest&quot; segments. Savitch began feeling anxious about her job and showed signs of emotional instability.

On October 3, 1983, during an &quot;NBC News Digest&quot; segment, Savitch was slurring her speech, deviating from her script and ad-libbing her report. She performed a later segment without any issues that same evening. Savitch&#x27;s flawed delivery fueled speculation that she was using drugs, specifically cocaine. However, she blamed the problems on a teleprompter malfunction, while her agent said it was due to the effects of pain medication which she was taking in response to recent facial reconstructive surgery which she underwent following a boating accident.

While some of Savitch&#x27;s colleagues stated that they had seen evidence of drug use, other friends and associates of Savitch expressed skepticism because they did not believe that she had a drug problem. NBC correspondent Linda Ellerbee later said that she had asked network management to intervene, telling them, &quot;You have to do something. This woman [Savitch] is in trouble.&quot; Ellerbee said that a network vice president responded, &quot;We&#x27;re afraid to do anything. We&#x27;re afraid she&#x27;ll kill herself on our time.&quot; When management failed to act, Ellerbee and other correspondents had tried to reach out to Savitch, who died before anything could be done.

Although Gwenda Blair wrote that Savitch&#x27;s poor performance on the October 3 segment effectively ended her network career, a &quot;People&quot; magazine article which was published after her death stated that her NBC contract had actually been renewed (although the renewal was for just one year rather than her previous three-year contracts), that she would have reclaimed a spot as a substitute Sunday anchor for &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; in January 1984, and that she was set to appear on another season of &quot;Frontline&quot;.

==Personal life==
Savitch was married twice and had no children. Her first marriage in 1980 to Philadelphia advertising executive Melvin &quot;Mel&quot; Korn ended in divorce after eleven months. Korn reportedly divorced Savitch after learning that she had a significant drug problem.

Savitch&#x27;s second marriage in March 1981 to Dr. Donald Payne, her gynecologist, lasted only a few months. It ended when Payne, who had substance abuse problems of his own and suffered from depression, committed suicide by hanging in their Washington, D.C. townhouse. Savitch, who was in New York at the time, found his body when she returned; she returned to her work at NBC three weeks later.

Savitch had a long-term intermittent relationship with TV news executive Ron Kershaw, who had substance abuse problems and physically abused Savitch during their relationship. In the early 1970s, while she was working for CBS in New York City, Savitch also had a romantic relationship with CBS News journalist Ed Bradley, who was then a WCBS radio reporter. According to Bradley, after the relationship ended they continued to have a &quot;non-romantic, social, and professional relationship&quot; until her death.

According to her biographers Blair and Nash, Savitch was a driven perfectionist who constantly battled insecurities about her appearance and ability, suffered from social anxiety, and tended to isolate herself from network colleagues. Both biographers also write that Savitch had a problem with cocaine that eventually affected her career. Biographers have also asserted that Savitch was bisexual and had romantic relationships with women as well as men. These assertions were disputed by Savitch&#x27;s family and some of her friends after her death.
Savitch&#x27;s friend, WNBC anchor Sue Simmons, said in a 2013 retrospective article marking the 30th anniversary of Savitch&#x27;s death, &quot;When the books and the movie came out [after her death], they made her out to be this troubled character. Nobody ever talked about her big heart, her loyalty, her sense of humor, and her fabulousness as a person.&quot;

==Death==
On October 23, 1983, Savitch had dinner with Martin Fischbein, vice president of the &quot;New York Post&quot;, at the Chez Odette restaurant in New Hope, Pennsylvania. Savitch and Fischbein had been dating for a few weeks. They began to drive home about 7:15 p.m., with Fischbein driving and Savitch in the back seat with her dog, Chewy. It was raining heavily; Fischbein may have missed posted warning signs. He drove out of the wrong exit from the restaurant and up the towpath of the old Pennsylvania Canal&#x27;s Delaware Division on the Pennsylvania side of the Delaware River. The Oldsmobile Cutlass Cruiser station wagon veered too far to the left and went over the edge into the shallow water of the canal. After falling approximately and landing upside down in to of water, the car sank into deep mud that sealed the doors shut. Savitch and Fischbein were trapped inside as water poured in. A local resident found the wreck at about 11:30 that night. Fischbein&#x27;s body was still strapped behind the wheel, with Savitch and her dog in the back seat.

After autopsies, the Bucks County coroner ruled that both Savitch and Fischbein had died of asphyxiation by drowning. Neither Savitch nor Fischbein had any drugs other than alcohol in their systems, and they had consumed only small amounts of alcohol—about half a glass of wine each.

Savitch&#x27;s family and a group of her friends later sued the &quot;New York Post&quot; (whose insurance covered the leased car Fischbein was driving), Fischbein&#x27;s estate, Chez Odette, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for damages in Savitch&#x27;s death. The suit was settled for $8 million, most of which was paid by the &quot;Post&quot;. Some of the money was used to establish scholarships for women studying for careers in broadcasting or journalism at Ithaca College and other institutions.

==Awards and honors==
Savitch gave the main address at Ithaca College&#x27;s 1979 commencement, at which she was awarded an honorary doctorate of humane letters. In 1980, she was elected to the Ithaca College Board of Trustees. The school’s television Studio A is named in honor of Savitch, and the college&#x27;s Jessica Savitch Communications Scholarship was established to support students in the Roy H. Park School of Communications who demonstrate excellence, achievement, and promise in the field of broadcast journalism.

The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia posthumously inducted Savitch into their Hall of Fame in 2006.

==In popular culture==
Jessica Savitch published her own autobiography, &quot;Anchorwoman&quot;, in 1982. After her death, two posthumous biographies were written about her. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, each of her biographers interviewed over 300 people in order to write their respective books. Although both biographies contain similar material, Savitch&#x27;s family and friends have challenged as untrue portions of the books regarding her reporting skills and controversial aspects of her personal life (see Personal life).

The first biography, &quot;Almost Golden: Jessica Savitch and the Selling of Television News&quot; (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1988) by Gwenda Blair, told Savitch&#x27;s story within the broader context of the history of network news. It was later made into a Lifetime Network made-for-TV movie starring Sela Ward, called &quot;Almost Golden: The Jessica Savitch Story&quot;. When first aired, &quot;Almost Golden&quot; earned the second-highest rating ever for a cable television film up to that point. The television film was criticized for omitting or downplaying controversial aspects of Savitch&#x27;s life and career that were discussed at length in Blair&#x27;s book.

The second, &quot;Golden Girl: The Story of Jessica Savitch&quot; (Dutton, 1988) by Alanna Nash, became the basis of the 1996 theatrical film &quot;Up Close &amp; Personal&quot; starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert Redford. &quot;Up Close &amp; Personal&quot; was originally intended as a biographical film about Savitch. However, the plot of the movie was substantially changed to become a love story quite different from Savitch&#x27;s life. According to Nash and John Gregory Dunne (who co-wrote the screenplay with his wife Joan Didion and wrote the book &quot;&quot; about the making of the film), this was because the filmmakers, including The Walt Disney Company that was financing the film, considered Savitch&#x27;s life story too downbeat to be popular at the box office. Many reviews of the movie discuss how the film departed, probably for commercial reasons, from Savitch&#x27;s actual biography.

The A&amp;E series &quot;Biography&quot; featured an episode about Savitch and her relationship with her male peers, which inspired Will Ferrell to make the 2004 comedy film &quot;&quot;, whose two main characters were based on her and Mort Crim. Lifetime also aired a documentary entitled &quot;Intimate Portrait: Jessica Savitch&quot; that was based on the perspectives of Savitch biographer Alanna Nash.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Bowyers is one of the livery companies of the City of London.

Originally, bowyers (longbow-makers) and fletchers (arrow-makers) composed one organisation. However, in 1371, the fletchers petitioned the lord mayor to divide into their own company, the Worshipful Company of Fletchers. Demarcation disputes arose between the two over supervision until 1429, when a City ordinance defined their respective spheres. It was not until the late 1480s that the bowyers acquired a coat of arms and a set of coherent written ordinances.

The actual trade of the bowyers still survives. Although originally made for use in war and hunting, there is now some demand for longbows used in target archery. There are several practising bowyers in the membership of the company and it maintains a great interest in the craft. The bowyers are also involved in the sport of archery and give awards and medals each year at the Royal Toxophilite Society and school competitions.

The Bowyers&#x27; Company mostly exists as a charitable institution, as do a majority of the 111 livery companies, with a focus on giving to charities where it can make some difference. HMS &quot;Northumberland&quot; is affiliated to it. The Bowyers rank 38th in the order of precedence of the companies, immediately above the Worshipful Company of Fletchers. Uniquely, among all the city&#x27;s livery companies, companies without livery and guilds, it is the only company with a two-year officer and mastership cycle going back to at least 1488.

The company motto is &quot;Crecy, Poitiers, Agincourt&quot;, a reference to the Battle of Crécy, the Battle of Poitiers, and the Battle of Agincourt, all battles between medieval England and France in the Hundred Years&#x27; War in which longbows and English longbows were used to great effect by English and Welsh archers, before artillery took over towards the end of the war. The coat of arms contains three flotes, tools traditionally used for smoothing and shaping wood.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Fletchers is one of the livery companies of the City of London.

Originally, one organisation included both bowyers (longbow-makers) and fletchers (arrow-makers). However, in 1371, the fletchers petitioned the Lord Mayor to divide into their own Company, leaving the bowyers to form the Worshipful Company of Bowyers.

The trade of fletchers, considering the development of more technologically advanced weapons, has disappeared entirely. The Company still remains, however, primarily as a charitable institution, as do a majority of the 110 Livery Companies.
The Fletchers&#x27; Company ranks 39th in the order of precedence of the Livery Companies, immediately below the bowyers. Its motto is &quot;True and Sure&quot;.

<text>Bert Gustav Tommy Körberg (; born 4 July 1948) is a Swedish singer, actor and musician. English-speaking audiences know him best for his role as Anatoly/&quot;The Russian&quot; in the musical &quot;Chess&quot;. He played the role on the 1984 concept album, and on stage in the 1986 world premiere West End production in London, as well as several times since. Körberg has represented Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest twice: 1969 (when he finished ninth) and 1988 (when he finished twelfth).

Körberg has also played the lead role in many Swedish productions of other musicals.

==Career==
From 1965 to 1968, Körberg was a singer in the Swedish pop group Tom &amp; Mick &amp; Maniacs, which went through several name changes. In August 1967, the group released the single &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Taken Maria Away&quot;, a cover of an Adam Faith song from 1965. The song went on to top the official &quot;Tio i Topp&quot; record chart for six consecutive weeks. The group had two additional hits on the chart: &quot;Please, Please, Please&quot; reached number five in April 1967 and &quot;I (Who Have Nothing)&quot; peaked at number eight in February 1968.

Following Tom &amp; Mick &amp; Maniacs&#x27; break-up in 1968, Körberg released his first solo album &quot;Nature Boy&quot;.

Körberg has represented Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest on two occasions. In 1969 he finished ninth with &quot;Judy, min vän&quot; and in 1988 he finished twelfth with &quot;Stad i ljus&quot;.

He has also appeared in the Swedish productions of other musicals, usually in a starring role, including &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; and &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (as Jean Valjean). He was a supporting actor in the 1984 Swedish fantasy film &quot;Ronia, the Robber&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, based on the novel by the same name by Swedish author Astrid Lindgren.

Körberg voiced the Beast in the Swedish dub of &quot;Beauty and the Beast,&quot; and also sang the Swedish version of the title song on the soundtrack. In the 1990s and 2000s, he took time off from other projects in order to recreate the role of Anatoly/&quot;The Russian&quot; in subsequent productions of &quot;Chess&quot;, including the 1994 tenth anniversary concert and the 2002 Stockholm production. For years, he collaborated with Monica and Carl-Axel Dominique in the experimental group Solar Plexus. In his own performances, he has worked extensively with Stefan Nilsson, and including songs by Jacques Brel.

Körberg is also a frequent performer with Benny Andersson&#x27;s band, Benny Anderssons Orkester (BAO), singing mostly dance music and music by Andersson. In 2008 he starred in the musical &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot; at Cirkus in Stockholm, and in 2009 he played Professor Henry Higgins in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; in Stockholm acting opposite Helen Sjöholm, who portrayed the role of Eliza Doolittle.

In the autumn of 2010, Körberg and his long-time friend Claes Malmberg gave a show in Gothenburg called &quot;The Big Bang Show&quot;. He was one of three judges on the Swedish reality television singing competition &quot;True Talent&quot;, which ran for one season in 2011. In 2013 he tried out for Eurovision in Melodifestivalen 2013 with the song &quot;En Riktig Jävla Schlager&quot; with the group Ravaillacz. They ended up in 10th place in the final.

In 1995, he was invited as one of the seventeen Jean Valjeans from around the world to perform the encore of the Les Misérables 10th Anniversary Concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London.

In 2017, he appeared as a guest performer on the album &quot;Worlds Collide&quot; by Swedish metalcore band Dead By April, singing on the last song, &quot;For Every Step&quot;.

In January and February 2025, he&#x27;s set to return to &quot;Les Misérables&quot; in the Arena Spectacular World Tour as The Bishop of Digne opposite Peter Jöback as Valjean.

==Awards and honors==
In 1969, he won a Swedish Recording Industry Award Grammis in the category Best Debut Performance.

Körberg was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award in the category Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Musical, for his role in the 1986 world premiere of &quot;Chess&quot;.

For the 2002 Swedish production of &quot;Chess&quot;, he won a Guldmasken, the national Swedish theater award, in the category Best Actor in a Musical.

==Personal life==
Körberg was born in Norsjö. He is the father of actor and musician Anton Körberg, from his relationship with actress Anki Lidén. In July 2007, he married Anne-Charlotte Nilsson.

<doc id="373849" wikidata="Q1003981" url="?curid=373849" title="Music of Bulgaria">
<text>The music of Bulgaria refers to all forms of music associated with the country of Bulgaria, including classical, folk, popular music, and other forms.

Classical music, opera, and ballet are represented by composers Emanuil Manolov, Pancho Vladigerov and Georgi Atanasov and singers Ghena Dimitrova, Anna Tomowa-Sintow, Boris Hristov, Raina Kabaivanska and Nicolai Ghiaurov. Notable names from the contemporary pop scene are Lili Ivanova, Emil Dimitrov and Vasil Naydenov. Prominent Bulgarian artists living abroad include Sylvie Vartan, Kristian Kostov, Philipp Kirkorov, Lucy Diakovska, Mira Aroyo, Mikhael Paskalev, Nora Nova, Vasko Vassilev and Ivo Papazov.

The Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir has received a Grammy Award in 1990. The Philip Kutev Ensemble, the first of the Bulgarian state-sponsored folk ensembles and founded in 1951, also is featured on the 1990 Grammy-winning album and has had many well-known Bulgarian folk singers, including, at present, Neli Andreeva and Sorina Bogomilova. Rhodope folk singer Valya Balkanska has recorded the folk song &quot;Izlel ye Delyo Haydutin&quot;, which was included on the Golden Disk sent into space with the Voyager spacecraft in 1977.

==Instruments==

Bulgarian music uses a wide range of instruments. Some folk instruments are variants of traditional Asian instruments such as the &quot;Saz&quot; (Bulgarian tambura), or the kemençe (Bulgarian gadulka). More modern style instruments are often used in the modern dance music that is an offshoot of traditional village music.

Bulgarian folk bands, called bitovi, use instruments that commonly include
*The daire was a tambourine of varna folk music of eastern balkans of Bulgarian traditional musical instruments of rhopode regions closed was a sleigh bells or tambourine and big daire.
*The accordion is closed-keyboard instrument of rhopode region and strandja regions of Bulgaria keyboard instruments was bayan and the concertina
*The gaida, a traditional goat-skin bagpipe. There are two common types of gaida. The Thracian gaida is tuned either in D or in A. The Rhodopean gaida, called the kaba gaida, is larger, has a much deeper sound and is tuned in F.
*The kaval, an end-blown flute is very close to the Turkish kaval, as well as the Arabic &quot;Ney.&quot;
*The gadulka, a bowed stringed instrument perhaps descended from the rebec, held vertically, with melody and sympathetic strings. The bass gadulka has largely been replaced by the double bass (called in Bulgarian a contrabas).
*The tǔpan, a large drum worn over the shoulder by the player and hit with a beater (&quot;kiyak&quot;) on one side and a thin stick (&quot;osier&quot;) on the other.
*The tambura, a long-necked, metal-strung, fretted lute used for rhythmic accompaniment as well as melodic solos. It is somewhat like the Greek bouzouki and very similar to the Tamburica family&#x27;s &quot;alto&quot; instrument, the brac.
*The tarambuka or dumbek, an hourglass-shaped finger-drum. It is very similar to the Macedonia and Serbia &quot;darambuka&quot; and the Bulgaria&quot;Tarambuka&quot; (Тарамбука).

Modern professional musicians soon reached new heights of innovation in using traditional Bulgarian instruments, by expanding the capacities of the gaida (Kostadin Varimezov and Nikola Atanasov Plamen Deyanski), gadulka (Mihail Marinov, Atanas Vulchev Ganka, Zhechko tenev) and kaval (Stoyan Chobanov, Nikola Ganchev, Stoyan Velichkov, Nedyalko Nedyalkov, Theodosii Spassov. Other instruments arrived in Bulgaria in the 19th century, including the accordion and the clarinet. Bulgarian accordion music was defined by Boris Karlov and later Roma musicians including Kosta Kolev and Ibro Lolov ,Boshko.

In 1965, the Ministry of Culture founded the Koprivshtitsa National Music Festival, which has become an important event in showcasing Bulgarian music, singing and dance. It is held once every five years, and the last festival was 7–9 August 2015.

Instruments used in wedding music include violin, accordion, gaida, kaval, tapan, Tambura, guitar and Piano.

==Folk==
Regional styles abound in Bulgaria. Northern Bulgaria, Dobruja, Shopluk, Thrace, Strandzha, Macedonia and Rhodopes - all have distinctive sounds.

Some folk music revolves around holidays like Christmas, New Year&#x27;s Day, midsummer, and the Feast of St. Lazarus, as well as the Strandzha region&#x27;s unusual Nestinarstvo rites, in which villagers fall into a trance and dance on hot coals as part of the joint feast of Sts Konstantin and Elena on 21 May. Music is also a part of more personal celebrations such as weddings.

Singing has always been a tradition for both men and women. Songs were often sung by women at work parties such as the sedenka (often attended by young men and women in search of partners to court), betrothal ceremonies, and just for fun. Women also had an extensive repertoire of songs that they sang while working in the fields.

Young women eligible for marriage played a particularly important role at the dancing in the village square (which not too long ago was the major form of &quot;entertainment&quot; in the village and was a very important social scene). The dancing — every Sunday and for three days on major holidays like Easter — began not with instrumental music, but with two groups of young women singing, one leading each end of the dance line. Later on, instrumentalists might arrive and the singers would no longer lead the dance. A special form of song, the lament, was sung not only at funerals but also when young men departed for military service.

Bulgarian folk music is known for its &quot;asymmetrical&quot; rhythms (defined by the famous Hungarian composer and ethnomusicologist Béla Bartók as &quot;Bulgarian rhythms&quot;), where meter is split into uneven combinations of short (two metric units) and long (three metric units) beats, corresponding to the dancers&#x27; short and long steps. In European folk music, such asymmetrical rhythms are commonly used in Bulgaria, Greece, elsewhere in the Balkans, and less commonly in Norway and Sweden.

The most important state-supported folk ensemble of the socialist era was the Sofia-based State Ensemble for Folk Songs and Dances, founded in 1951 and led by Philip Koutev. Koutev became perhaps the most influential musician of 20th century Bulgaria, and arranged rural music with harmonies more &quot;accessible&quot; to audiences in other countries, to great domestic acclaim. The ensemble has now been renamed the Philip Kutev Ensemble in his honor. In 1952, Georgi Boyadzhiev founded the group known today as the Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir, which became famous worldwide after the release of a series of recordings entitled &quot;Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares&quot;.

The distinctive sounds of women&#x27;s choirs in Bulgarian folk music come from their unique rhythms, harmony and vocal production. Characteristic polyphony, such as the use of close intervals like the major second and the singing of a drone accompaniment underneath the melody, are especially common in songs from the Shope region around the Bulgarian capital Sofia and the Pirin region (Bulgarian Macedonia). In addition to the ensemble led by Koutev, who adapted and arranged many of the harmonies, and composed several songs (as did his wife, Maria Kouteva) that were also performed by other groups, other women&#x27;s vocal groups gained popularity, including Trio Bulgarka, consisting of Yanka Rupkina, Eva Georgieva, and Stoyanka Boneva. Some of these groups were included in the &quot;Mystery of the Bulgarian Voices&quot; tours.

Trio Bulgarka were featured on &quot;The Sensual World&quot; album by Kate Bush on the songs &quot;Deeper Understanding&quot;, &quot;Never Be Mine&quot;, and &quot;Rocket&#x27;s Tail&quot;. In 1993 they appeared on another Kate Bush album, &quot;The Red Shoes&quot;, in the songs &quot;You&#x27;re the One&quot;, &quot;The Song of Solomon&quot;, and &quot;Why Should I Love You?&quot;, which also featured Prince.

===Asymmetric meters===


One of the most distinctive features of Bulgarian folk music is the complexity of its rhythms in comparison to Western music. Although it uses Western meters such as , , and , Bulgarian music also includes meters with odd numbers of beats per measure, sometimes called asymmetric meters. These can be understood as combinations of groups of &quot;quick&quot; and &quot;slow&quot; beats. For example, the dance &quot;lesnoto&quot; (&quot;the light/easy one&quot;) has a meter of seven beats with emphasis on the first, fourth, and sixth. This can be divided into three groups, a &quot;slow&quot; unit of three beats and two &quot;quick&quot; units of two beats, often written 3+2+2.

Each basic folk dance type uses a distinct combination of these rhythmic &quot;units&quot;.
Some examples of Bulgarian folk dances are &quot;rachenitsa&quot; (seven beats divided: 2+2+3), &quot;paydushko horo&quot; (five beats: 2+3), &quot;eleno mome&quot; (seven beats: 2+2+1+2), &quot;kopanitsa&quot; (eleven beats: 2+2+3+2+2), &quot;Bucimis&quot; (15 beats: 2+2+2+2+3+2+2), and &quot;pravo horo&quot;, which can either be standard or .

==Orthodox==
The tradition of church singing in Bulgaria is more than a thousand years old, and can be traced back to the early Middle Ages. One of the earliest known musical figures (composer, singer and musical reformer) of Medieval Europe John Kukuzel (1280–1360), known as The Angel-voiced for his singing abilities, has Bulgarian origins.

In the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, there are two traditions of church singing:

* Eastern monodic (one-voice) singing and choral (Polyphonic). The Eastern monodic singing observes the tradition of Greek and Byzantine music and the requirements of the eight-tones canon of the Eastern Orthodox chanting.
* The second tradition is rooted in choral church music, established during the 19th century, when Russian choral church music began to have an influence in Bulgaria. During the 19th and 20th century, many Bulgarian composers created their works in the spirit of Russian polyphony. Today, Orthodox music is alive and is performed both during church worship services and at concerts by secular choirs and soloists.

The following list shows contemporary Bulgarian choirs and singers that have a repertoire rooted in orthodox music:
* St. Alexandar Nevsky Cathedral Choir
* &quot;Madrigal&quot; Chamber Choir

===Chalga===

Chalga (pop-folk) is a contemporary music style that combines often provocative Bulgarian lyrics with popular Eastern European (rarely Russian and Ukrainian) and Turkish music. It is the Bulgarian version of the corresponding variations in neighbouring countries such as Greece (&quot;Laïkó&quot;), Serbia (&quot;Turbofolk&quot;) or Romania (&quot;manele&quot;).

This subgenre is rather a mixture of synthpop and gypsy music with Bulgarian wedding motives. Yuri Yunakov, a Bulgarian Romani saxophonist, is one of its creators with clarinetist Ivo Papazov. The album &quot;New Colors in Bulgarian Wedding Music&quot; highlights his amalgamation of traditional Bulgarian music with more modern elements.

During the Communist era, some folk musicians lived outside the state-supported music scene. Without official support, wedding bands were also without official limitations on their music, leading to fusions with foreign styles and instruments. Thrace was an important center of this music, which was entirely underground until 1986, when a festival of this music, which became a biennial event, was inaugurated in the town of Stambolovo, and artists like Sever, Trakiîski Solisti, Shoumen and Juzhni Vetar became popular, especially clarinetist Ivo Papasov.

<text>Creative Artists Agency, LLC (CAA) is an American talent and sports agency based in Los Angeles, California. With 1,800 employees in March 2016, it is regarded as an influential company in the talent agency business and manages numerous clients.

In September 2023, French billionaire François-Henri Pinault completed the acquisition of a majority stake in CAA, in an agreement valued at 7 billion dollars. The purchase was made through his investment company, Groupe Artémis.

==History==
Creative Artists Agency (CAA) was formed by five agents at the William Morris Agency in 1975. At a dinner, Michael Ovitz, Michael S. Rosenfeld, Ronald Meyer, Rowland Perkins, and William Haber decided to create their own agency. The agents were fired by William Morris before they could obtain financing.

CAA was incorporated in Delaware and had a $35,000 line of credit and a $21,000 bank loan and rented a small Century City office. Within a week, they sold a game show called &quot;Rhyme and Reason&quot;, the &quot;Rich Little Show&quot;, and &quot;The Jackson 5ive&quot;. An early plan was to form a medium-sized full-service agency, share proceeds equally, and do without nameplates on doors or formal titles or individual client lists, with guidelines like &quot;be a team player&quot; and &quot;return phone calls promptly.&quot;

CAA used its writer clients to attract actors to the agency. Ovitz and CAA were the first to package films like TV shows. Representing numerous A-list actors and having about $90 million in annual bookings in the late 1970s, Ovitz led the agency to expand into the film business. By the mid-1990s, CAA had 550 employees, about 1,400 of Hollywood&#x27;s top talent, and $150 million in revenue. In the 1990s, CAA was owned mostly by several key agents, including Ovitz, Meyer, and Haber.

Ovitz was good at &quot;packaging talent for movies and TV projects&quot; and negotiating large deals between Japanese conglomerates, such as Sony and Matsushita, with Hollywood studios, such as Columbia/TriStar and MCA. Ovitz expanded the agency into advertising and telecommunications. In 1992, the Coca-Cola Company placed CAA in charge of much of its marketing campaign, to work alongside advertising agency McCann Erickson. In 1995, CAA was described as the industry&#x27;s most powerful agency.

In 1995, Ron Meyer was appointed as the head of MCA, and Ovitz left for Disney. After Ovitz and Meyer left, talent agent Jay Moloney took over the company but struggled with a drug addiction and left the agency soon afterward. After Ovitz, the agency was taken over by Richard Lovett, who was made the president, along with Kevin Huvane, Rob Light, Bryan Lourd, Rick Nicita, and David O&#x27;Connor as managing partners.

In 1996, several CAA agents defected to rival agency Endeavor, taking with them prominent directors and actors. The partners founded the &quot;CAA Foundation&quot; in 1996 to create positive social change by encouraging volunteerism, partnerships, and donations. In 2012, it worked with Insight Labs for education reform, and contributed to its &quot;School Is Not School&quot; reform effort.

CAA established CAA Marketing in 1998 to work with brands and clients for promotion purposes. CAA Marketing developed Chipotle&#x27;s &quot;Back to the Start&quot; video and created a marketing campaign for the Coca-Cola Company.

In 2003, it opened a New York City office to manage theater clients. CAA began expanding into sports in 2006. From 2005 to 2015, CAA developed greater fiscal discipline, with more emphasis on profits, possibly as the result of the influence of private equity firms. During these years, CAA doubled in size, from 750 to 1,500 employees. In 2010, new technological developments such as the digital distribution of movies put strains on the industry. There was pressure to diversify into television, publishing, concerts, and find other ways to grow. In that year, private equity firm TPG Capital invested $165 million with an additional $200 million in debt financing.
CAA began an expansion into sports in 2006, under the leadership of CEO Richard Lovett. A report in &quot;USA Today&quot; suggested that CAA&#x27;s development of its sports-related clientele was significant in 2007. A report in &quot;Nexus&quot; magazine in 2015 suggested that CAA was well-positioned to develop the E-Sports market. CAA puts together deals for sports stars such as writing their clients into fitness apps.

CAA&#x27;s agents scrambled to deal with a strike by the Screen Actors Guild in 2008. In 2010, TPG Capital gained a 35% interest in the agency and pledged $500 million for investments. The transaction enabled acquisitions in areas such as sports and overseas operations.

It later sold a controlling stake to TPG Capital in October 2014. In 2015, TPG Capital was reported to own 53% of CAA. CAA is co-owner with an investment bank.

CAA has diversified into different businesses such as sports marketers and leagues and digital commerce. In 2014, CAA has been undergoing a transformation from relying solely on booking talent, into engineering multimedia deals worldwide. To this end, CAA established CAA Ventures, a venture capital fund that has supported products such as the Whisper app.

The WGA, which in 2019 held a dispute between the top four Hollywood talent agencies (William Morris Endeavor, Creative Artists Agency, United Talent Agency and ICM Partners), on September 30, 2020, asked CAA to sell a majority stake in their Content company for reaching a deal, with CAA accepting their divestment on December 16, 2020 and selling the majority of it to a South Korean studio, JTBC.

In June 2022, nine months after it was announced that CAA would acquire ICM Partners, a deal valued at $750 million was reached between the agencies. - following the acquisition, about 425 ICM staffers and agents were slated to join CAA. In September 2023, French billionaire François-Henri Pinault agreed to buy a majority stake.

On January 20, 2025, former President Joe Biden moved back to Wilmington, Delaware, after his term ended. He later signed with talent agency CAA to represent him in public engagements. CAA previously represented him from 2017 to 2020.

In February 2025, former Vice President Kamala Harris signed with CAA for representation on speaking engagements and publishing. 

==Agents==
CAA has employed top sports agents such as Tom Condon, Jeff Berry, and Tory Dandy.

CAA president Richard Lovett is known for shunning media attention and keeping a low profile. Lovett took the job position at CAA in 1995, and he was described as a &quot;skillful agent&quot; with a &quot;trademark ever-ready smile&quot; adept at schmoozing and hobnobbing with colleagues and studio heads. Lovett was described in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; as being &quot;elegantly aggressive.&quot;

Top agencies frequently raid each other&#x27;s staff, and when key people defect to rivals, it makes news headlines and often leads to legal battles over breach-of-contract claims. When agents defect, the rivalry can quickly devolve into vicious battles played out in courtrooms and in the media. When key CAA clients Will Ferrell and Chris Pratt defected to rival United Talent Agency (UTA) in 2015, and were later followed by ten agents, it erupted into a full-frontal legal battle between the warring agencies. In the lawsuit, CAA accused UTA of conducting a &quot;lawless, midnight raid&quot; as part of an &quot;illegal and unethical conspiracy&quot; with agents deliberately delaying meetings with clients to divert business to UTA. In a bitter lawsuit and countersuit between CAA and UTA in 2015, which began after a slew of CAA&#x27;s agents departed for UTA, there were accusations of fraud, malicious untruths, lying, and a range of charges including a &quot;breach of duty of loyalty&quot; as well as &quot;conspiracy to breach fiduciary duty.&quot;

Rivalry is not limited to rank-and-file agents, but can take the form of public barbs by company CEOs. Grudges can last for years; for example, movie producer Jay Weston sued CAA in 1979 about the rights to a film, and years later, it was revealed that Weston was &quot;totally ostracized&quot; by the agency. In effect, CAA would do the minimally required legal tasks of passing along required offers but otherwise staying uninvolved.

Some agents have had a reputation in the public&#x27;s mind of living in a world of &quot;fast cars, rooftop bars and foul-mouthed, phone-throwing power brokers,&quot; according to an account in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

CAA agent Jay Moloney led a colorful yet self-destructive life. Moloney interned at CAA while studying at USC, became the right-hand man of Michael Ovitz, worked with clients such as Leonardo DiCaprio and made millions, dated actresses such as Jennifer Grey and Gina Gershon, and &quot;battled personal demons&quot; and became a &quot;slave to cocaine&quot;; Moloney committed suicide at age 35.

In 2004, the HBO production entitled &quot;Entourage&quot; was made about a fictional Hollywood agent named Ari Gold. According to one report, the fictional Ari Gold character may have been based on a hybrid between an &quot;even-keeled&quot; Creative Artists Agency agent named Jeff Jacobs and an &quot;abrasive &#x27;go-for-the-jugular&#x27;&quot; William Morris Endeavor agent named Ari Emanuel. The report suggested that images like these may contribute to the public perception of agents as foul-mouthed and aggressive bullies.

Perhaps because of its dominance in the industry, CAA agents have a reputation for being &quot;coldhearted Hollywood power brokers,&quot; according to one report in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. 

The agency has been accused of blacklisting people who did or said things that the agency did not want publicized; for example, Courtney Love said that she was &quot;eternally banned&quot; beginning 2005 by CAA after making a negative comment about Miramax producer Harvey Weinstein. Uma Thurman left CAA on November 22, 2017, the day before making an Instagram post addressing accusations against Harvey Weinstein.

==Industry information==
With many clients, agents charge a percentage fee based on monies that their clients make; one estimate was that CAA charges 10% of what its movie and television clients are paid.

CAA chiefs including Michael Ovitz, Ron Meyer and Bill Haber built the agency by packaging actors and directors with literary clients, but the scope of deal-making has widened in recent decades. For example, CAA crafted a deal between toy-maker Hasbro, DreamWorks and Paramount Pictures, along with numerous CAA writers and directors, to make the movie franchise &quot;Transformers&quot;. Sometimes deal-making entails creating new technology firms. CAA even manages deals with the estates of long-dead clients such as reggae musician Bob Marley, who died in 1981. CAA helped one former politician create an online career institute. CAA sold sponsorship rights for a baseball stadium in San Francisco.

While talent agencies can grow by making acquisitions, CAA has generally grown organically by bringing in new clients. The company divided its agents into two camps: traditional agents who manage the career tracks of 1,000 stars, and specialists in investment banking, consulting, advertising and digital media. The agency can use its more glamorous clients in film and TV to craft deals with steadier income streams; for example, using clients such as Julia Roberts, they can assemble marketing programs for less glamorous clients, such as Nationwide Insurance.

When Hollywood agents change firms, and take stars and talent with them, it can have major financial repercussions for the departing agency, and can lead to much confusion as lawyers pour over the fine print of numerous contracts.

To market themselves, talent agencies often cater exclusive parties following awards ceremonies such as the Golden Globes. In 2013, CAA threw a party at the Sundance Film Festival which caused embarrassment and a public relations backlash, where &quot;guests mingled with lingerie-clad women pretending to snort prop cocaine, erotic dancers outfitted with sex toys and an Alice in Wonderland look-alike performing a simulated sex act on a man in a rabbit costume.&quot;

==Buildings==
In the late 1980s, CAA commissioned architect I. M. Pei to design a new headquarters building at the corner of Santa Monica and Wilshire Boulevards in Beverly Hills. The building consists of two curved wings set around a central atrium with a skylight that rises into a conical glass tower. The high atrium was designed as an art-filled formal reception hall with a 100-seat screening room and gourmet kitchen and displays a by mural by Roy Lichtenstein. The design used feng shui principles.

In 2007, CAA relocated to a new building in Century City, a district of Los Angeles. The new headquarters are sometimes referred to as &quot;The Death Star&quot; by entertainment professionals. CAA has offices in Los Angeles, New York, Nashville, London, Beijing, Atlanta, Miami, Chicago, Memphis, Stockholm, Munich and Switzerland.

In January 2022, CAA announced it would move its headquarters across the street from its existing office in 2026.

==Competition==
CAA was formed in 1975 from defections from the William Morris Agency, and there continue to be about four or five major talent agencies.

In 2009, William Morris Agency and Endeavor merged to form Endeavor Holdings. As of 2015, CAA and Endeavour are the largest agencies in the business. In 2014, Endeavour bought IMG Worldwide, a fashion and sports agency, for $2.4 billion. In 2014, Endeavour had 4500 employees while CAA had 1500 employees. Endeavour had a larger share of sports-related clients. The rivalry can get cantankerous: in one instance, Endeavour placed dozens of ads around the city using CAA&#x27;s red-and-white colour signature with the headline being CAAN&#x27;T, a &quot;playful nod to the CAA acronym.&quot; The agencies compete by &quot;regularly poaching agents and clients from one another.&quot;

==Controversies==
In December 2017, there were reports that the agency was actively involved in coverups relating to abuse and harassment by disgraced Miramax executive Harvey Weinstein. &quot;Variety&quot;, citing a report in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, reported that at least eight agents knew about the ongoing harassment yet continued to do business with Weinstein, and even sent actresses to meet with him in situations where they might have been vulnerable to his predations. Actress Uma Thurman accused the agency of being connected to Weinstein&#x27;s predatory behavior. In 2005, Courtney Love advised young actresses in an interview, &quot;If Harvey Weinstein invites you to a private party in the Four Seasons, don&#x27;t go.&quot; Love later said that she was &quot;banned&quot; by CAA for speaking out about Weinstein.

In October 2023, Maha Dakhil resigned from the agency’s internal board after making comments on social media critical of Israel during Israel-Hamas war. The post read, “You’re currently learning who supports genocide,” and she added her own caption: “That’s the line for me.” This was in reference to the CAA making a statement in support of Israel in an Instagram post.

<text>A video tape recorder (VTR) is a tape recorder designed to record and playback video and audio material from magnetic tape. The early VTRs were open-reel devices that record on individual reels of 2-inch-wide (5.08 cm) tape. They were used in television studios, serving as a replacement for motion picture film stock and making recording for television applications cheaper and quicker. Beginning in 1963, videotape machines made instant replay during televised sporting events possible. Improved formats, in which the tape was contained inside a videocassette, were introduced around 1969; the machines which play them are called videocassette recorders.

An agreement by Japanese manufacturers on a common standard recording format, which allowed cassettes recorded on one manufacturer&#x27;s machine to play on another&#x27;s, made a consumer market possible; and the first consumer videocassette recorder, which used the U-matic format, was introduced by Sony in 1971.

== History ==
In early 1951, Bing Crosby asked his Chief Engineer John T. (Jack) Mullin if television could be recorded on tape as was the case for audio. Mullin said that he thought that it could be done. Bing asked Ampex to build one and also set up a laboratory for Mullin in Bing Crosby Enterprises (BCE) to build one. In 1951 it was believed that if the tape was run at a very high speed it could provide the necessary bandwidth to record the video signal. The problem was that a video signal has a much wider bandwidth than an audio signal does (6 MHz vs 20 kHz), requiring extremely high tape speeds to record it. However, there was another problem: the magnetic head design would not permit bandwidths over 1 megahertz to be recorded regardless of the tape speed.

The first efforts at video recording, using recorders similar to audio recorders with fixed heads, were unsuccessful. The first such demonstration of this technique was done by BCE on 11 November 1951. The result was a very poor picture. Another of the early efforts was the Vision Electronic Recording Apparatus, a high-speed multi-track machine developed by the BBC in 1952. This machine used a thin steel tape on a 21-inch (53.5 cm) reel traveling at over 200 inches (510 cm) per second. Despite 10 years of research and improvements, it was never widely used due to the immense length of tape required for each minute of recorded video.

By 1952 BCE also had moved on to multi-track machines, but found limitations in recording bandwidth even at the high speeds. In 1953 BCE discovered that the magnetic head design was the problem. This problem was corrected and bandwidths exceeding the 1 megahertz limit were able to be recorded. Since BCE and AMPEX were working together on the video recorder the new head design was shared with them, and AMPEX used it in their recorder. In 1955 BCE demonstrated a broadcast-quality color recorder that operated at 100 inches per second and CBS ordered three of them. Many other fixed-head recording systems were tried but all required an impractically high tape speed. It became clear that practical video recording technology depended on finding some way of recording the wide-bandwidth video signal without the high tape speed required by linear-scan machines.

In 1953 Eduard Schüller of Telefunken patented the helical scan technology. Another solution was transverse-scan technology, developed by Ampex around 1954, in which the recording heads are mounted on a spinning drum and record tracks in the transverse direction, across the tape. By recording on the full width of the tape rather than just a narrow track down the center, this technique achieved a much higher density of data per linear centimeter of tape, allowing a lower tape speed of 15 inches per second to be used. The Ampex VRX-1000 became the world&#x27;s first commercially successful videotape recorder in 1956. It uses the 2″ quadruplex format, using two-inch (5.1 cm) tape. Because of its price, the Ampex VRX-1000 could be afforded only by the television networks and the largest individual stations.

By early 1957 the only successful manufacturer of videotape was 3M, the product being exceedingly difficult to manufacture to the necessary quality. The three U.S. networks officially inaugurated use of videotape on 28 April 1957, &quot;with the changeover to daylight saving time,&quot; at which time there were &quot;probably not more than 50 useable rolls of tape among them—it was that critical.&quot;

Ampex&#x27;s quadruplex magnetic tape video recording system has certain limitations, such as the lack of clean pause, or still-frame, capability, because when tape motion is stopped, only a single segment of the picture recording is present at the playback heads (only 16 lines of the picture in each segment), so it can only reproduce recognizable pictures when the tape is playing at normal speed.) But in spite of its drawbacks it remained the broadcasting studio standard until about 1980. The helical scan system overcame this limitation.

In 1959 JVC demonstrated its first helical scan VTR named KV-1. In 1963, Philips introduced its EL3400 1&quot; helical scan recorder (aimed at the business and domestic user), and Sony marketed the 2&quot; PV-100, its first open-reel VTR intended for business, medical, airline, and educational use.

The Telcan, produced by the Nottingham Electronic Valve Company and demonstrated on June 24, 1963, was the first home video recorder. It could be bought as a unit or in kit form for £60. However, there were several drawbacks: it was expensive, not easy to put together, and can record for only 20 minutes at a time in black-and-white.

The Sony model CV-2000, first marketed in 1965, is their first VTR intended for home use and is based on half-inch tape. Ampex and RCA followed in 1965 with their own open-reel monochrome VTRs priced under US $1,000 for the home consumer market. Prerecorded videos for home replay became available in 1967.

The EIAJ format is a standard half-inch format used by various manufacturers. EIAJ-1 is an open-reel format. EIAJ-2 uses a cartridge that contains a supply reel, but not the take-up reel. Since the take-up reel is part of the recorder, the tape has to be fully rewound before removing the cartridge, which is a relatively slow procedure.

The development of the videocassette followed other replacements of open-reel systems with a cassette or cartridge in consumer items: the Stereo-Pak 4-track audio cartridge in 1962, the compact audio cassette and Instamatic film cartridge in 1963, the 8-track cartridge in 1965, and the Super 8 home motion picture film cartridge in 1966.
Before the invention of the video tape recorder, live video was recorded onto motion picture film stock in a process known as telerecording or kinescoping. Although the first quadruplex VTRs recorded with good quality, the recordings could not be slowed or freeze-framed, so kinescoping processes continued to be used for about a decade after the development of the first VTRs.

==Technology==

In the technique used in all transverse-scan video tape recorders, the recording heads are mounted in a rapidly spinning drum which is pressed against the moving tape, so the heads move across the tape in a transverse or nearly vertical path, recording the video signal in consecutive parallel tracks sideways across the tape. This allows use of the entire width of the tape, storing much more data per inch of tape, compared to the fixed head used in audio tape recording, which records a single track down the tape. The heads move across the tape at the high speed necessary to record the high-bandwidth video signal, but the tape moves at a slower speed through the machine. In addition, three ordinary tracks are recorded along the edge of the tape by stationary recording heads. For correct playback, the motion of the heads has to be precisely synchronized with the motion of the tape through the capstan, so a control track of synchronizing pulses is recorded. The other two tracks are for the audio channel and a cueing track.

The early machines use the Ampex 2-inch quadruplex system in which the drum has 4 heads and rotates at 14,400 RPM perpendicular to the tape, so the recorded tracks are transverse to the tape axis. With 2-inch tape this requires 16 tracks for a single analog NTSC video frame or 20 for a PAL frame.

The helical scan methods use a recording drum with a diagonal axis of rotation. The tape is wrapped longitudinally around the drum by idler wheels, so the tape heads, instead of moving across the tape at almost 90° to the direction of motion as in the quadruplex system, move across the tape at a shallow angle, recording a long diagonal track across the tape. This allows an entire frame to be recorded per track. This simplifies the electronics and timing systems. It also allows the recorder to be paused (freeze-framed) during playback to display a single still frame, by simply stopping the tape transport mechanism, allowing the tape heads to repeatedly pass over the same track.

This recording technique has many potential sources of timing errors. If the mechanism runs at an absolutely constant speed, and never varies from moment to moment, or from the time of recording to the time of playback, then the timing of the playback signal is exactly the same as the input. However, imperfection being inevitable, the timing of the playback always differs to some extent from the original signal. Longitudinal error (error arising from effects in the long direction of the tape) can be caused by variations in the rotational rate of the capstan drive, stretching of the tape medium, and jamming of tape in the machine. Transverse error (error arising from effects in the cross-tape direction) can be caused by variations in the rotational speed of the scanning drum and differences in the angle between the tape and the scanning heads (usually addressed by video tracking controls). Longitudinal errors are similar to the ones that cause wow and flutter in audio recordings. Since these errors are not so subtle and since it is standard video recording practice to record a parallel control track, these errors are detected and servomechanisms are adjusted accordingly to dramatically reduce this problem.

== VCR ==

Many of the deficiencies of the open-reel systems were overcome with the invention of the videocassette recorder (VCR), where the videotape is enclosed in a user-friendly videocassette shell. This subsequently became the most familiar type of VTR known to consumers. In this system, the tape is preattached onto two reels enclosed within the cassette, and tape loading and unloading are automated. There is no need for the user to ever touch the tape, and the media can be protected from dust, dirt, and tape misalignments that can foul the recording mechanism. Typically, the only time the user ever touches the tape in a videocassette is when a failure results from a tape getting stuck in the mechanism.

Home VCRs first became available in the early 1970s, with Sony releasing its VO-1600 model in 1971 and with Philips releasing the Model 1500 in England a year later. The first system to be notably successful with consumers was Sony&#x27;s Betamax (or Beta) in 1975. It was soon followed by the competing VHS (Video Home System) format from JVC in 1977 and later by other formats such as Video 2000 from Philips, V-Cord from Sanyo, and Great Time Machine from Quasar.

The Beta/VHS format war soon began, while the other competitors quickly disappeared. Betamax sales eventually began to dwindle, and after several years VHS emerged as the winner of the format war. In 1988, Sony began to market its own VHS machines, and despite claims that it was still backing Beta, it was clear that the format was no longer viable in most parts of the world. In parts of South America and in Japan, Betamax continued to be popular and was still in production up to the end of 2002.

Later developments saw analog magnetic tapes largely replaced by digital video tape formats. Following this, much of the VTR market, in particular videocassettes and VCRs popular at the consumer level, were also replaced by non-tape media, such as DVD and later Blu-ray optical discs.

<text>Language policy is both an interdisciplinary academic field and implementation of ideas about language use.
Some scholars such as Joshua Fishman and Ofelia García consider it as part of sociolinguistics. On the other hand, other scholars such as Bernard Spolsky, Robert B. Kaplan and Joseph Lo Bianco argue that language policy is a branch of applied linguistics.

As a field, language policy is also known as language planning or language policy and planning, and is related to other fields such as language ideology, language revitalization, and language education, among others.

== Definitions ==
Language policy has been defined in a number of ways. According to Kaplan and Baldauf (1997), &quot;A language policy is a body of ideas, laws, regulations, rules and practices intended to achieve the planned language change in the societies, group or system&quot; (p. xi). 
Lo Bianco defines the field as &quot;a situated activity, whose specific history and local circumstances influence what is regarded as a language problem, and whose political dynamics determine which language problems are given policy treatment” (p. 152).
McCarty (2011) defines language policy as &quot;a complex sociocultural process [and as] modes of human interaction, negotiation, and production mediated by relations of power. The &#x27;policy&#x27; in these processes resides in their language-regulating power; that is, the ways in which they express normative claims about legitimate and illegitimate language forms and uses, thereby governing language statuses and uses&quot; (p. 8). 

== Overview ==
Language policy is broad, but it can be categorized into three components. Spolsky (2004) argues, &quot;A useful first step is to distinguish between the three components of the language policy of a speech community: (1) its language practices – the habitual pattern of selecting among the varieties that make up its linguistic repertoire; (2) its language beliefs or ideology – the beliefs about language and language use; and (3) any specific efforts to modify or influence that practice by any kind of language intervention, planning, or management&quot; (p. 5).

The traditional scope of language policy concerns language regulation. This refers to what a government does either officially through legislation, court decisions or policy to determine how languages are used, cultivate language skills needed to meet national priorities or to establish the rights of individuals or groups to use and maintain languages.

== Implementation ==
The implementation of language policy varies from one state to another. This may be explained by the fact that language policy is often based on contingent historical reasons. Likewise, states also differ as to the degree of explicitness with which they implement a given language policy. The French Toubon law provides a good example of explicit language policy. The same may be said for the Charter of the French Language in Quebec.

Scholars such as Tollefson argue that language policy can create inequality: &quot;language planning-policy means the institutionalization of language as a basis for distinctions among social groups (classes). That is, language policy is one mechanism for locating language within social structure so that language determines who has access to political power and economic resources. Language policy is one mechanism by which dominant groups establish hegemony in language use&quot; (p. 16).

Many countries have a language policy designed to favor or discourage the use of a particular language or set of languages. States, local authorities or pressure-groups can promote bilingual signage or can agitate for translations of newspaper articles.
Although nations historically have used language policies most often to promote one official language at the expense of others, many countries now have policies designed to protect and promote regional and ethnic languages whose viability is threatened. Indeed, whilst the existence of linguistic minorities within a jurisdiction has often been considered to be a potential threat to internal cohesion, states also understand that providing language rights to minorities may be more in their long-term interest, as a means of gaining citizens&#x27; trust in the central government.

The preservation of cultural and linguistic diversity in today&#x27;s world is a major concern to many scientists, artists, writers, politicians, leaders of linguistic communities, and defenders of linguistic human rights. More than half of the 6000 languages currently spoken in the world are estimated to be in danger of disappearing during the 21st century. Many factors affect the existence and usage of any given human language, including the size of the population of native speakers, its use in formal communication, and the geographical dispersion and the socio-economic weight of its speakers. National language policies can either mitigate or exacerbate the effects of some of these factors.

For example, according to Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann: &quot;Native tongue title and language rights should be promoted. The government ought to define Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander vernaculars as official languages of Australia. We must change the linguistic landscape of Whyalla and elsewhere. Signs should be in both English and the local indigenous language. We ought to acknowledge intellectual property of indigenous knowledge including language, music and dance.&quot;

There are many ways in which language policies can be categorized. Université Laval sociolinguist Jacques Leclerc elaborated the field for the French-language web site (put on line by the CIRAL in 1999). The collecting, translating and classifying of language policies started in 1988 and culminated in the publishing of (vol. I to VI) at Presses de l&#x27;Université Laval in 1994. The work, containing some 470 language-laws, and the research leading to publication, were subsidised by the Office québécois de la langue française. In April 2008, the web site presented the linguistic portrait and language policies in 354 States or autonomous territories in 194 recognised countries.

<text>A conditional baptism is a baptism performed in such a way as to only be effective if the person is not already baptized. In a conditional baptism, the minister of the sacrament says:

==Rationale==

Mainline Christian theology (including Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Church of the East, Anglican, Lutheran and most other Protestants) has traditionally held that only one baptism is valid to confer the benefits of this sacrament. The Council of Trent defined a dogma that it is forbidden to baptize a person who is already baptized, because the first baptism would make an indelible mark on the soul. Likewise, &quot;Methodist theologians argued that since God never abrogated a covenant made and sealed with proper intentionality, rebaptism was never an option, unless the original baptism had been defective by not having been made in the name of the Trinity.&quot;

Therefore, in cases where the validity of a baptism is in doubt, a conditional baptism may be performed. There exist other conditional sacraments.

Such uncertainty may result from questions about whether the Triune name of God was used by the person administering the baptism. In some cases, there are doubts about whether a church from which someone is converting baptizes in a valid manner. It is an issue where an infant is a foundling, and it is not known whether the child had been baptized before abandonment. Another example of a case requiring conditional baptism is when an emergency baptism has been performed using impure water. Then, the validity of the baptism is in question. In that case, a conditional baptism is later performed by an ordinary minister of the sacrament with certainly valid matter.

In a typical baptism, the minister of the sacrament (in the Catholic Church usually a deacon or a priest, but sometimes, especially when the baptized is in imminent danger of death, a lay person) says &quot;I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&quot; while pouring water upon the head of the one being baptized, or immersing him or her in water. A conditional baptism simply adds the words &quot;if you are not yet baptized&quot;.

==Other cases==

Only the living can be recipients of Sacraments. Thus, if it is uncertain whether the baptizand is dead (&quot;i.e.&quot;, their soul has parted from the body; this is the case for the first few hours or so after death in the modern sense), the formula is &quot;If you are alive, I baptize [...]&quot;. In severe cases of birth anomaly, the (practically, always emergency) baptism formula is &quot;If you are a human being, I baptize [...]&quot;.

Likewise, if an emergency baptism has been performed over a part of the body other than the head (practically: during birth), or on a pregnant woman&#x27;s womb (for the unborn child), the child is to be conditionally rebaptized (with the usual &quot;if you are not baptized&quot;) even though the emergency baptisms should be performed in this way if necessary.

<text>The Opel Astra is a compact car/small family car (C-segment) developed and produced by the German automaker Opel since 1991, currently at its sixth generation. It was first launched in September 1991 as a direct replacement to the Opel Kadett. , the car slots between the smaller Corsa supermini and the larger Frontera subcompact crossover suv.

Initially, the Astra was available in hatchback, saloon, and estate (station wagon; known as the Astra Caravan, later the Sports Tourer) forms. A panel van (sedan delivery; Astravan) and a convertible (Astra Cabrio) also appeared in the early 1990s. These body styles were later followed by a coupé (the Astra GTC) in 2004, and the sporty Astra OPC appeared in 2005. The Twin Top retractable hardtop convertible replaced the soft top convertible in 2006, while the Caravan was renamed to Astra Sports Tourer since 2009.

The Astra is branded the Vauxhall Astra in the United Kingdom. It was rebadged and sold as the Saturn Astra in North America between 2008 and 2009, as the Buick Excelle XT from 2009 until 2015 and as the Buick Verano/Hatchback GS in China from 2015 until 2021. The Holden Astra was discontinued in Australia and New Zealand in 2009, and was replaced by the locally assembled Holden Cruze. It briefly returned to the Australian market in 2012, for the first time badged as an Opel, but was discontinued after Opel withdrew from the country a year later. In 2015, Opel reintroduced the Astra GTC and Astra VXR to Australia and New Zealand in 2015, again bearing the Holden badge. Between 2017 and 2019, the Astra nameplate was also used for the Holden version of the Cruze sedan.

After Opel was sold by General Motors to PSA Group, the Astra K continued to be produced under license until it was replaced by the Astra L. The Astra L was released after the merger of the company to form Stellantis.

The Astra nameplate originates from Vauxhall, which had manufactured and marketed earlier generations of the Opel Kadett (the Kadett D and Kadett E) as the Vauxhall Astra since March 1980. Subsequent GM Europe policy standardised model nomenclature in the early 1990s, whereby model names were the same in all markets regardless of the marque they were sold under.

As of 2021, there have been six generations of the Astra (or eleven generations of the Kadett/Astra family as a whole). In a fashion typical for Opel, they are designated with subsequent letters of the Latin alphabet. Opel&#x27;s official convention is that the Astra is a logical continuation of the Kadett lineage, thus, the first generation of Opel Astra became the &quot;Astra F&quot; rather than the Astra A since the final Opel Kadett was the Kadett E. The Mk1 and Mk2 Vauxhall Astras are sometimes called the &quot;Astra D&quot; and &quot;Astra E&quot; by enthusiasts to mark the continuity with their sister models.

Models sold as Vauxhall, Holden, or Chevrolet have different generation designations reflecting the history of those nameplates in their home markets and their naming conventions.

== First generation (Astra F – T91; 1991) ==
The Astra F debuted in September 1991. With the Kadett E&#x27;s successor, Opel adopted the Astra nameplate, which was already used by Vauxhall for the Kadett D and E (see Vauxhall Astra). It was offered as a three- or five-door hatchback, a saloon (sedan), and an estate (wagon) known as the Caravan and available with five doors only, bringing Opel&#x27;s run of three-door wagons to an end at long last. The Caravan appeared in October 1991, immediately after the original introduction, as did the sporty, 16-valve GSI model with its aggressive bodykit. A cabriolet was also offered, designed, and built by Bertone in Italy.

Compared to the Kadett, the Astra grew slightly in all dimensions except the wheelbase. The windshield was moved forward by while the roof was extended the same amount at the rear, meaning a significant increase in interior volume.

The Astra F received a cosmetic facelift in the of 1994, accompanied by improved rust protection. This included a new grille with a larger Opel badge, clear front turn signals, new door mirrors (replacing the earlier Kadett E units used on the pre-facelift model), and a generally smoothed-out appearance. While the Astra F finished production in Germany in 2000, Polish-built Astras remained on offer in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Turkey, India and Asia with the name Opel Astra Classic from 1999 to 2003.

The Astra F consisted of two main revisions and was revised in 1995, with the launch of Opel&#x27;s new Ecotec engine.

Aside from the South Africa-only 200tS, the lead model was the GSi – a 2.0-litre 16V fuel injected model with , available as a three-door only. It also featured a sports body kit and widened front seats in the interior. However, this was substituted in 1995 and was renamed as &quot;SPORT&quot;, although only a limited number were produced and the body kit was removed also and it could be selected with the lower-powered, but more modern &#x27;Ecotec&#x27; version, the X20XEV parallel with the C20XE. In Europe from 1994 all Astra models were offered with the 2.0 L 16V Ecotec X20XEV parallel with the eight-valve C20NE engine, but the three-door and station wagon models could be selected with the C20XE engine.

After the Astra F was replaced by the new generation Astra G in 1998, the so-called &quot;REDTOP&quot; C20XE engine was also taken out of production.

===South African models===
The model was also launched in South Africa in November 1991, where it was produced under licence by Delta. The &quot;Kadett&quot; name was retained for the hatchback Astras until 2000. The sedan and station wagon models were offered under the Astra name. The Kadett and Astra in South Africa won the title of &#x27;Car of the Year&#x27; in two consecutive years (1994 and 1995) even though they were versions of the same car. South African nomenclature was denoted in centilitres, so the Astra and Kadett ranges featured 140, 160i, 180i and 200i models. Models with fuel injection received the &quot;i&quot; designation, while carburetor models didn&#x27;t. Additional model designation was listed after the displacement with the inclusion of the letters &quot;S&quot; for sport or &quot;E&quot; for executive. Sport trim was typically for the Kadett (hatchback) model and included a different front bumper with spotlights and a rear spoiler. Executive derivatives included a higher specification level than non-executive models. The top variant in the Kadett (hatchback) model was the 200iS which featured a 2.0 SOHC 8v engine producing 95kw while the top spec Astra (sedan) derivative featured a 2.0 16v DOHC engine producing 110kw. The South African lineup also included a unique limited edition variant with a turbocharged C20LET engine called the 200tS offered in either Kadett (hatchback) or Astra (sedan) derivatives and was only available for two model years (1994-1995) and in limited numbers. The 200tS was built by Delta Motor Corporation and faster than the then-current BMW M3 in a quarter-mile drag race. The &quot;t&quot; stands for the turbocharger. The engine was sourced from the 4x4 Opel Calibra and Opel Vectra and converted from a six-speed, four-wheel drive transmission (Getrag F28) to front-wheel drive only with a limited slip differential. The 200tS was unique from other Kadett and Astra models as it used a 5 bolt wheel hub (all other cars used a 4 bolt hub), it also featured unique 16&quot; alloy wheels only available on the 200tS.

===Other markets===
The Opel Astra also became available in Australasia badged as a Holden, first in New Zealand in 1995, and then Australia in 1996. These models were imported from the UK. The Holden Astra name had previously been used on rebadged Nissan Pulsar models from 1984 to 1989.

The Opel Astra&#x27;s first generation was exported to Brazil from December 1994 as the Chevrolet Astra, possibly because of a lowering of import tariffs. General Motors do Brasil sent the 2.0-litre, 115 bhp engines to Belgium, whence the completed cars took their way to Brazil. In February 1996 the Brazilian government again changed the import tariff, from 20 to 70% - making the car prohibitively expensive and leading to its cancellation after just over a year on the market. Instead, the locally built Kadett was updated. The second-generation Astra was manufactured in Brazil.

Beginning in March 1995, the Astra sedan was assembled in Indonesia where it was marketed as the Opel Optima. The renaming was done as the global name was already used by Astra International, a local automotive company and an assembler/distributor of several competing car brands. In India the Opel Astra was assembled for the local market in a joint venture with the Birla Companies, beginning in 1996. Indian production ended in 2002.

The first-generation Chevrolet Astra in Brazil had a Vauxhall-style front grille featuring a &quot;V&quot;, containing the Chevrolet badge.

== Second generation (Astra G – T98; 1998) ==
The Astra G was launched in Europe in Spring of 1998. It was available as a three or five-door hatchback, four-door saloon, five-door estate (in Opel tradition, known as a &quot;Caravan&quot;) and two special versions from 2000: the Astra Coupé and the Astra Cabrio, both of them designed and built by Bertone. The Astra G saw the introduction of a natural gas-powered engine. Its chassis was tuned by Lotus and formed the base of a 7-seater compact MPV, the Opel Zafira, which was co-developed by Porsche. Approximately 90,000 coupés were produced.

The manufacturing of the Astra saloon and Caravan continued at Opel&#x27;s Gliwice plant in Poland after the debut of the next-generation Astra H, with the older model being branded as Astra Classic in a similar fashion to its predecessor, catering to the lower end of the market. This car was offered in Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Turkey with the name Astra Classic II from 2004 to the end of 2009. Apart from European markets, these models were also sold in Australia and New Zealand as the Holden Astra Classic, until they were replaced by the Holden Viva (built-in South Korea) in 2006.

The Astra G was built as Chevrolet Astra in Brazil. It was facelifted in 2003 and was sold in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and other Latin American markets until 2011. The GM Brazilian 2.0 8V inline-four engine which equips the Astra has the &quot;flex-power&quot; technology, that allows the car to run on both petrol and alcohol fuels, providing 128/140 hp (G/A) at 5200 rpm.

A taxi version of the Brazilian sourced model, powered with petrol 2.0-litre engine was sold in Chile as the Chevy Urban.

In 2004, GM&#x27;s Russian joint venture GM-AvtoVAZ launched the 4-door version of the Astra G as the Chevrolet Viva. It was sold through Chevrolet dealers in Russia, while Opel dealers were selling the newer Opel Astra H. Sales were poor from the start due to high pricing: the only version launched was equipped with a 1.8L engine with an above-average trim level, placing the Viva&#x27;s price above the Toyota Corolla. A project costing $340 million was selling less than a thousand cars annually (801 cars in 2007); rumours of shutting down Chevy Viva production circulated as early as summer of 2005. GM-AvtoVAZ shut down small-scale production of the Viva in March 2008.

===V8 Coupe in DTM===
The Astra G series Coupé was used for the silhouette racing cars in the DTM series. These DTM racing cars are purpose-built race cars with barely any parts taken from the road cars except for lights and door handles. The car&#x27;s bodywork featured gull-wing doors that were each supported by two gas struts. The racing cars were powered by 4.0L V8 engines with nearly . Opel did poorly during several seasons of DTM as only Manuel Reuter placed significantly in the championship once, taking second in the inaugural season in 2000 before withdrawing at the end of 2005, but the car was also used to win the 24h Nürburgring in 2003.

===Xtreme===
The Astra Xtreme, a concept car presented at the 2001 Geneva motor show, was a single-production V8-powered Astra based on the G-series Astra DTM. Like the DTM racing car, it featured a V8 engine, producing , gull-wing doors supported by gas struts, carbon fibre panels, and race-specification interior with five-point seatbelts.

===Stock Car Brazil===
The season of 2005 also joined the history of Stock Car. In addition to the category becoming multi - the first time the Mitsubishi Lancer ran alongside the Chevrolet Astra, on 30 October 2005, 40 cars with Stock Car V8 engines performed an unprecedented race outside of Brazil worth points for the championship. It was a round to the side of TC 2000, the main category of Argentina and in July had run in Curitiba (Autodromo Internacional de Curitiba). The Autódromo Juan y Oscar Gálvez got a crowd of 70,000 people. Giuliano Losacco was the winner, with Mateus Greipel second and Luciano Burti third.

The engine was a V8 Chevrolet 350 imported from the United States by JL, similar to that used in Busch Series, the second category of NASCAR, equal and limited to . The automaker GM was now sponsoring the category, providing the fairing of the Astra, making room for other manufacturers to enter the category with a low investment.

== Third generation (Astra H – A04; 2004) ==
The Astra H was launched in March 2004 as a five-door hatchback, whilst a five-door estate launched late 2004 and a sporty three-door hatchback, designated the GTC (Gran Tourismo Compact) for European markets, Sport Hatch in the UK and the Coupé in Australia, launched in 2005. The GTC has the option of a windscreen called &quot;panoramic windscreen&quot; (unique for a production car at the time of its launch) which extends into the roof area. Based on an updated version of GM&#x27;s T platform, its size was increased compared to the previous version. Production came until the end of 2009, excepting the TwinTop which continued to be manufactured until November 2010.

The ageing Vectra B was replaced in Brazil with a sedan version of the Astra H, named Chevrolet Vectra, until it was replaced by the Chevrolet Cruze in 2009, though the sedan version of the Vectra continued to be sold alongside the Cruze until 2011 when the Cruze fully replaced it. The model was matched with the other models offered in Brazil. This version was offered as an Opel in some Eurasian markets in 2006, following a debut at the international auto show in Istanbul, Turkey, including Ireland in 2008. This was manufactured in Gliwice, Poland. Also in 2006, the Astravan, a 3-door van variant of the estate, was launched. In September 2007, a version of the 5-door Astra was launched in Brazil, marketed as Chevrolet Vectra GT to differentiate from the already existing Astra, which was replaced by the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback in 2011.

The Opel Astra was revised in January 2007, with the introduction of different colours of the posterior lighthouses and a new front.

GM Russia launched SKD assembly of Astra on a temporary production site near Saint Petersburg in February 2008, with a potential capacity of 25,000 vehicles annually.

The Chevrolet Astra was withdrawn from Mexico in 2008 as a result of the withdrawal of Opel products from the brand, replaced by the Chevrolet Cruze sedan for the 2010 model year.

A first for any major European car is the availability of digital radio on some versions of the new Astra, while for the Astra product class first are electronically controlled chassis (IDS+) and AFL (Adaptive Forward Lighting).

This generation was kept in production in Bochum alongside the new Astra J and sold as the Opel Astra Classic III in some Eastern European markets such as Poland and Turkey. It was available as a 5-door hatchback, saloon, and estate. Production of the Opel Astra Classic III eventually ended in 2014.

At the end of 2012, the Astravan was replaced by the new Opel Combo D (where the production of the Astra H had already ended).

===Pre-facelift===
=== Facelift ===
===OPC===
During 2005, Opel introduced the OPC version of the Astra GTC (sold as the Astra VXR in the UK) which is powered by an updated version of the 2.0 L turbo Family II engine (Z20 LEH) producing 240 PS (177 kW, 237 bhp) and of torque. Standard features of the OPC version include sports bodykit and recaro interior, a six-speed manual gearbox, xenon headlamps and 18-inch alloy wheels amongst others.

This vehicle was sold until late 2009 in Australia and New Zealand by Holden Special Vehicles as the HSV VXR. HSV VXRs but it never offered a sedan in the UK and Australia are sold as standard with full leather trim, climate control, 6 disc CD and 19-inch alloy wheels. HSV VXRs were badged as per the UK Vauxhall Spec models but without the usual rear boot badge. The sedan was discontinued in Australia and United Kingdom in 2007. Inside the Opel Blitz appears on the steering wheel with an OPC dashboard. The Astra OPC was also sold as the Chevrolet Astra OPC in Chile.

====Gallery====
===TwinTop===
In 2006, the Astra TwinTop arrived. (The &quot;TwinTop&quot; name also applies to the smaller Tigra and refers to a retractable hardtop convertible version of the car, shared with the Pontiac G6.) The Astra TwinTop has a three-part folding metal roof which sits in the upper half of the boot space, leaving considerable luggage space below it. Still marketed as a four-seater, the rear seating space is smaller than other Astra models. The TwinTop was available in three trim levels with a range of engines in each, including a 2.0 L turbo and the 1.9 CDTI diesel in form.

Launched in January 2007, Australian-market TwinTops came with the Z22YH 2.2 L direct-injection engine with a choice of 6-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission which was unique to Australia.

The folding roof assembly was built by Magna Steyr&#x27;s Car Top Systems (CTS) subsidiary in Antwerp, Belgium, near the plant where the TwinTop was assembled. The TwinTop was discontinued in November 2010 along with the 3-door GTC, both replaced by the soft-top Opel Cascada.

===Stock Car Brazil===
In Brazil, Chevrolet Vectra (Astra H) substituted the Chevrolet Astra on Stock Car. The V8 is still the same, apart from that now they use Ethanol instead of Petrol.

===Saturn Astra===
The Saturn Astra was marketed in North America both the U.S and Canada after debuting at the 2007 Chicago Auto Show. Superseding the Ion, the Astra was a captive import, based on the Opel Astra, manufactured in Antwerp, Belgium.

Available in three and five-door hatchback body styles, sales began on 2 January 2008 with a single engine, a 1.8 L U18XER inline-4-cylinder petrol engine with variable-valve technology producing — available five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed automatic transmission.

The XE base trim level was offered on the five-door hatchback and included steel wheels with plastic covers. The XR trim level was the only trim level for the 3-door and was available on five-door models — and included enhanced seat bolsters, driver lumbar and seat height adjusters; 17-inch alloy ten-spoke wheels and P225/45R17 all-season performance tires; easy Entry front sliding seats (3 door model) and enhanced instrument gauges.

Standard equipment included air conditioning (XR trim); cruise control; driver information centre including audio, time and outside temperature display; power door locks with central locking feature and remote keyless entry; courtesy lighting and dual reading lamps in front and rear; cloth front bucket reclining seats with adjustable active head restraints; easy entry front sliding seats (3 door); rear 60/40-split flat-folding seat with adjustable and removable head restraints and retractable; dual cupholders, driver 4-way and passenger 2-way manually adjustable seats; three-spoke steering wheel with rake and telescoping steering column; steering wheel-mounted audio and Driver Information Center controls; overhead sunglass storage; front seat illuminated vanity mirrors; power windows with express-Down; front console with cupholder and 12-volt power outlet; power-adjustable, manual folding, heated side mirrors; and rain sensing front intermittent windshield wipers.

An optional &quot;Premium Trim Package&quot; for XR models included leather seating surfaces, vinyl door trim, leather-wrapped steering wheel, driver manual lumbar seat adjuster, heated front seats, and interior ambient LED lighting. For 2008, an optional &quot;Sport Handling Package&quot; included stability control (marketed as StabiliTrak), lowered sport suspension, and quick-ratio power steering. This package was made standard on the 2009 3-door. A panoramic sunroof was available on 5-door models.

In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash tests the Astra earned a &quot;Good&quot; overall score in frontal impacts, while in side impacts it received a &quot;Marginal&quot; overall rating. Front and rear head curtain airbags and front seat-mounted torso airbags were standard, along with a system marketed as the &quot;Pedal Release System,&quot; whereby the clutch and or brake pedal would decouple in the event of a frontal crash with significant cowl intrusion, mitigating lower leg injury. 

General Motors predicted sales of between 30,000 and 40,000 vehicles a year in the United States. Sales were slow, due initially to a large glut of unsold Ions and later the uncertainty surrounding the Saturn brand&#x27;s future. In 2008 only 11,968 were sold in the US and in 2009 this fell to 6,298. In Canada the sales of the Saturn Astra was up to 11,605 in total between 2007 and 2010.

With a large number of unsold cars remaining on dealer lots, GM announced it would end import of the Astra. In June 2009, GM announced its intention to sell the Saturn Corporation to Penske Automotive Group. This never was concluded and in 2010 General Motors discontinued the Saturn brand.

The successor to the Saturn Astra in the North American General Motors lineup was the Buick Verano, introduced for the 2012 model year. The Verano is derived from the succeeding Astra J.

===Engines===
Engines were available with 5- and 6-speed manual transmission, &quot;Easytronic&quot; automated manual gearbox with 5-speeds, and also 4- and 6-speed automatic transmission. In the beginning there were petrol 1.4 90 PS, 1.6 105 PS, 1.8 125 PS and new 2.0 Turbo engine with two versions: 170 PS and 200 PS. Diesel lineup were 1.3 CDTI with 90 PS, 1.7 CDTI with 80 PS, 100 PS, and 1.9 CDTI engines with 120 and 150 PS. During production some engine got more power like 1.6, 1.8, 1.7, 1.9 and 2.0 Turbo with 240 PS was introduced in 2005 in OPC/VXR version. 1.3 CDTI 90 PS was introduced in 2005 and he replaces 1.7 CDTI with 80 PS.

After restyle at end of 2006 / beginning of 2007, new engines were introduced: 1.6 Turbo engine with 180 PS which replace 2.0 Turbo with 170, and 1.7 CDTI with 125 PS.

== Fourth generation (Astra J – P09; 2009) ==
The Astra J is based on the General Motors&#x27; Delta II platform, debuted at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show in Germany and went on sale in November 2009 as a 2010 model while the 2009 model year was entirely skipped. The car has taken most of its styling from the new Opel Insignia, with many of the higher options fitted as standard. Full production came on line at Vauxhall&#x27;s Ellesmere Port Plant at the end of September 2009. Deliveries began in December 2009. Referred to as the &quot;Astra I&quot;, it officially received the &quot;Astra J&quot; name instead to avoid confusing the letter I for the number 1.

The Astra was developed at Opel&#x27;s &#x27;International Technical Development Center&#x27; (ITDC) in Rüsselsheim and continues Opel&#x27;s design language, ‘sculptural artistry meets German precision’ first introduced on the Insignia. The Astra features a torsion beam rear suspension with Watt&#x27;s link. Infotainment and car navigation systems are supplied by Bosch.

The Opel Astra came third in the European Car of the Year award in 2010.

The station wagon version of the Astra - dubbed the &#x27;Sports Tourer&#x27; by Opel, debuted at the 2010 Paris Motor Show, and went on sale shortly afterwards, with a starting price of £16,575 for the ES version, then Exclusiv, SRI and SE versions, with the SE costing from £20,345. This is cheaper than the previous estate, but has more standard equipment. The adoption of the &quot;Sports Tourer&quot; name finally brought to an end Opel&#x27;s traditional &quot;Caravan&quot; designation for its station wagon derivatives.

The pre-facelift Astra J was briefly sold in Australia under the Opel brand, with its introduction into the Australian market in 2012. However, the Opel brand and nameplate subsequently pulled out of the Australian market in 2013 due to poor sales, and later versions of the Astra J, namely the OPC and GTC variant, were sold under the Holden brand name from 2013 onwards.

Shanghai GM launched the Chinese version of the Opel Astra hatchback, which is badged as the Buick Excelle XT. This car went on sale in January 2010. Three engines were announced: Ecotec D-VVT 1.6 L, 1.8 L and 1.6 L Turbo.

The saloon version of the Astra was first presented at the 2012 Moscow International Automobile Salon. The 4-door saloon has a number of names depending on market: Buick Excelle GT in China, Buick Verano in North America and Opel Astra sedan/saloon elsewhere. This version is not sold in the United Kingdom, although it is available in some other right hand drive markets, such as Ireland (as the: Astra Saloon), Malta, and South Africa. Production for the saloon version continued until 2018 after the Astra K was released to supply several markets where saloons are popular, including Turkey.

===GTC===
A 3-door version dubbed Astra GTC was introduced in July 2011. Externally, it retains very few design elements of the old 5-door model. It has a sportier appearance, with a much more &#x27;sculpted&#x27; chassis. It features a HiPerStrut front suspension from the Opel Insignia OPC which helps alleviate torque steering. A Watt&#x27;s linkage is present in the rear suspension, to minimize lateral movement of the axle. The wheelbase is enhanced to accommodate wider low-profile tyres. Similarly to the Astra H GTC, a &#x27;panoramic windscreen&#x27; option is available. The Astra GTC was awarded a 5 star rating for its performance under Euro NCAP safety tests. In late 2013, a new 1.6 Turbo EcoTec engine with 200PS output replaced the older 180PS engine of the same capacity, meaning the 1.6 Turbo replaces the BiTurbo Diesel as the fastest non-OPC model in the range.

The GTC is built in Gliwice, Poland, with a range of models &amp; petrol and diesel engines. In the UK, the GTC includes the SRi and VXR models. Production continued alongside the Astra K when it was introduced in 2015, and concurrently dropped the Astra moniker for simply GTC. In 2018, the model was discontinued.

====Models and colours====
There are three models of the GTC, Sport, the SRi, Limited Edition, and the VXR model. Available colours are Power red (Solid), the &quot;Brilliant&quot; colours are Summit white &amp; Flaming yellow, The Metallic colours are Granite grey, Deep sky blue, Carbon flash, Sovereign silver &amp; Flip chip silver, The Pearlescent colours are Emerald green &amp; Asteroid grey. The VXR also has Flash blue.

=== Astravan ===
This generation Astra was not available as the commercial version Astravan. But in The Netherlands, the Astra Sports Tourer was available as Astravan at special order.

===Engines===
Engines are available with the 5-speed or 6-speed manual transmission.
The only optional available automatic transmission is the 6-speed with active select mode, which can be ordered for the 1.4 turbo, 1.6, 1.6 turbo and 2.0 CDTI depending on region. From 2011, Start/Stop was introduced in certain countries on some models, and from 2012 an overboost function was added to the 1.4 turbo. [Engines with (S/S) are in bold in column]. The engines are Family 0/Family 1/Ecotec/MGE (petrol), and MultiJet/Circle L/GM MDE (diesel).

In February 2014, Opel introduced its all-new engine - GM Medium Diesel engine, the so-called &quot;whisper diesel&quot; 1.6 CDTI engine with 136 PS, and later with 110 PS.

===Facelift===
In June 2012, a facelift was announced. Visual changes occurred at the front and back of the hatchback and sports tourer. This included revised bumpers and grills and very minor changes to the headlights. The rear lights were also revised, and had an overall darker appearance, the registration-plate recess of the five-door model was re-designed, and the Sports Tourer (estate body) and 5-door hatchback model received new-style bumpers with chrome trim. New colours were introduced, such as Sculpture Bronze, Phantom Grey and Deep Sky metallic, plus others which were available as extra-cost options. The updated Astra also received some assistance systems such as the &quot;Eye&quot; front camera with enhanced traffic-sign assistant (TSA II), lane-departure warning (LDW), following-distance indication (FDI) and forward-collision alert (FCA); also available are a rear-view camera, advanced park assist and side-blind-spot alert. A saloon variant was introduced, but only to a very few markets. Engine-wise, the 195-PS 2.0 BiTurbo CDTI from the Insignia became available from autumn 2012, and a new 1.6 L 170 PS turbocharged SIDI Ecotec direct injection unit from the new &quot;MGE&quot; engine family was added in early 2013.

== Fifth generation (Astra K – B15; 2015) ==


Opel officially unveiled the Astra K on 1 June 2015 and made its official premiere at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2015.

The Astra K is smaller (5cm), and lighter (up to 200kg) compared to Astra J. Although it is smaller on the outside, Opel claims it is bigger on the inside than the previous Astra J. Depending on the model and trim level it is up to 200 kilograms - at the very least 120 kilograms - lighter than its predecessor. The completely new vehicle architecture plays a major role in the weight reduction. Every component was checked for compact design and lightweight materials. The bodyshell weight alone was reduced by 20 per cent from 357 to 280 kilograms. Additional, chassis-related measures resulted in another 50 kilograms of weight reduction; these include high-strength and ultra-high-strength low-weight steels, compact subframes as well as weight reductions to the front and rear axle. Rear suspension is torsion beam (only with Watts linkage on top engines), and MacPherson struts at the front.

Available engines are 1.0-litre three-cylinder and 1.4-litre four-cylinder petrol engines or 1.6-litre diesels. It is available with full-LED front light techniques, A screen in the dash which connect to Android or iPhone comes as standard. This system is already available, in both the Corsa E and Adam.

===Engines===
Engines are available with the 5-speed or 6-speed manual transmission, and the newly developed 5-speed &quot;EasyTronic 3.0&quot; automated manual, which is only available for the 1.0T SIDI engine. The only other available automatic transmission, at the beginning of production, is the 6-speed with active select mode, which can be ordered in late 2015, for the 1.4 SIDI Turbo with 150 PS, and 1.6 CDTI with 136 PS. Buyers can choose the Start/Stop system for all engines as an extra feature, except the 1.0T which will have system as standard.

All engines are new and recently developed by Opel - 1.0T SIDI, 1.4T SIDI (which sees its debut in the Astra K in 2015) and the naturally aspirated version of it (which will be available later in 2015), and the so-called &quot;Whisper diesel&quot; 1.6 CDTI. All turbocharged petrol engines use the Direct Injection Fuel system.

Opel are offering the ecoFLEX range for 1.0T, 1.4T and 1.6 CDTI engines which have same amount of power, but less CO2-emissions (g/km) and lower fuel consumption. The entire ecoFLEX range have Start/Stop as standard, low rolling resistance tyres and aerodynamic tweaks for reduced drag for lower CO2-emissions. The 1.4T SIDI ecoFLEX version have less torque, rated at at 2.000-4.000 rpm.

In 2019 Opel announced the move to the new GM E-Turbo 1.2-litre, &quot;1.4-litre&quot; (actually a 1.3-litre) three-cylinder petrol engines, and 1.5-litre three-cylinder diesels.

=== Facelift ===
A facelift of Opel Astra K released around the summer of 2019. Changes were minimal, both inside and outside; however the facelifted Astra sports a new front grille, new rear lights, as well as a new windscreen wiper mechanism, where both wipers are individually controlled as opposed to a linked setup as before.

The last Astra to be produced in Ellesmere Port rolled off the assembly line on December 13, 2021.
The last Astra to be produced in Gliwice factory rolled off the assembly line on November 30, 2021.

==Motorsport==
An Astra won the Andros Trophy for three consecutive years starting in 2000.

The Astra Coupé in BTC-T form was dominant in the British Touring Car Championship from 2001 until 2004, and it continued to compete in the series until 2006.

An Astra was used in the 1994 Super Tourenwagen Cup season. In 2002, 2003 and 2006, three different drivers were European Rallycross Champions in the Division 2 driving Astras. The 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2008 runners-up also raced in that car. Christian Ledesma was 2004 TC 2000 champion with an Astra and Matías Rossi took that title in 2006 and 2007.

A rally version of the Astra was built to the FIA 2-Litre World Rally Cup. The car finished second in class on the 1998 Rally of Great Britain, and claimed the British Rally Championship for manufacturers in 2000.

The Astra has been used in the shape of silhouette racing cars as well. It was featured in the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters from 2000 to 2003 (Manuel Reuter was runner-up in 2000) and overall winner of the 2003 Nürburgring 24h race and the Stock Car Brasil from 2004 to 2008 (Giuliano Losacco won the tournament in 2004 and 2005). In 2009, the Astra G body was replaced Stock Car Brasil by a Vectra, which is in fact the same as the Astra H.

The car has also been raced in the Russian Touring Car Championship, the 2004 European Touring Car Championship season, the 2006 Swedish Touring Car Championship season, the 2008 European Touring Car Cup and the 2013 European Rallycross Championship season.

==Latin American models (1994–2011)==

===Chevrolet Astra===
The Chevrolet Astra is essentially the same vehicle as the Opel Astra, but with some mechanical differences.
In Brazil, the Chevrolet Astra was launched at 1994 as 1995 model only in five-door hatchback and station wagon body styles. It was available only in the GLS trim level with a 2.0-litre, eight-valve multipoint fuel injection engine with a power of . The plan was to replace the Chevrolet Kadett, an Opel Kadett E built locally, but an increase in taxes for import cars (from 35 to 70 per cent) made General Motors of Brazil stop importing the model for the 1996 model year. The Chevrolet Astra returned in 1998, in second generation and built locally. Initially, it only came in three-door hatchback and four-door sedan body styles, and GL and GLS trim levels. The engine options were a 1.8 litre with and a 2.0 litre with , both with eight valves. Later models received the option of a 2.0 litre, 16-valve engine, initially with a power of and later yet with .

In 2003, the Astra range received an exterior facelift, with a five-door hatchback completing the range. The 1.8 litre engine was discontinued, with a 2.0 litre flexfuel (ethanol and petrol) being launched for the 2004 model year. The 2.0 FlexFuel power was depending on the fuel used; later this changed to . A GSI 2.0 16V was launched with the 2003 facelift and produced until 2005. The range did not change much until its discontinuation in 2011, being in effect replaced by the Chevrolet Sonic and Cobalt.

;Chile
In Chile, the Astra was sold under the Opel brand until 1997 (replacing the Kadett); beginning in 1999, the second generation was imported from Brazil under the Chevrolet brand. The third generation was again imported from Europe; in 2017, it returned to be sold under Opel brand.

===Chevrolet Vectra (Brazil)===
The Opel Astra H was sold in Brazil and Argentina between 2006 and 2011, as Chevrolet Vectra and Vectra GT (hatchback), replacing Vectra B. It shared the powertrain and the platform with the Astra G, except when equipped with the 2.4 engine, and it was inserted above the Astra in both markets. It was replaced by the flagship versions of the Chevrolet Cruze.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Broderers is one of the livery companies of the City of London. Broderers were workers in embroidery; the organization of Broderers existed in at least 1376, and was officially incorporated by a royal charter in 1561. As the craft of embroidery has lost its importance as a trade, the company has become less of a trade association for broderers. Instead, the company is now, as are most livery companies, a charitable foundation.

The company is the forty-eighth in the order of precedence for livery companies. Its motto is &quot;Omnia Desuper&quot;, Latin for &quot;All From Above&quot;.

The livery hall of the Broderers, Broderers&#x27; Hall, stood on Gutter Lane from 1515 until its destruction in the London blitz. The Broderers now dine in Mercers&#x27; Hall.

<doc id="373874" wikidata="Q653333" url="?curid=373874" title="Michael Ovitz">
<text>Michael Steven Ovitz (born December 14, 1946) is an American businessman. He was a talent agent who co-founded Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in 1975 and served as its chairman until 1995. Ovitz later served as president of The Walt Disney Company for only 16 months from October 1995 to January 1997.

==Early life and education==
Ovitz was born to a Romanian Jewish family in Chicago, Illinois, the son of a liquor wholesaler. Raised in Encino, California, he was student body president at Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, a classmate of Sally Field and Michael Milken. 

Ovitz graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1968 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology. While a student at UCLA and president of Zeta Beta Tau, he began his entertainment career as a part-time tour guide at Universal Studios.

== Career ==
After his graduation from UCLA, Ovitz secured a job in the mailroom at the William Morris Agency. From there, he left for law school but returned shortly (something William Morris normally did not allow). He was soon promoted, eventually becoming a highly successful television agent. Six years later, he and four other young colleagues left William Morris to found Creative Artists Agency.

===Creative Artists Agency===
Dissatisfied with his pay and promotion opportunities, Ovitz and fellow William Morris agents Ronald Meyer, William Haber, Rowland Perkins and Michael S. Rosenfeld planned to form their own agency after raising money. Learning of their plans, William Morris fired them in January 1975. Borrowing $21,000 from a bank, the agents rented a small office, conducting business on card tables and rented chairs, their wives taking turns as agency receptionist.

Ovitz reportedly had three new film packaging deals sold in the first week. Within four years CAA had $90.2 million in annual bookings and was the third-largest Hollywood agency. Under his direction, CAA quickly grew from a start-up organization to the world&#x27;s leading talent agency, expanding from television into film, investment banking and advertising. Ovitz was known for assembling package deals, wherein CAA would utilize its talent base to provide directors, actors and screenwriters to a studio, thus shifting the negotiating leverage from the studios to the talent. As CAA rose in stature Ovitz became one of the most powerful men in Hollywood; he was so influential that, when &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote about him in 1989, industry executives, directors, and actors refused to comment or would only do so if CAA allowed it.

Promoted to president then to chairman of the board, Ovitz&#x27;s roles at CAA were numerous. He served as talent agent to Hollywood actors Tom Cruise, Dustin Hoffman, Kevin Costner, John Belushi, Michael Douglas, Bill Murray, Sylvester Stallone and Barbra Streisand as well as directors Steven Spielberg, Barry Levinson, and Sydney Pollack. He also provided corporate consulting services, helping negotiate several major international business mergers and deals including Matsushita&#x27;s acquisition of MCA/Universal, the financial rescue of MGM/United Artists, and Sony&#x27;s acquisition of Columbia Pictures. Ovitz&#x27;s signing of Coca-Cola as a CAA client from agency McCann-Erickson had a significant impact on the advertising industry. He negotiated David Letterman&#x27;s move from NBC to CBS, chronicled in the book &quot;The Late Shift: Letterman, Leno, and the Network Battle for the Night&quot; by Bill Carter. He disliked publicity, however, with the &quot;Times&quot; reporting that &quot;Ovitz is one of the very few people in the world who own almost all the photographs ever taken of them&quot;.

===Disney===

Ovitz resigned from CAA in 1995 to become president of The Walt Disney Company under chairman Michael Eisner. Ovitz quickly grew frustrated with his role in the company and vague definition of duties. After a tumultuous year as Eisner&#x27;s second in command, he was dismissed by Eisner in January 1997 and left Disney with a (previously agreed-upon) severance package valued at $38 million in cash and an estimated $100 million in stock.

Disney shareholders later sued Eisner and Disney&#x27;s board of directors for awarding Ovitz such a large severance package. Later court proceedings reflect that Ovitz&#x27;s stock options were granted when he was hired to induce him to join the company, not granted when he was fired. In 2005 the court upheld Disney&#x27;s payment.

=== Artist Management Group and controversy ===
In January 1999, Ovitz formed CKE, comprising four distinct companies: Artist Management Group (AMG), Artist Production Group (APG), Artist Television Group (ATG) and Lynx Technology Group (LTG). In 2002 Ovitz sold AMG to Jeff Kwatinetz for an undisclosed amount, which was merged into his management group The Firm.

After the sale of AMG, Ovitz became the subject of controversy for remarks made in a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; interview, wherein he blamed the downfall of AMG upon a cabal led by Dreamworks cofounder David Geffen which Ovitz described as the &quot;gay mafia&quot;. In addition to Geffen, the list included &quot;The New York Times&quot; correspondent Bernard Weinraub, Disney chairman (and former employer) Michael Eisner; Bryan Lourd, Kevin Huvane and Richard Lovett, partners at CAA, Universal Studios president Ronald Meyer (Ovitz&#x27;s former partner at CAA); and Vivendi CEO Barry Diller. &quot;If I were to establish the foundation of the negativity&quot;, Ovitz stated, &quot;it all comes down to David Geffen and Bernie Weinraub. Everything comes back to those two. It&#x27;s the same group [quoted] in every article.&quot; He later apologized for his &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; comments.

==Personal life==
Ovitz acts as a private investor. Active in philanthropy, he donated $25 million in 1999 to spearhead fund raising efforts for UCLA&#x27;s Medical Center, and has contributed significantly to numerous other philanthropic endeavors. A private investor and businessman, his notable activities have ranged from attempts to bring an NFL team to the Los Angeles Coliseum to ventures in online media.

Ovitz is considered among the world&#x27;s top 200 art collectors. He owns works by Pablo Picasso, Jasper Johns, Willem de Kooning, Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko and many others.

He married Judy Reich whom he met in college and they have three children, including New York fashion designer Kimberly Ovitz.

In 2015, Ovitz became engaged to Tamara Mellon.

== Books ==
&quot;Who is Michael Ovitz?&quot; was a memoir published by Michael Ovitz recounting his time at the Creative Artists Agency (CAA) and his brief stint at The Walt Disney Company.

<text>William Frederick Rieflin (September 30, 1960 – March 24, 2020) was an American musician. Rieflin came to prominence in the 1990s mainly for his work as a drummer with groups (particularly in the industrial rock and industrial metal scenes) such as Ministry, the Revolting Cocks, Lard, KMFDM, Pigface, Swans, Chris Connelly, and Nine Inch Nails. He worked regularly with R.E.M. following the retirement of Bill Berry in 1997. He was a member of King Crimson from 2013 until his death in 2020.

==Career==

===Early years===

Rieflin was born on September 30, 1960, and began his professional career in his hometown of Seattle. In 1975, he was in The Telepaths, a band which played backup for a couple of live gigs by the pre-The Screamers band The Tupperwares.
He played drums for The Blackouts starting in 1979. His bandmates included Mike Davidson, Paul Barker, Roland Barker and Erich Werner. Eventually that band dissolved and Paul Barker joined the nascent Ministry. 

===Ministry, Pigface, solo work===

Rieflin&#x27;s earliest collaboration with Al Jourgensen was in 1986 on &quot;You Often Forget&quot;, the second single by the Revolting Cocks. Later, he participated in the creation of Ministry&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;The Land of Rape and Honey&quot;, and was noted for his performance in the live video &quot;In Case You Didn&#x27;t Feel Like Showing Up&quot; (alongside fellow drummer Martin Atkins). Rieflin&#x27;s work with Ministry and its side projects lasted through to the mid-nineties, though he noted that he was never credited as a member of Ministry proper, always as an &quot;other&quot; musician. Therefore, when he parted ways with the band during the &quot;Filth Pig&quot; sessions, he did not really quit since he was never an official member.

Rieflin helped Atkins kick off Pigface, the industrial collective that would grow to incorporate hundreds of artists, formed a friendship with labelmate Chris Connelly and founded First World Music. Like Connelly, Rieflin&#x27;s work grew beyond his industrial roots. They collaborated on several recordings; two in particular, &quot;The Ultimate Seaside Companion&quot; (as &quot;The Bells&quot;) and &quot;Largo&quot;, showcase Rieflin&#x27;s keyboard skills.

Rieflin&#x27;s solo debut, &quot;Birth of a Giant&quot;, featured him singing in something other than a background role, and also featured Robert Fripp. Improvisations from these sessions turned up later on the CD &quot;The Repercussions of Angelic Behavior&quot;, which was credited to Rieflin, Fripp and Trey Gunn.

===KMFDM, R.E.M.===

Rieflin appeared on all KMFDM records released from 1995 to 2003 as a drummer, programmer, vocalist and keyboardist. He toured with the band as a bassist in 2002 in support of its comeback album, &quot;Attak&quot; and performed on the 2011 KMFDM album, &quot;WTF?!&quot;. He also drummed for Scott McCaughey&#x27;s band, The Minus 5, which occasionally included R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck. 

Eventually Rieflin&#x27;s work with The Minus 5 led to Buck offering him the opportunity to sit in with R.E.M., who had been missing a permanent drummer since the 1997 departure of Bill Berry. The band gave him the live drummer slot in its 2003 tour. They later announced that Rieflin would fill the role indefinitely, though once again as a hired musician rather than as an official member. In recordings, Rieflin also contributed bouzouki, keyboards and guitars to the group, serving as an auxiliary member until R.E.M. disbanded in 2011.

===Robin Hitchcock, Slow Music, The Humans, Swans, Robbie Williams===

Rieflin, along with Scott McCaughey and Peter Buck, was a member of Robyn Hitchcock&#x27;s backing band &quot;The Venus 3&quot;, and appeared on three Hitchcock albums, from 2006 to 2010.

Rieflin was key to forming an experimental ensemble named Slow Music in 2005 with Fred Chalenor (bassist whom he had previously played drums with in the Seattle based instrumental LAND in the late 90&#x27;s), Hector Zazou, Matt Chamberlain, Peter Buck, and Robert Fripp; in this sextet Rieflin played synthesizers rather than drums. The group played a small handful of live dates in 2005 and 2006 and became inactive until 2014, when they played a few shows as a quintet due to Zazou&#x27;s passing in 2008. He was also involved in a music collaboration project entitled The Humans, which consisted of him, Chris Wong, Fripp and Toyah Willcox. The band performed a series of live dates in Estonia in Autumn 2007 and 2009, and released their debut album &quot;We are the Humans&quot; in 2009. Hector Zazou&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Corps Electriques&quot; featured Rieflin, as well as KatieJane Garside, Lone Kent and nu-jazz trumpeter Nils Petter Molvær.

Rieflin was a regular contributor to Swans, playing an array of instruments from the 1995 album &quot;The Great Annihilator&quot; through 2016&#x27;s &quot;The Glowing Man&quot;. (He is listed as an &quot;honorary Swan&quot; on the band&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;The Seer&quot;.)

In 2012, Rieflin performed on drums for Robbie Williams&#x27;s album &quot;Take the Crown&quot;. Later that year he produced the single &quot;Crush Vaccine&quot; for Atomic Bride.

===King Crimson===

In an online diary entry dated September 6, 2013, Robert Fripp announced a new lineup for King Crimson that included Rieflin as one of the band&#x27;s three drummers. Although this particular version of King Crimson would never record a studio album, Rieflin would play live with the band for the rest of his career.

Following two-and-a-half years of touring (during which new percussion pieces incorporating Rieflin&#x27;s drumming work made their way into King Crimson&#x27;s live repertoire) and a few days after the first full-length live release of the band with Rieflin on board (&quot;Live in Toronto 2015&quot;), Fripp announced Rieflin&#x27;s decision to take a sabbatical from the band, effective March 6, 2016. This was &quot;a decision supported by all the Crimson Brothers.&quot; He was replaced on drums by Jeremy Stacey for the following year of group activity. In early 2017, Fripp announced that Rieflin would return to the band, but that (due to Fripp&#x27;s desire to stave off complacency after several years of touring) Stacey would continue to drum for the group while Rieflin himself &quot;[would] be focusing on mellotron, keys and fairy dusting, rather than using drums as a main instrument&quot; in the new Double Quartet configuration. 
Rieflin thus became the band&#x27;s first ever full-time dedicated keyboardist. 

At the time of King Crimson&#x27;s US Autumn 2017 tour dates in October–November, Rieflin once again needed to take time away from the group. The Seattle-based guitarist Chris Gibson temporarily covered for him on keyboards during the autumn tour. Rieflin rejoined the band in 2018 before taking another indefinite sabbatical in 2019. He was tentatively and temporarily replaced on keyboards by Soft Machine&#x27;s sax player Theo Travis for initial rehearsals before Fripp and the band made the decision to not replace Rieflin, thus reverting King Crimson to a seven-member band. Fripp would summarise the situation as &quot;regardless of the quality of player depping for Bill, simply, Bill is irreplaceable. It&#x27;s not the notes that are played, it&#x27;s the Billness of Bill that Master Rieflin brings to the group.&quot; 

Although he would not appear onstage with King Crimson again, Rieflin would remain a nominal and fully-respected member of the band until his death a year later. Via retrospective footage, he played a significant part in Toby Amies&#x27; 2022 documentary &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King: King Crimson at 50&quot;, candidly discussing his terminal stage 4 colon cancer, his imminent death, and his choice to spend his final years playing music with King Crimson.

==Personal life and death==

Rieflin was married to painter Francesca Sundsten until her death in 2019. Rieflin died on March 24, 2020, from colon cancer, at the age of 59.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Upholders is one of the Livery Companies of the City of London. &quot;Upholder&quot; is an archaic word for &quot;upholsterer&quot;. In past times, upholders did not just manufacture and sell upholstered goods but were cabinet makers, undertakers, soft furnishers, auctioneers, and valuers. The organisation was formed on 1 March 1360 and officially incorporated by a Royal Charter granted by Charles I in 1626. The Company originally had the right to set standards for upholstery within London and to search, seize and destroy defective upholstery. However, over the years, the Company&#x27;s power has eroded, as has the profession of upholsterers, because of the advancement of technology.

The Livery&#x27;s purpose today is:
:To Uphold the livery of the Upholders, ensuring it continues to flourish. Upholding the craft of the Upholder and through charitable giving uphold individuals and organisations connected with our trade and Livery.

In support of the upholstery and soft furnishing trade, the Livery provides prizes and bursaries to students studying these crafts. It gives Merit Awards to companies achieving the highest standards of craftsmanship and Master Craftsman awards to individuals. Working closely with the Association of Master Upholsterers and Soft Furnishers, it is developing a &quot;Centres of Excellence&quot; scheme for colleges and other organisations to ensure traditional upholstery skills are taught and passed on to professionals and enthusiasts. In 2017, the first Upholders&#x27; apprentice to complete his training through the Livery Companies&#x27; Apprenticeship Scheme was awarded his certificate by the Lord Mayor of London. In addition to working with the AMUSF, the company supports the Guild of Traditional Upholsterers. The Livery provides several pensions to special-needs pensioners who have worked in the trade.

Upholders arranged the funeral of Admiral Lord Nelson, and the Livery is proud to include undertakers today. Members of the company continue to be involved with the funerals of national figures. The name Undertaker also has Upholder as its root.

The Livery, through its charities, the Peter Jackson Charity, and the Neville Hayman Charity, supports its crafts &amp; artisans and other charities connected with the City of London and the armed forces. The Livery has close connections with TS Upholder, the Chelmsford Sea Cadet unit.

The Livery and Liverymen are actively involved in many organisations and charities in the City of London, including Castle Baynard Ward Club, as the site of the Company&#x27;s Hall until the Great Fire in 1666 is in the Ward. The Company is the forty-ninth in the order of precedence for Livery Companies. Its motto is &quot;Sustine Bona&quot;, Latin for &quot;Uphold the Good&quot;.

<doc id="373888" wikidata="Q5472935" url="?curid=373888" title="Forty-fives">
<text>Forty-fives (also known as auction forty-fives, auction 120s, 120, and growl) is a trick-taking card game that originated in Ireland. The game is popular in many communities throughout Atlantic Canada (New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island) as well as the Gaspé Coast in Québec. Forty-fives is also played in parts of Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire in New England, United States, as well as in the South Island of New Zealand.

There are several regional variations. Traditional Forty Fives goes to a score of 45 points, hence the name of the game. In the Auction Forty Fives variant the score goes to 120 points and requires bidding. In many areas outside of Canada, Auction Forty Fives is simply referred to as Forty Fives. Although the number 45 has no relevance to Auction Forty Fives, the name persisted. Auction Forty Fives is closely related to the game One-hundred and ten.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Forty-fives is a descendant of the Irish game, Twenty-five, a variant of Spoilt Five, which in turn is a descendant of a game that King James VI of Scotland popularized in the 17th century called Maw. Scottish emigrants to Atlantic Canada may explain the reason for the popularity of the game there. Maw dates to at least 1548 and is regularly reported up to around 1650 and the earliest written rules of 1576, the incomplete &quot;Groom Porter&#x27;s lawes at Mawe,&quot; may have originated from Scotland. James VI was recorded playing &quot;Maye&quot; at Kinneil House at Christmas 1588. The daughters of Elizabeth Kitson, Meg and Mary played Maw at Hengrave Hall at Christmas 1572.

=== 19th century ===
By 1831, the game had reached America because Eliza Leslie records a simple version that year of what she calls Five and Forty in a book for American girls. A full pack is used. Any number may play and the first dealer is chosen by cutting; highest deals (Aces high). The cards are shuffled and cut before the dealer deals 5 cards each before turning the next for trump. Eldest hand leads to the first trick and players may always play any card. The trick is won by the highest trump or the highest card of the led suit if no trumps are played. The trick winner places the trick beside her and leads to the next trick. Each trick taken scores 5 points and 45 is game.

=== Recent history ===
In the 1920s, French Canadian economic migrants who moved south into Massachusetts and New Hampshire in New England introduced the game, where it continues to be popular, sometimes under the French name quarante-cinq. In this region the game is most popular in southern New Hampshire and the Merrimack Valley of northeastern Massachusetts. Forty fives tournaments are becoming increasingly popular there. For example, the New England Academy of Forty-Fives holds occasional tournaments in Plaistow, New Hampshire, and Methuen, located in the Merrimack Valley, recently held a Forty-Fives tournament. At the community level a popular pastime on Dog Beach in Newbury, Massachusetts, is to play auction Forty-Fives at low tide during green head season.

In New Brunswick Forty-Fives was a popular evening pastime at lumber camps during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as with men congregating at general stores. The Auction Forty-Fives variant is popular through the province at community &quot;card parties&quot;. For example, in the greater Harvey Station, New Brunswick area (GHA) biweekly card parties are popular with cottagers and local residents alike during the Spring-Fall months at the Lodges of the Ladies&#x27; Orange Benevolent Association (L.O.B.A) Tweedside. In the GHA there are also weekly gatherings at the 50+ Hall, Prince William.

On Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, notably in Richmond County, there are &quot;45-Card-Games&quot; in almost all communities. This may involve tens or hundreds of people depending on the size of the jackpot. Generally 25 games are played in an evening, couples only, usually lasting about two hours. Winning teams rotate around the room, while the losers remain stationary. Winners always deal first. Each couple has a small cue card with the numbers 1 through 25, wins are punched out with a hole punch. Usually there are three winners for the evening, the teams with the highest number of games. Ties may be broken by &quot;splitting&quot; the prize, cutting the deck for low card win, or &quot;playing off&quot;. If one party wants to play-off, others either do so or forfeit; splitting must be unanimous. Thus, if two couples have 18 games, a third couple 16 games and a fourth and fifth couple 15 games, then the third couple is automatically the second-place winner. First and third place prizes are either split, or the deck is cut, or there is a play-off. Sometimes there is a &quot;cookie jar,&quot; where a couple can attempt to win eight or ten randomly chosen games. Sometimes there is a consolation-like &quot;boobie prize&quot; for the team with the fewest games.

Forty-fives is popularly played on the West Coast of the South Island of New Zealand. Regular 45&#x27;s Tournaments are held as a fun night out in locations like Workingman&#x27;s clubs and RSA buildings. Serious competition tournaments are held yearly. There was a large percentage of Irish immigrants on the West Coast, normally around a third of immigrants to this region of New Zealand in colonial times, and the game of 45s originated from among these immigrants.

Forty-five is still played in many places in Ireland, with tournaments called 45 Card Drives being played.

==Card ranks==

The ranking of cards depends on which suit is the trump suit. The trump suit follows a trump suit ranking, beginning with the 5, J, and . The is always considered part of the trump suit, even if the trump suit is not hearts. Cards from the non-trump suits, known as &quot;off-suits&quot;, follow off-suit rankings beginning with the K, Q and J.

Any card from the trump suit beats any cards from an off-suit. In the absence of a trump card, the best card from the off-suit that was led wins the trick.

There are unique rankings to remember for number cards and for off-suit Aces. In red suits, 10 is best and 2 is worst; but in black suits, 2 is best and 10 is worst. A simple way to remember this is &quot;red is high, black is low.&quot; The ranking of off-suit Aces also depends on the suit. In black off-suits, the A is stronger than number cards but weaker than face cards, while in diamonds the A is the weakest card. 

==Rules==

===Traditional forty-fives (45 point)===
The game is played with a regular deck of 52 cards. One joker is used also. Players are dealt 5 cards each. Each player is dealt three cards at once, starting with eldest hand, the player left of the dealer, and continuing in a clockwise-direction, then each player is dealt two cards at once in the same order. The dealer never deals more than three cards at a time.

The top card of the deck is turned face up. The card that is shown determines the trump suit and that card is left on top of the deck. If an ace is turned up, that is the trump suit but the dealer must immediately claim the ace by discarding one of his dealt cards. If any of the players is dealt the ace of the trump suit, then he may claim the card that was turned up by discarding one of his other cards. This must be done before he plays his first card.

Each stage, where every player plays a card, is called a trick. As there are 5 cards in a hand, there will be 5 tricks played and won. One card is played by each player, in turn, starting with the player to the left of the dealer. The winner of the trick is determined by who played the highest card. The winner gets five points (on his way to 45). A bonus trick worth ten points rather than five points is awarded for the best card played during the round. This is determined at the end of the round.

Rule for which card may be played:
* Players must always follow the suit of the led card. 
* The led card can only be beaten by a higher card in the same suit or with a trump.
* Any trump suit card beats every non-trump suit card.
* The only time in which a player may choose not to follow trump suit is when the only trump card he has is the five, jack, joker or ace of hearts or if he does not have any cards of the trump suit. A player might wish to save the most powerful cards if he believes that another player is saving another strong card, or until he believes the other trump cards have been exhausted so that he can have the advantage of leading the remaining tricks. The action of holding a card in this fashion is known as reneging. (In the Merrimack Valley variant though, reneging is generally not allowed.)
* If the ace of hearts is led, players must always play a trump card to follow suit. If they have no trump (and trump is not hearts) they must play a heart if there is one in hand. If they have no trump or heart they may play any other card.

Once a player has revealed his card to players, that card is deemed to be played.

Points are added up based on tricks won and the bonus trick at the end of the round. Scores after the first round are &quot;full 30, 25–5, 20–10 or two 15s&quot; (note that the total must be 30). Scores after the second round are &quot;win, 40–20, 35–25 or two 30s&quot; (totalling 60). The score of the game is not written down, simply remembered by the players. If many games are played one should keep track of the number of games won. If it happens that all players have no trump, hence no &quot;best trump&quot; then the score after a round will only add up to 25.

If a player reached 45 points or more (including points earned in previous rounds), that player wins. If more than one player reaches at least 45 points in the same round, the player with more points is the winner. If no player reaches 45 points, the deal is given to the player to the left of the last dealer and a new round begins.

=== 120 point ===
In the 120-point version, the game goes to 120 points.

===Auction Forty-Fives===
There are four styles of play for auction forty-fives:
* &quot;Heads up&quot;: two players, one on one.
* &quot;Three-way cut-throat&quot;: In this game after a player wins the bid and calls the Trump, the other two players form a temporary unspoken truce to try to &#x27;shoot&#x27; the bidder. Players who do not honor this truce are seen as selfish and called nickel grabbers (each trick is worth 5 points).
* &quot;Five-way cut-throat&quot;: Similar to normal 3-man cut throat. In this game it is much harder to make your bid as it tends to be 4 vs. 1 and the bidder is often shot.
* &quot;Partners/teams&quot;: Either four or six players (two teams of 2, or two teams of 3), with teammates sitting in every other position. Points are pooled towards the overall team score, and towards bid.

Cards are dealt the same as in forty-fives except that three cards are dealt to the &quot;kitty&quot; after each player has their first three cards. Games are often played &#x27;no kitty&#x27; and are considered to be more legitimate.

Instead of the top card being turned over after the deal and determining trump, players bid based on the strength of their hand. Bidding is done before a trump suit is declared. Players bid 15, 20, 25, or 30 points based on how many points they think they can earn with their hand if they get to call the trump suit. (In some versions, if a player bids 30 a following bidder can go “30 for 60.&quot; If they win all five tricks, they earn 30 points. If they are set, they lose 60.) Bidding goes in the same order as the deal. If no one bids, choosing instead to pass, then the dealer automatically bids 15 and play resumes as normal. When this happens the dealer is said to have been &quot;bagged&quot;.

The player who wins the bid announces the trump suit and they must have at least one card of that suit in their hand. After trump is called (it is important for trump to be called prior to this step), the person who called trump adds the kitty to their hand. Players then discard any unwanted cards (usually non-trump suited cards except for the ace of hearts). If it is a six player game, then each player must keep a minimum of two cards to ensure cards do not run out. In a five player game they must keep at least one card. The winning bidder may not keep more than five cards.

In the same order as the original deal, the dealer replenishes each player&#x27;s hand so that all players have five cards. In some versions, if a player chooses to discard all five of their cards, the dealer will replenish their hand with &quot;four and a flip&quot; placing the fifth card face-up for all players to see.

The winning bidder plays first. The first card thrown is said to have been &quot;led&quot;. If the card led is in the trump suit, then each player must play a card of the trump suit if possible. If a player breaks this rule they are said to have &quot;reneged&quot;. The ace of hearts is always considered part of the trump suit. There is one legal circumstance where a trump card does not have to follow suit. If you have one of the three major cards, i.e. the 5 of trump, the jack of trump or the ace of hearts, you may &quot;renege&quot; the card(s) and not play a trump card. This only works with the three top cards, any other cards in hand must follow suit. Reneging is very powerful in playing partners or trying to take the last two tricks of a hand. The winning bidder does not have to lead play with trump suit nor do players have to lead with trump suit when they lead a trick but players must play trump suit if a trump suit card is played in the trick and they have a trump suit card remaining in their hand. One version of the game also states that if you do not trump into an off-trump hand, you are supposed to follow the suit of the card being led. In this version, if the ace of hearts is led and a following player has no trump cards, they must then play a heart should they have one. 

When points are counted at the end of the round, the winning bidder adds their point total only if it equals or beats their bid. If they do not &quot;meet their bid&quot; they instead subtract their bid amount. This is known as being &quot;set&quot;, &quot;shot&quot;, or &quot;setting the bidder&quot; The object for the players that did not win the bid, therefore, is to make as many points as possible while at the same time preventing the bidder from making their bid.

The trick with the highest ranked card of the hand is the bonus trick, and is worth 5 extra points, or 10 points total. One trick of 10 and the remaining 4 tricks of 5 points make up the 30 points possible with each hand.

Points are added from round to round until a player or team reaches 120 and wins. Winning the game is referred to as &quot;going out&quot;, and a player who is within 30 points of 120 is said to be &quot;on the green&quot; or &quot;on deck&quot;. (This means they are theoretically one hand away from winning the game.) If multiple players go out on the same hand, then the player who bid that hand wins. This is referred to as &quot;bidder goes out”. In three-way cut-throat, if the two non-bidders go out on the same hand and the bidder does not, the player with the most points after the hand is finished, wins. If these two players are tied after this hand, the game (and dealing order) continues as normal. The next player to have more points than both other players, wins.

In some versions, once any player or team reaches 100 points or more, they must win the bid to receive points. They are locked in at that score unless they are the bidder, and they win they will either win the game or their score will go down depending on if they make the bid or not. This encourages the remaining players to bid against a player who is approaching 120, so that he will rarely be able to win the bid cheaply.

===One-hundred and ten===

One-hundred and ten (110) is similar to the Merrimack Valley variant of forty-fives. In it, an extra hand is dealt, face down, by the dealer into the centre of the table. No trump card is turned. Once all hands have been dealt the &quot;bidding&quot; begins with the player to the dealer&#x27;s left, and proceeds in turn around the table. Each player must bid a minimum of fifteen points and five more points than the previous highest bidder, or pass. An exception to this rule is the dealer, who can appropriate (match) the highest bid and force the other players to either raise his bid or pass. Bidding continues to circulate around the table until all players have &quot;passed&quot; (i.e. the same player can bid, be raised, and raise again in turn).

When bidding has concluded the highest bidder declares which suit will be trumps. He then takes the hand dealt face down in the centre of the table and chooses his best five cards from the combination of the two hands. Meanwhile, the remaining players are entitled to draw up to three cards from the deck, first discarding from their own hand. When all players have obtained their hand the winning bidder has the option of playing first or requiring the player to his left to play first. If a player has the ace of trumps the player may turn over the cards remaining in the deck stub, one at a time, until a trump card is turned, then he may discard his weakest card in favour of the trump card, or choose not to.

A bonus of five points (bonus trick) is awarded to the player who plays the highest card during the course of the round, thus the maximum amount that can be bid or obtained in 30. If the bidder obtains or exceeds his bid his score increases by that amount, if he fails to reach his bid his score is reduced by the amount of the bid. All other players often co-operate (without collusion) to prevent the bidder from reaching his bid, though selfish interests can supersede this.

A player cannot progress beyond 105 unless he is the bidder. If a player wins tricks during another players bid, which would otherwise increase his score beyond 105, those scores do not count, nor are they assigned to any of the other players. This encourages the remaining players to bid against a player who is approaching one hundred and ten, so that he will rarely be able to win the bid cheaply. Scores can reduce below zero, it is common to set a cut off point (often minus 80) at which a player is removed from the game.

The first player to reach 110 wins the game.

Several variations of 110 exist. These include the removal of the ace of trumps rule, the use of jokers (usually valued just below the jack (knave) of trumps), the bell rule (where a successful call of 30 yields 60 points) and various reneging variations.

===Variations===
*If you prevent the winning bidder from winning enough tricks to score by only using non-trump cards you get 30 points.
*Dealer cannot hold until the bid is at least 20.
*Non-trump aces are the highest ranking non-trump cards regardless of the colour of the suit (common rule in New Brunswick/Nova Scotia).
* Before the deal, the player to the right of the dealer must cut the deck. For the next round the deal passes to the dealer&#x27;s left, so the dealer of one round always cuts in the next round, should there be one.
* In the Merrimack Valley variant of Auction Forty-Fives, the winning bidder plays first.
* One may deal two cards to all players and then three cards to all players if desired. This is the dealer&#x27;s choice. Two cards first is sometimes called the &quot;Newfoundland Deal,&quot; the &quot;Rocky Bay Deal,&quot; or the &quot;Dog Beach Deal.&quot;
* The bidder may discard their hand and &quot;go on the kitty&quot;. This means they can choose the trump only from the cards in the kitty. A variation on this is to even reject going on the kitty and instead &quot;go on the top card&quot;. This means that a player discards the kitty and is dealt a single card which they must declare as trump.
* Players may discard all five cards, but when being replenished, the fifth card is dealt face-up. This is known as &quot;four and a flip&quot;.
* In most games, it is considered appropriate to ask if a player is &quot;booked.&quot; To be &quot;booked&quot; is to have only cards of the trump suit. In this case, the asking player may then choose to fold or stay in the game.
* If a player or team wins when the opponents start the round with 40 points, it is called &quot;hanging a 40&quot;.
* Someone leading the Ace of Hearts might say &quot;Hearts on Hearts&quot; so that no one reneges.
* No reneging allowed or only the 5 of trump may be reneged.
* Any player whose score hits exactly &quot;45&quot; is set back to Zero—The dreaded Forty-Five Rule.
* Only the 5 is worth 10 points. If the 5 is not dealt and played, then the hand only has a total of 25 points.
* Scores below zero are called &quot;in the hole&quot; or &quot;in the box&quot;. A player cannot be removed from the game for having a score that is too low (i.e., there is hope for everyone...even the player at -80); the reason for this is due to the bonus points described below.
* A player can outbid a 30-point bid by bidding &#x27;30 for 60&#x27;. This means that if the player does not make 30 points, they lose 60 points. Depending on the rules, they could stand to win 60 points if they make their 30-point bid. Some variations also allow a &#x27;60 for 120&#x27; bid. Even if this rule is respected, it is still very uncommon.
* 30-for-60: Without looking at one&#x27;s cards one must call 30-for-60. It is the same as bidding 30 regularly but a player bidding 30-for-60 would get 60 points should they win all the tricks and drop 60 points should they lose any tricks.
* A 30 bid is always called &quot;30 for 60&quot;, which means that if the player or team gets all 30 points in the hand they get a bonus of an extra 30 points. If they do not win the bid they only go down 30 points. Thus a team at 65 points that bids &quot;30 for 60&quot; will either win the game or go down to 35 points.
* Slam: Basically the same as 30-for-60, but the player would get 120 points for winning all tricks and lose 60 if they fail to win all the tricks. A player may Slam at any time after looking at their five cards.
* &quot;5 players, call for your partner&quot;: Before looking at the kitty, the winning bidder calls for a card. The player who has the called card is the winning bidder&#x27;s partner for that hand. The player with the called card does not announce that they have it. The called card must be played on the second trick. If no one has the called card, then it&#x27;s 4 against 1.
* A common variation found in Nova Scotia does not use the joker, and uses the same card values as the traditional Irish game Twenty-five.

==Cultural depictions==
Thomas Cockson&#x27;s 1609 engraving &quot;The Revells of Christendome&quot; includes a description of the game maw being played:

Forty-fives appears in Thomas Head Raddall&#x27;s 1950 novel &quot;The Nymph and the Lamp&quot;, where it is described as &quot;practically the national game of Nova Scotia.&quot;

Alice Taylor mentions the game in her memoir &quot;Do You Remember?&quot;, and Alden Nowlan makes reference to the game in his story &quot;The Glass Roses&quot;. In an episode of &quot;Bob and Margaret&quot;, a passing motorcyclist strikes up a game while characters are stuck in traffic.

<doc id="373899" wikidata="Q1030898" url="?curid=373899" title="Holden Astra">
<text>The Holden Astra is a small car formerly marketed by Holden. The first couple of generations of Astra were made only for Australia, and was a derivative of the locally produced Nissan Pulsar. With the Button car plan coming into effect, it was replaced by the Holden Nova, a rebadged Toyota Corolla.

In 1995, Holden commenced selling the TR Astra in New Zealand. The TR was a rebadged version of the Opel Astra, which had been sold locally as an Opel since 1993. Holden discontinued the Nova line in Australia in favour of Opel&#x27;s TR. Following its implementation as an Opel, it quickly became successful in its TS (1998) generation, where it came close to becoming Australia&#x27;s best selling small car. The AH (2004) continued its success, before Holden discontinued Opel-sourced product range, replacing Astra with GM Daewoo&#x27;s Cruze.

On 1 May 2014, Holden announced plans to import the Opel Astra J GTC and Opel Astra J OPC with Holden badges to Australia and New Zealand, and the following generation replaced the Cruze officially in 2017. In late 2016 a new Holden Astra range was released comprising rebadged European Vauxhall/Opel Astra hatchbacks, (coded the BK series). This was followed in 2017 by rebadged Chevrolet Cruze sedans (coded BL), and rebadged Vauxhall Astra wagons (coded BK).

== First generation (LB, LC; 1984–1987) ==
The original Holden Astra, introduced in August 1984 as the LB series was a badge engineered Nissan Pulsar (N12). The Pulsar, a Japanese designed model, sold alongside the unique to Australia Astra line-up. The Pulsar for Australia was assembled in Clayton, Victoria; however, for the Astra the body panels were pressed at Holden&#x27;s Elizabeth, South Australia facility. Unlike its Nissan counterpart, the Astra was only offered as a five-door hatchback, with the three-door hatchback and four-door sedan body styles omitted from the range due to fears they would overlap with Nissan&#x27;s own Pulsar range. However, Holden&#x27;s continuation of the Gemini sedan range in 1985 was the nearest equivalent of this in the range.

The only engine available was a Nissan-designed 1.5-litre engine, locally manufactured, this engine produced and of torque. Transmission options were a five-speed manual or a three-speed automatic.

Compared to the N12 Pulsar, the Astra LB sported a distinctive grille, the work of Australian stylist Paul Beranger housing the Holden lion insignia in the centre. Also unique were Astra-only tail lamps, badging and decals.

A revised LC model was released in April 1986. Unleaded-fuel requirements uprated the engine displacement to 1.6 litres, power to and torque to . Model and trim changes were also a part of the update, including a new grille insert, and the addition of an SL model positioned below the SL/X and SL/E levels.

The Used Car Safety Ratings, published in 2008 by Monash University, found that first generation Astras (LB/LC) provide a &quot;significantly worse than average&quot; level of occupant safety protection in the event of an accident.

=== Specification levels ===
Two trim levels, the SL/X and the SL/E were offered in the LB Astra series, although a basic SL model arrived in 1986 with the LC upgrade.
* SL: entry-level model available upon the LC&#x27;s introduction.
* SL/X: introduced with LB series featured cloth trim, a digital clock and a combined radio receiver and Compact Cassette player.
* SL/E: added alloy wheels among other features to the equipment list. However, the LC update saw the SL/E specification downgraded from alloy wheels to steel wheels with plastic wheel covers.
== Second generation (LD; 1987–1989) ==
For the second generation LD Astra, the Nissan Pulsar was again used as the basis, this time using the latest N13 series. Unlike before, the LD was the result of a proper joint venture development programme. That is, Nissan provided the bodywork and Holden supplied powertrains for fitment in both applications.

Launched concurrently in July 1987, both the LD Astra and N13 Pulsar were offered in four-door sedan and five-door hatchback body styles. Outside of Australia though, three-door hatchback and station wagon body variants of the Nissan were also available.

Both 1.6 (; ) and 1.8-litre (; ) displacements of Holden&#x27;s Family II engine were offered in the Astra-Pulsar models. Badged as 1.6 and 1.8 injection, respectively, the term &quot;injection&quot; denoted the utilisation of fuel injection.

In July 1989, all associations with Nissan were severed and a new agreement between Toyota was formed. This relationship, known as the United Australian Automobile Industries (UAAI) was a continuation of the Australian Government&#x27;s Button Plan that started with Nissan. Nissan continued to use the Holden engines until 1991 before replacing their N13 Pulsar line with the N14, while at the same time entering a new model sharing alliance with Ford.

The Used Car Safety Ratings evaluation from 2008 found that LD series Astras provide a &quot;worse than average&quot; level of occupant protection in the event of an accident.

=== Specification levels ===
Of the three trim specifications offered, the SLX and SLE nameplates no longer featured the &quot;/&quot; symbol, as in SL/X. Besides this anomaly, the LD range mirrored that of the LC Astra:
* SL: entry-level variant, available only as five-door hatchback, featuring the five-speed manual transmission and 1.6-litre engine combination. The brake setup for the LD series Astra in any specification was a disc/drum setup, whereas the equivalent Australian Pulsars had four-wheel disc brakes as standard.
* SLX: was the second tier variant fitted with the 1.8-litre engine in coupled to either a five-speed manual or three-speed automatic transmission. The SLX also featured full plastic wheel trims, as opposed to the steel centre hubcap fitted to the SL.
* SLE: was the highest specification offered, available only as an automatic 1.8-litre. The SLE was equivalent to Pulsar&#x27;s GXE specification.

=== HSV Astra SV1800 ===

In September 1988, Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) launched the HSV Astra SV1800, which was a tuned version of the LD Astra. 65 vehicles were produced, consisting of 30 hatchbacks and 35 sedans. Upgrades from the standard Astra were limited to cosmetic and suspension changes, with both &quot;Stage 1&quot; and &quot;Stage 2&quot; suspension setups offered.
=== HSV Astra Aero ===
Alongside the SV1800 HSV built a toned down version of the LD Astra, sold as the Aero. Approximately 150 cars were created.

== Third generation (TR; 1995) ==
In 1995, the Holden Astra name was used again, this time in New Zealand for a model based on the Opel Astra F, Opel being the General Motors subsidiary in Germany. Imported from Vauxhall&#x27;s Ellesmere Port plant in the UK, this third-generation Astra model and was sold as a four-door sedan, five-door hatchback and five-door wagon.

Holden in Australia did not sell the Opel-based Astra, known as the TR series, until September 1996, after the dissolution of Australian Government Button car plan. This resulted in the collapse of UAAI, the Holden-Toyota alliance, and as result Holden opted to return to marketing rebadged General Motors vehicles. Between 1989 and 1996, the Astra&#x27;s role was fulfilled by the Nova, Holden&#x27;s version of Toyota&#x27;s Corolla (E90 and E100). Unlike New Zealand, the wagon was not offered.

During this period of badge engineering in Australia, General Motors New Zealand had used Opel as one of its main marques alongside Holden and Isuzu. Because the Button plan or local equivalent never existed in New Zealand, the two initial generations of Holden Astra (LB/LC and LD) were thus never available in that market.

Like the two previous generations, TR Astras were assessed in the 2008 Used Car Safety Ratings, and shown to provide an &quot;average&quot; level of protection.

=== Specification levels ===
* City: was the introductory model featuring a driver&#x27;s airbag, central locking, and power steering. The engine and transmission combination consisted of a 1.6-litre C16SE engine (; ) with a five-speed manual.
* GL: editions were fitted with front fog lamps, electric side mirrors and a tachometer over the City, and also featured a 1.8-litre C18SEL engine (; ) with the option of either manual or automatic transmission.
* GSi: was the sporty hatchback-only entrant, featuring dual airbags, alloy wheels, sports interior trim and suspension, along with a 2.0-litre X20XEV engine (; ) coupled to a five-speed manual.

== Fourth generation (TS; 1998) ==

In September 1998, the Astra was replaced again with a German Opel-engineered, Belgium-built version. Known as the TS Astra, it was equipped with either a 1.8- or a 2.2-litre petrol engine and was offered in City, CD, CDX, SXi and SRi specifications. The SRi was three-door hatchback only, and the standard Astra was only available with a 1.8-litre 16-valve engine. Models with a 5-stud wheel pattern have the ABS option factory-installed. The Astra CD gained 15-inch alloy wheels as standard equipment in circa 1999, replacing the steel wheels with hubcaps previously standard.

The TS Astra model change followed that of the Opel Astra G range, including the sedan, hatchback and convertible. However, the coupé by Bertone was not offered with a Holden badge. The drivetrain was identical to other cars in the Astra lineup, and as such, was not a bona-fide sports car. Like the Astra F, the Astra G was available as a wagon in New Zealand, but not Australia. In 2003, a 2.0-litre turbo engine became available. The standard Astra was only available with a 1.8-litre 16-valve engine, and lived on until 2005 as the Holden Astra Classic, alongside the new model. The philosophy behind this was for Holden to remain competitive in the market until the cheaper Viva model was introduced.

In accordance to the Monash University&#x27;s 2008 update to the Used Car Safety Ratings, TS Astra models were rated &quot;better than average&quot; in the field of crash safety protection.

=== Specification levels ===
* City: was the most basic TS model, available as a three- and five-door with a six-speaker audio system, dual airbags, disc brakes, adjustable headlamps, and triple information display. The engine was the 1.8-litre &quot;X18XE1&quot; engine with (1998–2000) and the uprated &quot;Z18XE&quot; with (2001–2004).
* CD: included City features, plus 15-inch alloy wheels, a CD player, ABS brakes, traction control, air conditioning, electronic mirrors, and power windows. Optional equipment available were: front fog lamps, 16-inch alloy wheels, cruise control, and a rear spoiler.
* CDX: released in December 2002 for MY03 and added over the CD version: cruise control, front fog lamps, climate control air conditioning, chrome trim around dials, side airbags (curtain airbags were also an option for MY04 models), heated leather seats and leather upholstery, and a larger, higher resolution MFD (multi-info display) with radio info, date, time, outside temperature, trip computer with instantaneous fuel consumption and L/100 km, distance to empty, crucial vehicle alerts (check control) and stopwatch.
* SXi replaced the City three-door for MY03 and sold between December 2002 and 2004. Over the previous City three-door, the SXi added front fog lamps and sports trim. Optional features included, a CD player, ABS brakes, alloy wheels, air conditioning, and a rear spoiler.
* SRi: released in October 2001 and carried the same equipment as the SXi, but was based on the CD variant except fitted with the 2.2-litre Z22SE engine.
* SRi Turbo: introduced in May 2003 as part of MY03 changes, this model is based on the SRi, except fitted with the 2.0-litre Z20LET turbocharged engine and has more standard equipment.
* Convertible: released in December 2001 and fitted with the 2.2-litre Z22SE engine. Convertible Turbo models arrived in May 2003 with the 2.0-litre Z20LET engine.
;Limited editions
* Olympic Edition: Holden produced Olympic Editions of both the City and CD grades edition launched in July 2000, included &quot;Sydney 2000&quot; Olympic badging.
* Equipe: was based on the Astra City, but added 15-inch alloy wheels and various combinations of extra features including cruise control, power windows, electric side-view mirrors, fog lamps, ABS Brakes and a rear spoiler. Equipe model was released in April 2001, April 2002, April 2003 and September 2003,and lasted until 2005(MY05)
* Limited Edition: special edition for the convertible, released in March 2004. Distinguished by 17-inch five-spoke alloy wheels, pale beige leather interior trim, rear parking sensors and &#x27;China Blue&#x27; metallic paint finish.
* Linea Rossa: special edition for the convertible, released in 2004. Distinguished by its 17-inch five-spoke alloy wheels, red and black Nappa leather trim, rear parking sensors, unique instrument cluster, Magma Red paint finish and &#x27;Linea Rossa&#x27; sill plates and floor mats.
== Fifth generation (AH; 2004) ==

The fifth generation AH Astra, based on GM&#x27;s T platform Opel Astra H was launched in November 2004 as a five-door hatchback only, manufactured in Belgium, selling alongside a Polish-built Astra TS sedan and hatchback. The sedan and hatchback TS Astra models carried an &quot;Astra Classic&quot; badge, but were finally dropped in late 2005, replaced by the Holden Viva, a rebadged Daewoo Lacetti. Between 2003 and 2004, the Holden Viva was marketed in Australia as a Daewoo Lacetti before Holden withdrew the brand from Australia due to unsustainably poor sales amid quality &amp; reliability issues.

Like the previous generation, the AH series was found to provide an &quot;average&quot; level of safety according to the 2008 Used Car Safety Ratings. At launch, AH Astras came with front- and side-impact airbags as standard inclusions, allowing the Astra to receive a three-star ANCAP crash safety rating.

Holden suspended importation of the AH Astra on 20 April 2009, citing currency fluctuations, perceived poor resale value and build quality problems. Holden&#x27;s import cessation, which resulted in no Astras arriving during June and July 2009, coincided with the introduction of the Holden Cruze, reported to be the direct replacement for the Holden Astra. On 31 August 2009, Holden confirmed that the cessation of Astra imports would become permanent, with no intention of further imports of either the then current AH series or the next generation car. Holden stated their small car efforts would now be focused on the new Cruze, instead of the unsuccessful Astra.

=== Model year changes ===
* MY05: the AH range expanded in August 2005 with the release of the Astra coupe and station wagon to uplift slow sales. 
* MY06: Released in October 2005, this update saw the Astra CD and CDX models receive a chrome grille in place of the previous body-coloured one.
* MY06.5: Quality control related revisions from June 2006 added head-protecting side curtain airbags as standard equipment for the CDX. Also released was the turbodiesel hatchback, badged CDTi. Two versions of the diesel were offered: a 1.9-litre version with teamed with a six-speed manual transmission known as the &quot;Z19DTH&quot;, and a six-speed automatic model with the &quot;Z19DT&quot;, producing . This was a first for the Astra in Australia, but not New Zealand where the Astra TS had previously been offered with a 1.7-litre turbodiesel. Acceleration was fair to average, but fuel economy was improved over the outgoing model. Astra CD and CDX models received front fog lamps, previously only found on the CDXi.
* MY07: models appeared in January 2007, coinciding with the release of the Astra SRi and Twin Top convertible. Both releases came with a more powerful 2.2-litre &quot;Z22YH&quot; petrol engine producing , available with the six-speed manual or four-speed automatic.
* MY07.5: in April 2007 the Astra line-up received a facelift including a tweaked front grille which added a V-shaped centre in the chrome strip which was also shared by its UK Vauxhall equivalent, lights on all models, new 16 inch alloy design for CDX and CDTi models, and black tinted headlamps for sport variants. The 1.8-litre petrol engine also benefited from an upgrade to &quot;Z18XER&quot; with a power upgrade from to . The 2.2-litre engines available in the SRi, and Twin Top remained the same, as did the 2.0-litre turbo in the Astra SRi Turbo.
* MY08: changes from October 2007 saw the deletion of the five-door SRi, leaving only the SRi coupé, and the Twin Top with the 2.2-litre engine.
* MY08.5: minor, non-cosmetic update from May 2008 onwards. MY08.5 Astras received electronic stability control (ESC) as standard fitment across the entire lineup. ESC was previously limited to SRi and CDTi variants. This series also marked the return of the five-door SRi, although it was now standard with the 1.8 – as opposed to the 2.2-litre petrol engine previously fitted. This engine change also affected the coupé SRi variant, but not the Twin Top. The Astra wagon range was also expanded to include the diesel engine option available already on the hatchback. Although only offered with an automatic transmission, the diesel CDTi wagon marked the return of the Astra wagon to the New Zealand market after its discontinuation after the TS series. 16&quot; wheels became standard equipment on base model Astras.
* MY09: The CD and CDX hatchback and station wagon variants reverted to the black bezel projector-style headlamps. In addition, base model Astras received black B pillars.

=== Specification levels ===

* CD: was the base model with the smaller &quot;Z18XE&quot; engine (later the &quot;Z18XER&quot;)
* CDX: added 16 inch alloy wheels.
* CDXi: versions added adjustable front seats, air conditioning and curtain airbags. Discontinued after MY06.
* CDTi: diesel-powered version of the CDX.
* SRi: was the sport model of the AH series Astra, equipped with leather seats, climate control and 17-inch alloy wheels.
* SRi Turbo: was the larger 2.0-litre &quot;Z20LER&quot; engine.

Special editions
* 60th Anniversary: editions were introduced to commemorate the 60th anniversary since the first Holden, the 48-215 which the Astra was styled after. 60th Anniversary models included 15-inch alloy wheels and steering wheel radio controls.
* CD Equipe: These models gained the 15-inch alloy wheels, and rear power windows at no extra cost during 2006 and 2007.

=== HSV VXR Turbo ===

The Opel Astra OPC (with Vauxhall&#x27;s V-grille and VXR badge) was marketed in Australia as the HSV VXR Turbo by Holden Special Vehicles from 2006 to 2009, fitted with the 177 kW (236 hp) &quot;Z20LEH&quot; engine. In July 2008, HSV released a &quot;Nürburgring&quot; special edition.

A HSV VXR Turbo driven by Dutchman Ivo Breukers and Australians Morgan Haber and Damian Ward, won Class E for &quot;Production (Performance)&quot; cars at the 2013 Liqui Moly 12 Hour in Australia on 10 February. The trio finished 18th outright and covered 229 laps of the 6.213 km (3.861 mi) Mount Panorama Circuit, a total distance of 1,422.77 km (884 mi).
== Sixth generation (PJ; 2015) ==
The sixth generation Astra is based on General Motors&#x27; Delta II platform and went on sale in 2015. The same car was part of a failed attempt by Opel to establish itself in Australia between 2012 and 2013.

The range included the Astra GTC, GTC Sport and VXR three-door hatchbacks, sold at significant lower prices than the preceding Opel models. The VXR featured a turbocharged 2.0 L direct injection engine with a power of and torque of .

=== Holden Astra VXR ===

== Seventh generation (BK, BL; 2016) ==
Holden announced in early 2015 that the fifth-generation Opel Astra will be sold in Australia, from 2016 with the Holden Cruze&#x27;s future uncertain. In late 2015, Holden announced that the Astra and second-generation Cruze will be sold alongside each other. In January 2017 it was revealed that both the Astra and Cruze would be sold together under the Astra nameplate, with Holden taking only the hatch variant of the Opel Astra as the &quot;new Astra hatch,&quot; and the second-generation Cruze sedan imported as the &quot;new Astra sedan.&quot; The Chevrolet Cruze hatch would not be imported by Holden, while the Opel Astra sedan was discontinued starting from the Astra K generation.

The new BK Astra hatch went on sale in December 2016 with three models forming the lineup: R, RS and RS-V. Holden had later added an R+ grade which includes the autonomous safety pack. Only a six-speed manual was available from launch on the 1.6-litre turbo models, with the automatic becoming available in March 2017. A wagon variant of the Astra hatch launched in October 2017, available in LS+ and LT trims, with an exclusive 1.4-litre turbo engine mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. Unlike the Astra hatch and sedan which are produced in Poland and South Korea respectively, the Astra Wagon is produced at Vauxhall&#x27;s Ellesmere Port manufacturing facility in the UK.

The new Cruze-based BL Astra sedan was released in June 2017 with four models forming the lineup, but instead being referred to as LS, LS+, LT and LTZ. Whilst the Astra hatch is available with either 1.4-litre turbo or 1.6-litre turbo engines, the Astra sedan is only available with the 1.4-litre turbo, and the six-speed manual is limited to the base LS model, with all other models having a standard six-speed automatic transmission.

In 2017, Holden released a station wagon to complement the BK Astra hatchback. It was based on the Vauxhall Astra sportwagon sold in the United Kingdom.

On 10 December 2019, Holden announced it would be discontinuing the Astra, (and Commodore), nameplates. They cited a lack of sales drive in each of the respective categories, turning instead to develop their SUV and Ute range.

In late 2019, despite the announcement that Holden would be exiting the market in 2020, the MY20 Astra facelift was announced. For MY20 changes included a revised from bumper and grill, new alloy wheel designs, updated infotainment system, wireless phone charging and a digital instrument cluster. Along with refreshed upholstery and interior trims, a new colour Nautic Blue was added across the range. However, the LED matrix lights offered as an option on pre-facelift cars is no longer available. Instead a static LED headlight is offered as standard on R, RS and RS-V.

;Sales
Sales of the BK Astra commenced in November 2016. Initially being a slow seller, with a manual transmission hatchback being the only model, sales picked up with the 2017 introduction of an automatic transmission, as well as sedan and wagon variants. As of June 2018, Holden announced that the best-selling Astra Sedan variant sales would be ended due to supply issues from the GM Korea&#x27;s Gunsan manufacturing plant, and the Astra Wagon variant sales was to be ended due to slow sales. Both variants remained listed on Holden&#x27;s website until remaining inventory sold out and discontinued entirely.

==Motorsport==
Kelly Racing are competing in the 2019 TCR Australia Touring Car Series with two Holden Astras driven by Chelsea Angelo and Alex Rullo.

<doc id="373900" wikidata="Q310369" url="?curid=373900" title="Freddy Adu">
<text>Fredua Koranteng &quot;Freddy&quot; Adu (born June 2, 1989) is an American former professional soccer player who played as an attacking midfielder. From before the time of his signing with D.C. United at the age of 14, Adu was spoken of as &quot;the next Pelé&quot;. After leaving D.C. United in 2006, he became a journeyman, playing for fifteen teams in nine countries: the United States, Portugal, Monaco, Greece, Turkey, Brazil, Serbia, Finland, and Sweden. The last club he played for was Ettan Fotboll club Österlen FF in 2021.

At D.C. United, Adu broke several records. First, he became the youngest athlete ever to sign a professional contract in the United States at 14 years old, after he was selected by the team in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft in January 2004. Three months later, he became the youngest player to appear in a Major League Soccer (MLS) game when he came on as a substitute in a game against the San Jose Earthquakes. These records have both since been broken by Maximo Carrizo and Cavan Sullivan, respectively.

Adu made his full international debut for the United States national team at the age of 16 in 2006. He went on to earn 17 caps for his country, and was a part of the US squads at the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, as well as at the CONCACAF Gold Cups in 2009 and 2011. He also represented the United States Olympic team at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

==Early life==
Adu was born and raised in the port city of Tema, Ghana, where he played soccer against men three times his age. In 1997, when he was eight, his mother, Emelia Adu, won a green card through the Diversity Immigrant Visa lottery, and his family moved to Rockville, Maryland, in the United States, where he attended Sequoyah Elementary School.

In February 2003, Adu became a United States citizen. Soon after arriving in the United States, he was discovered by a local soccer coach and began playing with boys several years older. Adu attended The Heights School, a private school in Potomac, Maryland, for several years. While playing with the U.S. Olympic Development Program in an under-14 tournament against the youth squads of such traditionally strong Italian teams as Lazio and Juventus, Adu&#x27;s team won the competition, he led the tournament in scoring, and he was named MVP.

==Club career==
===Signing with MLS===
At the age of 14, Adu became the youngest American ever to sign a major league professional contract in any team sport when he was chosen by D.C. United as the number one overall pick in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft. In order to allow Adu to play close to home, MLS assigned him to D.C. United on November 18, 2003, working a deal with the Dallas Burn, who owned the top pick in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft. Dallas was compensated with a player allocation. Having already signed with D.C. United, Adu effectively became the first player selected in that draft, two months before it officially took place. D.C. United had previously signed American youngsters Bobby Convey in 2000 and Santino Quaranta in 2001—both aged 16 and the youngest players in MLS at the times of being drafted.

===D.C. United===

On April 3, Adu came on in United&#x27;s first game of the 2004 season against the San Jose Earthquakes as a second-half substitute, making him the youngest player ever to appear in United States professional sports. On April 17, at the age of fourteen, Adu scored his first professional goal in the 75th minute of a 3–2 away loss against the MetroStars. In doing so, he became the youngest player in MLS history to score a goal. In his first season as a pro, Adu finished the year with five goals and three assists, while playing in all 30 regular season games. Although briefly a starter, Adu was relegated to a substitute when D.C. United acquired central midfielder Christian Gómez mid-season, and it was in this role that he appeared in United&#x27;s MLS Cup victory. He played in three of four playoff games for D.C. United, assisting one goal during that time.

Adu was criticized from a number of different angles in his first season as a professional. Some commentators suggested that Adu was too young to be playing professionally and that he needed more time to develop mentally and physically amongst players his own age. In his second season, he was suspended for one game after he complained about his playing time in the media. During November 2006, Adu had a trial with English club Manchester United for two weeks, but he was not able to gain a work permit and so could not play in any competitive games, and only trained with several players from the Manchester United academy during his two weeks. Continued development, especially of his defensive skills, helped Adu become a starting midfielder during the 2006 season. In addition, Adu had been chosen to take spot kicks during D.C. United&#x27;s two penalty shootouts—scoring on both attempts. He was selected to the MLS All-Star team twice, once as a commissioner&#x27;s choice and once as the coach&#x27;s. He was selected for the Best XI of the 2006 MLS semifinals by &quot;Soccer America&quot; magazine. In 2005, he was nominated for FIFPRO Young player of the year.

====Real Salt Lake====
On December 11, 2006, D.C. United traded Adu and goalkeeper Nick Rimando to Real Salt Lake in exchange for a major allocation, goalkeeper Jay Nolly, and future considerations. Adu made his debut for Real Salt Lake on April 7, 2007, playing the full 90 minutes in a 2–2 draw with FC Dallas. He scored his first goal for the club on May 20, 2007, converting a penalty kick in the 68th minute of a 2–1 loss to FC Dallas. Adu went on to score his second goal with Salt Lake from another penalty in a 1–1 draw in an exhibition against Boca Juniors. Adu was also captain of the U-20 United States men&#x27;s national team in the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup, where he made an impressive showing. After the conclusion of that tournament, Benfica of the Portuguese Liga secured Adu&#x27;s rights from MLS for a transfer fee of $2 million.

===Benfica===
On July 28, 2007, Adu opted out of playing for Real in their regular-season match, and later that day, boarded a plane to Portugal to negotiate with Benfica. On July 30, Benfica issued an official statement announcing that Adu had been transferred to their club. The following day, the signing was completed and he trained with the team in Lisbon. Adu cost Benfica US$2 million. On August 14, 2007, Adu made his debut with Benfica against Copenhagen in a UEFA Champions League qualifying match, coming into the game in the 37th minute as a substitute.

====Loan to AS Monaco====
In July 2008, Adu joined Monégasque club AS Monaco on a season-long loan, with an option to join the Ligue 1 club permanently at the end of the deal, an option that was eventually declined by Monaco. In July 2009, after participating in the Gold Cup game against Honduras, he returned to Benfica for training.

==== Loan to Belenenses ====
Adu was loaned to Portuguese club Belenenses for the 2009–10 season. On October 13, Adu made his first league start in Portugal, a 1–0 loss to Nacional. Adu was injured just before half time, and was substituted. In December 2009 Adu&#x27;s season long loan was cut short.

==== Loan to Aris ====
Adu signed a 12-month loan deal with Greek side Aris in January 2010, joining fellow United States international Eddie Johnson. Assigned squad number 11, Adu made his debut on January 31 and assisted on a 90th-minute goal by Johnson. He scored his first goal on February 14 against Ergotelis.

==== Loan to Çaykur Rizespor ====
On February 1, 2011, Adu moved to Turkish Second Division side Çaykur Rizespor on what was his fourth loan deal away from Benfica. Adu made his debut for his new club on February 20. He set up teammates Mithat Yaşar and Gökhan Kaba with goals in a 3–0 win over Orduspor and was named Man of the Match. Two weeks later, on March 6, Adu scored his first goal for his new club in a 1–0 win over Gaziantep Büyükşehir Belediyespor.

===Philadelphia Union===
After his contract with Benfica expired in August 2011, Adu returned to Major League Soccer, signing with Philadelphia Union, reuniting him with former D.C. United and United States national U-23 coach Piotr Nowak. Though terms were not disclosed, as per club policy, it was stated that he was not a designated player. Adu debuted for Philadelphia Union on August 13 in a match against FC Dallas and scored his first goal for the club on September 7, 2011, against New England Revolution.

===Bahia===
On April 5, 2013, Adu joined Bahia of Brazil. The deal also saw Kléberson move in the opposite direction. He was released by the club on November 7, 2013.

===2014 trials===
After his release from Bahia he started a succession of unsuccessful trials around Europe. In February 2014, Adu began training with Blackpool. At the end of February, they decided against offering Adu a contract, although they gave permission for him to continue training with the club to aid his fitness. In June 2014, Adu began training with Norwegian club Stabæk, managed by former United States national team coach Bob Bradley.
In July 2014, Adu joined Dutch club AZ Alkmaar on trial, but he did not convince the club to offer him a contract.

===Jagodina===
After a trial with AZ that ended without a contract, Adu signed with Serbian club FK Jagodina on July 24, 2014. On July 25, it was announced that Adu had signed a one-and-a-half-year contract with Jagodina. Adu made his debut for Jagodina on September 24, 2014, coming on as a second-half substitute in a Serbian Cup match against FK BSK Borča. This was to be his only first-team appearance for the club. Adu was released by Jagodina, who opted not to renew his six-month contract, on December 21, 2014. Following Adu&#x27;s release from Jagodina, Adu was linked with a move to the Swedish Allsvenskan in February 2015.

===KuPS===
On March 28, 2015, KuPS announced the signing of Adu on a one-year contract, subject to passing a medical. Adu also played some games for KuPS&#x27; reserve team SC Kufu in the Finnish third division. On July 7 of the same year Adu exercised an option in his contract to terminate it.

===Tampa Bay Rowdies===
On July 14, 2015, Tampa Bay Rowdies of the North American Soccer League announced the signing of Adu. Contract details of the signing were not disclosed. It was his 12th professional club. Adu made 13 appearances for the club before being released after the 2016 NASL season.

===Las Vegas Lights FC===
Prior to the 2017 MLS season, Adu went on trial with the Portland Timbers but was not offered a contract. Adu then went on trial with newly promoted Polish Ekstraklasa side Sandecja Nowy Sącz in August 2017. Adu joined the expansion Las Vegas Lights FC on a trial basis prior to the 2018 season. Adu was not selected for either of the team&#x27;s first two preseason matches. He was selected for the third and final preseason match against his former club D.C. United, playing 30 minutes and notching an assist—the first assist recorded in club history and his first in nearly three years—in a 4–2 defeat. On March 15, 2018, Las Vegas added Adu to the regular season roster. Adu made 14 appearances for the Lights and scored one goal for the club during the 2018 campaign. Despite this, Adu was released by Las Vegas at the end of their 2018 season.

=== Österlen FF ===
On October 14, 2020, after a two-year hiatus during which Adu worked as a youth football coach in Maryland, it was announced that Adu had joined Österlen FF, recently promoted to the third tier of Swedish football. After signing with the club, Adu expressed his excitement to play professional soccer again, observing that he &quot;skipped a lot of steps in the past but now he gets a chance to do it right&quot;. On February 16, 2021, after only a month in Sweden, it was announced that Adu&#x27;s contract had been terminated by the Österlen FF administration after the club deemed Adu not being physically or mentally fit enough to be competitive in Ettan. Adu argued that internal conflict within the club was the reason for his exit. Adu told Swedish outlet &quot;Sportbladet&quot; in a written statement: &quot;There is some kind of power struggle going on in the club.&quot; He added: &quot;The coach (Agim Sopi) says that I was signed without his approval, which he does not like. I have been in a similar situation before and it never ends happily. It is better to deal with it immediately.&quot; Österlen manager Agim Sopi told Swedish outlet &quot;Fotbollskanalen&quot;: &quot;He has said that he wants to resume his career and then I think you want to show yourself from your best side, but he was totally untrained when he came here. His physical status was zero.&quot; Sopi further commented on Adu&#x27;s stint at the club, stating: &quot;We gave him a chance a month or so to see. But when you are away for so long. He has barely trained with us. He has had defects all along and I do not see that he has the mental strength required to recover.&quot;

==International career==
===Youth teams===
Adu played for the United States in five international youth tournaments: the 2003 FIFA U-17 World Championship in Finland, the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship in the United Arab Emirates, the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship in the Netherlands, the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Canada, and the 2008 Summer Olympics.

Adu captained the United States under-20 men&#x27;s national team in January 2007 as it qualified for the 2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Canada. By playing in the 2007 tournament finals, held from June to July, Adu became only the second player in the world to play in three FIFA U-20 World Cups. On July 3, 2007, Adu scored a hat-trick in the United States&#x27; 6–1 victory over Poland in the group stage of the tournament. This accomplishment made him the first player to ever score a hat trick in both the under-20 and U-17 World Cups. In the following 2–1 victory over Brazil Adu assisted on both United States goals by Jozy Altidore.

Adu helped lead the under-23 men&#x27;s national team in its campaign to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China. He scored two goals from free kicks in the United States&#x27; 3–0 win over Canada in the semifinals of the tournament, which ultimately qualified them for the Olympics along with Honduras. He scored four goals in total in the three games in which he played, leading all players in scoring, and was selected to the tournament Best XI.

Adu was named to the 18-man squad that represented the United States in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Adu played in the first two games of group play against Japan and Netherlands. He assisted on a Sacha Kljestan goal in the Netherlands match, but he, as well as teammate Michael Bradley, was then suspended for the final game of group play against Nigeria after each player earned his second yellow card of group play late in the Netherlands match. The US team was eliminated from the Olympics after falling to Nigeria.

===Senior team===
Adu was recruited early in his career by the Ghana national team. Although he was open to playing for Ghana, he ultimately decided against it. Adu was called into the United States national team&#x27;s training camp by coach Bruce Arena in January 2006 for a friendly match against Canada. Adu was capped in that game on January 22 (at 16 years and 234 days), becoming the youngest player to appear for the United States national team when he replaced an injured Eddie Johnson in the 81st minute at Torero Stadium in San Diego, California.

Adu made his first start for the senior international team in a friendly against South Africa on November 17, 2007. Adu played in both legs of the 2nd round qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup against Barbados on June 8 and 22, 2008, starting in the latter. He provided the assist on Eddie Lewis&#x27; goal, the lone goal in the 2nd leg of the United States 1–0 victory (9–0 aggregate) in Barbados. Adu scored his first international goal (at 19 years and 170 days) as a member of the full United States national squad from a free kick in a November 19, 2008, World Cup qualifier against Guatemala.

Despite a two-year absence from the national team due to his increasingly unstable club situation, Adu was a shock inclusion in the United States roster for the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup, making the team despite playing for a second division club. After having failed to make an appearance in the team&#x27;s friendly against Spain as well as the first four tournament matches, Adu was a surprise substitute in the semifinal against Panama, coming on in the second half of a scoreless draw for Juan Agudelo. It was Adu&#x27;s pass from mid-field that freed Landon Donovan on a counterattack, where he was able to cross the ball to Clint Dempsey for the winner. Adu started the following game, the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup final vs. Mexico. He had a hand in both of the United States&#x27; goals as they lost 4–2.

<text>The Book of Life is a 1998 film directed by Hal Hartley. In the film, Jesus returns to earth on the eve of the new millennium planning to bring about the apocalypse, but finds himself surprisingly enamored of humanity. It stars Martin Donovan as Jesus, PJ Harvey as Mary Magdalene, and Thomas Jay Ryan as The Devil. Yo La Tengo appear as a Salvation Army band.

==Production==
The film was made for the 2000, Seen By... project, initiated by the French company Haut et Court to produce films depicting the approaching turn of the millennium seen from the perspectives of 10 different countries.

==References==

* ABC &quot;Limelight&quot; magazine, July 2005, quoting Hartley on the D. W. Griffith reference.

<text>The Garibaldi, known historically also as the Catalina goldfish and marine goldfish and now commonly as the Garibaldi damselfish (Hypsypops rubicundus) is a species of bright orange fish in the damselfish family. It occurs in the subtropical northeastern part of the Pacific Ocean. The Garibaldi is the official marine state fish of California, as of 1955, and has since been protected in California coastal waters from recreation and commercial fishing. 

The English name, Garibaldi, is based on an Italian surname and is a reference to the Italian general and political figure Giuseppe Garibaldi, whose followers often wore a characteristic scarlet or red shirt. As is the case in all damselfish, male Garibaldis aggressively defend the nest site after the female lays eggs.

Garibaldi are deep-bodied, or laterally compressed fish, covered in coarse scales. They have a single dorsal fin with about 12 spines and 16 rays.  Adult fish in this species are uniformly bright orange in color. It is the largest member of the damselfish family and can grow up to 35.6 cm (14.02 in) in length. Among Garibaldi there is a sexual size dimorphism, with adult males growing, on average, 25mm larger than females. An unusual trait for damselfish species and other marine fish in southern California, where typically adult females are larger.

Juveniles are a deeper, more reddish shade of orange and are covered in many small iridescent blue stripes and spots, which they gradually lose as they become adults. Their tail (caudal fin) and dorsal fins are more translucent compared to their adult counterparts.

=== Role of Coloration Difference ===
A study conducted by Caron &amp; Rainboth in 1992, found that vibrant colorations reduce aggressive behavior that territorial fish express toward members of their own species, especially during the breeding season. They tested orange and patterned orange (in addition to non-orange) as a stimuli for territorial behavior in Garibaldi. Finding orange to be a very successful stimulus, and that adding disruptive patterns to the color orange counteracts or nullifies the effect of pure orange. Supporting the “intraspecific camouflage” theory, or the idea that the distinct coloration of juvenile Garibaldi allows them to go unrecognized as competitors by the adults. However, Caron &amp; Rainboth only tested the effect of color using blocks of color, would there be the same results with live fish?

A separate study, (Neal, 1993), answers this by conducting preliminary experiments where adult Garibaldi were exposed to live fish with various colorations. Which resulted in the normal-colored juvenile being attacked more (not less as you&#x27;d expect with intraspecific camouflage) than the adult-colored juvenile. A hypothesis known as “adult-habituation” could provide an alternate, theoretical basis for Garibaldi juveniles being more brightly colored than adults. This hypothesis proposes that the vibrant colors of the juveniles help adults get used to their presence more quickly. Particularly when juveniles begin remaining within adult territories, using shelter holes too small for the adults to follow. The idea is that the juvenile coloration works similar to the bright coloration of poisonous organisms. Except instead of facilitating the recognition of a deadly prey, it accelerated Garibaldi adults learning to avoid wasting time and energy chasing after juvenile fish. Allowing juveniles to gradually increase the amount of time it can spend foraging within the adult&#x27;s territory. 

==Distribution and habitat==
Garibaldis are found in water from a depth of up to depth, usually in association with rock reefs, and typically over rocky sea-bottoms. Preferring to live over rocky bottoms on exposed/semi protected coasts with clear water, and plenty of crevices as well as small caves for cover. Juveniles can be found in tide pools and up to depths of 40 feet. This species is native to the north-eastern subtropical parts of the Pacific Ocean, ranging from Monterey Bay, California, to Guadalupe Island, Baja California.

== Biology ==

=== Life History ===
The breeding season for Garibaldi may begin as early as March and continue through July. During this time the male clears a sheltered nest site within his territory; the female then deposits eggs within the nest. When first deposited, the elliptical eggs are bright yellow and turn gray after approximately 5 days.  After fertilizing the eggs, the male guards the nest area until the eggs hatch, which takes 19–21 days, or two to three weeks. Garibaldi have diel patterns of egg-hatching, meaning spawning occurs at regular intervals within a day (24 hours), every day during the spawning season. Embryos hatch within 2 hours after sunset and before early morning, potentially to minimize risk of predation by planktivorous reef fishes. The embryos hatch and disperse as planktonic larvae, eventually reaching the first juvenile stage with a striped blue head and iridescent blue markings over an otherwise translucent orange body. In their juvenile stage, Garibaldi will inhabit tiny crevices, or shelter holes, in their habitat. As they grow older their orange color deepens and they gradually lose their blue markings. Garibaldi will typically achieve adult coloration at around 5 years, and reach sexual maturity at 6 years. The average lifespan is believed to be around 12 years, and for the longest time the maximum age for an individual is 17 years. A newer study, conducted by Williams et al., 2022, collected a Garibaldi with the age of 57 years, making them the longest lived of any species of damselfish by two decades.

=== Diet ===
Classified as generalist omnivores Garibaldi feed mainly on invertebrates, which they remove from the rocks. Their diet also includes a variety of algae and occasionally their own eggs. Garibaldi are found to most commonly feed upon fleshy red algae, polychaete worms, anemones, and sponge fragments. But also have been found to eat encrusting bryozoans, hydroids, branching bryozoans, mollusks, and brown algae. 

=== Predators ===
Adult Garibaldi have very few known natural predators, and are protected by law against fishing. Although Kelp Bass (Paralabrax clathratus) has been reported to prey upon the on young-of-the-year Garibaldi.

=== Parasites and Cleaning Symbiosis ===
Senoritas (Oxyjulis californica) and Kelp Perch (Brachyistius frenatus) remove external parasitic organisms, like bacteria, fungi, copepods, and isopods from Garibaldis. As is the case with other parasitized fish species, Garibaldi will seek out cleaner fishes to remove particular parasites. It has been observed that Garibaldi will often hold their operculum open so that a Senorita can remove gill parasites. The red and white shrimp (Hippolysmata californica) has also been observed removing parasites from Garibaldi.

==Behavior==

=== Territoriality ===
Unlike other damselfish where males guard nest sites only during the mating season, both male and female adult Garibaldi tend to defend year-round territories of about 3-10 square meters, demonstrating a strong attachment to their specific locations. Males are more strict with defense, especially during the breeding season. During the time period that the eggs are developing, the male Garibaldi aggressively tries to keep all other fish away from the eggs, and will boldly attack much larger swimming creatures, including humans, to the point of biting divers in order to try to drive them away from the area where the eggs are deposited. Garibaldi territories include a shelter hole, foraging area, and for adult males, a nest site consisting of perennial patches of red algae cultivated by the male. These territories often share borders, but boundaries are maintained with a little intraspecific aggression but mostly aggression towards other species. Juvenile Garibaldi don&#x27;t tend to be territorial or aggressive toward each other unless they are confined in an aquarium.

=== Female Spawning-Site Selection ===
Females will travel considerable distances during breeding season, encountering courting males and don&#x27;t just spawn automatically with the mate nearest to her territory. She has standards, favoring nests that already contain eggs. Females will selectively spawn with males whose nests contain eggs that are less than three days old, over males with empty nests or those guarding mostly older eggs. They will also always lay their eggs adjacent to younger eggs. Depositing eggs among other females would confer the advantage of reduced risk of predation per egg through the diluting effect (there is a per capita reduction in predation risk when spawning in nests with eggs).

When choosing empty nests, female Garibaldi base their decision on algal growth. They prefer nests with the greatest amount of dense turf algae with short or medium growth. As this may be a reflection of the amount of energy a male devotes to nest tending, serving as an indicator of ability to invest in paternal care and/or parental experience. 

=== Filial Cannibalism ===
Filial cannibalism is when parents consume their own offspring, in this case their eggs. This is a widespread behavior among teleost fish. Male filial cannibalism during the mating phase is believed to be an adaptive response to female spawning-site preference. Since females only lay eggs next to the youngest eggs, if there are older eggs in the front of the nest they can limit the number of additional eggs the male can receive. One way the male can maintain this age gradient the females look for is by selectively cannibalizing the older eggs that are exposed to empty nest space.

== Conservation Status ==
The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists Garibaldi as Least Concern. Due in part to the species being widespread in the Eastern Pacific, common in many parts of its range with no major threats, and no current indication of population decline.

A brand new study Fuentes Calderon et al., 2024, has data that shows correlated patterns between sea surface temperature across islands and the relationship between diet composition and habitat type. It is hard to find direct evidence of habitat-related differences in the ecological performance of marine fishes, but this knowledge can be critically important in the future design and assessment of projects that may add or remove reef habitats in the ocean.

==In aquarium==
It is peaceful during the juvenile period. But as long as the body is slightly larger, it will show territorial rights to other meek fish and compete with other small fish for territory.

<doc id="373910" wikidata="Q125564574" url="?curid=373910" title="Full Service Network">
<text>Full Service Network, also known as FSN was an 18-month trial interactive television service launched by Time Warner Inc. in Orlando, Florida. The FSN was active between 1994 and 1997 targeting an initial number of 4,000 households with services that ranged from video-on-demand to ordering fast food using just the TV remote. At its time, it was dubbed the &quot;most futuristic network introduced so far.&quot;

The trial aimed to study how interactive services would work, as well as their costs and advertising capabilities. It also aimed to find out &quot;what people will want when the equipment that is now so expensive becomes affordable several years down the road.&quot;

== Concept ==
Time Warner&#x27;s Full Service Network was described as &quot;the first in the world to integrate emerging cable, computer, and telephone technologies over a fiber-optic and coaxial cable network.&quot; This meant that the service offered traditional cable, interactive television, telephone services, and high-speed PC access to on-line services.

Regardless of its first-time advantages, the FSN was not television&#x27;s first attempt at interactivity, nor was it Time Warner Cable&#x27;s first attempt. Previous efforts included 1977&#x27;s QUBE, a service offered by Warner-Amex (a joint venture between Warner Cable and American Express) initially in Columbus, OH, then expanding into cities such as Dallas, and Pittsburgh; as well as the 1950s children television show &quot;Winky Dink and You&quot;, which prompted interactivity through the use of plastics &#x27;Magic Screens&#x27; that parents would place on the actual television display so kids could draw on them.

However, the FSN&#x27;s service was very similar to 2008 interactive services. Users would be plugged into the network using set top boxes and selecting the offerings of their choice using just the remote control. The drawback: the cost of set top-boxes was extremely high in the 1990s (over $1000.)

According to Gerald M. Levin, chairman and CEO of Time Warner at the time, the FSN was part of the company&#x27;s strategy for driving the growth of its copyright businesses:

== History ==
The FSN&#x27;s first households were plugged-in in December 1994 in Orlando, Florida.

According to the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, the city of Orlando was chosen because of its worry-free weather, the fact that it was Time Warner Cable&#x27;s second largest division and because it already featured fiber-optic network installations (which would reduce implementation costs.) The city&#x27;s high growth demographics, with large percentages of households with children, complemented the decision.

The specific test area was suburban Orlando, including southwest Seminole County and parts of Orange County (Wekiva, Sweetwater, Lake Brantley, and Spring Lake Hills).

Available interactive services were added to the network bit by bit. They included on-demand games, sports and movies, food ordering, and also local information, events and shopping opportunities through GOtv, an interactive entertainment guide.

GOtv worked in association with other media, such as The Orlando Sentinel, in compiling reviews and other information on restaurants, their menus, prices, location and hours.

In 1996, the services of FSN were made available for the general public to check out at Walt Disney World&#x27;s Epcot Center Innoventions expo, where &quot;Five stations are available for guests to interact with the television through the network&#x27;s Carousel(tm) navigator.&quot;

Michael Colglazier, General Manager of Innoventions, qualified the technology as life changing, and was very pleased to offer the Disney&#x27;s guests a chance to experience it.

The Orlando Business Journal announced in 1997 the closing of the Full Service Network. The article listed as the reason Time Warner&#x27;s shifting emphasis toward an evolved form of the technology being developed by outside companies under contract with Time Warner Cable.

The company had 156 employees at the time at its main office in Maitland.

== Partner services ==
Hewlett-Packard was one of the early partners of the FSN, which was also the only trial to offer full-page, color printing for interactive television.

HP participated &quot;to learn about the printing and order fulfillment needs of interactive-TV users, service providers and advertisers&quot;.

The service aimed to offer users the possibility to print out the information available in the FSN&#x27;s interactive guides, as well as the map locations for shops and restaurants, or ticket events.

As for pizza, Pizza Hut was the FSN partner. The service offered users the chance to order pizza, drinks and other products from the chain&#x27;s menu using their remote.

This, according to Pizza Hut&#x27;s spokesperson, Chris Romoser, represented an advantage for everyone involved: users had to press fewer buttons on their remote control than they would have to dialing for delivery, and less restaurant-employee time will be required for the completion of the ordering process.

According to Tom Feige, president of the FSN:Pizza Hut is a great example of how FSN customers not only watch television, they use television as well. The future of television lies in its potential to give users greater choice, convenience and control of their viewing habits and consumer activities.

<text>Ardolph Loges Kline (February 21, 1858 – October 13, 1930) was an American politician and New York National Guard officer who became acting Mayor of New York City on September 10, 1913, upon the death of Mayor William Jay Gaynor, serving for the rest of the year. He was later a United States representative from Brooklyn (1921–1923).

==Biography==
Kline was born near Newton, New Jersey, in 1858 and studied at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, but did not attend college. In 1876 and 1877, he started working for a men&#x27;s clothing company in New York City and joined the New York National Guard as a private. When the Spanish–American War of 1898 began, he was named a Lieutenant-Colonel, and in 1901 a Brevet (honorary or acting) Brigadier-General.

===Political career===
After losing a campaign for Sheriff of Kings County (Brooklyn), Kline was elected as an Alderman for the 51st District in Brooklyn in 1903 and 1905, but lost re-election in 1907 due to Democratic redrawing of his district. He won back his seat in 1911 and became vice-chairman of the Board of Aldermen in 1912, promising to enforce all rules fairly from the chair (including those against smoking).

When John P. Mitchel, the elected President of the Board of Aldermen, resigned in 1912 in order to become Collector of the Port of New York, Kline succeeded Mitchel. And when Mayor Gaynor (who had never fully recovered from an attempted assassination in 1910) died at sea in September 1913, Board President Kline became mayor.

He served out the remainder of Gaynor&#x27;s term, leaving office on December 31, 1913. Despite his stated intention of keeping all the department heads appointed by his predecessor for the rest of his term, Kline, in his very last days of office, dismissed Rhinelander Waldo as Commissioner of Police rather than accept a New Year&#x27;s Eve resignation.

Although re-elected as alderman for his old district for the 1914–1915 term, Kline resigned in early January 1914 to begin four years as the city&#x27;s Tax Commissioner for Brooklyn (reviewing appeals of property tax assessments).

He later served as a Republican U.S. Representative from New York (5th District in Brooklyn) from 1921 to 1923, being named to the House Committee on Naval Affairs, but lost re-election in 1922 to Loring M. Black, Jr. (Democratic, 1923–1935). Kline spent all of his post-Congressional life as New York manager of the sea-service bureau of the United States Shipping Board.

Kline died October 13, 1930, at the Methodist Episcopal Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, and was buried in Holy Cross Cemetery.

==Legacy==
He is still (in early 2016) the only mayor of the consolidated (post-1897) city never to have won a citywide popular election to any office (such as those from which Joseph V. McKee and Vincent Impellitteri rose to become acting mayor). On the other hand, Kline is also the last serving or former mayor to win election to any other public office.

==Congressional election returns==
Here are the election returns from the Fifth Congressional District in Brooklyn for 1920–1922, as reported by William Tyler Page, the Clerk of the United States House of Representatives. The sitting Democratic Representative, John B. Johnston (1919–21), did not seek re-election in 1920.
* &quot;(1920 was a landslide election year for the Republicans under President Warren G. Harding, but in the statewide elections of 1922, without such a national race, the New York City Democrats Al Smith and Royal Copeland easily unseated Republican Governor Nathan L. Miller and Republican U.S. Senator William M. Calder.)&quot;

<doc id="373917" wikidata="Q917144" url="?curid=373917" title="Philistinism">
<text>In the fields of philosophy and of aesthetics, the term philistinism describes the attitudes, habits, and characteristics of a person who deprecates art, beauty, spirituality, and intellect. As a derogatory term, philistine describes a person who is narrow-minded and hostile to the life of the mind, whose materialistic and wealth-oriented worldview and tastes indicate an indifference to cultural and aesthetic values.

The contemporary meaning of &quot;philistine&quot; derives from Matthew Arnold&#x27;s adaptation to English of the German word Philister, as applied by university students in their antagonistic relations with the townspeople of Jena, early modern Germany, where a riot resulted in several deaths in 1689. Preaching about the riot, Georg Heinrich Götze, the ecclesiastical superintendent, applied the word &quot;Philister&quot; in his sermon analysing the social class hostilities between students and townspeople. Götze addressed the town-vs-gown matter with an admonishing sermon, &quot;The Philistines Be Upon Thee&quot;, drawn from the Book of Judges (Chapt. , Samson vs the Philistines), of the Old Testament.

== History ==
In German usage, university students applied the term &quot;Philister&quot; (Philistine) to describe a person who was not trained at university; in the social context of early modern Germany, the term identified the man (&quot;Philister&quot;) and woman (&quot;Philisterin&quot;) who was not from the university.

In Britain, the term &quot;philistine&quot;—a person hostile to aesthetic and intellectual discourse—was in common use by the 1820s, and was applied to the bourgeois, materialistic, merchant middle class of the Victorian Era (1837–1901), whose newly acquired social status and wealth rendered some of them hostile to cultural traditions which favored aristocratic power. Regarding the philistines, Matthew Arnold wrote in &quot;Culture and Anarchy: An Essay in Political and Social Criticism&quot; (1869):

==Usages==


The denotations and connotations of the terms &quot;philistinism&quot; and &quot;philistine&quot; describe people who are hostile to art, culture, and the life of the mind, and, in their stead, favor economic materialism and conspicuous consumption as paramount human activities.

;17th century
Whilst involved in a lawsuit, the writer and poet Jonathan Swift (1667–1745), in the slang of his time, described a gruff bailiff as a philistine, someone who is considered a merciless enemy.

;18th century
The polymath Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832) described the philistine personality, by asking:

Goethe described such men and women, by noting that:

In the comedy of manners play, &quot;The Rivals&quot; (1775), Richard Brinsley Sheridan (1751–1816) identifies a violent aristocrat as &#x27;that bloodthirsty Philistine, Sir Lucius O&#x27;Trigger&#x27;.

;19th century

Thomas Carlyle often wrote of gigs and &quot;gigmanity&quot; as a sign of classist materialism; Arnold recognized Carlyle&#x27;s use of the term as being synonymous with philistine. Carlyle used &quot;philistine&quot; to describe William Taylor in 1831. He also used it in &quot;Sartor Resartus&quot; (1833–34) and in &quot;The Life of John Sterling&quot; (1851), remembering conversations where &quot;Philistines would enter, what we call bores, dullards, Children of Darkness&quot;.

The composer Robert Schumann (1810-1856) created Davidsbündler, a fictional society whose purpose is to fight the philistines. This fight appears in some of his musical pieces, such as &quot;Davidsbündlertänze&quot;, Op. 6, and the concluding part of his &quot;Carnaval&quot;, op. 9, which is titled &quot;Marche des Davidsbündler contre les Philistins&quot;.

In &quot;The Sickness Unto Death&quot; (1849), the philosopher Søren Kierkegaard criticises the spiritlessness of the philistine-bourgeois mentality of triviality and the self-deception of despair.

The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) identified the philistine as a person who, for a lack of true cultural unity, can only define style in the negative and through cultural conformity. The essay &quot;David Strauss: the Confessor and the Writer&quot; in &quot;Untimely Meditations&quot; is an extended critique of nineteenth-century German Philistinism.

;20th century
* In the novel &quot;Der Ewige Spießer&quot; (The Eternal Philistine, 1930), the Austro–Hungarian writer Ödön von Horváth (1901–38) derided the cultural coarseness of the philistine man and his limited view of the world. The eponymous philistine is a failed businessman, a salesman of used cars, who aspires to the high-life of wealth; to realise that aspiration, he seeks to meet a rich woman who will support him, and so embarks upon a rail journey from Munich to Barcelona to seek her at the World&#x27;s Fair.
* In the &quot;Lectures on Russian Literature&quot; (1981), in the essay &#x27;Philistines and Philistinism&#x27; the writer Vladimir Nabokov (1899–1977) describes the philistine man and woman as:

* In the &quot;Lectures on Literature&quot; (1982), in speaking of the novel &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; (1856), about the bourgeois wife of a country doctor, Nabokov said that philistinism is manifest in the prudish attitude demonstrated by the man or the woman who accuses a work of art of being obscene.

<doc id="373920" wikidata="Q963539" url="?curid=373920" title="List of mayors of Detroit">
<text>This is a list of [[mayor]]s of [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]. See History of Detroit, for more information about the history of the incorporation of the city.

The current mayor is Mike Duggan, who was sworn into office on January 1, 2014.

==History of Detroit&#x27;s executive authority==
During the earliest part of its history, Detroit was a military outpost, and executive authority was wielded by first French, then British military commandants. Soon after the Detroit area was taken over by American forces, civil authority became more prominent, and executive authority was placed in the hands of a series of appointed officials, elected boards, and elected officials. This included a brief stint in 1806–1809 with a largely ceremonial mayor.

Detroit&#x27;s current strong mayor system dates from the city&#x27;s 1824 charter. From 1824 to 1857, mayors were elected to terms of one year; from 1858 to 1953 the term was increased to two years, and after 1953 mayoral terms were four years.

===Early French and British leadership===
During the early part of Detroit&#x27;s existence, local authority was vested in French and British military commandants. French commandants included:
* Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac (1701–1710)
* (1710–1714)
* Jacques-Charles Renaud Dubuisson (1714)
* Pierre Alphonse de Tonty (1717–1727)
* (1728–1729)
* , Sieur de Boishebert (1730–1733)
* (1733–1736)
* , Sieur de Charvis (1739–1742)
* Pierre Joseph Celoron (1742–1744)
* Paul Joseph le Moyne, Chevalier de Longueuil (1744–1748)
* Pierre Joseph Celoron (second term, 1750–1754)
* (1754–1758)
* Francois Marie Picote, Sieur de Belestre (1758–1760)

Seventeen British commandants led Detroit between 1760 and 1796.
* Major Robert Rogers (1760)
* Captain Donald Campbell (1760–1762)
* Major Henry Gladwin (1762–1764)
* Colonel John Bradstreet (1764)
* Lieutenant-Colonel John Campbell (1765–1766)
* George Turnbull (1766–1769)
* Captain James Stephenson (1770–1772)
* Captain George Etherington (1772) 
* Major Henry Bassett (1772–1774)
* Captain Richard Beringer Lernoult (1774–1779)
* Colonel Arent Schuyler de Peyster (1779–1784)
* Major William Ancrum (1785–1786)
* Thomas Bennett (1786)
* Captain Robert Matthews (1787–1788)
* Major Patrick Murray (1788–1790)
* Major John Smith (1790–1792)
* Colonel Richard England (1792–1796)

===Early American leadership===
When Detroit was turned over to the Americans in 1796, Colonel Jean François Hamtramck was named commander of Detroit, a position he held until his death in 1803.

The first local rule of Detroit was established in 1802, when Detroit was incorporated as a town. The original incorporation provided for a board of trustees to govern the town, the chairman of which was the highest governmental position. The first chairman of the board, appointed on February 9, 1802, was James Henry. Henry was elected to the position later in the year. Subsequent elections were held in May of each year, with the chairmen of the Board of Trustees being:
* James Henry (1802–1803)
* James May (1803–1804)
* Solomon Sibley (1804–1805) 
* Joseph Wilkinson (elected 1805)

===1806 charter===
In 1805, a massive fire destroyed the town and effectively eliminated the government. Governor William Hull and Judge Augustus Woodward dissolved the original incorporation, replacing it in 1806 with a government headed by an appointed mayor. However, the position was largely honorary, and the two men who held it (Solomon Sibley and Elijah Brush) each quickly resigned upon realizing the lack of power in the office. The legislation creating this mayoral position was repealed in 1809, after which &quot;de facto&quot; political power still resided with Hull and Woodward, and Detroit was without either a mayor or board of trustees until after the War of 1812.

===Second Board of Trustees===
After the war, a legislative act in 1815 ended the interregnum and returned political control to the citizens of Detroit through a Board of Trustees, elected yearly. In October of that year, Solomon Sibley was elected as the first chair. The chairs elected yearly to this Board were:
* Solomon Sibley (1815–1816)
* George McDougall (1816–1817)
* Abraham Edwards (1817–1818)
* John R. Williams (1818–1819)
* James McCloskey (1819–1820)
* James Abbott (1820–1821)
* Andrew G. Whitney (1821–1822; 1822–1823)
* James Abbott (second term, 1823–1824)

===1824 charter===
In 1824, John R. Williams drew up a new city charter that provided for the first time for a directly elected mayor, with significantly increased executive powers. Following approval by the state legislature, Williams became the City of Detroit&#x27;s first elected mayor.

===1918 charter and nonpartisan elections===
In June 1918 Detroit&#x27;s first home-rule city charter came into effect, following passage by city voters in a referendum. The new charter mandated that all Detroit public offices be non-partisan, and that elections to those positions would be held on a non-partisan basis, with no party designations on the ballot. These provisions have been continued through all subsequent city charter revisions.

Since 1918, all mayoral elections in Detroit have been held on a non-partisan basis, and mayors have officially served unaffiliated with any political party. Thus, the party affiliations given in the chart below for mayors elected after 1918 are not official and are based on the inferences of editors based on available historic information.

===Official residence===
Since 1966, the official residence of the Mayor of Detroit has been the Manoogian Mansion, located on Dwight Street in the Berry Subdivision Historic District, facing the Detroit River on the city&#x27;s east side. The mansion was donated to the city by industrialist Alex Manoogian, founder of the Masco Corporation.

==First incorporation==
Two mayors served under the 1806 charter.
==Reincorporation==
The following mayors served under the stronger executive mayoral system begun in the 1824 charter:
==Non-partisan elections==
A new city charter went into effect in 1918, which required that all city offices be non-partisan. The following mayors were elected in non-partisan elections with no party designations on the ballot, and served on a non-partisan basis with no official party affiliation: This provision has been repeated in the subsequent city charters of 1974, 1997, and 2012: So, the party affiliations shown below are based on information from each mayor&#x27;s personal and/or political history and do not represent any official status.

<text>The Golden Spike (also known as The Last Spike) is the ceremonial 17.6-karat gold final spike driven by Leland Stanford to join the rails of the first transcontinental railroad across the United States connecting the Central Pacific Railroad from Sacramento and the Union Pacific Railroad from Omaha on May 10, 1869, at Promontory Summit, Utah Territory. The term &quot;last spike&quot; has been used to refer to one driven at the usually ceremonial completion of any new railroad construction projects, particularly those in which construction is undertaken from two disparate origins towards a common meeting point. The spike is now displayed in the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University.

==History==
Completing the last link in the transcontinental railroad with a spike of gold was the brainchild of David Hewes, a San Francisco financier and contractor. The spike had been manufactured earlier that year especially for the event by the William T. Garratt Foundry in San Francisco. Two of the sides were engraved with the names of the railroad officers and directors. A special tie of polished California laurel was chosen to complete the line where the spike would be driven. The ceremony was originally to be held on May 8, 1869 (the date actually engraved on the spike), but it was postponed two days because of bad weather and a labor dispute that delayed the arrival of the Union Pacific side of the rail line.
On May 10, in anticipation of the ceremony, Union Pacific No. 119 and Central Pacific No. 60 (better known as the &quot;Jupiter&quot;) locomotives were drawn up face-to-face on Promontory Summit. It is unknown how many people attended the event; estimates run from as low as 500 to as many as 3,000; government and railroad officials and track workers were present to witness the event.

Before the last spike was driven, three other commemorative spikes, presented on behalf of the other three members of the Central Pacific&#x27;s Big Four who did not attend the ceremony, had been driven in the pre-bored laurel tie:
* a second, lower-quality gold spike, supplied by the San Francisco &quot;News Letter&quot;, was made of $200 worth of gold and inscribed: &quot;With this spike the San Francisco News Letter offers its homage to the great work which has joined the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.&quot;
* a silver spike, supplied by the State of Nevada; forged, rather than cast, of of unpolished silver.
* a blended iron, silver and gold spike, supplied by the Arizona Territory, engraved: &quot;Ribbed with iron clad in silver and crowned with gold Arizona presents her offering to the enterprise that has banded a continent and dictated a pathway to commerce.&quot; This spike was given to Union Pacific President Oliver Ames following the ceremony. The spike was donated to the Museum of the City of New York in 1943, by a descendant of Sidney Dillon. It was, for a time, on display at the Union Pacific Railroad Museum in Council Bluffs, Iowa. The Museum of the City of New York sold the spike in January 2023, via auction, to benefit other items in its collection. The winning bid totaled million

The golden spike was made of 17.6-karat (73%) copper-alloyed gold, and weighed . It was dropped into a pre-drilled hole in the laurel ceremonial last tie, and gently tapped into place with a silver ceremonial spike maul. The spike was engraved on all four sides:
* &quot;The Pacific Railroad ground broken January 8, 1863, and completed May 8, 1869.&quot;
* &quot;Directors of the C. P. R. R. of Cal. Hon. Leland Stanford. C. P. Huntington. E. B. Crocker. Mark Hopkins. A. P. Stanford. E. H. Miller Jr.&quot;
* &quot;Officers. Hon. Leland Stanford. Presdt. C. P. Huntington Vice Presdt. E. B. Crocker. Atty. Mark Hopkins. Tresr. Chas Crocker Gen. Supdt. E. H. Miller Jr. Secty. S. S. Montague. Chief Engr.&quot;
* &quot;May God continue the unity of our Country, as this Railroad unites the two great Oceans of the world. Presented by David Hewes San Francisco.&quot;
The spike was removed immediately after being hammered in to prevent it from being stolen. A second golden spike, exactly like the one from the ceremony (except for the date), was cast at the same time, and probably engraved at a later time with the correct Promontory date of May 10, 1869. It has been noted that the first Golden Spike engraving appeared &quot;rushed&quot;, and the Hewes family spike lettering appeared more polished. It was held, unknown to the public, by the Hewes family until 2005. This second spike is now on permanent display, along with Thomas Hill&#x27;s famous painting &quot;The Last Spike&quot;, at the California State Railroad Museum in Sacramento.

With the locomotives drawn so near, the crowd pressed so closely around Stanford and the other railroad officials that the ceremony became somewhat disorganized, leading to varying accounts of the actual events. &quot;On the Union Pacific side, thrusting westward, the last two rails were laid by Irishmen; on the Central Pacific side, thrusting eastward, the last two rails were laid by the Chinese!&quot; A.J. Russell stereoview No. 539 shows the &quot;Chinese at Laying Last Rail UPRR&quot;. Eight Chinese workers laid the last rail, and three of these men, Ging Cui, Wong Fook, and Lee Shao, lived long enough to also participate in the 50th anniversary parade. At the conclusion of the ceremony, the participating Chinese workers were honored and cheered by the CPRR officials and that road&#x27;s construction chief, J.H. Strobridge, at a dinner in his private car.

To drive the final spike, Stanford lifted a silver spike maul and drove the spike into the tie, completing the line. Stanford and Hewes missed the spike, but the single word &quot;done&quot; was nevertheless flashed by telegraph around the country. In the United States, the event has come to be considered one of the first nationwide media events. The locomotives were moved forward until their cowcatchers met, and photographs were taken. Immediately afterwards, the golden spike and the laurel tie were removed, lest they be stolen, and replaced with a regular iron spike and normal tie. At exactly 12:47 pm, the last iron spike was driven, finally completing the line.

After the ceremony, the Golden Spike was donated to the Stanford Museum (now Cantor Arts Center) in 1898. The last laurel tie was destroyed in the fires caused by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. A replica of the laurel tie, dedicated in late 2024, is on display in the Gravity Car Barn Museum on Mount Tamalpais.


==Aftermath==
Although the Promontory event marked the completion of the transcontinental railroad from Omaha to Sacramento on May 10, 1869, it did not mark the completion of the Pacific Railroad &quot;from the Missouri river to the Pacific&quot; authorized by the Pacific Railroad Acts, much less a seamless coast-to-coast rail network: neither Sacramento nor Omaha was a seaport, nor did they have rail connections until after they were designated as the termini. Western Pacific completed the westernmost transcontinental leg from Sacramento to San Francisco Bay on September 6, 1869, with the last spike at the Mossdale Bridge across the San Joaquin River near Lathrop, California. The official completion date of the Pacific Railroad as called for by Section 6 of the Pacific Railroad Act of 1862, et seq. was determined to be November 6, 1869, by the US Supreme Court in Part I of the Court&#x27;s &quot;Opinion and Order&quot; dated January 27, 1879, in re &quot;Union Pacific Railroad vs. United States&quot; (99 U.S. 402).

Passengers were required to cross the Missouri River between Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Omaha, Nebraska, by boat until the building of the Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge in March 1872. In the meantime, a coast-to-coast rail link was achieved in August 1870 in Strasburg, Colorado, by the completion of the Denver extension of the Kansas Pacific Railway.

In 1904 a new railroad route called the Lucin Cutoff was built by-passing the Promontory location to the south. By going west across the Great Salt Lake from Ogden, Utah, to Lucin, Utah, the new railroad line shortened the distance by 43 miles and avoided curves and grades. Main line trains no longer passed over Promontory Summit.

In 1942, the old rails over Promontory Summit were salvaged for the war effort; the event was marked by a ceremonial &quot;undriving&quot; of the last iron spike. The original event had been all but forgotten except by local residents, who erected a commemorative marker in 1943. The following year a commemorative postage stamp was issued to mark the 75th anniversary. The years after the war saw a revival of interest in the event; the first re-enactment was staged in 1948.

In 1957, Congress established the Golden Spike National Historic Site to preserve the area around Promontory Summit as closely as possible to its appearance in 1869. O&#x27;Connor Engineering Laboratories in Costa Mesa, California, designed and built working replicas of the locomotives present at the original ceremony for the Park Service. These engines are drawn up face-to-face each Saturday during the summer for a re-enactment of the event.

For the May 10, 1969, centennial of the driving of the last spike, the High Iron Company ran a steam-powered excursion train round trip from New York City to Promontory. The Golden Spike Centennial Limited transported over 100 passengers including, for the last leg into Salt Lake City, actor John Wayne. The Union Pacific Railroad also sent a special display train and the US Army Transportation Corps sent a steam-powered 3-car special from Fort Eustis, Virginia.

On May 10, 2006, on the anniversary of the driving of the spike, Utah announced that its state quarter design would be a depiction of the driving of the spike. The Golden Spike design was selected as the winner from among several others by Utah&#x27;s governor, Jon Huntsman Jr., following a period during which Utah residents voted and commented on their favorite of three finalists.

On May 10, 2019, the United States Postal Service issued a set of three new commemorative postage stamps to mark the 150th anniversary of the driving of the golden spike: one stamp for the Jupiter locomotive, one stamp for locomotive #119, and one stamp for the golden spike.

It remains a common myth that Chinese workers are not visible in the famous A.J. Russell &quot;champagne photo&quot; of the last spike ceremony. Many Chinese workers were absent from the Golden Spike ceremony in 1869 despite their tremendous contribution in the completion of the railroad. Over 12,000 Chinese had labored to build the rail line from the west, 80% of the railroad workers were Chinese. On the 145th anniversary of the Golden Spike ceremony, Corky Lee gathered 200+ Chinese, Chinese Americans and other Asian Pacific Americans groups to create what he called &quot;photographic justice&quot;. Research done by Stanford&#x27;s &quot;Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project&quot; disproved the myth, identifying two Chinese laborers who were photographed in the famous A.J. Russell shot. More Chinese laborers who attended the last spike ceremony are also visible in A.J. Russell&#x27;s &quot;stereo view # 539 Chinese at Laying Last Rail UPRR,&quot; although the Chinese laborers who attended the ceremony still only represented a small fraction of the total Chinese workforce on the railroad.

Three of the Chinese workers who helped build the railroad in 1869, Wong Fook, Lee Chao, and Ging Cui would be given a place in the celebratory 50th anniversary parade at Ogden, Utah, in 1919. However, during the 1969 ceremony no Chinese representatives spoke during the dedication of a plaque memorializing Chinese railroad workers. The 2019 ceremony brought an intentionally greater focus on the Chinese contribution with Elaine Chao then United States Secretary of Transportation speaking at the event. The Chinese Railway Workers Descendants Association continues to hold annual gatherings at Chinese Arch near Promontory. A monument dedicated to Chinese workers on the railroad was installed at the Utah State capitol building to correspond with the 155th anniversary.

A Utah state park, planned to celebrate the Golden Spike opening in Brigham City, Utah in 2025, will feature a 43 foot tall statue depicting the Golden Spike. The statue, mounted on the back of a truck; has toured various parts of America throughout 2023 and 2024.

==Golden Spike Days Celebration (1939)==
An elaborate four-day event called the Golden Spike Days Celebration was held in Omaha, Nebraska, from April 26 to 29, 1939, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the joining of the UP and CPRR rails and driving of the Last Spike at Promontory Summit, Utah, in 1869. The center piece event of the celebration occurred on April 28 with the world premiere of the Cecil B. DeMille feature motion picture &quot;Union Pacific&quot; which took place simultaneously in the city&#x27;s Omaha, Orpheum, and Paramount theaters. The film features an elaborate reenactment of the original Golden Spike ceremony (filmed in Canoga Park, California) as the motion picture&#x27;s closing scene for which DeMille borrowed the actual Golden Spike from Stanford University to be held by Dr. W.H. Harkness (Stanley Andrews) as he delivered his remarks prior to its driving to complete the railroad. (A prop spike was used for the actual hammering sequence.)
Also included as a part of the overall celebration&#x27;s major attractions was the Golden Spike Historical Exposition, a large assemblage of artifacts (including the Golden Spike itself), tools, equipment, photographs, documents, and other materials from the construction of the Pacific Railroad that were put on display at Omaha&#x27;s Municipal Auditorium. The four days of events drew over 250,000 people to Omaha during its run, a number roughly equivalent to the city&#x27;s then population. The celebration was opened by President Franklin D. Roosevelt who inaugurated it by pressing a telegraph key at the White House in Washington, DC.

On the same day as the premiere of the movie, a still standing gold-colored concrete spike called the &quot;Golden Spike Monument,&quot; measuring some in height, was unveiled at 21st Street and 9th Avenue in Council Bluffs, Iowa, adjacent to the UP&#x27;s main yard, the location of milepost 0.0 of that road&#x27;s portion of the Pacific Railroad.

==In popular culture==

===Artwork===
* In 2012, Artist Greg Stimac used the original &quot;golden spike&quot;, on display at the Cantor Arts Center at Stanford University, to produce a series of photograms, or cameraless photographs.

===Films===
* The first motion picture depiction of the driving of the golden spike occurred in &quot;The Iron Horse&quot; (1924), a silent film directed by John Ford and produced by Fox Film. In 2011, this film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry.
* In the fictional action comedy film &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; (1999), the joining ceremony is the setting of an assassination attempt on then U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant by the film&#x27;s antagonist Dr. Arliss Loveless. (In reality Grant did not attend the Golden Spike ceremony.) The extensive Promontory Summit set for the film&#x27;s Golden Spike ceremony scenes was built at the 20,000-acre Cook&#x27;s Ranch near Santa Fe, New Mexico.

===Television===
* The &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Showdown&quot; features an extended flashback taking place in the Utah Territory in 1883, with the territorial governor (voiced by Patrick Leahy) presiding over the ceremony to drive home the Golden Spike, before they are interrupted by an aerial attack by Ra&#x27;s al Ghul. In reality, 1883 was the year in which the southern section of the Southern Pacific railroad (the &quot;second&quot; transcontinental line) was completed; the completion ceremony took place in Texas rather than Utah, and the ceremonial spikes driven were silver, not gold.
* &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot; presents a multi-season arc on the construction of the transcontinental railroad. In Season 5, Episode 11, a flash forward sequence includes a picture of the railroad ceremony and a main character claiming to possess a ring made of gold crafted from part of the ceremonial golden spike.
* In Syfy original series &quot;Warehouse 13&quot;, the gold spike is featured as an artifact. It was used by Pete &amp; Myka to temporarily negate the effects of the Rhodes Bowl. Later, the spike became stuck within the Warehouse&#x27; expansion joints as it expanded to accommodate additional artifacts.

===Trains===
* The &quot;Inyo&quot;, a 4-4-0 steam locomotive built for the Virginia &amp; Truckee Railroad (V&amp;T #22) in 1875 by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Philadelphia, appeared in both the Golden Spike ceremony scene in &quot;Union Pacific&quot; (1939) and in the 1960s TV series &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;. It also briefly appears as the Jupiter in &quot;Go West&quot;. In May 1969, the &quot;Inyo&quot; participated in the Golden Spike Centennial at Promontory, Utah, and then served as the replica of the Central Pacific&#x27;s &quot;Jupiter&quot; (CPRR #60) at the Golden Spike National Historical Site, until the current replica was built in 1979. Purchased by the Nevada State Railroad Museum in Carson City, Nevada, in 1974, it was eventually brought back to Nevada and fully restored there in 1983, where it still runs today.

<text>The &quot;American Dream&quot; is a phrase referring to a purported national ethos of the United States: that every person has the freedom and opportunity to succeed and attain a better life. The phrase was popularized by James Truslow Adams during the Great Depression in 1931, and has had different meanings over time. Originally, the emphasis was on democracy, liberty, and equality, but more recently has been on achieving material wealth and upward social mobility.

Adams defined it as 

The tenets of the American Dream originate from the Declaration of Independence, which states that &quot;all men are created equal&quot;, and have an inalienable right to &quot;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&quot;. The Preamble to the Constitution states similarly that the Constitution&#x27;s purpose is to, in part, &quot;secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity&quot;. It is said to be a set of ideals including representative democracy, rights, liberty, and equality, in which freedom is interpreted as the opportunity for individual prosperity and success, as well as the chance for upward social mobility for each according to ability and achievement through hard work in a capitalist society with many challenges but few formal barriers.

Evidence indicates that in recent decades social mobility in the United States has declined, and income inequality has risen. Social mobility is lower in the US than in many European countries, especially the Nordic countries. Despite this, many Americans are likely to believe they have a better chance of social mobility than Europeans do. The US ranked 27th in the 2020 Global Social Mobility Index. A 2020 poll found 54% of American adults thought the American Dream was attainable for them, while 28% thought it was not. Black and Asian Americans, and younger generations were less likely to believe this than whites, Hispanics, Native Americans and older generations. Women are more skeptical of achieving the American Dream than men are.

Belief in the American Dream is often inversely associated with rates of national disillusionment. Some critics have said that the dominant culture in America focuses on materialism and consumerism, or puts blame on the individual for failing to achieve success. Others have said that the labor movement is significant for delivering on the American Dream and building the middle class, yet in 2024 only 10% of American workers were members of a labor union, down from 20% in 1983. The American Dream has also been said to be tied to American exceptionalism, and does not acknowledge the hardships many Americans have faced in regards to American slavery, Native American genocide, their legacies, and other examples of discriminatory violence.

== History ==

The meaning of the American Dream has changed over the course of history, and includes both personal components such as home ownership and upward mobility as well as a global vision for cultural hegemony and diplomacy.

===18th century===

Historically, the Dream originated in colonial mystique regarding frontier life. As John Murray, 4th Earl of Dunmore, the colonial Governor of Virginia, noted in 1774, the Americans &quot;for ever imagine the Lands further off are still better than those upon which they are already settled&quot;. He added that, &quot;if they attained Paradise, they would move on if they heard of a better place farther west&quot;. The idea of the American Dream is ever evolving and changing. When the Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776, the founding fathers believed that this would ratify the role of government and society in the United States. Jim Cullen claims:

Ever since, the Declaration of Independence has functioned as the banner of the American Dream, one repeatedly waved by figures that included women’s rights activists, populists, homosexuals, and anyone who has ever believed that happiness can not only be pursued, but attained. The U.S. Constitution, which marked the other bookend of the nation’s creation, lacks the mythic resonances of the Declaration, though it takes little reflection to see that it is the backdrop, if not the foundation, for all American Dreams. Whatever their disagreements about its scope or character, most Americans would agree that their national government is legitimate insofar as it permits a level playing field of dreams. Many of us have doubts that the government &quot;does&quot; serve this function; few have doubts that it &quot;should&quot;. 

=== 19th century ===
Many well-educated Germans who fled the failed 1848 revolution found the United States more politically free than their homeland, which they believed to be a hierarchical and aristocratic society that determined the ceiling for their aspirations. One of them said:

The German emigrant comes into a country free from the despotism, privileged orders and monopolies, intolerable taxes, and constraints in matters of belief and conscience. Everyone can travel and settle wherever he pleases. No passport is demanded, no police mingles in his affairs or hinders his movements ... Fidelity and merit are the only sources of honor here. The rich stand on the same footing as the poor; the scholar is not a mug above the most humble mechanics; no German ought to be ashamed to pursue any occupation ... [In America] wealth and possession of real estate confer not the least political right on its owner above what the poorest citizen has. Nor are there nobility, privileged orders, or standing armies to weaken the physical and moral power of the people, nor are there swarms of public functionaries to devour in idleness credit for. Above all, there are no princes and corrupt courts representing the so-called divine &#x27;right of birth&#x27;. In such a country the &quot;talents, energy and perseverance&quot; of a person ... have far greater opportunity to display than in monarchies.

The discovery of gold in California in 1849 brought in a hundred thousand men looking for their fortune overnight—and a few did find it. Thus was born the California Dream of instant success. Historian H. W. Brands noted that in the years after the Gold Rush, the California Dream spread across the nation:

The old American Dream ... was the dream of the Puritans, of Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Poor Richard&quot;... of men and women content to accumulate their modest fortunes a little at a time, year by year by year. The new dream was the dream of instant wealth, won in a twinkling by audacity and good luck. [This] golden dream ... became a prominent part of the American psyche only after Sutter&#x27;s Mill.

The 18th century provided Americans with new sources of wealth and new means of travel. When looking at immigration in history, it is important to consider the different experiences due to gender as much as due to race. Often, tensions between economic and political agendas come into play. After 1776, the United States became a significant part of the global economy. This paragraph highlights the complex relationships between global integration and American history:

These complicated transnational networks themselves are not the only story. Along with global integration went attempts to assert national distinctiveness amid growing global competition. Americans conceived of and responded to these pressures by striving to create national economic independence because they wanted to maintain political and social independence. Thus there was tension between the economic imperatives of global integration, and national political debates and economic agendas - such as the enhancement of national security through a strong industrial and financial base.

Historian Frederick Jackson Turner in 1893 advanced the frontier thesis, under which American democracy and the American Dream were formed by the American frontier. He stressed the process—the moving frontier line—and the impact it had on pioneers going through the process. He also stressed results; especially that American democracy was the primary result, along with egalitarianism, a lack of interest in high culture, and violence. &quot;American democracy was born of no theorist&#x27;s dream; it was not carried in the Susan Constant to Virginia, nor in the Mayflower to Plymouth. It came out of the American forest, and it gained new strength each time it touched a new frontier,&quot; said Turner.

In Turner&#x27;s thesis, the American frontier established liberty by releasing Americans from European mindsets and eroding old, dysfunctional customs. The frontier had no need for standing armies, established churches, aristocrats or nobles, nor for landed gentry who controlled most of the land and charged heavy rents. Frontier land was free for the taking. Turner first announced his thesis in a paper entitled &quot;The Significance of the Frontier in American History&quot;, delivered to the American Historical Association in 1893 in Chicago. He won wide acclaim among historians and intellectuals. Turner elaborated on the theme in his advanced history lectures and in a series of essays published over the next 25 years, published along with his initial paper as &quot;The Frontier in American History.&quot; Turner&#x27;s emphasis on the importance of the frontier in shaping American character influenced the interpretation found in thousands of scholarly histories. By the time Turner died in 1932, 60% of the leading history departments in the U.S. were teaching courses in frontier history along Turnerian lines.

=== 20th century ===
From out of the darkest years of the Great Depression, freelance writer James Truslow Adams popularized the phrase &quot;American Dream&quot; in his 1931 book &quot;Epic of America&quot;:

Adams contended that extreme wealth inequality was among the worst enemies of the American Dream, and said that:

He also said that the American institution that best exemplified the American dream was the Library of Congress; he contrasted it with European libraries of the time, which restricted access to many of their works, and argued that the Library, as an institution funded by and meant to uphold democracy, was an example of democratic government&#x27;s ability to uplift and equalize the people that it ruled over and was ruled by in order to &quot;save itself&quot; from a takeover by oligarchic forces. The Library also offered an opportunity for the whole nation to come together in thoughtful pursuit of a common good, which Adams claimed needed to be &quot;carried out in all departments of our national life&quot; in order to make the American Dream a reality.

Martin Luther King Jr., in his &quot;Letter from a Birmingham Jail&quot; (1963), rooted the civil rights movement in the African-American quest for the American Dream:

We will win our freedom because the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of God are embodied in our echoing demands ... when these disinherited children of God sat down at lunch counters they were in reality standing up for what is best in the American dream and for the most sacred values in our Judeo-Christian heritage, thereby bringing our nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the Founding Fathers in their formulation of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.

== Literature ==
The concept of the American Dream has been used in popular discourse, and scholars have traced its use in American literature ranging from the &quot;Autobiography&quot; of Benjamin Franklin, to Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; (1884), Willa Cather&#x27;s &quot;My Ántonia&quot;, F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1925), Theodore Dreiser&#x27;s &quot;An American Tragedy&quot; (1925) and Toni Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; (1977). Other writers who used the American Dream theme include Hunter S. Thompson, Edward Albee, John Steinbeck, Langston Hughes, and Giannina Braschi.

In 2006, Dr. Guiyou Huang from St. Thomas University in Florida wrote a
paper regarding the American Dream as a recurring theme in the fiction of Asian Americans.

=== American ideals ===
Many American authors added American ideals to their work as a theme or other reoccurring idea, to get their point across. There are many ideals that appear in American literature such as that all people are equal, the United States is the land of opportunity, independence is valued, the American Dream is attainable, and everyone can succeed with hard work and determination. John Winthrop also wrote about this term called American exceptionalism. This ideology refers to the idea that Americans are, as a nation, elect.

=== Literary commentary ===

The American Dream has been credited with helping to build a cohesive American experience, but has also been blamed for inflated expectations. Some commentators have noted that despite deep-seated belief in the egalitarian American Dream, the modern American wealth structure still perpetuates racial and class inequalities between generations. One sociologist notes that advantage and disadvantage are not always connected to individual successes or failures, but often to prior position in a social group.

Since the 1920s, numerous authors, such as Sinclair Lewis in his 1922 novel &quot;Babbitt&quot;, and F. Scott Fitzgerald, in his 1925 classic, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, satirized or ridiculed materialism in the chase for the American dream. For example, Jay Gatsby&#x27;s death mirrors the American Dream&#x27;s demise, reflecting the pessimism of modern-day Americans. The American Dream is a main theme in the book by John Steinbeck, &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;. The two friends George and Lennie dream of their own piece of land with a ranch, so they can &quot;live off the fatta the lan&#x27;&quot; and just enjoy a better life. The book later shows that not everyone can achieve the American Dream, although it is possible to achieve for a few. A lot of people follow the American Dream to achieve a greater chance of becoming rich. Some posit that the ease of achieving the American Dream changes with technological advances, availability of infrastructure and information, government regulations, state of the economy, and with the evolving cultural values of American demographics.

In 1949, Arthur Miller wrote &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, in which the American Dream is a fruitless pursuit. Similarly, in 1971 Hunter S. Thompson depicted in &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey Into the Heart of the American Dream&quot; a dark psychedelic reflection of the concept—successfully illustrated only in wasted pop-culture excess.

The novel &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; by Hubert Selby Jr. is an exploration of the pursuit of American success as it turns delirious and lethal, told through the ensuing tailspin of its main characters. George Carlin famously wrote the joke &quot;it&#x27;s called the American dream because you have to be asleep to believe it&quot;. Carlin pointed to &quot;the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions&quot; as having a greater influence than an individual&#x27;s choice. Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist and leftist activist Chris Hedges echoes this sentiment in his 2012 book &quot;Days of Destruction, Days of Revolt&quot;:

The vaunted American dream, the idea that life will get better, that progress is inevitable if we obey the rules and work hard, that material prosperity is assured, has been replaced by a hard and bitter truth. The American dream, we now know, is a lie. We will all be sacrificed. The virus of corporate abuse—the perverted belief that only corporate profit matters—has spread to outsource our jobs, cut the budgets of our schools, close our libraries, and plague our communities with foreclosures and unemployment.

The American Dream, and the sometimes dark response to it, has been a long-standing theme in American film. Many counterculture films of the 1960s and 1970s ridiculed the traditional quest for the American Dream. For example, &quot;Easy Rider&quot; (1969), directed by Dennis Hopper, shows the characters making a pilgrimage in search of &quot;the true America&quot; in terms of the hippie movement, drug use, and communal lifestyles.

== Political leaders ==
Scholars have explored the American Dream theme in the careers of numerous political leaders, including Henry Kissinger, Hillary Clinton, Benjamin Franklin, and Abraham Lincoln. The theme has been used for many local leaders as well, such as José Antonio Navarro, the Tejano leader (1795–1871), who served in the legislatures of Coahuila y Texas, the Republic of Texas, and the State of Texas.

In 2006, then U.S. Senator Barack Obama wrote a memoir, &quot;The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream&quot;. It was this interpretation of the American Dream for a young black man that helped establish his statewide and national reputations. The exact meaning of the Dream became a minor partisan political issue in the 2008 and 2012 elections.

Political conflicts, to some degree, have been ameliorated by the shared values of all parties in the expectation that the American Dream will resolve many difficulties and conflicts.

== Public opinion ==
The ethos today implies an opportunity for Americans to achieve prosperity through hard work. According to the Dream, this includes the opportunity for one&#x27;s children to grow up and receive a good education and career without artificial barriers. It is the opportunity to make individual choices without the prior restrictions that limited people according to their class, caste, religion, race, or ethnicity. Immigrants to the United States sponsored ethnic newspapers in their own language; the editors typically promoted the American Dream. Lawrence Samuel argues:

For many in both the working class and the middle class, upward mobility has served as the heart and soul of the American Dream, the prospect of &quot;betterment&quot; and to &quot;improve one&#x27;s lot&quot; for oneself and one&#x27;s children much of what this country is all about. &quot;Work hard, save a little, send the kids to college so they can do better than you did, and retire happily to a warmer climate&quot; has been the script we have all been handed.

A key element of the American Dream is promoting opportunity for one&#x27;s children, Johnson interviewing parents says, &quot;This was one of the most salient features of the interview data: parents—regardless of background—relied heavily on the American Dream to understand the possibilities for children, especially their own children&quot;. Rank et al. argue, &quot;The hopes and optimism that Americans possess pertain not only to their own lives, but to their children&#x27;s lives as well. A fundamental aspect of the American Dream has always been the expectation that the next generation should do better than the previous generation.&quot;

Hanson and Zogby (2010) report on numerous public opinion polls that since the 1980s have explored the meaning of the concept for Americans, and their expectations for its future. In these polls, a majority of Americans consistently reported that for their family, the American Dream is more about spiritual happiness than material goods. Majorities state that working hard is the most important element for getting ahead. However, an increasing minority stated that hard work and determination does not guarantee success.

In 2010, most Americans predicted that achieving the Dream with fair means would become increasingly difficult for future generations. They were increasingly pessimistic about the opportunity for the working class to get ahead; on the other hand, they were increasingly optimistic about the opportunities available to poor people and to new immigrants. Furthermore, most supported programs to make special efforts to help minorities get ahead.

In a 2013 poll by YouGov, 41% of responders said it is impossible for most to achieve the American Dream, while 38% said it is still possible. Most Americans perceive a college education as the ticket to the American Dream. Some recent observers warn that soaring student loan debt crisis and shortages of good jobs may undermine this ticket. The point was illustrated in &quot;The Fallen American Dream&quot;, a documentary film that details the concept of the American Dream from its historical origins to its current perception. A 2020 poll found 54% of American adults thought the American Dream was attainable for them, 28% believed it was not, and 9% rejected the idea of the American Dream entirely. Younger generations were less likely to believe this than their older counterparts, and black and Asian Americans less likely than whites, Hispanics and Native Americans.

Research published in 2013 shows that the U.S. provides, alongside the United Kingdom and Spain, the least economic mobility of any of 13 rich democratic countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Prior research suggested that the United States shows roughly average levels of occupational upward mobility and shows lower rates of income mobility than comparable societies.
Jo Blanden et al. report, &quot;the idea of the U.S. as &#x27;the land of opportunity&#x27; persists; and clearly seems misplaced.&quot; According to these studies, &quot;by international standards, the United States has an unusually low level of intergenerational mobility: our parents&#x27; income is highly predictive of our incomes as adults. Intergenerational mobility in the United States is lower than in France, Germany, Sweden, Canada, Finland, Norway and Denmark. Research in 2006 found that among high-income countries for which comparable estimates are available, only the United Kingdom had a lower rate of mobility than the United States.&quot; Economist Isabel Sawhill concluded that &quot;this challenges the notion of America as the land of opportunity&quot;.

Several public figures and commentators, from David Frum to Richard G. Wilkinson, have said that the American Dream is better realized in Denmark, which is ranked as having the highest social mobility in the OECD. In the U.S., 50% of a father&#x27;s income position is inherited by his son. In contrast, the amount in Norway or Canada is less than 20%. Moreover, in the U.S. 8% of children raised in the bottom 20% of the climbed to the top 20% as adult, while the figure in Denmark is nearly double at 15%. In 2015, economist Joseph Stiglitz stated, &quot;Maybe we should be calling the American Dream the Scandinavian Dream.&quot;

A 2023 paper written by academics at Bocconi University, the Rockwool Foundation, and Stockholm University found that &quot;Intergenerational poverty in the U.S. is four times stronger than in Denmark and Germany, and twice as strong as in Australia and the UK,&quot; and that an American child who grows up in poverty has &quot;a 43 percentage point higher mean poverty exposure during early adulthood (relative to an adult with no child poverty exposure),&quot; the highest of the five countries and exceeding the next highest by over 20 percentage points. The researchers found that &quot;the persistence of poverty is strongly connected to tax rates and what they call transfer insurance effects, which can be considered as akin to a social safety net,&quot; and that the &quot;U.S. is the archetype of a liberal and residualist welfare state, featuring stratified access to higher education and employment, strong earnings returns to higher education, and a comparatively weak welfare state to insure against risks in adulthood,&quot; as well as that &quot;exposure to childhood poverty is particularly severe in the US.&quot;

A 2017 study stated that the UK, Canada, and Denmark all offered a greater chance of social mobility. Black families were stated to be disadvantaged relative to white families when it comes to both upward mobility from the bottom and downward mobility from the top according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, with social mobility nationwide appearing to have declined since 1980. Social mobility can also vary widely geographically according to a 2014 paper, with the Southeast and lower East North Central states ranking near the bottom.

In the United States, home ownership is sometimes used as a proxy for achieving the promised prosperity; home ownership has been a status symbol separating the middle classes from the poor.

Sometimes the American Dream is identified with success in sports or how working class immigrants seek to join the American way of life.

According to a 2020 &quot;American Journal of Political Science&quot; study, Americans become less likely to believe in the attainability of the American dream as income inequality increases. A 2022 study in the same journal found that exposure to &quot;rags-to-riches&quot; narratives in entertainment make Americans more likely to believe in upward mobility.

According to a 2023 private opinion survey of American people by a Boston-based organization, Populace, the American Dream has shifted its narrative from fame and wealth to personal factors such as secure retirement, financial independence, parenthood and finding fulfillment in their work.

== Four American Dreams ==
Ownby (1999) identifies four American Dreams that the new consumer culture of the early 20th century addressed:

* The &quot;Dream of Abundance&quot;, offering a cornucopia of material goods to all Americans, making them proud to be the richest society on earth.
* The &quot;Dream of a Democracy of Goods&quot;, whereby everyone had access to the same products regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, or class, thereby challenging the aristocratic norms of the rest of the world where only the rich or well-connected were granted access to luxury.
* The &quot;Dream of Freedom of Choice&quot;, with its ever-expanding variety of good allowed people to fashion their own particular lifestyle.
* The &quot;Dream of Novelty&quot;, in which ever-changing fashions, new models, and unexpected new products broadened the consumer experience in terms of purchasing skills and awareness of the market, and challenged the conservatism of traditional society, culture, and politics.

Ownby acknowledges that the American Dreams of the new consumer culture radiated out from the major cities, but notes that they quickly penetrated the most rural and most isolated areas, such as rural Mississippi. With the arrival of affordable automobiles such as the Ford Model T in the 1910s, consumers in rural America were no longer forced to only buy from local general stores with their limited merchandise and high prices, and could instead visit cheaper, better-stocked shops in towns and cities. Ownby demonstrates that poor black Mississippians shared in the new consumer culture, and it motivated the more ambitious to move to Memphis or Chicago.

== Other parts of the world ==
The aspirations of the &quot;American Dream&quot; in the broad sense of upward mobility have been systematically spread to other nations since the 1890s as American missionaries and businessmen consciously sought to spread the Dream, says Rosenberg. Looking at American business, religious missionaries, philanthropies, Hollywood, labor unions and U.S. government agencies, she says they saw their mission not in catering to foreign elites but instead reaching the world&#x27;s masses in a democratic fashion: &quot;They linked mass production, mass marketing, and technological improvement to an enlightened democratic spirit ... In the emerging litany of the American dream what historian Daniel J. Boorstin later termed a &#x27;democracy of things&#x27; would disprove both Malthus&#x27;s predictions of scarcity and Marx&#x27;s of class conflict.&quot; It was, she says &quot;a vision of global social progress&quot;. Rosenberg calls the overseas version of the American Dream &quot;liberal-developmentalism&quot; and identified five critical components: (1) belief that other nations could and should replicate America&#x27;s own developmental experience; (2) faith in private free enterprise; (3) support for free or open access for trade and investment; (4) promotion of free flow of information and culture; and (5) growing acceptance of [U.S.] governmental activity to protect private enterprise and to stimulate and regulate American participation in international economic and cultural exchange.

Knights and McCabe argued American management gurus have taken the lead in exporting the ideas: &quot;By the latter half of the twentieth century they were truly global and through them the American Dream continues to be transmitted, repackaged and sold by an infantry of consultants and academics backed up by an artillery of books and videos&quot;.

=== Germany and Italy ===
In West Germany after World War II, says Reiner Pommerin, &quot;the most intense motive was the longing for a better life, more or less identical with the American dream, which also became a German dream&quot;. Cassamagnaghi argues that to women in Italy after 1945, films and magazine stories about American life offered an American Dream. New York City especially represented a sort of utopia where every sort of dream and desire could become true. Italian women saw a model for their own emancipation from second class status in their patriarchal society.

=== Britain ===
The American dream regarding home ownership had little resonance before the 1980s. In the 1980s, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher worked to create a similar dream, by selling public-housing units to their tenants. Her Conservative Party called for more home ownership: &quot;HOMES OF OUR OWN: To most people ownership means first and foremost a home of their own ... We should like in time to improve on existing legislation with a realistic grants scheme to assist first-time buyers of cheaper homes.&quot; Guest calls this Thatcher&#x27;s approach to the American Dream. Knights and McCabe argue that &quot;a reflection and reinforcement of the American Dream has been the emphasis on individualism as extolled by Margaret Thatcher and epitomized by the &#x27;enterprise&#x27; culture.&quot;

=== Russia ===
Since the fall of communism in the Soviet Union in 1991, the American Dream has fascinated Russians. The first post-Communist leader Boris Yeltsin embraced the &quot;American way&quot; and teamed up with Harvard University free market economists Jeffrey Sachs and Robert Allison to give Russia economic shock therapy in the 1990s. The newly independent Russian media idealized America and endorsed shock therapy for the economy. In 2008 Russian President Dmitry Medvedev lamented the fact that 77% of Russia&#x27;s 142 million people live &quot;cooped up&quot; in apartment buildings. In 2010 his administration announced a plan for widespread home ownership: &quot;Call it the Russian Dream&quot;, said Alexander Braverman, the Director of the Federal Fund for the Promotion of Housing Construction Development. In 2010, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, worried about his nation&#x27;s very low birth rate, said he hoped home ownership would inspire Russians &quot;to have more babies&quot;.

=== China ===
The Chinese Dream describes a set of ideals in the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is used by journalists, government officials and activists to describe the aspiration of individual self-improvement in Chinese society. Although the phrase has been used previously by Western journalists and scholars, a translation of a &quot;New York Times&quot; article written by the American journalist Thomas Friedman, &quot;China Needs Its Own Dream&quot;, has been credited with popularizing the concept in China. He attributes the term to Peggy Liu and the environmental NGO JUCCCE&#x27;s China Dream project, which defines the Chinese Dream as sustainable development. In 2013, China&#x27;s new paramount leader Xi Jinping began promoting the phrase as a slogan, leading to its widespread use in the Chinese media.

The concept of the Chinese Dream is very similar to the idea of the American Dream. It stresses entrepreneurship and glorifies a generation of self-made men and women in post-reform China, such as rural immigrants who moved to the urban centers and improved their living standards and social life. The Chinese Dream can be interpreted as the collective consciousness of Chinese people during the era of social transformation and economic progress. The idea was put forward by Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping on November 29, 2012. The government hoped to revitalize China, while promoting innovation and technology to boost the international prestige of China. In this light, the Chinese Dream, like the American Dream, is a nationalistic concept as well, providing a vision of a sort of Chinese exceptionalism.

According to Ellen Brown, writing in 2019, over 90% of Chinese families own their own homes, giving the country one of the highest rates of home ownership in the world.

<text>Lilburn Williams Boggs (December 14, 1796March 14, 1860) was the sixth Governor of Missouri, from 1836 to 1840. He is now most widely remembered for his interactions with Joseph Smith and Porter Rockwell, and Missouri Executive Order 44, known by Mormons as the &quot;Extermination Order&quot;, issued in response to the ongoing conflict between church members and other settlers of Missouri. Boggs was also a key player in the Honey War of 1837.

==Early life==
Boggs was born in Lexington, Fayette County, Kentucky, on December 14, 1796, to John McKinley Boggs and Martha Oliver. Boggs served for 18 months with the Kentucky troops during the War of 1812. He moved in 1816 from Lexington, Kentucky, to Missouri, which was then part of the Louisiana Territory. He was a member of the Smithton Company that would establish the Town of Smithton that would later grow into Columbia, Missouri.

In Greenup County, Kentucky, in 1817, Boggs married his first wife, Julia Ann Bent (1801–1820), a sister of the Bent brothers of Bent&#x27;s Fort fame, and daughter of Silas Bent, then a judge in the Missouri Supreme Court. She died on September 21, 1820, in St Louis, Missouri. They had two children, Angus and Henry.

In 1823, Boggs married Panthea Grant Boone (1801–1880), a granddaughter of Daniel Boone, in Callaway County, Missouri. They spent most of the following twenty-three years in Jackson County, Missouri, where all but two of their many children were born.

Boggs started out as a clerk, then entered politics. He served as a Missouri state senator from 1825 to 1832; as lieutenant governor from 1832 to 1836; governor from 1836 to 1840; and again as state senator from 1842 to 1846. He was a Democrat.

==Extermination order==

While governor of Missouri, Boggs issued Missouri Executive Order 44, a document known in Latter Day Saint history as the &quot;Extermination Order&quot;. A response to the escalating threats and violence in what came to be known as the Missouri 1838 Mormon War, this executive order was issued on October 27, 1838, and called for Latter Day Saints to be driven from the state, because of what he termed their

...open and avowed defiance of the laws, and of having made war upon the people of this State ... the Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State if necessary for the public peace—their outrages are beyond all description.

The order was rescinded on June 25, 1976, after nearly 138 years, by Missouri Governor Kit Bond, who declared that the original order violated legal rights established by the U.S. Constitution. In rescinding the order, Bond offered his regrets on behalf of the state.

==Assassination attempt==


Boggs, who was from Independence, moved to a house within the City of Zion plot in Independence after the Mormons were evicted from Missouri and after he left office. His home was three blocks east of Temple Lot. On the rainy evening of May 6, 1842, Boggs was shot by an unknown party who fired at him through a window as he read a newspaper in his study. Boggs was hit by large buckshot in four places: two balls were lodged in his skull, another lodged in his neck, and a fourth entered his throat, whereupon Boggs swallowed it. Boggs was severely injured. Several doctors—including his brother—pronounced Boggs as good as dead; at least one newspaper ran an obituary. To everyone&#x27;s great surprise, Boggs not only survived, but gradually improved.

The crime was investigated by Sheriff J.H. Reynolds, who discovered a revolver at the scene, still loaded with buckshot. He surmised that the suspect had fired upon Boggs and lost his firearm in the dark rainy night when the weapon recoiled due to its unusually large shot. The gun had been stolen from a local shopkeeper, who identified &quot;that hired man of Ward&#x27;s&quot; as the &quot;most likely culprit&quot;. Reynolds, then acting on the testimony of the storekeeper, determined that the man in question was Orrin Porter Rockwell, a close associate of Smith. Reynolds eventually caught Rockwell and held him for almost a year while he awaited trial. Reynolds could not produce any evidence that Rockwell was involved in any way and he was acquitted of all charges concerning Boggs, after prominent lawyer Alexander Doniphan agreed to defend him.

A few people saw the assassination attempt positively: an anonymous contributor to &quot;The Wasp&quot;, a pro-Mormon newspaper in Nauvoo, Illinois, that was run by Joseph Smith&#x27;s brother, William Smith, wrote on May 28 that &quot;Boggs is undoubtedly killed according to report; but who did the noble deed remains to be found out&quot;.

Rockwell denied involvement in oblique terms, stating that he had &quot;done nothing criminal&quot;. Also at about this time, John C. Bennett reported that Smith had offered a cash reward to anyone who would assassinate Boggs, and that Smith had admitted to him that Rockwell had done the deed. He went on to say that Rockwell had made a veiled threat against Bennett&#x27;s life if he publicized the story. Joseph Smith vehemently denied Bennett&#x27;s account, speculating that Boggs — no longer governor, but campaigning for state senate — was attacked by an election opponent. Mormon writer Monte B. McLaws, in the &quot;Missouri Historical Review&quot;, supported Smith, averring that while there was no clear finger pointing to anyone, Governor Boggs was running for election against several violent men, all capable of the deed, and that there was no particular reason to suspect Rockwell of the crime. The following year Rockwell was arrested, tried, and acquitted of the attempted murder.

==California==

Boggs traveled overland to California in 1846 and is frequently mentioned among the notable emigrants of that year. His traveling companions widely believed that his move was rooted in his fear of the Mormons. When the train set out in early May, he campaigned to be elected its captain, but lost to William H. Russell; when Russell resigned on June 18, the group was thereafter led by Boggs. Among the Boggs Company were most of the emigrants who later separated from the group to form the Donner Party.

Boggs was accompanied by his second wife, Panthea, and his younger children as well as his son, William, and William&#x27;s bride, Sonora Hicklin. They arrived in Sonoma, California, in November and were provided refuge by Mariano Vallejo at his Petaluma ranch house. There, on January 4, 1847, Mrs. William Boggs gave birth to a son, who was named Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo Boggs after their benefactor. Lilburn Boggs became alcalde of the Sonoma district in 1847. During the California Gold Rush, Boggs owned a store and did quite well. On November 8, 1849, Boggs resigned as alcalde and became the town&#x27;s postmaster.

Boggs was elected to the California State Assembly from the Sonoma District in 1852.

In 1855, he retired to live at Rancho Napa in Napa County, California, where he died on March 14, 1860. His widow Panthea died in Napa County, California, on September 23, 1880. They are buried in Tulocay Cemetery, Napa, California.

His son, Theodore Boggs, would later found the town of Big Bug, Arizona, where he fought Apaches during a small encounter at the Big Bug mine.

<doc id="373940" wikidata="Q17101133" url="?curid=373940" title="Baltimore Claws">
<text>The Baltimore Claws were an American basketball team which was supposed to appear in the 1975–76 season in the American Basketball Association. However, the team folded operations before the ABA&#x27;s final season started, playing only three exhibition games, all losses, in its brief history.

==Background==
The team that eventually became the Baltimore Claws had earlier competed in the ABA as the New Orleans Buccaneers from 1967 through 1970, as the Memphis Pros from 1970 through 1972, as the Memphis Tams from 1972 through 1974 and as the Memphis Sounds during the 1974–75 season. The Memphis franchise had struggled through the years and in its last season there it had relied on the league itself to handle some of its bills. The Sounds began the 1974–75 season with a win followed by several losses; fan interest waned but the team rallied to finish in fourth place in the ABA&#x27;s Eastern Division. In the playoffs they lost in the Eastern Division semifinals to the eventual league champion Kentucky Colonels, 4 games to 1. Of the Sounds&#x27; draft picks that season, two of them (Lonnie Shelton and Terry Furlow) remained in college, while the third (Rich Kelley) signed with the NBA&#x27;s New Orleans Jazz instead. At the close of the 1974–75 season, league commissioner Tedd Munchak issued an ultimatum to the Sounds if they wanted to stay in Memphis: sell 4,000 season tickets, line up new investors for the team, and get a better lease at the Mid-South Coliseum. When none of the conditions were met, the league effectively took control of the franchise and put it on the open market.

==Relocation to Maryland==
Prior to the 1975–76 season, a consortium of seven Maryland businessmen led by David Cohan bought the troubled Sounds for $1 million and relocated it to Baltimore. In August 1975, new ABA Commissioner Dave DeBusschere suddenly awarded the franchise to another group in Memphis due to apparent financial problems involving the Baltimore owners. However, the Memphis group in question backed out on buying the Sounds franchise the very next day, and the franchise reverted to Baltimore once again after the Cohan-led group made a $250,000 down payment.

The team was initially named the Baltimore Hustlers, but both league and public pressure forced them to rename it to the Claws instead.

==Personnel==
In September the Claws gained attention early by gaining the rights to superstar Dan Issel of the reigning ABA champion Kentucky Colonels. The Colonels were supposed to receive center Tom Owens and $500,000 in cash for Issel, but the $500,000 never arrived. When Colonels owner John Y. Brown, Jr. found out the money hadn&#x27;t arrived, he stormed into a Claws&#x27; board meeting and announced to them that Issel was being sold to the Denver Nuggets instead. To make the move look like a official trade between Denver and Baltimore instead, the Nuggets sent forward Dave Robisch to the Claws. The Claws&#x27; owners protested, claiming that three more players should have come to Baltimore in the trade. They threatened to fold the team if the other players didn&#x27;t arrive, but the league ruled against them. The Claws then sent another good player, Rick Mount, to the Utah Stars in another trade they did.

The Claws entered the preseason under head coach Joe Mullaney with a roster that included Mel Daniels and Stew Johnson as key players. The Claws also suited up guard Skip Wise, who in the previous year was the first freshman to make the Atlantic Coast Conference All-Conference First Team after the NCAA changed its rules to allow for freshmen players to play college basketball. But Wise (a native of Baltimore) chose not to return to Clemson for his sophomore year, instead signing a five-year, $700,000 no-cut contract with the Claws.

==Games==
The Baltimore Claws played only three games in their history, all preseason exhibitions. The first was on October 9, 1975, in the nearby city of Salisbury, Maryland, against the Virginia Squires. The Squires won their first match against the Claws 131–121; attendance was reported to be at 1,150 people.

Two days later the Claws lost to the NBA&#x27;s Philadelphia 76ers 103–82 in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, in front of a capacity crowd of 1,213 at the East High School there.

On October 16, 1975, the Claws played the Squires again, this time at the Knott Arena in Mount St. Mary&#x27;s College at Emmitsburg, Maryland. Virginia won once again, this time by a 100–88 final score, in front of approximately 500 spectators.

==Continuing problems==
Due to mounting financial problems, the second loss to the Squires ended up being the Claws&#x27; final game. Players and coaches were going unpaid and not even getting their per diem meal money. Only 300 season tickets had been sold, below even the number of fans in their last preseason game. The players were still wearing old red Sounds uniforms with a green patch placed on it saying &quot;Claws&quot; over the old &quot;Sounds&quot; name, along with unaltered red Sounds warmups. Their practice T-shirts also had rips under the arms.

On October 16, 1975, ABA Commissioner DeBusschere got word that one of the Claws&#x27; banks had yanked its line of credit. DeBusschere responded with an ultimatum to the owners of the Claws: deposit $500,000 with the league as a &quot;performance bond&quot; within four days to cover expenses or be shut down entirely. The Claws got together half of the money necessary, but could not raise the rest to survive. Reportedly, the remaining money, plus an additional $70,000, was being held in escrow by the city, to be released only if Cohan resigned from his position.

The ABA disbanded the Claws on October 20, 1975, less than a week before the regular season began. The league issued a statement noting that it had been prepared to enter the 1975–76 season with &quot;nine solid teams.&quot; League officials added that the Claws&#x27; backers had been unable to get their affairs in order despite being given extra time to do so. The Claws&#x27; office at the Baltimore Civic Center was padlocked by arena management due to unpaid bills. (Incredibly, the Claws were just one of &quot;four&quot; different Baltimore &quot;major league&quot; franchises that vanished in 1975, the others being the Baltimore Banners of World Team Tennis, who folded in February; the Baltimore Blades of the World Hockey Association, who folded after their 1974–75 season concluded during their brief stay there; and finally the North American Soccer League&#x27;s Baltimore Comets, who shifted to San Diego just a few days before the Claws officially folded.)

The Claws threatened to seek an injunction delaying the start of the season until Baltimore were reinstated, citing a provision in the rules requiring a ten days notice before any team could be shuttered. However, after both the ABA and the city threatened to file their own legal actions, the Claws quietly folded operations entirely; the league felt the ten-day rule was trumped by a larger obligation to ensure that its franchises were being run in a professional manner (and later, for the league&#x27;s survival in its final season of existence).

==Dissolution==
The Claws players were put into a dispersal draft. Both Dave Robisch and Paul Ruffner ended up going to the Spirits of St. Louis. Stew Johnson was sent to the San Diego Sails (who also folded just a few weeks later, with the San Antonio Spurs acquiring Johnson in a different dispersal draft). Claude Terry was sent to the Denver Nuggets. Chuck Williams was sent to the Virginia Squires. Scott English was sent to the Indiana Pacers. Joe Hamilton was sent to the Utah Stars. George Carter also ended up with the Stars despite not being picked in the dispersal draft; Utah would become the ABA&#x27;s third casualty of the season, suspending operations in early December. Only the Kentucky Colonels, New York Nets, and San Antonio Spurs declined to enter the dispersal draft for the defunct Claws franchise. The Claws&#x27; best known player, Mel Daniels, was disappointed at the Claws&#x27; fate and retired from play altogether rather than play for another team elsewhere. In Terry Pluto&#x27;s book on the ABA, &quot;Loose Balls&quot;, Daniels recalled that the Claws&#x27; players were allowed to take equipment and furniture from the team&#x27;s office in lieu of payment.

==Aftermath==
The league&#x27;s assertion that they had &quot;nine solid teams&quot; quickly proved to be incorrect, as both the San Diego Sails and the Utah Stars ceased operations early in the season. The wobbly Virginia Squires franchise did manage to finish the 1975-76 regular season campaign, but with an awful 15–68 record played in front of small crowds; they too folded before the end of the 1976 ABA Playoffs, leaving the ABA with only six standing teams left on their end. Finally, the ABA would merge with the NBA during the summer of 1976.

<doc id="373941" wikidata="Q8037068" url="?curid=373941" title="Worshipful Company of Musicians">
<text>The Worshipful Company of Musicians is one of the Livery Companies of the City of London. Its history dates back to at least 1350. Originally a specialist guild for musicians, its role became an anachronism in the 18th century, when the centre of music making in London moved from the city to the West End, and for more than a century it was a general guild for figures in the city, with no specific musical role. In the late 19th century, the musical element was revived, and the modern Company promotes all aspects of the art and science of music.

==History==
The guild is believed to have been in existence at least as early as 1350, but the earliest official charter known was granted by King Edward IV to his minstrels in 1469. In 1500, the Fellowship of Minstrels was granted incorporation as the Musicians&#x27; Company by the Lord Mayor of the City of London, and the company was given the right to regulate all musicians within the city. In earlier centuries, minstrels had held an honourable position in mediaeval society, but by the 15th century they were less highly regarded, and the protection of a guild was much needed. The guild received a Royal Charter in 1604, transforming it into the Worshipful Company of Musicians, with the influence and prestige of other City livery companies. It was granted control over all music-making in and within three miles of London, except for Westminster and Southwark. Nevertheless, the musicians employed by the court and powerful aristocratic families resisted the new Company&#x27;s authority, and in 1632 Charles I revoked the 1604 charter. In 1637 the Westminster Musicians Guild attempted to assert control of the city&#x27;s musicians, and the Company fought hard to retain its privileges, operating without a charter from 1632 to 1950.

By the middle of the 18th century most public music-making had moved from the city to the newly built West End of London, and the Worshipful Company had become an anachronism. To maintain its membership and existence, the company began admitting non-musicians, principally leading City businessmen, and, like many of the Livery Companies, it lost its original specialist identity. In 1870, with the election of the music publisher William Chappell, the company began to revive its interest in music. A modest number of musicians were admitted to membership, and the non-musicians in the Company agreed to an increasing emphasis on musical philanthropy as its primary activity.

Despite the lack of an official charter since 1632, the Company held tercentenary celebrations at the beginning of the twentieth century, under the direction of Colonel Thomas Bradney Shaw-Hellier commandant of the Royal Military School of Music. Masters of the Company who have been composers or otherwise connected with music include: Frederick Bridge, 1892; Herbert Sullivan, 1926; Hugh Allen, 1937; Herbert Howells, 1959; Jack Westrup, 1971; and Lennox Berkeley, 1976.

In 1949 the Company successfully petitioned the City authorities for permission to apply to King George VI for a new charter of incorporation. The new charter was granted in 1950.

==Present-day activities==
The Company no longer has the power to regulate music within the city. It supports musicians and musical education, awarding prizes, scholarships and medals, among which are the Collard Fellowship, the Cobbett Prize for chamber music, the Santley medal for singers, the New Elizabethan Award (NEA) for guitarists, lutenists, and singers, and more than thirty other annual awards in honour of, among others, Harriet Cohen, Harry Mortimer, John Christie, and Priaulx Rainier. Its Yeomen Programme is a young artists’ scheme for musicians who have won one of its awards.

The company now has more than 390 liverymen and its affairs are managed by a Master, Senior Warden and Junior Warden, elected annually, and the Court of Assistants. The Company ranks fiftieth in the order of precedence for Livery Companies. Its motto is &quot;Preserve Harmony&quot;.

===Awards===

<doc id="373942" wikidata="Q715524" url="?curid=373942" title="Joe Masseria">
<text>Giuseppe &quot;Joe the Boss&quot; Masseria (; January 17, 1886April 15, 1931) was an Italian-American Mafia boss in New York City. He was boss of what is now called the Genovese crime family, one of the New York City Mafia&#x27;s Five Families, from 1922 to 1931. In 1930, he battled in the Castellammarese War to take over the criminal activities in New York City. The war ended with his murder on April 15, 1931, in a hit ordered by his own lieutenant, Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano, in an agreement with rival faction head Salvatore Maranzano.

==Early life==
Giuseppe Masseria was born on January 17, 1886, in Menfi, Province of Agrigento, Sicily, in a family of tailors. When he was young, he moved to the town of Marsala, in the Province of Trapani. Masseria arrived in the United States in 1902. He then became part of the Morello crime family based in Harlem and parts of Little Italy in southern Manhattan. Masseria was a contemporary of other captains of that mafia family such as Gaetano Reina. In 1909, Masseria was convicted of burglary and received a suspended sentence. On May 23, 1913, Masseria was sentenced to four to six years in prison for third-degree burglary.

As the 1910s ended, Masseria and boss Salvatore D&#x27;Aquila vied for power in New York. By the early 1920s, they were at war with each other. In 1920, Masseria had recruited Lucky Luciano as one of his gunmen. D&#x27;Aquila also had a gunman working for him, Umberto Valenti, and ordered him to kill Masseria. On May 8, 1922, the boss of the Morello/Terranova crime family, Vincenzo Terranova, was killed in a drive-by shooting near his E. 116th Street home. Valenti was believed to have been personally responsible. Hours later, Terranova&#x27;s underboss Silva Tagliagamba was fatally wounded in Lower Manhattan by Valenti and gunmen working for him. That night, Valenti and some of his men attacked the new boss of the rival Terranova family, Masseria. Valenti found Masseria and his bodyguards on Grand Street &quot;within a block of Police Headquarters&quot;. Masseria got away, but the gunmen had shot four men and two women; Masseria tossed his pistol away and was arrested while fleeing the scene.

On August 9, 1922, Masseria walked out of his apartment at 80 2nd Avenue, and was rushed by two armed men who opened fire on him. Masseria ducked into a store at 82 2nd Avenue with the gunmen in pursuit. They shot out the front window and shot up the inside of the store. The gunmen fled across 2nd Avenue to a getaway car idling just around the corner on E. 5th Street. The gunmen jumped on the running boards as the car sped west on E. 5th Street towards the Bowery, guns blazing. The gunmen then plowed through a crowd and shot randomly at the blockade, wounding six men. Masseria survived the incident and was found by police in his upstairs bedroom shell-shocked. He was sitting on his bed dazed, with two bullet holes through his straw hat, which he was still wearing. The incident gained Masseria new respect among gangsters as &quot;the man who can dodge bullets&quot; and his reputation began to rise as D&#x27;Aquila&#x27;s began to wane. 

Forty-eight hours later, on August 11, Valenti attended a meeting in a cafe at the corner of Second Avenue and E. 12th Street, where he was murdered as he tried to flee.

==Castellammarese War==
Masseria became head of the Morello family and was known as &quot;Joe the Boss&quot;, with Giuseppe Morello as his &quot;consigliere&quot;.

Salvatore D&#x27;Aquila was killed on October 10, 1928. Masseria, the leader of a gang that emerged from the old Morello crime family, was selected to replace D&#x27;Aquila as the new &quot;capo dei capi&quot; that winter. After his elevation, Masseria began applying pressure to other mafia gangs for monetary tributes. Other mobsters accused him of orchestrating the 1930 murders of Gaspar Milazzo in Detroit and Gaetano Reina in the Bronx. Nicolo Schiro tried to replicate the strategy of neutrality he used to deal with D&#x27;Aquila with Masseria but he was vigorously opposed by Salvatore Maranzano and Buffalo boss Stefano Magaddino. Masseria claimed Schiro had committed a transgression and demanded Schiro pay him $10,000 and step down as leader of his mafia crime family. Schiro complied. Soon after, Vito Bonventre was murdered at his home on July 15, 1930. This led to Maranzano being elevated to boss of the gang and a conflict with Masseria and his allies referred to as the Castellammarese War.

During the Castellammarese War, between 1930 and 1931, Masseria and Morello fought against a rival group, based in Brooklyn, led by Salvatore Maranzano and Joseph Bonanno. Morello, an old hand in the killing game, became Masseria&#x27;s &quot;war chief&quot; and strategic adviser.

One of the first victims of the war, Morello was killed along with associate Joseph Perriano on August 15, 1930, while collecting cash receipts in his East Harlem office. Joseph Valachi, the first made man in the American Mafia to turn state&#x27;s evidence, identified Morello&#x27;s killer as a Castellammarese gunman he knew as &quot;Buster from Chicago&quot;.

==Death==
In a secret deal with Maranzano, Lucky Luciano agreed to engineer the death of his boss, Masseria, in return for receiving Masseria&#x27;s rackets and becoming Maranzano&#x27;s second-in-command. Joe Adonis had joined the Masseria faction and when Masseria heard about Luciano&#x27;s betrayal, he approached Adonis about killing Luciano. However, Adonis instead warned Luciano about the murder plot. On April 15, 1931, Luciano lured Masseria to a meeting where he was murdered at a restaurant called Nuova Villa Tammaro on Coney Island. While they played cards, Luciano allegedly excused himself to the bathroom, with the gunmen reportedly being Albert Anastasia, Vito Genovese, Joe Adonis, and Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel; Ciro &quot;The Artichoke King&quot; Terranova drove the getaway car, but legend has it that he was too shaken up to drive away and had to be shoved out of the driver&#x27;s seat by Siegel.

Luciano was brought in for questioning by the police. At the time, police suspected a gangster named John &quot;Silk Stockings&quot; Giustra as being one of the gunmen in Masseria&#x27;s murder. This was based on the report of a confidential informant and that one of the coats found at the murder scene was identified as belonging to Giustra. The case was dropped after Giustra was murdered on July 9, 1931.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;[A]fter that, the police have been unable to learn definitely [what happened]&quot;. Reputedly Masseria was &quot;seated at a table playing cards with two or three unknown men&quot; when he was fired upon from behind. He died from gunshot wounds to his head, back, and chest. Masseria&#x27;s autopsy report shows that he died on an empty stomach. No witnesses came forward, though &quot;two or three&quot; men were observed leaving the restaurant and getting into a stolen car. No one was convicted in Masseria&#x27;s murder as there were no witnesses and Luciano had an alibi.

Masseria is buried at Calvary Cemetery in Queens, New York.

<doc id="373944" wikidata="Q6269101" url="?curid=373944" title="Joint Base Anacostia–Bolling">
<text>Joint Base Anacostia–Bolling (JBAB) is a 905-acre (366 ha) military installation, located in Southwest Washington, D.C., established on 1 October 2010 in accordance with congressional legislation implementing the recommendations of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. The legislation ordered the consolidation of Naval Support Facility Anacostia and Bolling Air Force Base, which were adjoining but separate military installations into a single joint base, one of twelve formed in the country as a result of the law. The base hosts the Defense Intelligence Agency Headquarters amongst its other responsibilities. The only aeronautical facility at the base is a 100-by-100-foot (30 by 30 m) helipad (ICAO: KBOF).

==Overview==
Joint Base Anacostia–Bolling (JBAB) is responsible for providing installation support to 17,000 military, civilian employees and their families, 48 mission and tenant units, including ceremonial units (United States Air Force Honor Guard, USAF Band, USAF Chaplains, the Navy Ceremonial Guard), various Army, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, Joint Service commands and other DOD and federal agencies.

Bolling Air Force Base units also provide ceremonial support to the White House, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of the Air Force, and the Air Force Chief of Staff, mainly through 11th Wing, the United States Air Force Honor Guard and The United States Air Force Band.

NSF Anacostia falls under the command of Naval District Washington.

Additionally, the Defense Intelligence Agency Headquarters has been located at Joint Base Anacostia–Bolling since 1987, and Coast Guard Station Washington, D.C., is located on the post next to the Capitol Cove Marina. The Naval Research Laboratory is not part of the Joint Base but is located immediately adjacent to it. Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General is also located in the base.

The Naval Media Center was transferred to Fort Meade in 2011.

==History==
===Nacotchtank history===
Prior to European colonization, the area where the Joint Base Anacostia–Bolling is located was inhabited by the Nacotchtank, an Algonquian people. The largest village of the Nacotchtank was located just north of the base, south of Anacostia Park. Two ossuaries (burial grounds) have been discovered at Bolling Air Force Base and other Nacotchtank archaeological sites have been found at Giesboro Point on the Potomac River. The two burial mounds, which included Nacotchtank bones and skulls, were discovered in 1936 by crews working at the air force base. The burial site was also likely once a Nacotchtank village.

===Slavery===
The Giesborough site was owned by one of the largest slave holders in the area, George Washington Young. The site was purchased in 1833 and operated as a large plantation until the start of the civil war. Large tracts of land were donated to the Union so that a cavalry post could be established.

===Naval Support Facility Anacostia===

The Navy began testing seaplanes at this facility in 1918, and it eventually became a naval air station supporting conventional aircraft. Located immediately north of Bolling Air Force Base, NAS Anacostia remained in service as an active naval air station until 1962, when its runways were deactivated concurrent with Bolling&#x27;s due to traffic pattern issues with nearby Washington National Airport.

Redesignated as a naval support facility, NSF Anacostia serves as headquarters for Commander, Naval Installations, Navy Office of the Chief of Information, and continues to maintain a large heliport facility, primarily used by Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) in support of &quot;Marine One&quot; presidential transport operations with VH-3D and VH-60N aircraft.

===Bolling Air Force Base===


Bolling&#x27;s property has been a Department of Defense (DOD) asset since 1917. From its beginning, the installation has included the Army Air Corps (predecessor to today’s Air Force) and Navy aviation and support elements. The tract of land selected for the base was scouted by William C. Ocker at the direction of General Billy Mitchell. The base began near Anacostia in 1918, as the only military airfield near the United States Capitol and was originally named The Flying Field at Anacostia on 2 October 1917. It was renamed Anacostia Experimental Flying Field in June 1918.

Not long after its acquisition by the military, the single installation evolved into two separate, adjoining bases; one Army (later Air Force) and one Navy. Bolling Field was officially opened 1 July 1918 and was named in honor of the first high-ranking air service officer killed in World War I, Colonel Raynal C. Bolling. Colonel Bolling was the Assistant Chief of the Air Service, and was killed in action near Amiens, France, on 26 March 1918 while defending himself and his driver, Private Paul L. Holder, from an attack by German soldiers.

In the late 1940s, Bolling Field’s property became Naval Air Station Anacostia and a new Air Force base, named Bolling Air Force Base, was constructed just to the south on 24 June 1948.

Bolling AFB has served as a research and testing ground for new aviation equipment and its first mission provided aerial defense of the capital. It moved to its present location, along the Potomac in the city&#x27;s southwest quadrant, in the 1930s.

Over the years, Marine Corps, Coast Guard and National Guard units, as well as DOD and federal agencies also found the installation to be an ideal place from which to operate.

Throughout World War II, the installation served as a training and organizational base for personnel and units going overseas.

In 1962, fixed-wing aircraft operations at the air force and naval installations ceased, due to congested airspace around Washington National Airport on the opposite shore of the Potomac River. Although fixed-wing aircraft operations ceased, the installations continued to serve many capacities, including service with the Military Airlift Command (MAC); the headquarters for the Air Force District of Washington; the Air Force 11th Wing; Commander, Naval Installations Command, Naval Media Center (now, Defense Media Activity-Navy) and many other military commands and federal agencies

The Air Force District of Washington (AFDW) was created and activated at Bolling on 1 October 1985 with the mission of providing administrative support to Air Force members. On 15 July 1994, AFDW was inactivated, but was reactivated 5 January 2005 to &quot;provide a single voice for Air Force requirements in the National Capital Region&quot; according to the base&#x27;s website.

=== Joint base ===
By 2020, more than half of the activity at Anacostia–Bolling fell under the US Air Force. Consequently, it was decided that installation management and support at the base would transfer from the US Navy to the Air Force. To facilitate the change, on 11 June 2020 the 11th Wing inactivated as the host wing at Joint Base Andrews and reactivated as the 316th Wing. After fifteen years of being based at Andrews, the 11th Wing returned to Anacostia-Bolling on 12 June 2020 and activated as the host wing at the base. A memorandum of agreement was signed between the Navy and the Air Force on 24 June 2020 which formalized the transition, however the Air Force did not officially take control until 1 October 2020.

Residents are zoned to District of Columbia Public Schools. Residents are zoned to Leckie Elementary School, Hart Middle School, and Ballou High School. There is a charter school on JBAB, LEARN D.C.

There was previously a proposal for an on-base school dating to the 1960s. In 2010 Leckie had about 33% of its students from military families. Leckie Elementary is near Anacostia-Bolling&#x27;s south gate. Around that time Anacostia–Bolling parents have advocated establishing a charter school for secondary grades on Anacostia–Bolling so they do not have to enroll their children in faraway schools. They perceived the public secondary schools as being of low quality; around that time about 20% of the students in the local schools had adequate or higher performance in mathematics and reading.

In 2021 the LEARN Charter Schools organization signed an agreement to lease space at JBAB. It was scheduled to begin operations in Fall 2021 and is to expand to be a PreK-8 school.

<text>Raynal Cawthorne Bolling (September 1, 1877 – March 26, 1918) was the first high-ranking officer of the United States Army to be killed in combat in World War I. A corporate lawyer by vocation, he became an early Army aviator and the organizer of both of the first units in what ultimately became the Air National Guard and the Air Force Reserve Command.

Sent to France to lay a foundation for the Air Service of the American Expeditionary Force as head of what became known as the &quot;Bolling Mission,&quot; he remained in France instead of returning to the United States, served briefly in a number of staff positions and was selected for a future combat command. He was touring his future area of operations to learn the nature of the work he would be expected to perform when he was killed in action by German troops during the opening days of the 1918 spring offensive. He was the namesake of Bolling Air Force Base.

==Biography==
Bolling was born in Hot Springs, Arkansas, and was a resident of Greenwich, Connecticut, from 1911 until 1915. In 1912, he commissioned Carrère and Hastings, the architects of the New York Public Library, to build an estate for him at 137 Doubling Road in Greenwich that he later named &quot;Greyledge&quot;. Greyledge was constructed between 1912 and 1914. Greyledge was an English-style manor situated on an estate that sprawls from 137 Doubling Road to Boulder Brook. In addition to a sitting room, family room, library and thirteen fireplaces, the estate was also home to a shooting gallery. Upon completion in 1914 Colonel Raynal Bolling and Anna Tucker Phillips Bolling moved in to Greyledge with their family of four daughters and one son. However, Bolling spent virtually no time enjoying his family and new home. In November 1915, Bolling, then a First Lieutenant in the Air Force, was appointed to the New York National Guard. The estate was later razed, in 2007, by its current owner despite a public outcry. 
He attended the Penn Charter School in Philadelphia, graduating in 1896. He graduated from Harvard College in the class of 1900 and from the Harvard Law School in 1902.

Bolling was an attorney at Guthrie, Cravath, and Henderson. A little after a year there he began his career in the legal department of the United States Steel Corporation. By 1907 he was assistant general solicitor and married Anna Tucker Phillips, June 25, 1907, in Beverly, Massachusetts. She was the sister of William Phillips, a prominent career diplomat. He also joined the New York National Guard. He and his wife had four daughters and a son, one of whom, Cecelia Raynal Bolling, died in infancy. In 1913 he was named general counsel of US Steel at the age of 36.

==Military service==
===National guard aviation pioneer===
In the summer of 1915 Bolling, along with his brother-in-law and seven New York businessmen, all members of the American Aero Club, began taking flying lessons on property owned by the Wright Company near Garden City, New York. They contracted with an aviation school operated by Edson and Herbert Gallaudet for the use of their Gallaudet C-2 dual-controls trainer, which had a 50-horsepower Gnome motor, and the services of 20-year-old Peter Carl &quot;Tex&quot; Millman as an instructor. By the end of July, Millman reported several of his students including Bolling were ready to try for their American Aero Club license.

Bolling was in sympathy with the objectives of the Preparedness Movement, a group of influential Americans advocating military preparedness for involvement in World War I and drawn primarily from wealthy lawyers, bankers, academics, and politicians of the Northeast. Starting August 10, he was a participant in the first &quot;Business Men&#x27;s Camp&quot;, a volunteer summer military training camp organized and funded by the Preparedness Movement in Plattsburgh, New York, with the encouragement of Major General Leonard Wood, commanding the Army&#x27;s Eastern Department. There he organized a &quot;motor machine gun troop&quot; and arranged for Millman to fly Gallaudet&#x27;s C-2, re-engined with a 100-horsepower Gnome and termed the &quot;Military Tractor,&quot; from the camp to demonstrate its military usefulness. Despite a long delay caused by lack of a safe landing ground nearby, Millman made 20 flights over a three-day period. Bolling also arranged for use of the American Aero Club&#x27;s six-person balloon, the &quot;America III&quot;, to make a demonstration for the trainees.

In September, after the Plattsburgh encampment was over, Bolling began preparations for organizing an aero company for the guard. He secured the services of three additional flying instructors and began recruiting personnel. He received $12,500 in funding from the Aero Club of America (ACA) The funds provided Bolling were donated anonymously by two wealthy New Yorkers, including William K. Vanderbilt, specifically to establish a unit for the NY Guard. and rented both the &quot;Military Tractor&quot; and Gallaudet&#x27;s earlier prototype, the C-1. Authorization to form an aviation section in the Signal Corps of the Guard was announced by New York Governor Charles S. Whitman in October, and Bolling, who had just completed his flying instruction, was then appointed to the ACA&#x27;s special committee to support its implementation.

In November 1915, Bolling was appointed as a first lieutenant in the New York National Guard and organized the &quot;Aviation Detachment, First Battalion Signal Corps, National Guard, New York.&quot; During the winter of 1915-1916, when it reached its authorized strength of four officers and 40 enlisted men, the detachment was designated the &quot;1st Aero Company&quot; and was the first national guard aviation unit in the United States. The pilots of the company were prominent young New Yorkers, many of whom had already had some flight instruction over the summer. Within a month, half of the 48 states had applied to the ACA for financial assistance in purchasing aircraft and equipment.
Flying instruction began immediately at Garden City Aerodrome, with 56 flights in November alone. Throughout the winter of 1915-1916 the 1st Aero Company conducted flying operations, but by April continuing bad weather and engine problems slowed progress in training. The company returned its rented trainers to Gallaudet and acquired five more of disparate manufacture and age, including purchase of a Curtiss JN-4 &quot;Jenny&quot;. In addition, the company attended weekly classes in aircraft engines and the theory of aviation at the Columbia School Of Engineering.

The company, commanded by now-Captain Bolling, was mustered into federal service on July 13, 1916, and began a five-week encampment. The Army opened the &quot;Signal Corps Aviation Station, Mineola&quot; at the Garden City Aerodrome on July 22 and the 1st Aero Company received regulation training from two regulars, 1st Lieutenants Joseph E. Carberry and Walter G. Kilner, both veterans of the Punitive expedition in Mexico with the 1st Aero Squadron. On August 1 the aviation school received the first of forty new aircraft to be delivered over the next eight months, most of them Curtiss Jennies, authorization to buy fuel, and to hire three civilian instructors and seven mechanics as staff. In addition to the 1st Aero Company, the newly formed 2nd Aero Company NYNG also arrived for training (but was not federalized or subject to Carberry&#x27;s orders), as did 14 officers from the guards of other states, all of which enabled the company to train as a unit. Bolling passed a flying test for an expert pilot&#x27;s license on October 25, receiving Fédération Aéronautique Internationale certificate No. 536, and passed the Reserve Military Aviator (RMA) qualification test.

Intended for service in Mexico, the 1st Aero Company never left Long Island but did train 25 of its own members as pilots before mustering out of federal service in November 1916. It is recognized as the Air National Guard&#x27;s oldest unit and its lineage is carried by the 102d Rescue Squadron, New York ANG. The increasing numbers of Army aircraft at Mineola enabled the company to continue flying even after it returned to the jurisdiction of the national guard.

At the same time as these events involving Bolling&#x27;s unit, a parallel private pilot training program was underway. After American troops under General John J. Pershing entered Mexico in March 1916, a group of wealthy New Yorkers underwrote another school at nearby Fort Jay in New York City. The organizer was attorney Phillip A. Carroll, who had been one of the nine men trained by Millman the previous summer. Called the Governors Island Training Corps, the small group of candidates began instruction on May 2. They trained daily under the authority of and in conformance with regulations set down by General Wood with the goal of passing the RMA test and being commissioned in the new aviation section of the Signal Reserve Corps. Ultimately 17 men participated, ten completed the course, and seven including Carroll received ratings and commissions by May 1917.

In its second winter of operations but no longer under federal control, the 1st Aero Company continued training flights in conjunction with the small force of reserve candidates flying from Governors Island. On November 18, 1916, Bolling led a flight of seven Jennies from Mineola to New York harbor, where they were joined by a pair of JN-4s from the Governors Island school. One of Carroll&#x27;s instructors in his own plane accompanied the group as the ten airplanes flew cross country together to Princeton, New Jersey, to attend the Yale-Princeton football game, the largest such formation of airplanes to date. In one of its final tactical maneuvers, led by Bolling on March 8, 1917, the 1st Aero Company participated in an exercise that involved 25 aircraft and half of the company&#x27;s 44 personnel, simulating battlefield reconnaissance of camouflaged equipment and fortifications, and smoke from a simulated artillery battery. Despite their achievements, Bolling&#x27;s report to the Chief of the Militia Bureau concluded that the development of national guard aviation was not practical at that time because of difficulties in attracting skilled mechanics into the guard to maintain the aircraft. As a result, and because of a curtailment of federal funding for the project, the War Department decided not to use national guard aero squadrons for service in the war. The 1st Aero Company was disbanded on May 23, 1917.

By that time the United States was at war with Germany. Bolling was called to active duty as a major in the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps on April 27, 1917, &quot;for duty in connection with the organization of the 1st Reserve Aero Squadron,&quot; pursuant to authorization of the National Defense Act of 1916. On May 26, 1917, shortly after the national guard company was disbanded, he organized the new 154-man squadron, the first air reserve unit in the United States. The squadron became the 26th Aero Squadron after it deployed to France and had as its cadre the former guardsmen of the 1st Aero Company and the reserve military aviators with whom Bolling had trained in 1916-17.

===World War I===
Before Bolling could actually take command of his unit, he was detached in June 1917 for staff duty. French premier Alexandre Ribot had sent U.S. President Woodrow Wilson a telegram at the end of May urging the United States to contribute 4,500 aircraft; 5,000 pilots; and 50,000 mechanics to the war effort. Because of his legal experience Bolling was assigned to assist in the drafting of legislation to fund the development of military aviation in response to Ribot&#x27;s proposal. The subsequent Aviation Act (40 &quot;Stat&quot;. 243), passed July 24, 1917, was the largest single appropriation for a single purpose to that time, $640 million.

In conjunction with that duty, he was also appointed to the advisory Aircraft Production Board of the Council of National Defense to head an aeronautical commission to Europe known as &quot;the Bolling Mission,&quot; to represent Secretary of War Newton D. Baker and the Board. His commission consisted of himself, two Army pilots trained in aeronautical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, two naval officers, seven civilian industrial experts, and 93 civilian manufacturing technicians. The commission was charged with studying the types of military aircraft being used by the Allied Powers, recommend types to be put into production in the United States, and determine what types should be purchased directly from European sources. Bolling was chosen for his business and legal skills in negotiating prices and royalties. The commission left for Europe on June 17, 1917, and arrived in Liverpool on June 26. After a week in London, where its members fanned out to English airfields and aircraft factories, the commission repeated the process in Paris for two weeks, Italy for ten days, and then returned to Paris. Bolling took advantage of his mission&#x27;s &quot;quasi-diplomatic&quot; status and his brother-in-law&#x27;s authority as an Assistant Secretary of State to communicate with Washington using the State Department&#x27;s transatlantic telegraph cable.

Bolling reported to the Chief Signal Officer from Paris on August 15 and recommended that the United States send materials, engines, and parts for assembly of airplanes in Europe. To accelerate the number of American pilots, the report recommended that the best cadets then in ground schools be shipped to France to complete their primary flight training under French instructors. The report further recommended an air force of &quot;fighting airplanes and bombers&quot; well beyond the numbers of airplanes providing auxiliary support of ground forces by observation. In particular Bolling and his Army colleagues, Captains Edgar S. Gorrell and Virginius E. Clark, were impressed by the concept of long-range strategic bombing, influenced by the Italian use of Caproni bombers against Austrian targets. It was one of a number of aircraft the commission recommended for manufacture by American industry, including the Bristol and SPAD VII fighters, but of its recommendations, only the deHavilland DH-4 was suitable for American production methods or engines and thus built in quantity before the war ended. Bolling prepared the preliminary aeronautical contract with the French, calling for delivery of 5,000 airplanes by July 1, 1918, which was signed on August 30, 1917, by the French air minister and General Pershing, now in command of the American Expeditionary Force.

Following his work with the commission, Bolling joined Col. Billy Mitchell&#x27;s aviation headquarters in Paris, which was still being organized, as Chief, Zone of the Interior, Air Service. On September 3, 1917, Pershing created the Air Service of the American Expeditionary Force and chose Bolling to become Director of Air Service Supply, to administer the Air Service Zone of the Lines of Communication. Bolling was promoted to colonel and his duties were a continuation of those under Mitchell: the supervision of training, the administration of personnel records, the operation of Air Service lines of communication (supply), the activities of the Balloon Division, and the establishment of training schools and air depots for equipment and repair. The most important sections of his new office were those which performed flying training, all balloon activities, and aerial photography units. One of his first tasks was the accelerated construction of a large flying school at Issoudun to provide advanced training to cadets completing their preliminary instruction in France, as he had earlier recommended.

On November 17, 1917, the headquarters of the Air Service AEF underwent a shakeup when its new commander, General Benjamin Foulois, arrived from Washington, D.C., with a large staff and displaced all the existing members. Bolling was relieved by Foulois and assigned to be chairman of the Joint Army-Navy Aircraft Committee, ostensibly to coordinate the activities of the military and the aviation industry in procuring aircraft. He was also Pershing&#x27;s nominal aviation representative on the Supreme War Council; however, Foulois sat on both these committees. The assignment proved frustrating as his staff work and proposals were often undermined by competing interests, political in-fighting, and administrative delays. Bolling sought a combat command and was picked to become chief of air service for the U.S. II Corps when it formed in the spring. To prepare himself he visited aerodromes of the Royal Flying Corps in the vicinity of Amiens in March 1918 to observe air operations in support of the British Expeditionary Force during the German spring offensive.

==Death==
On the morning of March 26, 1918, during the opening phase of the offensive, Bolling and his driver, Private Paul L. Holder of the 22nd Aero Squadron, left their hotel in Amiens, headed for the British aerodrome at Harbonnières. They found it deserted and continued driving east toward the front lines, where they encountered three British Army officers in Estrées-Deniécourt, including a major with whom Bolling had an acquaintance. The officers indicated that to the best of their knowledge the oncoming German forces were still five kilometers distant. With this assurance, they headed towards a hill about 2.5 km away from which they might be able to observe the battlefield. Only Bolling was armed, and that an officer&#x27;s service revolver.

After driving only 300 meters, their car was ambushed by hidden German machine guns on both sides of the Amiens-Saint-Quentin Road (). Before Holder could turn the car around, German fire disabled its motor. Holder and Bolling took cover in separate shell holes, which were connected by a ditch that enabled Bolling to see Holder. The fire of the machine guns lasted fifteen minutes, after which two German soldiers approached Holder&#x27;s position. When one of them fired twice at the unarmed Holder crouching in his hole, Bolling shot and killed the German with his revolver. The other soldier killed Bolling with two shots, one to the chest and the other to the head.

The German troops continued west, and while Holder pretended to be dead in hope of escaping through the lines after dark, he was captured a half-hour later by follow-on troops and made a prisoner of war. Bolling was the first high-ranking air service officer killed on the battlefield in World War I. His remains were never recovered.

==Legacy==

Bolling was posthumously awarded the Legion of Honour by the French government and the Distinguished Service Medal by the United States Army. The sculptor Edward Clark Potter created a life-size statue of Bolling that was cast in bronze by the Gorham Foundry of Rhode Island for permanent display near the town commons of Greenwich, Connecticut. The Indiana limestone background of the memorial shows aircraft in combat in low relief. Bolling is honored at the Memorial Church of Harvard University and by &quot;Bolling Grove,&quot; a redwood grove on the Avenue of the Giants, paralleling U.S. Highway 101 along the South Fork of the Eel River in Humboldt Redwoods State Park, California.

Bolling Field, District of Columbia, now a part of Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, was opened on July 1, 1918, and named to commemorate Bolling.

<doc id="373956" wikidata="Q2713184" url="?curid=373956" title="Law of trichotomy">
<text>In mathematics, the law of trichotomy states that every real number is either positive, negative, or zero.

More generally, a binary relation &quot;R&quot; on a set &quot;X&quot; is trichotomous if for all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in &quot;X&quot;, exactly one of &quot;xRy&quot;, &quot;yRx&quot; and &quot;x&quot;=&quot;y&quot; holds. Writing &quot;R&quot; as &lt;, this is stated in formal logic as:
:formula_1
With this definition, the law of trichotomy states that &lt; is trichotomous relation on the set of real numbers.
In other words, if &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are real numbers, then exactly one of the following must be true: &quot;x&quot;&lt;&quot;y&quot;, &quot;x&quot;=&quot;y&quot;, &quot;y&quot;&lt;&quot;x&quot;.

==Properties==
* A relation is trichotomous if, and only if, it is asymmetric and connected.
* If a trichotomous relation is also transitive, then it is a strict total order; this is a special case of a strict weak order.

==Examples==
* On the set &quot;X&quot; = {&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;}, the relation &quot;R&quot; = { (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;), (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;c&quot;), (&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;) } is transitive and trichotomous, and hence a strict total order.
* On the same set, the cyclic relation &quot;R&quot; = { (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;), (&quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;), (&quot;c&quot;,&quot;a&quot;) } is trichotomous, but not transitive; it is even antitransitive.

==Trichotomy on numbers==
A law of trichotomy on some set &quot;X&quot; of numbers usually expresses that some tacitly given ordering relation on &quot;X&quot; is a trichotomous one. An example is the law &quot;For arbitrary real numbers &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, exactly one of &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;y&quot;, &quot;y&quot; &lt; &quot;x&quot;, or &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot; applies&quot;; some authors even fix &quot;y&quot; to be zero, relying on the real number&#x27;s additive linearly ordered group structure. The latter is a group equipped with a trichotomous order.

In classical logic, this axiom of trichotomy holds for ordinary comparison between real numbers and therefore also for comparisons between integers and between rational numbers. The law does not hold in general in intuitionistic logic.

In Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory and Bernays set theory, the law of trichotomy holds between the cardinal numbers of well-orderable sets even without the axiom of choice. If the axiom of choice holds, then trichotomy holds between arbitrary cardinal numbers (because they are all well-orderable in that case).

<doc id="373961" wikidata="Q7231650" url="?curid=373961" title="Porter Rockwell">
<text>Orrin Porter Rockwell (June 28, 1813 or June 25, 1815 – June 9, 1878) was a figure of the Wild West period of American history. A lawman in the Utah Territory, he was nicknamed &quot;Old Port&quot;, &quot;The Destroying Angel of Mormondom&quot; and &quot;Modern-day Samson&quot;.

Rockwell served as a bodyguard, and was a personal friend, of Latter Day Saint movement founder Joseph Smith. After Smith&#x27;s death in 1844, Rockwell became a bodyguard of his successor, Brigham Young, and traveled with him and members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) to the Salt Lake Valley in the present-day U.S. state of Utah.

==Early years==
Rockwell was born in what was known as the &quot;Dark Corner&quot; section of Belchertown, Hampshire County, Massachusetts, to Orin and Sarah Witt Rockwell, on June 25, 1813. Orin Rockwell came from Tolland, Connecticut, arriving in Belchertown by 1809, where he married Sarah Witt who was born here. Both were swept up in the religious fervor of the Second Great Awakening. 

By coincidence, Ethan Smith (1762-1849), an influential clergyman unrelated to Latter Day Saint movement founder Joseph Smith but whose writings likely influenced the church, was born in Belchertown 50 years before Porter Rockwell. 

At age 4, in about 1817, Rockwell moved with his family to western New York&#x27;s Burned-over district, to Manchester and Palmyra. They became neighbors of the Smith family, who had moved there from Vermont the year before.

Rockwell was said to be related to Joseph Smith through a &quot;jumble of ancestral lines&quot; through his paternal grandmother, Irene Porter, who descended from John Porter and Ann White, &quot;progenitors of the Mormon prophet.&quot;

Rockwell was eight years younger than Smith. While Smith was publishing the Book of Mormon, Rockwell picked berries at night and hauled wood into town to help pay for the publishing.

In 1830, at 16 years old, Rockwell was baptized into Smith&#x27;s Church of Christ in Fayette, New York. Historically, the date of Rockwell&#x27;s baptism is April 6, the day the church was organized, but original documents suggest a probable date of June 9. Rockwell was the youngest member of the first group to be baptized into the church.

On February 2, 1832, Rockwell married Luana Beebe in Jackson County, Missouri, and was endowed in the Nauvoo Temple on January 5, 1846.

Rockwell killed many men as a gunfighter, a religious enforcer, and Deputy United States Marshal. According to legend, Rockwell told a crowd listening to United States vice president Schuyler Colfax in 1869, &quot;I never killed anyone who didn&#x27;t need killing&quot;, a quote used by actor John Wayne in a movie decades later.

==Boggs attempted assassination accusation==

On the evening of May 6, 1842, Lilburn Boggs was shot by an unknown party who fired at him through a window as he read a newspaper in his study. He was badly wounded but survived. Boggs was the governor of Missouri who had signed the Executive Order 44 on October 27, 1838, known as the &quot;Extermination Order&quot; evicting Mormons from Missouri by violent and deadly means.
The &quot;Sangamo Journal&quot; published by John C. Bennett, a recently excommunicated Mormon who, prior to the assassination, had served as mayor of Nauvoo, Major General of the Nauvoo Legion, and Chancellor of the University of Nauvoo.

Bennett implicated Rockwell in the assassination attempt, writing:
:&quot;In 1841, Joe Smith predicted or prophesied in a public congregation in Nauvoo, that Lilburn W Boggs, ex-Governor of Missouri, should die by violent hands within one year. From one or two months prior to the attempted assassination of Gov. Boggs, Mr. O. P. Rockwell left Nauvoo for parts unknown to the citizens at large. I was then on terms of close intimacy with Joe Smith, and asked him where Rockwell had gone? &quot;Gone,&quot; said he, &quot;GONE TO FULFILL PROPHECY!&quot; Rockwell returned to Nauvoo the day before the report of the assassination reached there.&quot;

Smith and his supporters vehemently denied Bennett&#x27;s account.

Rockwell was apprehended in St. Louis on March 6, 1843. In late May, Rockwell briefly escaped from the Independence jail where he was being held.

On September 30, 1843, it was reported:
: &quot;Orin Porter Rockwell, the Mormon confined in our county jail some time since for the attempted assassination of ex-governor Boggs, was indicted by our last grand jury for escaping from the county jail some weeks since, and sent to Clay county for trial. Owing, however, to some informality in the proceedings, he was remanded to this county again for trial. There was not sufficient proof adduced against him to justify an indictment for shooting ex-Governor Boggs; and the grand jury, therefore, did not indict him for that offence.&quot;

Though never indicted for the attempted assassination, Rockwell was tried and convicted of jailbreak. Rockwell was released on December 13, 1843—ten months after his arrest.

==Nauvoo Years==
The morning of September 16, 1845, Lieutenant Frank Worrell of the nearby Carthage militia was shot and killed by Rockwell after refusing an order to stop by non-Mormon Sherriff William Backenstos. Worrell had been the sergeant of the guard at Carthage when the Smiths were assassinated.

==Utah years==
Following Smith&#x27;s death, Rockwell followed Brigham Young and the LDS Church to the Salt Lake Valley. In 1849, Rockwell was appointed as deputy marshal of Great Salt Lake City, and remained a peace officer until his death. He was well known for his endurance, loyalty, and relentlessness.

On April 21st 1851, a group of Goshute confiscated some horses that had invaded their territory near Benson Grist Mill. General Daniel H. Wells sent a posse led by Rockwell to pursue the Goshute. They lost the trail of the Goshute that had taken the horses and encountered another group of 20 or 30 people belonging to the Ute tribe, whom they took prisoner but did not disarm. When some of the captured Goshute tried to escape, one was shot by Custer, a non-Mormon member of the posse. Custer was then shot by one of the Native Americans, who was in turn shot by another posse member. All but four or five prisoners escaped, those that didn&#x27;t escape were executed by Rockwell on April 22nd.

Rockwell operated the Hot Springs Hotel and Brewery at the southern end of the Salt Lake Valley, in an area known as &quot;Point of the Mountain&quot;.

Rockwell&#x27;s fame as a &quot;mountain man&quot; attracted the explorer, Richard Francis Burton. In 1860, on his trip across America to the west coast, Burton stopped to explore the Salt Lake City area. He stayed with Lysander Dayton in a village near the city, and Dayton invited Rockwell to dinner. Rockwell sent for a bottle of Valley Tan Whiskey, and he and Burton drank shot-for-shot into the night, with Rockwell outlining steps Burton should take for safety during his passage to Sacramento. Rockwell advised Burton to carry a loaded double-barreled shotgun, sleep in a &quot;dark camp&quot; (unlit, miles from where supper was cooked), to never trust appearances, and to avoid the main trail, where &quot;White Indians&quot; (so-called because they were white robbers disguised as Indians to avert blame) preyed on travelers.

==Death==
Rockwell died in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, of natural causes on June 9, 1878. He was buried in the Salt Lake City Cemetery. At the time of his death, Rockwell had been a baptized Latter-day Saint longer than anyone living. His epitaph reads:

He was brave and loyal to his faith. True to the Prophet Joseph Smith. A promise made him by the prophet. Through obedience, it was fulfilled.
At Rockwell&#x27;s funeral, which was held at the Salt Lake City 14th Ward school house, apostle Joseph F. Smith, nephew of Joseph Smith and future church president, spoke the following about Rockwell:

They say he was a murderer; if he was, he was the friend of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, and he was faithful to them, and to his covenants, and he has gone to Heaven and apostates can go to Hell ... Porter Rockwell was yesterday afternoon ushered into Heaven clothed with immortality and eternal life, and crowned with all glory which belongs to a departed saint. He has his little faults, but Porter&#x27;s life on earth, taken altogether, was one worthy of example, and reflected honor upon the church. Through all his trials, he never once forgot his obligations to his brethren and his God.

However, not all reactions to Rockwell&#x27;s death were positive. On June 11, 1878, the &quot;Salt Lake Tribune&quot; stated, &quot;Porter Rockwell is another of the long list of Mormon criminals whose deeds of treachery and blood have reddened the soil of Utah, and who has paid no forfeit to offended law.&quot;

==Legacy==
Rockwell fathered 21 children with three different wives. He had the distinction of being the subject of a direct prophecy by Smith. After spending eight months in jail on charges of attempting to assassinate Boggs, Rockwell traveled to Nauvoo, appearing unannounced at a Christmas party at Smith&#x27;s home. After his identity was confirmed, Smith was moved to say:

I prophesy, in the name of the Lord, you—Orrin Porter Rockwell—so long as ye shall remain loyal and true to thy faith, need fear no enemy. Cut not thy hair, and no bullet or blade can harm thee.

The promise echoes one given by an angel to the parents of the biblical Samson.

Rockwell, at one time, cut his hair. After hearing of a balding widow with typhoid fever, he offered his famous long hair to make a wig. The recipient of the hair was Agnes Coolbrith Smith Pickett, widow of Smith&#x27;s brother, Don Carlos.

The Porter Rockwell Trail is a walking trail that spans Lehi, Draper, White City, and Sandy.

==Cultural influence==
Two statues of Rockwell exist: one near the old site of his Hot Springs Hotel and Brewery near the Utah State Penitentiary, the other in Lehi, Utah, off of Main Street behind. 

In 1971, the restaurant &quot;Porter&#x27;s Place&quot; was opened on Lehi Main Street but later in 2018, it moved to Eureka, Utah, and eventually closed permanently.

Three comprehensive biographies have been written about Rockwell. &quot;Orrin Porter Rockwell: Man of God, Son of Thunder&quot; by Harold Schindler, &quot;Porter Rockwell: A Biography&quot; by Richard Lloyd Dewey, and &quot;Stories from the Life of Porter Rockwell&quot; by John Rockwell.

Rockwell&#x27;s life was examined on &quot;The Dollop&quot;, a comedic podcast that examines American history, in episode #74.

Rockwell&#x27;s life was examined again on &quot;Let Them Fight: A Comedy History Podcast&quot;, which examines violent people throughout all history, in episode #120.

<text>The United States Department of War, also called the War Department (and occasionally War Office in the early years), was the United States Cabinet department originally responsible for the operation and maintenance of the United States Army, also bearing responsibility for naval affairs until the establishment of the Navy Department in 1798, and for most land-based air forces until the creation of the Department of the Air Force on September 18, 1947.

The secretary of war, a civilian with such responsibilities as finance and purchases and a minor role in directing military affairs, headed the War Department throughout its existence.

The War Department existed from August 7, 1789 until September 18, 1947, when it split into the Department of the Army and the Department of the Air Force. The Department of the Army and Department of the Air Force later joined the Department of the Navy under the United States Department of Defense in 1949.

==History==


===18th century===
The Department of War traces its origins to the committees created by the Second Continental Congress in 1775 to oversee the Revolutionary War. Individual committees were formed for each issue, including committees to secure ammunition, to raise funds for gunpowder, and to organize a national militia. These committees were consolidated into the Board of War and Ordnance in 1776, operated by members of Congress. A second board was created in 1777, the Board of War, to operate separately from Congress. The Congress of the Confederation eventually replaced the system of boards with the Department of War. Only five positions were created within the department upon its creation: the Secretary at War, an assistant, a secretary, and two clerks.

Shortly after the establishment of a government under President George Washington in 1789, Congress reestablished the War Department as a civilian agency to administer the field army under the president (as commander-in-chief) and the secretary of war. Retired senior General Henry Knox, then in civilian life, served as the first United States Secretary of War. When the department was created, the president was authorized to appoint two inspectors to oversee the troops. Congress created several additional offices over the course of the 1790s, including the major general, brigadier general, quartermaster general, chaplain, surgeon general, adjutant general, superintendent of military stores, paymaster general, judge advocate, inspector general, physician general, apothecary general, purveyor, and accountant.

Forming and organizing the department and the army fell to Secretary Knox, while direct field command of the small Regular Army fell to President Washington. In 1798, Congress authorized President John Adams to create a second provisional army under the command of former president Washington in anticipation of the Quasi-War, but this army was never utilized. The Department of War was also responsible for overseeing interactions with Native Americans in its early years.

On November 8, 1800, the War Department building with its records and files was consumed by fire.

===19th century===
The United States Military Academy at West Point and the Army Corps of Engineers were established in 1802. The Department of War was reduced in size following the end of the Quasi-War in 1802, but it was subsequently expanded in the years leading up to the War of 1812. To accommodate this expansion, sub-departments were created within the department, with each one led by a general staff officer. These sub-departments were reformed into a modern system of bureaus by Secretary of War John C. Calhoun in 1818. Secretary Calhoun created the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1824, which served as the main agency within the War Department for addressing the issues regarding Native Americans until 1849, when Congress transferred it to the newly founded Department of the Interior. The U.S. Soldiers&#x27; Home was created in 1851.

During the American Civil War, the War Department responsibilities expanded. It handled the recruiting, training, supply, medical care, transportation and pay of two million soldiers, comprising both the regular army and the much larger temporary volunteer army. A separate command structure took charge of military operations.

In the late stages of the war, the department took charge of refugees and freedmen (freed slaves) in the American South through the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands. During the Reconstruction era, this bureau played a major role in supporting the new Republican governments in the southern states. When military Reconstruction ended in 1877, the U.S. Army removed the last troops from military occupation of the American South, and the last Republican state governments in the region ended.

The Army comprised hundreds of small detachments in forts around the West, dealing with Indians, and in coastal artillery units in port cities, dealing with the threat of a naval attack.

===1898–1939===
The United States Army, with 39,000 men in 1890 was the smallest and least powerful army of any major power in the late 19th century. By contrast, France had an army of 542,000. Temporary volunteers and state militia units mostly fought the Spanish–American War of 1898. This conflict demonstrated the need for more effective control over the department and its bureaus.

Secretary of War Elihu Root (1899–1904) sought to appoint a chief of staff as general manager and a European-type general staff for planning, aiming to achieve this goal in a businesslike manner, but General Nelson A. Miles stymied his efforts. Root enlarged the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York and established the United States Army War College and the General Staff. He changed the procedures for promotions and organized schools for the special branches of the service. He also devised the principle of rotating officers from staff to line. Concerned about the new territories acquired after the Spanish–American War, Root worked out the procedures for turning Cuba over to the Cubans, wrote the charter of government for the Philippines, and eliminated tariffs on goods imported to the United States from Puerto Rico.

Root&#x27;s successor as Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, returned to the traditional secretary-bureau chief alliance, subordinating the chief of staff to the adjutant general, a powerful office since its creation in 1775. Indeed, Secretary Taft exercised little power; President Theodore Roosevelt made the major decisions. In 1911, Secretary Henry L. Stimson and Major General Leonard Wood, his chief of staff, revived the Root reforms. The general staff assisted them in their efforts to rationalize the organization of the army along modern lines and in supervising the bureaus.

===World War I===
The Congress reversed these changes in support of the bureaus and in the National Defense Act of 1916 reduced the size and functions of the general staff to few members before America entered World War I on April 6, 1917. President Woodrow Wilson supported Secretary of War Newton D. Baker, who opposed efforts to control the bureaus and war industry until competition for limited supplies almost paralyzed industry and transportation, especially in the North. Yielding to pressure from Congress and industry, Secretary Baker placed Benedict Crowell in charge of munitions and made Major General George W. Goethals acting quartermaster general and General Peyton C. March chief of staff. Assisted by industrial advisers, they reorganized the supply system of the army and practically wiped out the bureaus as quasi-independent agencies. General March reorganized the general staff along similar lines and gave it direct authority over departmental operations. After the war, the Congress again granted the bureaus their former independence. The Commission on Training Camp Activities addressed moral standards of the troops.

In the 1920s, General John J. Pershing realigned the general staff on the pattern of his American Expeditionary Force (AEF) field headquarters, which he commanded. The general staff in the early 1920s exercised little effective control over the bureaus, but the chiefs of staff gradually gained substantial authority over them by 1939, when General George C. Marshall assumed the office of Army chief of staff.

===World War II===
During World War II, General Marshall principally advised President Franklin D. Roosevelt on military strategy and expended little effort in acting as general manager of the Department of War. Many agencies still fragmented authority, burdening the chief of staff with too many details, making the whole Department of War poorly geared toward directing the army in a global war. General Marshall described the chief of staff then as a &quot;poor command post.&quot; President Roosevelt brought in Henry L. Stimson as Secretary of War; after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Stimson supported Marshall in reorganizing the army under the War Powers Act of 1941. He divided the Army of the United States (AUS) into three autonomous components to conduct the operations of the War Department: the Army Ground Forces (AGF) trained land troops; the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF) developed an independent air arm; and the Services of Supply (later Army Service Forces) directed administrative and logistical operations. The Operations Division acted as general planning staff for Marshall. By 1942, the Army Air Forces gained virtual independence in every way from the rest of the army.

===Postwar===
After World War II, the Department of War abandoned Marshall&#x27;s organization for the fragmented prewar pattern while the independent services continually parried efforts to reestablish firm executive control over their operations. The National Security Act of 1947 split the War Department into the Department of the Army and the Department of the Air Force, and the secretary of the Army and secretary of the Air Force served as operating managers for the new secretary of defense.

==Office space==

In the early years, between 1797 and 1800, the Department of War was headquartered in Philadelphia; it moved with the other federal agencies to the new national capital at Washington, D.C., in 1800. In 1820, headquarters moved into a building at 17th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW, adjacent to the Executive Mansion, part of a complex of four matching brick Georgian/Federal style buildings for Cabinet departments with War in the northwest, Navy in the southwest and to the other side: State to the northeast and Treasury in the southeast. The War Department building was supplemented in the 1850s by a building across the street to the west known as the Annex and became very important during the Civil War with President Abraham Lincoln visiting the War Office&#x27;s telegraph room for constant updates and reports and walking back and forth to the &quot;Residence&quot;. The original 1820 structures for War and Navy on the west side of the now famous White House was replaced in 1888 by construction of a new building of French Empire design with mansard roofs, the &quot;State, War, and Navy Building&quot; (now the Old Executive Office Building, and later renamed to honor General and President Dwight D. Eisenhower), built in the same location as its predecessors.

By the 1930s, the Department of State squeezed the War Department from its office space, and the White House also desired additional office space. In August 1939, Secretary of War Harry H. Woodring and Acting Chief of Staff of the Army George C. Marshall moved their offices into the Munitions Building, a temporary structure built on the National Mall during World War I. In the late 1930s, the government constructed the War Department Building (renamed in 2000 as the Harry S Truman Building) at 21st and C Streets in Foggy Bottom, but upon completion, the new building did not solve the space problem of the department, and the Department of State ultimately used it.

Coming into office with World War II raging in Europe and Asia, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson faced with the situation of the War Department spread through the overcrowded Munitions Building and numerous other buildings across Washington, D.C., and suburban Maryland and Virginia. On July 28, 1941, Congress authorized funding for a new Department of War building in Arlington, Virginia, which would house the entire department under one roof. When construction of the Pentagon was completed in 1943, the Secretary of War vacated the Munitions Building and the department began moving into the Pentagon.

==Organization==
The United States secretary of war, a member of the United States Cabinet, headed the War Department.

The National Security Act of 1947 established the &quot;National Military Establishment&quot;, later renamed the United States Department of Defense. On the same day this act was signed, Executive Order 9877 assigned primary military functions and responsibilities with the former War Department split between the Department of the Army and Department of the Air Force.

In the aftermath of World War II, the American government (among others around the world) decided to abandon the word &#x27;War&#x27; when referring to the civilian leadership of their military. One vestige of the former nomenclature is the names of the service was colleges: the Army War College, the Naval War College, and the Air War College, which still train U.S. military officers in battlefield tactics and the strategy of war fighting.

==Seal of the department==
The date &quot;MDCCLXXVIII&quot; and the designation &quot;War Office&quot; are indicative of the origin of the seal. The date (1778) refers to the year of its adoption. The term &quot;War Office&quot; used during the Revolution, and for many years afterward, was associated with the Headquarters of the Army.

<doc id="373963" wikidata="Q98108964" url="?curid=373963" title="Owner-occupancy">
<text>Owner-occupancy or home-ownership is a form of housing tenure in which a person, called the owner-occupier, owner-occupant, or home owner, owns the home in which they live. The home can be a house, such as a single-family house, an apartment, condominium, or a housing cooperative. In addition to providing housing, owner-occupancy also functions as a real estate investment.

== Acquisition ==
Some homes are constructed by the owners with the intent to occupy. Many are inherited. A large number are purchased, as new homes from a real estate developer or as an existing home from a previous landlord or owner-occupier.

A house is usually the most expensive single purchase an individual or family makes, and often costs several times the annual household income. Given the high cost, most individuals do not have enough savings on hand to pay the entire amount outright. In developed countries, mortgage loans are available from financial institutions in return for interest. If the home owner fails to meet the agreed repayment schedule, a foreclosure (known as a repossession in some countries) may result.

Many countries offer aid to prospective homebuyers to make their purchases. These measures include grants, subsidized mortgages, and mortgage guarantees. Prospective homebuyers may have to meet certain qualifications to qualify for government aid, such as being a first-time homebuyer or having an income below a certain threshold.

== Pros and cons ==
Home ownership gives occupants the right to modify the building and land as they please (subject to government, homeowner association, and deed restrictions), protects them from eviction, and creates a right to occupation which can be inherited. In some jurisdictions, it also confers certain legal rights with regard to abutters.

Houses and the land they sit on are expensive, and the combination of monthly mortgage, insurance, maintenance and repairs, and property tax payments are sometimes greater than monthly rental costs. Buildings may also gain and lose substantial value due to real estate market fluctuations, and selling a property can take a long time, depending on market conditions. This can make home ownership more constraining if the homeowner intends to move at a future date. Some home owners see their purchase as an investment and intend to sell or to rent the property after renovating or letting the house appreciate in value (known as flipping if done quickly).

Due to the fact that homeowners have a financial stake in their homes, being a homeowner is an economically efficient course of action.
In order to improve their physical and mental well-being as well as their level of life satisfaction, they have a motivation to preserve or raise the value of their properties. Conversely, renters are incentivized to view local issues through a narrow lens, could be unmotivated to participate in civic life, and could see themselves as having little social utility. Compared to renters and absentee landlords, owner-occupiers are sometimes seen as more responsible toward property maintenance and community concerns, since they are more directly affected.

Traditionally, home ownership has been encouraged by governments in Western countries (especially English-speaking countries) because it was thought to help people acquire wealth, to encourage savings, and promote civic engagement. However, the housing market crash of 2008 in most of the English-speaking world has caused academic and policy-makers to question this logic.

==Political influence==
Owning a home influences how an individual views the role of government. Data from OECD countries shows that when housing prices rise, individuals are more critical of the welfare state. Conversely, when housing prices drop, homeowners are more likely to favor government intervention. In the US, areas with high rates of homeownership have higher levels of voter turnout. There is also a weak relationship between homeownership and supporting Republican candidates. Data from the UK supports the idea that homeowners view the value of their home as a kind of private, informal insurance policy against economic shocks. A sufficiently valuable home protects the owner without need for government intervention.

==Costs of home ownership==

===Property tax===
Homeowners are usually required to pay property tax (or millage tax) periodically. The tax is levied by the governing authority of the jurisdiction in which the property is located; it may be paid to a national government, a federated state, a county or geographical region, or a municipality. Multiple jurisdictions may tax the same property.

===Property Transfer Tax===
In most Canadian provinces home purchasers must pay a one-time tax called a Property Transfer Tax (Land Transfer Tax) which is based on the cost of the home.

<text>Imputed rent is the rental price an individual would pay for an asset they own. The concept applies to any capital good, but it is most commonly used in housing markets to measure the rent homeowners would pay for a housing unit equivalent to the one they own. Imputing housing rent is necessary to measure economic activity in national accounts. Because asset owners do not pay rent, owners&#x27; imputed rent must be measured indirectly.

Imputed housing rent is the economic theory of imputation applied to real estate: that the value is more a matter of what the buyer is willing to pay than the cost the seller incurs to create it. In this case, market rents are used to estimate the value to the property owner. Thus, imputed rent offers a way to compare homeowners&#x27; and tenants&#x27; economic decisions.

More formally, in owner-occupancy, the landlord–tenant relationship is short-circuited. Consider a model: two people, A and B, each of whom owns property. If A lives in B&#x27;s property, and B lives in A&#x27;s, two financial transactions take place: each pays rent to the other. But if A and B are both owner-occupiers, no money changes hands even though the same economic relationships exists; there are still two owners and two occupiers, but the transactions between them no longer go through the market. The amount that would have changed hands had the owner and occupier been different persons is the imputed rent. Imputed rents can alternatively be understood as returns to investments in assets. On these grounds, imputed rents might be included in disposable income, e.g. when calculating indices of income distribution.

==Measurement==
There are two common approaches to estimating imputed rents for housing: the &quot;comparison approach&quot; and the &quot;user cost of capital&quot; approach. 

===Comparison approach===
The comparison approach matches rents in tenant-occupied housing units to similar owner-occupied housing units. If the units are identical, the owner-occupant&#x27;s imputed rent is the cost they avoid in renting the other unit. 

In the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses a version of this approach to estimate changes in the price of owner-occupied housing.

===User cost of capital approach===
The user cost approach identifies costs unrecoverable by the owner. These can be defined as:

formula_1

Where is the interest rate, is the property tax rate, is the cost of maintenance, and is depreciation. The rent is the sum of these rates multiplied by the price of the house, . More detailed user cost models consider differential interest costs for housing debt and owner equity and the tax treatment of housing capital income.

==Effects of owner-occupancy==

* Imputed rents disappear from measures of national income and output, unless figures are added to take them into account.
* The government loses the opportunity to tax the transaction. Sometimes, governments have attempted to tax the imputed rent (Schedule A of United Kingdom&#x27;s income tax used to do that), but it tends to be unpopular. Some countries still tax the imputed rent, such as Belgium, Iceland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and Switzerland. The absence of taxes on imputed rents is also referred to as &quot;Home-Ownership Bias&quot;.

In population datasets like the Cross-National Equivalent File, imputed rent is estimated:
* for owner-occupiers, as a small percentage (4–6%) of the capital accrued in the property
* for public housing tenants, as the difference between rent paid and the average rent for a similar property in the same location
* for those living rent-free, as the estimate of the rent they would have to pay to rent a similar property in the same location
* for renters in the private market, as zero

==Extending the principle==

If imputed rent can be applied to housing, it can likewise apply to any good that can be rented, including automobiles and furniture: &quot;In principle, the BEA should also include imputed rent for things like cars, and even furniture, but compared to housing, it’s such a small part of the economy that it’s not worth the effort.&quot;

<text>Housing tenure is a financial arrangement and ownership structure under which someone has the right to live in a house or apartment. The most frequent forms are tenancy, in which rent is paid by the occupant to a landlord, and owner-occupancy, where the occupant owns their own home. Mixed forms of tenure are also possible.

The basic forms of tenure can be subdivided, for example an owner-occupier may own a house outright, or it may be mortgaged. In the case of tenancy, the landlord may be a private individual, a non-profit organization such as a housing association, or a government body, as in public housing.

Surveys used in social science research frequently include questions about housing tenure, because it is a useful proxy for income or wealth, and people are less reluctant to give information about it.

== Types ==
* Owner occupancy – The person or group that occupies a house owns the building (and usually the land on which it sits).
* Tenancy – A landlord who owns an apartment or building rents the right to occupy the unit to a tenant.
* Cooperative – Ownership of the entire building or complex is held in common by a homeowners&#x27; association. Individuals have the &quot;right&quot; to occupy a particular apartment by mutual agreement but do not hold exclusive ownership to it.
* Condominium (a.k.a. commonhold and strata title) – Ownership of an apartment or house is assigned to an individual, but common areas (e.g. hallways, heating system, elevators, exterior areas) are controlled by the homeowners&#x27; association. Fees are charged to the condo owners for maintenance of the common areas. These are referred to as &quot;condo fees&quot;.
* Public housing – Government-owned housing, whether provided for free or leased at a subsidised rate.
* Squatting – Occupation by non-owner without permission by the owner, if any.
* Land trust – Often used as an alternative to ownership for privacy and legal reasons.

== Styles and variations ==
* Timeshare – A modified form of cooperative, condominium, or leased house or apartment, with short-term residency right agreements tailored for vacations.
* Cohousing – A variant of a condominium or cooperative with a high degree of interaction with neighbors in shared areas.

==England==
The Department for Communities and Local Government is responsible for developing government housing policy in England. The English Housing Survey classifies all dwellings into one of four housing tenure classifications:

* Owner-occupied
* Private rented
* Rented from housing association (registered social landlords)
* Rented from local authorities

<doc id="373969" wikidata="Q3043178" url="?curid=373969" title="Santa Claus parade">
<text>Santa Claus parades, also called Christmas parades, are parades held in some countries to celebrate the official opening of the Christmas season with the arrival of Santa Claus who always appears in the last float.
The parades usually include themed floats, dancing or marching groups and bands playing Christmas songs. They are moving pageants that typically end near the centre of a city. Often sponsored by department stores, they may reinforce the store&#x27;s brand recognition during the important Christmas shopping season.

==History==

The Christmas parade is a direct descendant of late Medieval and Renaissance revivals of Roman Triumphs, which had music and banners, wagons filled with the spoils of war, and climaxed with the &quot;dux&quot; riding in a chariot, preferably drawn by two horses, and thus called the biga. (A quadriga such as surmounts the Brandenburg Gate is drawn by four horses.) Similarly, the climax of a Santa Claus parade is always Santa in his sleigh, drawn by eight reindeer (an &quot;octigia&quot;). Roman Triumphs were themselves consciously modeled on ceremonies honoring the gods. The Santa Claus parade directly corresponds to the modern &quot;triumphal entry&quot; of Santa Claus.

==Notable parades==
Santa Claus parades are most common in North America.

One of the largest is the Toronto Santa Claus Parade, held annually in mid-November in Toronto, started in 1905 by the Eaton&#x27;s department store. That year Santa arrived on a train and met Mr. and Mrs. Timothy Eaton, then walked to the Eaton&#x27;s Downtown store. The first float was introduced in 1908 and consisted of one truck with a band to accompany Santa. The parade now has over 24 floats, 24 bands, and 1,700 participants, and is broadcast in several countries.

Peoria, Illinois has the longest running Santa Claus Parade in the U.S. The parade celebrated its 131st edition on November 23, 2018. The first parade in 1887 consisted of boats and derricks sailing down the river as part of the new bridge construction. In 1888, Peoria held a parade through town, celebrating the completion of the new Upper Free Bridge. The following December, Frederick Block of the Schipper and Block Department Store (later Block &amp; Kuhl&#x27;s) sponsored a parade that followed the same route and featured Santa Claus. This created the concept of a department-store parade that was later emulated in larger cities. Various attractions in the parade through the years included fireworks, circus wagons, a calliope, live reindeer and numerous parade floats. The parade was first televised in 1958.

In Vancouver, the Santa Claus Parade, originally sponsored by Rogers, and later Telus, has also grown to be one of the largest, with 65 floats and bands. A special train also circulates through the parade, collecting donations for the Greater Vancouver Food Bank and the Lower Mainland Christmas Bureau. In 2005, the parade collected over of food and 2,300 toy donations. The last parade occurred in 2019, with the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by lack of sponsorship, leading to its cancellation.

Houston, Texas hosts the H-E-B Thanksgiving Day Parade annually since 1950. The previous sponsor was Foley&#x27;s, until Macy&#x27;s bought it.

Gimbels Department Store in Philadelphia started its parade in 1920. The parade is now known as the 6abc Dunkin&#x27; Donuts Thanksgiving Day Parade and was formerly sponsored by IKEA and Boscov&#x27;s. It is the oldest parade in the United States held on Thanksgiving Day as the older parade in Peoria is held the day after.

In New York City, the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, famous for its giant helium-filled balloons, began in 1924, inspired by the Eaton&#x27;s parade in Toronto, with Macy&#x27;s employees in costume, and— a distinctively Roman touch— animals borrowed from the Central Park Zoo. The giant balloons made an early appearance, with Felix the Cat in 1927. The inflation of the balloons in the streets flanking the American Museum of Natural History the night before has become a traditional gathering for New York&#x27;s Upper West Side.

Also in 1924, the J. L. Hudson Company staged its first Thanksgiving Parade in Detroit, Michigan. Among the early features were large papier-mâché heads similar to those seen by Hudson&#x27;s display director, Charles Wendel, on a recent trip to Viareggio, Italy. The heads continue to be a feature in the annual event. Hudson&#x27;s sponsored the parade until 1979 when it was turned over to a non-profit group. In 1983, it became the &quot;Michigan Thanksgiving Parade&quot; and is currently known as &quot;America&#x27;s Thanksgiving Parade&quot;.

Grand Rapids, Michigan&#x27;s annual Santa Claus parade, known today as the Art Van Santa Parade, made history in 1971 when it became the first parade to end with the arrival of an African-American Santa Claus.

The Hollywood Christmas Parade (formerly The Santa Claus Lane Parade) in Southern California is a seasonal tradition that somewhat competes with the Tournament of Roses Parade and the Doo Dah Parade. Gene Autry wrote the well known Christmas song &quot;Here Comes Santa Claus&quot; after hearing children on the Santa Claus Lane Parade route yelling &quot;Here Comes Santa Claus!&quot; upon glimpsing Santa in the distance.

As part of its citywide Christmas celebrations, known as Gran Festival Navideño, Mexico City holds a parade on Eje Central. The 2011 version featured mobile machines that blew artificial snow on participants and spectators. This parade has been telecast on the Televisa and Azteca networks, with Televisa&#x27;s coverage being the official coverage and being the most-widely aired coverage, being broadcast in other Spanish-speaking countries and on Galavision in the United States.

Elsewhere, especially in Commonwealth countries outside Canada, Santa Claus parades are sometimes known as Christmas pageants. The largest is the Adelaide Christmas Pageant, which was begun in 1933 and is held annually in November. In New Zealand most main centres have a Santa Parade, with many held since the early 20th century. Early New Zealand parades often had Santa arrive by unusual means, including on an elephant, by plane, and by parachute.

<text>Ergine is an ergoline alkaloid that occurs in Clavicipitaceous fungi. It is also called lysergic acid amide. Ergine is structurally and effectually similar to LSD and has a history of use in Mesoamerica; many Westerners have also tried it. Convolvulaceae vines (Morning Glory) have a permanent bond with some of these fungi. The most common source of ergine for consumers is the seeds of Ipomoea tricolor, Ipomoea corymbosa, and Argyreia nervosa; isoergine and lysergic acid propanolamide have also been shown to contribute to their psychoactivity.

==Occurrence in nature==
Ergine is not a biosynthetic endpoint itself, but rather a hydrolysis product of lysergic acid hydroxyethylamide (LAH), lysergic acid hydroxymethylethylamide (ergonovine), and ergopeptines or their ergopeptam precursors. 

Lysergic acid hydroxyethylamide is very vulnerable to this hydrolysis, and many analyses of ergoline-containing fungi show little to no LAH and substantial amounts of ergine. 

An ergine analog, 8-hydroxyergine, has also been found in natural products in two studies. Methylergonovine and methylmethylergonovine (methysergide) have also been found in a natural product in one study; these are documented as semisynthetic chemicals, so the findings need to be repeated for certainty. The aforementioned chemicals are the only natural ergoamides. 

LAH &amp; ergine are predominant in &quot;Claviceps paspali&quot;, but are only found in trace amounts in the more well-known &quot;Claviceps purpurea&quot; (both are ergot-spreading fungi). The major products of &quot;C. purpurea&quot; are ergopeptines, but &quot;C. paspali&quot; does not generate ergopeptines. Ergonovine is the only ergoamide in &quot;C. purpurea&quot; in a substantial amount. 

LAH &amp; ergine are also found in the related fungi, &quot;Periglandula&quot;, which are permanently connected with &quot;Ipomoea tricolor&quot;, &quot;Ipomoea corymbosa&quot;, &quot;Argyreia nervosa&quot; (&quot;morning glory&quot;, coaxihuitl, Hawaiian baby woodrose), and an estimated over 440 other Convolvulaceae (ergolines have been identified in 42 of these plants and not all of them contain ergine). Ergonovine is present in Ipomoea tricolor in one-tenth to one-third of the amount of ergine. This variable may account for the varying reports about the psychedelic effect of these seeds.

Other fungi that have been found to contain LAH and/or ergine:

* Unidentified &quot;Acremonium&quot; species that infects sleepy grass (&quot;C. purpurea&quot; also infects sleepy grass). 

* Unidentified &quot;Acremonium&quot; species that infects drunken horse grass 
* &quot;Acremonium coenophialum&quot; (infects &quot;Festuca arundinacea&quot;) 
* &quot;Epichloë gansuensis&quot; var. &quot;inebriens&quot; (infects drunken horse grass) 
* &quot;Metarhizium brunneum&quot; 
* &quot;Metarhizium acridum&quot; 
* &quot;Metarhizium anisopliae&quot; 
* &quot;Metarhizium flavoviride&quot;

==Psychedelic effects==
Ergine has only been given a minuscule amount of attention. Albert Hofmann and his colleagues self-administered ergine, and it was adminstered in two clinical trials. Synthetic ergine was used in all cases. Albert Hofmann stated that ergine induces a &quot;psychotomimetic&quot; effect with &quot;a marked narcotic component&quot;: &quot;Tired, dreamy, incapable of clear thoughts. Very sensitive to noises which give an unpleasant sensation.&quot; There are parallels between Hofmann&#x27;s comments and the ones in the two trials:

Heim 1968 also noted &quot;paraesthesia&quot;, &quot;synesthesia&quot; and an &quot;overestimation of the time that had passed&quot; (isoergine), but also concluded, &quot;our experiments with ᴅ-lysergic acid amide also confirm the results that Sᴏʟᴍꜱ had made with this substance, namely a predominantly sedative intoxication.&quot; Hofmann emphasized this sedative effect:

&quot;Furthermore there is not only a quantitative difference between the principles of &quot;Ipomoea&quot; [&quot;tricolor&quot;] and &quot;Turbina corymbosa&quot; and LSD; there is likewise a qualitative one, LSD being a very specific hallucinogen, whereas the psychic effects of lysergic acid amide and the total alkaloids of these two plants are characterized by a pronounced narcotic component (Hofmann, 1968).&quot;

&quot;A substance very closely related to LSD, the monoethylamide of lysergic acid (LAE-32), in which an &quot;ethyl&quot; group is replaced by a hydrogen atom on the diethylamide residue of LSD, proved to be some &quot;ten times less&quot; psychoactive than LSD. The hallucinogenic effect is also qualitatively different: it is characterized by a narcotic component. This narcotic effect is yet more pronounced in lysergic acid amide (LA-111), in which &quot;both&quot; ethyl groups of LSD are displaced by hydrogen atoms. These effects, which I established in comparative self-experiments with LA-111 and LAE-32, were corroborated by subsequent clinical investigations.&quot;

&quot;The experience had some strong narcotic effect, but at the same time there was a very strange sense of voidness. In this [void], everything loses its meaning. It is a very mystical experience.&quot;

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Ergine interacts with serotonin, dopamine, and adrenergic receptors similarly to but with lower affinity than lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). The psychedelic effects of ergine can be attributed to activation of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors.

==Chemistry==
===History===
Ergine was first obtained by Sidney Smith and Geoffrey Willward Timmis in 1932.

Albert Hofmann was first to identify ergine as a natural constituent of Turbina corymbosa seeds. 
===Biosynthesis===
The biosynthetic pathway to ergine starts like most other ergoline alkaloid- with the formation of the ergoline scaffold. This synthesis starts with the prenylation of L-tryptophan in an SN1 fashion with dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) as the prenyl donor and catalyzed by prenyltransferase 4-dimethylallyltryptophan synthase (DMATS), to form 4-L-dimethylallyltryptophan (4-L-DMAT). The DMAPP is derived from mevalonic acid. A three strep mechanism is proposed to form 4-L-DMAT: the formation of an allylic carbocation, a nucleophilic attack of the indole nucleus to the cation, followed by deprotonation to restore aromaticity and to generate 4-L-DMAT. 4-Dimethylallyltyptophan &quot;N&quot;-methyltransferase (EasF) catalyzes the &quot;N&quot;-methylation of 4-L-DMAT at the amino of the tryptophan backbone, using S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) as the methyl source, to form 4-dimethylallyl-L-abrine (4-DMA-L-abrine). The conversion of 4-DMA-L-abrine to chanoclavine-I is thought to occur through a decarboxylation and two oxidation steps, catalyzed by the FAD dependent oxidoreductase, EasE, and the catalase, EasC. The chanoclavine intermediate is then oxidized to chanoclavine-l-aldehyde, catalyzed by the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR), EasD.

From here, the biosynthesis diverges and the products formed are plant and fungus-specific. The biosynthesis of ergine in C&quot;laviceps purpurea&quot; will be exemplified, in which agroclavine is produced following the formation of chanoclavine-l-aldehyde, catalyzed by EasA through a keto-enol tautomerization to facilitate rotation about the C-C bond, followed by tautomerization back to the aldehyde and condensation with the proximal secondary amine to form an iminium species, which is subsequently reduced to the tertiary amine and yielding argoclavine. Cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP450) are then thought to catalyze the formation of elymoclavine from argoclavine via a 2 electron oxidation. This is further converted to paspalic acid via a 4 electron oxidation, catalyzed by &quot;cloA&quot;, a CYP450 monooxygenase. Paspalic acid then undergoes isomerization of the C-C double bond in conjugation with the acid to form D-lysergic acid. While the specifics of the formation of ergine from D-lysergic acid are not known, it is proposed to occur through a nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) with two enzymes primarily involve: D-lysergyl peptide synthase (LPS) 1 and 2.
==Use of Morning Glory seeds as a drug==
===History===
Albert Hofmann describes ergine as &quot;the main constituent of &quot;ololiuhqui&quot;&quot;. &quot;Ololiuhqui&quot; was used by South American healers in shamanic healing ceremonies. Similarly, ingestion of morning glory seeds by Mazatec tribes to &quot;commune with their gods&quot; was reported by Richard Schultes in 1941 and is still practiced today.

According to the ethnobotanist R. Gordon Wasson, Thomas MacDougall and Francisco Ortega (&quot;Chico&quot;), a Zapotec guide and trader, should be credited for the discovery of the ceremonial use of &quot;Ipomoea tricolor&quot; seeds in Zapotec towns and villages in the uplands of southern Oaxaca. The seeds of both &quot;Ipomoea tricolor&quot; and &quot;Rivea corymbosa&quot;, another species which has a similar chemical profile, are used in some Zapotec towns.

The Central Intelligence Agency conducted research on the psychedelic properties of &quot;Rivea corymbosa&quot; seeds for MKULTRA.

===Physiological effects===
While its physiological effects vary from person to person, the following symptoms have been attributed to the consumption of ergine or ergine containing seeds:

* Sedation
* Visual and auditory hallucinations
* Euphoria
* Loss of motor control
* Nausea
* Vasoconstriction
* Delusion
* Anxiety
* Paranoia
* Irregular heartbeat

One study found that 2 of 4 human subjects experienced cardiovascular dysregulation and the study had to be halted, concluding that the ingestion of seeds containing ergine was less safe than commonly believed. Importantly this may have been a product of other substances within the seeds. The same study also observed that reactions were highly differing in type and intensity between different subjects.

Like other psychedelics, ergine is not considered to be addictive. Additionally, there are no known deaths directly associated with pharmacological effects of ergine consumption. All associated deaths are due to indirect causes, such as self-harm, impaired judgement, and adverse drug interactions. One known case involved a suicide that was reported in 1964 after ingestion of morning glory seeds. Another instance is a death due to falling off of a building after ingestion of Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds and alcohol. A study gave mice 3000 mg/kg with no lethal effects.

===Adverse effects===
A 2016 study showed that penniclavine was the predomiant alkaloid in &quot;Ipomoea tricolor&quot; seeds. Ergoclavines are known to cause convulsive ergotism, the milder form of ergotism. Gangrenous ergotism is caused by ergopeptines: the complex peptide moiety forces persistance at the receptor sites. Ergopeptines are rare in Convolvulaceae, being found in 10 species, not including the three that are commonly ingested, although Paulke 2014 says analytical evidence suggests that &quot;A. nervosa&quot; contains ergopeptines. Many people desire purified seed extracts, but the efficacy of this is questionable, as even pure ergine and ergonovine have shown toxic effects.

Ergine:

&quot;The expression and behavior of the test subjects changed just 45 minutes after taking the substance: the test subjects appeared to be suffering, their facial expressions were deteriorating as if they had suffered a serious illness, and their movements were noticeably slower.&quot;

&quot;In the self-reports of both test subjects, complaints about vegetative symptoms predominated: unpleasant, flu-like feeling of illness, nausea, sudden onset of nausea, with vomiting that could be stopped with 2 cm3 of Cyclicinum hydrochloricum. In addition, sensations of heat, sweating, dizziness, a feeling of heaviness and general tiredness were observed.&quot;

Heim 1968
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Ergonovine:

&quot;Walking in this dreamy state was difficult due to leg cramps and slight incoordination. There was always a great desire to lie supine.&quot;

&quot;One of us (J.B.) felt the cramping in the legs as painful and debilitating.&quot;

&quot;We all had a slight hangover the following morning.&quot;

&quot;The mild entheogenic effects of ergonovine are similar to those of LSD. However, in dramatic contrast to LSD, the somatic effects of ergonovine greatly overshadow its psychic effects, so much so that we had no wish to ingest more than 10.0 mg,&quot;

Bigwood 1979

===Chemical coatings on seeds===

Garden seeds, in general, may be coated with fungicides et. al. (e.g. neonicotinoids, Thiram, and ApronMaxx). It is rumored that this is the cause of the severe adverse effects that have been observed, but the seeds, themselves, contain toxins, specifically glycoresins and ergoclavines. Some people even believe that an emetic chemical is purposely added to the seeds to prevent people from ingesting them, but that has never been proven. One 1964 article states that reported adverse effects must come from the seeds, as the stated insecticide is too &quot;inocuous&quot; to humans to be responsible. 

A related rumor is that the seeds contain cyanogenic glycosides. The UseNet post on which this is based contains two references, but neither of them support that claim, and Eckart Eich says that they probably don&#x27;t occur in many Convolvulaceae. There is a similar claim in a publication from 1973, warning about &quot;a strychnine-like alkaloid&quot;, but that is probably just a misapplication of the claim that peyote contains strychnine, which, itself, is a rumor.

==Legal status==
The legality of consuming, cultivating, and possessing ergine varies depending on the country.

There are no laws against possession of ergine-containing seeds in the United States. However, possession of the pure compound without a prescription or a DEA license would be prosecuted, as ergine, under the name &quot;lysergic acid amide&quot;, is listed under Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. Similarly, ergine is considered a Class A substance in the United Kingdom, categorized as a precursor to LSD.

In most Australian states, the consumption of ergine containing materials is prohibited under state legislation.

In Canada, ergine is not illegal to possess as it is not listed under Canada&#x27;s Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, though it is likely illegal to sell for human consumption.

In New Zealand, ergine is a controlled drug, however the plants and seeds of the morning glory species are legal to possess, cultivate, buy, and distribute.

<text>Apocalypse (En Sabah Nur) is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is one of the world&#x27;s first mutants, and was a principal villain for the original X-Factor team and later the X-Men and related spin-off teams. Created by writer Louise Simonson and artist Jackson Guice, Apocalypse first appeared in &quot;X-Factor&quot; #5 (June 1986). Apocalypse is one of the most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe where he is the father of the original incarnation of the Horsemen of Apocalypse.

Since his introduction, the character has appeared in a number of &quot;X-Men&quot; titles, including spin-offs and several limited series. Apocalypse has also been featured in various forms of media. Oscar Isaac portrayed the character in &quot;X-Men: Apocalypse&quot;.

==Conception and creation==
While writing the first five issues of &quot;X-Factor&quot;, Bob Layton dropped hints of a villain operating behind the scenes and leading the Alliance of Evil (mentioned in &quot;X-Factor&quot; #4, May 1986). Layton intended to reveal this character to be the Daredevil villain the Owl on the final page of &quot;X-Factor&quot; #5. However, Layton left the book after writing this issue and was replaced by writer Louise Simonson. Editor Bob Harras said that the character arose because of storytelling needs: &quot;All I had communicated to Louise was my desire that an A-level, first class character be introduced. I wanted a Magneto-level villain who would up the stakes and give the X-Factor team reason to exist.&quot;

In a 2011 interview with &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, Simonson explained that when the &quot;X-Factor&quot; series was created, the original five X-Men were pulled out of the purview of Chris Claremont, who was writing &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot;. However, Simonson felt that the series needed an archenemy, or what Simonson called &quot;a big, bad villain&quot;, and conceived of Apocalypse. Simonson described the character thus:

Harras also commented, &quot;As soon as I saw the sketch by Walter [Simonson] and heard Louise&#x27;s take on him, I knew we had the character I wanted. Jackson [Guice] redrew the page, patching in the shadowy Apocalypse where the Owl had been. But the genesis was clearly Walt and Weezie&#x27;s.&quot; Guice admitted to difficulty recalling the details behind redrawing the last page of issue #5: &quot;The best I can remember now is putting his look together pretty much right on the pencil page—just adding bits of costuming business which hinted toward his true appearance when we&#x27;d eventually see him in full reveal. I don&#x27;t believe there was even a character sketch done for him at that point—I planned on making sense of it all later on, but by then I was gone and others had that concern.&quot; Apocalypse&#x27;s silhouette in issue #5 does not match up with his full appearance in issue #6, suggesting the possibility that Guice was using Simonson&#x27;s sketch as a reference for issue #6 but did not have access to it earlier, necessitating that he come up with his own design for issue #5. Walter Simonson himself has downplayed his role in the character&#x27;s creation, saying that Guice was responsible for creating the design and that he, Simonson, merely modified it later: &quot;I did not co-create Apocalypse. However, I wish I had. Louise Simonson and Jackson Guice created him. He appeared in a few panels at the end of one of Jackson’s last X-FACTORs, so I am the first artist to use him extensively in stories. And I kind of juiced up his physique a bit.&quot;

Bob Harras said on the character of Apocalypse:

Although the character first appeared in 1986, he was retroactively said to have been present during previously published stories. The unnamed benefactor of the Living Monolith in &quot;Marvel Graphic Novel&quot; #17 (1985) was later identified as Apocalypse in disguise. &quot;Classic X-Men&quot; #25 revealed that years earlier, Apocalypse encountered the terrorist Moses Magnum and granted him superhuman power.

During his run on &quot;Cable&quot;, Robert Weinberg planned a story to reveal that Apocalypse was the third Summers brother, a mysterious sibling to the mutants Cyclops and Havok. But Weinberg left the book before he could go along with his plan and the third Summers brother was revealed to be the mutant Gabriel Summers, a.k.a. Vulcan.

Apocalypse was the principal adversary in the mid-1980s &quot;X-Men&quot; spin-off series &quot;X-Factor&quot; (1986–91) until being apparently killed at the climax of issue #68 (July 1991). Since then, the character has died and been resurrected several times thanks to his power and advanced alien technology. His name En Sabah Nur was revealed in &quot;Cable&quot; #2 (June 1993) and his birthplace (Egypt) and the origin of his technology, were revealed in &quot;X-Force&quot; #37 (August 1994). According to Marvel, the name translates from Arabic as &quot;The First One&quot; (although, in reality, the translation is considered grammatically incorrect, as it means &quot;The First/Morning Light&quot; [En-(&quot;The&quot;) + Sabah- (&quot;Morning&quot;) + Nur- (&quot;Light&quot;)] ). It is later revealed in the origin story &quot;Rise of Apocalypse&quot; that he is possibly the first mutant (meaning, in this case, a human being born with the X-gene), born 5,000 years ago. The character gained greater popularity in 1995 when the storyline &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; featured an alternate timeline in which Apocalypse has conquered much of planet Earth.
The character was reincarnated in the pages of &quot;Uncanny X-Force&quot; #1 as a small boy with no memory of his previous incarnation. The boy was named Evan Sabahnur. In 2012 the adult, villainous version of Apocalypse returned in the series &quot;Uncanny Avengers&quot;. His origins are further explored in the storyline &quot;Apocalypse Wars&quot;.

In 2019, writers Jonathan Hickman and Tini Howard expanded upon Apocalypse&#x27;s origin and agenda in the Excalibur series and the X of Swords event. Apocalypse&#x27;s &#x27;survival of the fittest&#x27; mentality was revealed to have had the aim of preparing the mutant population for a dangerous reunion with the long-lost mutants of Arakko, which included his wife and four children, the original Horsemen of Apocalypse.

==Fictional character biography==
===&quot;Rise of Apocalypse&quot;===

The being who would later be called Apocalypse is born with the mutant X-gene thousands of years ago in Aqaba. Because of his grey skin and blue lips, his people abandon him as an infant. He is rescued by Baal of the Sandstormers who sees the child&#x27;s potential power and will to survive. Baal names him En Sabah Nur, which Marvel translates as &quot;The First One&quot;. The Sandstormers live by the credo of survival of the fittest, believing that only those who are strong enough to survive hardship and direct conflict are worthy of life. It is also revealed during the Apocalypse Wars that, as a young boy, En Sabah Nur is very generous and selfless, to the chagrin of Baal. A time-displaced Evan Sabah Nur and All-New X-Men Beast try to save En Sabah Nur, but he allows himself to be captured to help them escape.

Around this time, the time-traveller Kang the Conqueror arrives in Egypt and assumes the identity of Pharaoh Rama-Tut. Knowing who En Sabah Nur is fated to become and where he is, Rama-Tut sends his General Ozymandias and an army to destroy the Sandstormers and find the young Apocalypse. En Sabah Nur and Baal are injured and seek refuge in a cave. Before he dies, Baal reveals advanced alien technology hidden in the cave, left behind by the deity-like aliens known as Celestials. Vowing revenge on Rama-Tut, En Sabah Nur enters the Pharaoh&#x27;s city posing as a slave and draws the romantic attention of Ozymandias&#x27;s sister, Nephri. On seeing the mutant&#x27;s true appearance, Nephri rejects him and turns to her brother for protection. The heartbroken En Sabah Nur&#x27;s rage causes his mutant abilities to fully emerge. Rampaging, he renames himself Apocalypse. Rama-Tut flees and En Sabah Nur uses the Celestial technology to transform his former tormentor Ozymandias into a blind clairvoyant made of living stone, now enslaved to Apocalypse. As the years pass, Apocalypse finds he no longer aged. Around this time he founded the Coven Akkaba, an order of human sorcerers, in order to explore the field of magic. The human mages believed that their magic would make them equal to mutants in Apocalypse&#x27;s eyes. They were wrong and when they realized their patron considered them disposable as non-mutants, however, Akkaba broke from Apocalypse and nursed a centuries-long grudge.

It is revealed in the series &quot;S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot; that Apocalypse, at some point in the days of ancient Egypt, joined forces with the Brotherhood of the Shield to successfully fend off a Brood invasion. Also present were Imhotep and a man who was either the moon god called Khonshu or his first Moon Knight avatar/champion.

===Early history===
As the millennia pass, Apocalypse travels around planet Earth, convincing civilizations that he is a deity (inspiring different myths as a result) and manipulating them into fighting wars. He justifies that this encourages &quot;growth, judgment, and destruction&quot;. Apocalypse&#x27;s progeny become Clan Akkaba. Apocalypse encounters the near-immortal human offshoot race known as Eternals, primarily the members Ikaris and Sersi, who refer to him as their &quot;Ancient Nemesis&quot;. At different points, Apocalypse uses his Celestial technology to enter periods of suspended animation, leaving Akkaba and Ozymandias to act in his stead.

In AD 1013, Apocalypse seeks to destroy the Asgardian Thor, who he knows will cause him trouble in the future, according to information obtained from Rama-Tut, yet the plans are foiled by Odin. In the 12th century, Apocalypse encounters the Eternal Sersi again while awakening latent mutant powers in a crusader named Bennet du Paris, also known as Exodus. In 1459, Apocalypse defeats Vlad Tepes (Vlad the Impaler) in Romania, who later becomes the vampire more popularly known as Count Dracula.

In 1859, Apocalypse encounters British scientist Nathaniel Essex and learns more about the nature of mutants. Apocalypse uses his Celestial technology to transform Essex into the superhuman being Mister Sinister. He then coerces Sinister and the Hellfire Club into aiding his plans for global conquest, but Sinister concludes that these plans are madness and betrays Apocalypse, forcing him back into hibernation.

In 1897, Count Dracula attacks the Clan Akkaba in revenge for his defeat at Apocalypse&#x27;s hands, forcing the Clan to revive their master from suspended animation. Apocalypse defeats the vampire again, this time with help from Abraham Van Helsing. Eventually, Apocalypse enters hibernation again, expecting to remain so for possibly two centuries, by which point mutants should be more common on Earth.

===Modern era===
After many years of suspended animation, Apocalypse awakens nearly a century earlier than planned due to the arrival of the time-traveling mutant Cable (ironically, Cable had traveled to this point in time hoping to prevent the ancient mutant from awakening). Apocalypse decides the Earth is ready for further examination and testing. He grants superhuman powers to the terrorist known as Moses Magnum, who then tests the X-Men and the Avengers. Apocalypse later briefly employs the Alliance of Evil to capture the mutant Michael Nowlan, who can boost the power of other mutants. This plan brings Apocalypse into direct conflict with the first incarnation of X-Factor, when the team comprised the original X-Men.

Apocalypse then recruits mutants to serve as his personal guard, known as the Four Horsemen. Among them is Angel, AKA Warren Worthington III, whom Apocalypse has corrupted and turned into a cyborg called Death. Warren Worthington regains his identity and helps his friends defeat Apocalypse, adopting the new codename Archangel. Apocalypse escapes with his new recruit, the Morlock called Caliban, while X-Factor then takes his Celestial spaceship as a base.

During &quot;The Evolutionary War&quot;, the High Evolutionary plans to rid the Earth of those he feels are preventing evolution. Believing this disrupts the natural order and his own plans, Apocalypse battles the High Evolutionary.

Following the genetic manipulation of Caliban, Apocalypse declines an alliance with the Asgardian villain Loki and other villains conspiring to unleash the &quot;Acts of Vengeance&quot;. This results in a brief fight between Apocalypse and Loki.

===Sins of the Futures===
Apocalypse learns of Sinister&#x27;s intention to create an adversary powerful enough to destroy him: Nathan Christopher Charles Summers, the son of Scott Summers and Madelyne Pryor. Apocalypse, viewing him as a threat and realizing that Nathan&#x27;s energy is the very energy that awoke him all those months earlier, sends his newly formed group, the Riders of the Storm, to abduct the Summers child. Apocalypse at this time had conquered the city of Attilan, home of the Inhumans, as well as enslaved part of its population. X-Factor, alongside the Inhuman Royal Family, attacks Apocalypse&#x27;s lunar stronghold. Although Apocalypse is severely defeated, the young Nathan is infected with a techno-organic virus and is sent to the future with a woman named Askani to be cured.

In the future, Apocalypse has conquered the Earth and ruled until the 39th century. By this time, Apocalypse&#x27;s body had grown feeble: he becomes aware of the young Nathan&#x27;s presence in this time, but only succeeds in kidnapping a clone of the child which Askani created. Apocalypse plans to transfer his consciousness and power into the clone&#x27;s stronger body, but perishes in combat with the (real) teenage Nathan. Nathan grows up to become the warrior Cable (while his clone grows up to become the mutant terrorist Stryfe) and travels back to the past to prevent Apocalypse&#x27;s future domination of the planet.

In the present, Apocalypse is prematurely awoken from his regeneration chamber by his Riders (now calling themselves the Dark Riders), who inform their master that his Horsemen have kidnapped Cyclops and Jean Grey, supposedly under his instructions (in actuality, Mister Sinister, who was posing as Apocalypse). When attempting to rejuvenate himself again, Apocalypse is nearly killed by Stryfe who had arrived in the past to take revenge on Apocalypse. After a battle on the Moon with his former servants, the Dark Riders (who had joined Stryfe), Apocalypse is left for dead by Archangel.

The Dark Riders&#x27; new leader, Genesis (the adopted son of Cable, who had traveled to the present to ensure Apocalypse&#x27;s rise and exact revenge on his father), plans to resurrect Apocalypse by sacrificing the lives of the people in villages neighboring Akkaba. During this time, Wolverine is held captive by Genesis, who attempts to restore Wolverine&#x27;s lost adamantium skeleton and turn him into a Horseman as a gift for Apocalypse. Wolverine breaks free and kills Genesis along with nearly all of the Dark Riders. Genesis had built a sarcophagus with Apocalypse&#x27;s likeness, which is empty since Apocalypse had already revived.

===Further schemes===
After a long healing slumber, Apocalypse, fully restored, awakens with Ozymandias at his side and quickly learns of the present danger: Onslaught. He observes the conflict between the psionic entity and Earth&#x27;s heroes with Uatu the Watcher, who suggests to Apocalypse a course of action: an alliance with the one who hated him the most, Cable. Apocalypse surmises that Onslaught will be most vulnerable through the astral plane and that he needs Cable for actual physical transportation to this realm. Once on the astral plane, Apocalypse removes the captive Franklin Richards, greatly weakening Onslaught. The plan succeeds, but is interrupted by the Invisible Woman, who had invisibly accompanied the pair, having suspected Apocalypse&#x27;s motive in wanting to actually kill her son. However, the reprieve in battle gave Onslaught the time to escape, prolonging the conflict.

Following the events of the &quot;Onslaught&quot; saga, the gamma-spawned powerhouse, the Hulk and his human alter ego, Bruce Banner, are split into two separate entities: Hulk now draws upon energy derived from Franklin Richards&#x27; pocket universe. Apocalypse recruits the Hulk to become his Horseman, War, with intentions of using the Hulk&#x27;s nexus-energy to overcome the Celestials. To test this newest recruit, Apocalypse set War against the New World Order, a shadow cabinet organization that intends to conquer the planet. The New World Order in turn set the Juggernaut and the Absorbing Man against War, but both are easily defeated. Hulk comes to his senses after injuring his friend, Rick Jones. Despite this apparent setback, the incident was still a victory for Apocalypse as it was a successful testing of newly understood Celestial technology. Apocalypse activates the self-destruct mechanism on the sword of War, which the New World Order had obtained, destroying their headquarters.

The Hellfire Club later awakens Apocalypse&#x27;s long-hidden Harbinger from its deep sleep: originally a normal man, whom Apocalypse in the 19th century once left to incubate for 100 years. Apocalypse releases his Horseman (Caliban) and his scribe Ozymandias from his possession, to fend for themselves, if they were to survive the coming events. Cable with the Avengers battles the Harbinger, but are unable to stop it. Apocalypse then appears, activating a bomb inside the Harbinger intended to destroy all of New York, but Cable manages to prevent this disaster.

When Magneto is disrupting Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, Apocalypse sends a Skrull impersonating the mutant Astra (having dealt with the original Astra) to stop the Master of Magnetism.

Intending to start an all-out war between the humans and the subterranean-dwelling Deviants as part of his plan to test the strong, Apocalypse sets off nuclear warheads at Lemuria, causing the Deviants to further mutate. Apocalypse launches an attack at San Francisco, using a mentally controlled Deviant, Karkas, now a gigantic monster, that the Eternals are forced to battle. Apocalypse is confronted by his centuries-old foe, Ikaris, who now is a Prime Eternal. Although Apocalypse defeats Ikaris, the Eternal still succeeds in destroying his ship and thwarting his plan.

===The Twelve===

Supposedly lost diaries of the mutant seer Destiny surfaced, telling of twelve beings that could defeat Apocalypse once and for all. Various mutants, all listed in the prophecy, are abducted by Apocalypse&#x27;s Horsemen including a faction of the Skrulls. The Twelve legend was in fact a ruse, orchestrated by Apocalypse himself: once the Twelve are assembled, Apocalypse intended to use them to transform himself into a deity-like entity beyond the Celestials. It is revealed at the end of this story arc that Apocalypse&#x27;s physical form has been burned out due to the vast amount of energies he has under his control, forcing him to wear a bio-armor (like his future counterpart) and now plans to use Nate Grey as a host body for him to move his energy and consciousness into. The X-Men confront Apocalypse as he is close to merging with Nate, but are unable to stop him. Cyclops pushes Nate Grey out of the way, merging with Apocalypse instead. While the merge is successful, Apocalypse&#x27;s aim for unlimited power is not and he attempts to complete the transformation by warping reality into various scenarios. Apocalypse hoped to lure the Twelve into empowering him with their energy, but eventually, the mutants realize their true predicament and Apocalypse teleports away.

An amnesiac and powerless cyborg Cyclops regains control of the merged form, but Apocalypse begins to re-emerge. Jean and Cable are alerted to his location in Egypt, where Jean in the end manages to free Cyclops by telepathically tearing out Apocalypse&#x27;s essence from her husband&#x27;s body, rendering Apocalypse in an incorporeal astral form, which Cable apparently destroys using his .

===2000s===
In the aftermath of the 2005 &quot;Decimation&quot; storyline, in which most of the mutants lost their powers, Apocalypse was revealed to be alive and well. The techno-organic virus, with which he long ago infected Cable, was revealed to be the means by which Apocalypse&#x27;s spirit reconstituted itself. With only a drop of his blood into a vat of organs and blood, the virus rewrote the genetic code of the material within to form a body for Apocalypse. Apocalypse awakes from a slumber in a tomb in Akkaba, recalling:

Across the world—helpless mutants slaughtered. Pogroms. Horror. ...Something has woken me from my slumber. Once, a sudden surge in worldwide mutant power stirred me from a similar sleep. Now—a plummet in global mutant capacity—has opened my eyes.

Apocalypse finds himself on a planet with its mutant population reduced to a fraction of what it had been, only a few hundred remaining out of the millions who populated earth prior to his demise at Cable&#x27;s hands. Reappearing inside a Sphinx-shaped ship, Apocalypse confronts the X-Men with his newly assembled cadre of Horsemen on the front lawn of the X-Mansion. The Horseman Famine uses his powers to cause an intense feeling of hunger and weakness in the mutants and humans on the institute grounds. Apocalypse offers the mutants an elixir: his own blood, provided they join his side. Bent on becoming the new messiah for mutant-kind, Apocalypse approaches the Earth leaders at the United Nations in New York and issues an ultimatum: humanity would destroy ninety percent of its own population, putting man and mutant on level ground in anticipation of the final conflict when the worthy alone would survive – or Apocalypse would unleash his meta-plague on the planet and obliterate all humanity.

In the end, Apocalypse&#x27;s horsemen are lost, Ozymandias betrays him, and he is forced to retreat by a combined assault of the X-Men and the Avengers. Ultimately, it is discovered that the Celestials &quot;lent&quot; their technology to Apocalypse, requiring as payment &quot;greater sufferings later&quot;. He attempts to embrace death as an escape from his lifelong pact, only to find himself instantly resurrected and hearing a voice: &quot;We cannot let you die. Not yet. It is time Apocalypse… it is time&quot;.

During the &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline, Quasimodo researched Apocalypse for Norman Osborn and states that he would be unsuitable for Osborn to use in any long-term plans.

===2010s===
Apocalypse&#x27;s followers, the Clan Akkaba, manage to bring about Apocalypse&#x27;s return, albeit in the form of a child they will indoctrinate. Upon learning of Apocalypse&#x27;s return, X-Force seeks to kill him, but when they discover he is a child, Psylocke decides to protect him, believing they can rehabilitate him and train him as a force for good. To the shock of the rest of the team, Fantomex fatally shoots the child.

In a 2011 storyline, as X-Force succeed in stopping the Deathloks inside the World, the home of all Weapon projects, it is revealed that Ultimaton, guardian of the World, is keeping watch over an incubating young boy labeled En Sabah Nur, aged 847 days.

During the 2012 storyline &quot;Dark Angel Saga&quot;, it is revealed that Apocalypse had fathered a son with Autumn Rolfson and she kept this a secret from Apocalypse out of fear of what he would do to him. At the end of the storyline, it is revealed that Fantomex creates a clone Apocalypse which he helps raise to the age of a teenager in an artificial world, where the clone knows Fantomex as the kindly &quot;Uncle Cluster&quot; who taught him to use his abilities for good. The boy, code-named Genesis, helps X-force fight Archangel and when the battle is over, Fantomex enrolls him in the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning.

====Evan Sabahnur====
In &quot;Wolverine &amp; the X-Men&quot; #4 (March 2012), Evan Sabahnur a.k.a. Genesis is admitted as a student to the Jean Grey School of Higher Learning, where his classmates notice his resemblance to Apocalypse. En is worried when a visiting Deathlok, who reveals to the students their likely futures, shows reluctance to do so with Evan. When Evan presses him, Deathlok informs him that this is what Evan is at the school to discover. Deathlok then tells Wolverine that Evan has great potential and may be a great savior, or a conqueror.

After being called Kid Apocalypse by Kid Omega, Evan begins learning about Apocalypse and is saddened that he himself looks like the villain, raising the possibility of a future that Evan rejects. After saving Angel and discovering that he possesses the ability to see the essence of those he looks upon, Evan asks him to tell him what he sees when he looks at him. Angel tells Evan he sees only goodness inside him, which makes Evan happy, so he thanks Angel for being a good friend. In fact, Angel lied, as the only thing he could see was the dark image of Apocalypse.

A new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, led by Wolverine&#x27;s son Daken, kidnaps Evan during a field trip to Genosha&#x27;s remains. Hoping to sway the boy into becoming Apocalypse, the Brotherhood reveals to him that he is a clone and tells him of X-Force&#x27;s assassination of the child En Sabah Nur from which he was cloned and the falsehood of his life under the tutelage of Fantomex. After the Brotherhood reveals that they have killed Fantomex and further tortures Evan, Daken tells En that he has a choice: either immediately ascend as Apocalypse and kill the Brotherhood as revenge for the death of &quot;Uncle Cluster&quot;, or let the rest of X-Force die at the Brotherhood&#x27;s hands to avenge the death of the original boy En Sabah Nur and to prevent X-Force from killing Evan the way they killed Apocalypse and Archangel.

Daken offers Evan a suit of Apocalypse&#x27;s Celestial armor to do with what he will, secretly planning to control the new Apocalypse through the psychic abilities of the Shadow King. After Deadpool&#x27;s failed attempt to rescue Evan, the boy dons the Celestial armor to prevent Wolverine&#x27;s death at Daken&#x27;s hands and nearly kills Brotherhood members Sabretooth and Mystique. Enraged by the lies he has been told and filled with new-found power from Apocalypse&#x27;s armor, Evan prepares to attack Wolverine himself, but Wolverine convinces him of the ultimate futility of revenge. Evan is later visited by Deadpool at the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. Deadpool tells Evan he is not Apocalypse and that Deadpool will always be there for him when he needs him.

Later Deadpool enlists Evan and Quentin&#x27;s help to help him saving his daughter Eleanor Camacho from the Flag-Smasher, with Evan promising Quentin a bloodbath and some action to motivate him. He manages to save Ellie&#x27;s life and proposes Deadpool to let Quentin erase from the girl&#x27;s mind every memory of the ordeal. Deadpool loudly refuses and to Evan&#x27;s surprise, he hugs him and tells him to stay in school.

During the 2014 &quot;AXIS&quot; storyline, Evan is one of many mutants captured by the Red Skull on the island of Genosha. During a fierce battle between the Avengers, the united X-Men, as well as a group of villains who all attempt to defeat the Red Onslaught, Evan assists Kid Omega in preventing Red Onslaught&#x27;s telepathy from affecting the combined combatants. In the energy released when the Scarlet Witch and Doctor Doom use the combined power of order and chaos spells to suppress the Red Skull&#x27;s personality in favor of the sliver of Professor X&#x27;s that still exists in his brain, Evan ascends to adulthood, stepping out of the rubble with a looming, muscular body and the presence and appearance of Apocalypse. Deadpool even comments on how changed Evan is. When Havok and Cyclops argue with Steve Rogers and the new Captain America over who should take custody of the body of Red Skull, Evan convinces the Summers brothers that Professor X is dead and they have other problems to deal with. Acting as Apocalypse, &#x27;En&#x27; vows to lead the mutants in an uprising, rallying the converted X-Men into helping him take Avengers Tower—now disregarded by the inverted Avengers after they captured almost all other heroes using Pym particles—to use as the site where he will detonate a Celestial-based &#x27;gene-bomb&#x27; to wipe out all humans not carrying the X-gene. With only the inverted villains present at the original confrontation to oppose the inverted X-Men and Avengers, the gene bomb is nearly detonated, but is contained thanks to the sacrifice of Carnage. As Apocalypse broods on his failure, the decapitated Deadpool—converted to a peaceful version of himself called Zenpool by the inversion—convinces Apocalypse that now is the time to be heroic, proclaiming that nobody liked En Sabah Nur but everyone appreciated Evan, as he represented the hope that nurture could beat nature. Inspired by Deadpool&#x27;s words, Apocalypse turns on the X-Men and the Avengers, allowing the Astonishing Avengers (along with non-inverted heroes Steve Rogers and Spider-Man) to retrieve the White Skull and undo the inversion. At the conclusion of the storyline, Evan is shown on the run with Deadpool.

===Apocalypse Wars===
During the &quot;Apocalypse Wars&quot; storyline, the Extraordinary X-Men travel thousands of years into Earth&#x27;s future in order to rescue Colossus and his team of young mutants after they were investigating the sudden appearance of six hundred new mutant signatures in Tokyo. Arriving into Earth&#x27;s future, the X-Men found themselves in a destroyed New York City and soon discovered that at some point Apocalypse had risen and what remained of Earth after his ascension became the Omega World, a huge structure composed of bubble worlds. The ones who survived the Great Trials lived on Omega World under Apocalypse&#x27;s rule as he functioned as the Omega World&#x27;s heart, keeping it alive, while his Horsemen functioned as its antibodies, cleansing the structure of anything that could harm their master. Omega World crumbled as the result of Apocalypse being fatally wounded by Nightcrawler. Storm was forced to take Apocalypse back to the present with them so they could undo the transformation of Colossus, who was turned into a Horseman, however, before he could restore Colossus back to normal, Apocalypse instead teleported him away, sending him to Clan Akkaba. It is left unknown if this Apocalypse was actually a future version of Evan or Apocalypse himself using a new host body. Apocalypse was kept at X-Haven, inside a cell specially built to contain him by Forge, and later after again retrieving Colossus, Forge tried to find a way to cure him by reverse engineering Apocalypse&#x27;s powers but failed. During the World-Eater&#x27;s attack on Limbo, Nightcrawler agreed to free Apocalypse in exchange for a cure for his friend. After returning Colossus to his normal self, Nightcrawler indeed released Apocalypse from his prison, however what Apocalypse did not expect was that Nightcrawler would throw him into the vortex created by the World-Eater to consume Limbo, seemingly killing him in the process.

===Degeneration===
Apocalypse is later revealed to be back on Earth, no details about what the Celestials did to him were revealed, and is shown performing experiments to create an immortal vessel which he can then use as a host for his vast power and consciousness by utilizing a modified ancient Celestial technology known as the Finch, which can repair genetic decay. His efforts are not in vain, as he begins to impose his own consciousness onto a human test subject, the fourth attempt, lending it his own regenerative powers to withstand the assault. However, the test subject resists the process, causing a massive chain reaction that bathes Apocalypse and the subject in a wave of energy. Apocalypse&#x27;s mind and body are torn apart. He finds his mind wandering to that of his birth before his being is fused, mixed, and exploded along with this human form. Once the wave subsides, Apocalypse finds himself in a strange new land that he deduces was the result of the explosion within the Celestial machine that must have caused a dimensional rift which threw him into another dimension. He also discovers that his body has changed as well. Not only does he discover that he can bleed, something that should be impossible with his injury-resistant mutant physiology, but after a fight against a resident of the twisted dimension, which he was able to defeat, Apocalypse learns that his body is actively refusing physiological mutation. Needing to breathe air for the first time in centuries, he comes to a shocking truth as he watches his hand turn from its usual mutated appearance back to a human form: he&#x27;s becoming human.

After degenerating into an ape form, he is taken out by his previous human test subjects who, unlike him, have ascended in form after being empowered by Apocalypse&#x27;s own DNA. He and other apes are tortured with the Finch, which was recovered and repaired by the human test subjects. When test subject D experiments on Apocalypse, he uses the last of his mutant power to try to transfer his mind into D and is finally able to possess him, which restores Apocalypse to his former glory and realizes that he had not been transported to another planet, rather the earlier explosion from the Finch had simply evolved his entire South American island, infusing his superior genetics into everything the blast wave struck, transforming it into the tribulation which he had been forced to endure. Apocalypse then gave his perfect host body a trial run as he killed the remaining test subjects, while reducing the entire island to rubble that was reclaimed by the sea.

Apocalypse was soon afterward captured by some mysterious force - later to be revealed as X-Man, Nate Grey - and was being held captive along with Kitty Pryde and anti-mutant senator Ashton Allen.

===Dawn of X===

During &quot;Dawn of X&quot;, Apocalypse accepts Xavier&#x27;s invitation to enter Krakoa and even is among the Quiet Council, a group of fourteen powerful and experienced mutants who serve as the island&#x27;s lawgivers. He takes up learning magic and acts as an advisor to the new Excalibur team. Mutants who lost their powers after M-Day can regain them by dying and undergoing Krakoan resurrection. In order to prevent mass suicide by depowered mutants in order to regain their powers, the Quiet Council of Krakoa devised the Crucible, a trial by combat where a depowered mutant must endure grueling physical and psychological attacks from Apocalypse before they can die and be resurrected.

Its also revealed that at an uncertain point in the distant past apparently before En Sabah Nur merged himself with the Celestial technology, he met and married his wife Genesis. Together with Genesis&#x27; sister Isca, they found and populated a living island known as Okkara. As time passed he and Genesis conceived four children, two sons and two daughters who eventually became their First Horsemen when the island was split by a force wielding the Twilight Sword. The mutant population were then led by Apocalypse and his family to fight the invading Daemons coming from the hellish reality of Amenth. During the war, the enemies&#x27; leader Annihilation tried to make a peace treaty with the mutants by offering a gift to them, but only if they would pass a test first. Genesis seemed to easily pass the test, but the gift Annihilation whispered to Genesis was not revealed. In the end, Genesis, the Horsemen, and Arakko decided to move to Amenth in order to hold off the Amenthi forces and deny Annihilation access to Earth by sealing the chasm, while leaving Apocalypse behind, since he wasn&#x27;t strong enough, much to his and Krakoa&#x27;s sorrow. However, before Genesis went to Amenth, she made Apocalypse promise to find and judge the succeeding mutants in following years to help them fight the threat.

===Fall of X===

Following Orchis&#x27; attack during the &quot;Fall of X&quot;, Apocalypse returned to Krakoa and found it dying due to a lack of mutant energy. To save it, Apocalypse asks the mutants present to donate their lives to feed it. Wrongslide and some generic mutants offer themselves up as sacrifices and Apocalypse killed them with a heavy heart.

When Krakoa&#x27;s Atlantean half returns from the White Hot Room and merges with its Pacific half, Apocalypse arrives on Krakoa and takes down Exodus who objected to Krakoa leaving for the White Hot Room. Upon learning that Krakoa has no need for Apocalypse&#x27;s ways anymore, Apocalypse goes on the attack and fights the X-Men until Jean talks him down. Upon seeing through the eyes of the mutants on Krakoa, Apocalypse leaves for Arakko. Meeting up with Orc, Apocalypse states that it is time for him to find an heir to his legacy.

==Powers and abilities==
Apocalypse is an ancient mutant who further augmented himself after merging with Celestial technology gaining in the process a variety of superhuman abilities. He is also among the rare subspecies of mutants that possess the additional gift of immortality. He has total control over the molecules of his body which enables him to alter his form as it suits him, such as allowing his body to become extremely malleable and flexible, enhance his physical abilities, transform his limbs into weapons, wings, or jets, regenerate from fatal injuries, generate a wide range of powers at will, and adapt his body to apparently any disease or hostile environment. He can also project and absorb energy; and is capable of telekinesis, telepathy, teleportation, forcefield generation, and technopathy. Thanks to the aid of his mutant abilities allowing him complete control over his body, special &quot;regeneration&quot; chambers, Celestial technology, and changing bodies, Apocalypse has further enhanced his abilities and now he can generate almost any mutant power at his will.

Aside from his superhuman powers, Apocalypse is extraordinarily intelligent and a scientific genius with knowledge in various areas of science and technology including physics, engineering, genetics, and biology, all of which are more advanced than conventional science. Apocalypse has knowledge of Celestial technology that he uses for his own applications, such as altering mutants or humans. Apocalypse is also a skilled demagogue and a master strategist.

Apocalypse&#x27;s blood can heal other mutants, but is fatal for humans. Apocalypse&#x27;s blood can also restore his de-powered mutant descendants as is seen when a large dose of Apocalypse&#x27;s blood regenerates the lost body part of Chamber and gave him a look similar to Apocalypse.

==Other versions==
===Age of Apocalypse===

In the &quot;Age of Apocalypse&quot; storyline, Apocalypse awakens ten years before Cable would arrive, witnessing the accidental death of Charles Xavier by his son, attacks humanity and conquers much of the Earth. In this universe, his son is alleged to be Holocaust/Nemesis.

===Heroic Age===
In the 2010 &quot;Heroic Age&quot; storyline, versions of Apocalypse and his Horsemen from a possible future appear in the Avengers Tower after Kang breaks time itself. After a fight with the Avengers, he and his Horsemen disappear.

===House of M===
In the &quot;House of M&quot; universe created by Scarlet Witch, Apocalypse was installed as the ruler of North Africa by Magneto. He was apparently killed by Black Bolt after a failed attempt to assassinate King T&#x27;Challa at Magneto&#x27;s behest.

===Messiah War===
In a future timeline seen in the 2009 storyline &quot;Messiah War&quot;, a greatly weakened Apocalypse is attacked by Stryfe and Bishop, but he survives the attack. Afterward, Apocalypse contacts Archangel in the future and begs him to kill him. Archangel refuses and instead hands over some of his techno organic wing blades to him, telling Apocalypse he no longer holds any control over him. Coming into contact with the blades rejuvenates Apocalypse and he offers to join forces with Archangel to kill Stryfe who is on the verge of killing X-Force, Cable, Bishop, as well as Hope Summers. Archangel takes Apocalypse to a Celestial ship, where Apocalypse is then fully restored and wants to avenge what Stryfe did to him. Just as Stryfe is on the verge of taking Hope for himself, Apocalypse and Archangel confront and defeat Stryfe. Apocalypse releases Hope into Cable&#x27;s care, but says that he will return for her eventually. Apocalypse then drags Stryfe away, intending to use him as a new host body. Stryfe manages to escape and travels back in time to the present.

===Mutant X===
In the &quot;Mutant X&quot; universe, Apocalypse is an ally of the X-Men.

===Ultimate Marvel===
The &quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot; imprint title features an alternate version of Apocalypse who is an entity worshiped by Sinister. After completing a series of murders, Sinister is transformed into Apocalypse who intends to conquer the planet. The heroes are unable to defeat him until the Phoenix Force appears and destroys him. Although his abilities are never directly stated in total, he is shown to be capable of negating other mutant powers, adapting mutant powers into his own by exposure to them and &quot;evolving&quot; as he is fought. Following a heavy assault by the X-Men, Fantastic Four, and S.H.I.E.L.D. forces, he emerges from an explosion in a red and silver version of his traditional blue cybernetic battle armor. He is also capable of adapting to and overcoming Professor Xavier&#x27;s psychic assault despite his training during his time in the future with Cable. Cable makes the most concrete implication that evolving is the major element of his powers when he remarks that Xavier must kill Apocalypse quickly before he adapts to his attacks and becomes immune to the telepathy. Apocalypse is finally dispelled by Phoenix while leaving an alive Mister Sinister.

His actual nature is unknown: he proclaims himself to be the first mutant (like in the mainstream series) and Phoenix readings portray him as an ancient being, but this is later contradicted by Nick Fury&#x27;s revelation in Ultimatum, that explains mutants are a recent creation of the humans. However he later appears again as part of Sinister&#x27;s psychosis.

<doc id="373982" wikidata="Q5370663" url="?curid=373982" title="Emergency Vets">
<text>Emergency Vets is a reality television series that aired on Animal Planet. First aired in 1998, it depicts the working and outside lives of the veterinarians at Alameda East Veterinary Hospital in Denver, Colorado, plus the animals that they treat. At its peak of popularity, &quot;Emergency Vets&quot; alternated with &quot;The Crocodile Hunter&quot; as Animal Planet&#x27;s most popular show.

The show stopped first-run production because Alameda East was occupied with building and eventually moving into a new facility in Denver. In 2004, a new documentary called &quot;E-Vets: The Cutting Edge&quot; aired on Animal Planet, showing the changes in Alameda East Veterinary Hospital since the show&#x27;s final episode. The documentary scored good ratings and has been rerun several times as part of the &quot;Whoa! Sunday&quot; umbrella anthology show on Animal Planet, as well as inspiring a follow-up episode first aired in 2005 that took viewers on a tour of the new Alameda East facility while showing cases of animals receiving cutting-edge treatment at the new hospital. Another documentary, &quot;Emergency Vets 20 Most Unusual Cases&quot;, aired on &quot;Whoa! Sunday&quot; in 2006, featuring 20 cases from the series including follow-ups with the families and interviews with the doctors involved.

In 2007, Animal Planet announced that the real-life drama at Alameda East would return to prime-time airwaves under a new title, &quot;E-Vet Interns&quot;. The new series features six new veterinary interns during their first year of residency practice at the new Alameda East hospital, as well as familiar faces Dr. Robert Taylor, Dr. Kevin Fitzgerald, Dr. Preston Stubbs, and Dr. Holly Knor. In preparation for the new show&#x27;s debut on January 22, 2007, Animal Planet aired a new E-Vets special, &quot;E-Vets: Things Pets Swallow&quot;, featuring memorable cases from the &quot;Emergency Vets&quot; years dealing with dramatic objects that animals have ingested.

<doc id="373986" wikidata="Q5374" url="?curid=373986" title="Gibbs phenomenon">
<text>In mathematics, the Gibbs phenomenon is the oscillatory behavior of the Fourier series of a piecewise continuously differentiable periodic function around a jump discontinuity. The formula_1th partial Fourier series of the function (formed by summing the formula_1 lowest constituent sinusoids of the Fourier series of the function) produces large peaks around the jump which overshoot and undershoot the function values. As more sinusoids are used, this approximation error approaches a limit of about 9% of the jump, though the infinite Fourier series sum does eventually converge almost everywhere.

The Gibbs phenomenon was observed by experimental physicists and was believed to be due to imperfections in the measuring apparatus, but it is in fact a mathematical result. It is one cause of ringing artifacts in signal processing. It is named after Josiah Willard Gibbs.

==Description==


The Gibbs phenomenon is a behavior of the Fourier series of a function with a jump discontinuity and is described as the following:As more Fourier series constituents or components are taken, the Fourier series shows the first overshoot in the oscillatory behavior around the jump point approaching ~ 9% of the (full) jump and this oscillation does not disappear but gets closer to the point so that the integral of the oscillation approaches zero.At the jump point, the Fourier series gives the average of the function&#x27;s both side limits toward the point.

=== Square wave example ===
The three pictures on the right demonstrate the Gibbs phenomenon for a square wave (with peak-to-peak amplitude of formula_3 from formula_4 to formula_5 and the periodicity formula_6) whose formula_1th partial Fourier series is
formula_8

where formula_9. More precisely, this square wave is the function formula_10 which equals formula_11 between formula_12 and formula_13 and formula_14 between formula_13 and formula_16 for every integer formula_17; thus, this square wave has a jump discontinuity of peak-to-peak height formula_3 at every integer multiple of formula_19.

As more sinusoidal terms are added (i.e., increasing formula_1), the error of the partial Fourier series converges to a fixed height. But because the width of the error continues to narrow, the area of the error – and hence the energy of the error – converges to 0. The square wave analysis reveals that the error exceeds the height (from zero) formula_11 of the square wave by
formula_22()

or about 9% of the full jump formula_3. More generally, at any discontinuity of a piecewise continuously differentiable function with a jump of formula_3, the formula_1th partial Fourier series of the function will (for a very large formula_1 value) overshoot this jump by an error approaching formula_27 at one end and undershoot it by the same amount at the other end; thus the &quot;full jump&quot; in the partial Fourier series will be about 18% larger than the full jump in the original function. At the discontinuity, the partial Fourier series will converge to the midpoint of the jump (regardless of the actual value of the original function at the discontinuity) as a consequence of Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem. The quantity
formula_28()
is sometimes known as the &quot;Wilbraham–Gibbs constant&quot;.

=== History ===
The Gibbs phenomenon was first noticed and analyzed by Henry Wilbraham in an 1848 paper. The paper attracted little attention until 1914 when it was mentioned in Heinrich Burkhardt&#x27;s review of mathematical analysis in Klein&#x27;s encyclopedia. In 1898, Albert A. Michelson developed a device that could compute and re-synthesize the Fourier series. A widespread anecdote says that when the Fourier coefficients for a square wave were input to the machine, the graph would oscillate at the discontinuities, and that because it was a physical device subject to manufacturing flaws, Michelson was convinced that the overshoot was caused by errors in the machine. In fact the graphs produced by the machine were not good enough to exhibit the Gibbs phenomenon clearly, and Michelson may not have noticed it as he made no mention of this effect in his paper about his machine or his later letters to &quot;Nature&quot;.

Inspired by correspondence in &quot;Nature&quot; between Michelson and A. E. H. Love about the convergence of the Fourier series of the square wave function, J. Willard Gibbs published a note in 1898 pointing out the important distinction between the limit of the graphs of the partial sums of the Fourier series of a sawtooth wave and the graph of the limit of those partial sums. In his first letter Gibbs failed to notice the Gibbs phenomenon, and the limit that he described for the graphs of the partial sums was inaccurate. In 1899 he published a correction in which he described the overshoot at the point of discontinuity (&quot;Nature&quot;, April 27, 1899, p. 606). In 1906, Maxime Bôcher gave a detailed mathematical analysis of that overshoot, coining the term &quot;Gibbs phenomenon&quot; and bringing it into widespread use.

After the existence of Henry Wilbraham&#x27;s paper became widely known, in 1925 Horatio Scott Carslaw remarked, &quot;We may still call this property of Fourier&#x27;s series (and certain other series) Gibbs&#x27;s phenomenon; but we must no longer claim that the property was first discovered by Gibbs.&quot;

=== Explanation ===
Informally, the Gibbs phenomenon reflects the difficulty inherent in approximating a discontinuous function by a &quot;finite&quot; series of continuous sinusoidal waves. It is important to put emphasis on the word &quot;finite&quot;, because even though every partial sum of the Fourier series overshoots around each discontinuity it is approximating, the limit of summing an infinite number of sinusoidal waves does not. The overshoot peaks moves closer and closer to the discontinuity as more terms are summed, so convergence is possible.

There is no contradiction (between the overshoot error converging to a non-zero height even though the infinite sum has no overshoot), because the overshoot peaks move toward the discontinuity. The Gibbs phenomenon thus exhibits pointwise convergence, but not uniform convergence. For a piecewise continuously differentiable (class &quot;C&quot;1) function, the Fourier series converges to the function at &quot;every point&quot; except at jump discontinuities. At jump discontinuities, the infinite sum will converge to the jump discontinuity&#x27;s midpoint (i.e. the average of the values of the function on either side of the jump), as a consequence of Dirichlet&#x27;s theorem.

The Gibbs phenomenon is closely related to the principle that the smoothness of a function controls the decay rate of its Fourier coefficients. Fourier coefficients of smoother functions will more rapidly decay (resulting in faster convergence), whereas Fourier coefficients of discontinuous functions will slowly decay (resulting in slower convergence). For example, the discontinuous square wave has Fourier coefficients formula_29 that decay only at the rate of formula_30, while the continuous triangle wave has Fourier coefficients formula_31 that decay at a much faster rate of formula_32.

This only provides a partial explanation of the Gibbs phenomenon, since Fourier series with absolutely convergent Fourier coefficients would be uniformly convergent by the Weierstrass M-test and would thus be unable to exhibit the above oscillatory behavior. By the same token, it is impossible for a discontinuous function to have absolutely convergent Fourier coefficients, since the function would thus be the uniform limit of continuous functions and therefore be continuous, a contradiction. See .

=== Solutions ===
Since the Gibbs phenomenon comes from undershooting, it may be eliminated by using kernels that are never negative, such as the Fejér kernel.

In practice, the difficulties associated with the Gibbs phenomenon can be ameliorated by using a smoother method of Fourier series summation, such as Fejér summation or Riesz summation, or by using sigma-approximation. Using a continuous wavelet transform, the wavelet Gibbs phenomenon never exceeds the Fourier Gibbs phenomenon. Also, using the discrete wavelet transform with Haar basis functions, the Gibbs phenomenon does not occur at all in the case of continuous data at jump discontinuities, and is minimal in the discrete case at large change points. In wavelet analysis, this is commonly referred to as the Longo phenomenon. In the polynomial interpolation setting, the Gibbs phenomenon can be mitigated using the S-Gibbs algorithm.

== Formal mathematical description of the Gibbs phenomenon ==
Let formula_33 be a piecewise continuously differentiable function which is periodic with some period formula_34. Suppose that at some point formula_35, the left limit formula_36 and right limit formula_37 of the function formula_38 differ by a non-zero jump of formula_3:
formula_40

For each positive integer formula_1 ≥ 1, let formula_42 be the formula_1th partial Fourier series (formula_44 can be treated as a mathematical operator on functions.)
formula_45

where the Fourier coefficients formula_46 for integers formula_17 are given by the usual formulae
formula_48
formula_49
formula_50
formula_51

Then we have
formula_52
and
formula_53
but
formula_54

More generally, if formula_55 is any sequence of real numbers which converges to formula_35 as formula_57, and if the jump of formula_58 is positive then
formula_59
and
formula_60

If instead the jump of formula_3 is negative, one needs to interchange limit superior (formula_62) with limit inferior (formula_63), and also interchange the formula_64 and formula_65 signs, in the above two inequalities.

=== Proof of the Gibbs phenomenon in a general case ===
Stated again, let formula_33 be a piecewise continuously differentiable function which is periodic with some period formula_34, and this function has multiple jump discontinuity points denoted formula_68 where formula_69 and so on. At each discontinuity, the amount of the vertical full jump is formula_70.

Then, formula_38 can be expressed as the sum of a continuous function formula_72 and a multi-step function formula_73 which is the sum of step functions such as

formula_74formula_75formula_76

formula_42 as the formula_78th partial Fourier series of formula_79 will converge well at all formula_80 points except points near discontinuities formula_68. Around each discontinuity point formula_68, formula_83 will only have the Gibbs phenomenon of its own (the maximum oscillatory convergence error of ~ 9% of the jump formula_84, as shown in the square wave analysis) because other functions are continuous (formula_85) or flat zero (formula_86 where formula_87) around that point. This proves how the Gibbs phenomenon occurs at every discontinuity.

== Signal processing explanation ==
From a signal processing point of view, the Gibbs phenomenon is the step response of a low-pass filter, and the oscillations are called ringing or ringing artifacts. Truncating the Fourier transform of a signal on the real line, or the Fourier series of a periodic signal (equivalently, a signal on the circle), corresponds to filtering out the higher frequencies with an ideal (brick-wall) low-pass filter. This can be represented as convolution of the original signal with the impulse response of the filter (also known as the kernel), which is the sinc function. Thus, the Gibbs phenomenon can be seen as the result of convolving a Heaviside step function (if periodicity is not required) or a square wave (if periodic) with a sinc function: the oscillations in the sinc function cause the ripples in the output.
In the case of convolving with a Heaviside step function, the resulting function is exactly the integral of the sinc function, the sine integral; for a square wave the description is not as simply stated. For the step function, the magnitude of the undershoot is thus exactly the integral of the left tail until the first negative zero: for the normalized sinc of unit sampling period, this is formula_88 The overshoot is accordingly of the same magnitude: the integral of the right tail or (equivalently) the difference between the integral from negative infinity to the first positive zero minus 1 (the non-overshooting value).

The overshoot and undershoot can be understood thus: kernels are generally normalized to have integral 1, so they result in a mapping of constant functions to constant functions – otherwise they have gain. The value of a convolution at a point is a linear combination of the input signal, with coefficients (weights) the values of the kernel.

If a kernel is non-negative, such as for a Gaussian kernel, then the value of the filtered signal will be a convex combination of the input values (the coefficients (the kernel) integrate to 1, and are non-negative), and will thus fall between the minimum and maximum of the input signal – it will not undershoot or overshoot. If, on the other hand, the kernel assumes negative values, such as the sinc function, then the value of the filtered signal will instead be an affine combination of the input values and may fall outside of the minimum and maximum of the input signal, resulting in undershoot and overshoot, as in the Gibbs phenomenon.

Taking a longer expansion – cutting at a higher frequency – corresponds in the frequency domain to widening the brick-wall, which in the time domain corresponds to narrowing the sinc function and increasing its height by the same factor, leaving the integrals between corresponding points unchanged. This is a general feature of the Fourier transform: widening in one domain corresponds to narrowing and increasing height in the other. This results in the oscillations in sinc being narrower and taller, and (in the filtered function after convolution) yields oscillations that are narrower (and thus with smaller &quot;area&quot;) but which do &quot;not&quot; have reduced &quot;magnitude&quot;: cutting off at any finite frequency results in a sinc function, however narrow, with the same tail integrals. This explains the persistence of the overshoot and undershoot.

Thus, the features of the Gibbs phenomenon are interpreted as follows:
* the undershoot is due to the impulse response having a negative tail integral, which is possible because the function takes negative values;
* the overshoot offsets this, by symmetry (the overall integral does not change under filtering);
* the persistence of the oscillations is because increasing the cutoff narrows the impulse response but does not reduce its integral – the oscillations thus move towards the discontinuity, but do not decrease in magnitude.

== Square wave analysis ==
We examine the formula_1th partial Fourier series formula_42 of a square wave formula_10 with the periodicity formula_6 and a discontinuity of a vertical &quot;full&quot; jump formula_3 from formula_94 at formula_95. Because the case of odd formula_1 is very similar, let us just deal with the case when formula_1 is even:

formula_98

with formula_99. (formula_100 where formula_101 is the number of non-zero sinusoidal Fourier series components so there are literatures using formula_101 instead of formula_1.) Substituting formula_95 (a point of discontinuity), we obtain
formula_105
as claimed above. (The first term that only survives is the average of the Fourier series.)

Next, we find the first maximum of the oscillation around the discontinuity formula_95 by checking the first and second derivatives of formula_42. The first condition for the maximum is that the first derivative equals to zero as

formula_108

where the 2nd equality is from one of Lagrange&#x27;s trigonometric identities. Solving this condition gives formula_109 for integers formula_110 excluding multiples of formula_111 to avoid the zero denominator, so formula_112 and their negatives are allowed.

The second derivative of formula_42 at formula_114 is

formula_115formula_116

Thus, the first maximum occurs at formula_117 (formula_118) and formula_42 at this formula_120 value is
formula_121

If we introduce the normalized sinc function formula_122 for formula_123, we can rewrite this as
formula_124

For a sufficiently large formula_1, the expression in the square brackets is a Riemann sum approximation to the integral formula_126 (more precisely, it is a midpoint rule approximation with spacing formula_127). Since the sinc function is continuous, this approximation converges to the integral as formula_128. Thus, we have

formula_129

which was claimed in the previous section. A similar computation shows

formula_130

==Consequences==
The Gibbs phenomenon is undesirable because it causes artifacts, namely clipping from the overshoot and undershoot, and ringing artifacts from the oscillations. In the case of low-pass filtering, these can be reduced or eliminated by using different low-pass filters.

In MRI, the Gibbs phenomenon causes artifacts in the presence of adjacent regions of markedly differing signal intensity. This is most commonly encountered in spinal MRIs where the Gibbs phenomenon may simulate the appearance of syringomyelia.

The Gibbs phenomenon manifests as a cross pattern artifact in the discrete Fourier transform of an image, where most images (e.g. micrographs or photographs) have a sharp discontinuity between boundaries at the top / bottom and left / right of an image. When periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the Fourier transform, this jump discontinuity is represented by continuum of frequencies along the axes in reciprocal space (i.e. a cross pattern of intensity in the Fourier transform).

And although this article mainly focused on the difficulty with trying to construct discontinuities without artifacts in the time domain with only a partial Fourier series, it is also important to consider that because the inverse Fourier transform is extremely similar to the Fourier transform, there equivalently is difficulty with trying to construct discontinuities in the frequency domain using only a partial Fourier series. Thus for instance because idealized brick-wall and rectangular filters have discontinuities in the frequency domain, their exact representation in the time domain necessarily requires an infinitely-long sinc filter impulse response, since a finite impulse response will result in Gibbs rippling in the frequency response near cut-off frequencies, though this rippling can be reduced by windowing finite impulse response filters (at the expense of wider transition bands).
