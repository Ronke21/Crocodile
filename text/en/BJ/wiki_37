<text>The Paklenica karst river canyon is a national park in Croatia. It is near Starigrad, northern Dalmatia, on the southern slopes of Velebit mountain, not far from Zadar. It contains two canyons, Mala (Small) and Velika (Big) Paklenica.

==History==
The area of South Velebit has been inhabited since prehistoric times. It is believed that, during the last ice age, the area was probably inhabited by small groups of Paleolithic hunters/gatherers, as elsewhere in the Mediterranean. Sea level must have been lower than today, and the Velebit Channel was a wide valley with a river flowing through it. The highest parts of the Velebit were covered with glaciers. When sea level began to rise in the late ice age, people moved to higher, hilly areas. The earliest records of humans in Velebit – Mesolithic flint tools found in Vaganačka Cave under Veliko Rujno – date back to this era.

Approximately eight thousand years ago, the first cattle breeders and farmers arrived in the area, bringing wheat, domestic goats and sheep, as well as the knowledge of their breeding. Hunter-gathering lost its importance, and livestock-rearing began on Velebit. Plenty of material evidence, such as bones of domestic animals, tools and equipment used by prehistoric shepherds and decorated clay tableware, was found in the caves that served as shelter for people and cattle.
During the last two thousand years BC, during the Bronze Age, the first fortifications and stone buildings were erected by Liburian peoples. They could serve as shelter to the population from the surrounding villages in case of danger, and some of them may have been permanent settlements where the local rulers had their seats. In addition, they oversaw important cattle and trade routes leading to Velebit and further to Lika via Paklenica or Rujan. Some of them served to oversee navigation. They are now destroyed, but ring-shaped mounds (&quot;gromila&quot;, pl. &quot;gromile&quot;) up to several meters in height can still be seen in some places. In the immediate vicinity of the fortifications, casket heaps – deposits of large round stone under which former rulers were buried in caskets made of stone tablets – have been found. Most of them have been dug out and the graves robbed, but they are still visible, as in the area of hamlet Ljubotić in Tribanj.

Over the last two thousand years BC, the east coast of the Adriatic was gradually conquered by the Roman legions. After the Roman province of Dalmatia was founded in the early 1st century AD, permanent Roman reign was established. Starigrad (Roman name: Argyruntum) was established at the time, and it soon developed into an important trading center. In the 4th century AD, Emperor Tiberius had it fortified with walls and towers. The town cemetery was situated by the road that led southwest of the town. Plenty of archaeological findings were collected from approximately 400 explored graves – jewelry, glassware and metalware, weapons and tools. The most interesting finding is certainly the ancient glass collection – as many as 146 vessels of different forms (bowls, glasses, bottled) – kept in the Zadar Museum of Archeology.

Life in Argyruntum came to a standstill in the early 4th century AD. The era of peace was interrupted by attacks of tribal peoples that contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire in the west. In an attempt to bring the Adriatic coast back into the Empire, East Roman Emperor Justinian built a system of fortifications to secure navigation and protect the local population. The ruins of forts and towers above Modrič and near Sveta Trojica in Tribanj are parts of this defensive system that briefly postponed the final decline of the ancient world in the Adriatic.

The arrival of Croats in this area began in the early Middle Ages. The earliest preserved traces of their presence are the chapels, St. George (Sv. Juraj) in Rovanjska, St. Peter (Sv. Petar) in Starigrad, and St. Mary Magdalene (Sv. Marija Magdalena or Trstenica) built from the 9th or 12th century AD. Two forts – Večka Kula and Paklarić – were probably erected in the late Middle Ages (14th–16th century).

Near the entrance to the Velika Paklenica is an artificial tunnel complex built for Josip Broz Tito during the tension between Yugoslavia and the USSR in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

== Geological features ==
The most attractive and most valuable parts of South Velebit are surely the impressive canyons of Velika Paklenica and Mala Paklenica. Velika Paklenica canyon is 14 km long and 500–800 m wide. In its narrowest part around the Bunkers, the canyon is only 50 m wide. Vertical cliffs rise above both sides of the canyon up to a height of over 700 m. The most attractive part is the area around the steep drop of the stream downstream from Anića luka, where steep cliffs rise directly above the stream, forming the narrowest part of the canyon between Anića luka and the parking lot. Mala Paklenica Canyon is of lesser dimension, and the torrent running through it is much less powerful. It is 12 km long and 400–500 m wide. In its narrowest part, it is only 10 m wide, while the surrounding cliffs rise up to a height of 650 m.

The central part of the Park is distinctive for the relief complex of Borovnik and Crni vrh, with the valley of Mala Močila and Velika Močila nearby. In terms of relief, Velika Močila is a very interesting bowl-shaped valley at an altitude 850 m asl, surrounded by Crni vrh (1 110 m asl), Škiljina kosa (1 015 m asl) and Zeleni brig (842 m asl), while Borovnik, named after the black pine forest, stretches along the south edge.

The east part of the Park is very differentiated geomorphologically, inaccessible and wild. Further to the east, this zone of wilderness transforms into an area of milder forms around Malo Libinje and Veliko Libinje, karstic plateaus with numerous pits, the bottoms of which were mostly treated.

The highest area of Paklenica National Park is the narrow ridge of Velebit, 1 to 3 km wide. The highest peak of Velebit – Vaganski vrh (1 757 m asl) is also here. The area of Paklenica National Park is one of the most completely explored areas in Croatia in terms of speleology. 76 speleological objects are known and have been explored in the Park, namely 39 pits and 37 caves. We will mention some of the most interesting speleological objects in the National Park. Vodarica Pit is the longest cave in Velebit at 300 meters, Precipice on Bunovac (534 m) is the deepest object in Central and South Velebit.

Watertight sediments are situated beneath very porous karstic deposits of carbonate rock in the extended part of Velika paklenica, Brezimenjača, and in the spring parts of Mala paklenica and the occasional flow of Orljača. This is why Paklenica National Park has several permanent or occasional flows and many permanent springs. The permanent springs of high-quality drinking water are Stražbenica, Kontinovo vrilo, Crno vrilo, Velika Močila and Pećica.

Today there is no water flowing through Mala Paklenica.

==Flora==

The wealth of flora is reflected in the list of 1,000 plant species and subspecies recorded to date, 79 of them endemic. The great diversity, the presence of relict, endemic, rare, statutorily protected species make the Park a very valuable floristic area, not just in Croatia, but in Europe and the world as well.

The forest phenomenon is one of the main reasons why the South Velebit area was proclaimed a national park. Areas of oak and oriental hornbeam forests, beech forest, black pine forests, and fern forest, can all be found in the park.
In 2017, the beech forests within the national park were added to the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe because of their testimony to the ecological history of forest dynamics within Europe since the last Ice Age. 
==Fauna==

The diverse habitats in Paklenica and the vertical stratification provide home to a diverse fauna. Invertebrates are relatively poorly explored, attractive insects like diurnal butterflies are well explored. Over 40 species of amphibians and reptiles are found, the endangered Orsini&#x27;s viper is a highlight.

Birds are the most numerous group of vertebrates, with 230 species recorded to date. The world of birds is represented by 102 species of nesting birds found in the broader park area. The nesting bird group includes a community of birds inhabiting rocks and cliffs in the canyons of Velika Paklenica and Mala Paklenica, with 24 bird species. A special value is added to the park by the endangered and rare bird species such as the golden eagle, peregrine falcon, short-toed eagle and goshawk. Forest areas are rich with woodpeckers, the rarest among them being the white-backed woodpecker and middle spotted woodpecker.

There are also 53 species of mammals at the park, the roe deer and chamois are highlights, while the brown bear is the biggest predator. In the caves there is a host of interesting underground animals such as crabs, mites, Nematodes, aquatic worms, spiders, pseudoscorpion, beetles and bats.

==Tourism==
Hiking is the only way to really get to know Paklenica. The Park area contains 150–200 km of trails and paths, from those intended for tourists, leading from Velika Paklenica Canyon to Manita peć cave, Lugarnica forest cottage and the mountain hut, to those intended for mountaineers, leading to the highest peaks of Velebit. The trails in the Park are marked with boards and mountaineering signs.

Paklenica National Park is the most visited climbing site in Croatia, and the largest in Southeast Europe. The close proximity of seawater gives this climbing site a special charm, making Paklenica Riviera an ideal place to combine climbing and water sports. Today, there are over 360 equipped and improved routes of various difficulty levels and lengths within Paklenica&#x27;s climbing sites, so each climber can find to their liking. The main climbing season begins in spring and goes on until late autumn.

<text>The Kornati archipelago () of Croatia, also known as the Stomorski islands, is located in the northern part of Dalmatia, south from Zadar and west from Šibenik, in the Šibenik-Knin County. With length and 89 islands, some large, some small, in a sea area of about , the Kornati are the densest archipelago in the Mediterranean Sea. From northwest to southeast (from the island of Balabra to Samograd), and from northeast to southwest (from Gangarol to Mana) they stretch for . The name of the archipelago is the plural form of the name of the largest island, called Kornat.

==Settlement==
There are no permanent settlements in Kornati. Simple houses in well-protected coves such as Vrulje, Kravjačica, Lavsa and others are used by mainland landowners as temporary shelters. Most of the land owners are from the island of Murter and Dugi Otok.

==Climate==
The average monthly temperature for January is , in July it is ; the average sea temperature in winter is and in summer .

==Geography==
Geographically the Kornati islands can be divided into two main groups - the Gornji Kornati or Upper Kornati, closer to the mainland, and the Donji Kornati or Lower Kornati, which are mostly facing the open sea in the southwest.

The islands known as Gornji Kornati include the northernmost island of Sit and the surrounding islets, divided by a channel from Žut and its surrounding islets to the south. Žut is the largest and most indented of these islands.

==National park==
In 1980, the 89 southernmost of the 140-odd islands, islets and reefs of the Kornati archipelago were declared a national park, Nacionalni Park Kornati, protecting the islands and their marine surroundings. The area covered by the national park mostly coincides with the Donji Kornati, which includes the island of Kornat and the surrounding islets, separated with a channel from the island of Piškera and the surrounding islets.

The national park includes 109 islands, of which 76 are less than 1 hectare in size. Of the total land surface area of Kornati, , or 85%, is stony, and only 5% has been cultivated.

The most important places on the Kornati islands are: the shallow channel Mala Proversa, the oval-shaped Taljurič island, Špinuta Bay, Stivina Bay, the fourth largest island Levrnaka, the second largest karst rock-area Tarac, Svršata Vela island, Mana island, Piškera island, Panitula Vela island, the picturesque Lavsa Bay, the resort island Ravni Žakan, Smokvica Vela island, the Opat peninsula, Samograd island, the Purara reserve for marine life, Vrgada and Gangarol islands.

The names of the islands Babina Guzica and Kurba Vela, which in Croatian refer to buttocks and prostitution, offer an opportunity to explain the many vulgar names officially given to many places in the Kornati archipelago. When Austrian surveyors came to record the archipelago at the end of the 19th century, their local guides mocked them by making up vulgar names for the various locations.

Kornat, the biggest of the islands with a total area of , comprises two-thirds of the park&#x27;s land area. Although the island is long, it is no wider than . The park is managed from the town of Murter, on the island of the same name, which is connected to the mainland by a drawbridge in the town of Tisno.

==Geology==
Most of the terrain in the Kornati islands is karst-limestone which, in the distant geological past, arose from sediment from the sea. In the stone on the islands there are numerous fossils of crustaceans and fish. In the area there examples of all the typical forms of karst: bizarre shapes formed by the atmosphere, unexplored caves, areas of flat rock and, above all, cliffs. Karst rock is porous, rapidly draining and dry, and so therefore are the Kornati islands. Numerous cisterns supply water for people and animals.

Human presence on the Kornati islands appear to extend back to the Neolithic Age, and the remains of Illyrian settlements were found on the island of Kornat. The presence of wealthy Romans is attested by the mosaic floors of Roman villas, and Kornat island has a small tower, &quot;Toreta&quot;, that was probably built in the 6th century AD. The island of Piškera was also inhabited during the Middle Ages and served as a storage point for fish. Archeological sites in Stražišče and Tarac, and on Levrnaka and Lavsa provide evidence that during the Roman era life on Kornati was very active. There are many buildings and it is known that there were also stone quarries.

During the long period of Venetian occupation, the islands were used for resupplying the Venetian fleet. Deforestation and subsequent erosion, and overgrazing by sheep and goats, for whose benefit the scrub was periodically burnt over, impoverished the fauna and depopulated the islands, which were purchased by citizens of Murter during the late 19th century.

==Fauna==

Apart from sea-gulls, which are the most numerous animals, there are some lizards and ring-snakes, and 69 varieties of butterfly, some amphibians and rodents. The local ichthyological fauna is also sparse. As regards marine life, the Kornati islands are typical of the Adriatic and the Mediterranean, but, due to the underwater relief, streams and special characteristics of the sea in this labyrinth, there are also some peculiarities: algae, coral and sponges. At one time the sea was the richest in the Adriatic for sponge hunters. The rare mollusc &quot;Pinna nobilis&quot; lives in the Kornati and is protected by law.

Not only the land but also the sea is within the protection of the National Park. Fishing is extremely limited in order to allow the regeneration of fish shoals that had been severely over-fished. According to tradition, the Mediterranean monk seal (&quot;Monachus albiventur&quot;) once lived among these islands. The name of the southernmost point on Vela Kurka (Mendo) is connected with this almost extinct species.

==Flora==
Vegetation on the islands is very sparse maquis. There have been 200 known varieties of Mediterranean plants, but they have degenerated. The most common plant is a tough variety of grass, but there are many scented and medicinal herbs: sage, feather grass and Xeranthemum, giving a fragrant spring, and during the year providing the best forage for bees. Olive trees account for about 80% of the land under cultivation, followed by vineyards, figs, orchards and vegetable gardens. It is thought that the Kornati islands were once covered with forests of Mediterranean holm oaks, &quot;Quercus ilex&quot;, but as open fires demanded a great deal of wood, the forests were slowly destroyed; the sole remnant is round the bay of Telašćica.

<doc id="362514" wikidata="Q1817613" url="?curid=362514" title="Progressive Unionist Party">
<text>The Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) is a minor unionist political party in Northern Ireland. It was formed from the Independent Unionist Group operating in the Shankill area of Belfast, becoming the PUP in 1979. Linked to the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and Red Hand Commando (RHC), for a time it described itself as &quot;the only left of centre unionist party&quot; in Northern Ireland, with its main support base in the loyalist working class communities of Belfast.

Since the Ulster Democratic Party&#x27;s dissolution in 2001, the PUP has been the sole party in Northern Ireland representing paramilitary loyalism.

The PUP has one elected representative on the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, Russell Watton, the party&#x27;s current leader.

==History==
The party was founded by Hugh Smyth in the mid-1970s as the &quot;Independent Unionist Group&quot; given the dissolution of the 1974 Volunteer Political Party. In 1977, two prominent members of the Northern Ireland Labour Party, David Overend and Jim McDonald, joined. Overend subsequently wrote many of the group&#x27;s policy documents, incorporating much of the NILP&#x27;s platform. In 1979, the group was renamed the &quot;Progressive Unionist Party&quot;.

Their position on the left of the political spectrum differentiates them from other unionist parties (such as the Ulster Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party) which are ideologically right-wing.
The party has had a degree of electoral success. In 1994, PUP leader Hugh Smyth became Lord Mayor of Belfast. 
===Northern Ireland Peace Process===
In 1995, shortly after the Combined Loyalist Military Command announced a ceasefire, former UVF member Billy Hutchinson, who was jailed for the murder of two Catholics in 1974, defined the relationship between the PUP and the UVF: &quot;The relationship is a very strict one in terms of acting as political confidants and providing political analysis for them, but it doesn&#x27;t go any deeper than that.&quot;
====Northern Ireland Forum====
The PUP participated in elections to the Northern Ireland Forum in May 1996. No constituency candidates were elected, but as one of the tenth best-performing parties on the list vote, they secured two seats, with Smyth and David Ervine both being elected. 

The PUP supported the Belfast Agreement.
====1997 general and local elections====
The PUP stood candidates for the first time at a general election in 1997: Hugh Smyth in South Antrim, Ervine in Belfast South and Kenny Donaldson in East Antrim. 
They amassed 10,928 votes, and no seats.

The party fared better at the simultaneous local elections, increasing their total number of councillors to seven. Ervine and Hutchinson joined Smyth in Belfast, and gains were made in North Down, Lisburn and Newtownabbey. 
====1998 Northern Ireland Assembly election====
Following the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, elections to the new Northern Ireland Assembly were held, which the PUP contested. Candidates included: Belfast councillors Smyth, Ervine and Billy Hutchinson, who stood in West, East and North Belfast, respectively. 

They registered 20,634 votes (2.55%), and both Ervine and Hutchinson were elected to the Assembly. Notably, Smyth missed out on getting elected in West Belfast, in which no unionist candidates were returned in that constituency. 

Incidentally, the Ulster Democratic Party failed to elect any candidates, making the PUP the only loyalist party to win representation in the Assembly. 

===Post-Good Friday Agreement===
====1999 European Parliament elections====
Ervine was the PUP candidate for the Northern Ireland constituency at the 1999 European elections. He polled 22,494 first-preference votes, and was not elected.

====2001 general and local elections====
The PUP stood two candidates for the 2001 general election: Ervine in Belfast East, and Dawn Purvis in Belfast South. In total, the party received 4,781 votes (0.6%), and no seats. Ervine was the best-performing candidate out of the two, winning 10% of the vote in Belfast East, and the only one to retain their deposit. 

The party held four of the seven seats they were defending at the concurrent local elections, but did make a gain in Castlereagh. 

===Ervine leadership===
====2003 Assembly election====
The PUP put up candidates for the 2003 Assembly election, including both Assembly members and Smyth. 

Overall, their vote dropped by 1.2% to 8,032 votes, a large decline when compared to their success of over 20,000 votes in 1998.
Hutchinson lost his seat, while Ervine held his. 
With no other candidates elected, this left Ervine as the PUP&#x27;s only representative in the Assembly. 

====2005 local elections and subsequent activity====
The party had a poor showing at the 2005 local elections, losing half of their seats. This left Ervine and Smyth in Belfast as the only PUP candidates to be returned. 

Following a loyalist feud between the UVF and Loyalist Volunteer Force, in which four men were murdered by the UVF in Belfast and recognition of the UVF&#x27;s ceasefire was withdrawn by the British government, the PUP debated ending its &quot;special relationship&quot; with the UVF. This was defeated in a closed vote at the party&#x27;s annual conference in October 2005.

In March 2006, the Chairwoman of the PUP, Dawn Purvis, a research associate at the University of Ulster, was appointed as an independent member of the Northern Ireland Policing Board.
===Death of David Ervine and Purvis leadership===
David Ervine died following a heart attack on 8 January 2007. On 22 January 2007 Dawn Purvis was chosen as party leader. She is the second woman to lead a unionist party in Northern Ireland (after Anne Dickson&#x27;s short-lived leadership of the Unionist Party of Northern Ireland following Brian Faulkner&#x27;s retirement). Dr John Kyle was co-opted on to Belfast City Council to fill Ervine&#x27;s seat. 

====2007 Assembly election ====
The PUP fielded three candidates for the 2007 Assembly election: Elaine Martin in North Down, Andrew Park in Belfast South and Dawn Purvis in Belfast East. Overall the party polled 3,822 votes or 0.6% of the votes cast in Northern Ireland, down 0.6% from the elections of 2003.

Purvis retained her party&#x27;s seat in Belfast East, while no other PUP candidates were elected. 
====2010 resignations and relationship with UVF/RHC====
The party did not field any candidates for the 2010 general elections - party members were encouraged to vote for a candidate of their choice.

In June 2010, Dawn Purvis resigned as leader, and as a member, of the party because of its relationship with the UVF and a recent murder attributed to that group. John Kyle was subsequently appointed interim leader, following Purvis&#x27;s resignation. On 28 August 2010 the former deputy leader, David Rose, resigned from the party. He cited the recent murder attributed to the UVF and his belief that the party was &quot;becoming increasingly conservative in outlook.

During a meeting in Belfast on 29 September 2010, members of the party agreed to maintain its relationship with the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Red Hand Commando.
Despite the links with the UVF, Billy Hutchinson acknowledges that most UVF members vote for the larger Democratic Unionist Party.

===2011 local and Assembly elections and Brian Ervine&#x27;s leadership===
Brian Ervine was appointed PUP leader in October 2010.

At their manifesto launch for the 2011 Assembly and local elections, the PUP revealed their manifesto pledges, including: a balanced economy, greater integrated education and building a full-size replica of the RMS Titanic to be docked in Belfast Harbour.
Additionally, Ervine announced that he would be standing in Belfast East, and that the party would be running local candidates in Larne, Castlereagh and Derry as well as in Belfast and Antrim.

No PUP candidates were elected to the Assembly, leaving the party without representation for the first time since 1998. Ervine himself finished behind Purvis who had run for re-election as an independent. She, too, was not elected.

Despite losing their Assembly seat, the PUP did return their two councillors in Belfast. 
A month after the elections, Ervine announced his resignation as party leader, and later was replaced by veteran west Belfast activist Billy Hutchinson in October 2011.

===Hutchinson leadership===
Hutchinson succeeded Hugh Smyth on Belfast City Council in January 2014, following the latter&#x27;s retirement due to ill health. 
====2014 local elections====
The PUP stood candidates for the new &#x27;super councils&#x27; at the 2014 local elections, doubling their total number of representatives from two to four.

In Belfast, deputy leader John Kyle was re-elected, this time for the Titanic district, while Hutchinson topped the poll in Court. The party were also joined on the council by Julie Anne Corr-Johnston, who regained a seat in Oldpark for the party.

On the Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, Coleraine candidate, Russell Watton, was the first to be elected in that district.

Smyth died during the election campaign.

====2016 and 2017 Assembly elections====
The PUP stood six candidates at the 2016 Assembly election, but, despite an increase in their overall vote, no candidates were elected.

Their support dipped slightly at the snap election in 2017, but did see an increase in their votes in North and East Belfast.

====2019 local elections====
The party stood candidates at the 2019 local elections, including all four of their incumbent councillors. No further gains were made, with the party only losing their seat in Oldpark.

====The Northern Ireland Protocol====
Following the United Kingdom&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union, the PUP have been protesting against the Northern Ireland Protocol, part of the arrangements to prevent a &#x27;hard border&#x27; in the Irish Sea. The party believes that the Protocol inhibits the Principle of consent, leading to Hutchinson saying that the PUP no longer support the Good Friday Agreement in November 2021. 

Conversely, in an interview on BBC&#x27;s The View programme, John Kyle stated that the Protocol could have &quot;significant advantages&quot; if &quot;fundamental&quot; changes are made. Kyle&#x27;s remarks sparked outrage among unionists, with the PUP releasing a statement clarifying that the party still remains opposed to the Protocol, and that Kyle was giving a personal view.

Kyle subsequently resigned as both deputy leader and a member of the party three weeks later, citing &quot;differing approaches&quot; in regard to the Protocol.

====2022 Assembly election====
The party stood only three candidates at the 2022 Assembly election, with Hutchinson standing in North Belfast, Russell Watton in East Londonderry and Karl Bennett in East Belfast.

No candidates were elected, with the PUP seeing a 52% drop in their support, compared to 2017.

====2023 local elections====
The PUP had four candidates at the May local elections, with one candidate each across Belfast, Causeway Coast and Glens, Antrim and Newtownabbey and Mid and East Antrim.

The party polled 2,103 votes (0.3%) overall, and were wiped out in Belfast, with Hutchinson losing out to the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV).

In the Causeway Coast and Glens, Watton retained his seat, making him the sole PUP candidate to be elected.

A month after the elections, Hutchinson resigned as leader, with Watton taking over the role.

==Notable members==
Former UVF member Billy Giles, who spent 14 years in the Maze Prison for a sectarian killing, was part of the PUP&#x27;s negotiating team at the Good Friday Agreement in April 1998. Others involved in this process included Billy Mitchell, David Ervine, Jim McDonald, William &#x27;Billy&#x27; Greer, Winston Churchill Rea and William &quot;Plum&quot; Smyth; all former UVF and Red Hand Commando members.

<doc id="362515" wikidata="Q239394" url="?curid=362515" title="Édouard Vuillard">
<text>Jean-Édouard Vuillard (; 11 November 186821 June 1940) was a French painter, decorative artist, and printmaker. From 1891 through 1900, Vuillard was a member of the avant garde artistic group Les Nabis, creating paintings that assembled areas of pure color. His interior scenes, influenced by Japanese prints, explored the spatial effects of flattened planes of color, pattern, and form. As a decorative artist, Vuillard painted theater sets, panels for interior decoration, and designed plates and stained glass. After 1900, when the Nabis broke up, Vuillard adopted a more realistic style, approaching landscapes and interiors with greater detail and vivid colors. In the 1920s and 1930s, he painted portraits of figures in French industry and the arts in their familiar settings.

Vuillard was influenced by Paul Gauguin, among other post-impressionist painters.

== Early life ==
Jean-Édouard Vuillard was born on 11 November 1868 in Cuiseaux (Saône-et-Loire), where he spent his youth. Vuillard&#x27;s father was a retired naval captain who became a tax collector after leaving the military. His father was 27 years older than his mother, Marie Vuillard (née Michaud), who was a seamstress.

After his father&#x27;s retirement in 1877, the family settled in Paris at 18 Rue de Chabrol, then moved to a building on Rue Daunou where his mother had a sewing workshop. Vuillard entered a school run by the Marist Brothers. He was awarded a scholarship to attend the prestigious Lycée Fontaine, which in 1883 became the Lycée Condorcet. Vuillard studied rhetoric and art, making drawings of works by Michelangelo and classical sculptures. At the Lycée he met several of the future Nabis, including Ker-Xavier Roussel (Vuillard&#x27;s future brother in law), Maurice Denis, writer Pierre Véber, and the future actor and theater director Aurélien Lugné-Poe.

In November 1885, when Vuillard left the Lycée, he gave up his original idea of following his father in a military career, and set out to become an artist. He joined Roussel at the studio of painter Diogène Maillart, in the former studio of Eugène Delacroix on Place Fürstenberg. There, Roussel and Vuillard learned the rudiments of painting. In 1885, Vuillard took courses at the Académie Julian, and frequented the studios of the academic painters William-Adolphe Bouguereau and Robert-Fleury. However, he failed in the competitions to enter the École des Beaux-Arts in February and July 1886 and again in February 1887. In July 1887, the persistent Vuillard was accepted, and was placed in the course of Robert-Fleury, then in 1888 with the academic history painter Jean-Léon Gérôme. In 1888 and 1889, he pursued his studies in academic art. He painted a self-portrait with his friend Waroquoy, and had a crayon portrait of his grandmother accepted for the Salon of 1889. At the end of that academic year, and after a brief period of military service, he set out to become an artist.

==Les Nabis==

Late in 1889, Vuillard began to frequent meetings of the informal group of artists known as Les Nabis, or &quot;The prophets&quot;, a semi-secret, semi-mystical club that included Maurice Denis and some of his other friends from the Lycée. In 1888, the young painter Paul Sérusier had traveled to Brittany, where, under the direction of Paul Gauguin, he had made a nearly abstract painting of the seaport, composed of areas of color. This composition, &quot;The Talisman&quot;, became the first Nabi painting. Serusier and his friend Pierre Bonnard, Maurice Denis and Paul Ranson, were among the first &quot;Nabis&quot; of &quot;nabiim&quot;, dedicated to transforming art down to its foundations. In 1890, through Denis, Vuillard became a member of the group, which met in Ransom&#x27;s studio or in the cafes of the Passage Brady. The existence of the organization was in theory secret, and members used coded nicknames; Vuillard became the &quot;Nabi Zouave&quot;, because of his military service.

Vuillard first worked on theater decoration. He shared a studio at 28 Rue Pigalle with Bonnard with the theater impresario Lugné-Poe, and the theater critic Georges Rousel. There, Vuillard designed sets for several works by Maeterlinck and other symbolist writers. In 1891, he took part in his first exposition with the Nabis at the Chateau of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. He showed two paintings, including &quot;The Woman in a Striped Dress&quot;. The reviews were largely good, but the critic of &quot;Le Chat Noir&quot; wrote of &quot;Works still indecisive, where one finds the features in style, literary shadows, sometimes a tender harmony.&quot; (19 September 1891).

Vuillard began keeping a journal during this time, which records the formation of his artistic philosophy. &quot;We perceive nature through the senses which give us images of forms, sounds, colors, etc.&quot; he wrote on 22 November 1888, shortly before he became a Nabi. &quot;A form or a color exists only in relation to another. Form does not exist on its own. We can only conceive of the relations.&quot; In 1890 he returned to the same idea: &quot;Let&#x27;s look at a painting as a set of relations that are definitely detached from any idea of naturalism.&quot; 
===The Japanese influence===
The works of Vuillard and the Nabis were strongly influenced by Japanese woodblock prints, which were shown in Paris at the gallery of art dealer Siegfried Bing, and at a large show at the École des Beaux Arts in 1890. Vuillard himself acquired a personal collection of 180 prints, some of which are visible in the backgrounds of his paintings. The Japanese influence appeared particularly in his work in the negation of depth, the simplicity of forms, and strongly contrasting colors. The faces were often turned away, and drawn with just a few lines. There was no attempt to create perspective. Vegetal, floral and geometric designs in the wallpaper or clothing were more important than the faces. In some of Vuillard&#x27;s works, the persons in the paintings almost entirely disappeared into the designs of the wallpaper. The Japanese influence continued in his later, post-Nabi works, particularly in the painted screens depicting Place Vintimille he made for Marguerite Chaplin.

===Decoration===
Vuillard, like other members of the Nabis, believed that decorative art was equal to traditional easel painting. Vuillard created theatrical sets and programs, decorative murals and painted screens, prints, designs for stained glass windows, and ceramic plates. In the early 1890s, he worked especially for the Théâtre de l&#x27;Œuvre of Lugné-Poe designing backdrops and programs.

From theater decoration, Vuillard soon moved into interior decoration. In the course of his theater work, he met brothers Alexandre and Thadée Natanson, the founders of &quot; La Revue Blanche&quot;, a cultural review. Vuillard&#x27;s graphics appeared in the journal, together with Pierre Bonnard, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Félix Vallotton and others. In 1892, on a commission for Natanson brothers, Vuillard painted his first decorations (&quot;apartment frescoes&quot;) for the house of Mme Desmarais. He made others in 1894 for Alexandre Natanson, and in 1898 for Claude Anet.

Vuillard used some of the same techniques he had used in the theater for making scenery, such as &quot;&quot;, or distemper, which allowed him to make large panels more quickly. This method, originally used in Renaissance frescoes, involved using rabbit-skin glue as a binder mixed with chalk and white pigment to make gesso, a smooth coating applied to wood panels or canvas, on which the painting was made. This allowed the painter to achieve finer detail and color than on canvas, and was waterproof. In 1892, Vuillard received his first decorative commission to make six paintings to be placed above the doorways of the salon of the family of Paul Desmarais. He designed his panels and murals to fit into the architectural setting and the interests of the client.

In 1894, Vuillard and the other Nabis received a commission from art gallery owner Siegfried Bing, who had given &quot;Art Nouveau&quot; its name, to design stained glass windows to be made by the American firm of Louis Tiffany. Their designs were displayed in 1895 at the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, but the actual windows were never made. In 1895, he designed a series of decorative porcelain plates, decorated with faces and figures of women in modern dress, immersed in floral designs. The plates, along with his design for the Tiffany window and the decorative panels made for the Natansons, were displayed at the opening of Bing&#x27;s gallery &quot;Maison de l&#x27;Art Nouveau&quot; in December 1895.
===&quot;The Public Gardens&quot;===
Some of Vuillard&#x27;s best-known works, including &quot;Les Jardins Publiques&quot; (&quot;The Public Gardens&quot;) and &quot;Figures dans un Interieur&quot; (Figures in an Interior) were made for the Natanson brothers, whom he had known at the Lycée Condorcet, and for their friends. They gave Vuillard freedom to choose the subjects and style. Between 1892 and 1899, Vuillard made eight cycles of decorative paintings, with altogether some thirty panels. The murals, though rarely displayed during his lifetime, later became among his most famous works.

&quot;The Public Gardens&quot; is a series of six panels depicting children in the parks of Paris. The patrons, Alexander Natanson and his wife Olga, had three young daughters. The paintings show a variety of different inspirations, including the medieval tapestries at the Hotel de Cluny in Paris that Vuillard greatly appreciated. For this series Vuillard did not use oil paint, but &quot;&quot;, a method he had used in painting theater sets, which required him to work very quickly, but allowed him to make modifications and to achieve the appearance of frescoes. He received the commission on 24 August 1894, and completed the series at the end of the same year. They were installed in the dining room/salon of the Natansons. 
===&quot;Interior scenes&quot;===
Vuillard frequently painted interior scenes, usually of women in a workplace, at home, or in a garden. The faces and features of the figures in these scenes are rarely articulated in detail; instead Vuillard often places greater focus on the patterns and planes of wallpaper, carpets, and furnishings.

Vuillard wrote in his journal in 1890, &quot;In the decoration of an apartment, and overly-precise subject can easily become intolerable. One might less quickly get tired of a textile, or drawings without too much literal precision.&quot; He also preferred to populate his interiors with women. As he wrote in his journal in 1894, &quot;When my attention is directed toward men, I see only gross caricatures... I never feel so with women, where I always find the means to isolate a few elements which satisfy me as a painter. It&#x27;s not that men are uglier than women, they&#x27;re only so in my imagination.&quot;

Vuillard painted a series of paintings of seamstresses in the workshop of a dressmaker, based on the workshop of his mother. In &quot;La Robe à Ramages&quot; (&quot;The Flowered Dress&quot;; 1891), the women in the workshop are assembled out of areas of color. The faces, seen from the side, have no details. The patterns of their costumes and the decor dominate the pictures. The figures include his grandmother, to the left, and his sister Marie, in the bold patterned dress that is a central feature of the painting. He also placed a mirror on the wall to the left, a device which allowed him to give two points of view simultaneously and to reflect and distort the scene. The result is a work that is deliberately flattened and decorative.

&quot;Seamstress&quot; &quot;with Chiffons&quot; (1893) also presents a seamstress at work, seated in front of a window. Her face is obscure and the image appears almost flat, dominated by the floral patterns of the wall.

In 1895, Vuillard received a commission from the cardiologist Henri Vaquez for four panels to decorate the library of his Paris house at 27 rue du Général Foy. The primary subjects were women engaged in playing the piano, sewing, and other solitary occupations in a highly decorated bourgeois apartment. The one man in the series, presumably Vaquez himself, is shown in his library reading, paying little attention to the woman sewing next to him. The figures in the panels are almost entirely integrated into the elaborate wallpaper, carpet, and patterns of the dresses of the women. Art critics immediately compared the works to medieval tapestries. The paintings, completed in 1896, were originally titled simply &quot;People in Interiors&quot; but later critics added subtitles: &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Work&quot;, &quot;The Choice of Books&quot;, and &quot;Intimacy.&quot; They are now in the Museum of the Petit Palais in Paris.

In 1897, Vuillard interiors showed a noticeable change, with &quot;Large Interior with Six Persons&quot;. The picture was much more complex in its perspective, depth and color, with carpets arranged in different angles, and the figures scattered around the room more recognizable. It was also complex in its subject matter. The setting appears to be the apartment of the Nabi painter Paul Ranson, reading a book; Madame Vuillard seated in an armchair, Ida Rousseau coming in the door, and her daughter Germaine Rousseau, standing at the left. The unstated subject was the romantic affair between Ker-Xavier Roussel and Germaine Rousseau, his sister-in-law, which shocked the Nabis.

==After the Nabis (1900–1914)==
The Nabis went their separate ways after their exposition in 1900. They had always had different styles, though they shared common ideas and ideals about art. The separation was made deeper by the Dreyfus Affair (1894–1908), which split French society. Dreyfus was a Jewish French army officer accused falsely of treason, and sentenced to a penal colony, before finally being exonerated. Among the Nabis, Vuillard and Pierre Bonnard supported Dreyfus, while Maurice Denis and Sérusier supported the side of the French army.

After the separation of the Nabis in 1900, Vuillard&#x27;s artistic style and subjects changed. He gradually abandoned the close, crowded and dark interiors he had painted before 1900, and began to paint more outdoors, with natural light. He continued to paint interiors, but the interiors had more light and color, more depth, and the faces and features were clearer. The effects of the light became primary components of his paintings, whether they were interior scenes or the parks and streets of Paris. Vuillard gradually returned to naturalism. He held his second large personal exhibition at the Gallerie Bernheim-Jeune in November 1908, where he presented many of his new landscapes. Vuillard was praised by one anti-modernist critic for &quot;his delicious protest against systematic deformations.&quot;

In 1912, Vuillard, Bonnard and Roussel were nominated for the Légion d&#x27;honneur, but all three refused the honor. &quot;I do not seek any other compensation for my efforts than the esteem of people with taste,&quot; Vuillard told a journalist.

In 1912, Vuillard painted &quot;Théodore Duret in his Study&quot;, a commissioned portrait that signaled a new phase in Vuillard&#x27;s work, which was dominated by portraiture from 1920 onwards.

Vuillard served as a juror with Florence Meyer Blumenthal in awarding the Prix Blumenthal, a grant given between 1919–1954 to young French painters, sculptors, decorators, engravers, writers, and musicians.

===New interiors, cityscapes and gardens===
After 1900, Vuillard continued to paint numerous domestic interiors and gardens, but in a more naturalistic, colorful style than he had used as a Nabi. Though the faces of the persons were still often looking away, the interiors had depth, a richness of detail, and warmer colors. He particularly captured the play of the sunlight on the gardens and his subjects. He did not want to return to the past, but wanted to move into the future with a vision that was more decorative, naturalistic and familiar than that of the modernists.

He made new series of decorative panels, depicting urban scenes and parks in Paris, as well as many interior scenes of Paris shops and homes. He depicted the galleries of the Louvre Museum and the Museum of Decorative Arts, the chapel of the Palace of Versailles.
===Theater===
The theater was an important part of Vuillard&#x27;s life. He had started his artistic career making sets and designing programs for an avant-garde theater, and throughout his life, had close contacts with the professional world of the theater. Vuillard painted his friend, the actor and director Sacha Guitry. 
In May 1912, Vuillard received an important commission for seven panels, and three paintings above the doorways, for the new Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris, including one of Guitry in his loge at the theater, and another of the comic playwright Georges Feydeau. He attended the performances of the Ballets Russes between 1911 and 1914, and dined with the Russian director of the Ballet, Sergei Diaghilev, and with the American dancer Isadora Duncan, and frequented the Folies Bergère and the Moulin Rouge in their heyday. In 1937 he and Bonnard combined their impressions of the history of Paris theater world in a large mural, &quot;La Comédie&quot;, for the foyer of the new Théâtre national de Chaillot, built for the 1937 Paris International Exposition.

==Final years (1914–1940)==

Following the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Vuillard was briefly mobilized for military duty as a highway guard. He was soon released from this duty, and returned to painting. He visited the armaments factory of his patron, Thadée Natanson, near Lyon, and later made a series of three paintings of the factories at work. He served briefly, from 2 to 22 February, as an official artist to the French armies in the region of the Vosges, making a series of pastels. These included a sympathetic sketch of a captured German prisoner being interrogated. In August 1917, back in Paris, he received a commission from the architect Francis Jourdain for a mural for a fashionable Paris café, Le Grand Teddy.

In 1921, Vuillard received an important commission for decorative panels for the art patron Camille Bauer, for his residence in Basel, Switzerland. Vuillard completed a series of four panels, plus two over-the-door paintings, which were finished by 1922. He passed his summers each year from 1917 to 1924 at Vaucresson, at a house he rented with his mother. He also made a series of landscape paintings of the area.

===Portraits===
After 1920, Vuillard was increasingly occupied painting portraits for wealthy and distinguished Parisians. He preferred to use the technique of &quot;&quot;, or distemper technique, which allowed him to create more precise details and richer color effects. His subjects ranged from the actor and director Sacha Guitry to the fashion designer Jeanne Lanvin, Lanvin&#x27;s daughter, the Contesse Marie-Blanche de Polignac, the inventor and aviation pioneer Marcel Kapferer, and the actress Jane Renouardt. He usually presented his subjects in their studios or homes or backstage, with lavishly detailed backgrounds, wallpaper, furnishings and carpets. The backgrounds both created a mood, told a story, and served as a contrast to bring out the main figure.
===Recognition and death===
Between 1930 and 1935, Vuillard divided his time between Paris and the Château de Clayes, owned by his friend Hessel. Vuillard did not receive official recognition from the French state until July 1936, when he was commissioned to make a mural, &quot;La Comédie&quot;, depicting his impressions of the history of the Paris theater world for the foyer of the new Théâtre national de Chaillot, built for the 1937 Paris International Exposition. In August of the same year, the city of Paris bought four of Vuillard&#x27;s paintings, &quot;Anabaptistes&quot;, and a collection of sketches. In 1937, Vuillard received another major commission, along with Maurice Denis and Roussel, for a monumental mural at the Palace of the League of Nations in Geneva.

In 1938, Vuillard was elected to the Académie des Beaux Arts in February, and in July, the Musée des Arts Decoratifs presented a major retrospective of his paintings. Later in the year, he traveled to Geneva to oversee the installation of his mural &quot;Peace, Protector of the Arts&quot; at the League of Nations Building.

In 1940, Vuillard completed his last two portraits. He suffered from pulmonary difficulties and traveled to La Baule in Loire-Atlantique to restore his health. He died there on 21 June 1940, the same month that the French army was defeated by the Germans in the Battle of France.

==Personal life==
Vuillard was unmarried, but his personal life and his work were greatly influenced by his women friends. In the late 1890s he began a long relationship with Misia Natanson, the wife of his important patron, Thadée Natanson. Natanson had married her in April 1893, when she was sixteen years old. She appears in the &quot;Public Gardens&quot;. He helped her decorate the Natansons&#x27; apartment, painted her often in his decorative panels, and regularly accompanied her and her husband to their country house.

In 1900, Vuillard met Lucy Hessel, wife of a Swiss art dealer, who became his new muse, traveling with him each year to Normandy in July, August and September, and giving him advice. She remained with him, despite many rivals and many dramatic scenes, until the end of his life. In addition to Misia and Lucy, he also had a long relationship with the actress Lucie Belin, for whom he arranged a pension when she fell ill in the 1920s. 
== &quot;Le Grand Teddy&quot; painting rediscovery ==

In 2014, the BBC television program &quot;Fake or Fortune?&quot; investigated a painting owned by British scriptwriter Keith Tutt, which both he and the previous owners, Mr. and Mrs. Warren, believed to be by Vuillard. The oval painting, which depicts a café scene, was thought to be one of a group of three paintings commissioned from Vuillard in 1918 to decorate a new Parisian café, &quot;Le Grand Teddy&quot;, named after American president Teddy Roosevelt. The main painting of the commission, a large horizontal oval work depicting a busy café interior (currently privately owned and kept in secure storage in Geneva, Switzerland) was at the time the only one of the three known to still exist and to have been fully confirmed as a genuine Vuillard. With assistance from art experts, the program undertook an exhaustive investigation and analysis of the Tutt painting, as well as carrying out extensive research to establish the painting&#x27;s provenance. After submitting all the evidence to a committee at the secretive and highly conservative Wildenstein Institute in Paris, Tutt and the &quot;Fake or Fortune?&quot; team learned that the committee had unanimously agreed it was genuine.

== Market ==
On 13 November 2017, &quot;Misia et Vallotton à Villeneuve&quot; painted in 1899 became the most valuable Vuillard sold at auction when it achieved $17.75 million at Christie&#x27;s. The painting had been owned by Nancy Lee and Perry Bass since 1979 when they bought the painting from Wildenstein &amp; Co., the French art dealing family.

== Nazi-looted art ==
In 2006, the National Gallery of Canada restituted Vuillard&#x27;s &quot;The Salon of Madame Aron&quot; (1904, reworked in 1934), which it had purchased in 1956, to the Lindon family in France.

<text>Józef Marcinkiewicz (; 30 March 1910 in Cimoszka, near Białystok, Poland – 1940 in Kharkiv, USSR) was a Polish mathematician.

==Life and career==
He was a student of Antoni Zygmund; and later worked with Juliusz Schauder, Stefan Kaczmarz and Raphaël Salem. He was a professor of the Stefan Batory University in Wilno.

He enlisted in the Polish Army during the German invasion of Poland. In the aftermath of the simultaneous Soviet invasion of Poland, Marcinkiewicz was taken as a Polish POW to a Soviet camp in Starobielsk. The exact place and date of his death remain unknown, but it is believed that he died, when aged 30, murdered by the NKVD in Kharkiv. His parents, to whom he gave his manuscripts before the beginning of World War II, were transported to the Soviet Union in 1940 and later died of hunger in a camp.

Their fate is described by Zygmund described the last and his lost mathematical works as follows:

War broke out a few days after Marcinkiewicz returned to Wilno. Zygmund writes On 2 September, the second day of the war, I came across him accidentally in the street in Wilno, already in military uniform ... We agreed to meet the same day in the evening but apparently circumstances prevented him from coming since he did not show up at the appointed place. A few months later came the news that he was a prisoner of war and was asking for mathematical books. It seems that this was the last news about Marcinkiewicz. During his time in Paris and England, Marcinkiewicz had produced some mathematical work which he had written down in manuscript form. After returning to Poland he gave these manuscripts to his parents for safe keeping. Sadly Marcinkiewicz&#x27;s parents suffered the same fate as he did and died during the war. No trace of the manuscripts was ever found.

<text>Abner Haynes (September 19, 1937 – July 18, 2024) was an American professional football player who was a halfback and return specialist in the American Football League (AFL). He played college football for the North Texas State Eagles and was selected by the Oakland Raiders in the 1960 AFL draft. He was also chosen by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the fifth round of the 1960 NFL draft.

==Early life and integration==
Born in Denton, Texas, Haynes graduated from Lincoln High School in Dallas in 1956. He played college football at North Texas State College in Denton (now the University of North Texas), where he and teammate Leon King integrated college football in the state of Texas in 1957.

==Professional career==

Although selected in the fifth round (55th overall) of the 1960 NFL draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers, Haynes chose to play for the AFL&#x27;s Dallas Texans, signing his contract with the team under the goal posts of Kidd Field after the 1959 Sun Bowl. Haynes led the AFL in rushing attempts, yards, and TDs in its first year. Haynes&#x27; father, a minister, advised that the young man play in the AFL after coach Buddy Parker and quarterback Bobby Layne of the Steelers made a drunken visit to Haynes&#x27; house.

Haynes helped popularize the AFL in 1960, when he was the fledgling league&#x27;s first Player of the Year, and its first Rookie of the Year. He captured the AFL&#x27;s first rushing crown with 875 yards, and also led the Texans in receiving, punt returns, and kickoff returns. Haynes spent three years in Dallas and two with same franchise when it became the Kansas City Chiefs in 1963. The Chiefs and the North Texas Eagles both retired his number 28 in honor of his many achievements.

&quot;He was a franchise player before they talked about franchise players&quot;, praised Stram. &quot;He did it all – rushing, receiving, kickoff returns, punt returns. He gave us the dimension we needed to be a good team in Dallas.&quot; The , Haynes, who had great speed and dazzling moves in the open field, was regularly among the AFL&#x27;s top 10 rushers (3rd all-time), and set AFL records with 5 touchdowns in a game, 19 in a season in 1961, and 46 in his career. Haynes still owns 10 Texans franchise records, including most points in a game (30), most touchdowns in a game (5), and most career combined yards (8,442). He was Hall of Fame head coach Hank Stram&#x27;s most versatile and dangerous weapon from 1960 to 1962, amassing 43 touchdowns and 4,472 yards on rushes and receptions. In 1962, he helped the Texans win the AFL championship game in the classic double-overtime victory over the two-time defending champion Houston Oilers. At the time it was the longest professional football championship game ever played. In that game, Haynes scored touchdowns on a 28-yard pass reception from quarterback Len Dawson, and on a 2-yard run.

Another notable game for Haynes was in 1962 on September 30 against the Buffalo Bills at the Cotton Bowl; he ran for 164 yards on just 16 attempts (10+ yards per carry), with two touchdown runs, one of 71 yards and one of 13 yards, in the Texans&#x27; 41–21 victory.

Haynes was then traded to the Denver Broncos prior to the 1965 season. Haynes believed that the trade was retribution for his participation in several black players boycotting the 1965 American Football League All-Star game, which was supposed to be in New Orleans, due to the black players&#x27; mistreatment by hotels and businesses in New Orleans. The game was quickly moved to Houston after the players&#x27; protests. According to Haynes, he received a letter from the Chiefs&#x27; organization reprimanding him for his actions, and he was soon traded after. In 1965, he scored three rushing touchdowns, two receiving touchdowns, and returned one punt for a touchdown. He also led the league in kick returns (34), kick return yards (901), kick return average (26.5), and was fourth in the league in all-purpose yards (1,404). On Oct 17, he returned 3 kicks 140 yards for a franchise record 46.7 average. In 1966, he had 304 yards rushing and 480 receiving, but led the league with 11 fumbles and was let go. In 1967, he played for both the Miami Dolphins, and the New York Jets.

During his 8 professional seasons, Haynes carried the ball 1,036 times for 4,630 yards, a 4.5 average; caught 287 passes for 3,535 yards, a 12.3 average, and 20 touchdowns; returned 85 punts for 875 yards, a 10.3 average, and 1 touchdown; and ran back 121 kickoffs for 3,025 yards, a 25.0 average, and 1 touchdown. His 12,065 combined yards is the American Football League record. Haynes had three games in which he gained 100 or more yards on 14 or fewer carries, and was selected to the All-Time All-AFL second-team. He had a program called &quot;Heroes of Football&quot; which connects former professional players with their communities.

In 2019, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Haynes to the PFRA Hall of Very Good Class of 2019.

===&quot;We&#x27;ll Kick to the Clock&quot;===
In the 1962 AFL Championship Game, Haynes made what could have been a costly error at the start of overtime. Coach Stram, aware of the strong winds at Jeppesen Stadium, instructed Haynes, should the Texans win the coin toss, to choose the end of the field facing the stadium clock, which would give the Texans the wind at their backs. (In professional American football, the team winning the coin toss can choose either to elect whether to kickoff or receive the kickoff, or elect which goal to defend. If that team&#x27;s election is regarding the kickoff, the other team gets to elect which goal to defend; and vice versa.)

The Texans won the coin toss. Haynes, assuming that when the Texans elected which goal to defend, the Oilers would elect to receive the kickoff (thereby gaining first possession of the ball), told the referee, &quot;We&#x27;ll kick to the clock.&quot; However, by starting with the words &quot;We&#x27;ll kick&quot;, Haynes had made the election for the Texans to kick off, allowing the Oilers, not the Texans, to choose which goal to defend. The Texans saved Haynes from embarrassment by not allowing the Oilers to score in that first overtime, then won the game on Tommy Brooker&#x27;s field goal 2 minutes and 54 seconds into the second overtime (after the teams had switched ends).

When asked about his mistake following the game, Haynes said &quot;I knew we&#x27;d need the wind behind us in the sixth quarter.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Haynes was a cousin of Sly Stone, Rose Stone, and Freddie Stone of Sly and the Family Stone.

Haynes died in Dallas on July 18, 2024, at the age of 86.

<text>The Northern Ireland Unionist Party (NIUP) was a small unionist political party in Northern Ireland that campaigned against the Belfast Agreement.

==History==
It was formed in January 1999 as a splinter party from the UK Unionist Party (UKUP). This split was caused by disagreement between the five UKUP members of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Four of the members disagreed with UKUP leader Robert McCartney&#x27;s policy of resigning from the Assembly should Sinn Féin become part of the power-sharing executive. Cedric Wilson, Patrick Roche, Norman Boyd and Roger Hutchinson disagreed with McCartney, wanting to remain in the Assembly to challenge unionists in favour of the Belfast Agreement. McCartney disciplined these members in their absence and, in response, they left the UKUP and formed the NIUP. Led by Wilson, the new party argued that it had the support of the grassroots membership of the UKUP, but McCartney disputed this.

Subsequently, Hutchinson left the NIUP on 30 November 1999, sitting as an independent Unionist for a period before joining the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). He then left the DUP and unsuccessfully contested the 2003 Assembly Election as an independent Unionist.

The NIUP opposed the Belfast Agreement and the reformation of the Royal Ulster Constabulary to the Police Service Northern Ireland. They described their position as &quot;principled unionism.&quot;

In its first electoral test, the party polled very poorly in the 2001 General Election and in local elections held on the same day, winning no Westminster or council seats. In the 2003 Assembly Election, the NIUP won no seats at all.

The NIUP consistently had a low level of support and mainly contested the constituencies represented by its four Assembly members. In 2001, it received 1,794 votes in the general election and 1,818 votes in the local elections. This fell to 1,350 in the 2003 Assembly election. Its share of the vote across Northern Ireland was around 0.2% in each case.

The party&#x27;s submission of accounts for 2004 stated that the party was &quot;inactive&quot; during this period and there is no evidence of subsequent activity. Wilson stood as an independent candidate in the Strangford constituency at the 2007 Assembly Election where he polled 305 votes (0.8%), thus finishing last out of the fifteen candidates.

The NIUP voluntarily deregistered as a political party on 10 March 2008.

<doc id="362530" wikidata="Q26408" url="?curid=362530" title="Pierre Bonnard">
<text>Pierre Bonnard (; 3 October 186723 January 1947) was a French painter, illustrator and printmaker, known especially for the stylized decorative qualities of his paintings and his bold use of color. A founding member of the Post-Impressionist group of avant-garde painters Les Nabis, his early work was strongly influenced by the work of Paul Gauguin, as well as the prints of Hokusai and other Japanese artists. Bonnard was a leading figure in the transition from Impressionism to Modernism. He painted landscapes, urban scenes, portraits and intimate domestic scenes, where the backgrounds, colors and painting style usually took precedence over the subject.

==Early life and education==

Pierre Bonnard was born in Fontenay-aux-Roses, Hauts-de-Seine on 3 October 1867. His mother, Élisabeth Mertzdorff, was from Alsace. His father, Eugène Bonnard, was from the Dauphiné, and was a senior official in the French Ministry of War. He had a brother, Charles, and a sister, Andrée, who in 1890 married the composer Claude Terrasse.

He received his education in the Lycée Louis-le-Grand and Lycée Charlemagne in Vanves. He showed a talent for drawing and water colors, as well as caricatures. He painted frequently in the gardens of his parents&#x27; country home at Le Grand-Lemps near La Côte-Saint-André in the Dauphiné. He also showed a strong interest in literature. He received his baccalaureate in the classics, and, to satisfy his father, between 1886 and 1887 earned his license in law, and began practicing as a lawyer in 1888.

While he was studying law, he attended art classes at the Académie Julian in Paris. At the Académie Julian he met his future friends and fellow artists, Paul Sérusier, Maurice Denis, Gabriel Ibels and Paul Ranson.

In 1888, Bonnard was accepted by the École des Beaux-Arts, where he met Édouard Vuillard and Ker Xavier Roussel. He also sold his first commercial work of art, a design for a poster for France-Champagne, which helped him convince his family that he could make a living as an artist. His first studio was on the rue Lechapelais.

In 1889–1890, Bonnard performed military service as a &quot;soldat de deuxième classe&quot; in the 52nd Infantry Regiment. After leaving the Army, Bonnard did not return to the Law, but rather to art, becoming an artist.

==Personal life==

From 1893 until her death, Bonnard lived with Marthe de Méligny (1869–1942), and she was the model for many of his paintings, including many nudes. Her birth name was Maria Boursin, but she had changed it before she met Bonnard. They married in 1925. In the years before their marriage, Bonnard had love affairs with two other women, who also served as models for some of his paintings: Renée Monchaty (the partner of the American painter Harry Lachmann) and Lucienne Dupuy de Frenelle, the wife of a doctor. It has been suggested that Bonnard may have been the father of Lucienne&#x27;s second son. Renée Monchaty committed suicide shortly after Bonnard and de Méligny married.

==Early career – the Nabis==
Bonnard received pressure from a different direction to continue painting. While he had received his license to practice law in 1888, he failed in the examination for entering the official registry of lawyers. Art was his only option. After the summer holidays, he joined with his friends from the Academy Julian to form Les Nabis, an informal group of artists with different styles and philosophies but common artistic ambitions. As he later wrote, Bonnard was entirely unaware of the Impressionist painters, or of Gauguin and other new painters. His friend Paul Sérusier showed him a painting on a wooden cigar box he made after visiting Paul Gauguin at Pont-Aven, using patches of pure color in the style of Gauguin. In 1890, Maurice Denis, at age twenty, formalized the doctrine in which a painting was considered &quot;a surface plane covered with colors assembled in a certain order.&quot;

Some of the Nabis had highly religious, philosophical or mystical approaches to their paintings, but Bonnard remained more cheerful and unaffiliated. The painter-writer Aurelien Lugné-Poe, who shared a studio at 28 rue Pigalle with Bonnard and Vuillard, wrote later, &quot;Pierre Bonnard was the humorist among us; his nonchalant gaiety, and humor expressed in his productions, of which the decorative spirit always preserved a sort of satire, from which he later departed.&quot;

In 1891, he met Toulouse-Lautrec and, in December 1891, showed his work at the annual exhibition of the Société des Artistes Indépendants. In the same year, Bonnard also began an association with &quot;La Revue Blanche&quot;, for which he and Édouard Vuillard designed a frontispiece. In March 1891, his work was displayed with the work of the other Nabis at the Le Barc de Boutteville.

The style of Japanese graphic arts became an important influence on Bonnard. In 1893, a major exposition of works of Utamaro and Hiroshige was held at the Durand-Ruel Gallery, and the Japanese influence, particularly the use of multiple points of view, and the use of bold geometric patterns in clothing, such as checkered blouses, began to appear in his work. Because of his passion for Japanese art, his nickname among the Nabis became &quot;Le Nabi le trés japonard.&quot;

He devoted an increasing amount of attention to decorative art, designing furniture, fabrics, fans and other objects. He continued to design posters for France-Champagne, which gained him an audience outside the art world. In 1892, he began creating lithographs, and painted &quot;Le Corsage a carreaux&quot; and &quot;La Partie de croquet&quot;. He also made a series of illustrations for the music books of his brother-in-law, Claude Terrasse.

In 1894, he turned in a new direction and made a series of paintings of scenes of the life of Paris. In his urban scenes, the buildings and even animals were the focus of attention; faces were rarely visible. He also made his first portrait of his future wife, Marthe, whom he married in 1925. In 1895, he became an early participant of the movement of Art Nouveau, designing a stained glass window, called &quot;Maternity&quot;, for Tiffany.

In 1895, he had his first individual exposition of paintings, posters and lithographs at the Durand-Ruel Gallery. He also illustrated a novel, &quot;Marie&quot;, by Peter Nansen, published in series by in &quot;La Revue Blanche&quot;. The following year he participated in a group exposition of Nabis at the Amboise Vollard Gallery. In 1899, he took part in another major exposition of works of the Nabis.

==Later years (1900–1938)==
Throughout the early 20th century, as new artistic movements emerged, Bonnard kept refining and revising his personal style, and exploring new subjects and media, but keeping constant the characteristics of his work. Working in his studio at 65 rue de Douai in Paris, he presented paintings at the Salon des Independents in 1900, and also produced 109 lithographs for &quot;Parallèment&quot;, a book of poems by Paul Verlaine. He also took part in an exhibition with the other Nabis at the Bernheim Jeaune gallery. He presented nine paintings at the Salon des Independents in 1901. In 1905, he produced a series of nudes and of portraits, and in 1906 had a personal exposition at the Bernheim-Jeune Gallery. In 1908, he illustrated a book of poetry by Octave Mirbeau, and made his first long stay in the South of France, at the home of the painter Manguin in Saint-Tropez. in 1909 and, in 1911, began a series of decorative panels, called &quot;Méditerranée&quot;, for the Russian art patron Ivan Morozov.

During the years of the First World War, Bonnard concentrated on nudes and portraits, and in 1916 completed a series of large compositions, including &quot;La Pastorale&quot;, &quot;Méditterranée&quot;, &quot;La Paradis Terreste&quot; and &quot;Paysage de Ville&quot;. His reputation in the French art establishment was secure; in 1918 he was selected, along with Renoir, as an honorary President of the Association of Young French Artists.

In the 1920s, he produced illustrations for a book by Andre Gide (1924) and another by Claude Anet (1923). He showed works at the Autumn Salon in 1923, and in 1924 was honored with a retrospective of sixty-eight of his works at the Galerie Druet. In 1925, he purchased a villa in Cannes.

==Final years and death (1939–1947)==
In 1938, Bonnard and Vuillard&#x27;s works were featured at an exposition at the Art Institute of Chicago. The outbreak of World War II in September 1939 forced Bonnard to depart Paris for the south of France, where he remained until the end of the war. Under the German occupation, he refused to paint an official portrait of French collaborationist leader Marechal Petain, but accepted a commission to paint a religious painting of Saint Francis de Sales, with the face of his friend Vuillard, who had died two years earlier.

In 1947 he finished his last painting, &quot;The Almond Tree in Blossom&quot;, a week before his death in his cottage on La Route de Serra Capeou near Le Cannet, on the French Riviera. The Museum of Modern Art in New York City organized a posthumous retrospective of Bonnard&#x27;s work in 1948, although originally it was meant to be a celebration of the artist&#x27;s 80th birthday.

==Japanism==
Japanese art played an important part in Bonnard&#x27;s work. He was first able to see the works of Japanese artists via the Paris gallery of Siegfried Bing. Bing brought works by Hokusai and other Japanese print makers to France, and from May 1888 through April 1891 published a monthly art journal, &quot;Le Japon Artistique&quot;, which included color illustrations in 1891. In 1890, Bing organized an important exhibition of seven hundred prints he had brought from Japan, and made a donation of Japanese art to the Louvre.

Bonnard used the model of Japanese &quot;kakemono&quot; scroll art—long, vertical panels—in his series of paintings &quot;Women in the garden&quot; (1890–91), now in the Museé d&#x27;Orsay. Originally designed to appear together as a single screen, Bonnard decided to display &quot;Women in the garden&quot; as four separate decorative panels. The female forms are reduced to flat silhouettes, and there is no rendering of depth in the picture. The faces are turned away from the viewer and the pictures are entirely dominated by the colors and bold patterns of the costumes and the backgrounds. The models are his sister Andreé and his cousin Berthe Schaedin. Bonnard often pictured women in checkered blouses, a design he said he had discovered in Japanese prints.

==Graphic arts==
Bonnard wrote, &quot;Notre génération a toujours cherché les rapports de l&#x27;art avec la vie&quot; (Our generation always was searching for connections between art and life). Bonnard and the other Nabis were particularly interested in integrating their art into popular forms, such as posters, journal covers and illustrations, and engravings in books, as well as into ordinary household decoration, in the form of murals, painted screens, textiles, tapestries, furniture, glass and dishes.

At the beginning of his career, Bonnard designed posters for a French champagne firm, for which he gained public attention. He later produced many sets of engravings illustrating the works of the avant-garde authors of his time.
==Method==

Bonnard is known for his intense use of color, especially via areas built with small brush marks and close values. His often complex compositions—typically of sunlit interiors and gardens populated with friends and family members—are both narrative and autobiographical. Bonnard&#x27;s fondness for depicting intimate scenes of everyday life, has led to him being called an &quot;Intimist&quot;; his wife Marthe was an ever-present subject over the course of several decades. She is seen seated at the kitchen table, with the remnants of a meal; or nude, as in a series of paintings where she reclines in the bathtub. He also painted several self-portraits, landscapes, street scenes, and many still lifes, which usually depicted flowers and fruit.

Bonnard did not paint from life but rather drew his subject—sometimes photographing it as well—and made notes on the colors. He then painted the canvas in his studio from his notes. &quot;I have all my subjects to hand,&quot; he said, &quot;I go back and look at them. I take notes. Then I go home. And before I start painting I reflect, I dream.&quot;

He worked on numerous canvases simultaneously, which he tacked onto the walls of his small studio. In this way, he could more freely determine the shape of a painting; &quot;It would bother me if my canvases were stretched onto a frame. I never know in advance what dimensions I am going to choose.&quot;

==Critical reception and legacy==

Claude Roger-Marx remarked that Bonnard &quot;catches fleeting poses, steals unconscious gestures, crystallises the most transient expressions&quot;.

Although Bonnard avoided public attention, his work sold well during his life. At the time of his death, his reputation had been eclipsed by subsequent avant-garde developments in the art world; reviewing a retrospective of Bonnard&#x27;s work in Paris in 1947, Christian Zervos assessed the artist in terms of his relationship to Impressionism, and found him wanting. &quot;In Bonnard&#x27;s work,&quot; he wrote, &quot;Impressionism becomes insipid and falls into decline.&quot; In response, Henri Matisse wrote: &quot;I maintain that Bonnard is a great artist for our time and, naturally, for posterity.&quot;

Bonnard was described, by his own friend and historians, as a man of &quot;quiet temperament&quot; and one who was unobtrusively independent. His life was relatively free from &quot;the tensions and reversals of untoward circumstance.&quot; It has been suggested that: &quot;Like Daumier, whose life knew little serenity, Bonnard produced a work during his sixty years&#x27; activity that follows an even line of development.&quot;

Bonnard has been described as &quot;the most thoroughly idiosyncratic of all the great twentieth-century painters&quot;, and the unusual vantage points of his compositions rely less on traditional modes of pictorial structure than voluptuous color, poetic allusions and visual wit. Identified as a late practitioner of Impressionism in the early 20thcentury, he has since been recognized for his unique use of color and his complex imagery. &quot;It&#x27;s not just the colors that radiate in a Bonnard,&quot; writes Roberta Smith, &quot;there&#x27;s also the heat of mixed emotions, rubbed into smoothness, shrouded in chromatic veils and intensified by unexpected spatial conundrums and by elusive, uneasy figures.&quot;

Two major exhibitions of Bonnard&#x27;s work took place in 1998: February through May at the Tate Gallery in London, and from June through October at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. In 2009, the exhibition &quot;Pierre Bonnard: The Late Interiors&quot; was shown at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Reviewing the exhibition for the magazine &quot;The New Republic&quot;, Jed Perl wrote:

&quot;Bonnard is the most thoroughly idiosyncratic of all the great twentieth-century painters. What sustains him is not traditional ideas of pictorial structure and order, but rather some unique combination of visual taste, psychological insight, and poetic feeling. He also has a quality that might be characterized as perceptual wit—an instinct for what will work in a painting. Almost invariably he recognizes the precise point where his voluptuousness may be getting out of hand, where he needs to introduce an ironic note. Bonnard&#x27;s wit has everything to do with the eccentric nature of his compositions. He finds it funny to sneak a figure into a corner, or have a cat staring out at the viewer. His metaphoric caprices have a comic edge, as when he turns a figure into a pattern in the wallpaper. And when he imagines a basket of fruit as a heap of emeralds and rubies and diamonds, he does so with the panache of a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat.&quot;
In 2016, the Legion of Honor in San Francisco hosted an exhibit &quot;Pierre Bonnard: Painting Arcadia&quot;, featuring more than 70 works spanning the artist&#x27;s entire career.

Bonnard&#x27;s record price in a public sale was for &quot;Terrasse à Vernon&quot;, sold by Christie&#x27;s in 2011 for €8,485,287 (£7,014,200).

In 2014, the painting &quot;La femme aux Deux Fauteuils&quot; (&quot;Woman with Two Armchairs&quot;), with an estimated value of around €600,000 (£497,000), which had been stolen in London in 1970, was discovered in Italy. The painting, together with a work by Paul Gauguin known as &quot;Fruit on a Table with a Small Dog&quot; had been bought by a Fiat employee in 1975, at a railway lost-property sale, for 45,000 lira (about £32).

Bonnard features heavily in the 2005 Booker prize winning novel, &quot;The Sea&quot; by John Banville. In the novel, the protagonist and art historian Max Morden is writing a book about Bonnard and discusses the painter&#x27;s life and work throughout.

Bonnard is played by Vincent Macaigne and Marthe by Cécile de France in the 2023 French film directed by Martin Provost &quot;Bonnard, Pierre and Marthe&quot;, which focuses on the couple&#x27;s romance. The movie premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival .

<doc id="362532" wikidata="Q6634230" url="?curid=362532" title="List of political parties in Northern Ireland">
<text>Although Northern Ireland is a part of the United Kingdom, it has a quite distinct party system from the rest of the country, as the Labour Party and Liberal Democrats do not contest elections there (though the Liberal Democrats have links with the Alliance Party), and the Conservative Party has received only limited support in recent elections. Party affiliation is generally based on religious and ethnic background.

The Northern Ireland Assembly is elected by single transferable vote and the composition of the Northern Ireland Executive is by power sharing determined by the D&#x27;Hondt system, among the members elected to the assembly. Northern Ireland also elects 18 MPs to the House of Commons, and there are elections to 11 local government districts.

Some parties, such as Sinn Féin and the Workers&#x27; Party, are organised on an all-Ireland basis. Others such as the Conservative Party are organised on an all-United Kingdom basis. There are many Northern Ireland-specific parties and these, on the whole, predominate.

The distinction between &quot;unionist/loyalist&quot;, &quot;nationalist/republican&quot; and &quot;other&quot; is not always easy with some parties and individuals. Some have defined themselves less by their position on the &quot;Border Question&quot; than on other political issues.

For example, the former Republican Labour Party/Social Democratic and Labour Party MP Gerry Fitt&#x27;s career suggests he was first and foremost a socialist rather than a nationalist and he eventually left the SDLP claiming it had drifted from its founding intentions. Similarly the Workers&#x27; Party has its roots in the republican Official IRA but nowadays is considered to be a non-violent socialist and nationalist party. Several parties strive to be avowedly non-sectarian and would not consider themselves to be either unionist or nationalist. The Northern Ireland Assembly requires MLAs to designate themselves either &quot;Unionist&quot;, &quot;Nationalist&quot; or &quot;Other&quot;. This is a designation that is particularly resented by those who designate as &quot;Other&quot;, as they have no input on who becomes First or Deputy First Minister.

There are some who see the terms &quot;Unionist&quot;/&quot;Loyalist&quot; and &quot;Nationalist&quot;/&quot;Republican&quot; as being of more relevance to the community that the party seeks to represent rather than the position on the border question. Several of the &quot;Other&quot; parties strive to be non-sectarian but have a clear position on the border.

<text>Howard Harold Hanson (October 28, 1896 – February 26, 1981) was an American composer, conductor, educator and music theorist. As director for forty years of the Eastman School of Music, he raised its quality and provided opportunities for commissioning and performing American classical music. In 1944, he won a Pulitzer Prize for his Symphony No. 4, and received numerous other awards including the George Foster Peabody Award for Outstanding Entertainment in Music in 1946.

==Early life and education==

Hanson was born in Wahoo, Nebraska, to Swedish immigrant parents, Hans and Hilma (née Eckstrom) Hanson. In his youth he studied music with his mother. Later, he studied at Luther College in Wahoo, receiving a diploma in 1911, then at the Institute of Musical Art, the forerunner of the Juilliard School, in New York City, where he studied with the composer and music theorist Percy Goetschius in 1914.

Afterward he attended Northwestern University, where he studied composition with church music expert Peter C. Lutkin and Arne Oldberg. Hanson also studied piano, cello, and trombone. He earned his BA degree in music from Northwestern in 1916, and began his teaching career as a teacher&#x27;s assistant.

==Career==
In 1916, Hanson was hired for his first full-time position as a music theory and composition teacher at the College of the Pacific in California. Only three years later, the college appointed him Dean of the Conservatory of Fine Arts in 1919. In 1920, Hanson composed &quot;The California Forest Play&quot;, his earliest work to receive national attention. Hanson also wrote a number of orchestral and chamber works during his years in California, including &quot;Concerto da Camera&quot;, &quot;Symphonic Legend&quot;, &quot;Symphonic Rhapsody&quot;, various solo piano works, such as &quot;Two Yuletide Pieces&quot;, and the &quot;Scandinavian Suite&quot;, which celebrated his Lutheran and Scandinavian heritage.

In 1921 Hanson was the first winner of the American Academy in Rome&#x27;s &quot;Rome Prize&quot; in musical composition, awarded for both &quot;The California Forest Play&quot; and his symphonic poem &quot;Before the Dawn&quot;. Thanks to the award, Hanson lived in Italy for three years. During his time in Italy, Hanson wrote a &quot;Quartet in One Movement&quot;, &quot;Lux Aeterna&quot;, &quot;The Lament for Beowulf&quot; (orchestration Bernhard Kaun), and his &quot;Symphony No. 1, &quot;Nordic&quot;&quot;, the premiere of which he conducted with the Augusteo Orchestra on May 30, 1923. The three years Hanson spent on his Fellowship at the American Academy were, he considered, the formative years of his life, as he was free to compose, conduct without the distraction of teaching—he could devote himself solely to his art. (It has been incorrectly stated that Hanson studied composition and/or orchestration with Ottorino Respighi, who in turn had studied orchestration with Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov. Hanson&#x27;s unpublished autobiography refutes the statement, attributed to Ruth Watanabe, that he had studied with Respighi.) While Hanson may not have pursued formal studies with Respighi while in Rome, he apparently did receive advice from him. In addition, Respighi invited Hanson to attend rehearsals and performances of his orchestral concerts. As a result of these interactions, Hanson credited Respighi as a significant influence on his use of orchestral textures and instrumentation. In addition, he cited the works of several other composers as being influential while studying in Rome including: Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Gustav Holst, Giovanni Palestrina and Richard Wagner.

Upon returning from Rome, Hanson&#x27;s conducting career expanded. He made his premiere conducting the New York Symphony Orchestra in his tone poem &quot;North and West&quot;. In Rochester, New York in 1924, he conducted his &quot;Symphony No. 1&quot;. This performance brought him to the attention of George Eastman.
In 1924, Eastman chose Hanson to be director of the Eastman School of Music. Eastman, inventor of the Kodak camera and roll film, was also a major philanthropist, and used some of his great wealth to endow the Eastman School of Music at the University of Rochester.

Hanson held the position of director for forty years, during which he created one of the most prestigious music schools in America. He accomplished this by improving the curriculum, bringing in better teachers, and refining the school&#x27;s orchestras. Also, he balanced the school&#x27;s faculty between American and European teachers, even when this meant passing up composer Béla Bartók. Hanson offered a position to Bartók teaching composition at Eastman, but Bartók declined as he did not believe that one could teach composition. Instead, Bartók wanted to teach piano at the Eastman School, but Hanson already had a full staff of piano instructors.
In 1925, Hanson established the American Composers Orchestral Concerts. He followed that in 1931 by establishing the annual Festivals of American Music. These week long concerts were free to the public and featured established works by American composers as well as premiers of new compositions. They included performances of: orchestral works, chamber music, band and wind ensemble music, vocal and chamber music, opera and ballet. The festival concerts were eagerly anticipated by audiences in Rochester until 1971 and were also broadcast regularly over national radio networks from the Eastman Theater. Critics have often observed that over the course of four decades &quot;more music has been played at these concerts than in all the rest of the United States put together.&quot;

Hanson&#x27;s interest in educating the general public through innovative means became apparent as early as 1938. At this time he engaged the talents of student ensembles at the Eastman School to present &quot;Milestones in the History of Music&quot; on the radio. This weekly series of programs presented a sweeping survey of the history of Western music which was broadcast locally in Rochester, New York on WHAM and nationally on the NBC Red Network. In recognition of these efforts, the Peabody Award for outstanding service to music was awarded to Hanson, the Eastman School and WHAM in 1946. Hanson also engaged his student ensembles to present a similar series for the CBS radio network which he entitled &quot;Milestones in American Music&quot;. This series presented orchestral, choral and chamber music composed by eighty two American composers from the mid 19th century to modern times. As Hanson himself indicated this was &quot;the first attempt at a rather complete presentation of the American picture in music.&quot;

Later in 1939, he founded the Eastman-Rochester Orchestra, which consisted of first chair players from the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra, faculty members from the Eastman School of Music and selected students from the Eastman School. For thirty years from 1939 to 1969 Hanson made over one hundred recordings for RCA Victor, Mercury Records and Columbia Records with the Eastman-Rochester Orchestra, not only of his own works, but also those of other American composers such as: Charles Ives, Wayne Barlow, John Alden Carpenter, Charles Tomlinson Griffes, Alan Hovhaness, Homer Keller, John Knowles Paine, Burrill Phillips, Walter Piston, Bernard Rogers, Roger Sessions, Leo Sowerby and William Grant Still. Hanson estimated that more than 2000 works by over 500 American composers were premiered during his tenure at the Eastman School.

To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Serge Koussevitzky commissioned Hanson&#x27;s &quot;Symphony No. 2, the &quot;Romantic&quot;&quot;, and premiered it on November 28, 1930. This work was to become Hanson&#x27;s best known. One of its themes is performed at the conclusion of all concerts at the Interlochen Center for the Arts. Now known as the &quot;Interlochen Theme&quot;, it is conducted by a student concertmaster after the featured conductor has left the stage. Traditionally, no applause follows its performance. It is also widely known for its use in the final scene and end credits of the 1979 Ridley Scott film &quot;Alien&quot;.

In some ways Hanson&#x27;s opera &quot;Merry Mount&quot; (1934) may be considered the first fully American opera. It was written by an American composer and an American librettist on an American story, and was premiered with a mostly American cast at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in 1934. The Opera received fifty curtain calls at its Met premiere, a record that still stands. In 1935, he wrote &quot;Three Songs from Drum Taps&quot;, based on the poem by Walt Whitman.

Frederick Fennell, conductor of the Eastman Wind Ensemble, described Hanson&#x27;s first band composition, the 1954 &quot;Chorale and Alleluia&quot; as &quot;the most awaited piece of music to be written for the wind band in my twenty years as a conductor in this field&quot;. &quot;Chorale and Alleluia&quot; is still a required competition piece for high school bands in the New York State School Music Association&#x27;s repertoire list.

By 1957, Hanson was inspired once again by the poetry of Walt Whitman and completed his &quot;Song of Democracy&quot; to mark the hundredth anniversary of the National Education Association and the fiftieth anniversary of the Music Educator&#x27;s National Conference. Hanson conducted its official premier with the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington D.C. before an audience of 23,000. This followed an unofficial performance in 1957 for President Eisenhower by Howard University&#x27;s African-American Chorus which subsequently performed the work in Constitution Hall a month later. By synthesizing his own musical idealism with Whitman&#x27;s robust optimism, Hanson composed a work which reflects the boundless possibilities of youthful creativity. The work incorporates a clear signature motto to his &quot;Romantic&quot; Symphony during the orchestral prelude as well as a largely harmonic setting for the chorus which culminates in a fervent hymn. Following its premier, &quot;Song of Democracy&quot; became a particularly favorite composition among all-city high school choruses and promoted the ideal vision of an inclusive democratic society which embodies tolerance and a respect for human rights.

During the 1950s and 1960s Howard Hanson continued to adapt innovative techniques in an effort to educate as large an audience as possible, even as revolutionary changes in mass media emerged in America. For example, he collaborated with the Ford Foundation during this period in order to produce a series of television films on composition. He also served as a member of the Music Advisory Panel of the American National Theatre and Academy along with Virgil Thomson, William Schuman and Milton Katims. This panel consisted of leading composers and academics who evaluated candidates for the Department of State&#x27;s Cultural Presentations program. Musicians who were accepted into this program represented America&#x27;s cultural diplomacy initiatives in concert venues throughout the world during the Cold War. In 1955, he conducted a concert in the Naumburg Orchestral Concerts, in the Naumburg Bandshell, Central Park, in the summer series. Later in the 1960s, he also hosted and conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic in several series of young peoples concerts for school children in the Los Angeles area. In 1960, Hanson also published a book &quot;Harmonic Materials of Modern Music&quot; (1960). Though not an example of integral music theory, it contained fruitful ideas and analytic algorithms which were incorporated in later theories such as set theory of Allen Forte. The idea of &#x27;modal modulation&#x27; (Hanson&#x27;s term) echoed in the Yuri Kholopov&#x27;s &#x27;variable mode&#x27; doctrine. 

Following his retirement as Director of the Eastman School of Music in 1964, Hanson was appointed as the first director of the newly established Institute for American Music at the University of Rochester. In this new role, Hanson continued his efforts to foster a widespread understanding and appreciation of American music through performances, publications and recordings. Operating funds for the institute were largely derived from royalties generated from compositions and recordings which were executed by Hanson during his tenure at the Eastman School. Following his death in 1981, Hanson&#x27;s wife Peggy assumed his responsibilities at the institute until her passing in 1996. It has been observed that nearly every American composer since World War I is indebted in some degree to Howard Hanson for his efforts to educate the public and future generations of professional musicians about American music.

Hanson was elected as a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1935, President of the Music Teachers&#x27; National Association from 1929 to 1930, and President of the National Association of Schools of Music from 1935 to 1939. From 1946 to 1962, he was active in United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). UNESCO commissioned Hanson&#x27;s &quot;Pastorale for Oboe and Piano&quot;, and &quot;Pastorale for Oboe, Strings, and Harp&quot;, for the 1949 Paris conference of the world body.

During the course of his career Hanson also served as a guest conductor for several leading orchestras including: the New York Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and the NBC Symphony Orchestra. He was also a frequent conductor of the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra at the Eastman Theater in Rochester, New York. In addition, he was the founder of the Eastman Philharmonia orchestra at the Eastman School of Music. This ensemble consisted of elite upperclassmen from the Eastman School of Music and was noted for concertizing throughout the country. Under Hanson&#x27;s leadership, it was selected to participate in the United States Department of State&#x27;s international cultural exchange program during the 1961–1962 season. Hanson took the Eastman Philharmonia on a European tour which passed through Paris, Cairo, Moscow, and Vienna, among other cities. The tour showcased the growth of serious American music for Europe and the Middle East.
Hanson&#x27;s performances with the orchestra received critical acclaim in thirty four cities and sixteen countries throughout Europe, the Middle East and Russia.

==Marriage==
Hanson met Margaret Elizabeth Nelson at her parents&#x27; summer home on Lake Chautauqua at the Chautauqua Institution in New York. Hanson dedicated the &quot;Serenade for Flute, Harp, and Strings&quot;, to her; the piece was his musical marriage proposal, as he could not find the spoken words to propose to her. They married on July 24, 1946, in the same house where they had first met.

==Popular culture==
Excerpts from Hanson&#x27;s Second Symphony were used to accompany several exterior sequences and the end credits in the released versions of Ridley Scott&#x27;s 1979 horror movie &quot;Alien&quot; without his permission, but the composer decided not to fight it in court—they replaced certain sections of Jerry Goldsmith&#x27;s original score at the behest of 20th Century Fox. This highlighted music can still be found on all DVD, Blu-Ray and 4K versions of &quot;Alien&quot;. The version used in the film is the 1967 recording by the National Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Charles Gerhardt. Apparently, Hanson told Gerhardt that, of all the available recordings, he found Gerhardt&#x27;s to be the most &#x27;sympathetic&#x27;.

==Death==
Hanson died at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, New York at the age of 84. He was survived by his wife Margaret Elizabeth Nelson.
==Compositional style==
Hanson&#x27;s music has been described as part of the Neo-Romantic movement in music which endeavored to continue the traditions of the Romantic era into the 20th century. His Symphony No. 2, for example, has been cited as a Neo-Romantic manifesto. He has also been identified by critics as an &quot;American Neoromantic composer &quot;par excellence&quot;&quot; whose compositions were conceived in the grand romantic tradition of Antonin Dvorák. In addition, his early symphonies have been characterized as &quot;splendidly effusive, gorgeously orchestrated, rich in harmonic texture&quot;.

It should also be noted, however, that Hanson&#x27;s compositions also incorporated experimentation with modern musical idioms. Many of the passages in his works are based upon modal scales which call to mind Gregorian chants. In addition, he made extensive use of extended tertian chords, motoric ostinati in rapid passages and alternating triadic chords. Several of his liturgical and choral compositions also reflected themes derived from Swedish Lutheran hymns. Elements of Nordic austerity identified in his music have also prompted some observers to compare him to Jean Sibelius.

It has also been noted that one of Hanson&#x27;s hallmarks as a composer is his utilization of melodic lines which flow seamlessly in a manner which is almost improvisational, unpretentious, and very American. The composer and critic David Owens indicated that Hanson clearly embraced the use of tonal beauty in his compositions in order to give expression to a conservative musical ideal. By carefully blending his use of tonality with a masterful understanding of orchestral depth, Hanson succeeded in producing compositions which Owen described as being both memorable and compelling.

Perhaps Hanson described his music best when he portrayed it as metaphorically &quot;springing from the soil of the American midwest. It is music of the plains rather than of the city and reflects, I believe, something of the broad prairies of my native Nebraska.&quot;

<doc id="362534" wikidata="Q4942334" url="?curid=362534" title="Bonnie Dundee">
<text>Bonnie Dundee is the title of a poem and a song written by Walter Scott in 1825 in honour of John Graham, 7th Laird of Claverhouse, who was created 1st Viscount Dundee in November 1688, then in 1689 led a Jacobite rising in which he died, becoming a Jacobite hero.

The older tune &quot;Bonny Dundee&quot; adapted by Scott had already been used for several songs appearing under variations of that title and referring to the bonnie town of Dundee rather than to Claverhouse. Scott&#x27;s song has been used as a regimental march by several Scottish regiments in the British Army, as well as the official Canter for the Royal Horse Artillery.

==Bonny Dundee: tunes and songs==
&quot;Bonny Dundee&quot; is a very old Scottish folk-tune used for at least fifteen songs. A simpler version of the tune appears in the Skene manuscript around 1630 under the title &quot;Adew, Dundee&quot;. The title &quot;Bonny Dundee&quot; for the tune appears in an appendix to John Playford&#x27;s 1688 edition of &quot;The Dancing Master&quot;, an English publication. The tune has been used for the following popular song:
:O whaur gat ye that hauver-meal bannock?
::Silly blind body, O dinna ye see?
:I gat it frae a brisk sodger laddie,
::Atween Saint Johnstone and Bonnie Dundee.

:O, gin I saw the laddie that gae me&#x27;t!
::Aft has he doudl&#x27;d me on o&#x27; his knee.
:But now he&#x27;s awa&#x27;, and I dinner ken whaur he&#x27;s,
::O gin he was back to his minnie and me!

&quot;Saint Johnstone&quot; refers to Perth, and &quot;Bonny Dundee&quot; is the town of Dundee. This song was parodied in English publications of the early 18th century with coarser wording, under the title &quot;Jockey&#x27;s Deliverance, or the Valiant Escape from Dundee&quot;, to be sung &quot;to an Excellent Tune, called &quot;Bonny Dundee&quot;.&quot; A 1719 collection titled the parody &quot;Jockey&#x27;s Escape from Dundee; and the Parsons Daughter whom he had Mowd&quot;, and its chorus featured variations on &quot;Come open the Gates, and let me go free, And shew me the way to bonny Dundee&quot;. Robert Burns rewrote the second verse of the original, so that the latter lines were &quot;May Heaven protect my Bonnie Scots laddie, and send him safe hame to his baby and me.&quot; He added a concluding verse with the promise to the baby to &quot;bigg a bower on yon bonnie banks, where Tay rins dimpling by sae clear&quot;, alluding to the River Tay. Another version of the original, titled &quot;Scots Callan O&#x27; Bonnie Dundee&quot;, refers to a callant (lad) rather than a soldier, and a &quot;bonnie blue bonnet&quot; instead of a bannock.

The tune is used for unrelated words in a broadside ballad published in 1701 under the title &quot;Bonny Dundee&quot;, suggesting that it was to be sung to this melody, and in John Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; published in 1765.

==Graham of Claverhouse==
From 1668 John Graham, the laird of Claverhouse was at the forefront of Royalist repression of the Covenanters, for which he was called &quot;Bluidy Clavers&quot; (Bloody Claverhouse) by his covenanting opponents. In 1688 he was made 1st Viscount of Dundee by James VII of Scotland (James II of England). When William of Orange overturned James in 1688 in what was called the Glorious Revolution, Claverhouse was one of the few Scottish nobles who remained loyal to James. After trying to influence the Convention of Estates of Scotland on James&#x27;s behalf, at some danger to himself, he led his cavalry out of Edinburgh to carry on the struggle in the field and was killed at the moment of victory in the battle of Killiecrankie (1689). His forces were subsequently defeated at the Battle of Dunkeld. Over a century later he was immortalised in a poem by Walter Scott which was later adapted into a song.

==Walter Scott&#x27;s poem==
Walter Scott&#x27;s novel &quot;Old Mortality&quot;, published in 1816, gives a sympathetic portrait of Claverhouse. The story mentions one of Claverhouse&#x27;s troopers &quot;humming the lively Scottish air, &#x27;Between Saint Johnstone and Bonny Dundee, I&#x27;ll gar ye be fain to follow me&#x27;.&quot; In this, &quot;Saint Johnstone&quot; refers to Perth, and &quot;Bonny&quot; was the common description of the town of Dundee before Scott transferred the description to Claverhouse.

On 22 December 1825 Scott wrote in his journal:
Scott sent a copy of the verses to his daughter-in-law Jane, mentioning that his great-grandfather had been among Claverhouse&#x27;s followers and describing himself as &quot;a most incorrigible Jacobite&quot;. This is a comic exaggeration, but Scott&#x27;s ballad is certainly written from the point of view of Claverhouse, whom he had already celebrated in his novel Old Mortality (1816). It consists of eleven stanzas, which Scott admitted was &quot;greatly too long&quot; (Letters, vol. 9, p. 350), with a refrain copied from the traditional song &quot;Jockey&#x27;s Escape from Dundee&quot;.

The poem was first published in a miscellany, &quot;The Christmas Box&quot; (1828-9), and then included as a song in Scott&#x27;s unperformed play &quot;The Doom of Devorgoil&quot; (1830). Later adaptations for singing include only stanzas 1, 2, 8 and 10, with the refrain. After Scott&#x27;s death, many changes were made in the text in different republications. Some add extra Scotticisms, e.g. &quot;To the lords&quot; becomes &quot;Tae the lairds&quot;. The authentic long text below comes from &quot;The Poetical Works of Sir Walter Scott&quot;, Bart. (12 vols., 1833-4), ed. J. G. Lockhart (vol. 12, pp. 903–4).

===Scott&#x27;s original poem===
:To the Lords of Convention &#x27;twas Clavers who spoke.
:&#x27;Ere the King&#x27;s crown shall fall there are crowns to be broke;
:So let each Cavalier who loves honour and me,
:Come follow the bonnet of Bonny Dundee.
::(chorus)
::&quot;Come fill up my cup, come fill up my can,&quot;
::&quot;Come saddle your horses, and call up your men;&quot;
::&quot;Come open the West Port and let me gae free, &quot;
::&quot;And it&#x27;s room for the bonnets of Bonny Dundee!&quot;
:Dundee he is mounted, he rides up the street,
:The bells are rung backward, the drums they are beat;
:But the Provost, man, said, &quot;Just e&#x27;en let him be,
:The Gude Town is weel quit of that De&#x27;il Dundee.&quot;
::(chorus)
:As he rode down the sanctified bends of the Bow,
: was flyting and shaking her ;
:But the young plants of grace they looked and slee,
:Thinking luck to thy bonnet, thou Bonny Dundee!
::(chorus)
:With sour-featured Whigs the Grass-market was crammed,
:As if half the West had set tryst to be hanged;
:There was spite in each look, there was fear in each e&#x27;e,
:As they watched for the bonnets of Bonny Dundee.
::(chorus)
:These cowls of Kilmarnock had spits and had spears,
:And lang-hafted to kill cavaliers;
:But they shrunk to close-heads and the causeway was free,
:At the toss of the bonnet of Bonny Dundee.
::(chorus)
:He spurred to the foot of the proud Castle rock,
:And with the gay Gordon he gallantly spoke;
:&quot;Let Mons Meg and her marrows speak twa words or three,
:For the love of the bonnet of Bonny Dundee.&quot;
::(chorus)
:The Gordon demands of him which way he goes?
:&quot;Where&#x27;er shall direct me the shade of Montrose!
:Your Grace in short space shall hear tidings of me,
:Or that low lies the bonnet of Bonny Dundee.
::(chorus)
:&quot;There are hills beyond Pentland and lands beyond Forth,
:If there&#x27;s lords in the Lowlands, there&#x27;s chiefs in the North;
:There are wild three thousand times three,
:Will &quot;cry hoigh!&quot; for the bonnet of Bonny Dundee.
::(chorus)
:&quot;There&#x27;s brass on the target of barkened bull-hide;
:There&#x27;s steel in the scabbard that dangles beside;
:The brass shall be burnished, the steel shall flash free,
:At the toss of the bonnet of Bonny Dundee.
::(chorus)
:&quot;Away to the hills, to the caves, to the rocks
:Ere I own an usurper, I&#x27;ll couch with the fox;
:And tremble, false Whigs, in the midst of your glee,
:You have not seen the last of my bonnet and me!&quot;
::(chorus)
:He waved his proud hand, the trumpets were blown,
:The kettle-drums clashed and the horsemen rode on,
:Till on Ravelston&#x27;s cliffs and on Clermiston&#x27;s lee
:Died away the wild war-notes of Bonny Dundee.
::&quot;Come fill up my cup, come fill up my can,&quot;
::&quot;Come saddle the horses, and call up the men,&quot;
::&quot;Come open your gates, and let me gae free,&quot;
::&quot;For it&#x27;s up with the bonnets of Bonny Dundee!&quot;
==The song==
There are several versions of the song and a common one is given here.

:Tae the lairds i&#x27; convention t&#x27;was Claverhouse spoke
:E&#x27;er the Kings crown go down, there&#x27;ll be crowns to be broke;
:Then let each cavalier who loves honour and me
:Come follow the bonnet o&#x27; bonnie Dundee.
::&quot;(Chorus):&quot;
::Come fill up my cup, come fill up my can
::Saddle my horses and call out my men
::And it&#x27;s Ho! for the west port and let us gae free,
::And we&#x27;ll follow the bonnets o&#x27; bonnie Dundee!
:Dundee he is mounted, he rides doon the street,
:The bells they ring backwards, the drums they are beat,
:But the Provost, douce man, says &quot;Just e&#x27;en let him be
:For the toon is well rid of that de&#x27;il o&#x27; Dundee.&quot;
::&quot;(Chorus):&quot;
:There are hills beyond Pentland and lands beyond Forth,
:Be there lairds i&#x27; the south, there are chiefs i&#x27; the north!
:There are brave duniewassals, three thousand times three
:Will cry &quot;Hoy!&quot; for the bonnets o&#x27; bonnie Dundee.
::&quot;(Chorus):&quot;
:Then awa&#x27; to the hills, to the lea, to the rocks
:E&#x27;er I own a usurper, I&#x27;ll couch wi&#x27; the fox!
:Then tremble, false Whigs, in the midst o&#x27; your glee
:Ye ha&#x27; no seen the last o&#x27; my bonnets and me.
::&quot;(Chorus):&quot;

==Scott&#x27;s attribution of the tune==
To help Jane identify the tune, Scott gave a few lines from each of three songs for which it had been used. His first quotation is from &quot;Jockey&#x27;s Escape from Dundee&quot;; the second is from &quot;Scots Callan o&#x27; Bonnie Dundee&quot; (though a version of these lines also appears in &quot;Jockey&#x27;s Escape&quot;); and the third is from John Gay, &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; (1728; Air LVII, &quot;The Charge is prepar&#x27;d&quot;).

The transcriptions of the tune for different sets of words vary both in notes and in rhythmic phrasing. The version in &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; differs most widely, with most of the dotted rhythms smoothed out into a regular succession of crotchets. We cannot say whether Scott had any particular variation in mind; he professed to have a good ear for time but little or none for tune. All are in a minor key, and their melancholy and their subtle rhythms will surprise anyone familiar only with the setting now best known.

This later setting, with its cheerful major key and cantering rhythm, suits both the spirit of Scott&#x27;s lines and their metre, and makes an excellent cavalry march. Scott might well have approved: he intended the verses &quot;to be sung a la militaire&quot; and not as the song is in &quot;The Beggars Opera&quot;. In this tune, too, variations occur in different publications.

The origin of this immensely popular tune is uncertain. It makes use of the Lombard rhythm or &quot;Scotch snap&quot;, and may owe something to Scottish folk-song. It seems first to have been used about 1850 and was associated with the contralto and composer Charlotte Dolby, later Sainton-Dolby (1821–85). The sheet music of &quot;Bonnie Dundee&quot; was published by Boosey &amp; Sons as &quot;sung by Miss Dolby&quot; and (after 1860) &quot;sung by Madame Sainton-Dolby&quot;, but Boosey credits her only with performing the song and arranging the accompaniment; no composer is named, and Boosey lists the piece as a &quot;Scotch Air&quot;. However, &quot;Bonnie Dundee&quot; has been included among Dolby&#x27;s works.

It has been suggested that the melody comes from a piano piece called &quot;The Band at a Distance&quot;, and that it was Dolby who first combined this tune with Scott&#x27;s words. A score for piano or harp called &quot;The Band at a Distance&quot;, by Nicolas-Charles Bochsa, was published by Walker &amp; Son c. 1830, but has no resemblance to &quot;Bonnie Dundee&quot;.

In the &quot;Scottish Orpheus&quot; (1897), Adam Hamilton gives the song as &quot;Composed by Dr E. F. Rimbault. Arranged by Edward Rimbault Dibdin&quot; (p. 52). This attribution has not been confirmed. Edward Francis Rimbault (1816-1876) was a prolific writer of and about music, but his songs are not listed separately in any bibliography. His name sometimes appears as having &quot;arranged&quot; &quot;Bonnie Dundee&quot;.

==Marches==
The song is the authorized regimental march for the following Canadian regiments:
*The Royal Canadian Horse Artillery (gallop past)
*1st Hussars
*The Brockville Rifles
*The Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry Highlanders
*The Loyal Edmonton Regiment (4th Battalion, Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry)
*The Queen&#x27;s Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada (D Company)

It is used by several British cavalry regiments and the Royal Horse Artillery, in addition to being the regimental march for Tayforth Universities Officers Training Corps which is based in Dundee

==Parodies and alternative versions==
Scott&#x27;s song was parodied by Lewis Carroll in &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; and by Rudyard Kipling in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;.

William McGonagall praised the town of Dundee in 1878.

A 1904 broadside ballad titled &quot;The Bailies of Bonnie Dundee&quot; parodied Scott&#x27;s song to raise accusations of corruption by members of Dundee&#x27;s burgh council.

===Lewis Carroll===
From Chapter IX of &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;, 1871:

:To the Looking-Glass world it was Alice that said
:&quot;I&#x27;ve a sceptre in hand, I&#x27;ve a crown on my head.
:Let the Looking-Glass creatures, whatever they be
:Come dine with the Red Queen, the White Queen and Me!&quot;

:Then fill up the glasses as quick as you can,
:And sprinkle the table with buttons and bran:
:Put cats in the coffee, and mice in the tea--
:And welcome Queen Alice with thirty-times-three!

:&quot;O Looking-Glass creatures,&quot; quoth Alice, &quot;draw near!
:&#x27;Tis an honour to see me, a favour to hear:
:&#x27;Tis a privilege high to have dinner and tea
:Along with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and Me!&quot;

:Then fill up the glasses with treacle and ink,
:Or anything else that is pleasant to drink:
:Mix sand with the cider, and wool with the wine--
:And welcome Queen Alice with ninety-times-nine!

===William McGonagall===
William McGonagall returned to the idea of praising the town in &quot;Bonnie Dundee in 1878&quot;. The opening lines quoted below exemplify McGonagall&#x27;s inimitable style:
:Oh, Bonnie Dundee! I will sing in thy praise
:A few but true simple lays,
:Regarding some of your beauties of the present day
:And virtually speaking, there’s none can them gainsay;
:There’s no other town I know of with you can compare
:For spinning mills and lasses fair,
:And for stately buildings there’s none can excel
:The beautiful Albert Institute or the Queen’s Hotel,

===Orthodoxee===
In 1892 there was a protest in the Highlands of Scotland against the Free Church of Scotland&#x27;s Declaratory Act, which modified the denomination&#x27;s adherence to the orthodoxy of the Westminster Confession of Faith and &quot;abandoned the whole system of thought for which it stood.&quot; Initially the protest was led by Rev. Murdoch Macaskill of Dingwall, though he did not in the end separate with the two ministers from Syke who created the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland in 1893.

The poem &#x27;Orthodoxee&#x27; was published in the &#x27;Grantown Supplement&#x27; weekly newspaper, Grantown-on-Spey, on 25 June 1892.

:Orthodoxee
:(To the tune: &#x27;Bonnie Dundee&#x27;)

:To the Highland Convention Macaskill thus spoke -
:&quot;If the Free Kirk’s not ‘sound’ there’s a kirk to be broke,
:Then each sturdy supporter of orthodoxee,
:Let him follow the lead of Mackenzie and me.&quot;

:Chorus:
:&quot;Come wallop me, Dods, come wallop me, Bruce,
:Come saddle me, Drummond, with loads of abuse;
:Unloosen your tongues like Balfour and me,
:Or it’s up with the prospects of orthodoxee.&quot;

:&quot;Mackenzie he is roused, he has got on his feet:
:He’ll break the Free Kirk ere he’ll sound a retreat.&quot;
:(But Rainy, douse man, said, &quot;Just e’en let it be,
:For the Kirk is well rid o’ their orthodoxee.&quot;)

:&quot;If the Kirk is determined, for all it is worth,
:To alter its Creed, we’ll disrupt in the North,
:For all the adherents of orthodoxee
:Are ready to swear by Mackenzie and me.&quot;

:&quot;Then away to the hills; set the heather ablaze,
:And raise such a smoke as you only can raise:
:We’ll see if we can’t make these heretics be
:More tenderly careful of orthodoxee.&quot;

===Rudyard Kipling===

From &quot;Parade Song of the Camp Animals&quot;, which follows the story &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s Servants&quot;, in The Jungle Book published in 1894:

:By the brand on my shoulder, the finest of tunes
:Is played by the Lancers, Hussars, and Dragoons,
:And it&#x27;s sweeter than &quot;Stables&quot; or &quot;Water&quot; to me--
:The Cavalry Canter of &quot;Bonnie Dundee&quot;!

:Then feed us and break us and handle and groom,
:And give us good riders and plenty of room,
:And launch us in column of squadron and see
:The way of the war-horse to &quot;Bonnie Dundee&quot;!

==American Civil War==

===Riding a Raid (Traditional)===

During the American Civil War traditional English, Irish, and Scottish songs were often sung or modified. The Confederates did this very often. The song &quot;Riding a Raid&quot; takes place during the 1862 Antietam Campaign. J.E.B. Stuart&#x27;s Confederate cavalry set off on a screening movement on the flank of Robert E. Lee&#x27;s army in order to give Lee time to prepare his army to meet the Union Army after Northern general George B. McClellan had gained information on Lee&#x27;s location and plans. The Campaign would culminate in the battle of Antietam, or Sharpsburg as the Confederates called it. This would be the bloodiest day in American history and while the battle was indecisive, Lee was forced to abandon any hope of continuing the campaign.

: Riding a Raid

:&#x27;Tis old Stonewall the Rebel that leans on his sword,
:And while we are mounting prays low to the Lord:
:&quot;Now each cavalier that loves honor and right,
:Let him follow the feather of Stuart tonight.&quot;

:&quot;Chorus:&quot;
:Come tighten your girth and slacken your rein;
:Come buckle your blanket and holster again;
:Try the click of your trigger and balance your blade,
:For he must ride sure that goes riding a raid.

:Now gallop, now gallop to swim or to ford!
:Old Stonewall, still watching, prays low to the Lord:
:&quot;Goodbye, dear old Rebel! The river&#x27;s not wide,
:And Maryland&#x27;s lights in her window to guide.&quot;

:&quot;Chorus:&quot;

:There&#x27;s a man in the White House with blood on his mouth!
:If there&#x27;s knaves in the North, there are braves in the South.
:We are three thousand horses, and not one afraid;
:We are three thousand sabres and not a dull blade.

:&quot;Chorus:&quot;

:Then gallop, then gallop by ravines and rocks!
:Who would bar us the way take his toll in hard knocks;
:For with these points of steel, on the line of the Penn
:We have made some fine strokes -- and we&#x27;ll make &#x27;em again

:&quot;Chorus:&quot;

==Second Boer War==

During the final phase of the Second Boer War, Afrikaner residents of Winburg taunted the local British garrison with a parody of &quot;Bonnie Dundee&quot;, which was typically sung in English. The parody celebrated the guerrilla warfare of Boer commando Christiaan De Wet.

: De Wet he is mounted, he rides up the street
: The English skedaddle an A1 retreat!
: And the commander swore: They&#x27;ve got through the net
: That&#x27;s been spread with such care for Christiaan De Wet.

: There are hills beyond Winburg and Boers on each hill
: Sufficient to thwart ten generals&#x27; skill
: There are stout-hearted burghers 10,000 men set
: On following the Mausers of Christian De Wet.

: Then away to the hills, to the veld, to the rocks
: Ere we own a usurper we&#x27;ll crouch with the fox
: And tremble false Jingoes amidst all your glee
: Ye have not seen the last of my Mausers and me!

<text>Henri Paul Cartan (; 8 July 1904 – 13 August 2008) was a French mathematician who made substantial contributions to algebraic topology.

He was the son of the mathematician Élie Cartan, nephew of mathematician Anna Cartan, oldest brother of composer , physicist and mathematician , and the son-in-law of physicist Pierre Weiss.

==Life==
According to his own words, Henri Cartan was interested in mathematics at a very young age, without being influenced by his family. He moved to Paris with his family after his father&#x27;s appointment at Sorbonne in 1909 and he attended secondary school at Lycée Hoche in Versailles.

In 1923 he started studying mathematics at École Normale Supérieure, receiving an agrégation in 1926 and a doctorate in 1928. His PhD thesis, entitled &quot;Sur les systèmes de fonctions holomorphes à variétés linéaires lacunaires et leurs applications&quot;, was supervised by Paul Montel.

Cartan taught at Lycée Malherbe in Caen from 1928 to 1929, at the University of Lille from 1929 to 1931 and at the University of Strasbourg from 1931 to 1939. After the German invasion of France the university staff was moved to Clermont Ferrand, but in 1940 he returned to Paris to work at Université de Paris and École Normale Supérieure. From 1969 until his retirement in 1975 he was professor at Paris-Sud University.

Cartan died on 13 August 2008 at the age of 104. His funeral took place the following Wednesday on 20 August in Die, Drome.

==Honours and awards==
In 1932 Cartan was invited to give a Cours Peccot at the Collège de France. In 1950 he was elected president of the Société mathématique de France and from 1967 to 1970 he was president of the International Mathematics Union. He was awarded the Émile Picard Medal in 1959, the CNRS Gold Medal in 1976, and the Wolf Prize in 1980.

He was an invited Speaker at the International Congress of Mathematics in 1932 in Zürich and a Plenary Speaker at the ICM in 1950 in Cambridge, Massachusetts and in 1958 in Edinburgh.

From 1974 until his death he had been a member of the French Academy of Sciences. He was elected a foreign member of many academies and societies, including the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1950), London Mathematical Society (1959), Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters (1962), (1967), Royal Society of London (1971), Göttingen Academy of Sciences and Humanities (1971), Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences (1971), United States National Academy of Sciences (1972), Bavarian Academy of Science (1974), Royal Academy of Belgium (1978), Japan Academy (1979), Finnish Academy of Science and Letters (1979), Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (1981), Polish Academy of Sciences (1985) and Russian Academy of Sciences (1999).

He was awarded Honorary Doctorates from Münster (1952), ETH Zürich (1955), Oslo (1961), Sussex (1969), Cambridge (1969), Stockholm (1978), Oxford University (1980), Zaragoza (1985) and Athens (1992).

The French government named him Commandeur des Palmes Académiques in 1964, Officier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1965 and Commandeur de l&#x27;Ordre du Mérite in 1971.

== Political and social activities ==
During the 70&#x27;s and the 80&#x27;s Cartan used his influence to help obtain the release of several dissident mathematicians, including Leonid Plyushch and Anatoly Shcharansky, imprisoned by the Soviet Union, Jose Luis Massera, imprisoned between 1975 and 1984 by the Uruguayan dictatorship, and Sion Assidon, imprisoned during the Moroccan Years of Lead. For his humanitarian efforts, he received in 1989 the Heinz R. Pagels Human Rights of Scientists Award from the New York Academy of Sciences.

Since the 30&#x27;s Cartan had tight collaborations with many German mathematicians, including Heinrich Behnke and Peter Thullen. Right after World War II he put many efforts to improve the cooperation between French and German mathematicians and restore the flow of exchanges of ideas and students.

Cartan supported the idea of European Federalism and from 1974 to 1985 was president of the French section of the Union of European Federalists. At the 1984 European elections he was the leader of the &quot;Liste pour les États-Unis d&#x27;Europe&quot;, which obtained 0.4% of votes and did not elect any candidate.

In 1992 he gave a speech at the first European Congress of Mathematics in Paris, remarking the common heritage and future of European countries and praising the first reunion between mathematicians from the two previously separated parts of Europe.

== Research ==
Cartan worked in several fields across algebra, geometry and analysis, focussing primarily on algebraic topology and homological algebra.

He was a founding member of the Bourbaki group in 1934 and one of its most active participants. After 1945 he started his own seminar in Paris, which deeply influenced Jean-Pierre Serre, Armand Borel, Alexander Grothendieck and Frank Adams, amongst others of the leading lights of the younger generation. The number of his official students was small, but includes Joséphine Guidy Wandja (the first African woman to gain a PhD in mathematics), Adrien Douady, Roger Godement, Max Karoubi, Jean-Louis Koszul, Jean-Pierre Serre and René Thom.

Cartan&#x27;s first research interests, until the 40&#x27;s, were in the theory of functions of several complex variables, which later gave rise to the theory of complex varieties and analytic geometry. Motivated by the solution to the Cousin problems, he worked on sheaf cohomology and coherent sheaves and proved two powerful results, Cartan&#x27;s theorems A and B.

Since the 50&#x27;s he became more interested in algebraic topology. Among his major contributions, he worked on cohomology operations and homology of the Eilenberg–MacLane spaces, he introduced the notion of Steenrod algebra, and, together with Jean-Pierre Serre, developed the method of &quot;killing homotopy groups&quot;. His 1956 book with Samuel Eilenberg on homological algebra was an important text, treating the subject with a moderate level of abstraction with the help of category theory. They introduced fundamental concepts, including those of projective module, weak dimension, and what is now called the Cartan–Eilenberg resolution.

Among his other contributions, in general topology he introduced the notions of filter and ultrafilter and in potential theory he developed the fine topology and proved Cartan&#x27;s lemma. The Cartan model for equivariant cohomology is also named after him.

<text>John Arthur Todd (23 August 1908 – 22 December 1994) was an English mathematician who specialised in geometry.

==Biography==
He was born in Liverpool, and went up to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1925. He did research under H.F. Baker, and in 1931 took a position at the University of Manchester. He became a lecturer at Cambridge in 1937. He remained at Cambridge for the rest of his working life.

==Work==
The Todd class in the theory of the higher-dimensional Riemann–Roch theorem is an example of a characteristic class (or, more accurately, a reciprocal of one) that was discovered by Todd in work published in 1937. It used the methods of the Italian school of algebraic geometry. The Todd–Coxeter process for coset enumeration is a major method of computational algebra, and dates from a collaboration with H.S.M. Coxeter in 1936. In 1953 he and Coxeter discovered the Coxeter–Todd lattice. In 1954 he and G. C. Shephard classified the finite complex reflection groups.

==Honours==
In March 1948 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

<text>Donna Leon (; born September 28, 1942) is the American author of a series of crime novels set in Venice, Italy, featuring the fictional hero Commissario Guido Brunetti. The novels are written in English, and have been translated into many foreign languages, althoughat Leon&#x27;s requestnot into Italian, as she formerly lived there, still visits monthly, and prefers not to have recognition in the country.

==Early life and education==
Donna Leon was born on September 28, 1942 in Montclair, New Jersey, to Roman Catholic parents, who had strong leanings to the Democratic party. Her paternal grandparents were Spanish and her maternal grandparents were Irish and German. She grew up in Bloomfield, New Jersey. Her parents put a strong focus on education for their daughter.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; reports: &quot;Leon was teaching in Iran while attempting to complete a PhD about Jane Austen when the revolution of 1978-79 interrupted her studies and her life. When her trunks were returned to her months later, following her hasty evacuation (part of it at gunpoint, on a bus), her papers were gone.&quot; She returned to the US and worked in New York City writing advertising copy. When she visited Italy for the first time, she fell in love with the country.

==Teaching and residence ==
Leon was a lecturer in English literature for the University of Maryland University CollegeEurope (UMUC-Europe) in Venice, and taught English from 1981 to 1990 at an American military base in Italy.

In 2015, Leon left Venice after 30 years, and began to split her time between the homes she owns in Switzerland, one in Zürich and another in the mountains. she resided mainly in the small village of Val Müstair in the mountains of Grisons. she was returning to Venice approximately one week each month.

In 2020 she became a Swiss citizen.

==Career==
Leon wrote a crime novel after seeing a scene she thought belonged in such a novel. She wrote it in 8 months and stuck it in a drawer until a friend persuaded her to submit to a writing contest, which she won.

==Setting and viewpoints of the Brunetti novels==
The police commissioner Guido Brunetti confronts crime in and around his home town of Venice. Each case is an opportunity for the author to reveal another aspect of the seamy underside of society and another facet of Venetian life. Brunetti reports to the vain and self-serving buffoon, Vice-Questore Patta, while Sergente (later Ispettore and with the inspector per &quot;tu&quot;) Vianello and the all-knowing and well-connected Signorina Elettra, Patta&#x27;s secretary, assists Brunetti on the ground and through research.

These novels are successful in Germany and translated into many languages, though not Italian.

==Recognition and awards==
Her Commissario Brunetti novels are written in English, but have been translated into many foreign languages, althoughat Leon&#x27;s requestnot into Italian.

The ninth Brunetti novel, &quot;Friends in High Places&quot;, won the Crime Writers&#x27; Association Silver Dagger in 2000.

Worldcat summary: &quot;Accompanied by a CD of Italian boat songs, this fascinating history of the gondola, which was first used in medieval Venice as a maneuverable getaway boat, reveals how it evolved over the centuries into a floating pleasure palace that facilitated the romantic escapades of the Venetian elite.&quot; Notes: &quot;With a CD of Venetian barcarole performed by Il Pomo d&#x27;Oro, conducted by Riccardo Minasi, featuring Vincenzo Capezzuto and Cecilia Bartoli.&quot;

==Spin-offs==
Leon&#x27;s Commissario Brunetti novels have spawned multiple spin-off enterprises, including:

* A travel guidebook: 
*Walking Tours of Guido Brunetti&#x27;s Venice with accompanying maps: Dr. Toni Sepeda,&quot;the only lecturer authorized by Donna Leon to conduct events in Brunetti&#x27;s Venicea&quot;, leads individual and group tours of the locations and routes noted in Leon&#x27;s Commissario Guido Brunetti novels.

<doc id="362560" wikidata="Q5153890" url="?curid=362560" title="Commonwealth of Britain Bill">
<text>The Commonwealth of Britain Bill was a bill first introduced in the House of Commons in 1991 by Tony Benn, then a Labour Member of Parliament (MP). It was seconded by the future Leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn.

The Bill proposed abolishing the British monarchy, with the United Kingdom becoming a &quot;democratic, federal and secular Commonwealth of Britain&quot;, or in effect a republic with a codified constitution. It was introduced by Benn a number of times until Benn&#x27;s retirement in 2001, but never achieved a second reading. Under the Bill:

*The monarchy would be abolished and the constitutional status of the Crown ended, with ownership and control of former Crown lands, buildings, and properties transferred to the Commonwealth government;
*The Church of England would be disestablished, with powers over faith, doctrine, liturgy, property, discipline and appointments formerly exercised by the Crown, Parliament or private patrons transferred to the General Synod of the Church of England;
*The head of state would be a president, elected by a joint sitting of both Houses of the Commonwealth Parliament;
*The functions of the royal prerogative would be transferred to the President, who shall exercise it on the advice of either the Prime Minister, or by a resolution of the House of Commons;
*The Privy Council would be abolished, and replaced by a Council of State;
*The House of Lords would be replaced by an elected House of the People that proportionally represents the nations of England, Scotland, and Wales, with equal representation of men and women;
*The House of Commons would similarly have equal representation of men and women;
*England, Scotland and Wales would have their own devolved National Parliaments with responsibility for devolved matters as agreed, and the power of local authorities would be free to act in the interests of their constituencies, barring acts banned by an Act of Parliament; 
*County Court judges and magistrates would be elected;
*British jurisdiction over Northern Ireland would be ended;
*The judiciary would be reformed and a National Legal Service would be created.
*The Official Secrets Acts 1911, 1920, 1939, and 1989 would be repealed, and all official information published or available on request, save for information relating to defense and security matters, economic policy, international relations, and personal data;
*The Constitution would be codified and an amendment process established.
*The voting age would be lowered from 18 to 16.
*MPs and other officials would swear oaths to the Constitution, not the Crown.

<text>Marcus Lodewijk Schenkenberg van Mierop (born 4 August 1968) is a Swedish model.

== Modelling ==
Schenkenberg is best known for his Calvin Klein advertisements. He has also modelled for Versace, Giorgio Armani, Donna Karan and Iceberg. In the past he has been signed to Storm Model Management in London, Wilhelmina Models, &quot;Success Models&quot; in Paris, Boss Models, and D&#x27; Management Group in Milan. His present, main agency is Kuhlmann Consulting Group in Germany, holding all licences, minor Ford Models and Soul Artist Management in New York.

==Television==
Marcus Schenkenberg has also appeared—mostly as himself—in many episodes of different international TV shows including the Pamela Anderson vehicle &quot;V.I.P.&quot; (2001), American soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, &quot;Stacked&quot; (2005), on VH1&#x27;s fourth season of &quot;The Surreal Life&quot; or &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. In Italy these were &quot;The Corlucci Cald Show&quot;, &quot;La Grande Notte del Lunedì Sera&quot;, and &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; (2002) as well as &quot;La Talpa&quot; (2004), the Italian version of &quot;Celebrity Mole&quot;. Further he was guest host of an Italian soccer TV program and appeared on VH1&#x27;s fourth season of &quot;The Surreal Life&quot;. Schenkenberg has guested in several German TV shows such as &quot;the Bambi&quot; (2003), Heidi Klum&#x27;s &quot;Germany&#x27;s Next Topmodel&quot; (2006 and 2023) and took part at Stefan Raab&#x27;s &quot;Wok racing&quot; (2010).

===Filmography===
== Other work ==
In 1997, he published a book, &quot;Marcus Schenkenberg: New Rules&quot;, which featured numerous photos and personal notes and comments on his modeling career, as well as contributions from colleagues, family members and people in the fashion and modeling business.

In 1999, he was asked by a friend to record a song, which was meant for fun but was followed by a contract with EMI. &quot;La Chica Marita&quot; was produced by Tony Catania and was also released on the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Flawless&quot; with Robert De Niro. Schenkenberg described the work on the song and video as good experience, but he remained more interested in acting.

==Personal life==

Schenkenberg lives in New York and Los Angeles and also has an apartment in Stockholm. He is fluent in five languages: Swedish, English, Dutch, French and Italian and understands German.

During the early nineties he had relationships with the models Maureen Gallegher, Catherine Hardenborg and Rosemarie Wetzel. Schenkenberg dated various prominent women during the following years, including Mariah Carey, Nicky Hilton, Niki Köhler, Victoria Silvstedt and Jessica Simpson. His relationship with Pamela Anderson between 2000 and 2001 made him more well-known to the public aside from his modelling.

<doc id="362565" wikidata="Q1971426" url="?curid=362565" title="Optimal control">
<text>Optimal control theory is a branch of control theory that deals with finding a control for a dynamical system over a period of time such that an objective function is optimized. It has numerous applications in science, engineering and operations research. For example, the dynamical system might be a spacecraft with controls corresponding to rocket thrusters, and the objective might be to reach the Moon with minimum fuel expenditure. Or the dynamical system could be a nation&#x27;s economy, with the objective to minimize unemployment; the controls in this case could be fiscal and monetary policy. A dynamical system may also be introduced to embed operations research problems within the framework of optimal control theory.

Optimal control is an extension of the calculus of variations, and is a mathematical optimization method for deriving control policies. The method is largely due to the work of Lev Pontryagin and Richard Bellman in the 1950s, after contributions to calculus of variations by Edward J. McShane. Optimal control can be seen as a control strategy in control theory.

==General method==
Optimal control deals with the problem of finding a control law for a given system such that a certain optimality criterion is achieved. A control problem includes a cost functional that is a function of state and control variables. An optimal control is a set of differential equations describing the paths of the control variables that minimize the cost function. The optimal control can be derived using Pontryagin&#x27;s maximum principle (a necessary condition also known as Pontryagin&#x27;s minimum principle or simply Pontryagin&#x27;s principle), or by solving the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation (a sufficient condition).

We begin with a simple example. Consider a car traveling in a straight line on a hilly road. The question is, how should the driver press the accelerator pedal in order to &quot;minimize&quot; the total traveling time? In this example, the term &quot;control law&quot; refers specifically to the way in which the driver presses the accelerator and shifts the gears. The &quot;system&quot; consists of both the car and the road, and the &quot;optimality criterion&quot; is the minimization of the total traveling time. Control problems usually include ancillary constraints. For example, the amount of available fuel might be limited, the accelerator pedal cannot be pushed through the floor of the car, speed limits, etc.

A proper cost function will be a mathematical expression giving the traveling time as a function of the speed, geometrical considerations, and initial conditions of the system. Constraints are often interchangeable with the cost function.

Another related optimal control problem may be to find the way to drive the car so as to minimize its fuel consumption, given that it must complete a given course in a time not exceeding some amount. Yet another related control problem may be to minimize the total monetary cost of completing the trip, given assumed monetary prices for time and fuel.

A more abstract framework goes as follows. Minimize the continuous-time cost functional
formula_1
subject to the first-order dynamic constraints (the state equation)
formula_2
the algebraic &quot;path constraints&quot;
formula_3
and the endpoint conditions
formula_4
where formula_5 is the &quot;state&quot;, formula_6 is the &quot;control&quot;, formula_7 is the independent variable (generally speaking, time), formula_8 is the initial time, and formula_9 is the terminal time. The terms formula_10 and formula_11 are called the &quot;endpoint cost &quot; and the &quot;running cost&quot; respectively. In the calculus of variations, formula_10 and formula_11 are referred to as the Mayer term and the &quot;Lagrangian&quot;, respectively. Furthermore, it is noted that the path constraints are in general &quot;inequality&quot; constraints and thus may not be active (i.e., equal to zero) at the optimal solution. It is also noted that the optimal control problem as stated above may have multiple solutions (i.e., the solution may not be unique). Thus, it is most often the case that any solution formula_14 to the optimal control problem is &quot;locally minimizing&quot;.

==Linear quadratic control==
A special case of the general nonlinear optimal control problem given in the previous section is the &quot;linear quadratic&quot; (LQ) optimal control problem. The LQ problem is stated as follows. Minimize the &quot;quadratic&quot; continuous-time cost functional
formula_15

Subject to the &quot;linear&quot; first-order dynamic constraints
formula_16
and the initial condition
formula_17

A particular form of the LQ problem that arises in many control system problems is that of the &quot;linear quadratic regulator&quot; (LQR) where all of the matrices (i.e., formula_18, formula_19, formula_20, and formula_21) are &quot;constant&quot;, the initial time is arbitrarily set to zero, and the terminal time is taken in the limit formula_22 (this last assumption is what is known as &quot;infinite horizon&quot;). The LQR problem is stated as follows. Minimize the infinite horizon quadratic continuous-time cost functional
formula_23

Subject to the &quot;linear time-invariant&quot; first-order dynamic constraints
formula_24
and the initial condition
formula_17

In the finite-horizon case the matrices are restricted in that formula_20 and formula_21 are positive semi-definite and positive definite, respectively. In the infinite-horizon case, however, the matrices formula_20 and formula_21 are not only positive-semidefinite and positive-definite, respectively, but are also &quot;constant&quot;. These additional restrictions on
formula_20 and formula_21 in the infinite-horizon case are enforced to ensure that the cost functional remains positive. Furthermore, in order to ensure that the cost function is &quot;bounded&quot;, the additional restriction is imposed that the pair formula_32 is &quot;controllable&quot;. Note that the LQ or LQR cost functional can be thought of physically as attempting to minimize the &quot;control energy&quot; (measured as a quadratic form).

The infinite horizon problem (i.e., LQR) may seem overly restrictive and essentially useless because it assumes that the operator is driving the system to zero-state and hence driving the output of the system to zero. This is indeed correct. However the problem of driving the output to a desired nonzero level can be solved &quot;after&quot; the zero output one is. In fact, it can be proved that this secondary LQR problem can be solved in a very straightforward manner. It has been shown in classical optimal control theory that the LQ (or LQR) optimal control has the feedback form
formula_33
where formula_34 is a properly dimensioned matrix, given as
formula_35
and formula_36 is the solution of the differential Riccati equation. The differential Riccati equation is given as
formula_37

For the finite horizon LQ problem, the Riccati equation is integrated backward in time using the terminal boundary condition
formula_38

For the infinite horizon LQR problem, the differential Riccati equation is replaced with the &quot;algebraic&quot; Riccati equation (ARE) given as
formula_39

Understanding that the ARE arises from infinite horizon problem, the matrices formula_18, formula_19, formula_20, and formula_21 are all &quot;constant&quot;. It is noted that there are in general multiple solutions to the algebraic Riccati equation and the &quot;positive definite&quot; (or positive semi-definite) solution is the one that is used to compute the feedback gain. The LQ (LQR) problem was elegantly solved by Rudolf E. Kálmán.

==Numerical methods for optimal control==
Optimal control problems are generally nonlinear and therefore, generally do not have analytic solutions (e.g., like the linear-quadratic optimal control problem). As a result, it is necessary to employ numerical methods to solve optimal control problems. In the early years of optimal control ( 1950s to 1980s) the favored approach for solving optimal control problems was that of &quot;indirect methods&quot;. In an indirect method, the calculus of variations is employed to obtain the first-order optimality conditions. These conditions result in a two-point (or, in the case of a complex problem, a multi-point) boundary-value problem. This boundary-value problem actually has a special structure because it arises from taking the derivative of a Hamiltonian. Thus, the resulting dynamical system is a Hamiltonian system of the form
formula_44
where
formula_45
is the &quot;augmented Hamiltonian&quot; and in an indirect method, the boundary-value problem is solved (using the appropriate boundary or &quot;transversality&quot; conditions). The beauty of using an indirect method is that the state and adjoint (i.e., formula_46) are solved for and the resulting solution is readily verified to be an extremal trajectory. The disadvantage of indirect methods is that the boundary-value problem is often extremely difficult to solve (particularly for problems that span large time intervals or problems with interior point constraints). A well-known software program that implements indirect methods is BNDSCO.

The approach that has risen to prominence in numerical optimal control since the 1980s is that of so-called &quot;direct methods&quot;. In a direct method, the state or the control, or both, are approximated using an appropriate function approximation (e.g., polynomial approximation or piecewise constant parameterization). Simultaneously, the cost functional is approximated as a &quot;cost function&quot;. Then, the coefficients of the function approximations are treated as optimization variables and the problem is &quot;transcribed&quot; to a nonlinear optimization problem of the form:

Minimize
formula_47
subject to the algebraic constraints
formula_48

Depending upon the type of direct method employed, the size of the nonlinear optimization problem can be quite small (e.g., as in a direct shooting or quasilinearization method), moderate (e.g. pseudospectral optimal control) or may be quite large (e.g., a direct collocation method). In the latter case (i.e., a collocation method), the nonlinear optimization problem may be literally thousands to tens of thousands of variables and constraints. Given the size of many NLPs arising from a direct method, it may appear somewhat counter-intuitive that solving the nonlinear optimization problem is easier than solving the boundary-value problem. It is, however, the fact that the NLP is easier to solve than the boundary-value problem. The reason for the relative ease of computation, particularly of a direct collocation method, is that the NLP is &quot;sparse&quot; and many well-known software programs exist (e.g., SNOPT) to solve large sparse NLPs. As a result, the range of problems that can be solved via direct methods (particularly direct &quot;collocation methods&quot; which are very popular these days) is significantly larger than the range of problems that can be solved via indirect methods. In fact, direct methods have become so popular these days that many people have written elaborate software programs that employ these methods. In particular, many such programs include &quot;DIRCOL&quot;, SOCS, OTIS, GESOP/ASTOS, DITAN. and PyGMO/PyKEP. In recent years, due to the advent of the MATLAB programming language, optimal control software in MATLAB has become more common. Examples of academically developed MATLAB software tools implementing direct methods include &quot;RIOTS&quot;, &quot;DIDO&quot;, &quot;DIRECT&quot;, FALCON.m, and &quot;GPOPS,&quot; while an example of an industry developed MATLAB tool is &quot;PROPT&quot;. These software tools have increased significantly the opportunity for people to explore complex optimal control problems both for academic research and industrial problems. Finally, it is noted that general-purpose MATLAB optimization environments such as TOMLAB have made coding complex optimal control problems significantly easier than was previously possible in languages such as C and FORTRAN.

==Discrete-time optimal control==
The examples thus far have shown continuous time systems and control solutions. In fact, as optimal control solutions are now often implemented digitally, contemporary control theory is now primarily concerned with discrete time systems and solutions. The Theory of Consistent Approximations provides conditions under which solutions to a series of increasingly accurate discretized optimal control problem converge to the solution of the original, continuous-time problem. Not all discretization methods have this property, even seemingly obvious ones. For instance, using a variable step-size routine to integrate the problem&#x27;s dynamic equations may generate a gradient which does not converge to zero (or point in the right direction) as the solution is approached. The direct method &quot;RIOTS&quot; is based on the Theory of Consistent Approximation.

==Examples==

A common solution strategy in many optimal control problems is to solve for the costate (sometimes called the shadow price) formula_49. The costate summarizes in one number the marginal value of expanding or contracting the state variable next turn. The marginal value is not only the gains accruing to it next turn but associated with the duration of the program. It is nice when formula_49 can be solved analytically, but usually, the most one can do is describe it sufficiently well that the intuition can grasp the character of the solution and an equation solver can solve numerically for the values.

Having obtained formula_49, the turn-t optimal value for the control can usually be solved as a differential equation conditional on knowledge of formula_49. Again it is infrequent, especially in continuous-time problems, that one obtains the value of the control or the state explicitly. Usually, the strategy is to solve for thresholds and regions that characterize the optimal control and use a numerical solver to isolate the actual choice values in time.

===Finite time===

Consider the problem of a mine owner who must decide at what rate to extract ore from their mine. They own rights to the ore from date formula_53 to date formula_54. At date formula_53 there is formula_56 ore in the ground, and the time-dependent amount of ore formula_57 left in the ground declines at the rate of formula_58 that the mine owner extracts it. The mine owner extracts ore at cost formula_59 (the cost of extraction increasing with the square of the extraction speed and the inverse of the amount of ore left) and sells ore at a constant price formula_60. Any ore left in the ground at time formula_54 cannot be sold and has no value (there is no &quot;scrap value&quot;). The owner chooses the rate of extraction varying with time formula_58 to maximize profits over the period of ownership with no time discounting.

{2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and using the initial and turn-T conditions, the formula_63 series can be solved explicitly, giving formula_64.

| 2 = Continuous-time version

The manager maximizes profit formula_65:
formula_66
where the state variable formula_57 evolves as follows:
formula_68

Form the Hamiltonian and differentiate:
formula_69

As the mine owner does not value the ore remaining at time formula_54,
formula_71

Using the above equations, it is easy to solve for the differential equations governing formula_58 and formula_49
formula_74
and using the initial and turn-T conditions, the functions can be solved to yield
formula_75

<doc id="362570" wikidata="Q5474382" url="?curid=362570" title="Foundation degree">
<text>A foundation degree is a combined academic and vocational qualification in higher education in the United Kingdom, equivalent to two-thirds of an honours bachelor&#x27;s degree. Foundation degrees were introduced by the Department for Education and Employment in 2000. They are available in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and offered by universities, colleges with their own foundation degree awarding powers, and colleges and employers running courses validated by universities.

Foundation degrees must include a pathway for graduates to progress to an honours degree. This may be via joining the final year of a standard three-year course or through a dedicated &#x27;top-up&#x27; course. Students can also transfer to other institutions to take a top-up course or the final year of an honours course. It may also be possible for students to join the second year of an honours course in a different but related subject.

==History==
The need for intermediate higher education qualifications that combined vocational and academic elements was recognised in the &quot;Choosing to Change&quot; report in 1994 and by the Dearing Report in 1997, while the 1999 &quot;Delivering Skills for All&quot; report recommended the establishment of two-year vocational associate degrees. They were trialled in 2000, at which point the government expected 80% of the future expansion in higher education to come from foundation degrees. Foundation degrees were formally launched in 2001 and the first students enrolled at the start of the 2001/2 academic year.

Foundation degrees expanded initially, particularly taking market share from other sub-degree qualifications such as Higher National Diplomas, but overall enrollments have declined since 2009. Although the number of students studying foundation degrees at colleges has continued to increase, this has not been sufficient to offset the fall in university courses. This has been blamed on a number of factors such as the introduction, in 2009, of student number controls. This limited the number of students that universities could recruit in a year, rather than the total number on courses. The Foundation Degree Forward quango, which had been set up to promote foundation degrees, closed in 2011.

==Status==
Foundation degrees are not general degrees but are focused on specific professions. There are no generally-set entry conditions: commercial or industrial experience may be more important in gaining a place than formal qualifications, and experience is always taken into account. They are intended to give comprehensive knowledge in a subject to enable the holder to go on to employment or further study in that field. They are normally offered by universities and further education colleges working in partnership. They are also offered by some companies (in partnership with an awarding body) as training for employees, e.g. McDonald&#x27;s in partnership with Manchester Metropolitan University.

Foundation degrees are at Level 5 in the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications, below bachelor&#x27;s degrees at level 6. Courses are typically two years full-time study or longer part-time, and it is often possible to &#x27;top up&#x27; to a bachelor&#x27;s degree with a further year of study. They are at the same level as the older Higher National Diploma (HND) and Diploma of Higher Education (DipHE); however, they have a different emphasis and can only be awarded by institutions that have received research, taught or foundation degree awarding powers from the Privy Council.

According to figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency, over half of foundation degree graduates are in further study six months after graduating, many presumably &#x27;topping up&#x27; to a bachelor&#x27;s degree, and more than 60% are in employment (there is an overlap of slightly over 20% who are both working and studying). Less than 2.5% of foundation degree holders are unemployed six months after graduating.

Further education colleges who wish to award their own foundation degrees must apply to the Office for Students for degree awarding powers.

<text>The Australian Republic Movement (ARM) is a non-partisan organisation campaigning for Australia to become a republic. The ARM and its supporters have promoted various models, including a parliamentary republic, and the organisation has branches active in all states and territories.

==History==
===Foundation===
The ARM was founded on 7 July 1991 and was originally known as the Australian Republican Movement. Its first chairman was novelist Thomas Keneally, with other founding members including lawyer Malcolm Turnbull (later Prime Minister), former Australian cricket captain Ian Chappell, film director Fred Schepisi, and author, journalist, and radio and television presenter Peter FitzSimons.

Following FitzSimons&#x27; retirement as chair, Australian retired Socceroo and human rights advocate Craig Foster and former Olympian and politician Nova Peris were elected co-chairs. In May 2024, co-chairs Peris and Foster both resigned because of their differing responses to the war in Gaza. Arts and cultural leader Esther Anatolitis and management consultant Nathan Hansford were subsequently elected co-chairs.

===1999 referendum===
The Australian republic referendum, held on 6 November 1999, was a two-question referendum to amend the Constitution of Australia. For some years opinion polls had suggested that a majority of the electorate favoured a republic. Nonetheless, the 1999 referendum was defeated due to a range of factors, including a lack of bi-partisanship and division among republicans on the method proposed for selection of the president.

===Australian Choice Model===
The ARM announced their proposed model for a republic on 13 January 2022, the Australian Choice Model. The model would entail a process where the State and Territory Parliaments each nominate one candidate to be the head of state, and the Federal Parliament nominates up to three candidates. The list of these candidates would then be put to a vote where the public would elect their preferred candidate and would serve for a five-year term. A majority of ARM members voted to support the policy, however the policy announcement raised concerns and criticisms from the Australian Monarchist League, as well as other republicans, including former prime minister Paul Keating and former New South Wales Premier Bob Carr. Critics such as Carr claim that a head of state who is elected by the public could cause conflict with a prime minister and Parliament. Then-ARM Chair Peter FitzSimons argued against these criticisms, noting that the head of state&#x27;s powers would be limited and they would be unable to dismiss a prime minister.

<doc id="362594" wikidata="Q10448" url="?curid=362594" title="Hercules (constellation)">
<text>Hercules is a star named after Hercules, the Roman mythology hero adapted from the Greek hero Heracles. Hercules was one of the 48 constellations listed by the second-century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations today. It is the fifth-largest of the modern constellations and is the largest of the 50 which have no stars brighter than apparent magnitude +2.5.

==Characteristics==

Hercules is bordered by Draco to the north; Boötes, Corona Borealis, and Serpens Caput to the west; Ophiuchus to the south; Aquila to the southwest; and Sagitta, Vulpecula, and Lyra to the east. Covering 1225.1 square degrees and 2.970% of the night sky, it ranks fifth among the 88 constellations in size. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is &#x27;Her&#x27;. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 32 segments (&quot;illustrated in infobox&quot;). In the equatorial coordinate system, epoch 2000, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between +3.67° and +51.32°. In mid-northern latitudes, Hercules is best observed from mid-spring until early autumn, culminating at midnight on June 13.

The solar apex is the direction of the open motion with respect to the Local Standard of Rest. This is located within the constellation of Hercules, around coordinates right ascension and declination . The north pole of the supergalactic coordinate system is located within this constellation at right ascension and declination .

==Stars==
Hercules has no first or second magnitude stars. However, it does have several stars above magnitude 4. Alpha Herculis, traditionally called Rasalgethi, is a triple star system, partly resolvable in small amateur telescopes, 359 light-years from Earth. Its common name means &quot;the kneeler&#x27;s head&quot;. The primary is an irregular variable star; it is a bright giant with a minimum magnitude of 4 and a maximum magnitude of 3. It has a diameter of roughly 400 solar diameters. The secondary, a spectroscopic binary that orbits the primary every 3600 years, is a blue-green hued star of magnitude 5.6. Beta Herculis, also called Kornephoros, is the brightest star in Hercules. It is a yellow giant of magnitude 2.8, 148 light-years from Earth; kornephoros means club-bearer. Delta Herculis A is a double star divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a blue-white star of magnitude 3.1, and is 78 light-years from Earth. The optical companion is of magnitude 8.2. Gamma Herculis is also a double star divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a white giant of magnitude 3.8, 195 light-years from Earth. The optical companion, widely separated, is 10th magnitude. Zeta Herculis is a binary star that is becoming divisible in medium-aperture amateur telescopes, as the components widen to their peak in 2025. The system, 35 light-years from Earth, has a period of 34.5 years. The primary is a yellow-tinged star of magnitude 2.9 and the secondary is an orange star of magnitude 5.7.

Hercules hosts further quite bright double stars and binary stars. Kappa Herculis is a double star divisible in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a yellow giant of magnitude 5.0, 388 light-years from Earth; the secondary is an orange giant of magnitude 6.3, 470 light-years from Earth. Rho Herculis is a binary star 402 light-years from Earth, divisible in small amateur telescopes. Both components are blue-green giant stars; the primary is magnitude 4.5 and the secondary is magnitude 5.5. 95 Herculis is a binary star divisible in small telescopes, 470 light-years from Earth. The primary is a silvery giant of magnitude 4.9, and the secondary is an old, reddish giant star of magnitude 5.2. The star HD164669 near the primary may be an optical double. 100 Herculis is a double star easily divisible in small amateur telescopes. Both components are magnitude 5.8 blue-white stars; they are 165 and 230 light-years from Earth.

There are several dimmer variable stars in Hercules. 30 Herculis, also called g Herculis, is a semiregular red giant with a period of 3 months. 361 light-years from Earth, it has a minimum magnitude of 6.3 and a maximum magnitude of 4.3. 68 Herculis, also called u Herculis, is a Beta Lyrae-type eclipsing binary star. 865 light-years from Earth, it has a period of 2 days; its minimum magnitude is 5.4 and its maximum magnitude is 4.7.

Mu Herculis is 27.4 light-years from Earth. The solar apex, i.e., the point on the sky which marks the direction that the Sun is moving in its orbit around the center of the Milky Way, narrowly figures in Hercules, between Hercules&#x27; left elbow (near Omicron Herculis) and Vega (in neighboring Lyra).

==Planetary systems==

Fifteen stars in Hercules are known to be orbited by extrasolar planets.
* 14 Herculis has two planets. The planet 14 Herculis b had the longest period (4.9 years) and widest orbit (2.8 AU) at the time of discovery. The planet 14 Herculis c orbits much further out with very low eccentricity. It was discovered in 2005 but was only confirmed in 2021.
* HD 149026 has a transiting hot Jupiter planet.
* HD 154345 has the planet HD 154345 b, a long period (9.095 years) and wide orbit (4.18 AU).
* HD 164922 has the first long period Saturn-like planet discovered. The mass is 0.36 MJ and semimajor axis of 2.11 AU. More planets have been discovered since.
* HD 147506 has the most massive transiting planet HAT-P-2b at the time of discovery. The mass is 8.65 MJ.
* HD 155358 has two planets around the lowest metallicity planet-harboring star (21% Sun). Both planets orbit in mild eccentricities.
* GSC 03089-00929 has a short transiting planet TrES-3b. The period was 31 hours.
* Gliese 649 has a saturnian planet around the red dwarf star.
* HD 156668 has an Earth mass planet with a minimum mass of four Earth masses.
* HD 164595 is a G-type star with one known planet, HD 164595 b.
* TOI-561 has four, or possibly five planets. The innermost of which, TOI-561 b, is notable because it is an ultra-short period planet.

==Deep-sky objects==

Hercules contains two bright globular clusters: M13, the brightest globular cluster in the northern hemisphere, and M92. It also contains the nearly spherical planetary nebula Abell 39. M13 lies between the stars η Her and ζ Her; it is dim, but may be detected by the unaided eye on a very clear night.

M13, visible to both the naked eye and binoculars, is a globular cluster of the 6th magnitude that contains more than 300,000 stars and is 25,200 light-years from Earth. It is also very large, with an apparent diameter of over 0.25 degrees, half the size of the full moon; its physical diameter is more than 100 light-years. Individual stars in M13 are resolvable in a small amateur telescope.

M92 is a globular cluster of magnitude 6.4, 26,000 light-years from earth. It is a Shapley class IV cluster, indicating that it is quite concentrated at the center; it has a very clear nucleus. M92 is visible as a fuzzy star in binoculars, like M13; it is denser and smaller than the more celebrated cluster. The oldest globular cluster known at 14 billion years, its stars are resolvable in a medium-aperture amateur telescope.

NGC 6229 is a dimmer globular cluster, with a magnitude of 9.4, it is the third-brightest globular in the constellation. 100,000 light-years from Earth, it is a Shapley class IV cluster, meaning that it is fairly rich in the center and quite concentrated at the nucleus.

NGC 6210 is a planetary nebula of the 9th magnitude, 4000 light-years from Earth visible as a blue-green elliptical disk in amateur telescopes larger than 75 mm in aperture.

AT2018cow, a large astronomical explosion detected on 16 June 2018. As of 22 June 2018, this astronomical event has generated a very large amount of interest among astronomers throughout the world and may be, as of 22 June 2018, considered a supernova tentatively named Supernova 2018cow.

The Hercules Cluster (Abell 2151) is a cluster of galaxies in Hercules.

The brightest radio source in the constellation is Hercules A, an elliptical galaxy located 2.1 billion light years away with a supermassive black hole with a mass of 2.5-billion-solar-mass that has radio jets that extend for one-and-a-half million light-years. Another bright radio source in Hercules is the quasar 3C 345 which has a jet that appears to move faster than the speed of light.

The Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall, the largest structure in the universe, is in Hercules.

==Visualizations==

===Traditional===

The traditional visualization imagines α Herculis as Hercules&#x27;s head; its name, Rasalgethi, literally means &quot;head of the kneeling one&quot;. Hercules&#x27;s left hand then points toward Lyra from his shoulder (δ Herculis), and β Herculis, or Kornephoros (&quot;club-bearer&quot;) forms his other shoulder. His narrow waist is formed by ε Herculis and ζ Herculis. His right leg is kneeling. Finally, his left leg (with θ Herculis as the knee and ι Herculis the foot) is stepping on Draco&#x27;s head, the dragon/snake whom Hercules has vanquished and perpetually gloats over for eternities.

=== Keystone asterism ===
A common form found in modern star charts uses the quadrangle formed by π Her, η Her, ζ Her and ε Her (known as the &quot;Keystone&quot; asterism) as the lower half (abdomen) of Hercules&#x27;s torso.

===H.A. Rey===
H. A. Rey has suggested an alternative visualization in which the &quot;Keystone&quot; becomes Hercules&#x27;s head. This quadrangle lies between two very bright stars: Vega in the constellation Lyra and α CrB (Alphecca) in the constellation Corona Borealis. The hero&#x27;s right leg contains two bright stars of the third magnitude: α Her (Rasalgethi) and δ Her (Sarin). The latter is the right knee. The hero&#x27;s left leg contains dimmer stars of the fourth magnitude which do not have Bayer designations but which do have Flamsteed numbers. The star β Her belongs to the hero&#x27;s outstretched right hand, and is also called Kornephoros.

==History==
According to Gavin White, the Greek constellation of Hercules is a distorted version of the Babylonian constellation known as the &quot;Standing Gods&quot; (MUL.DINGIR.GUB.BA.MESH). White argues that this figure was, like the similarly named &quot;Sitting Gods&quot;, depicted as a man with a serpent&#x27;s body instead of legs (the serpent element now being represented on the Greek star map by the figure of Draco that Hercules crushes beneath his feet). He further argues that the original name of Hercules – the &#x27;Kneeler&#x27; (see below) – is a conflation of the two Babylonian constellations of the Sitting and Standing Gods.

The constellation is also sometimes associated with Gilgamesh, a Sumerian mythological hero. Phoenician tradition is said to have associated this constellation with their sun god, who slew a dragon (Draco).

The earliest Greek references to the constellation do not refer to it as Hercules. Aratus describes it as follows:
Right there in its [Draco&#x27;s] orbit wheels a Phantom form, like to a man that strives at a task. That sign no man knows how to read clearly, nor what task he is bent, but men simply call him On His Knees. [ &quot;the Kneeler&quot;].

Now that Phantom, that toils on his knees, seems to sit on bended knee, and from both his shoulders his hands are upraised and stretch, one this way, one that, a fathom&#x27;s length. Over the middle of the head of the crooked Dragon, he has the tip of his right foot. Here too that Crown [Corona], which glorious Dionysus set to be memorial of the dead Ariadne, wheels beneath the back of the toil-spent Phantom. To the Phantom&#x27;s back the Crown is near, but by his head mark near at hand the head of Ophiuchus [...] Yonder, too, is the tiny Tortoise, which, while still beside his cradle, Hermes pierced for strings and bade it be called the Lyre [Lyra]: and he brought it into heaven and set it in front of the unknown Phantom. That Croucher on his Knees comes near the Lyre with his left knee, but the top of the Bird&#x27;s head wheels on the other side, and between the Bird&#x27;s head and the Phantom&#x27;s knee is enstarred the Lyre.

The constellation is connected with Hercules in (probably 1st century BCE/CE, and attributed to Hyginus), which describes several different myths about the constellation:
* Eratosthenes (3rd century BCE) is said to have described it as Hercules, placed above Draco (representing the dragon of the Hesperides) and preparing to fight it, holding his lion&#x27;s skin in his left hand, and a club in his right (this can be found in the ).
* Panyassis&#x27; (5th century BCE) reportedly said Jupiter was impressed by this fight, and made it a constellation, with Hercules kneeling on his right knee, and trying to crush Draco&#x27;s head with his left foot, while striking with his right hand and holding the lion skin in his left.
* Araethus (3rd/4th century BCE) is said to have described the constellation as depicting Ceteus son of Lycaon, imploring the gods to restore his daughter Megisto who had been transformed into a bear.
* Hegesianax (2nd/3rd century BCE), who it says describes it as Theseus lifting the stone at Troezen.
* Anacreon of Alexandria, who it claims also supports the idea that it depicts Theseus, saying that the constellation Lyra (said to be Theseus&#x27; lyre in other sources) is near Theseus.
* Thamyris blinded by the Muses, kneeling in supplication.
* Orpheus killed by the women of Thracia for seeing the sacred rituals of Liber (Dionysus).
* Aeschylus&#x27; lost play &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; (5th century BCE), which recounted that when Hercules drives the cattle of Geryon through Liguria (northern Italy), the Ligurians will join forces and attack him, attempting to steal the cattle. Hercules fights until his weapons break, before falling to his knees, wounded. Jupiter, taking pity on his son, provides many stones on the ground, which Hercules uses to fight off the Ligurians. In commemoration of this, Jupiter makes a constellation depicting Hercules in his fighting form. (A quote from this section of the play is preserved in Dionysius of Halicarnassus&#x27; &quot;Roman Antiquities&quot;: &quot;And thou shalt come to Liguria&#x27;s dauntless host, Where no fault shalt thou find, bold though thou art, With the fray: &#x27;tis fated thy missiles all shall fail.&quot;)
* Ixion with his arms bound for trying to attack Juno.
* Prometheus bound on Mount Caucasus.

The Scholia to Aratus mention three more mythical figures in connection with this constellation: Sisyphus or Tantalus, who suffered in Tartarus for having offended the gods, or Salmoneus, who was struck down by Zeus for his hubris. Another classical author associated the constellation with Atlas.

==Equivalents==
In Chinese astronomy, the stars that correspond to Hercules are located in two areas: the Purple Forbidden enclosure (紫微垣, &quot;Zǐ Wēi Yuán&quot;) and the Heavenly Market enclosure (天市垣, &quot;Tiān Shì Yuán&quot;).

Arab translators of Ptolemy named it in (not to be confused with ), the name for the star Mu Draconis.
Hence its Swahili name .

<doc id="362597" wikidata="Q7181785" url="?curid=362597" title="Phil Cleary">
<text>Philip Ronald Cleary (born 8 December 1952) is an Australian political and sport commentator. He is a former Australian rules footballer who played 205 games at the Coburg Football Club, before serving as the member for Wills in the House of Representatives from 1992 until 1996.

==Football career==
Cleary began his playing career at the Coburg Amateurs Football Club in the Victorian Amateur Football Association (VAFA) in the early 1970s. He wore number 1 at the club for the 1973 season.

He first came to notice as a prominent player and coach in Victoria&#x27;s second-level Australian rules football competition, the Victorian Football Association (VFA), for the Coburg Football Club. He debuted with the club in 1975, playing in the reserves premiersip later that season.

Cleary went onto play 205 games — second only to Dave Starbuck in Coburg club history — and kick 317 goals. He was a member of the 1979 premiership side and losing 1980 side. He coached the club between 1984 and 1992 (captain coach between 1984 and 1987, upon which he retired as a player), before leading them to back-to-back premierships in 1988–89.

In the 1986 VFA grand final against Williamstown, he was sensationally ordered off, only to be found not guilty at the tribunal. He coached the VFA representative side on five occasions without losing a game. He was one of the most well-known players in the VFA in his era, and was instantly recognisable from the thick beard he wore throughout his career.

He has had various coaching and mentoring roles in the Essendon District Football League, including at the West Coburg Football Club, where he coached the under-16s team to a premiership in 2008 and the under-18s team to a premiership in 2010. The latter side included future AFL players Brandon Ellis and Adam Saad.

==Political career==
At the Wills by-election of 11 April 1992, caused by the resignation of former Prime Minister Bob Hawke, Phil Cleary was elected as an independent to the Australian House of Representatives from a field of 22 candidates, becoming the only non-Labor member to have ever held the seat. However, his election was successfully challenged in the High Court and declared void on 25 November, as Cleary was on unpaid leave from the Victorian Education Department, and the Section 44 of the Constitution of Australia forbids people employed by the Crown from standing for election. A second by-election was not held, as a general election was expected within a few months. At the 1993 Australian federal election, Cleary again stood as a candidate and was elected for a second time.

Cleary lost the seat to Labor at the 1996 federal election. Wills had undergone a redistribution, by adding territory to the division, which weakened Cleary&#x27;s notional position against Labor. Cleary&#x27;s vote of 22.7% was a decrease of 6.7% from the 29.4% he polled in 1993, on different boundaries.

While advocating an Australian Republic, he broke with the Australian Republican Movement (ARM) over disagreement about how the President of Australia should be chosen, forming a group called &quot;Real Republic&quot;, which advocated direct election of the President as opposed to the model advocated by Malcolm Turnbull of the ARM, under which the President would be chosen by a joint sitting of the Parliament, and which was the model proposed in the 1999 referendum.

==Post-parliament==
Cleary was a part of the ABC’s telecast of VFA/VFL football as a match-day commentator from 1987 until the ABC lost the rights in 2014, juggling coaching and commentary duties for the first five seasons. He conducted interviews and acted as a boundary rider for the match of the day, writes a weekly column for the football magazine &quot;Inside Football&quot;, and regularly appears in the media on a range of social and political issues. He has campaigned to stop male violence against women since his sister was murdered by her former partner in 1987. He is a freelance journalist and public speaker and is the author of three books: &quot;Cleary Independent&quot;, &quot;Just Another Little Murder&quot;, and &quot;Getting Away with Murder&quot;.

Cleary contested the seat of Brunswick at the 2010 Victorian state election as an independent.

===Defamation incident===
In a much-published defamation case in 2010, it was alleged that, in his 2005 book &quot;Getting Away with Murder&quot;, Cleary had accused barrister Dyson Hore-Lacy of helping a man who killed his own wife to manufacture a provocation defence. Hore-Lacy won the case and was awarded $630,000 in damages.

<doc id="362598" wikidata="Q417718" url="?curid=362598" title="Indium tin oxide">
<text>Indium tin oxide (ITO) is a ternary composition of indium, tin and oxygen in varying proportions. Depending on the oxygen content, it can be described as either a ceramic or an alloy. Indium tin oxide is typically encountered as an oxygen-saturated composition with a formulation of 74% In, 8% Sn, and 18% O by weight. Oxygen-saturated compositions are so typical that unsaturated compositions are termed &quot;oxygen-deficient ITO&quot;. It is transparent and colorless in thin layers, while in bulk form it is yellowish to gray. In the infrared region of the spectrum it acts as a metal-like mirror.

Indium tin oxide is one of the most widely used transparent conducting oxides, not just for its electrical conductivity and optical transparency, but also for the ease with which it can be deposited as a thin film, as well as its chemical resistance to moisture. As with all transparent conducting films, a compromise must be made between conductivity and transparency, since increasing the thickness and increasing the concentration of charge carriers increases the film&#x27;s conductivity, but decreases its transparency.

Thin films of indium tin oxide are most commonly deposited on surfaces by physical vapor deposition. Often used is electron beam evaporation, or a range of sputter deposition techniques.

==Material and properties==

ITO is a mixed oxide of indium and tin with a melting point in the range 1526–1926 °C (1800–2200 K, 2800–3500 °F), depending on composition. The most commonly used material is an oxide of a composition of ca. In4Sn. The material is a n-type semiconductor with a large bandgap of around 4 eV. ITO is both transparent to visible light and relatively conductive. It has a low electrical resistivity of ~10−4 Ω·cm, and a thin film can have an optical transmittance of greater than 80%. These properties are utilized to great advantage in touch-screen applications such as mobile phones.

==Common uses==
Indium tin oxide (ITO) is an optoelectronic material that is applied widely in both research and industry. ITO can be used for many applications, such as flat-panel displays, smart windows, polymer-based electronics, thin film photovoltaics, glass doors of supermarket freezers, and architectural windows. Moreover, ITO thin films for glass substrates can be helpful for glass windows to conserve energy.

ITO green tapes are utilized for the production of lamps that are electroluminescent, functional, and fully flexible. Also, ITO thin films are used primarily to serve as coatings that are anti-reflective and for liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and electroluminescence, where the thin films are used as conducting, transparent electrodes.

ITO is often used to make transparent conductive coating for displays such as liquid crystal displays, OLED displays, plasma displays, touch panels, and electronic ink applications. Thin films of ITO are also used in organic light-emitting diodes, solar cells, antistatic coatings and EMI shieldings. In organic light-emitting diodes, ITO is used as the anode (hole injection layer).

ITO films deposited on windshields are used for defrosting aircraft windshields. The heat is generated by applying a voltage across the film. ITO is also used to reflect electromagnetic radiation. The F-22 Raptor&#x27;s canopy has an ITO coating that reflects radar waves, enhancing its stealth capabilities and giving it a distinctive gold tint.

ITO is also used for various optical coatings, most notably infrared-reflecting coatings (hot mirrors) for automotive, and sodium vapor lamp glasses. Other uses include gas sensors, antireflection coatings, electrowetting on dielectrics, and Bragg reflectors for VCSEL lasers. ITO is also used as the IR reflector for low-e window panes. ITO was also used as a sensor coating in the later Kodak DCS cameras, starting with the Kodak DCS 520, as a means of increasing blue channel response.

ITO thin film strain gauges can operate at temperatures up to 1400 °C and can be used in harsh environments, such as gas turbines, jet engines, and rocket engines.

=== Silver nanoparticle–ITO hybrid ===

ITO has been popularly used as a high-quality flexible substrate to produce flexible electronics. However, this substrate&#x27;s flexibility decreases as its conductivity improves. Previous research have indicated that the mechanical properties of ITO can be improved through increasing the degree of crystallinity. Doping with silver (Ag) can improve this property, but results in a loss of transparency. An improved method that embeds Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) instead of homogeneously to create a hybrid ITO has proven to be effective in compensating for the decrease in transparency. The hybrid ITO consists of domains in one orientation grown on the AgNPs and a matrix of the other orientation. The domains are stronger than the matrix and function as barriers to crack propagation, significantly increasing the flexibility. The change in resistivity with increased bending significantly decreases in the hybrid ITO compared with homogeneous ITO.

==Alternative synthesis methods==
ITO is typically deposited through expensive and energy-intensive processes that deal with physical vapor deposition (PVD). Such processes include sputtering, which results in the formation of brittle layers. 
Because of the cost and energy of physical vapor deposition, with the required vacuum processing, alternative methods of preparing ITO are being investigated. 

===Tape casting process===
An alternative process that uses a particle-based technique, is known as the tape casting process. Because it is a particle-based technique, the ITO nano-particles are dispersed first, then placed in organic solvents for stability. Benzyl phthalate plasticizer and polyvinyl butyral binder have been shown to be helpful in preparing nanoparticle slurries. Once the tape casting process has been carried out, the characterization of the green ITO tapes showed that optimal transmission went up to about 75%, with a lower bound on the electrical resistance of 2 Ω·cm.

===Laser sintering===
Using ITO nanoparticles imposes a limit on the choice of substrate, owing to the high temperature required for sintering. As an alternative starting material, In-Sn alloy nanoparticles allow for a more diverse range of possible substrates. A continuous conductive In-Sn alloy film is formed firstly, followed by oxidation to bring transparency. This two step process involves thermal annealing, which requires special atmosphere control and increased processing time. Because metal nanoparticles can be converted easily into a conductive metal film under the treatment of laser, laser sintering is applied to achieve products&#x27; homogeneous morphology. Laser sintering is also easy and less costly to use since it can be performed in air.

===Ambient gas conditions===
For example, using conventional methods but varying the ambient gas conditions to improve the optoelectronic properties as, for example, oxygen plays a major role in the properties of ITO.

===Chemical shaving for very thin films===
There has been numerical modeling of plasmonic metallic nanostructures have shown great potential as a method of light management in thin-film nanodisc-patterned hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) solar photovoltaic (PV) cells. A problem that arises for plasmonic-enhanced PV devices is the requirement for &#x27;ultra-thin&#x27; transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) with high transmittance and low enough resistivity to be used as device top contacts/electrodes. Unfortunately, most work on TCOs is on relatively thick layers and the few reported cases of thin TCO showed a marked decrease in conductivity. To overcome this it is possible to first grow a thick layer and then chemically shave it down to obtain a thin layer that is whole and highly conductive.

==Constraints and trade-offs==

A major concern with ITO is its cost. ITO costs several times more than aluminium zinc oxide (AZO). AZO is a common choice of transparent conducting oxide (TCO) because of its lower cost and relatively good optical transmission performance in the solar spectrum. However, ITO is superior to AZO in many other important performance categories including chemical resistance to moisture. ITO is not affected by moisture, and is stable as part of copper indium gallium selenide solar cell for 25–30 years on a rooftop.

While the sputtering target or evaporative material that is used to deposit the ITO is significantly more costly than AZO, the amount of material placed on each cell is quite small. Therefore, the cost penalty per cell is quite small, too.

==Benefits==

The primary advantage of ITO compared to AZO as a transparent conductor for LCDs is that ITO can be precisely etched into fine patterns. AZO cannot be etched as precisely: It is so sensitive to acid that it tends to get over-etched by an acid treatment.

Another benefit of ITO compared to AZO is that if moisture does penetrate, ITO will degrade less than AZO.

The role of ITO glass as a cell culture substrate can be extended easily, which opens up new opportunities for studies on growing cells involving electron microscopy and correlative light.

==Research examples==
ITO can be used in nanotechnology to provide a path to a new generation of solar cells. Solar cells made with these devices have the potential to provide low-cost, ultra-lightweight, and flexible cells with a wide range of applications. Because of the nanoscale dimensions of the nanorods, quantum-size effects influence their optical properties. By tailoring the size of the rods, they can be made to absorb light within a specific narrow band of colors. By stacking several cells with different sized rods, a broad range of wavelengths across the solar spectrum can be collected and converted to energy. Moreover, the nanoscale volume of the rods leads to a significant reduction in the amount of semiconductor material needed compared to a conventional cell. Recent studies demonstrated that nanostructured ITO can behave as a miniaturized photocapacitor, combining in a unique material the absorption and storage of light energy.

== Health and safety ==
Inhalation of indium tin oxide may cause mild irritation to the respiratory tracts and should be avoided. If exposure is long-term, symptoms may become chronic and result in benign pneumoconiosis. Studies with animals indicate that indium tin oxide is toxic when ingested, along with negative effects on the kidney, lung, and heart.

During the process of mining, production and reclamation, workers are potentially exposed to indium, especially in countries such as China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Canada and face the possibility of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema, and granulomas. Workers in the US, China, and Japan have been diagnosed with cholesterol clefts under indium exposure. Silver nanoparticles existed in improved ITOs have been found in vitro to penetrate through both intact and breached skin into the epidermal layer. Un-sintered ITOs are suspected of induce T-cell-mediated sensitization: on an intradermal exposure study, a concentration of 5% uITO resulted in lymphocyte proliferation in mice including the number increase of cells through a 10-day period.

A new occupational problem called indium lung disease was developed through contact with indium-containing dusts. The first patient is a worker associated with wet surface grinding of ITO who suffered from interstitial pneumonia: his lung was filled with ITO related particles. These particles can also induce cytokine production and macrophage dysfunction. Sintered ITOs particles alone can cause phagocytic dysfunction but not cytokine release in macrophage cells; however, they can intrigue a pro-inflammatory cytokine response in pulmonary epithelial cells. Unlike uITO, they can also bring endotoxin to workers handling the wet process if in contact with endotoxin-containing liquids. This can be attributed to the fact that sITOs have larger diameter and smaller surface area, and that this change after the sintering process can cause cytotoxicity.

Because of these issues, alternatives to ITO have been found.

== Recycling ==

The etching water used in the process of sintering ITO can only be used for a limited numbers of times before it has to be disposed. After degradation, the waste water should still contain valuable metals such as In and Cu as a secondary resource as well as Mo, Cu, Al, Sn and In, which can pose a health hazard to human beings.

==Alternative materials==
Because of high cost and limited supply of indium, the fragility and lack of flexibility of ITO layers, and the costly layer deposition requiring vacuum, alternative materials are being investigated. Promising alternatives based on zinc oxide doped with various elements.

=== Doped compounds ===

Promising alternatives based on zinc oxide doped with various elements.

Several transition metal dopants in indium oxide, particularly molybdenum, give much higher electron mobility and conductivity than obtained with tin. Doped binary compounds such as aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) and indium-doped cadmium oxide have been proposed as alternative materials. Other inorganic alternatives include aluminum, gallium or indium-doped zinc oxide (AZO, GZO or IZO).

=== Carbon nanotubes ===
Carbon nanotube conductive coatings are a prospective replacement.

=== Graphene ===
As another carbon-based alternative, films of graphene are flexible and have been shown to allow 90% transparency with a lower electrical resistance than standard ITO. Thin metal films are also seen as a potential replacement material. A hybrid material alternative currently being tested is an electrode made of silver nanowires and covered with graphene. The advantages to such materials include maintaining transparency while simultaneously being electrically conductive and flexible.

=== Conductive polymers ===
Inherently conductive polymers (ICPs) are also being developed for some ITO applications. Typically the conductivity is lower for conducting polymers, such as polyaniline and PEDOT:PSS, than for inorganic materials, but they are more flexible, less expensive and more environmentally friendly in processing and manufacture.

=== Amorphous indium–zinc oxide ===
In order to reduce indium content, decrease processing difficulty, and improve electrical homogeneity, amorphous transparent conducting oxides have been developed. One such material, amorphous indium-zinc-oxide maintains short-range order even though crystallization is disrupted by the difference in the ratio of oxygen to metal atoms between In2O3 and ZnO. Indium-zinc-oxide has some comparable properties to ITO. The amorphous structure remains stable even up to 500 °C, which allows for important processing steps common in organic solar cells. The improvement in homogeneity significantly enhances the usability of the material in the case of organic solar cells. Areas of poor electrode performance in organic solar cells render a percentage of the cell&#x27;s area unusable.

<text>Poa pratensis, commonly known as Kentucky bluegrass (or blue grass), smooth meadow-grass, or common meadow-grass, is a perennial species of grass native to practically all of Europe, North Asia and the mountains of Algeria and Morocco. There is disagreement about its native status in North America, with some sources considering it native and others stating the Spanish Empire brought the seeds of Kentucky bluegrass to the New World in mixtures with other grasses. It is a common and incredibly popular lawn grass in North America with the species being spread over all of the cool, humid parts of the United States. In its native range, &quot;Poa pratensis&quot; forms a valuable pasture plant, characteristic of well-drained, fertile soil. It is also used for making lawns in parks and gardens and has established itself as a common invasive weed across cool moist temperate climates like the Pacific Northwest and the Northeastern United States. When found on native grasslands in Canada, for example, it is considered an unwelcome exotic plant, and is indicative of a disturbed and degraded landscape.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Poa pratensis&quot; was one of the many species described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark work &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; in 1753. is Greek for fodder and &quot;pratensis&quot; is derived from , the Latin for meadow. The name Kentucky bluegrass derives from its flower heads, which are blue when the plant is allowed to grow to its natural height of .

&quot;Poa pratensis&quot; is the type species of the grass family Poaceae.

Five subspecies are accepted.
*&quot;Poa pratensis&quot; subsp. &quot;dolichophylla&quot; – Corsica
*&quot;Poa pratensis&quot; subsp. &quot;jordanii&quot; – eastern France
*&quot;Poa pratensis&quot; subsp. &quot;oligantha&quot; – western Siberia
*&quot;Poa pratensis&quot; subsp. &quot;pratensis&quot; – temperate North America and Eurasia; Yemen, the Philippines, Java, and New Guinea
*&quot;Poa pratensis&quot; subsp. &quot;turfosa&quot; – Baltic States and northern and Central European Russia

==Description==
&quot;Poa pratensis&quot; is a herbaceous perennial plant tall. The leaves have boat-shaped tips, narrowly linear, up to long and broad, smooth or slightly roughened, with a rounded to truncate ligule long. The conical panicle is long, with 3 to 5 branches in the basal whorls; the oval spikelets are long with 2 to 5 florets, and are purplish-green or grey. They are in flower from May to July, compared to annual meadowgrass (&quot;Poa annua&quot;) which is in flower for eight months of the year. &quot;Poa pratensis&quot; has a fairly prominent mid-vein (center of the blade).

The ligule is extremely short and square-ended, making a contrast with annual meadowgrass (&quot;Poa annua&quot;) and rough meadowgrass (&quot;Poa trivialis&quot;) in which it is silvery and pointed. The Kentucky bluegrass is a dark green/blue compared to the apple-green color of &quot;Poa annua&quot; and &quot;Poa trivialis&quot;.

The rootstock is creeping, with runners (rhizomes). The broad, blunt leaves tend to spread at the base, forming close mats.

==Ecology==

&quot;Poa pratensis&quot; is among the food plants of the caterpillars of the meadow brown (&quot;Maniola jurtina&quot;), gatekeeper (&quot;Pyronia tithonus&quot;), and pepper-and-salt skipper butterflies; the common sun beetle (&quot;Amara aenea&quot;) (adults feed on the developing seeds), the leafhopper &quot;Eupelix cuspidata&quot;, the grassbug &quot;Myrmus miriformis&quot; (feeds on young blades and developing seeds), and the club-horned grasshopper (&quot;Aeropedellus clavatus&quot;) (feeds on the blades, seeds, and glumes).

&quot;Poa pratensis&quot; is host to a number of fungi, including &quot;Claviceps purpurea&quot;, which causes ergotism when consumed, &quot;Drechslera poae&quot;, &quot;Epichloë typhina&quot;, &quot;Phaeoseptoria poae&quot;, &quot;Puccinia brachypodii&quot; var. &quot;poae-nemoralis&quot;, &quot;Stagonospora montagnei&quot;, &quot;Stagonospora nodorum&quot; and &quot;Wojnowicia hirta&quot;.

==Cultivation and production==
The Central Kentucky Blue Grass Seed Company Building is on the National Register of Historic Places. Since the 1950s and early 1960s, 90% of Kentucky bluegrass seed in the United States has been produced on specialist farms in Idaho, Oregon and Washington.

During the 1990s botanists began experimenting with hybrids of &quot;Poa pratensis&quot; and Texas bluegrass (&quot;P. arachnifera&quot;), with the goal of creating a drought and heat-resistant lawn grass. In warm climates, such hybrids may remain green year-round.

Bella Bluegrass is a brand-named dwarf variant of &quot;Poa pratentis&quot; developed by the University of Nebraska. It has relatively deep roots and propagates relatively rapidly horizontally from its root system but grows to only in above-ground height, basically eliminating the need for mowing lawns that use it. It cannot be reproduced by seed and thus depends on sod plugs or sprigging for its production.

<text>Samuel Slater (June 9, 1768 – April 21, 1835) was an early English-American industrialist known as the &quot;Father of the American Industrial Revolution&quot;, a phrase coined by Andrew Jackson, and the &quot;Father of the American Factory System&quot;. In the United Kingdom, he was called &quot;Slater the Traitor&quot; and &quot;Sam the Slate&quot; because he brought British textile technology to the United States, modifying it for American use. He memorized the textile factory machinery designs as an apprentice to a pioneer in the British industry before migrating to the U.S. at the age of 21. 

Slater designed the first textile mill in the U.S. He later went into business for himself, developing a family business with his sons. He eventually owned 13 spinning mills and developed tenant farms and company towns around them. One of these towns was Slatersville, Rhode Island.

==Early life and education==
Slater was born in Belper, Derbyshire, England, to William and Elizabeth Slater, on June 9, 1768, the fifth son in a farming family of eight children. He received a basic education, perhaps at a school run by Thomas Jackson. At age ten, he began work at the cotton mill opened that year by Jedediah Strutt using the water frame pioneered by Richard Arkwright at nearby Cromford Mill. In 1782, his father died, and his family indentured Samuel as an apprentice to Strutt. Slater was well trained by Strutt and, by age 21, he had gained a thorough knowledge of the organization and practice of cotton spinning.

He learned of the American interest in developing similar machines, and he was also aware of British law against exporting the designs. He memorized as much as he could, and departed for New York City in 1789. Some people of Belper called him &quot;Slater the Traitor&quot;, as they considered his move a betrayal of the town where many earned their living at Strutt&#x27;s mills.

==Career==
===Mill development===

In 1789, Rhode Island–based industrialist Moses Brown moved to Pawtucket, Rhode Island, to operate a mill in partnership with his son-in-law William Almy and cousin Smith-Brown. Almy &amp; Brown, as the company was to be called, was housed in a former fulling mill near the Pawtucket Falls of the Blackstone River. They planned to manufacture cloth for sale, with yarn to be spun on spinning wheels, jennies, and frames, using water power. 

In August 1789, they acquired a 32-spindle frame &quot;after the Arkwright pattern&quot; but could not operate it. At this point, Slater wrote to them, offering his services. Slater realized that nothing could be done with the machinery as it stood and convinced Brown of his knowledge. He promised: &quot;If I do not make a good yarn, as they do in England, I will have nothing for my services but will throw the whole of what I have attempted over the bridge.&quot; 

In 1790, he signed a contract with Brown to replicate the British designs. Their deal provided Slater the funds to build the water frames and associated machinery, with a half share in their capital value and the profits derived from them. Slater found no mechanics in the U.S. when he arrived and had great difficulty finding someone to build the machinery. Eventually he located Oziel Wilkinson and his son David to produce iron castings and forgings for the machinery. According to David Wilkinson: &quot;all the turning of the iron for the cotton machinery built by Mr. Slater was done with hand chisels or tools in lathes turned by cranks with hand power&quot;. 

By 1791 Slater had some of the equipment operating, despite shortages of tools and skilled mechanics. He was able to single-handedly construct from memory the water-powered spinning machinery. By December, the shop was operational with ten to twelve workers. In 1793, Slater and Brown opened their first factory in Pawtucket. 

Slater knew the secret of Arkwright&#x27;s success, including varying fiber lengths and Arkwright&#x27;s carding, drawing, and roving machines. He also had the experience of working with all the elements as a continuous production system. During construction, Slater made some adjustments to the designs to fit local needs. The result was the first successful water-powered roller spinning textile mill in the U.S.

After developing this mill, Slater instituted management principles that he had learned from Strutt and Arkwright to teach workers to be skilled mechanics. This included child labor similar to what existed in England.

In 1812, Slater built the Old Green Mill, later known as Cranston Print Works, in East Village in Webster, Massachusetts. He moved to Webster due in part to an available workforce, but also due to abundant water power from Webster Lake.

===Rhode Island System===
Slater created the Rhode Island System, which were factory practices based upon the closeknit family life patterns in New England villages. 

In contrast to England, where he had hired women and children, Slater recruited whole families, developing entire tenant farms and villages. He provided company-owned housing nearby, along with company stores; he sponsored a Sunday School where college students taught the children reading and writing. 

Children aged seven to 12 were the first employees of the mill; Slater personally supervised them. The first child workers were hired in 1790., it is implausible that Slater resorted to physical punishment of children, relying instead on a system of fines. Slater also brought a Sunday school system from his native England to his textile factory at Pawtucket. 

Slater constructed a new mill in 1793 for the sole purpose of textile manufacture under Almy, Brown &amp; Slater, as he was now partners with Almy and Brown. It was a 72-spindle mill; the patenting of Eli Whitney&#x27;s cotton gin in 1794 reduced the labor in processing short-staple cotton. It enabled profitable cultivation of this cotton variety, which could be grown in the interior uplands, unlike the long-staple variety of the Sea Islands and lowlands. There was a dramatic expansion of cotton cultivation throughout the Deep South in the antebellum years, especially after the 1830s Indian Removal that forced most of the Five Civilized Tribes to resettle west of the Mississippi River. The New England mills and their labor force of free men depended on southern cotton, which was based on enslaved labor by African Americans. 

In 1798, Samuel Slater split from Almy and Brown, forming Samuel Slater &amp; Company in partnership with his father-in-law Oziel Wilkinson. They developed other mills in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island.

In 1799, he was joined by his brother John Slater from England. John was a wheelwright who had spent time studying the latest English developments and might well have gained experience of the spinning mule. Samuel put John Slater in charge of a large mill called the White Mill.

By 1810, Slater held part ownership in three factories in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. In 1823, he bought a mill in Connecticut. He also built factories to make the textile manufacturing machinery used by many of the region&#x27;s mills and formed a partnership with his brother-in-law to produce iron for use in machinery construction. 

But Slater spread himself too thin and was unable to coordinate or integrate his many different business interests. He refused to go outside his family to hire managers, and, after 1829, he made his sons partners in the new umbrella firm of Samuel Slater and Sons. His son Horatio Nelson Slater completely reorganized the family business, introduced cost-cutting measures, and giving up old-fashioned procedures. 

Slater hired recruiters to search for families willing to work at the mill. He advertised to attract more families to the mills.

By 1800, the Slater mill&#x27;s success had been duplicated by other entrepreneurs. By 1810, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Albert Gallatin reported that the U.S. had some 50 cotton-yarn mills, many of them started in response to the Embargo of 1807, which cut off imports and trade with Britain before the War of 1812. That war resulted in speeding up the process of industrialization in New England. By war&#x27;s end in 1815, there were 140 cotton manufacturers within 30 miles of Providence, employing 26,000 hands and operating 130,000 spindles. The American textile industry was launched.

Slater &amp; Company became one of the leading manufacturing companies in the United States. Due to the oppressive rules and working conditions and a proposed cut of 25% in the wages of women workers in 1824 by Slater and the other Mill Owners near Pawtucket, the women resisted and conducted the first factory strike in US history. This began the long struggle for human rights between factory workers and owners, which continues today. 

Slater resisted unionization. In response to rapidly changing textile technology, he modernized his factories and later shifted operations to the South.

== Personal life ==
In 1791, Slater married Hannah Wilkinson. She invented two-ply thread in 1793, and became the first American woman to be granted a patent. Samuel and Hannah had ten children together; four died during infancy. Hannah died in 1812 from complications of childbirth, leaving Samuel with six young children to raise. 

Slater married for a second time in 1817 to a widow, Esther Parkinson. As his business was extremely successful by this time, and as Parkinson also owned the property before their marriage, the couple arranged for a pre-nuptial agreement. Along with his brother, Samuel started the Slater family in America.

==Death==

Slater died on April 21, 1835, in Webster, Massachusetts, a town which he had founded in 1832 and named for his friend Senator Daniel Webster. He is buried in Mount Zion Cemetery. At the time of his death, he owned 13 mills and was worth US$1.3 million, the equivalent in 2022 of US$42 million.

== Legacy and honors ==

Slater&#x27;s original mill still stands, known today as Slater Mill and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is operated as a museum dedicated to preserving Samuel Slater&#x27;s history and his contribution to American industry. Slater&#x27;s original mill in Pawtucket and the town of Slatersville are both parts of the Blackstone River Valley National Historical Park, which was created to preserve and interpret the history of the industrial development of the region.

His papers are held at the Harvard Business School&#x27;s Baker Library in Boston.

Samuel Slater Experience, a history museum dedicated to his life and legacy located in Webster, Massachusetts, opened in March 2022.

<doc id="362612" wikidata="Q310771" url="?curid=362612" title="Ludolph van Ceulen">
<text>Ludolph van Ceulen (, ; 28 January 1540 – 31 December 1610) was a German-Dutch mathematician from Hildesheim. He immigrated to the Netherlands.

==Biography==
Van Ceulen moved to Delft most likely in 1576 to teach fencing and mathematics and in 1594 opened a fencing school in Leiden. In 1600 he was appointed the first professor of mathematics at the Engineering School, Duytsche Mathematique, established by Maurice, Prince of Orange, at the relatively new Leiden University. He shared this professorial level at the school with the surveyor and cartographer, , which shows that the intention was to promote practical, rather than theoretical instruction.

The curriculum for the new Engineering School was devised by Simon Stevin who continued to act as the personal advisor to the Prince. At first the professors at Leiden refused to accept the status of Van Ceulen and Van Merwen, especially as they taught in Dutch rather than Latin. Theological professors generally believed that practical courses were not acceptable studies for a university, but they were not willing to reject the School outright since it was founded by Prince Maurice.

Leiden University governors heard in April 1600 that Adriaan Metius, a fortification advisor to Prince Maurice and the States General, had been recruited and raised to the level of a full professor to teach mathematics at the rival Franeker University. The Leiden governors&#x27; main problem was to match Franeker University, without raising the status too much of Duytsche Mathematique. So they quickly recruited mathematician Rudolf Snellius to the university—as distinct from the Engineering School—but then relegated him to the Faculty of Arts.

When the first degrees were to be conferred on Engineering School graduates in 1602 (under protest from the University) the governors and University&#x27;s senate refused to award them except via an examination conducted by the Universities&#x27; own mathematics professor, Rudolf Snellius—ensuring that Van Ceulen and Van Merwen were seen as inferior to the university&#x27;s own mathematician.

However Rudolf Snellius and his son Willebrord Snellius (the formulator of Snell&#x27;s law—who replaced his father) both taught mathematics at Leiden University and appear to have cooperated closely with Van Ceulen, Van Merwen, Simon Stevin and the Engineering School. Willebrord Snellius, in fact, worked closely with Stevin.

Van Ceulen died in Leiden in 1610.

== Calculating ==
Ludolph van Ceulen spent a major part of his life calculating the numerical value of the mathematical constant , using essentially the same methods as those employed by Archimedes some seventeen hundred years earlier. He published a 20-decimal value in his 1596 book &quot;Van den Circkel&quot; (&quot;On the Circle&quot;), which was published before he moved to Leiden, and he later expanded this to 35 decimals.

Van Ceulen&#x27;s 20 digits is more than enough precision for any conceivable practical purpose. Even if a circle was perfect down to the atomic scale, the thermal vibrations of the molecules of ink would make most of those digits physically meaningless. Future attempts to calculate to ever greater precision have been driven primarily by curiosity about the number itself.

== Legacy ==
After his death, the &quot;Ludolphine number&quot;,

:3.14159265358979323846264338327950288...,

was engraved on his tombstone in Leiden. The tombstone was eventually lost, but later restored in 2000.

His book &quot;De circulo &amp; adscriptis liber&quot; was translated into Latin after his death by Snellius.

In Germany, is still sometimes referred to as the &quot;Ludolphine number&quot;.

<doc id="362619" wikidata="Q900857" url="?curid=362619" title="De Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk">
<text>The de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk (or Chippie) is a tandem, two-seat, single-engined primary trainer aircraft designed and developed by Canadian aircraft manufacturer de Havilland Canada. It was developed shortly after the Second World War and sold in large numbers during the immediate post-war years, being typically employed as a replacement for the de Havilland Tiger Moth biplane.

The Chipmunk was the first postwar aviation project conducted by de Havilland Canada. It performed its maiden flight on 22 May 1946 and was introduced to operational service that same year. During the late 1940s and 1950s, the Chipmunk was procured in large numbers by military air services such as the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), Royal Air Force (RAF), and several other nations&#x27; air forces, where it was often utilised as their standard primary trainer aircraft. The type was produced under licence by de Havilland in the United Kingdom, who would produce the vast majority of Chipmunks, as well as by OGMA (&quot;Oficinas Gerais de Material Aeronáutico&quot;) in Portugal. The type was slowly phased out of service beginning in the late 1950s, although in the &quot;ab initio&quot; elementary training role, this did not happen in the Royal Air Force until 1996, when it was replaced by the Scottish Aviation Bulldog.

Many Chipmunks that had been in military use were sold to civilians, either to private owners or to companies, where they were typically used for a variety of purposes, often involving the type&#x27;s excellent flying characteristics and its capability for aerobatic manoeuvres. More than 70 years after the type having first entered service, hundreds of Chipmunks remain airworthy and are in operation around the world. The Portuguese Air Force still operates six Chipmunks, which serve with Esquadra 802, as of 2018. The aircraft is named after the chipmunk, a small rodent.

==Development==
===Origins===

Immediately following the conclusion of the Second World War, there was a desire within Canadian aviation circles to take advantage during the peace years of the recently expanded aircraft manufacturing industry which had been rapidly built up in Canada. Out of this desire, it was decided to embark on developing aircraft which would replace designs rendered obsolete by the rapid advances made during the war in the aviation field. One such company, de Havilland Aircraft of Canada Ltd, was interested in developing its own aircraft designs, and chose to focus on producing a contemporary aircraft for pilot training, specifically intending for the envisioned type to serve as a successor to the de Havilland Tiger Moth biplane trainer, which had been produced by the thousands before and during the Second World War, and saw military service with a number of nations in that conflict.

, a Polish pre-war engineer, served as the principal designer and led the design team in the development of the new aircraft, which became known as the &quot;Chipmunk&quot;. He designed a cantilever monoplane that incorporated numerous advances over typical trainer aircraft then in widespread service. These included an enclosed cockpit complete with a rear-sliding canopy, and various aerodynamic features to manage the aircraft&#x27;s flight performance. Strakes were fitted to deter spin conditions and stall breaker strips along the inboard leading edges of the wing ensured that a stall would originate in this position as opposed to the outboard section. The Chipmunk would become the first indigenous aircraft design to be produced by de Havilland Canada.
The Chipmunk prototype, &quot;CF-DIO-X&quot;, first flew on 22 May 1946 at Downsview, Toronto, piloted by Pat Fillingham, a test pilot who had been seconded from the parent de Havilland company. The prototype was powered by a de Havilland Gipsy Major IC air-cooled inverted engine, this was replaced on the production version of the Chipmunk by a de Havilland Gipsy Major 8 engine.

===Production===
de Havilland Canada constructed the type at its factory in Downsview, Toronto, Ontario, where it produced 217 Chipmunks during the 1940s and 1950s, the final example of which having been completed during 1956. In addition, 1,000 Chipmunks were produced under licence in the United Kingdom by de Havilland; manufacturing was initially performed at the company&#x27;s facility at Hatfield Aerodrome, Hertfordshire; production was later transferred to their factory at Hawarden Aerodrome, Broughton near Chester. A further 66 Chipmunks were licence-manufactured in Portugal by OGMA (&quot;Oficinas Gerais de Material Aeronáutico&quot;), at Alverca from 1955 to 1961 for the Portuguese Air Force.

Both British-built and early Canadian-built Chipmunks are notably different from the later Canadian-built RCAF/Lebanese versions. The later Canadian-built aircraft were fitted with a bubble canopy, which replaced the multi-panelled sliding canopy that had been used upon early Canadian-produced Chipmunks, along with all of the Portuguese and British-built aircraft. On the early-built canopy, the rearmost panels intentionally bulged in order to provide the instructor&#x27;s position with superior visibility. British-built Chipmunks also differed by a number of adjustments to suit the expressed preferences of the RAF. These included the repositioning of the undercarriage legs, anti-spin strakes, landing lights, and an all-round stressed airframe.

At one point, work was being conducted on a derivative of the Chipmunk which featured an extensive cabin modification to accommodate a side-by-side seating arrangement; the aircraft, which was referred to as the &quot;DHC-2&quot;, ultimately remained unbuilt. The DHC-2 designation was subsequently reallocated to the company&#x27;s next product, the DHC-2 Beaver.

==Design==

The de Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk is a two-seat, single-engine aircraft that has been heavily used as a primary trainer aircraft. The basic configuration of the aircraft included a low-mounted wing and a two-place tandem cockpit, which was fitted with a clear perspex canopy covers the pilot/student (front) and instructor/passenger (rear) positions and provided all-round visibility. The Chipmunk uses a conventional tailwheel landing gear arrangement and is fitted with fabric-covered flight control surfaces; the wing is also fabric-covered aft of the spar. In terms of handling, the Chipmunk exhibited a gentle and responsive flight attitude. Early production aircraft were only semi-aerobatic, while later production models were almost all fully aerobatic.

The structure of the Chipmunk makes heavy use of metal, the majority of the airframe being composed of a stress-skinned alloy; this allowed the adoption of thinner wings and consequently provided for increased performance as well as a greater degree of durability. Numerous features were incorporated so that the type could better perform as a trainer, including hand-operated single-slotted wing flaps, anti-spin strakes, disc brakes on the wheeled undercarriage, a thin propeller composed of a solid lightweight alloy, the adoption of an engine-driven vacuum pump in place of external venturi tubes to power cockpit instrumentation, electric and Coffman cartridge engine starters as alternative options, cockpit lighting, onboard radio system, and an external identification light underneath the starboard wing.

In civilian service, individual aircraft would often be modified. Examples of these adaptations include extensive modifications that enabled it to perform competitive aerobatics, for which aircraft are often re-engined and fitted with constant speed propellers and inverted fuel systems; larger numbers of Chipmunks have been tasked as dedicated glider tows. It has become commonplace for Chipmunks used as such to be re-engined, often using the Lycoming O-360.

==Operational history==

===United Kingdom===
The Royal Air Force (RAF) had been one of the operators to quickly take notice of the new Canadian trainer, and encouraged its formal evaluation with an eye towards procuring it. Accordingly, a total of three Chipmunk aircraft were transported to the United Kingdom, where they underwent an evaluation by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&amp;AEE) at RAF Boscombe Down, Wiltshire. Based upon this favourable evaluation, the British Air Ministry proceeded to formulate and release Air Ministry specification T.8/48 around the type as a replacement for the de Havilland Tiger Moth biplane then in use. This specification was also contested by the rival Fairey Primer, which lost out to the Chipmunk and ultimately did not enter production.

The fully aerobatic Chipmunk was ordered to serve as an &quot;ab initio&quot; trainer for new pilots. The RAF received 735 Chipmunks, which were designated in British service as the &quot;de Havilland Chipmunk T.10&quot;; these aircraft had been manufactured in the United Kingdom by de Havilland, the parent company of de Havilland Canada.

The Chipmunk T.10 initially served with Reserve Flying Squadrons (RFS) of the RAF Volunteer Reserve (VR), as well as the University Air Squadrons. During 1958, multiple Chipmunks were pressed into service in Cyprus for conducting internal security flights during the height of civil unrest during the Cyprus dispute. Eight disassembled aircraft were flown out in the holds of Blackburn Beverley transports; following their reassembly, these Chipmunks, which were operated by No. 114 Squadron, were operated for some months into 1959.

From 1956 to 1990, the Chipmunks of the RAF Gatow Station Flight were used to conduct covert reconnaissance missions by BRIXMIS over the Berlin area. A number of Chipmunk T.10s were also used by the Army Air Corps and Fleet Air Arm to conduct primary training. Notably, Prince Philip had his first flying lesson in a Chipmunk in 1952; he declared the type to be his favourite aircraft.

Until 1996, Chipmunks remained in service with Air Training Corps (ATC) and the RAF Sections of the Combined Cadet Force (CCF) for Air Experience Flights (AEFs); the final of these AEF flights to use the Chipmunk was No. 10 Air Experience Flight, RAF Woodvale, when they were replaced by the Scottish Aviation Bulldog. The last Chipmunks in military service are still operated by the British historic flights – the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (including one of the Gatow aircraft), the Royal Navy and Army historic flights, to keep their pilots current on tailwheel aircraft. In addition, the cockpit sections of some former RAF Chipmunks have been used as ground training aids; these are colloquially known as &quot;Chippax&quot; trainers.

In 1995 and 1996, the RAF planned for a pair of Chipmunks to circumnavigate the northern hemisphere to establish a route for light aircraft from Europe to North America via Russia. The RAF chose the Chipmunk because of its reliability and ability to operate with minimal ground support. Modifications were made before the journey, including expanding fuel capacity and updating navigation equipment. The Chipmunks were accompanied on the journey by a support aircraft. In 1996, the RAF started the journey, but had to stop in Moscow due to forest fires in central Siberia. The RAF successfully completed the journey in 1997, flying over 64 days, visiting 62 airfields along the way. One of the two Chipmunks was added to the collection at the RAF Museum. The other belongs to a private owner, who has restored the Chipmunk to its condition during the round-the-world flight and flies it to aviation events.

===Canada===
In 1948, the RCAF accepted its first DHC-1 Chipmunk trainers, having received the first batch of a production run of 217 Chipmunks that would be manufactured in Canada. The Chipmunk was the first Canadian-designed aircraft to be made abroad under licence and as such, the majority of the home-grown production were destined for the RCAF. However, Canadian-built Chipmunks were also delivered to some overseas customers, including Egypt, Lebanon and Thailand.

Of the 113 Chipmunks that entered RCAF service, 79 were assigned to serve as &quot;ab initio&quot; trainers, while 34 were assigned to flying clubs for use in refresher training for RCAF Reserve pilots. The type remained in use as a trainer until the early 1970s, the last example being retired from service by the Canadian Armed Forces in 1972, three years after unification of the Canadian Armed Forces. The Chipmunk&#x27;s long service was due, in part, to its fully aerobatic capabilities and superb flying characteristics, which had contributed towards pilots frequently referring to it as being &quot;a delight to fly&quot;.

On 2 June 2015, with the landing of his Chipmunk at Pearson International Airport in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, retired de Havilland Canada test pilot George Neal established a new world record for the oldest active licensed pilot at the age of 96 years 194 days.

===Portugal===

The Portuguese Air Force (FAP) received its first DHC-1 Chipmunk Mk. 20 in 1951, being delivered to the Military Aeronautical School in Sintra. It was the first of an eventual 76 that would be delivered, replacing its almost two decade old de Havilland Tiger Moths. Its first 10 were constructed in the United Kingdom while the following 66 were licence-built by OGMA in Portugal. The Chipmunks would fly with the Elementary Flying Training Squadron (Esquadra de Instrução Elementar de Pilotagem).

By 1986, only 36 Chipmunks still remained in service, flying with Esquadra de Instrução 101. With the Chipmunks being a 40-year-old design and with the annual attrition rate of the fleet being two aircraft, in October 1987 a decision was made by the FAP to replace the Chipmunks with 18 Aérospatiale TB 30 Epsilons. Epsilon deliveries was made throughout 1989, with all remaining Chipmunks being withdrawn from service by the time the last Epsilon was delivered. Shortly afterwards, 7 Chipmunks were handed over to the Air Force Academy (AFA) to be used for glider towing.

In 1997, a major reform was made to the FAP&#x27;s training syllabus which led to the need for cost savings. This resulted in the 7 AFA Chipmunks being used by the FAP for an initial screen testing programme for potential pilots – the Estágio de Seleção de Voo (ESV). The 7 Chipmunks (serials – 1306, 1312, 1315, 1316, 1319, 1335, 1339) were first upgraded before being put into use. These upgrades consisted of replacing the Gipsy Major engines with the more powerful Lycoming O-360, adding a metal propeller, a new radio and an IFF transponder. Five of these aircraft were upgraded by OGMA at Alverca do Ribatejo, while the other two were converted by Indústrias Aeronáuticas de Coimbra (IAC). The first two upgraded Chipmunks were delivered to Esquadra 802 in July 1997 and began their screening programme the next month on 18 August. On 17 March 1998, an upgraded Chipmunk (serial – 1312) crashed on take-off at Sintra causing it to be written off, neither of the occupants – an Angolan student and Portuguese instructor – were harmed. As of 2018, Esquadra 802 still operates the remaining 6 Chipmunks.

===Civilian===
From the 1950s, the Chipmunk also became a popular civilian aircraft, used in various roles such as pilot training, aerobatics and even crop spraying. The majority of civilian aircraft are military surplus which not infrequently have been modernised. It is also a mechanically robust aircraft, so much so that numerous ex-RCAF Chipmunks have since remained operational for decades with private owners and operators around the world. By 2001, several hundred Chipmunks were reportedly operational in private service. It is familiarly known as the &quot;Chippie&quot;.

Four further Chipmunks were converted by and are operated by the Royal Air Force Gliding &amp; Soaring Association (RAFGSA); the five Supermunks are still in service (March 2020) and used for club launches, adventure training courses and major gliding competitions in the United Kingdom and Europe. A similar modification was carried out to seven Chipmunks used by the Portuguese Air Force Academy as basic training aircraft and as glider tugs.
;Scholl Super Chipmunk

:A number of Chipmunks were modified as aerobatic aircraft in the United States as the &quot;Super Chipmunk&quot;. Along with an uprated engine, the aircraft underwent an extensive makeover including clipping its wings, adding retractable landing gear, converting to a single-seat layout, adding an autopilot and being fitted with a red, white and blue wingtip and tail smoke system. The control stick was lengthened by for greater control during extreme aerobatic manoeuvres. For over 25 years, a Super Chipmunk in distinctive bright colour scheme of blue stars and sunburst effect was displayed by the aerobatic pilot Art Scholl. Four Super Chipmunk conversions were modified, Scholl&#x27;s &quot;N13A&quot; and &quot;N13Y&quot;, Harold Krier&#x27;s &quot;N6311V&quot; and Skip Volk&#x27;s &quot;N1114V&quot;. Another more recent &quot;Super Chipmunk&quot; was converted by air show performer, Jim &quot;Fang&quot; Maroney, who similarly modified an ex-RCAF example by strengthening the airframe, replacing the original engine with a version incorporating an inverted fuel and oil system, clipping off the wings and adding 30% more rudder and 10% more elevator. A spatted landing gear was retained. Another similarly modified &quot;Super Chipmunk&quot;, &quot;N1804Q&quot;, is owned and flown by air show pilot Greg Aldridge. &quot;N13Y&quot; is now on display at the National Air and Space Museum, Smithsonian Institution, Udvar-Hazy Center at Washington-Dulles International Airport., while &quot;N1114V&quot; is preserved at the EAA AirVenture Museum at Oshkosh, Wisconsin, USA.

<text>Lance corporal is a military rank, used by many English-speaking armed forces worldwide, and also by some police forces and other uniformed organisations. It is below the rank of corporal.

==Etymology==
The presumed origin of the rank of lance corporal derives from an amalgamation of &quot;corporal&quot; from the Italian phrase &quot;capo corporale&quot; (&quot;head of the body&quot;) with the now-archaic &quot;&quot;, which in turn derives from the Italian &quot;lancia spezzata&quot;, which literally means &quot;broken lance&quot; or &quot;broken spear&quot;, formerly a non-commissioned officer of the lowest rank. It can be translated as &quot;one who has broken a lance in combat&quot;, and is therefore a leader. Other sources claim that it referred to a knight who had broken his lance and lost his horse, and thus had to join a foot company temporarily; or to gendarmerie who could no longer afford to fight on horseback and formed a foot unit.

&quot;Lance&quot; or &quot;lances fournies&quot; was also a term used in medieval Europe to denote a unit of soldiers (usually three or six men).

==Brazil==
After the independence of Brazil in 1822, the new Brazilian Army followed the Portuguese system of ranks, having also the rank of &quot;anspeçada&quot;. The rank existed also in the Brazilian States&#x27; Military Police Forces and in the Military Firefighters Corps. The rank of &quot;anspeçada&quot; was discontinued in Brazil in the first half of the 20th century.

==Commonwealth of Nations==
In Commonwealth forces, a lance corporal is usually the second-in-command of a section. Lance corporals are commonly addressed as &quot;corporal&quot;, with &quot;lance jack&quot; or &quot;half-screw&quot; (with corporals being &quot;full screws&quot;) being common colloquialisms for the rank. Much like the use of bombardier instead of corporal in artillery units, lance corporals are known as lance bombardiers in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. The badge of rank is a single chevron worn on both sleeves or on an epaulette.

===Australia and New Zealand===
Lance corporal is the lowest of the non-commissioned officer ranks in the Australian Army and New Zealand Army, falling between private and corporal. It is the only appointed rank, and thus demotion is easier than with other ranks. A commanding officer can demote a lance corporal, whereas other ranks require a court martial for demotion. A lance corporal is usually the second in command of a section, and is in control of the gun group in an infantry section. There is no equivalent rank within the Royal Australian or New Zealand Air Force or Navy.

Second corporal was also formerly used in Australia in the same way that it was used in the British Army.

===Bangladesh===
In the Bangladesh Army, the rank of lance corporal is above the rank of &quot;sainik&quot; (সৈনিক) and below the rank of corporal.

===Canada===
The Canadian Armed Forces abolished the Canadian Army rank of lance corporal on their creation as a unified force in 1968.

===United Kingdom===
====British Army and Royal Marines====
Lance corporal (LCpl or formerly L/Cpl) is the lowest ranking non-commissioned officer in the British Army and Royal Marines, between private and corporal. Although officially they have a NATO grade of OR3, they are often treated as OR5s when working with U.S. forces as they have the same battlefield role of fire team commander as a sergeant in the U.S. Army. The badge of rank is a single point-down chevron worn on both sleeves, or on an epaulette on the front of the Combat Soldier 95 dress standard. However, lance corporals in the Foot Guards, Honourable Artillery Company, 1st The Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards and The Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars wear two chevrons and lance corporals in the Household Cavalry wear two chevrons surmounted by a gilt crown. The Royal Artillery uses the rank of lance bombardier instead.

The date of introduction of lance corporals to the British Army is unclear, but the rank is mentioned in late-18th century military essays such as Major William Young&#x27;s &quot;An essay on the Command of Small Detachments&quot; (1766) and John Williamson&#x27;s &quot;The Elements of Military Arrangement&quot; (1781):

&quot;When from sickness or other causes there are not in a company a sufficient number of non-commission officers to do the duty, the captain can appoint corporals to do the duty of serjeants, who are called lance serjeants, and private men to do the duty of corporals, who are called lance corporals.&quot;

The designation &quot;chosen man&quot;, used during the Napoleonic Wars, was possibly a precursor to the rank. The first mention of a lance corporal in &quot;The Times&quot; is in 1819, although the first mention in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; is not until 1831. The first mention in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of a lance corporal in the Royal Marines is in 1838.

Until 1 September 1961, lance corporal and lance bombardier were only appointments rather than substantive ranks, given to privates (or equivalent) who were acting NCOs, and could be taken away by the soldier&#x27;s commanding officer (whereas a full corporal or bombardier could only be demoted by court martial). Until 1920, the Royal Engineers and Army Ordnance Corps also used the similar rank of second corporal, which was a substantive rank (also wearing one chevron). Until 1920, bombardiers in the Royal Artillery were equivalent to second corporals and until 1918 (when the rank of lance bombardier replaced it), acting bombardiers were equivalent to lance corporals (both wearing one chevron).

In the infantry, a lance corporal usually serves as second-in-command of a section and commander of its delta fire team. It is also a rank commonly held by specialists such as clerks, drivers, signallers, machine-gunners, and mortarmen. In the Intelligence Corps and Royal Military Police, all other ranks are promoted to lance corporal on completion of their training.

====Royal Air Force====
On 1 April 2010, the rank of lance corporal was introduced into the RAF Regiment, although it is not used by other branches of the Royal Air Force. RAF Regiment lance corporals have powers of charge over aircraftmen, leading aircraftmen and senior aircraftmen, but not junior technicians or senior aircraftmen technicians, who, despite being OR2s, require a corporal or above to charge if required.

====Cadet forces====

The British cadet forces reflect the ranks of their parent services, so the Army Cadet Force, the Army section of the Combined Cadet Force (CCF), and the various marine cadet organisations use cadet lance corporal as their lowest NCO rank. In the CCF (RAF), this rank is also used as the lowest NCO rank (it was formerly known as junior corporal before its introduction into the RAF Regiment). The Air Training Corps and the naval cadet forces do not use the rank.

==Portugal==
In the Portuguese Army, the equivalent of a lance corporal rank used to be that of &quot;anspeçada&quot;. This rank was replaced at the end of the 19th century by the present rank of &quot;segundo-cabo&quot; (second corporal), the former rank of &quot;cabo&quot; (corporal) being renamed &quot;primeiro-cabo&quot; (first corporal).

==Singapore==
=== Singapore Armed Forces ===
The Lance Corporal (LCP) rank in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) is between the rank of Private (PTE) and Corporal (CPL).

Lance-corporals who are appointed second-in-command/third-in-command of a section can give commands to the rest of the section. National servicemen are usually promoted to this rank after completing their respective vocational courses and within the first year of service. Servicemen who fail to pass their Individual physical proficiency test (IPPT) during their active service will have their rank capped at LCP regardless of vocation.

A lance-corporal wears rank insignia of a single point-down chevron with an arc above it (similar to an inverted US Army PFC rank insignia).

=== Uniformed youth organisations ===
In the National Cadet Corps (NCC), the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) and the National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC), the rank of lance corporal is below the rank of corporal. Generally, the rank is awarded to cadets in secondary two. NCC, NPCC and NCDCC lance corporals rarely, if not never, have the chance to command a squad.

NCC lance corporals wear the same rank insignia as that of the SAF, except that the letters &#x27;NCC&#x27; are below the insignia so as to differentiate NCC cadets from SAF personnel. NPCC and NCDCC lance corporals wear the same rank insignia as that of an SCDF lance corporal, except that the letters &#x27;NPCC&#x27; and &#x27;NCDCC&#x27; are below the insignia so as to differentiate NPCC and NCDCC cadets from Singapore Police Force and Singapore Civil Defence Force personnel respectively.

==United States==


===Army===

Lance corporal was a title used in the United States Army to denote privates serving as temporary non-commissioned officers. The title of lance corporal existed in the U.S. Army from at least 1802, as the U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry documents its first occurrence in an &quot;unofficial journal&quot; dated that year. The first official use of the title of lance corporal is documented in the &quot;General Regulations for the Army, or, Military Institutes&quot; (Articles 18 and 20), authorised by an Act of Congress on 2 March 1821 and published by the War Department in July 1821 and again on 1 March 1825.

In the &quot;General Regulations for the Army of the United States&quot; (Article XVI, Paragraph 64), published on 25 January 1841, and again in the 1847 edition (Article XIII, Paragraph 121; Article XIV, Paragraph 134; and Article XLIX Paragraph 818), the title of lance corporal is authorised. Again, in the &quot;Revised Army Regulations of 1861&quot; published on 10 August 1861 and in the 1863 edition &quot;With An Appendix Containing the Changes and Laws Affecting Army Regulations And Articles Of War To June 25, 1863&quot; (Article 40, Paragraph 971), lance corporal is authorised. Lance corporal is again authorised in &quot;Regulations of the Army of the United States and General Orders In Force on the 17th of February 1881&quot; (Article LV, Paragraph 812) and in &quot;Regulations of the Army of the United States 1895&quot; (Article XXXII, Paragraph 257).

In the edition of 1901 &quot;With Appendix Separately Indexed And Showing Changes to January 1, 1901&quot;, in the Appendix, page 331, in &quot;Headquarters of the Army, General Orders, No. 42, June 30, 1897, Part II&quot;, the lance corporal is authorised to wear &quot;...a chevron having one bar...&quot; In &quot;Regulations for the Army of the United States 1904&quot; (Article XXX, Paragraph 263), &quot;...no company shall have more than one lance corporal at a time, unless there are noncommissioned officers absent by authority, during which absences there may be one for each absentee.&quot; This proscription appears again in Article XXX, Paragraph 272 of &quot;Regulations for the Army of the United States 1910&quot;, and the editions of 1913, and 1917 &quot;Corrected to April 15, 1917 (Changes, Nos. 1 to 55)&quot;.

In 1920, the former lance corporal insignia of rank was assigned to the rank of private first class in &quot;War Department Circular No. 303&quot;, dated 3 August 1920. However, the Institute of Heraldry states that some older U.S. Army Tables of Organization and Equipment still in use in 1940 continued to authorise lance corporals.

In February 1965, the US Army announced that, effective from 1 September 1965, pay grade E-3 would be redesignated as lance corporal. The rank insignia was to be the pre-World War II specialist grade 6 insignia of one chevron above one arc, or &quot;rocker&quot;. However, by September 1965 the plan was cancelled. The insignia was, however, adopted for pay grade E-3, which continued to be named private first class.

===Marine Corps===
Lance corporal (LCpl) is the third enlisted rank in order of seniority in the United States Marine Corps, just above private first class and below corporal. It is the most commonly held rank in the USMC, and the highest one that a marine can hold without being a non-commissioned officer.

The USMC is the only component of the U.S. Armed Forces to currently use the rank. Promotion to lance corporal is based on time in grade, time in service, and the conduct of the marine. Further promotion to the NCO ranks (corporal and above) is competitive and takes into account the individual service record of the marine. There can only be a certain number of corporals and sergeants in each MOS, so even with a qualifying score, promotions may be delayed due to an excessive number of corporals occupying billets in a certain MOS.

From the earliest years of the Corps, the ranks of lance corporal and lance sergeant were in common usage. The rank of lance corporal has been used in the Marine Corps since the 1830s in the Indian Wars. Marines were appointed temporarily from the next lower rank to the higher grade but were still paid at the lower rank. By 1887, this practice was widespread in the Corps. The Commandant had later ordered that such appointments should only last one month, and that if the marine holding the appointment had failed to pass the relevant examination for the rank he was temporarily serving by the end of this one month period, his appointment was to be given to someone else. As the rank structure became more firmly defined, the rank of lance sergeant fell out of use, but the rank of lance corporal remained in unofficial use in the Corps into the 1930s, although it had officially become redundant when the rank of private first class was established in 1917. The rank of lance corporal fell out of usage prior to World War II, but was permanently re-established in the sweeping rank restructuring of 1958.

=== Other agencies ===
Some law enforcement agencies, most notably the South Carolina Highway Patrol, use the rank for non-supervisory officers.

===Sweden===
Sweden uses the rank of &quot;vicekorpral&quot; (previously &quot;vicekonstapel&quot;, or &quot;vice constable&quot;, in the artillery and anti-aircraft artillery) between private and &quot;korpral&quot;. It was primarily a training grade discontinued in 1972 but reinstated in 2009.

<doc id="362631" wikidata="Q103510" url="?curid=362631" title="Bar (unit)">
<text>The bar is a metric unit of pressure defined as 100,000 Pa (100 kPa), though not part of the International System of Units (SI). A pressure of 1 bar is slightly less than the current average atmospheric pressure on Earth at sea level (approximately 1.013 bar). By the barometric formula, 1 bar is roughly the atmospheric pressure on Earth at an altitude of 111 metres at 15 °C.

The bar and the millibar were introduced by the Norwegian meteorologist Vilhelm Bjerknes, who was a founder of the modern practice of weather forecasting, with the bar defined as one megadyne per square centimeter.

The SI brochure, despite previously mentioning the bar, now omits any mention of it. The bar has been legally recognised in countries of the European Union since 2004. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) deprecates its use except for &quot;limited use in meteorology&quot; and lists it as one of several units that &quot;must not be introduced in fields where they are not presently used&quot;. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) also lists it under &quot;Non-SI units and symbols whose continued use is deprecated&quot;.

Units derived from the bar include the megabar (symbol: Mbar), kilobar (symbol: kbar), decibar (symbol: dbar), centibar (symbol: cbar), and millibar (symbol: mbar). 

== Definition and conversion ==
The bar is defined using the SI derived unit, pascal: ≡ 100,000 Pa ≡ 100,000 N/m2.

Thus, is equal to:

* 1,000,000 Ba (barye) (in cgs units);
and 1 bar is approximately equal to:
* 
* 
* 1019.716 centimetres of water (cmH2O) (1 bar approximately corresponds to the gauge pressure of water at a depth of 10 meters).

1 millibar (mbar) is equal to:
* (0.001 bar)

== Origin ==
The word &quot;bar&quot; has its origin in the Ancient Greek word (), meaning weight. The unit&#x27;s official symbol is bar; the earlier symbol b is now deprecated and conflicts with the uses of b denoting the unit barn or bit, but it is still encountered, especially as mb (rather than the proper mbar) to denote the millibar. Between 1793 and 1795, the word &quot;bar&quot; was used for a unit of mass (equal to the modern tonne) in an early version of the metric system.

== Usage ==

Atmospheric air pressure where standard atmospheric pressure is defined as 1013.25 mbar, 101.325 kPa, 1.01325 bar, which is about . Despite the millibar not being an SI unit, meteorologists and weather reporters worldwide have long measured air pressure in millibar as the values are convenient. After the advent of SI units, some meteorologists began using hectopascals (symbol hPa) which are numerically equivalent to millibar; for the same reason, the hectopascal is now the standard unit used to express barometric pressures in aviation in most countries. For example, the weather office of Environment Canada uses kilopascals and hectopascals on their weather maps. In contrast, Americans are familiar with the use of the millibar in US reports of hurricanes and other cyclonic storms.

In fresh water, there is an approximate numerical equivalence between the change in pressure in decibar and the change in depth from the water surface in metres. Specifically, an increase of 1 decibar occurs for every 1.019716 m increase in depth. In sea water with respect to the gravity variation, the latitude and the geopotential anomaly the pressure can be converted into metres&#x27; depth according to an empirical formula (UNESCO Tech. Paper 44, p. 25). As a result, decibar is commonly used in oceanography.

In scuba diving, bar is also the most widely used unit to express pressure, e.g. 200 bar being a full standard scuba tank, and depth increments of 10 metre of seawater being equivalent to 1 bar of pressure. 

Many engineers worldwide use the bar as a unit of pressure because, in much of their work, using pascals would involve using very large numbers. In measurement of vacuum and in vacuum engineering, residual pressures are typically given in millibar, although torr or millimeter of mercury (mmHg) were historically common.

Pressures resulting from deflagrations are often expressed in units of bar. 

In the automotive field, turbocharger boost is often described in bar outside the United States. Tire pressure is often specified in bar. In hydraulic machinery components are rated to the maximum system oil pressure, which is typically in hundreds of bar. For example, 300 bar is common for industrial fixed machinery. 

In the maritime ship industries, pressures in piping systems, such as cooling water systems, is often measured in bar.

Unicode has characters for &quot;mb&quot; (), &quot;bar&quot; () and (; &quot;millibar&quot; spelt in katakana), but they exist only for compatibility with legacy Asian encodings and are not intended to be used in new documents.

The kilobar, equivalent to 100 MPa, is commonly used in geological systems, particularly in experimental petrology.

The abbreviations &quot;bar(a)&quot; and &quot;bara&quot; are sometimes used to indicate absolute pressures, and &quot;bar(g)&quot; and &quot;barg&quot; for gauge pressures. The usage is deprecated but still prevails in the oil industry (often by capitalized &quot;BarG&quot; and &quot;BarA&quot;). As gauge pressure is relative to the current ambient pressure, which may vary in absolute terms by about 50 mbar, &quot;BarG&quot; and &quot;BarA&quot; are not interconvertible. Fuller descriptions such as &quot;gauge pressure of 2 bars&quot; or &quot;2-bar gauge&quot; are recommended.

<text>Ursinae is a subfamily of Ursidae (bears) named by Swainson (1835). It was assigned to Ursidae by Bjork (1970), Hunt (1998), and Jin et al. (2007).

==Classification==

The genera &quot;Melursus&quot; and &quot;Helarctos&quot; are sometimes also included in &quot;Ursus&quot;. The Asiatic black bear and the polar bear used to be placed in their own genera, &quot;Selenarctos&quot; and &quot;Thalarctos&quot;; these are now placed at subgenus rank.

<text>Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (2 May 1902 – 5 September 1959) was a Polish mathematician and Professor at the Warsaw University of Technology who was interested primarily in topology and graph theory.

==Biography==

Zarankiewicz was born in Częstochowa, to father Stanisław and mother Józefa (&quot;née&quot; Borowska). He studied at the University of Warsaw, together with Zygmunt Janiszewski, Stefan Mazurkiewicz, Wacław Sierpiński, Kazimierz Kuratowski, and Stanisław Saks.

During World War II, Zarankiewicz took part in illegal teaching, forbidden by the German authorities, and was eventually sent to a concentration camp. He survived and became a teacher at Warsaw University of Technology (Polish: &quot;Politechnika Warszawska&quot;).

He visited universities in Tomsk, Harvard, London, and Vienna. He served as president of the Warsaw section of the Polish Mathematical Society and the International Astronautical Federation.

He died in London, England.

==Research contributions==
Zarankiewicz wrote works on cut-points in connected spaces, on conformal mappings, on complex functions and number theory, and triangular numbers.

The Zarankiewicz problem is named after Zarankiewicz. This problem asks, for a given size of (0,1)-matrix, how many matrix entries must be set equal to 1 in order to guarantee that the matrix contains at least one &quot;a&quot; × &quot;b&quot; submatrix is made up only of 1&#x27;s. An equivalent formulation in extremal graph theory asks for the maximum number of edges in a bipartite graph with no complete bipartite subgraph &quot;K&quot;&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;.

The Zarankiewicz crossing number conjecture in the mathematical field of graph theory is also named after Zarankiewicz. The conjecture states that the crossing number of a complete bipartite graph formula_1 equals
:formula_2
Zarankiewicz proved that this formula is an upper bound for the actual crossing number. The problem of determining the number formula_3 was suggested by Paul Turán and became known as Turán&#x27;s brick factory problem.

<text>Grand Theft Auto III is a 2001 action-adventure game developed by DMA Design and published by Rockstar Games. It was the first 3D game in the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series. Set within the fictional Liberty City (loosely based on New York City), the story follows Claude, a silent protagonist who, after being left for dead by his girlfriend during a robbery, embarks on a quest for revenge leading him to become entangled in a world of crime, drugs, gang warfare, and corruption. The game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. Its open world design lets players freely roam Liberty City.

Development was shared between DMA Design, based in Edinburgh, and Rockstar, based in New York City. Development involved transforming popular &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; elements into a fully 3D world for the first time. The game was delayed following the September 11 attacks to allow the team to change references and gameplay deemed inappropriate. &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; was released in October 2001 for the PlayStation 2, in May 2002 for Windows, and in November 2003 for the Xbox. Mobile ports were released for the tenth anniversary in 2011, followed by a remastered version for the twentieth in 2021.

&quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; received critical acclaim for its concept, gameplay, sound design, and visual fidelity, but generated controversies for its violence and sex. It received year-end accolades from several gaming publications, and it is considered a landmark game in the open world concept, one of the most significant games of the sixth generation of consoles, and among the best video games. It was the best-selling video game of 2001 and among the best-selling PlayStation 2 games with over 11.6 million copies sold; it has sold over 14.5 million copies overall. The game was followed by &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot; (2002) and two prequels, &quot;Advance&quot; (2004) and &quot;Liberty City Stories&quot; (2005).

== Gameplay ==
&quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective. Players complete missions—linear scenarios with set objectives—to progress through the story. It is possible to have several missions available at a time, as some missions require players to wait for further instructions or events. Outside of missions, players can freely roam the game&#x27;s open world, and have the ability to complete optional side missions. Liberty City is composed of three boroughs: Portland, Staunton Island, and Shoreside Vale; the latter two areas become unlocked as the player progresses through the storyline.

Players may run, jump or use vehicles to navigate the game&#x27;s world. In combat, auto-aim can be used as assistance against enemies. Should players take damage, their health meter can be fully regenerated through the use of health pick-ups. Body armour can be used to absorb gunshots and explosive damage, but is used up in the process. When health is entirely depleted, gameplay stops and players respawn at the nearest hospital, at the expense of losing armour, weapons, and an amount of money.

If players commit crimes while playing, the game&#x27;s law enforcement agencies may respond as indicated by a &quot;wanted&quot; meter in the head-up display (HUD). On the meter, the displayed stars indicate the current wanted level (for example, at the maximum six-star level, efforts by law enforcement to incapacitate players become very aggressive). Law enforcement officers will search for players who leave the wanted vicinity. The wanted meter enters a cooldown mode and eventually recedes when players are hidden from the officers&#x27; line of sight.

The game lets players control the mute criminal Claude. Throughout the story, Claude meets various players from the criminal underworld. As players complete missions for different gangs and criminal organisations, fellow gang members will often defend players, while rival gang members will recognise players and subsequently shoot on sight. While free roaming the game world, players may engage in activities such as a vigilante minigame, a firefighting activity, a paramedic service and a taxi cab service. Completion of these activities grants players with context-specific rewards; for example, completing the vigilante mission allows players to bribe police after committing a crime.

Players use melee attacks, firearms and explosives to fight enemies. The firearms include weapons such as the Micro Uzi, an M16 rifle and a flamethrower. The game&#x27;s three-dimensional environment allows a first-person view while aiming with the sniper rifle, rocket launcher and the M16 rifle. In addition, the game&#x27;s combat was reworked to allow players to commit drive-by shootings by facing sideways in a vehicle. The game gives players a wide variety of weapon options—they can be purchased from local firearms dealers, found on the ground, retrieved from dead enemies, or found around the city.

== Plot ==
Small-time criminal Claude is betrayed and shot by his girlfriend Catalina (voiced by Cynthia Farrell) during a bank heist outside Liberty City. Claude is arrested but escapes during his transfer to prison when members of the Colombian Cartel ambush his transport to abduct another prisoner. During his escape, Claude befriends explosives expert and fellow convict 8-Ball (Guru), who shelters Claude and introduces him to the Leone Mafia family for work. Claude assists the Mafia with various operations, including winning a gang war against a local group of Triads, earning him the respect of Don Salvatore Leone (Frank Vincent). After learning the Cartel are creating and selling a new street drug called SPANK to fund their expansion into Liberty City, Salvatore orders Claude to destroy their floating drug lab. Claude accomplishes this with 8-Ball&#x27;s help.

Salvatore later instructs Claude to deal with a minor problem, but his trophy wife Maria (Debi Mazar), who took a liking to Claude, reveals it to be a set-up. Maria claims she lied to Salvatore about having an affair with Claude to make him jealous, and now Salvatore wants to kill him. Claude escapes to Staunton Island with Maria and her friend Asuka Kasen (Lianna Pai). After killing Salvatore to cut ties with the Mafia, Claude begins working for the yakuza, led by Asuka and her brother Kenji (Les J.N. Mau). During this time, he also provides assistance to corrupt police inspector Ray Machowski (Robert Loggia), whom he eventually helps flee the city, and influential businessman Donald Love (Kyle MacLachlan). Donald hires Claude to kill Kenji under the guise of a Cartel attack to start a gang war to allow Donald to obtain construction sites for his businesses. After the job&#x27;s success, Claude carries out another task for Donald that leads him to encounter Catalina, now the leader of the Cartel, at a construction site. However, Catalina escapes after betraying and shooting her partner, Miguel (Al Espinosa).

Asuka blames the Cartel for Kenji&#x27;s death and seizes the construction site. The yakuza capture the wounded Miguel and torture him for information on Cartel operations in the city, allowing Claude to strike against them and hinder the Cartel. Enraged, Catalina murders both Asuka and Miguel and kidnaps Maria, demanding $500,000 for her release. Claude meets with her to pay the ransom, but Catalina deceives him again and traps him. Claude escapes, rescues Maria, and destroys the helicopter Catalina attempts to flee in, killing her. As Claude and Maria leave the scene, the latter begins to complain about the kidnapping, but is silenced by a gunshot.

== Development ==
The core development team of &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; consisted of about 23 people at DMA Design in Edinburgh, who worked closely with publisher Rockstar Games in New York City. The original tech demo was created on Sega&#x27;s Dreamcast around the end of development on &quot;Grand Theft Auto 2&quot; (1999). Rockstar had been pressuring its teams to create a 3D open world, and the DMA group who developed &quot;Space Station Silicon Valley&quot; (1998) began working on a project separate from the &quot;Grand Theft Auto 2&quot; team. Alan Jack, a DMA support engineer, described it as combining &quot;Body Harvest&quot; (1998) exploration with &quot;Space Station Silicon Valley&quot; city level.

The team chose against using the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; branding to avoid conflict with the &quot;Grand Theft Auto 2&quot; team and began developing their game as a &quot;Godzilla&quot; project. After Take-Two Interactive acquired DMA from Infogrames in September 1999, the &quot;Space Station Silicon Valley&quot; and &quot;Grand Theft Auto 2&quot; teams were combined. The combined team began developing &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; for the Dreamcast, but shifted to the PlayStation 2 after four months. Technical director Obbe Vermeij said the shift was not due to hardware constraints, but because it became clear the Dreamcast was not commercially viable. He described the decision as disappointing, noting the DMA Design staff were big fans of &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot; (2000).

During the Dreamcast phase, DMA Design developed city blocks with brownstones, docks, and retail areas, alongside vehicles and pedestrians. By early 2001, the team had designed the city, cars and some weapons. Producer Leslie Benzies described &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; as a &quot;crime simulation game&quot;. Rockstar offered &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; to Microsoft Game Studios as an Xbox exclusive, but Microsoft declined due to its adult nature and poorly-performing predecessors. The game was released for the PlayStation 2 on 23 October 2001 in North America. When porting the game to Windows, the team delayed it from the PlayStation 2 release in order to ensure quality, citing issues with the simultaneous platform release of previous &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; games. Capcom published the game in Japan on 25 September 2003.

=== Design ===
&quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; is the first 3D game in the series, using Criterion Games&#x27;s RenderWare game engine. Executive producer Sam Houser had always wanted the series to move to 3D, and DMA Design had experimented with 3D worlds in games like &quot;Body Harvest&quot; and &quot;Space Station Silicon Valley&quot;. With the release of the PlayStation 2, the team felt a large 3D world was possible. Art director Aaron Garbut felt other video games at the time &quot;were a thing you played&quot;, wanting &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; to be &quot;a place you lived in&quot;. An online multiplayer mode was planned, but dropped due to time and resource limitations.

When designing the game, the development team expanded upon concepts introduced in the previous &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; games. Benzies said the intention was to recreate the &quot;freedom and diversity&quot; of the previous games in a &quot;living, breathing 3D world&quot;, using the power of the PlayStation 2 to do so. The console&#x27;s ability to use DVDs, an improvement over the PlayStation&#x27;s limit to CDs, allowed the team to store more data, such as animations, music and environments. Despite this, the team found it difficult to fit the game into the PlayStation 2&#x27;s 32 megabytes of RAM, due to the scale. The game&#x27;s size also created difficulties for the testers, due to the variety of options. Benzies felt creating a living city was the &quot;underlying principle&quot; of the game&#x27;s concept during development. Sam Houser felt the game&#x27;s 3D element allowed the &quot;chemistry of the team [to come] together perfectly for the first time&quot;.

A major difficulty the team encountered was converting all game elements into a fully 3D world, including the sound and radio stations, as well as designing and voicing the non-player characters, due to the amount that existed within the open world. Producer Dan Houser said there were about 8,000 lines of recorded dialogue in the game, while audio programmer Raymond Usher estimated about 18,000. The basic technical elements of the game began to work together in mid-2000, with a carjacking mechanic prototype and stable streaming model. Streaming was initially intended to be reserved for music and map geometry, but other elements were eventually included when it became apparent to the team as more data was entered.

When designing the game world, the team initially created a &quot;hybrid city&quot;, which Dan Houser described as &quot;a post industrial Midwest slash east coast generic&quot; city. Upon developing within this game world, the team realised basing the design on a real location meant &quot;you have a lot of things you can say about it&quot;. As a result, they redesigned Liberty City, which had been previously featured in the first &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; (1997), basing it loosely on New York City. DMA Design worked with a team at Rockstar in New York for cultural references; the Rockstar team would regularly work long hours for full weeks, ensuring the references, such as in-game car manufacturers, were appropriate to the city.

The city is broken into three islands: an industrial section representing Brooklyn and Queens, a commercial centre resembling Manhattan, and suburbs similar to New Jersey. The islands unlock as the story progresses; the team wanted players to &quot;start out feeling poor and work to being richer&quot;. Dan Houser described Liberty City as a &quot;hybrid of a generic American city&quot;, including Chicago, Pittsburgh, Detroit, New York, and Philadelphia; he felt the parallel realism of the world allowed the team to make more social commentary than previously. Sam Houser cited films and shows like &quot;Heat&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Sopranos&quot; (1999–2007) as inspiration for the setting and wanted to emulate them in the game. He also cited the influence of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; and the 1990 film &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, describing &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; as &quot;a cross between a gangster movie and an RPG&quot;.

=== Story and characters ===
The team developed the story and design simultaneously. Dan Houser said, &quot;we use the story to expose the mechanics, and we use the mechanics to tell the story&quot;; however, he found it difficult to create the narrative, as the game is so strongly focused on player freedom. He wanted the story to be more nuanced and interesting than the generic &quot;rise and fall and rise again of a superhero bad guy&quot;. The game&#x27;s script was also focused on mission objectives, attempting to implement high amounts of interactivity. Dan Houser felt each mission is &quot;its own short story&quot;, and part of an &quot;overarching story&quot;. He and co-writer James Worrall drew influence from films like &quot;The Warriors&quot;, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, &quot;Scarface&quot;, and &quot;Payback&quot;, and the depiction of mafiosi featured in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s films; When writing the story, Dan Houser and Worrall regularly met with the designers, and filled a room with post-it notes to reconstruct the story components to shape the game. 

Many of the game characters were animated using motion capture, filmed at a rented studio at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, though this was limited by technical constraints. The character movement was also treated as being cinematic, though limited polygons heavily inhibited this. Animating non-player characters entering and driving cars proved to be difficult for the team, due to the variety of vehicle designs. &quot;It involved chaining together dozens of different animations and altering key frames in code&quot;, recalled software engineer Alan Campbell. The team used varying camera angles when animating the game&#x27;s cutscenes to evoke different emotions. For the voice acting, the team wanted &quot;natural, subtle performances&quot;, which proved difficult as many of the actors &quot;had in their head the idea that because video games are animated, their performances needed to be animated&quot;, explained motion capture director Navid Khonsari.

Claude is unnamed in the game, and his name is not officially revealed until his appearance in &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; (2004). He is a silent protagonist, never speaking throughout his appearances; the team decided upon this primarily because it &quot;did not seem like a major issue&quot;, due to the other challenges faced during development, and also partly to allow players to identify with the character, as he would be who the players want him to be. The developers did not have &quot;any one single inspiration&quot; for Claude; they liked the idea of a &quot;strong, silent killer, who would be juxtaposed with all of these neurotic and verbose mobsters&quot;.

=== Sound and radio design ===
&quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; features about three and a half hours of in-game radio material. For the music, the team sought a broad diversity to recreate the real sensation of skipping through radio stations, reflecting the gangster movie culture invoked by the game. The team used the talk radio stations to add character to the city and provide a &quot;unique take on American life&quot;; Sam Houser described it as &quot;a very iconoclastic look at America&quot;. The team used real DJs to portray those on the radio. In doing so, they wrote unusual dialogue for the DJs, seeking the effect of &quot;high production values and absurd content&quot;. Music director Craig Conner assembled the assets of the radio station—music, advertisements, DJ dialogue, and station imaging.

Chatterbox FM, one of the game&#x27;s radio stations, is entirely talk radio hosted by Lazlow Jones, who met Rockstar&#x27;s managing director Terry Donovan in 2001 as they were both preparing to travel to Los Angeles for E3. Donovan invited Jones to Rockstar&#x27;s offices in Manhattan, where he met the development team, including Dan and Sam Houser and producer Jamie King, and they invited him to work on the game. The writing sessions took place at Dan Houser&#x27;s apartment, and the entire process, including editing and recording, took around four to five months. With the station&#x27;s guests and callers, the writers wanted to satirise American lifestyles, focusing on fictional stories as opposed to quickly outdated stories based on recent news. Jones found the conversations to be natural, having worked in radio for several years. The roles of the guests and callers were performed by Jones&#x27;s friends and neighbours, including his father, and were recorded in New York.

=== Cuts and changes ===


Prior to &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;″s initial release, several modifications were made to the game. While changes are frequent during game development, these changes were noted to be around the time of the 11 September attacks, which led to speculation that the changes were motivated by the attacks. On 19 September 2001, Rockstar delayed the game&#x27;s release by three weeks, citing the attacks as an influencing factor in the delay. &quot;Everyone had someone who had an uncle or brother [who was impacted by the attack]&quot;, said Paul Eibeler, then president of Take-Two Interactive.

One of the changes made shortly after the 9/11 attacks was the colour scheme of the police cars. Originally blue with white stripes, resembling the New York City Police Department, it was changed to a black-and-white design common among several police departments in the United States, such as Los Angeles and San Francisco. Other changes included altering the flight path of a plane to avoid appearing to fly into or behind a skyscraper and removing a mission referencing terrorists, as well as some changes to pedestrian dialogue and talk radio. Another cut to the game was the character of Darkel, a revolutionary urchin who vowed to bring down the city&#x27;s economy. When references to Darkel were found in the game&#x27;s code, speculation arose that he was related to 9/11, but Dan Houser explained the character had been cut &quot;months before [release]&quot;. There were reports and previews stating the game featured schoolchildren as pedestrians prior to release, although Rockstar dismissed such rumours as &quot;nonsense&quot;.

Rockstar stated the game was &quot;about 1% different&quot; after 9/11, and the biggest change was the cover art. They felt the game&#x27;s original cover, which was still used for its release in Europe, was &quot;too raw&quot; after 9/11, and it was changed to what became the &quot;signature style&quot; of the series. Sam Houser said the cover was designed in an evening and was instantly preferred over the original cover. The cover was inspired by the movie posters for 1960s films, such as &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; (1968).

== Reception ==
=== Critical response ===

&quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; was released to critical acclaim. Metacritic calculated an average score of 97 out of 100, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;, based on 56 reviews. It is tied with &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 3&quot; as the highest-rated PlayStation 2 game on the site and tied with a number of others as the sixth-highest-rated game overall. Reviewers liked the game&#x27;s sound, gameplay, and open world design, though some criticism was directed at the controls. Tom Bramwell of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; called &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; &quot;a luscious, sprawling epic&quot;, and &quot;Official PlayStation Magazine&quot; named it &quot;the most innovative, outlandish, brilliant video game&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Jeff Gerstmann described the game as &quot;an incredible experience that shouldn&#x27;t be missed by anyone&quot;; &quot;IGN&quot;″s Doug Perry named it &quot;one of the best titles of the year, on PlayStation 2, or on any system&quot;.

Many reviewers found the 3D graphics a welcome change from the 2D of the previous games. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Gerstmann particularly praised the character and vehicle models, and the overall texture quality of the city. &quot;GameSpy&quot;″s Andrei Alupului found the graphics &quot;really rather impressive&quot;, describing the car models as &quot;greatly improved&quot; over those in &quot;Midnight Club&quot;. &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Bramwell considered the graphics &quot;generally pleasant to look at&quot;, but considered it inferior to games like &quot;Gran Turismo 3&quot; and &quot;Ico&quot;. Justin Leeper of &quot;Game Informer&quot; described game world as &quot;stunning in scope and detail&quot;, and Perry of &quot;IGN&quot; found it to be &quot;on a scale that&#x27;s truly epic&quot;. &quot;Game Revolution&quot;″s Ben Silverman called the city a &quot;technological marvel ... that captures the essence of gritty city life in amazing detail&quot;.

&quot;IGN&quot;″s Perry considered the game&#x27;s sound &quot;unbelievably and meticulously delivered&quot;, particularly praising the soundtrack, voice acting and sound design, stating it was &quot;really approached as if it were done for a movie&quot;. &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Bramwell echoed similar remarks, describing the city sounds as &quot;perfect&quot; and the soundtrack as &quot;monstrous&quot;. The sound was described as &quot;terrific&quot; by &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Gerstmann and &quot;Game Revolution&quot;″s Silverman, and &quot;1UP.com&quot; appreciated the subtlety of the in-game radio stations. &quot;AllGame&quot;″s Scott Alan Marriott named the music &quot;the true star&quot; of the game.

Reviewers considered the style of the game&#x27;s missions to be a welcoming departure from those in previous games. &quot;1UP.com&quot; described the missions as &quot;wonderfully creative&quot;, while &quot;GamesMaster&quot; appreciated the diversity. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Perry similarly appreciated the variety and scale of the missions, and praised the amount of available side missions. &quot;GameSpy&quot;″s Alupului described the game&#x27;s story as &quot;well-paced&quot; and &quot;coherent&quot;, featuring plot elements akin to a mob film. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Gerstmann found the missions entertaining and challenging, but noted exploring the game world also offers &quot;a great deal of fun&quot; to players.

Reactions to the game&#x27;s controls were mixed. Alupului of &quot;GameSpy&quot; found the game &quot;controls beautifully&quot;, both while driving and on-foot. &quot;Game Revolution&quot;″s Silverman identified the control issues as the game&#x27;s only flaw, although praised the responsiveness of the driving mechanics. Matt Helgeson of &quot;Game Informer&quot; similarly described the driving as &quot;great&quot;, but noted &quot;clunky&quot; combat. &quot;GamePro&quot;″s Four-Eyed Dragon found the cars simple to manoeuvre. &quot;Edge&quot; described the game&#x27;s combat as &quot;an awkward system that stymies play&quot;. &quot;1UP.com&quot; noted particular flaws in the targeting system, explaining it &quot;often focuses on the wrong guy&quot;.

==== Windows version ====
When &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; was released for Windows in May 2002, it received similar acclaim. Metacritic calculated an average score of 93 out of 100, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;, based on 20 reviews; it is the highest-rated 2002 Windows game on Metacritic. Reviewers liked the visual enhancements and control improvements, but criticised the port for its demanding system requirements.

The in-game features and controls in the port were generally well received. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Tal Blevins praised the higher precision of the mouse controls, finding the aiming mechanic more precise. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Erik Wolpaw also commended the mouse controls, but disapproved the replay system, particularly due to the lack of options with timing and camera controls. &quot;Extended Play&quot;″s Andrew Bub appreciated the addition of a custom radio station, as well as the availability of custom skins. Daniel Morris of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; praised the gameplay tweaks provided by the port but criticised the lack of major additional features, such as an overhead map of the in-game city.

The port&#x27;s visuals received a positive response from reviewers. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Wolpaw praised the port&#x27;s reworked textures but criticised the frequent popup and the advanced system requirements. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Blevins similarly criticised the necessity of an advanced system for stable play, but ultimately felt the port looks &quot;a bit nicer&quot; than the original game. &quot;GameSpy&quot;″s Sal Accardo felt the port &quot;looks much sharper&quot; than the PlayStation 2 version, though noted some &quot;choppy&quot; animations. &quot;Extended Play&quot;″s Bub mentioned the advanced settings resulted in slowdown and crashes. &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Matt Helgeson noticed little difference between the visuals of the original and the port.
==== Mobile version ====
When &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; was released to mobile devices in December 2011, it received generally positive reviews. Metacritic calculated an average score of 80 out of 100, based on 26 reviews. Reviewers liked the enhanced visuals, but criticism was directed at the touchscreen controls.

&quot;IGN&quot;″s Peter Eykemans commended the port&#x27;s smoother textures, especially condensed on a mobile screen, while &quot;Destructoid&quot;″s James Stephanie Sterling noted improvements in the character and vehicle models. Mark Walton of &quot;GameSpot&quot; wrote the game runs well on high-end devices like the Motorola Xoom and Samsung Galaxy S II, but noticed significant frame rate and texture issues on the Xperia Play. &quot;Pocket Gamer&quot;″s Mark Brown identified the game&#x27;s short draw distance leading to sudden popup, although still found the models and textures &quot;have been given a tune-up&quot; in the port.

The touchscreen controls received a mixed response. &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Dan Whitehead appreciated the driving mechanics, but felt moving on-foot is &quot;a flaky way of navigating&quot; the world, and criticised the &quot;clumsy&quot; shooting mechanics as most of the guns cannot be manually targeted. &quot;IGN&quot;″s Eykemans felt the controls &quot;make half the experience frustrating&quot;, and &quot;Destructoid&quot;″s Sterling described them as &quot;by far the biggest barrier toward enjoying&quot; the port. Brown of &quot;Pocket Gamer&quot; found the touchscreen &quot;hasn&#x27;t hindered [the game] too drastically&quot;, commending simple movement and &quot;effortless&quot; driving mechanics. Some critics identified better controls upon the use of external gamepads, but felt they hinder the game&#x27;s portability.

=== Accolades ===
&quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; received multiple nominations and awards from gaming publications. It was awarded Game of the Year at the 2nd Game Developers Choice Awards, and from GameSpot and GameSpy. It was named the Best PlayStation 2 Game by &quot;Game Revolution&quot;, &quot;GameSpot&quot;, &quot;GameSpy&quot;, and &quot;IGN&quot;. It also won Best Action Game from &quot;Game Revolution&quot;, &quot;GameSpot&quot;, and &quot;IGN&quot;; Most Innovative from &quot;GameSpot&quot;; and Excellence in Game Design at the Game Developers Choice Awards. &quot;GameSpy&quot; also awarded the game Most Offensive, Best Use of Radio, and tied for Best Artificial Intelligence. It won the Global Award at the 7th CESA Game Awards in 2003 and an Award for Excellence at the 8th CESA Game Awards in 2004. At the 5th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; won Outstanding Achievement in Game Design and Outstanding Achievement in Game Play Engineering, and was nominated for Console Action/Adventure Game of the Year. The following year at the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Windows version won Computer Action/Adventure Game of the Year and was nominated for Outstanding Innovation in Computer Gaming.

== Sales ==
In the United States, &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; was the highest-selling game of 2001, selling over two million units by February 2002. The game was also the second-best-selling game of 2002, only behind its sequel, &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot;. Take-Two stock significantly increased following the game&#x27;s launch, and the game was included in PlayStation&#x27;s Greatest Hits selection. Within a year of release, the game had sold six million copies and generated over in revenue; by January 2003, it had sold seven million and generated over . In the United States, the game had sold 5.35 million units by June 2004, and 6.55 million units by December 2007. The Windows version accounted for 420,000 sales and $16.9 million in earnings by August 2006 in the United States, where it was the 34th-best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006.

In Japan, &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; sold around 75,000 copies in its first day, 120,000 in its first week, and roughly 300,000 by December 2003. The number rose above 350,000 copies by January 2008. In Europe, over a million copies of the game were reportedly sold by December 2001. The game earned a &quot;Diamond&quot; award in the United Kingdom, indicating over one million sales; it was the first game to receive this award in the region. The game became one of the best-selling PlayStation 2 games with 11.6 million copies sold, and sold 14.5 million units overall by March 2008.

== Controversies ==
&quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; generated several controversies. &quot;GameSpy&quot; awarded it &quot;Most Offensive Game of the Year&quot;; calling it &quot;absolutely reprehensible&quot;, they wrote the game rewards players for &quot;causing mayhem&quot; and &quot;killing innocent people by the dozen&quot;, questioning its appropriateness. The notoriety led American retailer Wal-Mart to check identification of purchasers who appeared under the age of 17 when purchasing mature games. In an essay, assistant professor Shira Chess identified the lack of consequence to player violence due to the ability to respawn upon death or incarceration, and found it denies the &quot;reality of mortality and simultaneously [forces] it on players&quot;. Benzies claimed the violence was intended as comedic and the game is &quot;not meant to be taken seriously&quot;, and Dan Houser said the team was conscious of the offence the game would attract, but &quot;never marketed it in a way that exploited that&quot;.

The game allows players to participate in sexual activities with prostitutes and murder them to reclaim the payment, which was met with widespread controversy. The game also received some backlash for its depiction of crime and allowing violence against police officers. Psychologist David Walsh of the National Institute on Media and the Family said the game &quot;glamorizes antisocial and criminal activity&quot;, and &quot;the purpose of the game is to perpetrate crime&quot;. In response, &quot;Kotaku&quot; writer Owen Good wrote the game does not reward players for &quot;proficiency at crime, no matter how much it is accused of doing so&quot;. Joanna Weiss of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; noted the &quot;adrenaline&quot; players feel when committing crimes in the game, excusing its violence due to its mature classification. In January 2002, the National Organization for Women called for Rockstar and Take-Two to withdraw the game from sale as it &quot;encourages violence and the degradation of women&quot;. Matt Richtel of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote the activities within the game &quot;crossed the line into bad taste&quot;.

&quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; was initially released in Australia with an MA15+ classification, but the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) later banned it after re-reviewing, citing its sexual content and violence against prostitutes. After Take-Two appealed, the OFLC reaffirmed its ban on 11 December 2001, having reanalysed the game alongside a forensic psychologist. Take-Two recalled the game in Australia and Rockstar made appropriate changes; a modified version was released with an MA15+ classification in January 2002, removing instances of sexual acts with prostitutes. The game was re-rated with an R18+ classification in September 2019, citing &quot;sexual activities related to incentives and rewards&quot;. In Japan, the game was designated &quot;harmful&quot; for children in Kanagawa Prefecture in June 2005, essentially removing it from open shelves; Capcom criticised the decision and considered legal action but did not pursue further, and the designation ultimately led to a sales increase.

On 25 June 2003, teenage stepbrothers William and Josh Buckner shot at motorists, killing Aaron Hamel and wounding Kimberly Bede. In statements to investigators, the perpetrators claimed their actions were inspired by &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;. In response, on 20 October 2003, the families of Hamel and Bede filed a US$246 million lawsuit against Rockstar, Take-Two, Sony Computer Entertainment and Wal-Mart. Rockstar and Take-Two filed for dismissal of the lawsuit, stating in United States district court on 29 October 2003 that the &quot;ideas and concepts&quot;, and the &quot;purported psychological effects&quot; of the perpetrators, are protected by the First Amendment&#x27;s free-speech clause. Jack Thompson, the lawyer representing the victims, denied Rockstar&#x27;s claims and attempted to move the lawsuit into a state court for consideration under Tennessee&#x27;s consumer protection act.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; has been frequently included among the greatest video games of all time. In 2007, &quot;GamePro&quot; called &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; the most important video game of all time, explaining the &quot;game&#x27;s open-ended gameplay elements have revolutionized the way all video games are made&quot;. Similarly, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked the game among the &quot;Top 10 Most Influential Games&quot;, and &quot;GameSpot&quot; listed it among the greatest games of all time. In 2009, &quot;Game Informer&quot; wrote that &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; &quot;changed the gaming landscape forever with its immersive open world sandbox&quot;, and in 2016, &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; named it the &quot;most important game&quot; of the 2000s. &quot;Time&quot; named it one of the greatest video games of all time in November 2012 and August 2016. The game was selected as part of the Game On touring exhibition, demonstrating some of the game&#x27;s development plans and artwork. In 2016, The Strong National Museum of Play inducted &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; to its World Video Game Hall of Fame.

&quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; is considered to have a leading role in the popularisation of sandbox games, inspiring those such as &quot;Crackdown&quot;, &quot;Mafia&quot;, &quot;Saints Row&quot;, &quot;True Crime&quot;, and &quot;Watch Dogs&quot;. The term &quot;&quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; clone&quot; is frequently used to describe subsequent video games released with similar open-ended gameplay as &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;. While previous video games used open world design, including earlier &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; games, &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; took this gameplay foundation and expanded it into a 3D world, offering an unprecedented variety of minigames and side-missions. Journalist and consultant Tom Bramwell felt the game did not invent a lot of its gameplay features, but &quot;brought them all together&quot;. Due to its greater success over its predecessors, it is credited with popularising the open-world genre; Dan Houser felt the game made it &quot;one of the most vibrant genres today&quot;, and Garbut felt it led to the complexities of Rockstar&#x27;s future open world games, including the later &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; games and &quot;Red Dead Redemption 2&quot; (2018). &quot;IGN&quot;″s Jack Harwood thought the game&#x27;s talk radio station inspired similar inclusions in other open world games, such as &quot;Mafia III&quot; (2016) and &quot;Watch Dogs: Legion&quot; (2020).

The game also led the trend of mature video games; Dan Houser felt it allowed other developers to create violent shooters. Hal Halpin, president of the Entertainment Consumers Association, described &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; as the &quot;lightning rod for the violence-in-games debate&quot;. &quot;Metro&quot;″s Roger Hargreaves wrote it &quot;emboldened a whole new wave of games that were ... fixated with violence [and] gang culture&quot;. Greg Ford of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; felt the game allowed the medium to handle mature subject matter in a more serious manner than previously perceived, and noted the improvement of video game classification as a result of its controversy. King said video games at the time were often associated with children or nerds, and the development team &quot;wanted the rest of the entertainment industry to pay attention&quot; and understand the medium could also contain mature, adult content.

Following the success, Rockstar developed further games in the series. &quot;Vice City&quot; and &quot;San Andreas&quot; are set in their titular locations in 1986 and 1992, respectively. &quot;Grand Theft Auto Advance&quot; (2004) is set in Liberty City roughly a year before the events of &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;. &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories&quot; (2005) takes place three years before the events of &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; in the same rendition of Liberty City. A completely redesigned version of the city was later used in &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; (2008), &quot;The Lost and Damned&quot; (2009), &quot;The Ballad of Gay Tony&quot; (2009), and &quot;Chinatown Wars&quot; (2009).

=== Ports ===
&quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; was released on 21 May 2002 for Windows, supporting higher screen resolutions and draw distance, and featuring more detailed textures. Analysts believed the game would eventually release on GameCube, though it never materialised. &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot; was bundled with &quot;Vice City&quot; in the compilation &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Double Pack&quot;, released on the Xbox on 4 November 2003 in North America and 2 January 2004 in Europe. The Xbox version featured a custom soundtrack support as well as improved audio, polygon models, and reflections over the previous ports. &quot;Double Pack&quot; was later bundled with &quot;San Andreas&quot; as part of &quot;Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy&quot;, released in October 2005. &quot;The Trilogy&quot; was also released for OS X on 12 November 2010. On 15 December 2011, for the game&#x27;s tenth anniversary, War Drum Studios ported the game to iOS and Android; this port is almost identical to the Windows version, with the addition of enhanced models and textures and touchscreen controls. This port was also released on Fire OS on 15 May 2014. A PlayStation 3 version was released on 25 September 2012 via the PlayStation Network. The original PlayStation 2 version was released for the PlayStation 4 as a PS2 Classics game, on 5 December 2015. In 2012, a modding community under the name RAGE Classic Team ported the map over to &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot;, named &quot;Grand Theft Auto III: RAGE Classic&quot;.

An enhanced version of &quot;The Trilogy,&quot; &quot;The Definitive Edition&quot;, including &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;, was released for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on 11 November 2021, to celebrate the game&#x27;s twentieth anniversary, and for Android and iOS on 14 December 2023. Existing versions of the game were removed from digital retailers in preparation for &quot;The Definitive Edition&quot;, but later restored as a bundle on the Rockstar Store.

A core team of six fans reverse-engineered the game and released it as an executable in April 2020, having worked on it since 2016. The project, &quot;re3&quot;, allows the game to be unofficially ported to platforms such as Nintendo Switch, PlayStation Vita, and Wii U. Take-Two issued a DMCA takedown for the project in February 2021, though it was restored in June after the team filed a counter-notice. In September 2021, Take-Two filed a lawsuit in California against the programmers, asserting the projects constitute copyright infringement. In July 2024, fan developer SKMP started creating a Dreamcast port, seen as a significant undertaking due to the console&#x27;s limited memory; it was released in December.

<text>Dorothy Ruth Hoogstraten (February 28, 1960 – August 14, 1980), known professionally as Dorothy Stratten, was a Canadian model and actress, primarily known for her appearances as a Playboy Playmate. Stratten was the &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate of the Month for August 1979 and Playmate of the Year in 1980, and appeared in three comedy films and in several episodes of television shows broadcast on American networks. Stratten was murdered shortly after co-starring in the movie &quot;They All Laughed&quot;, at the age of 20, by her estranged husband and manager Paul Snider, whom she was in the process of divorcing and breaking business ties with. Snider committed suicide after he killed Stratten. 

Stratten&#x27;s death inspired two movies, a book, and several songs: the TV movie &quot;Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story&quot; (1981), the theatrical motion picture &quot;Star 80&quot; (1983), the book &quot;The Killing of the Unicorn&quot; (1984), and songs such as &quot;The Best Was Yet to Come&quot; by Bryan Adams, and &quot;Cover Girl&quot; by Prism.

==Life and career==
Dorothy Stratten was born in Grace Maternity Hospital in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, on February 28, 1960, to Simon and Nelly Hoogstraten, who had emigrated from the Netherlands. In 1961, her brother John Arthur was born; her sister Louise followed in May 1968.

In 1977, Stratten was attending Centennial High School in Coquitlam. Centennial classmates remember Dorothy as &quot;sweet and kind.&quot; One friend, Leslie Buchanan, recalls: &quot;The crowd that Dorothy hung out with were party people. They weren&#x27;t the sports crowd, just kind of a very cool group.&quot; Concurrently, she was working part-time at a local Dairy Queen, where she met 26-year-old Vancouver-area club promoter and pimp Paul Snider, who began dating her. Snider later had a photographer take professional nude photos of Stratten which were sent to &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine in the summer of 1978. She was under the age of 19 (the legal age of majority in British Columbia), so she had to persuade her mother to sign the model release form.

In August 1978, Stratten moved to Los Angeles, California, United States, where she was chosen as a finalist for the 25th Anniversary Great Playmate Hunt. Snider joined her in October, and they married in June the following year. With her surname shortened to Stratten, she became &quot;Playboy&#x27;s&quot; Miss August 1979 and began working as a bunny at the Playboy Club in Century City, Los Angeles. Hugh Hefner had high hopes that Stratten could have meaningful crossover success as an actress. She featured in episodes of the television series &quot;Buck Rogers&quot; and &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; in 1979. Also that year, she had small roles in the films &quot;Americathon&quot;, the roller disco comedy &quot;Skatetown, U.S.A.&quot;, and a lead role in the exploitation film &quot;Autumn Born&quot;, all released in 1979.

Hefner was told by Playboy employees that Stratten should sever ties with Snider. In a documentary about Stratten, Hefner says that he tried to warn Stratten about Snider but that he was in a tough position. Rosanne Katon and other friends also warned Stratten about Snider&#x27;s behavior. 

===March 1980 – July 1980===
On March 22, 1980, Stratten flew to New York City to begin work on what became her last film project, &quot;They All Laughed&quot; (1981), a romantic comedy being directed by Peter Bogdanovich. This would be Stratten&#x27;s fifth movie in a career that had only begun the year before and represented her first substantial role in a big-budget picture, playing the unhappily-married love interest of John Ritter, one of the film&#x27;s stars. Bogdanovich, who also wrote the screenplay, said in an interview that he had based the backstory of Stratten&#x27;s character on what he had learned about her marriage to Snider. Stratten and Bogdanovich began an affair during the production.

Stratten had spent the first two and a half months of 1980 completing her Playmate of the Year shoot and making her previous movie, &quot;Galaxina&quot;, in southern California. With all her work close to home, Snider assumed the role of his wife&#x27;s chauffeur, as well as her ersatz manager and acting coach. However, Snider&#x27;s near-constant presence, as well as his criticism of and almost daily arguments with his wife, caused Stratten so much stress that her co-workers at &quot;Playboy&quot; and the &quot;Galaxina&quot; set took notice of the tension in the relationship. As the spring of 1980 approached, Snider insisted on accompanying his wife to New York for the shoot for &quot;They All Laughed&quot;, but Stratten recognized the problems he could cause on set and wanted the freedom to pursue her relationship with Bogdanovich. Stratten convinced Snider to remain in Los Angeles after explaining that the director had decided to close the set of his new film to all but the cast and immediate crew. Stratten and Bogdanovich consummated their affair on the day after her arrival in New York.

In April, Stratten briefly returned to California to prepare for her upcoming introduction as the new Playmate of the Year and follow-on publicity tour. With several months of filming left to be completed in New York, this was the last time that she would live with Snider in their Los Angeles–area home.
On Wednesday, April 30, at a luncheon held on the grounds of the Playboy Mansion, Stratten was presented to the assembled entertainment press as the 1980 Playmate of the Year. In his introductory remarks, Hefner noted that Stratten was from Canada and had received $200,000 in cash and gifts in addition to the title. In a fleeting comment, he also acknowledged the effect that Stratten&#x27;s charming combination of beauty, intelligence, and sensitivity had on many who knew her when he said, &quot;...and she is something rather special. They always are, but Dorothy is really quite unique.&quot; After taking the lectern, Stratten thanked Mario Casilli, the photographer who shot both her Playmate of the Month and Year pictorials, several Playboy executives, and finally Hefner, whom she declared &quot;has made me probably the happiest girl in the world today.&quot; Later that evening, Stratten appeared as a guest on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;.

The next day, Stratten began a two-week promotional tour in Canada. Having no events scheduled over the first weekend, she flew to New York on a whim to surprise Bogdanovich. Increasingly conflicted about her marriage, Stratten wrote to Snider from Canada asking for more freedom in their relationship. With his wife beyond his immediate control and fearing the worst, Snider telephoned from Los Angeles in response and flew into a rage when Stratten answered. Stratten&#x27;s tour was arranged to end in her hometown of Vancouver so Stratten might relax for a few days with family before returning to New York. However, Snider appeared in Vancouver at the last minute and coerced her into spending some of her brief vacation making personal appearances at several local nightclubs. Since Snider knew many of the club owners, he personally negotiated and collected Stratten&#x27;s appearance fees and then pocketed the entire sum when she returned to New York. During this time, it was reported that Stratten and Snider had a particularly heated argument. At some point during the fight, Stratten offered to give up her acting career and suggested the couple permanently return to Canada; however, Snider rebuffed his wife&#x27;s attempt to save their marriage.

In the days and weeks after Snider returned to Los Angeles, he found it increasingly difficult to get in touch with Stratten. In late June, just a few weeks after their first wedding anniversary, Snider received another letter from Stratten, this one announcing that they were now physically and financially separated. Snider had several responses to the second letter; he emptied the couple&#x27;s joint bank account, he had a brief affair with an old girlfriend, and, now convinced that Stratten was having an affair of her own with Bogdanovich, hired a private detective to gather evidence of his wife&#x27;s infidelity.

As a foreign national living in the U.S. without a green card that would allow him to hold a job and having no other source of regular income, Snider relied on Stratten, now through her business manager, to pay the monthly household bills. Little was left over for extravagances, such as the expenses incurred by a private detective working a case 3,000 miles from home. Therefore, over the summer of 1980, Snider began selling Stratten&#x27;s Playmate of the Year prizes at a loss for quick cash, the most notable example being a Jaguar sportscar that &quot;Playboy&quot; had valued at $26,000.

By mid-July, principal photography on &quot;They All Laughed&quot; was completed and the New York production wrapped. On Wednesday, July 30, Stratten and Bogdanovich returned to Los Angeles after having spent a ten-day holiday together in England. Stratten&#x27;s official Los Angeles residence was now at the address of a newly rented Beverly Hills apartment, but in actuality she had quietly moved into Bogdanovich&#x27;s mansion in Bel Air.

===August 1980===
On the night of July 31, 1980, Snider, by now aware that his estranged wife was back in Los Angeles and living with Bogdanovich, hid among the shadows just outside the director&#x27;s estate carrying a borrowed handgun, intending to shoot anyone who appeared at the entrance to the property. After several hours of inactivity, Snider grew impatient and left, drove up into the hills overlooking the city and, he admitted later to a friend, had thoughts of suicide.

At approximately noon on Friday, August 8, Stratten and Snider saw each other for the first time in nearly three months at Snider&#x27;s (and Stratten&#x27;s former) house in West Los Angeles. After having already persuaded Stratten to pose for &quot;Playboy&quot; and then marry him, Snider was supremely confident before the meeting that he would convince his wife to take him back. But his hopes of a reconciliation were quickly dashed when Stratten admitted that she had fallen in love with Bogdanovich and wanted to finalize their separation. A dejected Snider agreed to meet Stratten one more time the following week to discuss a monetary settlement. Later that afternoon, less than a week before Stratten&#x27;s murder, Snider had to return the borrowed gun to its owner. Over the next five days, he would become obsessed with getting another.

On August 9, the day after his meeting with Stratten, Snider and the private detective he had hired went to a local gun store. After being told that the store could not sell him a firearm because of his Canadian citizenship, Snider asked the private detective to buy the gun Snider wanted for him; the detective refused. When Snider saw the private detective again the following day, he tried to convince the man to buy him a machine gun for &quot;home protection&quot;, but the detective talked him out of the idea. The next day, August 11, Snider drove out into the San Fernando Valley to look at a gun he had found for sale in a newspaper. He got lost, however, and eventually gave up and went home before finding the owner&#x27;s address.

==Murder==

On August 13, 1980 the second anniversary of Stratten&#x27;s first arrival in Los Angeles Snider bought a used 12-gauge, pump-action shotgun from a private seller he found in a local classified ad. Later that evening in a conversation with friends, Snider described how he had purchased a gun that day and finished his story by declaring that he was &quot;going to take up hunting.&quot; Snider casually brought up the subject of Playmates who had unexpectedly died; in particular, he spoke of Claudia Jennings, an actress and former Playmate of the Year who had been killed in a car accident the year before. Snider made several morbid remarks to his companions related to the problems at &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine caused by Jennings&#x27; death, including a comment about how the editors would pull nude photos of a dead Playmate from the next issue if there was time.

Stratten arrived for her meeting with Snider at his rented West Los Angeles house at approximately noon on Thursday, August 14. She had spent the morning conferring with her business manager, and one of the topics the pair discussed was the amount of the property settlement Stratten would offer her estranged husband that afternoon. The police later found $1,100 in cash among Stratten&#x27;s belongings in the house, which she had apparently brought for Snider as a down payment. Towards the end of her morning meeting, Stratten&#x27;s business manager made an observation: that his young client could avoid spending any more time with Snider by handing off the remaining separation and divorce negotiations to her lawyer. Stratten replied that the process would go easier if she dealt with Snider personally, explaining that he was being nice about everything and finally adding, &quot;I&#x27;d like to remain his friend.&quot; 
Snider&#x27;s two roommates had left in the morning, so the couple was alone when Stratten stepped into the house that she had shared with her husband until just a few months earlier. By all appearances, Stratten had spent some time in the living room, where her purse was found lying open, before she and Snider went into his bedroom.

By 8:00 that evening, both of the roommates had returned to the house. They saw Stratten&#x27;s car parked out front and noted that Snider&#x27;s bedroom door was closed. Assuming that the couple had reconciled and wanted their privacy, the roommates spent the next several hours watching television in the living room.

Alerted by Snider&#x27;s private detective who phoned expressing concern after not hearing from Snider all day, the roommates entered the bedroom shortly after 11:00 P.M. and discovered the bodies of Stratten and Snider. Each had been killed by a single blast from Snider&#x27;s shotgun. Both bodies were nude. According to the police timeline and from the forensic evidence collected at the crime scene, Snider had shot Stratten that afternoon within an hour of her arrival at the house, then committed suicide approximately one hour after the murder.

Some time after midnight in the early morning of August 15, the private detective telephoned the Playboy Mansion and told Hefner that Stratten had been murdered. Hefner then called Bogdanovich. After collapsing at the news, Bogdanovich was sedated. Stratten&#x27;s mother was told of her daughter&#x27;s death at her Vancouver-area home later that morning by an officer of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

Stratten&#x27;s body was cremated and the remains interred at the Westwood Village Memorial Park cemetery in Los Angeles. The epitaph on Stratten&#x27;s grave marker includes a passage, chosen by Bogdanovich, from Chapter 34 of the Ernest Hemingway novel &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;. Three years after the murder, the author&#x27;s granddaughter, Mariel Hemingway, played Stratten in &quot;Star 80&quot;, the Bob Fosse biopic about the doomed Playmate and her husband. Bogdanovich was interred next to her remains following his death in 2022.

==Aftermath of Stratten&#x27;s murder==

===Bogdanovich and &quot;They All Laughed&quot;===

In August 1981, a year after Stratten&#x27;s death, her final film, the romantic comedy &quot;They All Laughed&quot;, which was written and directed by Bogdanovich, had its U.S. release. After a disappointing limited run in a handful of theaters in the southwest, the upper midwest, and the northeast, the picture was quietly withdrawn.

Upset that what would be his only project with Stratten did not have a nationwide release, and determined that her last screen performance have a chance to be seen by a broader audience, Bogdanovich bought the theatrical rights to the picture. Out of his own pocket, he paid for a re-release of &quot;They All Laughed&quot; in nearly a dozen large markets across North America beginning in late 1981 and rolling into the following year. Despite generally favorable reviews and strong attendance in some theaters, Bogdanovich ultimately sank more than five million dollars, his entire net worth at the time, into the project to properly promote and distribute the movie and rescue Stratten&#x27;s film legacy.

Bogdanovich declared bankruptcy in 1985. In the process, he lost his Los Angeles home where Stratten had lived for the last few weeks of her life.

In the years since its inauspicious debut, &quot;They All Laughed&quot; has been recognized by filmmakers, critics, and others as being one of Bogdanovich&#x27;s best pictures. &quot;One Day Since Yesterday&quot;, a documentary about the making and cultural importance of Bogdanovich&#x27;s romantic comedy, which includes interviews with the director and his remembrances of Stratten, premiered in 2014.

===&quot;The Killing of the Unicorn&quot;===

In August 1984, four years after Stratten&#x27;s death, the publisher William Morrow released a book by Bogdanovich titled &quot;The Killing of the Unicorn: Dorothy Stratten 1960-1980&quot;.

&quot;The Killing of the Unicorn&quot; is, by turns, a biography of Stratten, a memoir of Bogdanovich&#x27;s affair with the married Playmate who was half his age, and a scathing, feminist attack on Hefner, his Playboy philosophy, and the hedonistic sexual mores he celebrated in his magazine and practiced at his mansion, and the entire Playboy organization. By far the most controversial part of the book is the director&#x27;s claim that Hefner had sexually assaulted a then eighteen-year-old Stratten in August 1978. According to Bogdanovich&#x27;s allegation the assault occurred while the two were alone in a secluded area of the Playboy Mansion at the end of Stratten&#x27;s first day of posing for the magazine&#x27;s photographer. (Bogdanovich chose to use the word &quot;seduced&quot; to describe Hefner&#x27;s behavior in the book; however, he originally used the word &quot;raped&quot; in the drafts of his manuscript. Bogdanovich and the publisher made the change after being threatened with a lawsuit by Hefner and his lawyers.)

Among the other allegations that Bogdanovich made in his book, the most significant are: 1) That Stratten had not married Snider out of love, but rather used her marriage as an excuse to block the advances of Hefner who, Bogdanovich claimed, pursued Stratten as a sexual partner after the purported assault, 2) That Stratten loathed nude modeling and dealing with Playboy in general, and only tolerated the humiliating work in order to promote her acting career, and 3) That Hefner was responsible, in part, for enabling Snider&#x27;s killing rage when he was banned from entering the Playboy Mansion just days before the murder. Bogdanovich&#x27;s underlying assertion for the last charge is that Snider was banned because Hefner hated the man. In his defense, Hefner explained that the purpose of the ban was to encourage Stratten and Bogdanovich to appear at the mansion as a couple.

Nearly every review of &quot;The Killing of the Unicorn&quot; in the U.S. press was negative. While few objected to Bogdanovich&#x27;s attacks on Hefner and &quot;Playboy&quot;, many were skeptical of his newfound feminism, pointing out, for example, that he &quot;seemed oblivious to his own sexist susceptibility to &#x27;the whore/Madonna complex&#x27; in his view of women.&quot; The review that appeared in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, for instance, had its tone concisely summarized in the blunt headline that led off the piece, &quot;Shabby little shocker.&quot; Film critic Roger Ebert, writing for the crosstown &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, managed to express empathy for Bogdanovich and the tragedy of Stratten&#x27;s death, but was no less critical, stating that he could understand why Bogdanovich felt the need to write the book, &quot;but I wish he hadn&#x27;t published it.&quot;

In an article that appeared shortly after the murder, Hefner, who was 33 years older than Stratten, used the word &quot;friendship&quot; to describe his relationship with her and was said to see himself as a &quot;father figure&quot; to the Playmate. The image that Hefner presented to the public as a supportive, benevolent, paternal figure to Stratten was emphasized the following spring when &quot;Playboy&quot; published her biography in its May 1981 issue. It was reported that Hefner had personally supervised the editing of the article.

In 1985, when asked again about his relationship with Stratten after the release of &quot;The Killing of the Unicorn&quot;, Hefner did concede to a crucial detail that lay at the heart of Bogdanovich&#x27;s allegation. Namely, Hefner admitted that several weeks after Stratten first arrived in Los Angeles, the two had taken a nude soak in the Jacuzzi on the Playboy Mansion grounds, the place where Bogdanovich claimed the sexual assault had occurred. In the same interview, while allowing that they had &quot;hugged&quot; in the Jacuzzi, Hefner denied having forced himself on Stratten. Hefner also denied, despite his reputation, that he had ever so much as made a pass at the young Canadian, suggesting that his sexual interest in Stratten had ended in the Jacuzzi after learning that she expected to become engaged to her boyfriend. (This conversation would have occurred approximately two months before Hefner first met Snider.)

==Legacy==
Stratten&#x27;s murder was depicted in two films. In the made-for-television &quot;Death of a Centerfold: The Dorothy Stratten Story&quot; (1981), Jamie Lee Curtis portrayed Stratten and Bruce Weitz played Paul Snider. Bob Fosse&#x27;s feature film &quot;Star 80&quot; (1983) starred Mariel Hemingway as Stratten and Eric Roberts as Snider.

In 1983, film critic Vincent Canby wrote &quot;Miss Stratten possessed a charming screen presence and might possibly have become a first-rate comedienne with time and work&quot;.

In December 1988, at age 49, Bogdanovich married Stratten&#x27;s sister, Louise, who was 20. Bogdanovich had paid for Louise&#x27;s private schooling and modeling classes following Stratten&#x27;s death. They divorced in 2001 after being married for 13 years.

Singer-songwriter Bryan Adams, along with co-writer Jim Valance, wrote the song &quot;The Best Was Yet to Come&quot; as the closing track for Adams&#x27; 1983 LP &quot;Cuts Like a Knife&quot; as a dedication to Dorothy Stratten. Adams also co-wrote with Lindsay Mitchell of the Canadian band Prism the track &quot;Cover Girl&quot; for their greatest hits collection &quot;All the Best From Prism&quot; (1980), which had not appeared on any prior album.

Bush&#x27;s song &quot;Dead Meat&quot; is written in her memory. &quot;Californication&quot; by the Red Hot Chili Peppers makes reference to her.

Actress Nicola Peltz portrays Stratten in the Hulu miniseries &quot;Welcome to Chippendales&quot;.

<doc id="362647" wikidata="Q361369" url="?curid=362647" title="Theobald II, Count of Champagne">
<text>Theobald the Great (1090–1152) was count of Blois and of Chartres as Theobald IV from 1102 and was Count of Champagne and of Brie as Theobald II from 1125. Theobald held Auxerre, Maligny, Ervy, Troyes and Châteauvillain as fiefs from Odo II, Duke of Burgundy.

==Career==
Theobald was the son of Count Stephen II of Blois and his wife Adela of Normandy (daughter of William the Conqueror), and the elder brother of King Stephen of England.

Although he was the second son, Theobald was appointed above his older brother William. Theobald accompanied his mother throughout their domain on hundreds of occasions and, after her retirement to Marcigney in 1125, he administered the family properties with great skill. Adela died in her beloved convent on 8 March 1137, the year after her son Stephen was crowned king of England.

King Louis VII of France became involved in a war with Theobald by permitting Count Raoul I of Vermandois, seneschal of France, to repudiate his wife Eleanor, sister of Theobald and of King Stephan, in order to marry Petronilla of Aquitaine, sister of Louis VII&#x27;s own wife, Eleanor. The war, which lasted two years (1142–1144), was marked by the occupation of Champagne by the royal army and the capture of Vitry-le-François, where 1500 people perished in the deliberate burning of the church by Louis.

The scholastic Pierre Abélard, famous for his love affair with and subsequent marriage to his student Héloïse d&#x27;Argenteuil, sought asylum in Champagne during Theobald II&#x27;s reign. Abelard died at Cluny Abbey in Burgundy, a monastery supported by the Thebaudians for many centuries.

==Marriage and issue==
In 1123 he married Matilda, daughter of Duke Engelbert of Carinthia. Their children were:
* Henry I of Champagne, count of Champagne
* Theobald V of Blois, count of Blois and seneschal of France
* Adela, queen of France as the wife of King Louis VII of France
* Isabella, married 1. Duke Roger III of Apulia d. 1148, 2. William Gouet IV d. 1170 
* Marie, married Duke Odo II of Burgundy, became abbess of Fontevrault later in life.
* Stephen I of Sancerre 1133–1191, count of Sancerre and crusader, died at the Siege of Acre
* William White Hands, 1135–1202, archbishop of Reims 1176–1202, Cardinal 1179
* Agnes (d. 1207), dame de Ligny, married Renaut II of Bar (d. 1170).
* Margaret, nun at Fontevrault
* Matilda, married Rotrou IV of Perche

Theobald had an illegitimate son, Hugh, (d. 1171), abbot of Lagny near Paris.

<text>Stanisław Saks (30 December 1897 – 23 November 1942) was a Polish mathematician and university tutor, a member of the Lwów School of Mathematics, known primarily for his membership in the Scottish Café circle, an extensive monograph on the theory of integrals, his works on measure theory and the Vitali–Hahn–Saks theorem.

==Life and work==

Stanisław Saks was born on 30 December 1897 in Kalisz, Congress Poland, to an assimilated Polish-Jewish family. In 1915 he graduated from a local gymnasium and joined the newly recreated Warsaw University. In 1922 he received a doctorate of his &quot;alma mater&quot; with a prestigious distinction &quot;maxima cum laude&quot;. Soon afterwards he also passed his habilitation and received the Rockefeller fellowship, which allowed him to travel to the United States. Around that time he started publishing articles in various mathematical journals, mostly the &quot;Fundamenta Mathematicae&quot;, but also in the &quot;Transactions of the American Mathematical Society&quot;. He participated in the Silesian Uprisings and was awarded the Cross of the Valorous and the Medal of Independence for his bravery. Following the end of the uprising he returned to Warsaw and resumed his academic career.

For most of it he studied the theories of functions and functionals in particular. In 1930 he published his most notable book, the &quot;Zarys teorii całki&quot; (Sketch on the Theory of the Integral), which later got expanded and translated into several languages, including English (&quot;Theory of the Integral&quot;), French (&quot;Théorie de l&#x27;Intégrale&quot;) and Russian (&quot;Teoriya Integrala&quot;). Despite his successes, Saks was never awarded the title of professor and remained an ordinary tutor, initially at his alma mater and the Warsaw University of Technology, and later at the Lwów University and Wilno University. He was also an active socialist and a journalist at the &quot;Robotnik&quot; weekly (1919–1926) and later a collaborator of the Association of Socialist Youth.

Saks wrote a mathematics book with Antoni Zygmund, &quot;Analytic Functions&quot;, in 1933. It was translated into English in 1952 by E. J. Scott. In the preface to the English edition, Zygmund writes:

Stanislaw Saks was a man of moral as well as physical courage, of rare intelligence and wit. To his colleagues and pupils he was an inspiration not only as a mathematician but as a human being. In the period between the two world wars he exerted great influence upon a whole generation of Polish mathematicians in Warsaw and Lwów. In November 1942, at the age of 45, Saks died in a Warsaw prison, victim of a policy of extermination.
After the outbreak of World War II and the occupation of Poland by Germany, Saks joined the Polish underground. Arrested in November 1942, he was executed on 23 November 1942 by the German Gestapo in Warsaw.

<text>The Scottish Café () was a café in Lwów, Poland (now Lviv, Ukraine) where, in the 1930s and 1940s, mathematicians from the Lwów School of Mathematics collaboratively discussed research problems, particularly in functional analysis and topology.

Stanisław Ulam recounts that the tables of the café had marble tops, so they could write in pencil, directly on the table, during their discussions. To keep the results from being lost, and after becoming annoyed with their writing directly on the table tops, Stefan Banach&#x27;s wife provided the mathematicians with a large notebook, which was used for writing the problems and answers and eventually became known as the &quot;Scottish Book&quot;. The book—a collection of solved, unsolved, and even probably unsolvable problems—could be borrowed by any of the guests of the café. Solving any of the problems was rewarded with prizes, with the most difficult and challenging problems having expensive prizes (during the Great Depression and on the eve of World War II), such as a bottle of fine brandy.

For problem 153, which was later recognized as being closely related to Stefan Banach&#x27;s &quot;basis problem&quot;, Stanisław Mazur offered the prize of a live goose. This problem was solved only in 1972 by Per Enflo, who was presented with the live goose in a ceremony that was broadcast throughout Poland.

The café building now houses the Szkocka Restaurant &amp; Bar (named for the original Scottish Café) and the Atlas Deluxe hotel at the street address of 27 Taras Shevchenko Prospekt.

<doc id="362652" wikidata="Q632327" url="?curid=362652" title="Carjacking">
<text>Carjacking is a robbery in which a motor vehicle is taken over. In contrast to car theft, carjacking is usually in the presence and knowledge of the victim. A common crime in many places in the world, carjacking has been the subject of legislative responses, criminology studies, prevention efforts as well as being heavily dramatized in major film releases. Commercial vehicles such as trucks and armored cars containing valuable cargo are common targets of carjacking attempts. Carjacking usually involves physical violence to the victim, or using the victim as a hostage. In rare cases, carjacking may also involve sexual assault.

==Etymology==
The word is a portmanteau of &quot;car&quot; and &quot;hijacking&quot;. The term was coined by reporter Scott Bowles and editor E. J. Mitchell with &quot;The Detroit News&quot; in 1991. &quot;The News&quot; first used the term in a report on the murder of Ruth Wahl, a 22-year-old Detroit drugstore cashier who was killed when she would not surrender her Suzuki Sidekick, and in an investigative report examining the rash of what Detroit Police call &quot;robbery armed unlawful driving away an automobile&quot; (in dispatch slang shortened to R.A.-YOU-Da) plaguing Detroit.
TV series CHiPs season 2 episode 20 airing 2/24/79 has the character Ponch, played by Erik Estrada, using the term carjacking.

==Studies==
A study published in the &quot;British Journal of Criminology&quot; in 2003 found that &quot;for all of the media attention it has received in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, carjacking remains an under-researched and poorly understood crime.&quot; The authors conducted semi-structured interviews with 28 active carjackers in St. Louis, Missouri, and based on these interviews concluded that &quot;the decision to commit a carjacking stems most directly from a situated interaction between particular sorts of perceived opportunities and particular sorts of perceived needs and desires, this decision is activated, mediated, and shaped by participation in urban street culture.&quot;

A study published in the &quot;Journal of Contemporary Ethnography&quot; in 2013 noted that &quot;carjacking requires offenders to neutralize victims who are inherently mobile and who can use their vehicles as both weapons and shields.&quot; The study noted that carjackers use fear to compel compliance from victims.

A 2008 paper by the Australian Institute of Criminology conceptualized carjackings as falling into four types based on method and motive: organized and instrumental, organized and acquisitive, opportunistic and instrumental, and opportunistic and acquisitive. An example of an &quot;organized and instrumental&quot; carjacking is a planned carjacking with a weapon to use the vehicle for ramming an ATM to steal cash. An example of an &quot;organized and acquisitive&quot; carjacking is a planned carjacking to sell the vehicle in a known market. An example of an &quot;opportunistic and instrumental&quot; carjacking is a carjacking without a weapon to sell &quot;vehicle/parts with no market in mind.&quot; An example of an &quot;opportunistic and acquisitive&quot; carjacking is a carjacking without a weapon to joyride.

A 2017 qualitative study published in &quot;Justice Quarterly&quot; examined auto theft and carjacking in the context of &quot;sanction threats&quot; that promoted fear and influenced &quot;crime preferences&quot; among criminals, thereby redirecting (&quot;channeling&quot;) criminal activity. The study showed that &quot;auto thieves are reluctant to embrace the violence of carjacking due to concerns over sanction threat severity they attributed to carjacking—both formal (higher sentences) and informal (victim resistance and retaliation). Meanwhile, the carjackers are reticent to enact auto theft because of the more uncertain and putatively greater risk of being surprised by victims, a fear that appears to overcome the enhanced long-term formal penalty of taking a vehicle by force.&quot;

==Prevention and response==
Common carjacking ruses include: (1) bumping the victim&#x27;s vehicle from behind, and taking the car when the victim gets out of the vehicle to assess damage and exchange information; (2) staging a fake car accident, sometimes with injuries, and stealing the vehicle of a passerby who stops to assist; (3) flashing lights or waving to get the victim&#x27;s attention, indicating that there is a problem with the victim&#x27;s car, and then taking the car once the victim pulls over; and (4) following a victim home, blocking the victim&#x27;s car in a driveway or in front of a gate.

Police departments, security agencies, and auto insurers have published lists of strategies for preventing and responding to carjackings. Common recommendations include:
* Staying alert and being aware of one&#x27;s surroundings
* Parking in well-lighted areas
* Keeping vehicle doors locked and windows up
* Avoiding unfamiliar or high-crime areas
* Alerting police as soon as is safely possible following a carjacking
* Avoid isolated and less-well-trafficked parking lots, ATMs, pay phones, etc.
* When stopped in traffic, keeping some distance between the vehicle in front, so one can pull away easily if necessary.
* If confronted, it is often safer to give up the vehicle and avoid resisting

==Truck carjacking==
Commercial vehicles such as trucks and armored cars may be targets of carjacking attempts. Such carjackings may be aimed at stealing cargo, such as liquor, cigarettes, valuable goods, consumer electronics or even drugs. In other cases, a carjacked truck may be used to commit another crime, such as robbery or a terrorist attack.

Knowledge of the location of a truck carrying valuable cargo often requires inside information, and sometimes truck drivers collude with truck carjackers to facilitate the truck carjacking. This crime is often perpetuated by organized crime operations or by career criminals, or by a collaboration between the two. In particular, La Cosa Nostra has been known to orchestrate the carjacking of trucks (at locations such as Kennedy Airport in which a truck driver under Mafia influence allows carjackers to steal the truck).

==Incidents by country==

===South Africa===
Carjacking is a significant problem in South Africa, where it is called &quot;hijacking&quot;. South Africa is thought to have the highest carjacking rate in the world. There were 16,000 reported carjackings in 1998. The figures dropped to 12,434 reported carjackings in 2005, and continued to drop until 2011 to 2012, when the number of carjackings was 9,475, a record low. Subsequently, however, carjackings increased as part of an overall increase in violent organized crime, which the Institute for Security Studies attributed to poor police leadership. There were 11,221 reported carjackings in 2014. More than half of all carjackings in South Africa occurred in Gauteng province, which includes Johannesburg and Pretoria.

The carjacking issue in South Africa was depicted in the 2005 film &quot;Tsotsi&quot;, which won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, several new, unconventional anti-carjacking systems designed to harm the attacker were developed and marketed in South Africa, where carjacking had become endemic. Among these was the now defunct Blaster, a small flame-thrower that could be mounted to the underside of a vehicle.

===United States===
====Federal Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992====

In 1992, Congress, in the aftermath of a spate of violent carjackings (including some in which the victims were murdered), passed the Federal Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992 (FACTA), the first federal carjacking law, making it a federal crime (punishable by 15 years to life imprisonment) to use a firearm to steal &quot;through force or violence or intimidation&quot; a motor vehicle that had been shipped through interstate commerce. The 1992 Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 2119, took effect on October 25, 1992. However, only a small number of federal prosecutions were imposed for carjacking the year after the act was enacted, in part because many federal carjacking cases were turned over to state prosecutions because they do not meet U.S. Department of Justice criteria. The Federal Death Penalty Act, part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, an omnibus crime bill, made sixty new federal crimes punishable by the federal death penalty; among these were the killing of a victim in the commission of carjacking.

Throughout 1993, articles about carjackings appeared at the rate of more than one a week in newspapers throughout the country. The November 29, 1992, killing of two Osceola County, Florida, men by carjackers using a stolen 9 mm pistol resulted in the first federal prosecution of a fatal carjacking.

====Prevalence and statistical analysis====
According to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) conducted by the U.S. Department of Justice&#x27;s Bureau of Justice Statistics, from 1993 to 2002, some 38,000 carjackings occurred annually. According to the survey, over this time period men were more often victims than women, blacks more than whites, and Hispanics more than non-Hispanics. 56% of carjackers were identified by victims as black, 21% white, 16% Asian or Native American, and 7% mixed race or unknown. Some 93% of carjackings occurred in urban areas.

There were multiple carjackers in 56% of incidents, and the carjacker or carjackers were identified as male in 93% of incidents. A weapon was used in 74% of carjacking victimization: firearms in 45%, knives in 11%, and other weapons in 18%. Victims were injured in about 32% of completed carjackings and about 17% of attempted carjackings. Serious injuries, such as gunshot or knife wounds, broken bones, or internal injuries occurred in about 9% of incidents. About 14 murders a year involved car theft, but not all of these were carjackings. Some 68% of carjackings occurred at nighttime hours (6 p.m. to 6 a.m.). Some 98% of completed carjackings and 77% of attempted carjackings were reported to police. About 44% of carjacking incidents occurred in an open area (e.g., on the street or near public transportation) while 24% occurred in parking lots or garages or near commercial places (e.g., stores, gas stations, office buildings, restaurants/bars).

According to the NCVS, from 1992 and 1996, about 49,000 completed or attempted nonfatal carjackings took place each year in the United States. The carjacking was successful in about half of the incidents. Data on fatal carjackings are not available; &quot;about 27 homicides by strangers each year involved automobile theft,&quot; but not all of these were carjackings.

====In particular cities====
Carjackings were common in Newark, New Jersey, in the 1990s, and a wave of carjackings took place again in 2010. There were 288 carjackings in the city in 2010 (a 70% increase from the previous year), and Essex County (which includes Newark) had 69 in December 2010 alone. The Associated Press reported that &quot;unlike previous carjackings, in which thieves would strip vehicles for parts or sell them in other states, the recent wave perplexed law enforcement officials because almost all appeared to be done by thrill-seeking young men who would steal the cars for a few hours, drive them around and then abandon them.&quot; After federal, state, and law enforcement agencies formed a task force, 42 suspects were charged, and carjackings dropped dramatically. However, national media attention on carjackings in Essex County returned in December 2013, when a Hoboken lawyer was murdered at The Mall at Short Hills in Millburn, New Jersey, while defending his wife from four assailants, who were all later convicted of the crime.

For several years (but no longer), the major U.S. city with the highest rates of carjacking was Detroit. In 2008, Detroit had 1,231 carjackings, more than three a day. By 2013, that number had fallen to 701, but this was still the highest known number of carjackings for any major city in the country. The significant decrease in carjackings was credited to a coordinated effort by the Detroit Police Department, the FBI, and the local federal prosecutor&#x27;s office. Serial carjackers were targeted for federal prosecutions and longer sentences, and in 2009 the Detroit Police Department centralized all carjacking investigations and developed a suspect profiling system. Through mid-November 2014, Detroit had 486 carjackings, down 31% from the year before, but this was still three times more than the carjackings experienced by New York City (which has ten times Detroit&#x27;s population) in all of 2013. Even James Craig, chief of police of the Detroit Police Department, was the victim of an attempted carjacking while he was in his police cruiser.

A 2017 study used &quot;Risk Terrain Modeling&quot; analysis to identify spatial indicators of carjacking risk in Detroit. The analysis identified six factors that &quot;were influential in the best fitting model: proximity to service stations; convenience/grocery/liquor stores; bus stops; residential and commercial demolitions; and areas with high concentrations of drug arrests and restaurants.&quot; The study found that certain locations in Detroit &quot;had an expected rate of carjacking that was 278 times higher than other locations.&quot;

As of 2021, the American city with the highest number of carjackings is Chicago. Chicago began experiencing a surge in carjackings after 2019, and at least 1,415 such crimes took place in the city in 2020. According to the Chicago Police Department, carjackers are using face masks that are widely worn due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic to effectively blend in with the public and conceal their identity. 2021 saw a further increase to a 20-year high of over 1,800 carjackings. On January 27, 2021, Mayor Lori Lightfoot described the worsening wave of carjackings as being &#x27;top of mind,&#x27; and added 40 police officers to the CPD carjacking unit.

Many other cities have seen a similar increase in carjackings since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over 500 carjackings were recorded in New York City in 2021, compared to 328 in 2020 and 132 in 2019. Likewise, the police department of Philadelphia reported over 800 in 2021, compared to 170 in 2015. 281 carjackings occurred in New Orleans in 2021 while 105 occurred there in 2018, while Oakland reported 301 carjackings in 2020 and 521 carjackings in 2021.

====State law====
Some states have a specific carjacking statute. Other states do not have a specific carjacking law, and prosecute carjackers under the general robbery statute.

The law of some states, such as Louisiana, explicitly lists a killing in the course of defending oneself against forcible entry of an occupied motor vehicle as a justifiable homicide.

===United Kingdom===
Carjacking is an uncommon crime in Britain, making up about 1% of all vehicle thefts.

===Australia===
Australia does not specifically record the number of carjackings; such crimes are variously recorded as assault, robbery, motor vehicle theft, and some combination. However, a 2008 paper by the Australian Institute of Criminology, analyzing police and insurance records, suggested that fewer than 300 carjackings occur annually in Australia (about 0.5% of all theft incidents in the country). The paper noted that the low incidence of carjacking compared to the United States is attributable to the low rate of firearm-related crime in Australia and the fact that the &quot;broader socioeconomic picture of Australian society is one of relative good health in terms of wealth distribution and social cohesion&quot; providing little motivation for victimization that is &quot;both personal and violent.&quot; The paper notes that although carjacking was rare, isolated hot spots do arise occasionally, and that since the late 1990s, &quot;Sydney has experienced a number of carjacking clusters ... each lasting around three to six months and occurring in different locations including the eastern suburbs, the inner city and the south-west.&quot;

===Philippines===
The Philippine National Police keeps a record on the number of incidents of index crimes in the Philippines including carjacking. The act of &quot;carnapping&quot;, as it is known in the country, is penalized under the Anti-Carnapping Act of 2016.

<text>The Atlantic City–Brigantine Connector (officially the Atlantic City Expressway Connector; also known as the Atlantic City Connector or Brigantine Connector) is a connector freeway in Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States. It is a extension of the Atlantic City Expressway, connecting it to New Jersey Route 87, which leads into Brigantine via the Marina district of Atlantic City. Locally, the freeway is known as &quot;the Tunnel&quot;, due to the tunnel along its route that passes underneath the Westside neighborhood. The connector is a state highway owned and operated by the South Jersey Transportation Authority (SJTA); it has an unsigned designation of Route 446X.

Proposals for a similar connector road in Atlantic City date to 1964; planning began in 1995 after businessman Steve Wynn proposed a new casino in the Marina district. The goals were to reduce traffic on Atlantic City streets and improve access to the Marina district and Brigantine. It was supported by Governor Christine Todd Whitman and Mayor Jim Whelan, but faced major opposition during its planning. Residents whose homes were to be destroyed for the tunnel construction fought the project, and competing casino owner Donald Trump filed lawsuits to prevent its construction.

Construction took almost three years and opened in July 2001 at a total cost of $330 million. Since its opening, the connector has served up to 30,000 vehicles daily, and affected the city&#x27;s economy by bringing business to the casinos in the Marina district.

== Route description ==
The Atlantic City–Brigantine Connector is a freeway located entirely within Atlantic City, New Jersey, and has a route length of . It is a toll-free extension of the tolled Atlantic City Expressway (A.C. Expressway) and serves as a connector between the expressway and Route 87 near Brigantine. The connector averages two lanes per direction and has a posted speed limit of . The northernmost serves northbound traffic only, whereas southbound traffic travels along the parallel Route 87. Exits along the route are designated by letter from A to I. It is owned and operated by the SJTA and is classified by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) as a state highway, unsigned Route 446X, which is part of the National Highway System.

The route begins near the eastern terminus of the A.C. Expressway with a southbound-only exit to the Midtown and Downbeach districts. It then turns north along the western shore of Atlantic City and comes to a grade crossing with NJ Transit&#x27;s Atlantic City Line adjacent to the Atlantic City Rail Terminal, followed by an interchange at Bacharach Boulevard. At along the route, the freeway enters a tunnel under Horace Bryant Park in the Westside neighborhood. North of the tunnel is a southbound on-ramp from Route 87, followed by an interchange with U.S. Route 30 (US 30) via Route 187. After the US 30 interchange, the freeway continues for northbound traffic only, with an exit that serves as a U-turn to the southbound connector, an exit to Borgata and MGM Tower, and an exit to the Farley Marina and Golden Nugget Atlantic City. The final exit ramp leads to Harrah&#x27;s Atlantic City, after which the northbound connector terminates as it merges onto Route 87 northbound, which continues into Brigantine via the Brigantine Bridge.

== History ==
=== Initial proposals ===
The A.C. Expressway was built from 1962 to 1965, connecting the Philadelphia metropolitan area with the coastal resort city of Atlantic City. During construction in 1964, the Atlantic City Planning Board proposed the Route 30 Connector, a connector road linking the end of the expressway in Midtown Atlantic City with US 30. The purpose of the connector was to reduce traffic congestion and improve access to the Marina district and the neighboring city of Brigantine. Because of a lack of funds and environmental concerns about construction near the adjacent wetlands, the connector project remained dormant until 1990 when plans for the road were included in a report by the city&#x27;s Transportation Executive Council. A 1991 study found the project was environmentally feasible, and a route was proposed with a elevated highway over the wetlands. Construction costs were estimated at $80 million, but due to a continuing lack of funds and the complexity of constructing above the wetlands, the project was again postponed.

=== Planning ===
Plans for the connector reemerged in 1995 following a proposal from real estate businessman and Mirage Resorts president Steve Wynn. The city of Atlantic City issued requests for proposals to developers interested in developing the H-Tract, a former landfill site in the Marina district. Wynn obtained the property from the city following his proposal to construct Le Jardin, a $1 billion casino resort. He said he would only build if better road access was provided directly to the site, which prompted state officials to revive the connector plans.

Governor Christine Todd Whitman created a transportation task force in September 1995 to consider options. It studied 11 alternative routes, including elevated highways, tunnels, and improvements to existing streets. In March 1996, the task force determined that the best alternative was the Westside Bypass route, which included a highway along the western shore of the city with a tunnel under the Westside neighborhood. Whitman formally adopted the task force&#x27;s recommendation in July 1996, which ensured that the alternative would be built.

The goals of the project were to improve access to the Atlantic City Convention Center, the Marina district, and Brigantine, and to improve traffic flow along the city&#x27;s streets. It was expected to accommodate 14,000 to 17,000 vehicles per day. The tunnel was designed to have as little impact on the surrounding environment as possible; its design included both portals on opposite ends of the community, with landscaping added between the construction site and adjacent homes. Nine existing homes along Horace J. Bryant Jr. Drive would be demolished for the construction of the tunnel. Funding for the project, formally known as the Atlantic City–Brigantine Connector, was approved in January 1997. The total cost of the project was $330 million (equivalent to $ million in ). To fund the project, Mirage Resorts paid $110 million, with the remainder coming from state funds from the SJTA ($60 million), the Transportation Trust Fund ($95 million), and the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority ($65 million).

=== Controversies ===
The project was controversial, as tunnel construction would displace homes in the Westside neighborhood, and residents vowed to fight it. Its opponents described the project as an effort to destroy a community, while supporters claimed it was necessary to reduce traffic and create new jobs at the planned casino. Atlantic City Mayor Jim Whelan, a supporter, felt the project would benefit the city. Mirage offered each affected property owner on Horace J. Bryant Jr. Drive $200,000 for their homes, an offer five of the nine accepted. A group of 92 Westside homeowners filed a lawsuit against the company and the city claiming the tunnel construction would require the demolition of &quot;their stable, black neighborhood&quot; and create health concerns, thus violating their rights.

Donald Trump, the chairman of Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts at the time, was also opposed to the connector, and paid the Westside residents&#x27; legal bills. Knowing that Wynn&#x27;s casino would not be built without the connector, Trump also filed lawsuits against the use of state funds for the project. According to Whelan, Trump &quot;didn&#x27;t want the competition&quot; with his three existing Atlantic City casinos, including Trump Marina, next to the site of Wynn&#x27;s future casino at the H-Tract. Trump criticized the connector as a state-funded &quot;private driveway&quot; to Wynn&#x27;s casino, and denounced the funding as &quot;corporate welfare&quot; that unfairly favored an out-of-state company (Mirage) over those that had previously made business investments in the city. He claimed that the tunnel would have &quot;immense environmental impacts&quot;, and urged the state&#x27;s Department of Environmental Protection to deny construction permits. Mirage and Wynn retaliated by filing an antitrust lawsuit against Trump Hotels alleging that the company&#x27;s only goal was to prevent the Mirage resort from being built. The feud between Trump and Wynn over the connector was later the subject of the 2012 book &quot;The War at the Shore: Donald Trump, Steve Wynn, and the Epic Battle to Save Atlantic City&quot;, by former Mirage director Richard &quot;Skip&quot; Bronson.

According to the &quot;Las Vegas Sun&quot;, &quot;more than a dozen&quot; lawsuits were filed over the connector project. The lawsuit by the Westside homeowners was eventually dismissed by a federal judge in February 1998. Trump&#x27;s legal battles against the project lasted four years; he dropped them in February 2001 in exchange for a settlement that would include a new ramp to provide access from the future H-Tract casino to Trump Marina. Trump agreed to pay half the ramp&#x27;s $12 million cost. A group of New Jersey mayors who also opposed the project filed suit to block &quot;an inappropriate use of state funds&quot;. Their lawsuit was also dismissed; the court found the construction of the connector necessary whether the casino was built or not.

Aside from the tunnel, the project was criticized for including a railroad grade crossing on a freeway. The design was opposed by the Federal Railroad Administration and rail advocacy groups for safety concerns; however, the SJTA said the design was a compromise to allow for a full interchange at Bacharach Boulevard and provide access to the convention center.

=== Construction ===
Construction bids for the design–build contract of the Atlantic City–Brigantine Connector were submitted to the SJTA in July 1997. The contract was awarded to the joint venture of Yonkers Contracting Company and Granite Construction who served as the general contractors. At the time of inception, the connector was the largest design–build project performed by the State of New Jersey. Permits were granted in October 1998, and the groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 4. Completion was originally scheduled for May 2001.

Excavation of the tunnel began in May 1999; the cut and cover method was used. The nine homes were demolished and a trench was dug down to deep. A total of dirt were removed, most of which was reused to construct ramps at other sites on the connector. For the tunnel walls, of reinforced concrete were poured, and a concrete roof was constructed on top of the tunnel where the homes once stood; the site was later turned into a neighborhood park. Since the tunnel runs adjacent to the Penrose Canal, groundwater was present below the bottom of the trench, requiring a dewatering process to complete the construction. Technology was installed to monitor traffic flow and control the tunnel ventilation, which automatically triggers jet fans if carbon monoxide levels become too high. The tunnel is high, but is restricted to vehicles with a maximum clearance of .

In addition to the tunnel, the project included the construction of 16 overpasses, 15 ramps, and 23 retaining walls, plus landscaping, drainage, and the installation of variable-message signs. Workers also relocated public utility infrastructure, shifted of railroad tracks, rebuilt of bulkhead, and demolished a pumping station, a warehouse, and portions of a power station. A promenade at Trump Marina was leveled to make way for new ramps, and 37 ornamental lampposts were dismantled and later shipped to the nearby Tuckerton Seaport, which opened in 2000. To avoid disruptions in the neighborhood, construction materials were delivered by barge, and construction vehicles did not travel along any local streets.

During construction, Wynn sold Mirage Resorts to MGM Grand Inc. in 2000, forming the MGM Mirage company. Wynn&#x27;s plans for his Atlantic City casino resort were cancelled. MGM Mirage took over the H-Tract site and renamed it Renaissance Pointe, and developed plans for Borgata Hotel Casino &amp; Spa, which opened in 2003 after three years of construction.

=== Opening ===

A shortage of materials and delivery issues in late 2000 delayed the connector&#x27;s opening from May to July 2001. The grand opening ceremony took place on July 27, with festivities including a pedestrian tunnel walk. The connector was expected to open to traffic that evening, but due to last-minute malfunctions with the tunnel&#x27;s emergency communication system, it did not open to vehicles until July 31. Upon opening, the freeway was formally named the Atlantic City Expressway Connector, although it is called &quot;the Tunnel&quot; by locals. The ramp from Borgata to Trump Marina opened in 2003, which marked the completion of the connector project.

Once the connector opened, travel times between the Midtown and the Marina districts fell from fifteen minutes to four. Initial traffic volume was lower than expected; the connector served only 11,000 to 12,000 vehicles per day during its first several months, which was attributed to a decline in travel following the September 11 terrorist attacks. However, traffic increased the following year, and the connector served up to 20,000 vehicles daily by July 2002, significantly higher than the original projections. Due to the opening of Borgata in 2003, annual traffic volume increased by 25 percent that year, serving 30,000 vehicles daily. Whelan said &quot;the impact of the [connector] project is undeniable&quot; in improving traffic flow in the city and access to Brigantine. Traffic data from 2013 shows that the connector was used by 24,590 vehicles daily, including 1,229 trucks.

The connector also affected the city&#x27;s economy and casino industry. Whelan credited the project for bringing Borgata, which has since become the city&#x27;s top-grossing casino. Joe Kelly, executive director of the Greater Atlantic City Chamber of Commerce, said &quot;the Connector has been vitally important to furthering Atlantic City&#x27;s economic development objectives&quot; by improving access to the Marina district and making it more &quot;economically viable&quot;. State records from 2016 showed that the three casinos in the Marina district had an average annual gross revenue of $134 million, compared to $70 million for the casinos along the Atlantic City Boardwalk. Transportation analyst and former SJTA executive Anthony Marino cited the connector&#x27;s ease of access to the Marina district casinos as a factor in their success and a challenge for boardwalk casinos; Whelan said it forced boardwalk casinos to reevaluate their business models.

The tunnel was used as a filming location in 2018 for the TV series &quot;Succession&quot;; the series portrayed the location as the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel in New York City.

<text>The BRIT Awards (often simply called the BRITs) are the British Phonographic Industry&#x27;s annual popular music awards. The name was originally a shortened form of &quot;British&quot;, &quot;Britain&quot;, or &quot;Britannia&quot; (in the early days the awards were sponsored by Britannia Music Club), but subsequently became a backronym for British Record Industry Trusts Show. The awards were first held in 1977 and originated as an annual event in 1982 under the auspices of the British record industry&#x27;s trade association, the BPI. In 1989, they were renamed The BRIT Awards. Mastercard has been the long-term sponsor of the event. In addition, an equivalent awards ceremony for classical music, called the Classic BRIT Awards, was held annually between 2000 and 2013, before being revived in 2018 but has not been held since.

The highest profile music awards ceremony in the UK, the BRIT Awards have featured some of the most notable events in British popular culture, such as the final public appearance of Freddie Mercury, the Jarvis Cocker protest against Michael Jackson, the height of a high-profile feud between Oasis and fellow Britpop band Blur, the Union Jack dress worn by Geri Halliwell of the Spice Girls, and a Chumbawamba member throwing a bucket of iced water over then-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott. These moments took place in the 1990s when the ceremony had a reputation for being &quot;a little shambolic, unpredictable and, at times, anarchic&quot; with a criticism it has lost its edge since then and &quot;evolved into a more polished, sanitised affair&quot;.

The BRIT Awards were broadcast live until 1989, when Samantha Fox and Mick Fleetwood hosted a widely criticised show in which little went as rehearsed. From 1990 to 2006, the event was recorded and broadcast the following night. From 2007, The BRIT Awards reverted to a live broadcast on British television, on 14 February on ITV. That year, comedian Russell Brand was the host and three awards were dropped from the ceremony: British Rock Act, British Urban Act and British Pop Act. For the last time, on 16 February 2010, Earls Court in London was the venue for The BRITs. The BRIT Awards were held at the O2 Arena in London for the first time in 2011.
The BRIT Award statuette given to the winners features Britannia, the female personification of Britain. Since 2011, the statuette has been regularly redesigned by well known British artists, architects, and designers including Vivienne Westwood, Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin, Peter Blake, Zaha Hadid, Anish Kapoor, David Adjaye, Yinka Ilori and Es Devlin, Pam Hogg, Olaolu Slawn and Rachel Jones.

Robbie Williams holds the record for the most BRIT Awards, 13 as a solo artist and another five as part of Take That. Girl group Little Mix made history at the Brit Awards 2021, when they became the first female group to receive the award at the ceremony after 43 years since it was first introduced. In 2024, English singer-songwriter Raye, broke the record for the most nominations received by a single artist in a year with seven in total.

==Ceremonies==

The first awards ceremony was in 1977, as &quot;The BRITish Record Industry BRITannia Awards&quot;, to mark the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee and was televised by Thames Television. There has been an annual ceremony since 1982.

===Broadcast===
The 1988 BPI Awards was the first of the ceremonies to be broadcast on live television. The BBC had previously broadcast the ceremony from 1985, with the shows from 1982 to 1984 not broadcast on television. The BBC continued to broadcast the renamed BRIT Awards, live in 1989 and pre-recorded from 1990 to 1992. ITV have broadcast the awards since 1993, pre-recorded until 2006 and live from 2007 onwards. BBC Radio 1 has provided backstage radio coverage since 2008.

====Launch show====
For many years, ITV have aired a launch show in January titled &quot;The BRITs Are Coming&quot;, which reveals some of the artists who have been nominated at the upcoming ceremony. Previous hosts include Jonathan Ross and Kate Thornton in 2001.

The show returned after a long hiatus in 2013 and was hosted by Nick Grimshaw at the Savoy Hotel in London, who returned as host in 2014, followed by Reggie Yates and Laura Whitmore in 2015 and 2016 respectively. Emma Willis hosted &quot;The BRITs Are Coming&quot; in 2017 and again in 2018 when it was broadcast live for the first time. Clara Amfo hosted the 2019 launch show and Alice Levine hosted in 2020. Grimshaw hosted the March 2021 edition of &quot;The Brits Are Coming&quot; with singer Griff. The December 2021 launch show was hosted by Amfo and Maya Jama.

The 2023 edition took place on 11 February 2023 and was held, for the first time, on a weekend. The nominees for 2023 were announced via the BRITs social platforms on 12 January 2023 by Jack Saunders and Vick Hope. The nominees were also revealed by Tom Daley, Yung Filly, Jill Scott, and brothers Joe and George Baggs from &quot;Gogglebox&quot; across their own social media channels. The launch show returned in January 2024 and was renamed &quot;Bring on The BRITs&quot;; it was hosted by Yinka Bokinni and live streamed, as part of a new partnership between The BRITs and Meta, via the BRITs account on social platforms Instagram and Facebook. The same format was used in 2025, with that year&#x27;s launch show hosted by Siân Welby.

;Notes
==Notable moments==

===Electricians&#x27; strike (1987)===
In 1987 the BPI Awards ceremony was held in the Great Room at the Grosvenor House Hotel. At the time there was a BBC electricians&#x27; strike in effect, and the organisers decided to use a non-TV events production company, called Upfront, to manage the show. Despite the show being picketed, the event was transmitted as intended. For a while, the outdoor broadcast scanner was rocked on its wheels by the protesters and they managed to shut off the power to one of the big GE video screen projectors. Upfront was then asked to organise the following year and persuaded the BPI to move the event to a larger venue, starting the trend that continues to this day, albeit at The O2, and with a different production company (MJK Productions).

===Samantha Fox and Mick Fleetwood (1989)===
In 1989, the ceremony was broadcast live and presented by Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s Mick Fleetwood and singer Samantha Fox. The inexperience of the hosts, an ineffective autocue, and little preparation combined to create an unprofessional show that was poorly received. The hosts continually got their lines mixed up, a pre-recorded message from Michael Jackson was never transmitted and several guest stars arrived late on stage or at the wrong time, such as Boy George in place of The Four Tops.

===Andy Bell and Boy George embrace (1989)===

In accepting the award for British Group from Boy George at the 1989 awards, Andy Bell of Erasure kissed George on stage to cheers from the crowd, with Bell stating it was an act in protest against Section 28 introduced by Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s Conservative government that prohibited the &quot;promotion&quot; of homosexuality in schools.

===Freddie Mercury&#x27;s final public appearance (1990)===
The 1990 awards ceremony saw the last public appearance of Queen frontman Freddie Mercury. Queen appeared at the ceremony to receive the Outstanding Contribution to Music. Mercury (who had been suffering from AIDS since 1987 but had not disclosed it to the public) did not make a speech, as Brian May did the talking on behalf of the other members, but his gaunt appearance was noticeable.

===The KLF (1992)===
In 1992, dance/art band The KLF was awarded Best British Group (shared with Simply Red) and were booked to open the show. In an attempt to hijack the event, the duo collaborated with grindcore metal band Extreme Noise Terror to perform a death metal version of the dance song &quot;3 a.m. Eternal&quot;, complete with flame-throwers, and ending with Bill Drummond firing blanks from a vintage machine gun over the audience. KLF publicist/announcer Scott Piering stated &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, The KLF have now left the music business&quot;. The performance prompted conductor Sir Georg Solti to walk out in disgust. Producers of the show then refused to let a motorcycle courier collect the award on behalf of the band. Later that evening, the KLF dumped a dead sheep outside the venue of an after-show party, and later buried their BRIT Award statuette at Stonehenge signifying their abhorrence of the music industry.

===Michael Jackson and Jarvis Cocker (1996)===
In 1996, Michael Jackson was given a special Artist of a Generation award. At the ceremony he accompanied his single &quot;Earth Song&quot; with a stage show, culminating with Jackson as a &#x27;Christ-like figure&#x27; surrounded by children. Jarvis Cocker, of the band Pulp, mounted the stage in what he would later claim as a protest at this portion of the performance. Cocker ran across the stage, lifting his shirt and pointing his (clothed) backside in Jackson&#x27;s direction. Cocker was subsequently questioned by the police but was told he would not be prosecuted.

Regarding his actions, Cocker said, &quot;My actions were a form of protest at the way Michael Jackson sees himself as some kind of Christ-like figure with the power of healing. I just ran on the stage. I didn&#x27;t make any contact with anyone as far as I recall.&quot;

===Oasis and Blur rivalry (1996)===
1996 saw the height of a feud between Britpop bands Oasis and Blur. The differing styles of the bands, coupled with their prominence within the Britpop movement, led the British media to seize upon the rivalry between the bands. Both factions played along, with the Gallaghers taunting Blur at the 1996 BRIT Awards by singing a rendition of &quot;Parklife&quot; when they collected their award for Best British Group (with Liam Gallagher changing the lyrics to &quot;Shite-life&quot; and Noel Gallagher changing them to &quot;Marmite&quot;).

===Chumbawamba and John Prescott (1998)===
In 1998, Danbert Nobacon of the band Chumbawamba emptied a bucket of iced water over then-Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott. Despite apologies on behalf of the band from EMI Europe, Chumbawamba were unrepentant, saying, &quot;If John Prescott has the nerve to turn up at events like the Brit Awards in a vain attempt to make Labour seem cool and trendy, then he deserves all we can throw at him.&quot;

===Russell Brand (2007)===
The host of the 2007 awards ceremony, comedian Russell Brand made several quips relating to news stories of the time including Robbie Williams entering rehab for addiction to prescription drugs, the Queen&#x27;s &#x27;naughty bits&#x27; and a fatal friendly fire incident involving a British soldier killed by American armed forces in Iraq. ITV received over 300 complaint calls from viewers. He would again instigate controversy the following year at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards.

===Adele speech cut short (2012)===
Adele won the British Album of the Year widely regarded as the most coveted award. Less than half a minute into her acceptance speech, host James Corden was forced to cut Adele off in order to introduce Blur who were due to perform an eleven-minute set as they had received the Outstanding Contribution to Music and the ceremony was running over its allotted time. Adele was visibly annoyed and proceeded to raise her middle finger and the producers of the show came under fire on Twitter for the decision. Following the incident Adele said &quot;I got cut off during my speech for Best Album and I flung the middle finger. But that finger was to the suits at The BRIT Awards, not to my fans&quot;. Adele received an apology from the show&#x27;s organisers, who stated; &quot;We send our deepest apologies to Adele that her big moment was cut short. We don&#x27;t want this to undermine her incredible achievement in winning our night&#x27;s biggest award. It tops off what&#x27;s been an incredible year for her.&quot; Due to the tight schedule, only three of the five songs Blur played were broadcast on ITV.

===Alex Turner speech (2014)===
On 2014 Arctic Monkeys won the British Album of the Year. When the band got up on stage to receive the award, lead singer Alex Turner, started his speech by testing the mic and then talked about the cyclical nature of rock music, saying that even if its popularity declines it will never die as a music genre, while the rest of the band laughed in the background. He ended the speech by saying, &quot;Invoice me for the microphone if you need to&quot;, dropped it to the ground, and left the stage. That night they became the first act to win both British Album and British Group three times. The speech divided both press and audience, being labeled as both &quot;pretentious twaddle&quot; and a sincere defence of the genre, as well as garnering reactions from other musicians, with Johnny Marr saying it was &quot;quite poetic&quot;.

When asked a few days later, Turner said, &quot;In public, I&#x27;m a quiet guy, so doing anything in front of lots of people always makes me nervous. I&#x27;m known for my music, not how well I deliver a speech. People always assume if you&#x27;re in a band that&#x27;s been on the scene for ages that you&#x27;re going to be really confident, but that&#x27;s not true at all.&quot; In a 2016 interview with Rolling Stone, he re-addressed the speech, &quot;A lot of people thought I was waffling away on drugs, but I wasn&#x27;t. I just can&#x27;t pretend getting an award was something I&#x27;ve dreamed about since I was a kid, because it isn&#x27;t.&quot; In 2022 when an interviewer implied the speech was akin to performance art, Turner seemed to agree. Wet Leg&#x27;s singer Rhian Teasdale quoted part of Turner&#x27;s speech, during the 2023 ceremony, as the band won New Artist.

===David Bowie enters Scottish independence debate (2014)===
At 67 years of age, musician David Bowie became the oldest recipient of now defunct British Male Solo Artist. Bowie used his acceptance speech, delivered in his absence by Kate Moss, to urge Scotland to remain part of the UK in the September 2014 Scottish independence referendum. His speech read: &quot;I&#x27;m completely delighted to have a Brit for being the best male – but I am, aren&#x27;t I Kate? Yes. I think it&#x27;s a great way to end the day. Thank you very, very much and Scotland stay with us.&quot; Bowie&#x27;s unusual intervention in British politics garnered a significant reaction throughout the UK on social media.

=== Little Mix Best British Group win and speech (2021) ===

In 2021, Little Mix&#x27;s win for British Group marked the first time that a girl group had won that award since it was first introduced in 1977. The group used their acceptance speech to call out white male dominance, misogyny, sexism and lack of diversity in the industry. Fellow group member Leigh-Anne Pinnock stated &quot;It&#x27;s not easy being a female in the UK pop industry. We&#x27;ve all seen the white male dominance, misogyny, sexism, and lack of diversity. We&#x27;re proud of how we&#x27;ve stuck together, stood for our group, surrounded ourselves with strong women, and are now using our voices more than ever.&quot;

Little Mix also called out the awards ceremony for the lack of nominations and wins for female groups in the category while paying homage to previous &quot;female bands&quot; including the Spice Girls, Sugababes, All Saints, and Girls Aloud etc, who all had made significant contributions to pop culture in the UK but were overlooked by the Brit Awards.

=== Raye sets a new record (2024) ===
At the Brit Awards 2024, English singer-songwriter Raye received seven nominations, making her the most nominated artist in a single year breaking a record held by Gorillaz, Craig David and Robbie Williams. Furthermore, she broke the record for the most wins received in a single night with six in total.

==Notable performances==

===Spice Girls&#x27; performance of &quot;Wannabe&quot; and &quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot; (1997)===
Ginger Spice, Geri Halliwell, wore a Union Jack dress. Spicemania was at its height in the UK and the Spice Girls had just cracked the US as well, reaching Number 1 with their debut single and album.
Halliwell was originally going to wear an all-black dress, but she thought it was too boring so her sister sewed on a Union Jack tea towel, with a &#x27;peace&#x27; sign on the back. The now iconic red, white and blue mini-dress was worn during the Spice Girls&#x27; performance of their Number 1 song &quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot;. In 1998 she sold her dress in a charity auction to Hard Rock Cafe in Las Vegas for a record £41,320, giving Halliwell the Guinness World Record for the most expensive piece of pop star clothing ever sold. This performance won the Spice Girls the award for &quot;BRITs Hits 30 – Best Live Performance at The BRIT Awards&quot; at the 2010 BRIT Awards, with Samantha Fox presenting the award to Geri Halliwell and Mel B.

===Geri Halliwell&#x27;s performance of &quot;Bag It Up&quot; (2000)===
Three years following the iconic Spice Girls performance, Halliwell, now a solo artist, performed her new single &quot;Bag It Up&quot; at the 2000 BRIT Awards. The performance featured Halliwell emerging, whilst dancing on with a pole, from a pair of large inflatable female legs. As the performance continued, her male backing dancers stripped to their pink briefs whilst dancing with the Union Jack flag. It is widely believed that Halliwell lip-synced her performance. In addition to all this, the performance is famous for being performed on the same night that the Spice Girls received the award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, which Halliwell declined to accept with her former bandmates.

===Gorillaz&#x27;s performance of &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; (2002)===
When it was announced that past Brit Award recipient Damon Albarn, and his project Gorillaz, would be taking the stage at the 2002 Brit Awards, no one knew what to expect. The four cartoon members of the band performed the song on giant life size screens (an early version of a 3D hologram) without the Blur frontman being present at all. The band performed their hit single &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; alongside UK underground rap group Phi Life Cypher and a group of silhouetted female dancers mimicking the zombies from the band&#x27;s music video. The performance received rapturous cheers and applause.

===Girls Aloud&#x27;s performance of &quot;The Promise&quot; (2009)===
English-Irish girl group Girls Aloud marked their first ever performance at the 2009 ceremony, by performing their single &quot;The Promise&quot;. The performance saw the members, Cheryl Cole, Kimberley Walsh, Sarah Harding, Nicola Roberts and Nadine Coyle appear as though they were naked, with their modesty being covered by pink feather fans. This performance was nominated in the 2010 ceremony for the &quot;BRITs Hits 30 – Best Live Performance at The BRIT Awards&quot;, alongside Oasis and The Who, which the Spice Girls eventually went on to win.

===Adele&#x27;s performance of &quot;Someone like You&quot; (2011)===
Adele performed her song &quot;Someone like You&quot; at the 2011 BRITs with only a piano accompanying her. Her emotional performance was received with a standing ovation at the O2 Arena and the video has received 187 million views so far on YouTube. The performance launched &quot;Someone Like You&quot; 46 spots up the UK charts to Number 1, and in the process, made Adele the first artist in the UK since The Beatles to have two top five singles and two top five albums at the same time. The performance had all lights down and focused on Adele and her piano.

===Madonna&#x27;s performance of &quot;Living for Love&quot; (2015)===
Madonna&#x27;s live return to BRIT Awards after 20 years was widely promoted in the media in the days leading up to the ceremony and during the show itself. During the performance of &quot;Living for Love&quot;, she walked onstage wearing an oversized cape. When standing on stairs situated on the stage, the cape&#x27;s cord failed to separate, so when Madonna&#x27;s backing dancer pulled the cape behind her, she fell down the stairs and noticeably hit the stage hard. She paused momentarily as her backing music continued, before she managed to separate herself from the cape and then continued performing. In an interview on &quot;The Jonathan Ross Show&quot;, Madonna blamed her fall on a wardrobe malfunction as her cape had been tied too tightly so it could not be unfastened in time, before adding: &quot;I had a little bit of whiplash, I smacked the back of my head. And I had a man standing over me with a flashlight until about 3am to make sure I was compos mentis. I know how to fall, I have fallen off my horse many times.&quot;

===Katy Perry and Skip Marley&#x27;s performance of &quot;Chained to the Rhythm&quot; (2017)===

In the leadup to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Katy Perry was a major endorsement for Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, performing at many of her rallies and speaking at public events. After Donald Trump won the election, Perry returned to recording her fifth studio album and in February 2017 released &quot;Chained to the Rhythm&quot;. During the performance, she was joined onstage by two large skeletal puppets dressed as Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May. The performance was also notable as a backing dancer fell offstage at the end of the performance whilst wearing a house costume.

<text>Park Avenue is a boulevard in New York City that carries north and southbound traffic in the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx. For most of the road&#x27;s length in Manhattan, it runs parallel to Madison Avenue to the west and Lexington Avenue to the east. Park Avenue&#x27;s entire length was formerly called Fourth Avenue; the title still applies to the section between Cooper Square and 14th Street. The avenue is called Union Square East between 14th and 17th streets, and Park Avenue South between 17th and 32nd streets.

== History ==
=== Early years and railroad construction ===
Because of its designation as the widest avenue on Manhattan&#x27;s East Side, Park Avenue originally carried the tracks of the New York and Harlem Railroad built in the 1830s, just a few years after the adoption of the Manhattan street grid. The railroad&#x27;s right-of-way at ground level forced foot and carriage traffic onto either side of the tracks. Later on, the railroad was run through an open cut tunnel under Murray Hill, which was then covered with grates and grass between 34th and 40th Street in the early 1850s. A section of this &quot;park&quot; was later renamed Park Avenue in 1860. Park Avenue&#x27;s original southern terminus was at 34th Street, and the newly renamed Park Avenue was given its own house-numbering system separate from that of Fourth Avenue. The address 1 Park Avenue was assigned to a house at 101 East 34th Street, at the northeast corner of Park Avenue and 34th Street.

The Harlem Railroad was later incorporated into the New York Central Railroad, and a terminal for the New York Central at 42nd Street, the Grand Central Depot, opened in 1871. But the tracks laid to the new terminal proved problematic. There were originally no grade-separated crossings of the railroads between 42nd and 59th Streets. As such, they required railroad crossings along Fourth Avenue, which resulted in frequent accidents; seven people died within 12 days of the Hudson River Railroad&#x27;s move to Grand Central.

In 1872, shortly after the opening of Grand Central Depot, New York Central owner Cornelius Vanderbilt proposed the Fourth Avenue Improvement Project. The tracks between 48th and 56th Streets were to be moved into a shallow open cut, while the segment between 56th and 97th Streets, which was in a rock cut, would be covered over. After the improvements were completed in 1874, the railroads, approaching Grand Central Depot from the north, descended into the Park Avenue Tunnel at 96th Street and continued underground into the new depot. As part of the project, Fourth Avenue was transformed into a boulevard with a median strip that covered the railroad&#x27;s ventilation grates. Eight footbridges crossed the tracks between 45th and 56th Streets, and there were also vehicular overpasses at 45th and 48th Streets. The boulevard north of Grand Central was renamed Park Avenue in 1888.

=== Grand Central and Terminal City ===

A fatal collision between two trains occurred under Park Avenue in 1902, in part because the smoke coming from the steam trains obscured the signals. The New York state legislature subsequently passed a law to ban all steam trains in Manhattan. By December 1902, as part of an agreement with the city, New York Central agreed to put the approach to Grand Central Station from 46th to 59th Streets in an open cut under Park Avenue, and to upgrade the tracks to accommodate electric trains. Overpasses would be built across the open cut at most of the cross-streets. The new electric-train terminal, Grand Central Terminal, was opened in 1913.

After the electric trains were buried underground, the area around Park Avenue in the vicinity of Grand Central was developed into several blocks worth of prime real estate called Terminal City. Stretching from 42nd to 51st Streets between Madison and Lexington Avenues, it came to include the Chrysler Building and other prestigious office buildings; luxury apartment houses along Park Avenue; and an array of high-end hotels that included the Marguery, Park Lane, and Waldorf Astoria. In 1929, New York Central built its headquarters in a 34-story building (now called the Helmsley Building), straddling Park Avenue north of the terminal.

The Park Avenue Viaduct reroutes Park Avenue around Grand Central Terminal between 40th and 46th Streets, allowing Park Avenue traffic to traverse around the building and over 42nd Street without encumbering nearby streets. The western (now southbound) leg of the viaduct was completed in 1919, but congestion developed soon after the viaduct&#x27;s opening, so an eastern leg for northbound traffic was added in 1928.

=== 20th century ===
The developer Henry Mandel acquired the lots on the eastern side of Fourth Avenue between 32nd and 33rd Street in 1923 under the name &quot;One Park Avenue Corporation&quot;. To ensure his corporate name was accurate, Mandel asked the New York City Board of Aldermen to move Park Avenue&#x27;s southern terminus to 32nd Street. The change went into effect on December 1, 1924, and address numbers along Park Avenue were changed accordingly. The previous house numbered 1 Park Avenue was occupied by Martha Bacon, widow of diplomat Robert Bacon, who led the opposition to the renumbering. The Board of Aldermen summarily overturned the name change, but Mayor John Hylan vetoed the move in April 1925. This prompted Bacon to appeal the decision to the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, which overturned Hylan&#x27;s veto in November 1927, on the basis that the extension of Park Avenue to 32nd Street had been made for the benefit of a developer. Mandel&#x27;s development at 32nd Street was thus known as 461–477 Fourth Avenue, and the developers of that building sued to reverse the appellate ruling. The New York Court of Appeals, the state&#x27;s highest court, reversed the appellate ruling in February 1928. Bacon contemplated bringing up the matter with the United States Supreme Court, but she ultimately relented, changing her address to &quot;Park Avenue at 34th&quot; by 1930.

In 1927, the medians on Park Avenue north of Grand Central were trimmed to add one lane of traffic in each direction. This project eliminated the pedestrian path on the medians, as they became much narrower. The median was extended by one block from 96th Street to 97th Street in 1941, creating the only remaining median on Park Avenue with a pedestrian path and seating. In the 1920s the portion of Park Avenue from Grand Central to 96th Street saw extensive apartment building construction. This long stretch of the avenue contains some of the most expensive real estate in the world. Real estate at 740 Park Avenue, for example, sells for several thousand dollars per square foot.

In October 1937, a part of the Murray Hill Tunnel was reopened for road traffic. Efforts to promote a Grand Park Avenue Expressway to Grand Concourse in the Bronx were unsuccessful.

A tradition was introduced in 1945 as a memorial to American soldiers killed in action, whereby Christmas trees are placed in the median and lit up on the first Sunday in December at Brick Presbyterian Church. On May 5, 1959, the New York City Council voted 20–1 to change the name of Fourth Avenue between 17th and 32nd Streets to Park Avenue South. The renaming, along with a ban on overhanging signs along the newly renamed Park Avenue South, was intended to improve the character of the avenue. Unlike with the earlier renamings of Park Avenue, the address numbers of Park Avenue South continued from those on the remaining section of Fourth Avenue. The Pan Am Building (now MetLife Building), in between the Park Avenue Viaduct&#x27;s legs north of Grand Central Terminal, was opened in 1963.

=== 21st century ===
In September 2007, the Metro-North Railroad reached an agreement with the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) to install pedestrian traffic signals along Park Avenue between 46th Street and 56th Street. The two sides had feuded over the issue since 1982, when Penn Central controlled the Park Avenue Tunnel. In 1997, the NYCDOT commissioner stated that signals would be installed during an upcoming phase of reconstruction in the Grand Central area. The $35 million project, whose cost was split between Metro-North and the city, was approved by the MTA Board later that month. It called for the installation of 12 pedestrian signals and 8 traffic signals at the eleven intersections and the renovation of the sidewalks and streets around Grand Central to prevent rainwater from seeping into the tunnel. Car traffic in this area had been controlled by traffic lights on a pole at each intersection in the middle of the median, instead of the usual four from each direction, resulting in a relatively high rate of pedestrian injuries. Additional traffic lights and pedestrian signals had not been added because this area of Park Avenue was located directly atop the roof of the Park Avenue Tunnel, with the street being above the roof in some locations. Because the roof was thick, there was not enough room to provide a foundation for the traffic poles without puncturing the structure. Due to the high cost of making these upgrades, and the lack of cooperation between the New York City Department of Transportation and Metro-North, which had opposed any solution that would modify the tunnel roof, the project was delayed for several years. The project had been estimated to cost $200,000 per intersection in 1994. As part of the new agreement, Metro-North designed a way to anchor the traffic signals in the deck and tunnel roof. Pedestrian signals and gantry-mounted traffic signals were installed at these intersections in July 2010.

On March 12, 2014, two apartment buildings near 116th Street, 1644 and 1646 Park Avenue, were destroyed in a gas explosion. Eight people were killed and many others were injured.

In 2019, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority provided funding for repairs to the roof of the Grand Central Terminal train shed. The train shed is located under Park Avenue and surrounding streets from 43rd to 57th Street, and the repairs to the train shed&#x27;s roof involved reconstructing parts of Park Avenue. In August 2024, the city government began soliciting bids for the reconstruction of Park Avenue&#x27;s median between 46th and 57th Streets. The project was to include additional plantings, benches, and concessions.

== Route ==
=== Manhattan ===

The road that becomes Park Avenue originates at the Bowery. From Cooper Square at 8th Street to Union Square at 14th Street, it is known as Fourth Avenue, a road carrying northbound traffic. At 14th Street, it turns slightly northeast to align with other avenues as drawn in the Commissioners&#x27; Plan of 1811. From 14th Street to 17th Street, it forms the eastern boundary of Union Square and is known as Union Square East; its southbound lanes merge with Broadway south of 15th Street, and the thoroughfare divides into two distinct portions in the one-block section between 14th and 15th Streets. From 17th Street to 32nd Street, it is known as Park Avenue South. Address numbers on Park Avenue South are a continuation of those on Fourth Avenue; for example, 225 Park Avenue South was originally known as 225 Fourth Avenue.

Above 32nd Street, for the remainder of its distance, it is known as Park Avenue, a boulevard. The address numbers for Park Avenue are reset above 32nd Street; for example, the address 1 Park Avenue would ordinarily have been numbered 461 Fourth Avenue. Between 33rd Street and 40th Street, the leftmost northbound lane descends into the Murray Hill Tunnel. North of 40th Street, the center lanes of Park Avenue rise onto an elevated structure that goes around Grand Central Terminal and the MetLife Building (formerly the Pan Am Building), carrying each direction of traffic on opposite sides of the buildings. The bridge, one of two structures in Manhattan known as the Park Avenue Viaduct, returns to ground level at 46th Street after going through the Helmsley Building (also referred to as the New York Central Building or 230 Park Avenue). The IRT Lexington Avenue Line runs under this portion of the street. Once the line reaches Grand Central–42nd Street, it shifts east to Lexington Avenue.
As Park Avenue enters Midtown north of Grand Central Terminal, it is distinguished by many glass-box skyscrapers that serve as headquarters for corporations and investment banks such as Société Générale, JPMorgan Chase at 270 Park Avenue and 277 Park Avenue, UBS at 299 Park Avenue, Citigroup at 399 Park Avenue, Colgate-Palmolive, and MetLife at the MetLife Building. From 47th to 97th Streets, the tracks for Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Park Avenue main line run in the Park Avenue Tunnel underneath Park Avenue. At 97th Street, the tracks come above ground, rising onto the other Manhattan structure known as the Park Avenue Viaduct. The first street to pass under the viaduct is 102nd Street; from there to the Harlem River the railroad viaduct runs down the middle of Park Avenue. Park Avenue in Manhattan ends north of 132nd Street, with connections to the Harlem River Drive.

The flowers and greenery in the median of Manhattan&#x27;s Park Avenue are privately maintained, by the Fund for Park Avenue. The begonia was specifically chosen by the Fund&#x27;s gardeners because there is no automatic watering system and the floral variety is resilient under hot sun rays.

=== The Bronx ===
The avenue is continued on the other side of the river in the Bronx. In the Bronx, Park Avenue begins at East 135th Street in the Mott Haven neighborhood. The entire avenue is divided by Metro-North&#x27;s own right of way in the borough. Between East 135th Street to East 173rd Street, Park Avenue is one way only in either direction in most sections. North of East 173rd Street it is a two way avenue continuing to Fordham Plaza where it ends.

<doc id="362670" wikidata="Q827248" url="?curid=362670" title="New Jersey Route 172">
<text>Route 172 is a short state highway in New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States. The designation runs along the southernmost leg of George Street, which is county and city-maintained the rest of the way. Route 172 is long, serving as a connector from an intersection with County Route 527 (CR 527) and Paul Robeson Boulevard to an interchange with Route 18. The highway was assigned in the 1950s, when nearby Route 18 was realigned onto a new freeway over Burnet Street in New Brunswick. Route 172 underwent a major upgrade during the reconstruction of Route 18, including a roundabout at an intersection with CR 617, and a brand-new interchange with the local lanes of Route 18.

== Route description ==

Route 172 begins at the intersection of Paul Robeson Boulevard (formerly Commercial Avenue prior to 2019) and George Street (CR 527, signed as CR 672) in New Brunswick. Route 172 (with CR 527 unsigned at this point) travels as a two-lane road southeast along George Street first passing residences before intersecting Bishop Street and Jones Avenue where both sides of the road become flanked by the Douglass Campus of Rutgers University. It intersects Nichol Avenue and Chapel Drive which both serve the campus. The road crosses a small stream and passes under a pedestrian overpass before reaching a roundabout marking the northern terminus of CR 617 (Ryders Lane). Route 172 turns to the north and becomes a four-lane small divided highway. A pair of jughandles serve Gibbons Drive with a signalized intersection in the center. Past this intersection, a ramp providing access for eastbound Route 172 traffic to Route 18 south exits the state highway. Route 172 crosses over the southbound lanes and the northbound express lanes of Route 18 before the state highway terminates at a signalized intersection with the northbound local lanes of Route 18.
== History ==
Route 172 originated as alignment of State Highway Route S-28, which was assigned in the 1927 state highway renumbering. In the 1953 renumbering, State Highway Route S-28 was reassigned as Route 18. However, just a few years after the designation of Route 18 in New Brunswick along George Street, construction of a bypass around New Brunswick began. The highway was constructed along Burnet Street, which became state-maintained by the State Highway Department. The route was completed to Route 27, and Route 18 was moved onto that alignment. The former alignment of Route 18 remained state-maintained up to the intersection with Commercial Avenue, which was eventually re-designated as Route 172.

When the New Jersey Department of Transportation started construction on upgrading the bypass, the fly-over ramp and on-ramp to and from Route 172 were torn down for construction of a new interchange along a new local/express format. The overpass was closed on October 12, 2007 to begin the construction. The bridge was built by 1955 and was replaced in 2008. On January 2, 2009, the new exit ramp for Route 18 to Route 172 was reopened to traffic.

<doc id="362674" wikidata="Q4971324" url="?curid=362674" title="British degree abbreviations">
<text>Degree abbreviations are used as an alternative way to specify an academic degree instead of spelling out the title in full, such as in reference books such as &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; and on business cards. Many degree titles have more than one possible abbreviation, with the abbreviation used varying between different universities. In the UK it is normal not to punctuate abbreviations for degrees with full stops (e.g. &quot;BSc&quot; rather than &quot;B.Sc.&quot;), although this is done at some universities.

== Overview ==

The &quot;Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies&quot; lays down five levels of qualification with the title of degree: foundation (not in Scotland), ordinary and honours bachelor&#x27;s (only separate levels in Scotland), master&#x27;s and doctoral. These relate to specific outcome-based level descriptors and are tied to the Bologna Process.

It is common to put the name of the awarding institute in brackets after the degree abbreviation, e.g. BA (Lond). A list of standard abbreviations for British universities can be found at .

Note that the lists below include historical degrees that may not currently be offered in British universities.

=== Anomalies ===

For historical reasons some universities (the ancient universities of England and Scotland) do not fully adhere to the Framework (particularly with respect to the title of Master of Arts), and degrees in medicine, dentistry, and veterinary medicine are titled as bachelor&#x27;s degrees despite being at master&#x27;s level.

==== Undergraduate Master of Arts degrees ====

The usage in the ancient universities is not consistent with the Framework or the Bologna Process. The ancient universities of England (Oxford and Cambridge) grant an MA degree that is not a substantive qualification but reflects the ancient practice of these universities of promoting BAs to MAs (and thus full membership of the University) a few years after graduating (see Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)). The ancient universities of Scotland award an undergraduate MA (see Scottish MA) instead of a BA. For students to obtain a master&#x27;s degree consistent with the framework in these ancient English universities, they have created the MSt (Master of Studies) to address this anomaly and differentiate between the degrees, both master&#x27;s.

The MAs from Aberdeen, Heriot-Watt, Glasgow, Edinburgh and St Andrews are considered bachelor&#x27;s level qualifications on the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications and first cycle qualifications under the Bologna Process, while the Oxbridge MAs are considered &quot;not academic qualifications&quot; (the actual qualification being the BA).

==== Master&#x27;s level bachelor&#x27;s degrees ====

Conversely, some bachelor&#x27;s degrees in the &quot;higher faculties&quot; at the older universities in the UK (e.g. those other than arts at Oxford and Cambridge) are postgraduate qualifications (e.g. the BCL and BMus at Oxford). Many have been changed to the corresponding master&#x27;s degree (e.g. BSc is now MSc at Oxford), but only within the last generation. The BD (Bachelor of Divinity) remains a higher degree at some universities (e.g. Oxford, Cambridge, St Andrews and, until recently, Durham) but is an undergraduate degree at most (e.g. London, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Glasgow).

Bachelor&#x27;s degrees in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science, while undergraduate degrees, are longer courses and are considered to be master&#x27;s level qualifications in the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications and second cycle qualifications under the Bologna Process.

=== Bachelor/Master/Doctor of Philosophy ===

There is an international (but not universal) custom that certain degrees will be designated &#x27;... of Philosophy&#x27;. Examples are the BPhil (Bachelor of Philosophy), MPhil (Master of Philosophy) and PhD or DPhil (Doctor of Philosophy). Most recipients of such degrees have not engaged in a specialised study of academic philosophy - the degree is available for almost the whole range of disciplines. The origins lie in the ancient practice of regarding all areas of study as elements of &#x27;philosophy&#x27; with its Greek meaning, &#x27;friend of wisdom&#x27;. Thus holders of an MPhil degree may have earned it in any academic discipline.

==Foundation level qualifications==

These qualifications sit at level 5 (foundation level) of the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications and are short cycle (within or linked to the first cycle) qualifications under the Bologna Process.

See also Foundation degree.

* FDA - Foundation Degree of the Arts
* FDArts - Foundation Degree of the Arts
* FDEd - Foundation Degree of Education
* FdEng - Foundation of Engineering
* FDEng - Foundation Degree of Engineering
* FDS- Foundation Degree of Science
* FdSc - Foundation of Sciences
==Bachelor&#x27;s level qualifications==

These qualifications sit at level 6 (bachelor&#x27;s level) of the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications and are first cycle (end of cycle) qualifications under the Bologna Process.

Most British bachelor&#x27;s degrees are honours degrees and indicated by putting &quot;(Hons)&quot; after the degree abbreviation. A student achieving a pass grade, below honours standard, may be awarded an &quot;ordinary degree&quot; or a &quot;pass degree&quot; and may not add &quot;(Hons)&quot;.

As noted above, the MAs of the ancient universities of Scotland are also at this level and may also add &quot;(Hons)&quot; after their acronyms. Both these and bachelor&#x27;s degrees with honours at Scottish universities are four-year courses at level 10 of the Framework for Qualifications of Higher Education Institutes in Scotland. Scottish bachelor&#x27;s degrees without honours (including non-honours MAs from the ancient universities of Scotland) are three-year course with less specialisation (an &quot;Ordinary Degree&quot; or a &quot;General Degree&quot;) at level 9 of the Framework for Qualifications of Higher Education Institutes in Scotland.

==Master&#x27;s level qualifications==

These qualifications sit at level 7 (master&#x27;s level) of the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications and are second cycle qualifications under the Bologna Process.

===Undergraduate-entry degrees===

Undergraduate-entry &quot;Integrated master&#x27;s&quot; degrees are offered with honours, and so may add (hons) after the degree abbreviation. These are substantive master&#x27;s degrees integrating undergraduate and master&#x27;s level study, with the final qualification being at the same level as postgraduate master&#x27;s.

Primary qualifications in medicine, dentistry and veterinary medicine are taken as undergraduate-entry courses and are denominated bachelor&#x27;s degrees, but are normally offered without honours These are also qualifications at the same level as postgraduate master&#x27;s degrees, but retain the name of bachelor&#x27;s for historical reasons. The Bachelors of Medicine and Surgery are always taken together as the primary medical qualification in the UK, equivalent to the American MD.

Note that where there is a similarly titled postgraduate master&#x27;s degree, the formulation &quot; Master in ...&quot; is used for the undergraduate degree and &quot;Master of ...&quot; for the postgraduate degree (e.g. MArt/MA, MSci/MSc). Where there is no equivalent postgraduate degree, either &quot;in&quot; or &quot;of&quot; is used.

====Integrated master&#x27;s degrees====

===Postgraduate degrees===

Postgraduate master&#x27;s degrees may be either taught degrees or research degrees. Taught master&#x27;s degrees may be awarded by an institution with taught degree awarding powers; master&#x27;s degrees by research (e g MPhil, MRes), where over half of the student&#x27;s effort is in original research, require research degree awarding powers. Postgraduate degrees are not normally honours degrees and thus do not add &quot;(Hons)&quot;. Some degrees may be offered as either integrated master&#x27;s or postgraduate master&#x27;s courses at different institutes, e.g. MEng and MArch.

A few postgraduate degrees at Oxford are titled as bachelor&#x27;s degrees. These are, nonetheless, master&#x27;s level qualifications.

==Doctoral degrees==

UK doctoral degrees are at level 8 of the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications and are third cycle qualifications under the Bologna Process. All doctoral degrees include &quot;original research or other advanced scholarship&quot; demonstrating &quot;the creation and interpretation of new knowledge&quot;.

Due to the flexibility of Latin word order, there are two schools in the abbreviation of doctor&#x27;s degrees. The two ancient universities of England split on this: at Cambridge, D follows the faculty (e.g. PhD, LittD.), while at Oxford the D precedes the faculty (e.g. DPhil, DLitt). Most universities in the UK followed Oxford for the higher doctorates but followed international precedent in using PhD for Doctor of Philosophy and professional doctorates.

The Framework for Higher Education Qualifications lays down the naming convention that Doctor of Philosophy is reserved for doctorates awarded on the basis of examination by thesis or publication, or by artefact, composition or performance accompanied by written academic commentary. Other doctorates (typically styled professional or specialist doctorates) that have substantial taught elements normally include the field in the name of the degree.

Higher doctorates are normally awarded as honorary degrees (&quot;honoris causa&quot;), but can also be awarded on the basis of a substantial body of published work. DUniv is only ever an honorary degree. Some degrees awarded as higher doctorates by one institution may be awarded as professional doctorates by another (e.g. EngD).

<doc id="362675" wikidata="Q787276" url="?curid=362675" title="Interpleader">
<text>Interpleader is a civil procedure device that allows a plaintiff or a defendant to initiate a lawsuit in order to compel two or more other parties to litigate a dispute. An interpleader action originates when the plaintiff holds property on behalf of another, but does not know to whom the property should be transferred. It is often used to resolve disputes arising under insurance contracts, such as when a plaintiff with a personal injury claim has a dispute with medical providers over the payment out of a settlement for medical services provided to treat the plaintiff&#x27;s injuries.

==Terminology and overview==
In an interpleader action, the party initiating the litigation, normally the plaintiff, is termed the &quot;stakeholder&quot;. The money or other property in controversy is called the &quot;res&quot; (a Latin word meaning object or thing). All defendants having a possible interest in the subject matter of the case are called &quot;claimants&quot;. In some jurisdictions, the plaintiff is referred to as the &quot;plaintiff-in-interpleader&quot; and each claimant a &quot;claimant-in-interpleader&quot;.

An interpleader proceeding has two stages. The first stage determines if the stakeholder is entitled to an interpleader and if he should be discharged from liability. The second stage is like an action at law to determine which of the claimants is entitled to the res.

==Application==
Suppose a person dies with a valid life insurance policy in effect. The insurance company is ready, willing, and able to pay the policy proceeds in specified percentages to named beneficiaries as last directed by the policyholder, but becomes aware of a dispute among them and/or third parties as to who are the proper beneficiaries or the proper distribution of proceeds among the beneficiaries. Such a dispute commonly arises from interpersonal friction among the policyholder&#x27;s survivors. One specific situation commonly seen in the reported cases is where the policyholder was allegedly murdered by a beneficiary (which would disqualify that beneficiary from receiving any proceeds). 

To resolve such a dispute, the insurance company can file an interpleader action. The insurance company is the stakeholder, the claimants are the persons who might be beneficiaries under the policy, and the cash value of the policy benefit is the &quot;res&quot;. Under the proceeding as originally developed, the stakeholder would deposit the &quot;res&quot; with the court, and then the defendants would have their claims adjudicated by the court. Statutory modifications to the procedure, which vary by jurisdiction, sometimes allow the stakeholder to retain the &quot;res&quot; pending final disposition of the case. Typically, once the stakeholder deposits the &quot;res&quot; into the court (for example, the face value of the insurance policy), the stakeholder is released from the action and the claimants proceed against each other to determine which of them is legally entitled to the &quot;res&quot;. A disinterested stakeholder is entitled to costs including attorney&#x27;s fees. Except for the denominations of the parties, the action proceeds for the most part as other civil lawsuits in the same jurisdiction.

In some jurisdictions, the &quot;res&quot; will earn interest at the legal rate until disbursed. The successful claimant is entitled to the interest as well as the principal.

==History==
===Origins in common law and equity===
Interpleader had its origins as a civil procedure at common law, which was later adopted and expanded by the Court of Chancery in its equitable jurisprudence. The common law procedure became obsolete over time and fell into disuse, but it remained active in the courts of equity.

It originally applied to bailees subject to multiple actions of detinue, and privity was required either between the parties or in detinue, in order for the defendant to be able to sue for garnishment.

In contrast, the equitable bill of interpleader required that:

# The same thing, debt, or duty must be the &quot;res&quot; claimed by all the claimants;
# All the adverse titles or claims must be dependent or derived from a common source;
# The stakeholder must not have or claim any interest it the &quot;res&quot;, 
# The stakeholder must have incurred no independent liability to any claimant, i.e. he must be perfectly indifferent between them.

===Subsequent development in England and Wales===
In 1831 Parliament passed the Interpleader Act 1831 that authorized a bill of interpleader to be brought in the common law courts (such as the Court of Common Pleas) by:

:*sheriffs who have executed on goods or chattels that a third party makes a claim to, and defendants in actions of assumpsit, debt, detinue or trover, who:
::* do not claim any interest in the subject of the subject matter of the suit, but the right to them is claimed or supposed to belong to a third party who has sued or expect to sue for the subject matter of the suit;
::* has not colluded in any matter with such third party
::* is ready to bring into court or pay or depose of the subject matter of the action in such manner as the court directs.

Statutory interpleader was extended by Common Law Procedure Act 1860, which allowed a defendant to interplead claimants even if the title of the claimants to the &quot;res&quot; have no common origin, but are adverse to and independent of one another.

The statutory rules governing interpleader proceedings were replaced by rules of court that came into force upon the passage of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (as amended by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1875), which came to be known as Order 17 of the Rules of the Supreme Court. A similar provision was enacted in the County Court Rules, known as Order 33 in the Rules of 1981.

In cases where a person was subject to multiple claims, the applicant had to show that he:

:* claimed no interest in the subject-matter in dispute other than for charges or costs;
:* did not collude with any of the claimants to that subject-matter; and
:* was willing to pay or transfer that subject-matter into court or to dispose of it as the court may direct.

As a result of the coming into force of Part 3 and Schedule 12 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 on 6 April 2014, Order 17 and Order 33 were replaced by the new Parts 83-86 of the Civil Procedure Rules. This replaced the interpleader proceedings previously governed by the court rules by the procedure of &quot;enforcement by taking control of goods&quot; under newly passed regulations. In addition, s. 65 of the 2007 Act declared:

Procedures are in effect for claims where:

:(a) a person makes an application to the court claiming that goods of which control has been taken belong to that person and not to the debtor;
:(b) a person makes an application to the court claiming that goods, money or chattels taken or intended to be taken under a writ of execution or the proceeds or value of such goods or chattels belong to that person and not to the debtor; and
:(c) a debtor, whose goods have been made subject to an enforcement power under an enactment, writ or warrant of control or have been taken or are intended to be taken under a writ of execution, claims that such goods or any of them are exempt goods.

The 2014 amendments have proved to be problematic, in that they now fail to cover a situation where:

:* a third party has given notice that they believe they are entitled to the goods under Rule 85.4(1),
:* a counter-notice is duly given by the creditor under Rule 85.4(3), but
:* the third party then fails to commence the application to the court which is required under Rule 85.5, and
:* the provisions of Rule 85.5 impose no time limit by which the application under that Rule must be made by the creditor or other party claiming an interest.

In February 2018, several High Court enforcement officers asked the Queen&#x27;s Bench Division for directions as to how to proceed in such circumstances, and the Master ruled that the repeal of Rule 17 had the effect of reviving the equitable form of interpleader proceedings, as the 2007 Act did not expressly abolish the interpleader action itself, and &quot;interpleader statutes are not at all to limit or affect the equitable jurisdiction of the court to entertain an interpleader suit or action.&quot;

===In the United States===
Formerly a plaintiff had to disavow any claim to the &quot;res&quot; in order to avail himself of the interpleader remedy, but this requirement has also been relaxed or abolished in most jurisdictions by there being a Bill in the Nature of Interpleader rather than a strict bill of interpleader. A plaintiff may now argue that neither of the claimants has a right to the property at issue. For example, a person dies with a life insurance policy that excludes coverage for suicide. Two people come forward claiming to be the beneficiary named in the policy. The insurance company believes that the deceased committed suicide, but the claimants believe the death was by accident. The insurance company could interplead the two claimants and simultaneously deny the claims.

The Supreme Court of the United States ruled in &quot;New York Life v. Dunlevy&quot; , that for a claimant to be bound by an interpleader that party must be served process in a way that obtains personal jurisdiction. In 1922 the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Liberty Oil Co. v. Condon Nat. Bank&quot; sustained that a defensive interpeader in an action at law in federal court could be taken under Judicial Code section 274b added by that authorized the interposing of equitable defenses in actions at law.

The Federal Interpleader Act of 1917 was enacted by the 64th United States Congress approved February 22, 1917 to overcome the problem with an interpleader when the claimants live in different states raised in &quot;New York Life v. Dunlevy&quot;. The Federal Interpleader Act of 1917 allowed an insurance company, or fraternal benefit society subject to multiple claims on the same policy to file a suit in equity by a bill of interpleader in United States district courts and providing nationwide service of process. The policy must have a value of at least $500 claimed were claimed or may be claimed by adverse claimants; which is less than the amount in controversy of $3,000 in Judicial Code §48(1) then required for general diversity jurisdiction and two or more of the beneficiaries must live in different states. In 1926 it was repealed and replaced by, approved May 8, 1926, which added to those who can bring suit casualty company and surety company, empowered the court to enjoin claimant from proceeding in any state or other federal court on the same liability, adding provisions as to the proper venue for the interpleader in certain cases but required that there must be actual claims by eliminating the words &quot;may claim&quot; that were in the 1917 act. In 1936 the Federal Interpeader Act was again repealed and replaced by the Federal Interpleader Act of 1936, , approved Jan. 20, 1936, drafted by Zechariah Chafee which codified it in as United States Judicial Code §41(26), and established the modern statutory interpleader allowing suit to be brought by any person, firm, corporation, association or society having custody of money or property or insurance policy or instrument valued at $500 or more which there are two or more adverse claimant who are citizens of different states, whether or not the claims have common origins, identical, adverse or independent of each other, and allowed it to be an equitable defense in actions at law, Judicial Code §274b. When the United States Judicial Code was enacted into United States Code as positive law in 1948, approved June 25, 1948, it was reconstituted as , , and .

Federal courts have held that because of the deposit of the &quot;res&quot; with the court an interpleader action is an action to determine the validity of competing claims to identified property that served may be under which authorize other forms of service to obtain &quot;in rem jurisdiction&quot; over absent defendants.

==Different types of interpleader in U.S. federal practice==
There are two specific types of interpleader actions in the United States federal courts. Statutory Interpleader governed by , and Rule Interpleader established by Federal Rules of Civil Procedure .

=== Statutory interpleader===
* allows an individual with a stake which is, or may be, claimed by two or more adverse claimants, to interplead those claimants and bring them into a singular action.
* Jurisdiction: Under , a person anywhere within the United States may be served by the stakeholder
* Diversity: Diversity jurisdiction is satisfied as long as there are two claimants of different states . For example, if you have three claimants, two of which are residents of Florida, and one from California, diversity would be satisfied. The diversity of the stakeholder, however, is irrelevant to the rule. This is known as minimal diversity and was held to be permissible under Article III, § 2 of the United States Constitution, &quot;State Farm Fire and Cas. Co. v. Tashire&quot; 
* Amount in controversy: The stake in the claim (amount in controversy) must be &quot;greater than or equal&quot; to $500 in value , opposed to the Rule Interpleader requirement of any amount &quot;exceeding&quot; $75,000 in diversity based actions . 
* Venue: The venue for a Statutory Interpleader is in the Judicial District in which one of the claimants resides, .
* Deposit: A Statutory Interpleader action is commenced by the stakeholder who must initially deposit with the court, the amount in controversy, or post a specific bond with the court, . The stakeholder may, however, at trial claim they don&#x27;t owe money to the claimants at all, since the action can be in the nature of interpleader. 
Such an action may be entertained although the titles or claims of the conflicting claimants do not have a common origin, or are not identical, but are adverse to and independent of one another. .
* Injunction: Once the statutory interpleader action is commenced, the court may restrict all claimants from starting or continuing any action which would affect the stake, make such injunction permanent, and discharge the stakeholder from liability. . Such injunction is not governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure Rule .

The may claim language added in 1948 codification to Title 28 of the United States Code in the definitions of claim allow interpleader for unliquidated claims, such as multiple claimant to a liability insurance policy injured in an accident before they are reduced to judgment or settled, however the injunction may only restrain the claimants from suits making claims against the &quot;res&quot; not suits to liquidate the claim or against third parties. The procedures for a Statutory Interpleader action are governed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 22(b).

=== Rule interpleader ===
Interpleader is also allowed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure . Rule 22 is known as rule interpleader. Rule interpleader provides a remedy for any person who is, or may be exposed to double or multiple liabilities. The stakeholder may invoke Rule 22 as a plaintiff, or by counter-claiming in an action already started against him by one, or more claimants. There are specific differences between Statutory Interpleader, and Rule Interpleader:
* Jurisdiction: Rule Interpleader does not provide a basis for jurisdiction in the United States District Court; there must be an independent basis of jurisdiction under Title 28 of the United States Code, i.e., diversity jurisdiction which requires that the claimants have complete diversity between the stakeholder, and all claimants; but not between the claimants, or federal question jurisdiction i.e., when a claim is based on federal law; or there is a specific statute authorizing interpleader i.e., or .
* Service: There is no nationwide service of process as in a statutory interpleader action. Service must be carried out within the state where the court sits, or according to the long-arm statute of the state, Rule 4(k)(1).
* Amount in Controversy: The amount in controversy must exceed $75,000 if based on diversity jurisdiction meeting the requirements of .
* Deposit: There is no deposit required to be made with the court for a Rule 22 interpleader action. The stakeholder may claim that they are not liable in whole, or part, to any or all the claimants, Rule 22(a)(1)(B). However for the stakeholder to be discharged he must deposit the money or property with the court pursuant to Rule .

==== Bankruptcy ====
In bankruptcy court interpleader under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure may be maintained as an adversary proceeding under Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure .

====Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 22 ====

==Interpleader in U.S. State practice==
The Uniform Commercial Code §7-603 adopted in all 50 of the states of the United States provides that a bailee may bring an interpleader as an original action or as a defense to a suit for nondelivery when more than one person claims title to or possession of the goods under document of title (warehouse receipt or bill of lading).

In Louisiana interpleader is called concursus. In most states there are statutes or court rules that provide for interpleader similar to the federal rules.

<doc id="362677" wikidata="Q849816" url="?curid=362677" title="Rock candy">
<text>Rock candy or [[sugar]] candy, also called rock sugar, or crystal sugar, is a type of confection composed of relatively large sugar crystals. In some parts of the world, local variations are called Misri, nabat or navat. 

This candy is formed by allowing a supersaturated solution of sugar and water to crystallize onto a surface suitable for crystal nucleation, such as a string, stick, or plain granulated sugar. Heating the water before adding the sugar allows more sugar to dissolve thus producing larger crystals. Crystals form after six to seven days. Food coloring may be added to the mixture to produce colored candy.

==Nomenclature==
Etymologically, &quot;sugar candy&quot; derives from late 13th century English (in reference to &quot;crystallized sugar&quot;), from Old French &quot;çucre candi&quot; (meaning &quot;sugar candy&quot;), and ultimately from Arabic &quot;qandi&quot;, from Persian &quot;qand&quot; (&quot;cane sugar&quot;), probably from Sanskrit &quot;khanda&quot; (&quot;piece of sugar)&quot;, The sense gradually broadened (especially in the United States) to mean by the late 19th century &quot;any confection having sugar as its basis&quot;. In Britain, these are sweets, and &quot;candy&quot; tends to be restricted to sweets made only from boiled sugar and striped in bright colors.

The modern American term &quot;rock candy&quot; (referring to brittle large natural sugar crystals) should not be confused with the British term rock (referring to an amorphous and opaque boiled sugar product, initially hard but then chewy at mouth temperature).

==Origins==
Islamic writers in the first half of the 9th century described the production of candy sugar, where crystals were grown through cooling supersaturated sugar solutions. One of the famed makers of rock candy in the Muslim east is Hafiz Mustafa in 1864 in Istanbul founded during the reign of Sultan Abdulaziz.

According to the production process, rock sugar is divided into two types: single crystal rock sugar and polycrystalline rock sugar.

==Cuisine==
Rock candy is often dissolved in tea. It is an important part of the tea culture of East Frisia, where a lump of rock sugar is placed at the bottom of the cup. Rock candy consumed with tea is also the most common and popular way of drinking tea in Iran, where it is called &quot;nabat&quot;; the most popular nabat flavor is saffron. This method of drinking tea can also be found in Central Asia as &quot;novvot&quot;.

It is a common ingredient in Chinese cooking. In China, it is used to sweeten chrysanthemum tea, as well as Cantonese dessert soups and the liquor &quot;baijiu&quot;. Many households have rock candy available to marinate meats, add to stir fry, and to prepare food such as yao shan. In less modern times, rock sugar was a luxury only for the wealthy. Rock candy is also regarded as having medicinal properties, and in some Chinese provinces, it is used as a part of traditional Chinese medicine.

Rock candy is used a lot in other countries. In Mexico, it is used during the Day of the Dead to make sugar skulls, often highly decorated. Sugar skulls are given to children so they will not fear death; they are also offered to the dead. In the Friesland province of the Netherlands, bits of rock candy are baked in the luxury white bread &quot;Fryske Sûkerbôle&quot;. Rock candy is a common ingredient in Tamil cuisine, particularly in the Sri Lankan city of Jaffna. In the US, rock candy comes in many colors and flavors, and is slightly hard to find, due to it being considered old-fashioned.

==Misri==
Misri refers to crystallized sugar lumps, and a type of confectionery mineral, which has its origins in India and Iran, also known as rock sugar elsewhere. It is used in India as a type of candy, or used to sweeten milk or tea.

Among Indian misri dishes are &quot;mishri-mawa&quot; (&quot;kalakand&quot;), &quot;mishri-peda&quot;, which are more commonly eaten in Northern-Western India, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan, Punjab, Odisha,
Gujarat, North coastal of Andhra Pradesh and many other states and parts of India.

The Ghantewala Halwai of Delhi, who started his career by selling &quot;Misri mawa&quot; in 1790 is famous for Misari mawa and sells 40 varieties of sweets made from Misari.

==Beverages==
Rock and rye is a term used both for alcoholic liqueurs and cocktails using rye whiskey and rock candy, as well as for non-alcoholic beverages made in imitation thereof, such as the &quot;Rock &amp; Rye&quot; flavor of soda pop made by Faygo.

<doc id="362680" wikidata="Q827316" url="?curid=362680" title="New Jersey Route 173">
<text>Route 173 is a state highway in New Jersey, United States that is a designation for an old section of U.S. Route 22 (US 22). The route runs from Interstate 78 (I-78) and US 22 in Pohatcong Township, Warren County to County Route 626 (CR 626, Beaver Avenue) in Clinton Township, Hunterdon County, just east of an interchange with Route 31. Route 173 parallels I-78 and US 22 for its entire length through rural areas of Warren and Hunterdon counties, passing through the towns of Bloomsbury and Clinton along the way. At one point just to the west of Clinton, Route 173 runs concurrent with I-78 and US 22.

The route was originally part of pre-1927 Route 9 from 1916 until 1927, when it became part of US 22 and Route 28. The Route 28 designation was removed from this portion of road in 1953. When I-78 was being built between exits 11 and 13 in the 1950s and 1960s, it was decided that part of US 22 would be used for the new highway. The eastbound lanes of US 22 became the westbound lanes of the new highway, the eastbound lanes of the new highway were newly constructed, and the westbound lanes of US 22 were turned into a two-lane road. In 1969, US 22 was moved to the alignment of I-78 between Pohatcong Township and Clinton Township and Route 173 was designated along most of the former alignment of US 22.

==Route description==
Route 173 begins at an interchange with Interstate 78 and U.S. Route 22 in Pohatcong Township, Warren County, where the route continues to the northwest as part of U.S. Route 22, a six-lane, divided highway that heads towards Phillipsburg. From this interchange, Route 173 heads east on a two-lane, undivided road that parallels Interstate 78/U.S. Route 22 to the south, immediately entering Greenwich Township and passing through farmland and some suburban residential developments. County Route 644 (Greenwich Church Road) loops to the north of Route 173 as the route features three crossings of the Pohatcong Creek. Route 173 intersects County Route 637 (Main Street/Maple Drive), County Route 639 (Warren Glen Road), and the northern terminus of County Route 579 (Church Street). Past the County Route 579 intersection, the route parallels the Musconetcong River and intersects County Route 632 (Asbury Road), which provides access to westbound Interstate 78/U.S. Route 22.

Route 173 crosses the Musconetcong River into Bloomsbury, Hunterdon County. It comes to another interchange with Interstate 78/U.S. Route 22, where Route 173 takes on the name Brunswick Pike and closely parallels the interstate to the north. The route enters Bethlehem Township and passes under Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Central Running Track line, continuing east through farmland The route parallels Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Lehigh Line for a short distance, running farther to the north of Interstate 78/U.S. Route 22, before intersecting County Route 643 (West Portal-Asbury Road). Past this intersection, Route 173 heads south and then east through the Musconetcong Mountains as a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane. The route crosses into Union Township, where it becomes Old Highway 22.
The route becomes a divided highway and meets County Route 614 (Little York Road) at a traffic circle near an interchange with Interstate 78/U.S. Route 22. Route 173 has direct ramps to and from the westbound direction of the interstate with access to and from the eastbound direction provided by way of County Route 614. Route 173 narrows back to a two-lane, undivided road and closely follows Interstate 78/U.S. Route 22 to the north, meeting County Route 625 (Mechlin Corner Road) and County Route 635 (Charlestown Road) near another interchange with Interstate 78/U.S. Route 22. There is direct access to and from the westbound direction of Interstate 78/U.S. Route 22 while access to and from the eastbound direction of Interstate 78/U.S. Route 22 is provided by County Route 625. The route continues east and splits into a one-way pair. At this point, eastbound Route 173 crosses over Interstate 78/U.S. Route 22 and makes a left turn to merge onto eastbound Interstate 78/U.S. Route 22. The westbound direction of Route 173 splits from Interstate 78/U.S. Route 22 and continues west to join back with eastbound Route 173.
Route 173 follows Interstate 78/U.S. Route 22 for a little over a mile in Franklin Township until an interchange County Route 513 (Pittstown Road), where the eastbound direction merges onto this route and heads into Clinton. It meets the westbound direction of Route 173, which splits at this point and heads west on West Main Street to merge into westbound Interstate 78/U.S. Route 22 in Union Township. In Clinton, Route 173 crosses over the South Branch Raritan River and splits from County Route 513 where that route heads north on Leigh Street. The route crosses into Clinton Township and it features ramps connecting to Interstate 78/U.S. Route 22, with access from westbound Route 173 to westbound Interstate 78/U.S. Route 22 and from eastbound Interstate 78/U.S. Route 22 to eastbound Route 173. Route 173 turns north to interchange with Route 31 and end at County Route 626 (Beaver Avenue).

==History==
Prior to 1927, Route 173 was part of Pre-1927 Route 9, which was designated in 1917 to run from Phillipsburg to Elizabeth. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, the route became Route 28. In addition, it was also designated as part of U.S. Route 22. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering, which eliminated long concurrencies between U.S. and State Routes, the Route 28 designation was removed along this portion of the route, leaving U.S. Route 22 the sole number along the route. In the late 1950s, construction began on Interstate 78 through the area. Construction of the portion of Interstate 78 built between Exit 11 (County Route 614) and Exit 13 in Union Township, completed in 1962, modified the alignment of U.S. Route 22 between these two points. It involved the creation of new eastbound lanes for Interstate 78 and conversion of the eastbound lanes of U.S. Route 22 into the westbound lanes of Interstate 78. The westbound lanes of U.S. Route 22 were turned into a two-lane frontage road. In 1969, U.S. Route 22 was moved to the Interstate 78 alignment between Exit 3 in Pohatcong Township and Exit 18 in Clinton Township. The former U.S. Route 22 became Route 173 between Exit 3 and Route 31 in Clinton Township, with the remainder of the former U.S. Route 22 alignment becoming county-maintained Beaver Avenue (currently County Route 626).

<doc id="362694" wikidata="Q7497567" url="?curid=362694" title="Shining Time Station">
<text>Shining Time Station is a children&#x27;s television series jointly created by British television producer Britt Allcroft and American television producer Rick Siggelkow. The series was produced by Quality Family Entertainment (the American branch of The Britt Allcroft Company), in association with Catalyst Entertainment in seasons 2 and 3, for New York City&#x27;s PBS station WNET, and was originally taped in New York City during its first season and in Toronto during the rest of its run. It incorporated sequences from the British television show &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends&quot;, which was in turn based on the books of &quot;The Railway Series&quot; written by the Reverend Wilbert Awdry.

The series aired on PBS from January 29, 1989, until June 11, 1993, with four hour-long &quot;Family Specials&quot; premiering in primetime throughout 1995. Reruns continued to air on PBS until June 11, 1998. &quot;Shining Time Station&quot; reruns aired on Fox Family from 1998 to 1999, and on Nick Jr. from June to August 2000 to promote the theatrical release of &quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot;. The series also aired on Canadian television networks such as APTN and SCN. Elements from the show were incorporated into the 2000 film &quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot;.

The initial 1989 season featured a cast that included Ringo Starr as Mr. Conductor, Didi Conn as Stacy Jones, Brian O&#x27;Connor as Horace Schemer, Leonard Jackson as Harry Cupper, Jason Woliner as Matt Jones and Nicole Leach as Tanya Cupper. Following a Christmas special with the original cast, the show was retooled for the second (1991) and third (1993) seasons, with only Conn and O&#x27;Connor reprising their prior roles. George Carlin replaced Starr as Mr. Conductor, while Erica Luttrell, Ari Magder, Danielle Marcot, and Tom Jackson joined the primary cast in newly created roles. The series concluded with four &quot;Family Specials&quot;, aired in 1995. Providing the musical numbers for the show was The Jukebox Band, a group of puppets.

In 1996, Carlin appeared in a spin-off series called &quot;Mr. Conductor&#x27;s Thomas Tales&quot;, which featured only six episodes with five Thomas stories and one music video each. The station interior was kept for the spin-off.

==Background==
After the success of &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends&quot; in the United Kingdom, Britt Allcroft and her production company teamed up with PBS station WNET in New York City to produce and distribute the sitcom-esque &quot;Shining Time Station&quot;, every episode of which would include a couple of episodes of &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends&quot;. The series starred Ringo Starr, George Carlin, Didi Conn, Brian O&#x27;Connor, and the Flexitoon Puppets. Ringo Starr, who had already been providing the narration for the British series, agreed to extend the role to include the on-screen character called Mr. Conductor in &quot;Shining Time Station&quot;. He left the show after its initial season to focus on his musical career and was replaced by George Carlin.

&quot;Shining Time Station&quot; received critical acclaim. In a review for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Ken Tucker states that, compared to the faster paced &quot;Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego?&quot;, &quot;&#x27;Shining Time Station&#x27; wants to slow things down. It&#x27;s an old-fashioned show that creates a gentle, lulling atmosphere to convince children that life is fun and that trains are the way to travel.&quot; It was a ratings success as well. In its first season, the show averaged a 0.9 Nielsen rating, translating to about 1.2 million viewers on average. At the peak of its popularity, the show brought in up to 7.5 million viewers per week.

==Overview==
The Shining Time Station is a fictional train station on the Indian Valley Railroad in an unknown part of the United States. It is managed by Stacy Jones. Its workshop is run in the first season by Harry Cupper, and thereafter by Billy Twofeathers. A local named Horace Schemer, simply referred to as Schemer, runs the station&#x27;s arcade and serves as the series&#x27; comic relief. He often comes up with tricks and schemes (hence his surname) to get his ways, although they usually backfire on him as a result of his foolishness. The narrative is driven by regular and incidental visitors to the station.

Mr. Conductor is a tiny man who lives in a signal house inside the station&#x27;s mural and tells the stories taken from &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends&quot; to the kids. He also introduces songs to the kids in the Anything Tunnel. Sometimes, he may present a magic bubble to the kids that has the song inside as a way of introducing it. On occasion, the kids may look through a film viewer to see the song or film.

<text>Abdominoplasty or &quot;tummy tuck&quot; is a cosmetic surgery procedure used to make the abdomen thinner and more firm. The surgery involves the removal of excess skin and fat from the middle and lower abdomen in order to tighten the muscle and fascia of the abdominal wall. This type of surgery is usually sought by patients with loose or sagging tissues, that develop after pregnancy or major weight loss.

==History==

Modern abdominoplasties were developed starting in the 1960s. Heavier populations have led to increased demand for the surgeries, while technological advancements have improved their quality.

==Procedures==
Abdominoplasty operations vary in scope and are frequently subdivided into categories. Depending on the extent of the surgery, a complete abdominoplasty can take from 1 to 5 hours. A partial abdominoplasty (mini-tuck abdominoplasty) can be completed between 1 and 2 hours.

===Complete abdominoplasty===
In general, a complete or full abdominoplasty follows these steps:
# An incision is made from hip to hip just above the pubic area.
# Another incision is made to free the navel from the surrounding skin.
# The skin is detached from the abdominal wall to reveal the muscles and fascia to be tightened. The muscle fascia wall is tightened with sutures.
# Liposuction is often used to refine the transition zones of the abdominal sculpture.
# A dressing and sometimes a compression garment are applied and any excess fluid from the site is drained.

===Partial abdominoplasty===
A partial or mini abdominoplasty proceeds as follows:
# A smaller incision is made.
# The skin and fat of the lower abdomen are detached in a more limited fashion from the muscle fascia. The skin is stretched down and excess skin removed.
# Sometimes the belly button stalk is divided from the muscle below and the belly button slid down lower on the abdominal wall.
# Sometimes a portion of the abdominal muscle fascia wall is tightened.
# Liposuction is often used to contour the transition zone.
# The flap is stitched back into place.

===Extended abdominoplasty===
An extended abdominoplasty is a complete abdominoplasty plus a lateral thigh lift. The resulting scar runs from the posterior axillary line (when placing one&#x27;s open hands on the hips, the thumbs lie along the posterior axillary line). The operation does all of the abdominal contouring of a complete abdominoplasty and allows further improvement of the flank (waist), as well as smoothing the contour of the upper lateral thigh.

===High lateral tension tummy tuck===
This is an advanced technique that takes a little more than four and half hours to perform. Conventional abdominoplasty tightens muscles in a vertical line. In this new method, known as high lateral tension abdominoplasty, in addition to vertical-line tightening, muscles are tightened horizontally. The result with this technique is a dramatically flat abdomen with significantly better-defined waistline.

===Floating abdominoplasty or FAB technique===
This new technique, also known as an extended mini abdominoplasty, allows for tightening and shaping through a smaller incision that is not placed around the belly button. Through this smaller incision, excess skin is removed and the belly button is temporarily detached, floating above the muscles during this process. The muscles are tightened and reshaped from sternum to pubic area. The skin is then tightened and the belly button is reattached, or moved down one or two cm if desired. Liposuction may also be performed to achieve desirable results.

===Circumferential abdominoplasty===
A circumferential abdominoplasty is an extended abdominoplasty plus a buttock lift. The resulting scar runs all the way around the body, and the operation is also called a Belt Lipectomy or lower body lift. This operation is most appropriate for patients who have undergone massive weight loss.

===Combination procedures===
An abdominoplasty can be combined with liposuction to make a Lipotuck, which performs body contouring around the hips, thighs, and buttocks.

It can also be combined with liposuction contouring, breast reduction, breast lift, or occasionally hysterectomy, depending on the reason for the hysterectomy. A popular name for multiple surgeries performed in the same surgical session including a cosmetic breast procedure with or without liposuction and an abdominoplasty is called a &quot;mommy makeover&quot;.

==Risks==
Abdominoplasty is considered to be a safe procedure, but the risk of complication is higher than in other cosmetic surgeries. Possible complications include seromas, infection, necrosis of the skin, and hematomas.

==Related procedures==
Liposuction, also known as lipoplasty, is a type of surgery that removes fat from the human body in an attempt to change its shape.

Abdominoplasty is one type of body contouring, which is plastic surgery performed on different parts of the body with the aim of improving the shape and tone of the underlying tissue that supports fat.

Breast reduction, or reduction mammoplasty, is the cosmetic surgery used in resizing the breast, in women with oversized breasts and men with gynecomastia. This type of surgery is performed to treat a breast condition known as hypertrophy, which refers to oversized breasts. This condition usually occurs in both breasts and commonly develops at puberty or immediately after.

Breast lift, also referred to as mastopexy, is the surgical procedure that removes the excess skin and tightens the surrounding tissue of the breast, resulting in raising and firming the breast. Mastopexies carry a certain degree of risks as any other type of surgery does.

Hysterectomies are sometimes performed with abdominoplasty. A hysterectomy consists in removing the uterus and it may be complete (when the body, fundus and cervix are removed) or partial (when only the uterine body is surgically removed). This procedure is normally performed by gynecologists and it is one of the most common gynecological surgeries. This type of surgery is used to treat some benign tumors, cancers of the ovaries, uterus or cervix, Adenomyosis but not endometriosis and are also performed in trans men.

<text>Ferdinand Freiligrath (17 June 1810 – 18 March 1876) was a German poet, translator and liberal agitator, who is considered part of the Young Germany movement.

==Life==
Freiligrath was born in Detmold, Principality of Lippe. His father was a teacher. He left a Detmold gymnasium at 16 to be trained for a commercial career in Soest. There he also familiarized himself with French and English literature, and before he was 20 had published verses in local journals. He worked in Amsterdam from 1831 to 1836 as a banker&#x27;s clerk. After publishing translations of Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Odes&quot; and &quot;Chants du crépuscule&quot;, and launching a literary journal, &quot;Rheinisches Odeon&quot; (1836–38), in 1837 he started working as a bookkeeper in Barmen, where he remained until 1839. Later on, he started writing poems for the &quot;Musen-Almanach&quot; (edited by Adelbert von Chamisso and Gustav Schwab) and the &quot;Morgenblatt&quot; (ed. Cotta).

His first collection of poems (&quot;Gedichte&quot;) was published in 1838 in Mainz. This contained his poems &quot;Löwenritt&quot;, &quot;Prinz Eugen&quot;, and &quot;Der Blumen Rache&quot;. His early poems were inspired by Victor Hugo&#x27;s &quot;Orientales&quot;, which he also partly translated into German; they often dealt with exotic subjects. The poem &quot;Der Mohrenfürst&quot;, for example, tells the story of a black prince who was a fierce warrior. He is defeated in battle, sold as a slave and ends up as a drummer in a circus, only the lion&#x27;s skin he wore that now decorates the drum still reminding him of his previous life. This poem was set as a song by Carl Loewe.

His 1838 book of poems won immediate and wide favour, and he decided upon a literary career which he embarked upon in 1839. He cooperated in several now unimportant works, and in 1842 received a pension of 300 thalers from the Prussian king, Frederick William IV. He married, and, to be near his friend Emanuel Geibel, settled at St. Goar.

Freiligrath was a friend of the American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. In 1842, when Longfellow was taking a rigorous water cure at a health spa in the former Marienberg Benedictine Convent at Boppard on the Rhine, a fellow patient introduced him to Freiligrath at the latter&#x27;s home in St. Goar. Freiligrath had a special interest in English and American poetry. There followed many meetings and outings in Germany where this topic was discussed, and Longfellow presented Freiligrath with copies of his books &quot;Hyperion&quot; and &quot;Ballads and Other Poems&quot;. The friendship developed further in their correspondence.

Due to political repression (censorship), and the encouragement of fellow poet Hoffmann von Fallersleben, Freiligrath later became more political. In 1844, he surrendered his pension, and in his &quot;Glaubensbekenntnis&quot; (Confession of Faith) placed his poetic gifts at the service of the democratic agitation that was to culminate in the Revolution of 1848. Such poems as &quot;Trotz alledem&quot; (a translation of Burns&#x27;s &quot;A man&#x27;s a man for a&#x27; that&quot;), &quot;Die Freiheit&quot;, &quot;Das Recht&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot; made his absence from Germany expedient.

He left for Belgium where he met Karl Marx. From there, he proceeded to Switzerland and then to London, publishing in 1846 &quot;Englische Gedichte aus neuerer Zeit&quot;, a volume of translations, and &quot;Ça ira&quot;, a collection of political songs. He lived until 1848 in England, where he resumed his commercial career. At the invitation of Longfellow, he considered going to America, but on the short-lived triumph of liberalism returned to Germany as a democratic leader. In 1843, Franz Liszt set Freiligrath&#x27;s poem &quot;O lieb, so lang du lieben kannst&quot; to music, published in 1847 — the song was later arranged by Liszt for solo piano as his &quot;Liebesträume&quot; No. 3 (1850), which subsequently became one of his most famous piano pieces. German composer Elise Schmezer set Freiligrath’s text to music in her &quot;Lieder, Romanzen und Balladen fur Tenor, opus 4.&quot;

Upon his return to Germany, Freiligrath settled in Düsseldorf, and worked for the &quot;Neue Rheinische Zeitung&quot; (general editor: Karl Marx, editor of cultural pages: Georg Weerth), a paper which he cofounded with Marx, Friedrich Engels and Wilhelm Wolff. It was not long before he had again called down upon himself the ill-will of the ruling powers by a poem, &quot;Die Toten an die Lebenden&quot; (The Dead to the Living, 1848). He was arrested on a charge of &quot;lèse-majesté&quot;, but the prosecution ended in his acquittal. This trial, in which he was acquitted, is memorable for another reason, being the first jury trial ever held in Prussia. He published &quot;Zwischen den Garben&quot; (1849) and &quot;Neue politische und soziale Gedichte&quot; (New Political and Social Poems, 1850). New difficulties arose; his association with the democratic movement rendered him an object of constant suspicion, and in 1851 he judged it more prudent to go back to London. There he became the director of the London branch of the Schweizer Generalbank and set up residence in the north-east of the city at 3 Sutton Place, Hackney. He remained in London until 1868, supporting himself by office work and poetic translations, among which were an anthology, the &quot;Rose, Thistle, and Shamrock&quot; (1854), Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;Hiawatha&quot; (1857), and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Cymbeline&quot; and &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;. These kept up his popularity in Germany, where in 1866 a subscription of 60,000 thalers was raised for him, partly as a political manifesto.

Back in Germany after the amnesty of 1868, Freiligrath settled first in Stuttgart and in 1875 in the neighbouring town of Cannstatt. He became a nationalist, publishing the patriotic poems &quot;Hurrah, Germania!&quot; and &quot;Die Trompete von Vionville&quot;, inspired by Germany&#x27;s victory in the Franco-Prussian War. His 1848 poem &quot;In Kümmernis und Dunkelheit&quot; attributed military symbolism to the colors of the German tricolor flag (which at the time stood only for the nation, not any political entity): the black was for gunpowder, the red for blood and the yellow the glow given off by the fire. He died in Cannstatt in 1876.

Among the first writers to translate Freiligrath into English was the Irish poet James Clarence Mangan (in the latter&#x27;s &quot;Anthologia Germanica&quot;, no. XIX, published in the Dublin University Magazine in 1845). A selection, by his daughter, from the English translations of his poems was published in the Tauchnitz &quot;Collection of German Authors&quot; (Leipzig, 1869).
