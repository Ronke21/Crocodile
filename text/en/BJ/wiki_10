<text>Paulette Goddard (born Marion Levy; June 3, 1910 – April 23, 1990) was an American actress and socialite. Her career spanned six decades, from the 1920s to the early 1970s. She was a prominent leading actress during the Golden Age of Hollywood.

Born in New York City and raised in Kansas City, Missouri, Goddard initially began her career as a child fashion model and performer in several Broadway productions as a Ziegfeld Girl. In the early 1930s, she moved to Hollywood and gained notice as the romantic partner of actor and comedian Charlie Chaplin, appearing as his leading lady in &quot;Modern Times&quot; (1936) and &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; (1940). After signing with Paramount Pictures, Goddard became one of the studio&#x27;s biggest stars with roles in &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot; (1939) with Bob Hope, &quot;The Women&quot; (1939) with Joan Crawford, &quot;North West Mounted Police&quot; (1940) with Gary Cooper, &quot;Reap the Wild Wind&quot; (1942) with John Wayne and Susan Hayward, &quot;So Proudly We Hail!&quot; (1943) (for which she received a nomination for Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress), &quot;Kitty&quot; (1945) with Ray Milland, and &quot;Unconquered&quot; (1947) with Gary Cooper.

Goddard was noted as a fiercely independent woman for her time, being described by one executive as &quot;dynamite&quot;. Her marriages to Chaplin, the actor Burgess Meredith, and the writer Erich Maria Remarque received substantial media attention. Following her marriage to Remarque, Goddard moved to Switzerland and largely retired from acting. In the 1980s, she became a notable socialite. Goddard died in Switzerland in 1990.

==Early life==
Goddard was born in New York City, as Marion Levy, the daughter of Joseph Russell Le Vee, the son of a prosperous cigar manufacturer from Salt Lake City, and Alta Mae Goddard. Her parents separated and divorced in 1926. According to Goddard, her father left them, but according to J. R. Le Vee, Alta absconded with the child to avoid a custody battle, she and her mother moved often during her childhood, including relocating to Canada at one point. Goddard did not meet her father again until the late 1930s, after she had become famous. In a 1938 interview published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;, Goddard claimed Le Vee was not her biological father. In response, Le Vee filed a suit against his daughter, claiming that the interview had ruined his reputation and cost him his job, and demanded financial support from her; Goddard admitted her loss in the case in a December 1945 interview with &quot;Life&quot;, and was forced to pay her father $35 a week.

Goddard began modeling after her parents&#x27; separation, working for Saks Fifth Avenue, Hattie Carnegie, and others. An important figure in her childhood was her mother&#x27;s paternal uncle Charles Goddard, the owner of the American Druggists Syndicate. He played a central role in Goddard&#x27;s career, introducing her to Broadway impresario Florenz Ziegfeld. In 1926, she made her stage debut as a dancer in Ziegfeld&#x27;s summer revue, &quot;No Foolin&quot;&#x27; under the stage name Paulette Goddard. Ziegfeld hired her for another musical, &quot;Rio Rita&quot;, which opened in February 1927, but she left the show after only three weeks to appear in the play &quot;The Unconquerable Male&quot;, produced by Archie Selwyn. However, it was a flop and closed after only three days following its premiere in Atlantic City. Soon after, Goddard was introduced to Edgar James, president of the Southern Lumber Company, located in Asheville, North Carolina, by Charles Goddard. Aged 17, considerably younger than James, she married him on June 28, 1927, in Rye, New York. It was a short marriage, and they separated in 1929; Goddard was granted a divorce in Reno, Nevada, in 1932, receiving a divorce settlement of $375,000.

==Film career==
Goddard first visited Hollywood in 1929. She appeared as an uncredited extra in two films, the Laurel and Hardy short film &quot;Berth Marks&quot; (1929) and George Fitzmaurice&#x27;s drama &quot;The Locked Door&quot; (1929). Following her divorce from James, Goddard and her mother briefly visited Europe before returning to Hollywood. Upon her return, Goddard signed her first film contract with producer Samuel Goldwyn to appear as a Goldwyn Girl in &quot;Whoopee!&quot; (1930). She also appeared in &quot;City Streets&quot; (1931), &quot;Ladies of the Big House&quot; (1931), and &quot;The Girl Habit&quot; (1931) for Paramount, &quot;Palmy Days&quot; (1931) for Goldwyn, and &quot;The Mouthpiece&quot; (1932) for Warners. However, Goddard and Goldwyn did not get along, and she also began work for Hal Roach Studios in 1932, appearing in a string of uncredited supporting roles for the next four years.

===1932–38: Charlie Chaplin and David Selznick===

The year she signed with Hal Roach, Goddard began dating Charlie Chaplin, a relationship that received substantial attention from the press. Chaplin sent her to local acting teacher Neely Dickson at the Hollywood Community Theater to, in Dickson&#x27;s words, &quot;give her a polish.&quot; It marked a turning point in Goddard&#x27;s career when Chaplin cast her as his leading lady in his next box office hit, &quot;Modern Times&quot; (1936). Her role as &quot;The Gamin,&quot; an orphan girl who runs away from the authorities and becomes The Tramp&#x27;s companion, was her first credited film appearance and garnered her mainly positive reviews, Frank S. Nugent of &quot;The New York Times&quot; describing her as &quot;the fitting recipient of the great Charlot&#x27;s championship&quot;.

Following the success of &quot;Modern Times,&quot; Chaplin planned other projects with Goddard in mind as a co-star. However, Chaplin worked on his projects slowly, and Goddard worried that the public might forget about her if she did not continue to make regular film appearances. She signed a contract with David O. Selznick and appeared with Janet Gaynor in the comedy &quot;The Young in Heart&quot; (1938). Selznick, who was pleased with Goddard&#x27;s performance in the film, strongly considered her for the role of Scarlett O&#x27;Hara in &quot;Gone With the Wind.&quot; Initial screen tests convinced Selznick and director George Cukor that Goddard would require coaching to be effective in the role, but that she showed the most promise. By December 1938, Selznick had narrowed the choices to Goddard and Vivien Leigh, who won the role after the two completed the only Technicolor screen tests for the role. Goddard&#x27;s losing out on the role was attributable to several factors. Notably, the head of Selznick&#x27;s publicity department Russell Birdwell had strong misgivings about Goddard, writing, &quot;Briefly, I think she is dynamite that will explode in our very faces if she is given the part.&quot; Chaplin&#x27;s biographer Joyce Milton wrote that Selznick also worried about legal issues by signing Goddard to a contract that might conflict with her pre-existing contracts with the Chaplin studio.

During this time, Selznick lent Goddard to MGM for two films: &quot;Dramatic School&quot; (1938) and the all-female ensemble &quot;The Women&quot; (1939). The first, with Luise Rainer, received mediocre reviews and failed to attract an audience. However, &quot;The Women&quot; – directed by Cukor following his firing from &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; – was one of the year&#x27;s most successful films. Of her role as Miriam Aarons, film critic Pauline Kael later wrote of Goddard, &quot;she is a stand-out. Fun.&quot;

===1939–49: Paramount===

In 1939, Goddard signed a contract with Paramount Pictures and was promptly teamed with comedian Bob Hope for the horror comedy film &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot; (1939). The film became a turning point for both their careers, and they were promptly reteamed for &quot;The Ghost Breakers&quot; (1940) and &quot;Nothing but the Truth&quot; (1941), both of which also featured Willie Best. She was also cast for the musical comedy &quot;Second Chorus&quot; opposite Fred Astaire, Artie Shaw, and future husband Burgess Meredith. Astaire later described it as &quot;the worst film I ever made&quot; while Shaw admitted the film made him reconsider an acting career. In September 1939, Chaplin also began production on his next film &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; (1940) in which Goddard again co-starred alongside him as Hannah. The film was released the following year to critical and audience acclaim. However, it would also be her final film with Chaplin, as their marriage fell apart soon after.

In 1940, Goddard made the Cecil B. DeMille Western film &quot;North West Mounted Police&quot; opposite Gary Cooper and Madeleine Carroll. The film, her first dramatic role for Paramount, became one of the year&#x27;s top-ten grossing films. She also starred in another musical comedy &quot;Pot o&#x27; Gold&quot; opposite James Stewart, which was released the following year. Stewart expressed similar feelings toward his film as Astaire, while Goddard&#x27;s biographer Julie Gilbert claimed Goddard did not like Stewart&#x27;s acting, reportedly saying &quot;anyone can gulp&quot;. Her other film for 1941, romantic drama &quot;Hold Back the Dawn&quot; with Charles Boyer and Olivia de Havilland, received positive reviews.

In 1942, Goddard gave one of her better-remembered film appearances in the variety musical &quot;Star Spangled Rhythm&quot;, in which she sang &quot;A Sweater, a Sarong, and a Peekaboo Bang&quot; with Dorothy Lamour and Veronica Lake. The studio also began to pair her with Ray Milland. Her first pairing with Milland, &quot;The Lady Has Plans&quot;, was panned by critics and had a tepid box office performance. However, she quickly reunited with him and DeMille for the adventure film &quot;Reap the Wild Wind&quot;. The film, which also co-starred John Wayne and Susan Hayward, saw Goddard in a Scarlett O&#x27;Hara-type role and became the studio&#x27;s best-grossing film for the year. Their third film, &quot;The Crystal Ball&quot;, was bought by United Artists – a studio co-founded by Chaplin – and released the following year to tepid box office receipts. That same year, Goddard headlined &quot;So Proudly We Hail!&quot; with Claudette Colbert and Veronica Lake. Her performance as Lt. Joan O&#x27;Doul, a nurse serving in the Battle of the Philippines, earned Goddard a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress at the 16th Academy Awards. She reteamed with her co-star in that film, Sonny Tufts, in &quot;I Love a Soldier&quot; the following year with less successful results.

In May 1944, Goddard renegotiated her contract with Paramount to make two films per year over a seven-year period. The first film under this deal, costume drama &quot;Kitty&quot;, reunited her with Milland. The film required Goddard to learn a cockney accent, for which she was coached by Connie Lupino, mother of actress Ida Lupino. The film was released the following year, becoming her most successful film for the studio. She also made a cameo as herself in the ensemble comedy &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot;, based on the popular radio show. Akin to &quot;Star Spangled Rhythm&quot;, the film featured several Paramount contract players in cameos as themselves. In 1946, she starred in &quot;The Diary of a Chambermaid&quot; opposite her husband Burgess Meredith; the couple also produced the film for United Artists. 

In 1947, she starred in two box office disasters: the historical epic &quot;Unconquered&quot;, which reunited her with Cooper and DeMille; and the comedy &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot;, which she made in Britain for Alexander Korda. Although one of the year&#x27;s highest-grossing films, &quot;Unconquered&quot; had a large budget – further inflated by going past its shooting schedule – that caused it to lose money for Paramount. The film&#x27;s story was also criticized, though Goddard and Cooper received positive reviews for their performances. During production of the film, Goddard and DeMille clashed on the set over Goddard&#x27;s reluctance to do a dangerous stunt. &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; suffered from behind-the-scenes difficulties that included a crew strike over Goddard using her personal, Swedish-born hairdresser over an English one. Besides for Britain, the film severely underperformed at the box office, being pulled in the United States with several other British films due to a boycott by the radical Zionist group Sons of Liberty over British policies in the Palestine Mandate. The following year, Goddard reunited with Meredith in a segment of the comedy film &quot;On Our Merry Way&quot;, which he also produced. However, that same year, Meredith was placed on the Hollywood blacklist after an investigation by the House Un-American Activities Committee (Chaplin would also later be added to the blacklist). Goddard was paired with MacDonald Carey in two films for Paramount, &quot;Hazard&quot; (1948) and &quot;Bride of Vengeance&quot; (1949); and was loaned to Columbia Pictures for the film noir &quot;Anna Lucasta&quot;. However, all three of the films lost money, and she left the studio in 1949.

===1950–58: Freelance and television===

After leaving Paramount and divorcing Meredith, Goddard headlined the Mexican-American film &quot;The Torch&quot; (1950), also serving as an associate producer. The following year, she made her television debut in an episode of &quot;Four Star Revue&quot;. Her roles in films such as film noir &quot;Vice Squad&quot; opposite Edward G. Robinson, and the biblical character Jezebel in &quot;Sins of Jezebel&quot; failed to attract the attention of her earlier work. Her last starring film role was in the film noir &quot;A Stranger Came Home&quot; in 1954, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; deemed &quot;A third-rate British-made whodunit,&quot; and said &quot;A few more fly-by-nights like this Lippert presentation... and the still-shapely Miss Goddard may find herself collecting the pieces of a career&quot;; That same year, Goddard guest starred as Lady Beryl on the second episode of &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Ronald Howard (son of Leslie Howard) as Holmes. She continued appearing in summer stock and on television, guest starring on episodes of &quot;Adventures in Paradise&quot;, &quot;The Errol Flynn Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Joseph Cotten Show&quot;, and &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot;.

==Later life==

In 1958, Goddard remarried for the final time to writer Erich Maria Remarque, who was twelve years her senior. Wealthy from shrewd investments, she largely retired from acting and moved with him to Ronco sopra Ascona, Switzerland, where she lived with Remarque in his villa Casa Monte Tabor. However, she did continue to act occasionally, appearing in the unsold television pilot &quot;The Phantom&quot;, a supporting role in the Italian film &quot;Time of Indifference&quot; (1964), and a small role in the pilot of &quot;The Snoop Sisters&quot;. Remarque died on September 25, 1970, from heart failure in Locarno.

In addition to her own wealth, Goddard inherited much of Remarque&#x27;s money and several important properties across Europe, including a wealth of contemporary art, which augmented her own long-standing collection. During this period, her talent at accumulating wealth became a byword among the old Hollywood elite. She also became a fairly well known and highly visible socialite in New York City, appearing covered with jewels at many high-profile cultural functions with several well-known men, including Andy Warhol, with whom she sustained a friendship for many years until his death in 1987. Goddard underwent invasive treatment for breast cancer in 1975, which by all accounts was successful.

==Personal life==

Goddard married the much older lumber tycoon Edgar James on June 28, 1927, when she was 17 years old; the couple moved to North Carolina. They separated two years later and divorced in January 1932.

In 1932, Goddard began a relationship with filmmaker Charlie Chaplin, and moved into his home in Beverly Hills. Aside from referring to Goddard as &quot;my wife&quot; at the October 1940 premiere of &quot;The Great Dictator&quot;, neither Goddard nor Chaplin publicly commented on their marital status during their time together. On June 3, 1942, Goddard filed for divorce in Mexico that was granted the following day. In his autobiography and her divorce filing, the couple claimed that they were married in June 1936 in Guangdong, China; while the couple did tour the area at this time, no record of a ceremony survives. However, Chaplin also reportedly told relatives that they were married only in common law. The two nonetheless maintained a friendly relationship following the divorce, and Goddard remained close with Chaplin&#x27;s two elder sons Charles Chaplin Jr. and Sydney Chaplin.

Goddard traveled to Mexico in 1940 for &quot;Look&quot; magazine (&quot;Paulette Goddard Discovers Mexico&quot;), where she met Diego Rivera while living in the San Angel Inn across from his studio. She was &quot;pursued&quot; by Rivera and was depicted holding hands with him in his Pan American Unity mural. She accompanied him to California when he fled Mexico following death threats and attacks on him for his political activities. A follow-up story in &quot;Look&quot; (July 20, 1940) was titled &quot;Adventure and Mexico – Paulette Goddard helps Diego Rivera.&quot; The FBI soon put her under surveillance to investigate her political opinions and activities.

In May 1944, Goddard married Burgess Meredith at David O. Selznick&#x27;s home in Beverly Hills. In October 1944, she suffered the miscarriage of a son; it was the only pregnancy of hers reported, and she had no biological children from any of her marriages. In the latter part of their marriage, Meredith was placed on the Hollywood blacklist. On the way to a premiere, the two were mobbed by a baying crowd screaming &quot;Communists!&quot;; Goddard was reported to have said &quot;Shall I roll down the window and hit them with my diamonds, Bugsy?&quot; They divorced in June 1949.

In February 1958, Goddard married writer Erich Maria Remarque. They remained married until Remarque&#x27;s death in 1970.

==Death and legacy==

On April 23, 1990, aged 79, Goddard died at her home in Switzerland from heart failure.

Arguably, Goddard&#x27;s foremost legacies remain her two feature films with Charles Chaplin — &quot;Modern Times&quot; and &quot;The Great Dictator&quot; — and a $20 million donation to New York University (NYU) in New York City to fund an institution devoted to European studies, named after Remarque. This contribution was also in recognition of her friendship with the Indiana-born politician and former NYU President John Brademas. Goddard Hall, a residence hall for NYU freshmen in Greenwich Village, is named in her honor.

===Fictional portrayals===
Goddard was portrayed by Gwen Humble in the made-for-TV movie &quot;&quot; (1980), by Diane Lane in the 1992 film &quot;Chaplin&quot;, and by Natalie Wilder in the 2011 play &quot;Puma&quot;, written by Julie Gilbert, who also wrote &quot;Opposite Attraction: The Lives of Erich Maria Remarque and Paulette Goddard&quot;.

<text>The 2003 Saskatchewan general election was held on November 5, 2003, to elect the 58 members of the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan (MLAs). The election was called on October 8 by Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan Lynda Haverstock, on the advice of Premier Lorne Calvert.

==Campaign==
Going into the election, the popularity of the New Democratic Party of Saskatchewan (NDP) had declined because of several controversies. Voters in this agrarian province were disgruntled because of a mediocre harvest, a disastrous summer for cattle producers — the American border had been closed to Canadian beef due to fears of mad cow disease; and the actions of a member of the NDP Cabinet who was found to have misled the people of the province on the nature of the Saskatchewan Potato Utility Development Company (&quot;SPUDCO&quot;) — a publicly owned potato company that was inappropriately characterized as a public-private partnership that went bust in 2000.

New Liberal leader David Karwacki was elected on a platform of disbanding the coalition with the NDP. After ordering Liberal MLAs to leave government, MLAs Ron Osika and Jim Melenchuk left the party and continued to sit in government before ultimately joining the NDP.

Election issues included emigration (the province&#x27;s population was falling because young people were leaving the province to look for work), honesty and integrity, privatization of public inter-city transit and energy supplies, and utility rates.

During the campaign, the NDP was attacked for an internal cartoon that had been leaked to the media. It depicted Saskatchewan Party leader Elwin Hermanson directing persons labeled &#x27;NDP sympathizers&#x27; onto railway boxcars. The cartoon referred to speculation that, if elected, Hermanson would replace civil servants who were NDP supporters with Saskatchewan Party supporters. However, many associated it with the Holocaust – in particular Nazi Germany&#x27;s deportation of Jews to concentration camps.

The campaign as a whole was seen as being quite negative, as the NDP constantly claimed that the Saskatchewan Party had a &#x27;secret agenda&#x27; to privatize crown corporations to finance large tax cuts for business; the Saskatchewan Party had a difficult time refuting these claims, as several party members made comments that seemed consistent with this view.

Unlike many of the other provincial elections held in 2003, the election was widely regarded as too close to call up until a large proportion of the polls had reported. To the surprise of observers who believed the NDP would be affected by the poor pre-election conditions, the NDP won its fourth term in government. It actually picked up the one seat it needed for a bare majority. The election was ultimately decided in Regina Wascana Plains, which the NDP won by only 543 votes. Had the Saskatchewan Party won here, both parties would have had 29 seats each. All of the NDP&#x27;s ministers were re-elected; except for two who had defected to the party from the Liberals.

The Saskatchewan Party cemented its grip on most of the rural seats, yet was unable to make further gains in urban areas. It won two additional seats in Saskatoon, but was completely shut out in Regina (though as mentioned above it nearly won Regina Wascana Plains). Believing he had taken the party as far as he could, Hermanson resigned as leader on November 18, 2003.

Although speculation was high that they could form the balance of power in the case of a minority government, the Liberals lost their one seat, shutting them out of the legislature for the first time since 1982. They would never again return to the legislature — in 2023 they re-branded as the Saskatchewan Progress Party.

<text>Zollinger–Ellison syndrome (Z-E syndrome) is a rare disease in which tumors cause the stomach to produce too much acid, resulting in peptic ulcers. Symptoms include abdominal pain and diarrhea.

The syndrome is caused by the formation of a gastrinoma, a neuroendocrine tumor that secretes a hormone called gastrin. High levels of gastrin in the blood (hypergastrinemia) trigger the parietal cells of the stomach to release excess gastric acid. The excess gastric acid causes peptic ulcer disease and distal ulcers. Gastrinomas most commonly arise in the duodenum, pancreas or stomach.

In 75% of cases, Zollinger–Ellison syndrome occurs sporadically, while the remaining 25% of cases are due to an autosomal dominant syndrome called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1).

==Signs and symptoms==
Patients with Zollinger–Ellison syndrome may experience abdominal pain and diarrhea. If left untreated, the condition could result in severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and refractory peptic ulcer disease. The diagnosis is also suspected in patients who have severe and recurrent ulceration of the stomach and small bowel, especially if they fail to respond to treatment.
* Chronic diarrhea, including steatorrhea (fatty stools)
* Pain in the esophagus, especially between and after meals at night
* Nausea
* Wheezing
* Vomiting blood
* Malnourishment
* Loss of appetite
* Malabsorption

Gastrinomas may occur as single tumors or as multiple small tumors. About one-half to two-thirds of single gastrinomas are malignant tumors that most commonly spread to the liver and to lymph nodes near the pancreas and small bowel.
Nearly 25 percent of patients with gastrinomas have multiple tumors as part of a condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1). MEN I patients have tumors in their pituitary gland and parathyroid glands, in addition to tumors of the pancreas.

==Pathophysiology==
Gastrin works on the parietal cells of the gastric glands, causing them to secrete more hydrogen ions into the stomach lumen. In addition, gastrin acts as a trophic factor for parietal cells, causing parietal cell hyperplasia. Normally, hydrogen ion secretion is controlled by a negative feedback loop by gastric cells to maintain a suitable pH, however, the neuroendocrine tumor that is present in individuals with Zollinger–Ellison Syndrome has no regulation, resulting in excessively large amounts of secretion. Thus, there is an increase in the number of acid-secreting cells, and each of these cells produces acid at a higher rate. The increase in acidity contributes to the development of peptic ulcers in the stomach, duodenum (first portion of the small bowel) and occasionally the jejunum (second portion of the small bowel), the last of which is an &#x27;atypical&#x27; ulcer.

==Diagnosis==
Zollinger–Ellison syndrome may be suspected when the above symptoms prove resistant to treatment when the symptoms are especially suggestive of the syndrome, or when endoscopy is suggestive. The diagnosis is made through several laboratory tests and imaging studies:
* Secretin stimulation test, which measures evoked gastrin levels. Note that the mechanism underlying this test is in contrast to the normal physiologic mechanism whereby secretin inhibits gastrin release from G cells. Gastrinoma cells release gastrin in response to secretin stimulation, thereby providing a sensitive means of differentiation.
* Fasting gastrin levels on at least three occasions
* Gastric acid secretion and pH (normal basal gastric acid secretion is less than 10 mEq/hour; in Zollinger–Ellison patients, it is usually more than 15 mEq/hour)
* An increased level of chromogranin A is a common marker of neuroendocrine tumors.

In addition, the source of the increased gastrin production must be determined using MRI or somatostatin receptor scintigraphy.

Diagnosis can sometimes be very difficult, especially considering patients who take a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medication for gastric reflux, which constitute a large and increasing proportion of people who develop Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. PPIs inadvertently increase gastrin production, which may cause a false positive for elevated gastrin levels. This can occur even in patients who have been off their medication for weeks, due to the long duration of effects of these medications.

==Treatment==
Proton pump inhibitors (such as omeprazole and lansoprazole) and histamine H2-receptor antagonists (such as famotidine and ranitidine) are used to slow acid secretion. Once gastric acid is suppressed, symptoms normally improve. Surgery to remove peptic ulcers or tumors might also be considered.

== Epidemiology ==
The condition most commonly affects people between the ages of 30 and 60. The prevalence is unknown, but estimated to be about 1 in 100,000 people.

==History==
Sporadic reports of unusual cases of peptic ulceration in the presence of pancreatic tumors occurred prior to 1955, but Robert M. Zollinger and Edwin H. Ellison, surgeons at Ohio State University, were the first to postulate a causal relationship between these findings. The American Surgical Association meeting in Philadelphia in April 1955 heard the first public description of the syndrome, and Zollinger and Ellison subsequently published their findings in &quot;Annals of Surgery&quot;.

<doc id="357817" wikidata="Q1047892" url="?curid=357817" title="Promiscuous mode">
<text>In computer networking, promiscuous mode is a mode for a wired network interface controller (NIC) or wireless network interface controller (WNIC) that causes the controller to pass all traffic it receives to the central processing unit (CPU) rather than passing only the frames that the controller is specifically programmed to receive. This mode is normally used for packet sniffing that takes place on a router or on a computer connected to a wired network or one being part of a wireless LAN. Interfaces are placed into promiscuous mode by software bridges often used with hardware virtualization.

In IEEE 802 networks such as Ethernet or IEEE 802.11, each frame includes a destination MAC address. In non-promiscuous mode, when a NIC receives a frame, it drops it unless the frame is addressed to that NIC&#x27;s MAC address or is a broadcast or multicast addressed frame. In promiscuous mode, however, the NIC allows all frames through, thus allowing the computer to read frames intended for other machines or network devices.

Many operating systems require superuser privileges to enable promiscuous mode. A non-routing node in promiscuous mode can generally only monitor traffic to and from other nodes within the same collision domain (for Ethernet and IEEE 802.11) or ring (for Token Ring). Computers attached to the same Ethernet hub satisfy this requirement, which is why network switches are used to combat malicious use of promiscuous mode. A router may monitor all traffic that it routes.

Promiscuous mode is often used to diagnose network connectivity issues. There are programs that make use of this feature to show the user all the data being transferred over the network. Some protocols like FTP and Telnet transfer data and passwords in clear text, without encryption, and network scanners can see this data. Therefore, computer users are encouraged to stay away from insecure protocols like telnet and use more secure ones such as SSH.

==Detection==
As promiscuous mode can be used in a malicious way to capture private data in transit on a network, computer security professionals might be interested in detecting network devices that are in promiscuous mode. In promiscuous mode, some software might send responses to frames even though they were addressed to another machine. However, experienced sniffers can prevent this (e.g., using carefully designed firewall settings). An example is sending a ping (ICMP echo request) with the wrong MAC address but the right IP address. If an adapter is operating in normal mode, it will drop this frame, and the IP stack never sees or responds to it. If the adapter is in promiscuous mode, the frame will be passed on, and the IP stack on the machine (to which a MAC address has no meaning) will respond as it would to any other ping. The sniffer can prevent this by configuring a firewall to block ICMP traffic.

<doc id="357820" wikidata="Q208521" url="?curid=357820" title="The Division Bell">
<text>The Division Bell is the fourteenth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released on 28 March 1994 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and on 5 April by Columbia Records in the United States.

The second Pink Floyd album recorded without the founding member Roger Waters, &quot;The Division Bell&quot; was written mostly by the guitarist and singer, David Gilmour, and the keyboardist, Richard Wright. It features Wright&#x27;s first lead vocal on a Pink Floyd album since &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973). Gilmour&#x27;s fiancée, the novelist Polly Samson, co-wrote many of the lyrics, which deal with themes of communication. It was the last Pink Floyd studio album to be composed of entirely new material, and the last recorded with Wright, who died in 2008.

Recording took place in locations including the band&#x27;s Britannia Row Studios and Gilmour&#x27;s houseboat, &quot;Astoria&quot;. The production team included longtime Pink Floyd collaborators such as the producer Bob Ezrin, the engineer Andy Jackson, the saxophonist Dick Parry and the bassist Guy Pratt.

&quot;The Division Bell&quot; received mixed reviews, but reached number one in more than 10 countries, including the UK and the US. In the US, it was certified double platinum in 1994 and triple platinum in 1999. Pink Floyd promoted it with a tour of the US and Europe; the tour sold more than 5 million tickets and made around $100 million in gross income. A live album and video, &quot;Pulse&quot;, was released in 1995. Unused material from the &quot;Division Bell&quot; sessions became part of Pink Floyd&#x27;s next album, &quot;The Endless River&quot; (2014).

==Recording==

In January 1993, guitarist David Gilmour, drummer Nick Mason and keyboardist Richard Wright began improvising new material in sessions at the remodelled Britannia Row Studios. They recruited bassist Guy Pratt, who had joined them on their Momentary Lapse of Reason Tour; according to Mason, Pratt&#x27;s playing influenced the mood of the music. Without the legal problems that had dogged the production of their 1987 album &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot;, Gilmour was at ease. If he felt the band were making progress, he would record them on a two-track DAT recorder. At one point, Gilmour surreptitiously recorded Wright playing, capturing material that formed the basis for three pieces of music.

After about two weeks, the band had around 65 pieces of music. With engineer Andy Jackson and co-producer Bob Ezrin, production moved to Gilmour&#x27;s houseboat and recording studio, &quot;Astoria&quot;. The band voted on each track, and whittled the material down to about 27 pieces. Eliminating some tracks, and merging others, they arrived at about 11 songs. Song selection was based upon a system of points, whereby all three members would award marks out of ten to each candidate song, a system skewed by Wright awarding his songs ten points each and the others none. Wright, having resigned under pressure from the bassist, Roger Waters, in 1979, was not contractually a full member of the band, which upset him. Wright reflected: &quot;It came very close to a point where I wasn&#x27;t going to do the album, because I didn&#x27;t feel that what we&#x27;d agreed was fair.&quot; Wright received his first songwriting credits on any Pink Floyd album since 1975&#x27;s &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;.

Gilmour&#x27;s fiancée, the novelist Polly Samson, also received songwriting credits. Initially, her role was limited to providing encouragement for Gilmour, but she helped him write &quot;High Hopes&quot;, a song about Gilmour&#x27;s childhood in Cambridge. She co-wrote a further six songs, which bothered Ezrin. Gilmour said that Samson&#x27;s contributions had &quot;ruffled the management&#x27;s [feathers]&quot;, but Ezrin later reflected that her presence had been inspirational for Gilmour, and that she &quot;pulled the whole album together&quot;. She also helped Gilmour with the cocaine addiction he had developed following his divorce. Samson did not want credit, saying &quot;the idea of my name being attached to Pink Floyd was like some nightmare&quot;, but Gilmour insisted, telling her she would regret going uncredited. She later said he was right, and that she had become used to him singing her lyrics.

The keyboardist Jon Carin, the percussionist Gary Wallis, backing vocalists including Sam Brown and the &quot;Momentary Lapse&quot; tour singer Durga McBroom were brought in before recording began. The band moved to Olympic Studios and recorded most of the tracks over the space of a week. After a summer break, they returned to &quot;Astoria&quot; to record more backing tracks. Ezrin worked on the drum sounds, and the Pink Floyd collaborator Michael Kamen provided the string arrangements, which were recorded at Abbey Road Studio Two by Steve McLaughlin. Dick Parry played saxophone on his first Pink Floyd album for almost 20 years, on &quot;Wearing the Inside Out&quot;, and Chris Thomas created the final mix. 

With the aid of Gilmour&#x27;s guitar technician, Phil Taylor, Carin located some of Pink Floyd&#x27;s older keyboards from storage, including a Farfisa organ. Sounds sampled from these instruments were used on &quot;Take It Back&quot; and &quot;Marooned&quot;. Additional keyboards were played by Carin, along with Bob Ezrin. Durga McBroom supplied backing vocals alongside Sam Brown, Carol Kenyon, Jackie Sheridan, and Rebecca Leigh-White. &quot;What Do You Want from Me&quot; was influenced by Chicago blues, and &quot;Poles Apart&quot; contains folksy overtones. Gilmour&#x27;s improvised guitar solos on &quot;Marooned&quot; used a DigiTech Whammy pedal to pitch-shift the guitar notes over an octave. On &quot;Take It Back&quot;, he used a Gibson J-200 guitar through a Zoom effects unit, played with an EBow, an electronic device which produces sounds similar to a bow.

Between September and December recording and mixing sessions were held at Metropolis Studios in Chiswick and the Creek Recording Studios in London. In September, Pink Floyd performed at a celebrity charity concert at Cowdray House, in Midhurst. The album was mastered at the Mastering Lab in Los Angeles, by Doug Sax and James Guthrie.

Jackson edited unused material from the &quot;Division Bell &quot;sessions, described by Mason as ambient music, into an hour-long composition tentatively titled &quot;The Big Spliff,&quot; but Pink Floyd did not release it. Some of &quot;The Big Spliff&quot; was used to create the next Pink Floyd album, &quot;The Endless River&quot; (2014).

==Themes==
&quot;The Division Bell&quot; deals with themes of communication and the idea that talking can solve many problems. &quot;In the Studio&quot; radio host Redbeard suggested that the album offers &quot;the very real possibility of transcending it all, through shivering moments of grace&quot;. Songs such as &quot;Poles Apart&quot; and &quot;Lost for Words&quot; have been interpreted by fans and critics as references to the estrangement between Pink Floyd and their former member Roger Waters, who left in 1985, however Gilmour denied this and said: &quot;People can invent and relate to a song in their personal ways but it&#x27;s a little late at this point for us to be conjuring Roger up.&quot; The title refers to the division bell rung in the British parliament to announce a vote. Mason said: &quot;It&#x27;s about people making choices, yeas or nays.&quot;

Produced a few years after the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, &quot;A Great Day for Freedom&quot; juxtaposes the general euphoria of the fall of the Berlin Wall with the subsequent wars and ethnic cleansing, particularly in the former Yugoslavia. Audio samples of Stephen Hawking, originally recorded for a BT television advertisement, were used in &quot;Keep Talking&quot;; Gilmour was so moved by Hawking&#x27;s sentiment in the advert that he contacted the advertising company for permission to use the recordings. Mason said it felt &quot;politically incorrect to take ideas from advertising but it seemed a very relevant piece&quot;. At the end of the album, Gilmour&#x27;s stepson Charlie is heard hanging up the telephone receiver on Pink Floyd manager Steve O&#x27;Rourke, who had pleaded to be allowed to appear on a Pink Floyd album.

==Title and packaging==

To avoid competing against other album releases, as had happened with &quot;A Momentary Lapse,&quot; Pink Floyd set a deadline of April 1994, at which point they would begin a new tour. By January of that year, however, the band still had not decided on an album title. Titles considered included &quot;Pow Wow&quot; and &quot;Down to Earth&quot;. At a dinner one night, writer Douglas Adams, spurred by the promise of a payment to his favourite charity, the Environmental Investigation Agency, suggested &quot;The Division Bell&quot;, a term which appears in &quot;High Hopes&quot;.

Pink Floyd&#x27;s longtime collaborator Storm Thorgerson created the album artwork. He erected two large metal heads, each the height of a double-decker bus, in a field near Stuntney, Cambridgeshire. The sculptures were positioned together and photographed in profile, and can be seen as two faces talking to each other or as a single, third face. Thorgerson said the &quot;third absent face&quot; was a reference to Syd Barrett. The sculptures were devised by Keith Breeden, and constructed by John Robertson. Ely Cathedral is visible on the horizon. The pictures were shot in February for optimal lighting conditions. In 2001, the sculptures were in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. In 2017, they were moved to the London Victoria and Albert Museum for display in a Pink Floyd exhibition. An alternate version of the cover photo, featuring two stone sculptures by Aden Hynes, was used on the compact cassette release and the tour brochure.

==Release and promotion==
On 10 January 1994 a press reception to announce &quot;The Division Bell&quot; and the tour was held at a former US Naval Air Station in North Carolina, in the US. A purpose-built Skyship 600 airship, manufactured in the UK, toured the US until it returned to Weeksville, and was destroyed by a thunderstorm on 27 June. Pieces of the aircraft were sold as souvenirs. The band held another reception, in the UK, on 21 March. This time they used an A60 airship, translucent, and painted to look like a fish, which took journalists on a tour of London. The airship, which was lit internally so it glowed in the night sky, was also flown in northern Europe.

During the &quot;Division Bell&quot; tour, an anonymous person using the name Publius posted on an internet newsgroup, inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the album. The message was verified during a show in East Rutherford, where lights in front of the stage spelled &quot;Enigma Publius&quot;. During a televised concert at Earls Court, London, in October 1994, the word &quot;enigma&quot; was projected in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. The riddle has never been solved. Gilmour and Mason later said it was created as a marketing ploy by EMI. According to Mason, the prize was to be &quot;a crop of trees planted in a clear-cut area of forest or something to that effect ... a touchy-feely sort of gift that was more of a philanthropic thing than something you could hang on the wall&quot;.

== Sales ==
&quot;The Division Bell&quot; was released in the UK by EMI Records on 28 March 1994, and in the US on 5 April, and went straight to number one in both countries. &quot;The Division Bell&quot; was certified silver and gold in the UK on 1 April 1994, platinum a month later and 2× platinum on 1 October. In the US, it was certified gold and double platinum on 6 June 1994, and triple platinum on 29 January 1999.

In the United States the album debuted at number one in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 during the week of 23 April 1994 selling more than 460,000 units, at the time it was the 12th largest single-week total since &quot;Billboard&quot; began using SoundScan data in May 1991 and also became the fifth-largest first-week sales sum back then. The next week it stayed at the top of the chart selling a little less than half its first-week total, it moved 226,000 units during its second week on chart. The next week sales slid by 30% from last week&#x27;s sum selling 157,000 units, despite this sales decrease the album stayed at number one. The following week, on 14 May 1994 &quot;The Division Bell&quot; remained at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sales declined by 17%. In its fifth week, it fell off to the fourth place on the chart. It was present on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for 53 weeks. It was certified three times platinum by the RIAA on 29 January 1999 for shipments of three million units.

==Tour==
Two days after the album&#x27;s release, the Division Bell Tour began at Joe Robbie Stadium, in suburban Miami. The set list began with 1967&#x27;s &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot;, before moving to tracks from 1987&#x27;s &quot;A Momentary Lapse of Reason&quot;, and &quot;The Division Bell&quot;. Songs from &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and &quot;The Wall&quot; were featured, as well as the whole &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. Backing musicians included Sam Brown, Jon Carin, Claudia Fontaine, Durga McBroom, Dick Parry, Guy Pratt, Tim Renwick, and Gary Wallis. 

The tour continued in the US through April, May and mid-June, before moving to Canada, and then returning to the US in July. As the tour reached Europe in late July, Waters declined an invitation to join the band, and later expressed his annoyance that Pink Floyd songs were being performed again in large venues. On the first night of the UK leg of the tour on 12 October, a 1,200-capacity stand collapsed, but with no serious injuries; the performance was rescheduled.

The tour ended at Earls Court on 29 October 1994, and was Pink Floyd&#x27;s final concert performance until Live 8 in 2005. Estimates placed the total number of tickets sold at over 5.3 million, and gross income at about $100 million. A live album and video, &quot;Pulse&quot;, was released in June 1995.

== Critical reception ==
Though regarded by long-time Pink Floyd fans as a return to form, &quot;The Division Bell&quot; received mixed reviews from music critics. Tom Sinclair of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;avarice is the only conceivable explanation for this glib, vacuous cipher of an album, which is notable primarily for its stomach-turning merger of progressive-rock pomposity and New Age noodling&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Tom Graves criticised Gilmour&#x27;s performance, writing that his guitar solos had &quot;settled into rambling, indistinct asides that are as forgettable as they used to be indelible ... Only on &#x27;What Do You Want from Me&#x27; does Gilmour sound like he cares&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; dismissed &quot;The Division Bell&quot; as a &quot;dud.&quot;

Among British reviewers, David Bennun of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; praised the opening instrumental &quot;Cluster One&quot; as &quot;magnificent&quot; and &quot;a track to rank with the most fragrant of modern ambient&quot;, but found the rest of the album dreary, despite finding &quot;hints&quot; throughout that Gilmour understood the band&#x27;s strengths. In his review for &quot;NME&quot;, Tommy Udo similarly praised &quot;Cluster One&quot; for sounding &quot;effortless&quot;, despite finding its ambient nature dated and unconnected to &quot;ambient upstarts&quot; the Orb. However, while Udo enjoyed &quot;The Division Bell&quot;″s lengthy instrumentals, he criticised the record overall for its &quot;sixth-form&quot; lyrics and for being &quot;so damned anonymous.&quot;

The album won the Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance on &quot;Marooned&quot;. &quot;The Division Bell&quot; was nominated for the 1995 Brit Award for Best Album by a British Artist, but lost to Blur&#x27;s &quot;Parklife&quot;.

In 2011, &quot;The Division Bell&quot; was ranked at number 93 in &quot;Q&quot;″s readers poll of the &quot;250 Best Albums of the Last 25 Years&quot;; the magazine wrote that the record &quot;reconfigured the magisterial prog-rock of the mid-&#x27;70s for the late-20th century&quot; and made for a welcome &quot;lap of honour&quot;. In &quot;Uncut&quot;&#x27;s 2011 &quot;Pink Floyd: The Ultimate Music Guide&quot;, Graeme Thomson wrote that &quot;The Division Bell &quot; &quot;might just be the dark horse of the Floyd canon. The opening triptych of songs is a hugely impressive return to something very close to the eternal essence of Pink Floyd, and much of the rest retains a quiet power and a meditative quality that betrays a genuine sense of unity.&quot; In 2014, &quot;Uncut&quot; reviewed the album again for its 20th-anniversary reissue, and praised its production, writing that it sounded much &quot;more like a classic Pink Floyd album&quot; than &quot;The Final Cut&quot; (1983) and that the connection between Wright and Gilmour was &quot;the album&#x27;s musical heart&quot;. Waters, who left Pink Floyd in 1985, dismissed &quot;The Division Bell&quot; as &quot;just rubbish ... nonsense from beginning to end.&quot;

== Reissues ==
&quot;The Division Bell&quot; was reissued in 2011. It was remastered by Andy Jackson and released as a standalone CD and as part of the &quot;Discovery&quot; box set. 

It was reissued again on 30 June 2014, as a &quot;20th anniversary deluxe edition&quot; box set and a 20th anniversary double-LP vinyl reissue. The instrumental piece &quot;Marooned&quot; served as the set&#x27;s lead single with a new video filmed at Pripyat. The box set contains the 2011 remaster of the album; a 5.1 surround sound remix by Jackson; 2-LP record on 180g vinyl; a red 7&quot; &quot;Take It Back&quot; single; a clear 7&quot; &quot;High Hopes/Keep Talking&quot; single; a blue, laser-etched 12&quot; &quot;High Hopes&quot; single; book and assorted art cards. The 2014 reissues saw the first release of the full album on vinyl as the 1994 vinyl release saw only edited versions of the songs to keep it to a single LP. &quot;The Division Bell&quot; was reissued again with the Pink Floyd Records label on 26 August 2016. A limited-edition 25th anniversary double-LP was released on 7 June 2019. The reissue is on blue vinyl and uses the two-LP master created for the 20th anniversary vinyl release.

<text>Multimedia Home Platform (DVB-MHP) is an open middleware system standard designed by the DVB project for interactive digital television. The MHP enables the reception and execution of interactive, Java-based applications on a TV set. Interactive TV applications can be delivered over the broadcast channel, together with audio and video streams. These applications can be for example information services, games, interactive voting, e-mail, SMS or shopping. MHP applications can use an additional return channel that has to support IP.

== Deployment ==
In May 2010 the largest deployments DVB-MHP are in Italy (DVB-T), Korea (DVB-S), Belgium (DVB-C) and Poland (DVB-S) with trials or small deployments in Germany, Spain, Austria, Colombia, Uruguay and Australia.

MHP service was also offered in Finland by Finnish Broadcasting Corporation (Yleisradio), but the service was shut down at the end of 2007 after technical failure. The shutdown wasn&#x27;t ever officially announced. Ultimately the reason for the shutdown was that MHP never gained &quot;critical mass&quot;. The main reasons for its lack of success in Finland were: 1) 50% of the Finnish households use the terrestrial network, where broadcasting of MHP applications can be really expensive, 2) TV broadcasters never told TV viewers about the MHP services—because the digitalization of the TV networks got extremely negative publicity in Finnish media, the broadcasters didn&#x27;t want to upset their customers further if they had bought new expensive STBs which weren&#x27;t capable of playing MHP apps, and 3) there were only a few MHP set-top boxes in the market—because Finland is such a small market, big manufacturers weren&#x27;t interested in developing new MHP boxes just for Finland. MHP-capable STBs are no longer available in Finland.

The U.S. cable industry has specified its own middleware system referred as OCAP, which is largely based on MHP.
Currently, Belgium&#x27;s largest cable provider Telenet is rolling out their DVB-MHP system, called DigiBox. Norway&#x27;s upcoming terrestrial digital TV network NTV will also use the DVB-MHP standard. In late 2008 the Info+ channel in Greece (part of the ERT Digital platform) started broadcasting DVB-MHP info, however since standards have not been set as of February 2009 for digital television in Greece, most TV sets and DVB-T receivers sold in the country do not feature DVB-MHP.

== Technology ==

The MHP specifies an extensive application execution environment for digital interactive TV, independent of the underlying, vendor-specific, hardware and software. This execution environment is based on the use of a Java virtual machine and the definition of generic APIs that provide access to the interactive digital TV terminal&#x27;s typical resources and facilities. The interoperable MHP applications are running on top of these APIs. A so-called Navigator-application, which is part of the terminal software, allows the user the access to all MHP applications and other DVB services (like TV and radio). Sometimes Navigator can be also a Java program itself but that is not a requirement.

The MHP is just a part of a family of specifications, which all base on the Globally Executable MHP (GEM)-Standard, which was defined to allow the worldwide adoption of MHP.

== DVB-HTML ==

MHP applications come in two flavours. The first type are DVB-HTML applications. These are not very popular, partly because the specification for DVB-HTML was only completed with MHP 1.1, and partly because many broadcasters, box manufacturers and content developers find it too complex and difficult to implement. DVB-HTML applications are a set of HTML pages that are broadcast as part of a service. The spec is based around a modularized version of XHTML 1.1, and also includes CSS 2.0, DOM 2.0, and ECMAScript.

== DVB-J ==
The second, and by far the most popular flavour is DVB-J (DVB-Java) applications. These are written in Java using the MHP API set and consist of a set of class files that are broadcast with a service. DVB-Java applications are known as &quot;Xlets&quot;. These are a concept similar to applets for Web pages that has been introduced by Sun in the JavaTV specification. Like applets, the xlet interface allows an external source (the application manager in the case of an MHP receiver) to start and stop an application.

== Return channel ==
The MHP set-top boxes may provide a backchannel for applications that wish to communicate with the outside world, for example a voting or shopping application. Typical upstream backchannels are phone line or broadband Internet connection (ADSL, or 56k in Italy, using a modem included in the set-top box). DVB-RCT (Return Channel Terrestrial) is a wireless technology utilizing the DVB infrastructure. It provides a VHF/UHF Wireless Return Channel back to the broadcaster for Interactive Terrestrial TV. It provides a data-rate of several kbit/s per user, for voting, polls, email, teleshopping, etc. If return channel is present it should provide IP with TLS support.

<text>Joseba Beloki Dorronsoro (born 12 August 1973) is a Spanish Basque former professional road bicycle racer.

== Tour successes ==
Beloki turned professional in 1998 with , joined in 2000, and then in 2001. A strong climber in the high mountains and a top performer in individual time trials, he made it to the podium in each of his first three rides in the Tour de France: in 2000 (3rd place), 2001 (3rd place) and 2002 (2nd place). He is the only runner-up during Lance Armstrong&#x27;s run of seven consecutive Tour wins to have not been found guilty of doping, though he was not retroactively awarded the victory in the general classification of 2002 after Armstrong&#x27;s wins were stripped. In 2001, Beloki also finished first overall in the Volta a Catalunya.

==Crash and recovery==

On 14 July 2003, during the 9th stage of the 2003 Tour de France, Beloki was in second place overall (just 40 seconds behind Armstrong) and negotiating a turn at speed while descending from Cote de La Rochette, shortly after passing the Col de Manse, just 4 km from the stage finish at Gap. He lost control of his bicycle after he locked his rear brake and the rear tire came off the wheel on a patch of tarmac that was softened by the sun, sending his rear wheel skidding first in one direction and then the other. Beloki suffered a hard fall that broke his right femur in two places along with his elbow and his wrist. Armstrong was following immediately behind Beloki and, to avoid the fallen rider, headed off the road to go down the hill through the underbrush and across a small field. The crash effectively ended Beloki&#x27;s career as a premier bicycle racer.

For the 2004 season, Beloki opted to sign for the French team Brioches La Boulangère in preparation for the 2004 Tour de France. He was reported as being fully recovered from his injuries by early 2004, but it later transpired that those injuries were taking longer to heal than initially anticipated. By mid-April 2004, Beloki had yet to begin serious competition for the season. He started his home race, the Tour of the Basque Country, but failed to even complete the first stage before retiring in pain from his injuries. Citing incompatibility with the French team, he switched to the Spanish Saunier Duval–Prodir team for the remainder of the 2004 season. Beloki switched back to Manolo Saiz&#x27;s team (now called Liberty Seguros–Würth) for 2005. Beloki completed the 2005 Tour de France and finished in 75th place. In the Vuelta a España, he also completed the race without being recognized, since he was only 39th overall.

In 2006 he was among those implicated in Operación Puerto and was withdrawn from the Tour de France. However, on 26 July he was cleared by Spanish officials of any wrongdoing. Payment records from Beloki as well as his race schedule were found in Eufemiano Fuentes&#x27; possession in his office; however, Beloki denies any claim he doped with Fuentes.

==Personal life==
His son Markel Beloki is also a professional cyclist.

<doc id="357826" wikidata="Q318054" url="?curid=357826" title="Joseph Needham">
<text>Noel Joseph Terence Montgomery Needham (; 9 December 1900 – 24 March 1995) was a British biochemist, historian of science and sinologist known for his scientific research and writing on the history of Chinese science and technology, initiating publication of the multivolume &quot;Science and Civilisation in China&quot;. A focus of his was what has come to be called [[Joseph Needham|the Needham Question]] of why and how China had ceded its leadership in science and technology to Western countries.

He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1941 and a fellow of the British Academy in 1971. In 1992, Queen Elizabeth II conferred on him the Order of the Companions of Honour, and the Royal Society noted he was the only living person to hold these three titles.

==Early life==
Needham&#x27;s father, Joseph, was a doctor, and his mother, Alicia Adelaïde, née Montgomery (1863–1945), was a music composer from Oldcastle, County Meath, Ireland. His father, born in East London, then a poor section of town, rose to become a Harley Street physician, but frequently battled with Needham&#x27;s mother. The young Needham often mediated. In his early teens, he was taken to hear the Sunday lectures of Ernest Barnes, a professional mathematician who became Master of the Temple, a royal church in London. Barnes inspired an interest in the philosophers and medieval scholastics that Needham pursued in his father&#x27;s library. Needham later attributed his strong Christian faith to Barnes&#x27; philosophical theology, which was founded on rational argument, and attributed his openness to the religions of other cultures to Barnes as well.

In 1914, with the outbreak of World War I, Needham was sent to Oundle School, founded in 1556 in Northamptonshire. He did not enjoy leaving home, but he later described the headmaster Frederick William Sanderson as a &quot;man of genius&quot; and said that without that influence on him at a tender age, he might not have attempted his largest work. Sanderson had been charged by the school&#x27;s governors with developing a science and technology programme, which included a metal shop that gave the young Needham a grounding in engineering. Sanderson also emphasised to the boys of the school that co-operation led to higher human achievement than competition and that knowledge of history was necessary to build a better future. The Bible, in Sanderson&#x27;s teaching, supplied archaeological knowledge to compare with the present. During school holidays, Needham assisted his father in the operating rooms of several wartime hospitals, an experience that convinced him that he was not interested in becoming a surgeon. The Royal Navy, however, appointed him a surgeon sub-lieutenant, a position that he held for only a few months.

== Education ==
In 1921, Needham graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. 
In January 1925, Needham earned an MA. In October 1925, Needham earned a PhD. He had intended to study medicine, but came under the influence of Frederick Hopkins, resulting in his switch to biochemistry.

== Career ==
After graduation, Needham was elected to a fellowship at Gonville and Caius College and worked in Gowland Hopkins&#x27; laboratory at the University Department of Biochemistry, specialising in embryology and morphogenesis. His three-volume work &quot;Chemical Embryology&quot;, published in 1931, includes a history of embryology from Egyptian times up to the early 19th century, including quotations in most European languages. Including this history reflected Needham&#x27;s fear that overspecialization would hold back scientific progress and that social and historical forces shaped science. At that time Cambridge school of biochemistry were recognised for imaginative exploratory science and had outstanding scientists Hopkins, Dorothy M. Needham (later his wife)Robin Hill, Barcroft who were joined by Rudi Lemberg on a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship.

In 1936, he and several other Cambridge scientists founded the History of Science Committee. The Committee included conservatives but also Marxists like J.D. Bernal, whose views on the social and economic frameworks of science influence Needham. 

Needham&#x27;s Terry Lecture of 1936 was published by Cambridge University Press in association with Yale University Press under the title of &quot;Order and Life&quot;. In 1939 he produced a massive work on morphogenesis that a Harvard reviewer claimed &quot;will go down in the history of science as Joseph Needham&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus,&quot;&quot; little knowing what would come later.

Although his career as biochemist and an academic was well established, his career developed in unanticipated directions with World War II with his evident interest in history. In 1939, Needham referred to his thesis that &quot;man&#x27;s intellectual progress cannot be understood save in the light of his social progress&quot; illustrated by the historical period which saw the re-birth of experimental science in Europe and in England at the end of the seventeenth century. He was writing the foreword, with &quot;particular pleasure&quot;, to the little book of my friend on the Levellers. Needham wrote: &quot;Merton has shown how puritan were the early Fellows of the Royal Society.&quot; And goes on to acknowledge Holorenshaw in pointing out: &quot;that no less than the men of property, the Levellers realised the social importance of science, and foresaw the part it would one day play in human welfare.&quot; 

Three Chinese scientists came to Cambridge for graduate study in 1937: Lu Gwei-djen, Wang Ying-lai, and Shen Shih-Chang (, the only one under Needham&#x27;s tutelage). Lu, daughter of a Nanjing pharmacist, taught Needham Chinese, igniting his interest in China&#x27;s ancient technological and scientific past. He then pursued, and mastered, the study of Classical Chinese privately with Gustav Haloun.
Under the Royal Society&#x27;s direction, Needham was the director of the Sino-British Science Co-operation Office in Chongqing from 1942 to 1946. During this time he made several long journeys through war-torn China and many smaller ones, visiting scientific and educational establishments and obtaining for them much needed supplies. His longest trip in late 1943 ended in far west in Gansu at the caves in Dunhuang at the end of the Great Wall where the earliest dated printed book - a copy of the Diamond Sutra - was found. The other long trip reached Fuzhou on the east coast, returning across the Xiang River just two days before the Japanese blew up the bridge at Hengyang and cut off that part of China. In 1944 he visited Yunnan in an attempt to reach the Burmese border. Everywhere he went he purchased and was given old historical and scientific books which he shipped back to Britain through diplomatic channels. They were to form the foundation of his later research. He got to know Zhou Enlai, first Premier of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and met numerous Chinese scholars, including the painter Wu Zuoren, and the meteorologist Zhu Kezhen, who later sent crates of books to him in Cambridge, including 2,000 volumes of the &quot;Gujin Tushu Jicheng&quot; encyclopaedia, a comprehensive record of China&#x27;s past.

On his return to Europe, he was asked by Julian Huxley to become the first head of the Natural Sciences Section of UNESCO in Paris, France. In fact it was Needham who insisted that science should be included in the organisation&#x27;s mandate at an earlier planning meeting.

After two years in which the suspicions of the Americans over scientific co-operation with communists intensified, Needham resigned in 1948 and returned to Gonville and Caius College, where he resumed his fellowship and his rooms, which were soon filled with his books.

He devoted his energy to the history of Chinese science until his retirement in 1990, even though he continued to teach some biochemistry until 1993. Needham&#x27;s reputation recovered from the Korean affair (see below) such that by 1959 he was elected as president of the fellows of Caius College and in 1965 he became Master (head) of the college, a post which he held until he was 76.

=== &quot;Science and Civilisation in China&quot; ===

In 1948, Needham proposed a project to the Cambridge University Press for a book on &quot;Science and Civilisation in China&quot;. Within weeks of being accepted, the project had grown to seven volumes, and it has expanded ever since. His initial collaborator was the historian Wang Ling, whom he had met in Lizhuang and obtained a position for at Trinity. The first years were devoted to compiling a list of every mechanical invention and abstract idea that had been made and conceived in China. These included cast iron, the ploughshare, the stirrup, gunpowder, printing, the magnetic compass and clockwork escapements, most of which were thought at the time to be western inventions. The first volume eventually appeared in 1954.

The publication received widespread acclaim, which intensified to lyricism as the further volumes appeared. He wrote fifteen volumes himself, and the regular production of further volumes continued after his death in 1995. Later, Volume III was divided, so that 27 volumes have now been published. Successive volumes are published as they are completed, which means that they do not appear in the order originally contemplated in the project&#x27;s prospectus.

Needham&#x27;s final organizing schema was:
* Vol. I. &quot;Introductory Orientations&quot;
* Vol. II. &quot;History of Scientific Thought&quot;
* Vol. III. &quot;Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and Earth&quot;
* Vol. IV. &quot;Physics and Physical Technology&quot;
* Vol. V. &quot;Chemistry and Chemical Technology&quot;
* Vol. VI. &quot;Biology and Biological Technology&quot;
* Vol. VII. &quot;The Social Background&quot;
See &quot;Science and Civilisation in China&quot; for a full list.

The project is still proceeding under the guidance of the Publications Board of the Needham Research Institute, directed by Professor Mei Jianjun.

=== UNESCO ===

Needham, along with colleague Julian Huxley, was one of the founders of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Developed in 1945 with the help of Allied governments, UNESCO is an international organization that aims to bring education to regions that had been affected by Nazi occupation. Needham and Huxley advocated the growth of scientific education as a means to overcome political conflict and hence founded UNESCO in an effort to expand its influence. Composed of representatives from various Allied countries, UNESCO operated on the principle that ideas and information should spread freely among nations. However, Needham disagreed with this initial mode of exchange because of its failure to include nations outside of Europe and America.

To communicate his discordance with the model, Needham wrote and distributed a formal message to others in the organization explaining its flaws. He stated that nations outside of the European-American &quot;bright zone&quot;, or primary location of scientific advancement, needed the help of international education the most. He also argued that the lack of familiarity between other nations and those in the bright zone made ideological exchange difficult. Finally, he expressed the notion that other countries had issues disseminating knowledge because they lacked the capital necessary for distribution. Due to these constraints, Needham suggested that most of the organization&#x27;s support should be given to the &quot;periphery&quot; nations that lie outside of the bright zone.

In addition to supporting periphery nations, Needham incorporated his desire for a non-Eurocentric record of science in UNESCO&#x27;s mission. To this end, Huxley and Needham devised an ambitious scholarly project they called &quot;The History of Scientific and Cultural Development of Mankind&quot; (shortened to &quot;History of Mankind&quot;)&quot;.&quot; The goal of this project was to write a non-ethnocentric account of scientific and cultural history; it aimed to synthesize the contributions, perspectives, and development of oriental nations in the East in a way that was complementary to the Western scientific tradition. This vision was partly influenced by the political climate of the time of its planning in the late 1940s - the &quot;East&quot; and &quot;West&quot; were seen as cultural and political opposites. Working from the belief that science was the universal experience that bound humanity, Huxley and Needham hoped that their project would help ease some of the animosity between the two spheres. The project involved hundreds of scholars from around the globe and took over a decade to reach fruition in 1966. The work is still continued today with new volumes published periodically.

=== The Needham Question ===
&quot;Needham&#x27;s Grand Question&quot;, also known as &quot;The Needham Question&quot;, is this: why had China been overtaken by the West in science and technology, despite their earlier successes? In Needham&#x27;s words,

&quot;Why did modern science, the mathematization of hypotheses about Nature, with all its implications for advanced technology, take its meteoric rise only in the West at the time of Galileo?&quot;, and why it &quot;had not developed in Chinese civilization&quot; which, in the previous many centuries &quot;was much more efficient than occidental in applying&quot; natural knowledge to practical needs.

Francis Bacon considered four inventions as completely transforming the modern world, marking it off from the antiquity of the Middle Ages: paper and printing, gunpowder, and the magnetic compass. He regarded the origins of these inventions as &#x27;obscure and inglorious&#x27;, dying without ever knowing that all of them were Chinese. Part of Needham&#x27;s work attempts to &quot;put this record straight&quot;.

Needham&#x27;s works attribute significant weight to the impact of Confucianism and Taoism on the pace of Chinese scientific discovery, and emphasises the &quot;diffusionist&quot; approach of Chinese science as opposed to a perceived independent inventiveness in the western world.
Needham thought the notion that the Chinese script had inhibited scientific thought was &quot;grossly overrated&quot;.

His own research revealed a steady accumulation of scientific results throughout Chinese history. In the final volume he suggests &quot;A continuing general and scientific progress manifested itself in traditional Chinese society but this was violently overtaken by the exponential growth of modern science after the Renaissance in Europe. China was homeostatic, but never stagnant.&quot;

Nathan Sivin, one of Needham&#x27;s collaborators, while agreeing that Needham&#x27;s achievement was monumental, suggested that the &quot;Needham question&quot;, as a counterfactual hypothesis, was not conducive to a useful answer:
There are several hypotheses attempting to explain the Needham Question. Yingqiu Liu and Chunjiang Liu argued that the issue rested on the lack of property rights and that those rights were only obtainable through favour of the emperor. Protection was incomplete as the emperor could rescind those rights at any time. Science and technology were subjugated to the needs of the feudal royal family, and any new discoveries were sequestered by the government for its use. The government took steps to control and interfere with private enterprises by manipulating prices and engaging in bribery. Each revolution in China redistributed property rights under the same feudal system. Land and property were reallocated first and foremost to the royal family of the new dynasty up until the late Qing Dynasty (1644–1911) when fiefdom land was taken over by warlords and merchants. These limited property rights constrained potential scientific innovations.

The Chinese Empire enacted totalitarian control and was able to do so because of its great size. There were smaller independent states that had no choice but to comply with this control. They could not afford to isolate themselves. The Chinese believed in the well-being of the state as their primary motive for economic activity, and individual initiatives were shunned. There were regulations on the press, clothing, construction, music, birth rates, and trade. The Chinese state controlled all aspects of life, severely limiting any incentives to innovate and to better one&#x27;s self. &quot;The ingenuity and inventiveness of the Chinese would no doubt have enriched China further and probably brought it to the threshold of modern industry, had it not been for this stifling state control. It is the State that kills technological progress in China&quot;. Meanwhile, the lack of a free market in China escalated to a new affair whereby the Chinese were restricted from carrying trade with foreigners. Foreign trade is a great source of foreign knowledge as well as the capability of acquisition of new products. Foreign trade promotes innovation as well as the expansion of a countries market. As Landes (2006) further puts it, in 1368 when the new emperor Hongwu was inaugurated, his main objective was war. (p. 6). A lot of revenue that can otherwise be used for innovative procedures are as a result lost in wars. Heavy participation in war significantly hindered the Chinese to have the capability of focusing on the industrial revolution. Landes (2006) further explains that Chinese were advised to stay put and never to move without permission from the Chinese state. As illustrated, &quot;The Ming code of core laws also sought to block social mobility&quot; (Landes, 2006, p. 7). How can you expect the industrial revolution to a country that prohibited its people from performing social mobility? From the above, you will come to find that it is clear that the Chinese would not be able to achieve industrial revolution since they were heavily tamed by their state government who were naïve about the aspect of innovation.

According to Justin Lin, China did not make the shift from an experience-based technological invention process to an experiment-based innovation process. The experience-based process depended on the size of a population, and while new technologies have come about through the trials and errors of the peasants and artisans, experiment-based processes surpasses experience-based processes in yielding new technology. Progress from experimentation following the logic of a scientific method can occur at a much faster rate because the inventor can perform many trials during the same production period under a controlled environment. Results from experimentation is dependent on the stock of scientific knowledge while results from experience-based processes is tied directly to the size of a population; hence, experiment-based innovation processes have a higher likelihood of producing better technology as human capital grows. China had about twice the population of Europe until the 13th century and so had a higher probability of creating new technologies. After the 14th century, China&#x27;s population grew exponentially, but progress in innovation saw diminishing returns. Europe had a smaller population but began to integrate science and technology that arose from the scientific revolution in the 17th century. This scientific revolution gave Europe a comparative advantage in developing technology in modern times.

Lin blamed the institutions in China for preventing the adoption of the experiment-based methodology. Its sociopolitical institution inhibited intellectual creativity, but more importantly, it diverted this creativity away from scientific endeavours. Totalitarian control by the state in the Chinese Empire inhibited public dispute, competition, and the growth of modern science, while the clusters of independent European nations were more favourable to competition and scientific development. In addition, the Chinese did not have the incentives to acquire human capital necessary for modern scientific experimentation. Civil service was deemed the most rewarding and honourable work in pre-modern China. The gifted had more incentives to pursue this route to move up the social status ladder as opposed to pursuing scientific endeavours. Further the laxity and lack of innovation exhibited by China made her to be surpassed by the growing European levels of technological advancement and innovation. As Landes (2006) puts forward, the Chinese lived as they wanted. They were ruled by an emperor &quot;Son of Heaven&quot; who they termed to be unique, and he was godlike. As he further adds, this emperor had arrogant representatives who were chosen in terms of &quot;competitive examinations in Confucian letters and morals.&quot; As explained, these representatives were submissive to their subordinates as they possessed a high degree of self-esteem. Just as put forward by Landes (2006), the downward tyranny combined with the cultural triumphalism had made China as a state to become a bad learner. (p. 11). It is clear China could not be able to accept any information from their inferiors.

The High-Level Equilibrium Trap. High population, although sometimes it can be a cheap source of labor which is necessary for economic development, sometimes the high population can be a great setback when it comes to development. The land which a factor of production can be negatively affected by high population. The ratio of person-to-land-area will eventually decrease as the population of a community grows. During the thirteenth century, China was significantly affected by this population factor when it came to the point of ignition of an industrial revolution. As Lin (1995) puts forward, initially, the culture of the Chinese has valued the males in the society; as a result, early marriages were experienced which boosted the fertility rates leading to the rapid increase in the China population. (p. 271). An increase in population with no equivalent increase in economic and technological development will ultimately suppress the available resources causing laxity to the general economic development. The high population experienced in China significantly raised the man to land ratio. The China population was massive. Just as Lin (1995) elaborates, the raising man-land-ratio in the Chinese meant that there was a diminishing surplus per capita. Due to this, China were not able to have surplus resources which can be tapped and used to ignite the industrial revolution. Just as Lin (1995) puts forward, Europeans were enjoying an optimum man to land ratio with no land strain. The Europeans also had vast unexploited technologies as well as economics possibilities. All these advantages were possible because of the feudal system that the European had embraced, (p. 272). The availability of unexploited ventures made European have significant potential in the execution of a fully-fledged industrial revolution. Lin (1995) further adds that although Europe was lagging behind China during the pre-modern era in terms of economic and technological advancements, the right time finally came for Europe to use the accumulated sufficient knowledge. A strong need to save labor was finally felt in Europe. The agrarian revolution experienced before also provided agricultural surplus that ultimately served as the core assets towards financing the industrial revolution. (p. 272). The accumulation of adequate labor and knowledge to their threshold was a significant step that the European embraced to ignite an industrial revolution. It is also clear that the agrarian revolution experienced in Europe was a tangible asset towards industrialization. The issue of the abundance of land was also at the forefront in ensuring that industrial revolution was realized in Europe contrary to what was experienced in China whereby the large populations put a lot of strain to the available resources as a result making industrial revolution unattainable in China during the early fourteenth century.

=== Evaluations and critiques ===
Needham&#x27;s work has been criticised by most scholars who assert that it has a strong inclination to exaggerate Chinese technological achievements and has an excessive propensity to assume a Chinese origin for the wide range of objects his work covered. Pierre-Yves Manguin writes, for instance:

J Needham&#x27;s (1971) monumental work on Chinese nautics offers by far the most
scholarly synthesis on the subjects of Chinese shipbuilding and navigation. His propensity to view the Chinese as the initiators of all things and his constant references to the superiority of Chinese over the rest of the world&#x27;s techniques does at times
detract from his argument.
In another vein of criticism, Andre Gunder Frank&#x27;s &quot;Re-Orient&quot; argues that despite Needham&#x27;s contributions in the field of Chinese technological history, he still struggled to break free from his preconceived notions of European exceptionalism. Re-Orient criticizes Needham for his Eurocentric assumptions borrowed from Marx and the presupposition of Needham&#x27;s famous Grand Question that science was a uniquely Western phenomenon. Frank observes:
Alas, it was also
originally Needham&#x27;s Marxist and Weberian point of departure. As
Needham found more and more evidence about science and technology
in China, he struggled to liberate himself from his Eurocentric original
sin, which he had inherited directly from Marx, as Cohen also observes.
But Needham never quite succeeded, perhaps because his concentration
on China prevented him from sufficiently revising his still ethnocentric
view of Europe itself.
T. H. Barrett asserts in &quot;The Woman Who Discovered Printing&quot; that Needham was unduly critical of Buddhism, describing it as having &#x27;tragically played a part in strangling the growth of Chinese science,&#x27; to which Needham readily conceded in a conversation a few years later. Barrett also criticizes Needham&#x27;s favoritism and uncritical evaluation of Taoism in Chinese technological history:
He had a tendency — not entirely justified in the light of more recent research — to think well of Taoism, because he saw it as playing a part that could not be found elsewhere in Chinese civilization. The mainstream school of thinking of the bureaucratic Chinese elite, or &#x27;Confucianism&#x27; (another problematic term) in his vocabulary, seemed to him to be less interested in science and technology, and to have &#x27;turned its face away from Nature.&#x27; Ironically, the dynasty that apparently turned away from printing from 706 till its demise in 907 was as Taoist as any in Chinese history, though perhaps its &#x27;state Taoism&#x27; would have seemed a corrupt and inauthentic business to Needham.
Daiwie Fu, in the essay &quot;On &quot;Mengxi bitan&quot;&#x27;s World of Marginalities and &#x27;South-pointing Needles&#x27;: Fragment Translation vs. Contextual Tradition&quot;, criticises Needham, among other Western scholars, for translations that select fragments deemed “scientific,” usually without appreciating the unity of the text, the context of the quotation, and taxonomy in which those fragments are embedded, then reorganize and reinterpret them in a new, Western taxonomy and narrative. Needham used this process of selection and re-assembly to argue for a Chinese tradition of science that did not exist as such.

Justin Lin argues against Needham&#x27;s premise that China&#x27;s early adoption of modern socioeconomic institutions contributed heavily to its technological advancement. Lin contends that technological advancements at this time were largely separate from economic circumstance, and that the effects of these institutions on technological advancement were indirect.

===Political involvement===
Needham&#x27;s political views were unorthodox and his lifestyle controversial. His left-wing stance was based in a form of Christian socialism. However he was influenced by Louis Rapkine and Liliana Lubińska, both Marxists brought up with a Jewish anti-clerical outlook. He never joined any Communist Party. After 1949 his sympathy with Chinese culture was extended to the new government. During his stay in China, Needham was asked to analyse some cattle cakes that had been scattered by American aircraft in the south of China at the end of World War II, and found they were impregnated with anthrax. During the Korean War he made further accusations that the Americans had used biological warfare. Zhou Enlai coordinated an international campaign to enlist Needham for a study commission, tacitly offering access to materials and contacts in China needed for his then early research. Needham agreed to be an inspector in North Korea and his report supported the allegations (it is debated to this very day whether the evidence had been planted as a part of a complicated disinformation campaign). Needham&#x27;s biographer Simon Winchester claimed that &quot;Needham was intellectually in love with communism; and yet communist spymasters and agents, it turned out, had pitilessly duped him.&quot; Needham was blacklisted by the US government until well into the 1970s.

In 1965, with Derek Bryan, a retired diplomat whom he first met in China, Needham established the Society for Anglo-Chinese Understanding, which for some years provided the only way for British subjects to visit the People&#x27;s Republic of China. On a visit to China in 1964 he was met by Zhou Enlai, and in 1965 stated that &quot;China has a better government now than for centuries&quot;, but on a visit in 1972 he was deeply depressed by the changes under the Cultural Revolution.

== Personal life ==
Needham married the biochemist Dorothy Moyle (1896–1987) in 1924 and they became the first husband and wife both to be elected as Fellows of the Royal Society.
Simon Winchester notes that, in his younger days, Needham was an avid gymnosophist and he was always attracted by pretty women. When he and Lu Gwei-djen met in 1937, they fell deeply in love, which Dorothy accepted. The three of them eventually lived contentedly on the same road in Cambridge for many years. In 1989, two years after Dorothy&#x27;s death, Needham married Lu, who died two years later. He suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease from 1982, and died at the age of 94 at his Cambridge home. In 2008, the Chair of Chinese in the University of Cambridge, a post never awarded to Needham, was endowed in his honour as the Joseph Needham Professorship of Chinese History, Science and Civilisation. Since 2016, an annual Needham Memorial Lecture is held at Clare College.

Needham was a high church Anglo-Catholic who worshipped regularly at Ely Cathedral and in the college chapel, but he also described himself as an &quot;honorary Taoist&quot;.

==Honours and awards==
In 1961, Needham was awarded the George Sarton Medal by the History of Science Society and in 1966 he became Master of Gonville and Caius College. 
In 1979, Joseph Needham received the Dexter Award for Outstanding Achievement in the History of Chemistry from the American Chemical Society.
In 1984, Needham became the fourth recipient of the J.D. Bernal Award, awarded by the Society for Social Studies of Science. In 1990, he was awarded the Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize by Fukuoka City.

The Needham Research Institute in Robinson College in Cambridge, devoted to the study of China&#x27;s scientific history, was opened in 1985 by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and Chancellor of Cambridge University.

<doc id="357827" wikidata="Q175081" url="?curid=357827" title="Gap, Hautes-Alpes">
<text>Gap (, ) is the prefecture of the department of Hautes-Alpes, in the region of Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur, Southeastern France. In 2019, the commune had a population of 40,631, making it the most populated city in Hautes-Alpes. At a height of 750 metres above sea level, to the south of the Écrins Massif, it is also France&#x27;s highest prefecture.

Together with other Alpine towns, Gap engages in the Alpine Town of the Year Association for the implementation of the Alpine Convention to achieve sustainable development in the Alpine Arc. Gap was awarded Alpine Town of the Year in 2002. In 2013 Gap was named the sportiest city in France by the national sports newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot;.

==Toponymy==

The first attestation of the name of the city is located in the ancient texts as &quot;Vappincum&quot;, later reduced to &quot;Vappum&quot;, the form of Gap is found in the 13th century.

The toponym &quot;Vappincum&quot; is analyzed on the basis of a radical &quot;Vapp-&quot; unknown meaning, and the suffix &quot;-incu&quot; of Ligurian origin found in Provence and the Massif central to the Alps (cf. Arlanc, Nonenque, Moirans and &quot;Morencum&quot; in the 10th century and Lemenc, a district of Chambéry, formerly &quot;Lemencum&quot;). The Gap form actually began as the short form &quot;Vappum&quot;, well attested, by the final drop.

The v- has been radically treated as a w- Germanic, where &quot;*Wap&quot;, then Gap (see for this type of evolution the wasp, Latin &quot;vespa&quot;, treats words as &quot;*wespa&quot;; mistletoe, Latin &quot;viscum&quot;, treated as &quot;*wiscum&quot;, etc., depending on the phonetic path [w] &gt; [gw] &gt; [g]). This phonetic evolution would be more specifically made under the influence of the Gothic language.

The name in Provençal (Alpine) is also &quot;Gap&quot;.

==History==

===Prehistory===
The first settlement of Gap dates back to the Neolithic. The culture of these first inhabitants belonged to the southern Chasséen.

Very rare testimonies of the pre-Roman era are formed by the remains of an oppidum located at the summit of the hill of &quot;Saint-Mens&quot; with few visible traces of a dolmen uncovered in 1866 and an ancient cemetery in the hamlet of Pré Camargue; but no remains were kept of these last two findings. Gallic money was also found. Gap was the capital of the Celto-Ligurian tribe. These peoples, probably belonging to the Caturiges tribe, spoke the Celtic language.

===The Roman period===

The was then part of the territory of the Tricorii, a Gallic people who were Romanised during the conquest of Gallia Narbonensis in 125-124 BC, and whose capitals were Luc-en-Diois and Vaison.

Around 20 BC, Cottius, a leader of tribes of the Valley of Suze, allied to Rome, and urged by Augustus, undertook the building of a route of communication in the Valley of the Durance. He had get the submission of the peoples of the area who were eager to maintain their independence. This route, built between 14 and 6 BC, and which received the name of &quot;Via Cottia per Alpem&quot;, linked Turin to Sisteron and consisted of six stations. Then known as &quot;Vapincum&quot;, the town of Gap was founded from one of these stations. In 22 AD, Gap became the start of a Roman road to Valence.

At this time, the location of the future city was a Roman camp. The camp was protected by a terraced wall surrounded by a ditch. It was the largest between Montgenèvre and Sisteron. The garrison that occupied it could be estimated at 360 men. They came from the surrounding peoples. They were assigned to protect users of the Roman roads against brigands. Later, an axis towards the was created. The Gap site took importance by becoming a hub of communications.

The economy was mainly pastoral and the first crops grew on the slopes of &quot;Puymaure&quot;. Some houses were built on stilts as shown by excavations.

During the first centuries, the population increased significantly. Towards the end of the 3rd century and 4th century, fortifications were built to protect the central core of the town. These completely surrounded the enclosure with walls and eleven towers. With an enclosed area of the center of the town formed a big village.

===Middle Ages===
From 28 December 986, the Bishop of Gap had sovereign rights over the city due to concerns about future Muslim invasions. The bishops kept this power until Revolutionary reforms in 1801 despite Gap being annexed by the French crown in 1512.

Gap and its area became part of the County of Provence which was established at the end of the 10th century. The County of Forcalquier was separated in the 12th century. Although the bishops of Gap were the temporal lords of the city their control was long disputed by officers of the Counts of Forcalquier notably during the episcopacy of Arnoux who later became the bishop of the city. On the death of the last Count of Forcalquier in 1209, the Embrun and Gap areas were passed to the Dauphiné while those of Forcalquier and Sisteron returned to the County of Provence. It is for this reason that the current coat of arms of the Region Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur is the coat of arms of the Dauphiné. In 1349 the Dauphin of Viennois Humbert II passed on his Principality to the eldest son of Philippe VI of France, the future King of France Charles V. From 1349 to 1457 Dauphiné remained a Principality separated from France, whose prince was the eldest son of the King of France. In 1457, Charles VII put an end to this status and joined the province to the Kingdom of France.

The Knights Templar owned a house at Gap, a secondary establishment which depended on a . The creation of the , which ruled the city, dated back to before 1209.

In the 14th century, the city took advantage of the benefits of the installation of the Popes in Avignon, which brought a more frequent passage of travellers to develop a craft of wool and skins, which made it thrive. Avignon linkages were strengthened by the presence of many clerics of the entourage of the Pope, within the chapter of the canons of Gap.

===Renaissance and early modern era===

The 16th and 17th centuries were particularly dark times for the city. The Wars of Religion were lethal in the region. Gap was a Catholic stronghold, while the switched to Protestantism. After various skirmishes, François de Bonne, leader of the Protestants, decided to attack Gap, nevertheless protected by 20 towers. On the night of 3 January 1577, François Philibert, known as &quot;Cadet de Charance&quot;, opened the Saint-Arey gate, and allowed him to attack the city by surprise. To cries of &quot;Kill! Kill!&quot; his men proceeded in veritable butchery. De Bonne burned the cathedral, plundered the monasteries, appropriated the property of the inhabitants, and built a proud citadel on the &quot;Colline de Puymaur&quot;e [Puymaure Hill] where it dominated over Gap. Returned to Catholicism in 1622, he abandoned all claims to the city.

In 1692, the troops of the ruler Victor Amadeus II, committed with the League of Augsburg, against France of Louis XIV, captured the city, abandoned by its inhabitants, on 29 August. Gap was looted and burned, of the 953 houses in the commune, 798 were destroyed. This was part of the .
In 1790, during the French Revolution, the province of Dauphiné was divided into three departments: Drôme, Isère and Hautes-Alpes which Gap became the prefecture. Hautes-Alpes then became the highest Department of France and Gap, the highest prefecture of the country. It remains prefecture of Haute-Alpes to this day.

===19th century===
In 1802, the baron was appointed . Under his administration, the city of Gap and the Department of the Hautes-Alpes experienced some growth. It built roads linking Gap to Italy and the Drôme Valley and created a departmental nursery. His statue, carved by the Gap sculptor Jean Marcellin, was erected in 1866 at the square which bears his name.
Napoleon I left Elba in February 1815 and stopped at Gap on 5 March 1815 with 40 horsemen and 10 grenadiers, where he had thousands of copies of his Proclamations printed. The whole population of the city accompanied Napoleon when he left Gap. Acknowledging the reception of the population of these regions, he left the Haut-Alpins with the following message:


Gap experienced a new era from 1875 with the arrival of the railway.

The commune of &quot;Chaudun&quot; was joined with Gap, by the prefectoral Decree of 22 October 1895.

===20th century===

====Second World War====
During World War II, the city was part of the free zone. But after November 1942 and the Case Anton, it was integrated into the occupied area. After Operation Overlord on 6 June 1944, the Germans placed some 1,000 men to hold the &quot;cuvette de Gap&quot; [Gap Basin], a key point of the Cannes-Lyon axis. , 37 years old, an original Gaullist resistant and accomplished soldier (he had trained more than 4000 resistance fighters in combat and about a hundred in sabotage) was sent by the GPRF of General de Gaulle to liberate the city on behalf of the Resistance. Aided by local guerrillas and resistance, he has however no way to take the city by force. He then started with his men in a campaign of sabotage and bombings that lasted more than a month. After having isolated the city by destroying the infrastructure surrounding it (overpasses, railway lines, bridges, etc.), the FFI had managed to rally the population and give the occupiers an impression of encirclement.

A mid-August 1944, Drouot-L&#x27;Hermine, who lost his right-hand man, , a few days earlier, sent two emissaries to negotiate the surrender of the Germans. The Germans were convinced of facing a large-scale uprising, and agreed to lay down their weapons provided that it was to regular troops (they refused, therefore, to surrender to the Resistance). While the Americans were more than away, time was pressing for Drouot-L&#x27;Hermine. Indeed, he received an order from De Gaulle to liberate the city before the arrival of the Allies, to support the position of France as a victorious nation, liberated through the active participation of the Resistance. Drouot-L&#x27;Ermine then developed a new ploy. He managed to convince the Allies to advance one of their tanks into enemy terrain, and shoot a few rounds close to Gap. Shots echoed in the valley, and the Germans immediately identified the characteristic sound of a tank, a weapon that the guerrillas did not hold. Thinking they were then dealing with the Allies, the troops of the Reich surrendered to the Resistance. Therefore, a few hundred resistance fighters were able to capture 1,200 German soldiers, including 40 officers. The city was liberated on the evening of 19 August 1944.

====Fifth Republic====
The commune of &quot;Romette&quot; was associated with that of Gap, by decree dated 25 November 1974.

Gap ran a bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics, but lost out as France&#x27;s candidate to nearby Annecy. The games were eventually awarded to Pyeongchang in South Korea.

==Geography==

===Location===

An Alpine crossroads at the intersection of D994 and the Route nationale 85, or &quot;Route Napoléon&quot;, which crosses the Col Bayard north of the city, Gap is located between the historic Dauphiné and the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur administrative region. With its 40,559 inhabitants (2018), it is the main town of an urban area of 80,555 inhabitants (2018), and the main town of the Southern French Alps. above sea level, at the right bank of the river , close to where it joins the Durance to the north, Gap is in the midst of a rich and preserved natural environment, south-west of the Écrins National Park, south-east of the Dévoluy massif and west of the Lac de Serre-Ponçon. The region around Gap is known as .

===Geology and terrain===
The commune of Gap is almost entirely located in the &quot;Sillon de Gap&quot; [Gap trench], a wide valley bottom located about above sea level and including the western slopes almost (Charance mountain and pic de Gleize).

The highest point of the municipality is however outside this great valley, on another watershed slope, the Raz de Bec, at , is within the limits of the commune, and was in the former commune of Chaudun, which merged with Gap in the 19th century.

This valley was shaped by the &quot;Glacier de la Durance&quot; during the last ice age, known as the Würm glaciation.

Thus, soils are very often formed by moraine deposits. No less than five levels of lateral and frontal moraines are observable. These are clearly visible, especially on the southern slopes of the Col Bayard, where they were formed in places of the terraces used by agriculture.

In retreating, the glacier also left erratics of several metres high. Examples include, among others, the erratic boulders of &quot;Peyre-Ossel&quot; and &quot;Justice&quot;.

The glacier, which in the Quaternary has shaped the &quot;Sillon de Gap&quot;, presented several : one to the glacier of the Drac from the cols of Manse and Bayard and one towards the Buëch Valley by the La Freissinouse border.

The cover of morainic debris is omnipresent in the &quot;Sillon de Gap&quot; but is not the only vestige of the Quaternary glaciation. There is also the typical topography of glacial valleys. The location of the town of Gap corresponds to an &quot;Ombilic glaciaire&quot;, where large quantities of clay were deposited. Upstream lies the [glacial lock] of Pont-Sarrazin and downstream of Tourronde.

The mechanical action of the &quot;glacier de la Durance&quot; was facilitated by the presence of relatively friable layers. The part which is central and south-east of the town consists mainly of soft rocks (Callovo-Oxfordian black marl). They consist of soft schist of bluish or brown colors. In the northwestern part are the harder rocks of lighter colours, Tithonian limestone, formed in places of rocky bars or cornices.

===Hydrography===
The town of Gap is crossed by the , a tributary of the Durance which has a total course of . During its passage through the commune, the Luye receives several torrents. It merges on the right bank with the long &quot;Buzon&quot;, the &quot;Bonne&quot; () and the &quot;torrent du Cristaye&quot; (); and on the left bank, the &quot;La Magdeleine Canal&quot; (), the &quot;Riotord&quot; () and the &quot;torrent du Partiment&quot;, () long.

Even if the Luye hydrographic basin represents the largest share of the commune, waters at the southwest of the commune (the Saint-Jean quarter) drain into the torrent of Malecombe, a tributary of the Rousine, which flows into the Durance south of Tallard.

In the Northwest of the commune (located on the other side of the col de Gleize) lie the sources. Around above sea level, they are formed by several streams which converge at the old village of .

Finally, an important channel feeds Gap with drinking water and water for irrigation: The , or &quot;Canal du Drac&quot;, about long, leads the water captured in the Drac via a tunnel under the Col de Manse to the Jaussauds reservoir (altitude ) where it divides into two branches, including the main branch which bypasses Gap west to Correo through Charance.

===Climate===

Gap features an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;), according to the Köppen system, with some continental influence due to its elevation. Very influenced by its interior position, the city experiences cold, snowy winters and warm summers.

Thus the main feature of the local climate is the importance of the sunshine enjoyed by the city. Furthermore, snowfall underscores the mountain character of the city. Thunderstorms are frequent in summer, fog is rather rare.

The tables below represent averages of monthly temperatures.

They also show the maximum and minimum mean temperatures over the period from 1951 to 1970.

Comparisons with surveys of the period from 1878 to 1940 showed lower maximum averages over the period from 1950 to 1970 for the winter and summer months. Over the same period, again for the winter and summer months, there was an increase in the average minimum. Thus the evolution of the climate tends towards a slight reduction of differences in winter temperatures on the one hand, and summer on the other.

Extreme temperatures also highlight the mountain and Mediterranean components of the climate. Indeed, over the decade 1951-1960 the absolute minimum recorded was on 3 February 1956. While the absolute maximum was of observed 8 July 1952.

The evolution of the average monthly temperatures (in red) and an average monthly rainfall (in blue) are summarized in the chart below.

Outside of the valley breezes, the prevailing wind is from the north, locally named the &quot;bise&quot; wind. In fact, it is a component of the mistral. Up the Drac Valley, this wind crosses the Bayard plateau down to Gap. When it carries clouds, there is the phenomenon of &quot;the bar of Bayard&quot;: a compact pile of clouds covering the Bayard plateau. Pushed by the wind, they descend into the valley. Under the effect of the increase in pressure and temperature, these clouds disappear immediately a few hundred metres further down. Even in perpetual motion, cloud cover appears motionless. If these conditions are synonymous with freshness in autumn and spring, and bright cold in the winter, they are always accompanied by a perfectly sunny and clear atmosphere above the city.

===Channels of communication and transport===
====Road network====
The town of Gap lies at a crossroads. The route nationale RN 85 heads towards the north and the south, the to the east and the departmental RD 994 road to the west.

The RN 85 travels north to Grenoble. Sisteron is located in the opposite direction, and eventually also to the Mediterranean. The RN 94 travels to reach Briançon and towards Italy via the Col de Montgenèvre. Meanwhile, the RD 994 joins with Pont-Saint-Esprit in Gard, more than distant.

 separates Gap from La Saulce on the A51 motorway. This highway provides fast travel to Aix-en-Provence and Marseille away, via the Durance Valley. A planned extension of this highway to the north, to the seems definitively buried. Although it has been desired by elected officials for the voters and the State, in order to divert trucks from the A7, the absence of this highway has not created the announced decline. On the contrary, the city ceased to grow (see demographics) without being absorbed by its relatively distant neighbours thanks precisely to its relative isolation from the main road network, including Grenoble (in no effect a dormitory community).

Taking into account the increase in road traffic, the creation of an urban boulevard became a prospect of improvement. This one long and comprising several structures, could bypass the city from the west. Concerning also the transit of traffic serving the city itself, it would act as a bypass, leaving the RN 85, close to the area of Micropolis to the southwest and lead to the RN 94, north-east towards the Romette intersection.

====Rail====

The city is served by SNCF. Gap station is connected directly to Paris daily by a night train , but also by regional trains to Briançon, Grenoble, Valence (Gare de Valence-Ville and Gare de Valence TGV), as well as to Aix-en-Provence and Marseille.

In the 1930s, work aimed at the establishment of a metric line between Gap and Corps by the Col de Manse was undertaken. These were never finished and the was never born. Portions were reused for the basis of the route nationale.

The was also begun in the east, but never completed. A double curve viaduct remains beneath the waters of the Lac de Serre-Ponçon.

====Air transport====
Located from Gap, the Gap–Tallard Airport can handle passenger traffic.

Two-thirds of them are apartments (almost 65%). A majority of these houses consist of 4 rooms (30%) or 5 rooms (28%). Overall, the buildings date from the period between 1946 and 1990 (65%). Half of the inhabitants of principal residences are owners (51%), the share of social rental housing (HLM) represents only 15%.

<doc id="357828" wikidata="Q218842" url="?curid=357828" title="Zolpidem">
<text>Zolpidem, sold under the brand name Ambien among others, is a medication primarily used for the short-term treatment of sleeping problems. Guidelines recommend that it be used only after cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia and after behavioral changes, such as sleep hygiene, have been tried. It decreases the time to sleep onset by about fifteen minutes and at larger doses helps people stay asleep longer. It is taken by mouth and is available as conventional tablets, extended-release tablets, or sublingual tablets.
Common side effects include daytime sleepiness, headache, nausea, and diarrhea. More severe side effects include memory problems and hallucinations. While flumazenil, a GABAA–receptor antagonist, can reverse zolpidem&#x27;s effects, usually supportive care is all that is recommended in overdose.
Zolpidem is a nonbenzodiazepine, or Z-drug, which acts as a sedative and hypnotic as a positive allosteric modulator at the GABAA receptor. It is an imidazopyridine and increases GABA effects in the central nervous system by binding to GABAA receptors at the same location as benzodiazepines. 
In 2025, it became known that it also suppresses the norepinephrine effect and reduces glymphatic flow, i.e. it suppresses the brain&#x27;s waste disposal, which explains some of its adverse effects.

It generally has a half-life of two to three hours. This, however, is increased in those with liver problems.
Zolpidem was approved for medical use in the United States in 1992. It became available as a generic medication in 2007. Zolpidem is a schedule IV controlled substance in the US under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (CSA). More than 10million prescriptions are filled each year in the United States, making it one of the most commonly used treatments for sleeping problems. In 2022, it was the 66th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 9million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Zolpidem is labeled for short-term (usually about two to six weeks) treatment of insomnia at the lowest possible dose. It may be used for both improving sleep onset, sleep onset latency, and staying asleep.

Guidelines from NICE, the European Sleep Research Society, and the American College of Physicians recommend medication for insomnia (including possible zolpidem) only as a second-line treatment after non-pharmacological treatment options have been tried (e.g. cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia). This is based in part on a 2012 review which found that zolpidem&#x27;s effectiveness is nearly as much due to psychological effects as to the medication itself.

==Contraindications==
Use of zolpidem may impair driving skills with a resultant increased risk of road traffic accidents. This adverse effect is not unique to zolpidem but also occurs with other hypnotic drugs. Caution should be exercised by motor vehicle drivers. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends lower doses of zolpidem due to impaired function the day after taking it.

Zolpidem should not be prescribed to older people, who are more sensitive to the effects of hypnotics including zolpidem, and are at an increased risk of falls and adverse cognitive effects, such as delirium and neurocognitive disorder.

Animal studies have revealed evidence of incomplete ossification and increased intrauterine fetal death at doses greater than seven times the maximum recommended human dose or higher; however, teratogenicity was not observed at any dose level. There are no controlled data on human pregnancy. In one case report, zolpidem was found in cord blood at delivery. Zolpidem is recommended for use during pregnancy only when the benefits outweigh the risks.

==Adverse effects==

The most common adverse effects of short-term use include headache (reported by 7% of people in clinical trials), drowsiness (2%), dizziness (1%), and diarrhea (1%); the most common side effects of long-term use included
drowsiness (8%),
dizziness (5%),
allergy (4%),
sinusitis (4%),
back pain (3%),
diarrhea (3%),
drugged feeling (3%),
dry mouth (3%),
lethargy (3%),
sore throat (3%),
abdominal pain (2%),
constipation (2%),
heart palpitations (2%),
lightheadedness (2%),
rash (2%),
abnormal dreams (1%),
amnesia (1%),
chest pain (1%),
depression (1%),
flu-like symptoms (1%),
and sleep disorder (1%).

Zolpidem increases the risk of depression, falls and bone fracture, poor driving, suppressed respiration and has been associated with an increased risk of death. Upper and lower respiratory infections are also common (experienced by 1–10% of people).

Residual &#x27;hangover&#x27; effects, such as sleepiness and impaired psychomotor and cognitive function, may persist into the day following nighttime administration. Such effects may impair the ability of users to drive safely and increase risks of falls and hip fractures. Around 3% of people taking zolpidem are likely to break a bone as a result of a fall due to impaired coordination caused by the drug.

===Sleepwalking and complex sleep behaviors===
Zolpidem is associated with complex sleep behaviors (CSBs), defined as activities performed during sleep followed by amnesia. These activities may include walking, driving, eating, having sex, having conversations, and performing other daily activities while asleep. Research by Australia&#x27;s National Prescribing Service found these activities typically occur after the first dose or within a few days of starting therapy, although they may occur at any time during treatment.

Concerns regarding zolpidem-related CSBs have prompted actions by regulatory authorities, including Australia&#x27;s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In February 2008, the TGA implemented a boxed warning for the drug. In January 2013, the FDA issued a safety communication addressing next-morning cognitive impairment associated with the drug. In May 2013, the FDA recommended avoiding activities requiring alertness the day after using extended-release formulations. In April 2019, the FDA strengthened the drug&#x27;s warning labeling by adding a black box warning highlighting the risk of serious injuries and fatalities related to CSBs, even at recommended doses and after single use, and added a contraindication advising against zolpidem use in patients with a history of CSBs.

===Tolerance, dependence and withdrawal===
As zolpidem is associated with drug tolerance and substance dependence, its prescription guidelines are only for severe insomnia and short periods of use at the lowest effective dose. Tolerance to the effects of zolpidem can develop in some people in just a few weeks. Abrupt withdrawal may cause delirium, seizures, or other adverse effects, especially if used for prolonged periods and at high doses. When drug tolerance and physical dependence to zolpidem develop, treatment usually entails a gradual dose reduction over a period of months to minimize withdrawal symptoms, which can resemble those seen during benzodiazepine withdrawal. Failing that, an alternative method may be necessary for some people, such as a switch to a benzodiazepine equivalent dose of a longer-acting benzodiazepine drug, as for diazepam or chlordiazepoxide, followed by a gradual reduction in dose of the long-acting benzodiazepine. In people who are difficult to treat, an inpatient flumazenil administration allows for rapid competitive binding of flumazenil to GABAA–receptor as an antagonist, thus stopping (and effectively detoxifying) zolpidem from being able to bind as an agonist on GABAA–receptor; slowly drug dependence or addiction to zolpidem will wane.

Alcoholics or recovering alcoholics may be at increased risk of physical dependency or abuse of zolpidem. It is not typically prescribed in people with a history of alcoholism, recreational drug use, physical dependency, or psychological dependency on sedative-hypnotic drugs. A 2014 review found evidence of drug-seeking behavior, with prescriptions for zolpidem making up 20% of falsified or forged prescriptions.

Rodent studies of the tolerance-inducing properties have shown that zolpidem has less tolerance-producing potential than benzodiazepines, but in primates, the tolerance-producing potential of zolpidem was the same as seen with benzodiazepines.

===Overdose===
Overdose can lead to coma or death.

Zolpidem overdose can be treated with the GABAA receptor antagonist flumazenil, which displaces zolpidem from its binding site on the GABAA receptor to rapidly reverse the effects of the zolpidem.

===Detection in body fluids===
Zolpidem may be quantitated in blood or plasma to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in people who are hospitalized, to provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest, or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma zolpidem concentrations are usually in a range of 30–300μg/L in persons receiving the drug therapeutically, 100–700μg/L in those arrested for impaired driving, and 1000–7000μg/L in victims of acute overdosage. Analytical techniques, in general, involve gas or liquid chromatography.

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===

Zolpidem is a ligand of high-affinity positive modulator sites of GABAA receptors, which enhances GABAergic inhibition of neurotransmission in the central nervous system. It selectively binds to α1 subunits of this pentameric ion channel. Accordingly, it has strong hypnotic properties and weak anxiolytic, myorelaxant, and anticonvulsant properties. Opposed to diazepam, zolpidem is able to bind to binary αβ GABA receptors, where it was shown to bind to the α1–α1 subunit interface. Zolpidem has about 10-fold lower affinity for the α2- and α3- subunits than for α1, and no appreciable affinity for α5 subunit-containing receptors. ω1 type GABAA receptors are the α1-containing GABAA receptors and are found primarily in the brain, the ω2 receptors are those that contain the α2-, α3-, α4-, α5-, or α6 subunits, and are found primarily in the spine. Thus, zolpidem favours binding to GABAA receptors located in the brain rather than the spine. Zolpidem has no affinity for γ1 and γ3 subunit-containing receptors and, like the vast majority of benzodiazepine-like drugs, it lacks affinity for receptors containing α4 and α6. Zolpidem modulates the receptor presumably by inducing a receptor conformation that enables an increased binding strength of the orthosteric agonist GABA towards its cognate receptor without affecting desensitization or peak currents.

In 2025, zolpidem was shown that zolpidem supresses the norepinephrine mediated pump effect in the brain and reduces glymphatic flow, thereby suppressing waste disposal.
Like zaleplon, zolpidem may increase slow-wave sleep but cause no effect on stage 2 sleep. 

A 2004 meta-analysis compared benzodiazepines against nonbenzodiazepines and showed few consistent differences between zolpidem and benzodiazepines in terms of sleep onset latency, total sleep duration, number of awakenings, quality of sleep, adverse events, tolerance, rebound insomnia, and daytime alertness.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Microsome studies indicate zolpidem is metabolized by CYP3A4 (61%) CYP2C9 (22%), CYP1A2 (14%), CYP2D6 (&lt;3%), and CYP2C19 (&lt;3%). Less than 1% is excreted in urine unchanged. It is principally metabolized into three metabolites, none of which are believed to be pharmacologically active. The absolute bioavailability of zolpidem is about 70%. The drug reaches peak concentration in about 2 hours and has a half-life in healthy adults of about 2–3 hours. Zolpidem&#x27;s half life is decreased in children and increased in the elderly and people with liver issues. While some studies show men metabolize zolpidem faster than women (possibly due to testosterone), others do not. A review found only a 33% lower clearance in women compared to men, suggesting the FDA&#x27;s dosage reduction of 50% for women may have been too large.

==Interactions==
People should not consume alcohol while taking zolpidem, and should not be prescribed opioid drugs nor take such illicit drugs recreationally. Use of opioids with zolpidem increases the risk of respiratory depression and death. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is advising that the opioid addiction medications buprenorphine and methadone should not be withheld from patients taking benzodiazepines or other drugs that depress the central nervous system (CNS).

Next day sedation can be worsened if people take zolpidem while they are also taking antipsychotics, other sedatives, anxiolytics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and antihistamines. Some people taking antidepressants have had visual hallucinations when they also took zolpidem.

Cytochrome P450 inhibitors, particularly CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 inhibitors such as fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, and clarithromycin will increase the effects of a given dose of zolpidem. Cytochrome P450 activators like St. John&#x27;s Wort may decrease the activity of zolpidem. One study found that caffeine increases the concentration over time curve of zolpidem by about 20% and furthermore found that caffeine cannot adequately compensate for the impaired cognition caused by zolpidem. Other studies show no effect of caffeine on zolpidem metabolism.

==Chemistry==
Three chemical syntheses of zolpidem are common. 4-Methylacetophenone is used as a common precursor. This is brominated and reacted with 2-amino-5-methylpyridine to give the imidazopyridine. From here the reactions use a variety of reagents to complete the synthesis, either involving thionyl chloride or sodium cyanide. These reagents are challenging to handle and require thorough safety assessments. Though such safety procedures are common in the industry, they make clandestine manufacture difficult.

Several major side-products of the sodium cyanide reaction have been characterised and include dimers and mannich products.

Alpidem is also an imidazopyridine and is an analogue of zolpidem. Both agents are GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators. However, whereas zolpidem is used as a hypnotic and sedative, alpidem was used as an anxiolytic.

==History==
Zolpidem was used in Europe starting in 1988 and was brought to market there by Synthelabo. Synthelabo and Searle collaborated to bring it to market in the US, and it was approved in the United States in 1992 under the brand name &quot;Ambien&quot;. It became available as a generic medication in 2007.

In 2015, the American Geriatrics Society said that zolpidem, eszopiclone, and zaleplon met the Beers criteria and should be avoided in individuals 65 and over &quot;because of their association with harms balanced with their minimal efficacy in treating insomnia.&quot; The AGS stated the strength of the recommendation that older adults avoid zolpidem is &quot;strong&quot; and the quality of evidence supporting it is &quot;moderate.&quot;

==Society and culture==
Prescriptions in the US for all sleeping pills (including zolpidem) steadily declined from around 57 million tablets in 2013, to around 47 million in 2017, possibly due to concern about prescribing addictive drugs amid the opioid crisis.

===Military use===
As of 2012, the United States Air Force used zolpidem as one of the hypnotics approved as a &quot;no-go pill&quot; with a six-hour restriction on subsequent flight operation to help aviators and special duty personnel sleep in support of mission readiness. (The other hypnotics used are temazepam and zaleplon.) &quot;Ground tests&quot; are required before an authorization is issued to use the medication in an operational situation.

===Recreational use===
Zolpidem has potential for medical misuse when the drug is continued long term without or against medical advice, or for recreational use when the drug is taken to achieve a &quot;high&quot;. The transition from medical use of zolpidem to high-dose addiction or drug dependence can occur with use, but some believe it may be more likely when used without a clinical recommendation to continue using it, when physiological drug tolerance leads to higher doses than the usual 5mg or 10mg, when consumed through insufflation or injection, or when taken for purposes other than as a sleep aid. Recreational use is more prevalent in those having been dependent on other drugs in the past, but tolerance and drug dependence can still sometimes occur in those without a history of drug dependence. Chronic users of high doses are more likely to develop physical dependence on the drug, which may cause severe withdrawal symptoms, including seizures if abrupt withdrawal from zolpidem occurs.

Other drugs, including benzodiazepines and zopiclone, are also found in high numbers of suspected drugged drivers. Many drivers have blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic dose range, suggesting a high degree of excessive-use potential for benzodiazepines, zolpidem, and zopiclone. U.S. Congressman Patrick J. Kennedy says that he was using zolpidem (Ambien) and promethazine (Phenergan) when he was caught driving erratically at 3 a.m. &quot;I simply do not remember getting out of bed, being pulled over by the police, or being cited for three driving infractions,&quot; Kennedy said.

, nonmedical use of zolpidem is common for some adolescents. Some users have reported decreased anxiety, mild euphoria, perceptual changes, visual distortions, and hallucinations. Zolpidem was used by Australian Olympic swimmers at the London Olympics in 2012, leading to controversy.

===Regulation===
For the stated reason of its potential for recreational use and dependence, zolpidem (along with the other benzodiazepine-like Z-drugs) is a schedule IV substance under the Controlled Substances Act in the US. The United States patent for zolpidem was held by the French pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis.

===Use in crime===
The Z-drugs, including zolpidem, have been used as date rape drugs. Zolpidem is available by prescription, and broadly prescribed unlike other date rape drugs: gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), which is used to treat narcolepsy, or flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), which is only prescribed as a second-line choice for insomnia. Zolpidem can be detected in bodily fluids for 36 hours, though it may be possible to detect it by hair testing much later, which is due to the short elimination half-life of 2.5–3 hours. This use of the drug was highlighted during proceedings against Darren Sharper, who was accused of using the tablets he was prescribed to facilitate a series of rapes.

===Sleepwalking and complex sleep behaviors===
Zolpidem has drawn significant media attention due to reports of complex sleep behaviors (CSBs), including sleepwalking, sleep-driving, and other activities performed while not fully conscious. Notable incidents include media reports in the United States concerning events such as Congressman Patrick Kennedy&#x27;s motor vehicle accident and in Australia following a fatal fall from the Sydney Harbour Bridge involving an individual reportedly under the influence of zolpidem.

In May 2018, actress Roseanne Barr attributed a controversial remark on Twitter to the effects of zolpidem. Barr&#x27;s tweet compared Valerie Jarrett, a Black woman and former advisor to Barack Obama, to an ape. The comparison sparked widespread condemnation and led to the cancellation of &quot;Roseanne&quot;. The incident prompted Sanofi, the manufacturer of Ambien, to issue a public statement clarifying that &quot;racism is not a known side effect&quot; of the medication.

===Brand names===
As of September 2018, zolpidem is marketed under many brands.

==Research==
While cases of zolpidem improving aphasia in people with stroke have been described, use for this purpose has unclear benefits. Zolpidem has also been studied in persistent vegetative states with unclear effect. A 2017 systematic review concluded that while there is preliminary evidence of benefit for treating disorders of movement and consciousness other than insomnia (including Parkinson&#x27;s disease), more research is needed.

Animal studies in FDA files for zolpidem showed a dose dependent increase in some types of tumors, although the studies were too small to reach statistical significance. Some observational epidemiological studies have found a correlation between use of benzodiazepines and certain hypnotics including zolpidem and an increased risk of getting cancer, but others have found no correlation; a 2017 meta-analysis of such studies found a correlation, stating that use of hypnotics was associated with a 29% increased risk of cancer, and that &quot;zolpidem use showed the strongest risk of cancer&quot; with an estimated 34% increased risk, but noted that the results were tentative because some of the studies failed to control for confounders like cigarette smoking and alcohol use, and some of the studies analyzed were case–controls, which are more prone to some forms of bias. Similarly, a meta-analysis of benzodiazepine drugs also shows their use is associated with increased risk of cancer.

<text>The Spanish National Organization of the Blind (), commonly known as the ONCE (, as in the Spanish word for the number 11), is a Spanish foundation founded on December 13, 1938, to raise funds to provide services for the blind and people with serious visual impairment.

Although it is overseen by a board of patrons made up of representatives from various Spanish ministries, it does enjoy a certain amount of freedom of movement in the day-to-day running of its activities, and its general council is democratically elected from among its members.

As of September 2013, membership of the organization was 71,460 people, of whom 40% were over the age of 65.

Between them, the three pillars of the ONCE—the Directorate-General, the Foundation and CEOSA, ONCE&#x27;s business corporation—employ over 136,000 staff, of whom 88.5% are people with disabilities.

In September 2013, coinciding with the organization&#x27;s 75th anniversary, the ONCE was awarded Spain&#x27;s Premio Príncipe de Asturias for Concord.

From 1989 to 2003, ONCE sponsored one of Spain&#x27;s leading cycling teams.

==Organization==
While many of their activities overlap, there are, at least formally, three divisions of the ONCE:

===Directorate-General===
The Directorate-General is responsible for the day-to-day running of the organization, its social and cultural work, and so on. Through its general council, it maintains institutional relations with local, regional and national government bodies, as well as representation on international bodies such as the World Blind Union, EBU and the IBSA (IBSA).

===ONCE Foundation===
In 1988 ONCE established the ONCE foundation () to provide professional training and employment, to eliminate architectural, urban and communication barriers and promote &quot;Digital Solidarity&quot;, web-based services for people with any disabilities. The Fundación also has its own business arm, Fundosa, with companies dealing with accessibility, industrial laundering, and so on.

The Fundación is active in the Paralympic movement and is a founding partner of the European Network for Accessible Tourism (ENAT), an international organization set up in 2006 to promote accessible tourism.

The Fundación has attracted support from the Spanish royal family. In May 2010, Princess Letizia presented awards at a Fundación awareness-raising event. In March 2011, the Princess presented the Fundacion&#x27;s DISCAPNET awards, celebrating innovation in accessibility.

===ONCE Business Corporation===
The ONCE Business Corporation (, CEOSA) is the business corporation of ONCE and owns, or is a stakeholder in, several companies across a wide range of sectors, including service companies, hotels and food companies. In the 1980s, and in order to diversify the risk of any future decrease in sales of the &quot;cupón&quot;, the managers of the ONCE started a policy of profit-oriented investment.

One of its acquisitions was a sizeable participation in the Spanish private TV channel Telecinco and the radio network Onda Cero (&quot;Airwave Zero&quot;, based on the &quot;ON&quot;da &quot;CE&quot;ro acronym). The most visible effect was the Telecinco broadcast of the daily lottery draw, the &quot;Telecupón&quot;, presented by the popular retired actress Carmen Sevilla.

Critics pointed to the paradox of blind &quot;upstarts&quot; running one of the newly created commercial TV channels. There were also critics who claimed that it was a manoeuvre of the then-ruling party in government, the Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) to indirectly control the media in general.

Later management teams divested from Telecinco following a major judicial investigation into supposed tax dodges, etc., by the main shareholder, a company belonging to Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s Fininvest.

ONCE no longer has a stake in either of these media companies, although it does still run a media company, Servimedia, that is a news agency specialising in providing information on issues of social interest, such as disability, integration, corporate social responsibility, leisure, etc.

==The &quot;Cupón&quot;==

Although ONCE now has several gaming products available, their traditional product and one of the most visible aspects of ONCE is the charity lottery ticket known throughout Spain as the &quot;Cupón&quot;. Sales of this lottery product are the main source of income for ONCE and can carry huge tax-exempt cash prizes. The draw has different tickets for different days of the week, a special weekend ticket as well as special tickets with higher prizes, usually by season. The draw has for many years been broadcast live every night on Spanish TV channels, including Telecinco, Cuatro and CNN+. As of January 3, 2017, it is shown on the Spanish television channel La 1.

The basic graphic designs on the &quot;cupón&quot; is the same every day, but the theme changes to correspond to current events. For example, when the Euro became legal tender, or cultural references such as national or local monuments. Collecting old issues of the &quot;cupón&quot; has thus become a hobby for many &quot;cupón&quot; buyers in Spain.

===Cupón Diario===
The &quot;Cupón Diario&quot; (daily cupón) is drawn daily (Monday to Friday) as a five-digit number and a Series number. Each ticket costs €2.00. Prizes can vary, based on how many of the five digits a particular &quot;cupón&quot; has, or the sum of all numbers on the cupón and the Series number. The digits have to be in order to win, from left to right. The lowest prize is effectively a refund of the €2.00 that was used to purchase a ticket. ONCE lottery tickets are sold on the streets by authorised &quot;cupón&quot; sellers, as well as in ONCE kiosks. These are clearly identified by the word &quot;ONCE&quot; and can be found along the high street, at airports, and in shopping malls. These points of sales employ the blind or partially sighted, which is one of the main goals of ONCE, although by agreement with Fundación ONCE, over the last few years some have become available to people with other disabilities.
Once sells tickets online, at the website juegosonce.es. Likewise, to prevent attempts of fraudulent manipulation and counterfeiting, the &quot;cupón&quot; itself has a number of embedded security features of different kinds, such as optically variable devices, that are extremely difficult to reproduce. The &quot;cupón&quot; sellers use electronic reading devices with access to the ONCE database to check each winning number and the &quot;cupón&quot;&#x27;s authenticity. Major (tax-exempt) cash prizes are paid directly into bank accounts once the winner has established contact with the organisation through its delegations throughout Spain.

==Sponsorship==
From 1989 until the end of the 2003 season, ONCE sponsored one of the leading Spanish cycling teams. Whilst hugely successful in sporting terms and as a marketing vehicle, it was a costly project that was increasingly difficult to justify in terms of the ONCE&#x27;s commitment to social integration of its members. Their former directeur sportif, Manolo Saiz, went on to form the Liberty Seguros–Würth team.

<text>Rowan Gavin Paton Menzies (14 August 1937 – 12 April 2020) was a British submarine lieutenant-commander who authored books claiming that the Chinese sailed to America before Columbus. Historians have rejected Menzies&#x27; theories and assertions and have categorised his work as pseudohistory.

He was best known for his controversial book &quot;1421: The Year China Discovered the World&quot;, in which he asserts that the fleets of Chinese Admiral Zheng He visited the Americas prior to European explorer Christopher Columbus in 1492, and that the same fleet circumnavigated the globe a century before the expedition of Ferdinand Magellan. Menzies&#x27; second book, &quot;1434: The Year a Magnificent Chinese Fleet Sailed to Italy and Ignited the Renaissance&quot;, extended his discovery hypothesis to the European continent. In his third book, &quot;The Lost Empire of Atlantis&quot;, Menzies claims that Atlantis did exist, in the form of the Minoan civilization, and that it maintained a global seaborne empire extending to the shores of America and India, millennia before actual contact in the Age of Discovery.

==Biography==

Menzies was born in London, and his family moved to China when he was three weeks old. He was educated at Orwell Park Preparatory School in Suffolk, and Charterhouse. Menzies dropped out of school when he was fifteen years old and joined the Royal Navy in 1953. He never attended university and had no formal training in historical studies. From 1959 to 1970, Menzies served on British submarines. Menzies claims he sailed the routes sailed by Ferdinand Magellan and James Cook while he was commanding officer of the diesel submarine between 1968 and 1970, a contention questioned by some of his critics. He often refers back to his sea-faring days to support claims made in &quot;1421&quot;.

In 1959, by his own account, Menzies was an officer on on a voyage from Singapore to Africa, around the Cape of Good Hope, and on to Cape Verde and back to England. Menzies claimed that the knowledge of the winds, currents, and sea conditions that he gained on this voyage was essential to reconstructing the 1421 Chinese voyage that he discusses in his first book. Critics have challenged the depth of his nautical knowledge. In 1969, Menzies was involved in an incident in the Philippines, when &quot;Rorqual&quot; rammed a U.S. Navy minesweeper, , which was moored at a pier. This collision punched a hole in &quot;Endurance&quot; but did not damage &quot;Rorqual&quot;. The ensuing enquiry found Menzies and one of his subordinates responsible for a combination of factors that led to the accident, including the absence of the coxswain (who usually takes the helm in port) who had been replaced by a less experienced crew member, and technical issues with the boat&#x27;s telegraph.

Menzies retired the next year, and campaigned unsuccessfully as an independent candidate in Wolverhampton South West during the 1970 United Kingdom general election, where—standing against Enoch Powell—he called for unrestricted immigration to Great Britain, drawing 0.2% of the vote. In 1990, Menzies began researching Chinese maritime history. He had, however, no academic training and no command of the Chinese language, which his critics argue prevented him from understanding original source material relevant to his thesis. Menzies trained as a barrister, but in 1996 he was declared a vexatious litigant by HM Courts Service which prohibited him from taking legal action in England and Wales without prior judicial permission.) Menzies was made an honorary professor at Yunnan University in China.

==&quot;1421: The Year China Discovered the World&quot;==
===Writing and research===

Gavin Menzies had the idea to write his first book after he and his wife Marcella visited the Forbidden City for their twenty-fifth wedding anniversary. Menzies noticed that they kept encountering the year 1421 and, concluding that it must have been an extraordinary year in world history, decided to write a book about everything that happened in the world in 1421. Menzies spent years working on the book and, by the time it was finished, it was a massive volume spanning 1,500 pages. Menzies sent the manuscript to an agent named Luigi Bonomi, who told him it was unpublishable, but was intrigued by a brief section of the book in which Menzies speculated about the voyages of Chinese admiral Zheng He and recommended that he rewrite the book, focusing it on Zheng He&#x27;s voyages. Menzies agreed to rewrite it, but admitted that he was &quot;not a natural writer&quot; and requested Bonomi to rewrite the first three chapters for him.

Bonomi contacted the firm Midas Public Relations to persuade a major newspaper to run a promotional article for Menzies&#x27;s book. Menzies paid £1,200 to reserve a lecture hall at the Royal Geographical Society in order to unveil his claims; that was enough to convince &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; to write an article about his speculations. The &quot;Telegraph&quot; article was syndicated worldwide and became a sensation, even though Menzies had not yet even presented his claims. Arrangements were made for his presentation at the Royal Geographical Society to be simulcast live to 3 million Chinese television viewers. &quot;Almost whether it&#x27;s true or not, this is a great adventure story,&quot; Bonomi told the &quot;Telegraph&quot; reporter. &quot;Gavin&#x27;s confidence and research will swing it. He is a very English eccentric and people like him often hit on truths.&quot;

Publishers immediately began courting Menzies for the publishing rights to his book. Bantam Press, a division of Transworld Publishers, offered him £500,000 for the world publishing rights to it. At this point, Menzies&#x27;s rewritten manuscript was only 190 pages. Bantam Press stated that the book possessed enormous marketing potential, but considered it to be poorly written and sloppily presented. According to Menzies, they told him, &quot;You know, if you want to get your story over, you&#x27;ve got to make it readable, and you can&#x27;t write, basically.&quot; During the revision process that followed, over 130 different people worked on the manuscript, with a large part being written by a ghostwriter named Neil Hanson. The authors relied entirely on Menzies for factual information and never brought in any fact checkers or reputable historians to make sure that the information in the book was accurate. After the rewriting process was complete, the book was at a publishable length of 500 pages.

===Publication, claims, and commercial success===

The finished copy of the book was published in 2002 as &quot;1421: The Year China Discovered the World&quot; (published as &quot;1421: The Year China Discovered America&quot; in the United States). The book is written informally, as a series of vignettes of Menzies&#x27; travels around the globe examining what he claims is evidence for his &quot;1421 hypothesis&quot;, interspersed with speculation regarding the achievements of Admiral Zheng He&#x27;s fleet. Menzies states in the introduction that the book is an attempt to answer the question: &quot;On some early European world maps, it appears that someone had charted and surveyed lands supposedly unknown to the Europeans. Who could have charted and surveyed these lands before they were &#x27;discovered&#x27;?&quot;

In the book, Menzies concludes that only China had the time, money, manpower, and leadership to send such expeditions and then sets out to prove that the Chinese visited lands unknown in either China or Europe. He claims that from 1421 to 1423, during the Ming dynasty of China under the Yongle Emperor, the fleets of Admiral Zheng He, commanded by the captains Zhou Wen, Zhou Man, Yang Qing, and Hong Bao, discovered Australia, New Zealand, the Americas, Antarctica, and the Northeast Passage; circumnavigated Greenland, tried to reach the North and South Poles, and circumnavigated the world before Ferdinand Magellan. &quot;1421&quot; instantly became an international success; it was translated into dozens of different languages and sold over a million copies. It was listed as a &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller for several weeks in 2003.

Although the book contains numerous footnotes, references, and acknowledgments, critics point out that it lacks supporting references for Chinese voyages beyond East Africa, the location acknowledged by professional historians as the limit of the fleet&#x27;s travels. Menzies bases his main theory on original interpretations and extrapolations of academic studies of minority population DNA, archaeological finds, and ancient maps. Many of these extrapolations draw on his personal nautical background without supporting evidence. Menzies claims that knowledge of Zheng He&#x27;s discoveries was subsequently lost because the mandarin bureaucrats of the Ming imperial court feared that the costs of further voyages would ruin the Chinese economy. He conjectures that when the Yongle Emperor died in 1424 and the new Hongxi Emperor forbade further expeditions, the mandarins hid or destroyed the records of previous exploration to discourage further voyages.

===Criticism===
Mainstream Sinologists and professional historians have universally rejected &quot;1421&quot; and the alternative history of Chinese exploration described in it as pseudohistory. A particular point of objection is Menzies&#x27; use of maps to argue that the Chinese mapped both the Eastern and Western hemispheres as they circumnavigated the world in the 15th century. The widely respected British historian of exploration Felipe Fernández-Armesto dismissed Menzies as &quot;either a charlatan or a cretin&quot;. Sally Gaminara, the publisher for Transworld, the company which publishes Menzies&#x27;s book, dismissed Fernández-Armesto as merely jealous, commenting, &quot;Well, maybe he&#x27;d like to have the same commercial success himself.&quot; On 21 July 2004, the Public Broadcasting System (PBS) broadcast a two-hour-long documentary debunking all of Menzies&#x27;s major claims, featuring professional Chinese historians. In 2004, historian Robert Finlay severely criticized Menzies in the &quot;Journal of World History&quot; for his &quot;reckless manner of dealing with evidence&quot; that led him to propose hypotheses &quot;without a shred of proof&quot;. Finlay wrote:

Unfortunately, this reckless manner of dealing with evidence is typical of &quot;1421&quot;, vitiating all its extraordinary claims: the voyages it describes never took place, Chinese information never reached Prince Henry and Columbus, and there is no evidence of the Ming fleets in newly discovered lands. The fundamental assumption of the book—that the Yongle Emperor dispatched the Ming fleets because he had a &quot;grand plan&quot;, a vision of charting the world and creating a maritime empire spanning the oceans—is simply asserted by Menzies without a shred of proof ... The reasoning of &quot;1421&quot; is inexorably circular, its evidence spurious, its research derisory, its borrowings unacknowledged, its citations slipshod, and its assertions preposterous ... Examination of the book&#x27;s central claims reveals they are uniformly without substance.

Tan Ta Sen, president of the International Zheng He Society, has acknowledged the book&#x27;s popular appeal as well as its scholarly failings, remarking, &quot;The book is very interesting, but you still need more evidence. We don&#x27;t regard it as an historical book, but as a narrative one. I want to see more proof. But at least Menzies has started something, and people could find more evidence.&quot;

A group of scholars and navigators—Su Ming Yang of the United States, Jin Guo-Ping and Malhão Pereira of Portugal, Philip Rivers of Malaysia, Geoff Wade of Singapore—questioned Menzies&#x27; methods and findings in a joint message:
His book &quot;1421: The Year China Discovered the World&quot;, is a work of sheer fiction presented as revisionist history. Not a single document or artifact has been found to support his new claims on the supposed Ming naval expeditions beyond Africa...Menzies&#x27; numerous claims and the hundreds of pieces of &quot;evidence&quot; he has assembled have been thoroughly and entirely discredited by historians, maritime experts and oceanographers from China, the U.S., Europe and elsewhere.

Menzies created a website for his readers to send him any information they could find that might support his hypothesis. Menzies said that his website was &quot;a focal point for ongoing research into pre-Columbian exploration of the world.&quot; In response, his devoted fans sent him thousands of pieces of purported evidence, which they claimed serve as proof that Menzies&#x27;s ideas are correct. Menzies also said that he used information his fans were sending to him to improve his hypotheses. Academics have emphatically rejected all of this &quot;evidence&quot; as worthless and have criticized what American history professor Ronald H. Fritze calls the &quot;almost cult-like&quot; manner in which Menzies drummed up support for his hypothesis. In reaction to this criticism, Menzies dismissed the experts&#x27; opinions as irrelevant, stating, &quot;The public are on my side, and they are the people who count.&quot;

A poll of History News Network readers ranked &quot;1421&quot; as the third-least credible history book in print.

==&quot;1434: The Year a Magnificent Chinese Fleet Sailed to Italy and Ignited the Renaissance&quot;==
In 2008 Menzies released a second book entitled &quot;1434: The Year a Magnificent Chinese Fleet Sailed to Italy and Ignited the Renaissance&quot;. In it Menzies claims that in 1434 Chinese delegations reached Italy and brought books and globes that, to a great extent, launched the Renaissance. He claims that a letter written in 1474 by Paolo dal Pozzo Toscanelli and found amongst the private papers of Columbus indicates that an earlier Chinese ambassador had direct correspondence with Pope Eugene IV in Rome.
Menzies then claims that materials from the Chinese &quot;Book of Agriculture&quot;, the &quot;Nong Shu&quot;, published in 1313 by the Yuan-dynasty scholar-official Wang Zhen (fl. 1290–1333), were copied by European scholars and provided direct inspiration for the illustrations of mechanical devices which are attributed to the Italian Renaissance polymaths Taccola (1382–1453) and Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519).

Felipe Fernández-Armesto, a professor of history at Tufts University in the United States and at Queen Mary, University of London, examined Menzies&#x27; claim that private papers of Columbus indicate a Chinese ambassador in correspondence with the Pope and called this claim &quot;drivel.&quot; He states that no reputable scholar supports the view that Toscanelli&#x27;s letter refers to a Chinese ambassador. Martin Kemp, Professor of the History of Art at Oxford University, questions the rigor of Menzies&#x27; application of the historical method, and in regard to European illustrations purporting to be copied from the Chinese &quot;Nong Shu&quot;, writes that Menzies &quot;says something is a copy just because they look similar. He says two things are almost identical when they are not.&quot;

In regard to Menzies&#x27; theory that Taccola&#x27;s sketches are based on Chinese information, Captain P.J. Rivers writes that Menzies contradicts himself by saying elsewhere in his book that Taccola had started his work on his technical sketches in 1431, when Zheng He&#x27;s fleet was still assembled in China, and that the Italian engineer finished his technical sketches in 1433—one year before the purported arrival of the Chinese fleet. Geoff Wade, a senior research fellow at the Asia Research Institute of the National University of Singapore, acknowledges that there was a cross exchange of technological ideas between Europe and China, but ultimately classifies Menzies&#x27; book as historical fiction and asserts that there is &quot;absolutely no Chinese evidence&quot; for a maritime venture to Italy in 1434.

Albrecht Heeffer investigated Menzies&#x27; claim that Regiomontanus based his solution to the Chinese remainder theorem on the Chinese work &quot;Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections&quot; from 1247. He arrived at the conclusion that the solution method does not depend on this text but on the earlier Sunzi Suanjing as does the treatment of a similar problem by Fibonacci which predates the &quot;Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections&quot;. Furthermore, Regiomontanus could rely on practices with remainder tables from the abacus tradition.

<doc id="357835" wikidata="Q1795223" url="?curid=357835" title="Kyōhō Reforms">
<text>The were an array of economic and cultural policies introduced by the Tokugawa shogunate between 1722–1730 during the Edo period to improve its political and social status. These reforms were instigated by the eighth Tokugawa &quot;shōgun&quot; of Japan, Tokugawa Yoshimune, encompassing the first 20 years of his shogunate. The name Kyōhō Reforms, refers to the &quot;Kyōhō&quot; period (July 1716 – April 1736).

== Purpose and scope of the reforms ==

The reforms were aimed at making the Tokugawa shogunate financially solvent, and to some degree, to improve its political and social security. Because of the tensions between Confucian ideology and the economic reality of Tokugawa Japan (Confucian principles that money was defiling versus the necessity for a cash economy), Yoshimune found it necessary to shelve certain Confucian principles that were hampering his reform process.

The Kyōhō Reforms included an emphasis on frugality, as well as the formation of merchant guilds that allowed greater control and taxation. The ban on Western books (minus those relating or referring to Christianity) was lifted to encourage the import of Western knowledge and technology.

The alternate attendance (&quot;sankin-kōtai&quot;) rules were relaxed. This policy was a burden on &quot;daimyōs&quot;, due to the cost of maintaining two households and moving people and goods between them, while maintaining a show of status and defending their lands when they were absent. The Kyōhō Reforms relieved this burden somewhat in an effort to gain support for the shogunate from the &quot;daimyōs&quot;.

==Chronology==
The shogunate&#x27;s interventions were only partly successful. Intervening factors like famine, floods and other disasters exacerbated some of the conditions which the &quot;shōgun&quot; intended to ameliorate.
* 1730 (&quot;Kyōhō 15&quot;): The Tokugawa shogunate officially recognizes the Dojima Rice Market in Osaka; and bakufu supervisors (&quot;nengyoji&quot;) are appointed to monitor the market and to collect taxes. The transactions relating to rice exchanges developed into securities exchanges, used primarily for transactions in public securities. The development of improved agriculture production caused the price of rice to fall in mid-&quot;Kyōhō&quot;.
* August 3, 1730 (&quot;Kyōhō 15, 20th day of the 6th month&quot;): A fire broke out in Muromachi and 3,790 houses were burnt. Over 30,000 looms in Nishi-jin were destroyed. The &quot;bakufu&quot; distributed rice.
* 1732 (&quot;Kyōhō 17&quot;): The Kyōhō famine was the consequence after swarms of locusts devastated crops in agricultural communities around the inland sea.

== Successive reforms ==
This reform movement was followed by three others during the Edo period: the Kansei reforms (1787–1793), the Tenpō reforms of the (1841–1843), and the Keiō reforms (1864–1867).

<text>George Baldwin Selden (September 14, 1846 – January 17, 1922) was an American patent lawyer and inventor from New York who was granted a U.S. patent for an automobile in 1895.

==Early life and career==
In 1859, his father, Judge Henry R. Selden, a prominent Republican attorney most noted for defending Susan B. Anthony, moved to Rochester, New York, where George briefly attended the University of Rochester. 

He dropped out when the American Civil War started, enlisting in the 6th Cavalry Regiment, Union Army. This was not to the liking of his father who, after pulling some strings and having some earnest discussions with his son, managed to have him released from duty and enrolled in Yale. George did not do well at Yale in his law studies, preferring the technical studies offered by the Sheffield Scientific School, but did finish his course of study and pass the New York bar in 1871. He joined his father&#x27;s practice.

He married shortly thereafter to Clara Drake Woodruff, with whom he had 4 children. He continued his hobby of inventing in a workshop in his father&#x27;s basement, inventing a typewriter and a hoop making machine.

For a time, Selden represented photography pioneer George Eastman in patent matters. He was also based in Rochester.

==The Selden patent==

He filed for a patent on May 8, 1879 (in a historical cross of people, the witness Selden chose was a local bank-teller, George Eastman, later to become famous for the Kodak camera). 

In 1899 he sold his patent rights to William C. Whitney, who proposed manufacturing electric-powered taxicabs as the Electric Vehicle Company, EVC, for a royalty of US$15 per car with a minimum annual payment of US$5,000. Whitney and Selden then worked together to collect royalties from other budding automobile manufacturers. He was initially successful, negotiating a 0.75% royalty on all cars sold by the Association of Licensed Automobile Manufacturers. He began his own car company in Rochester under the name Selden Motor Vehicle Company.

However, Henry Ford, owner of the Ford Motor Company, founded in Detroit, Michigan, in 1903, and four other car makers resolved to contest the patent infringement suit filed by Selden and EVC. The legal fight lasted eight years, generating a case record of 14,000 pages. Ford&#x27;s testimony included the comment, &quot;It is perfectly safe to say that George Selden has never advanced the automobile industry in a single particular...and it would perhaps be further advanced than it is now if he had never been born.&quot;

The case was heavily publicized in the newspapers of the day, and ended in a victory for Selden. In his decision, the judge wrote that the patent covered any automobile propelled by an engine powered by gasoline vapor. Posting a bond of US$350,000, Ford appealed, and on January 10, 1911, won his case based on an argument that the engine used in automobiles was not based on George Brayton&#x27;s engine, the Brayton engine which Selden had improved, but on the Otto engine.

This stunning defeat, with only one year left to run on the patent, destroyed Selden&#x27;s income stream. He focused production of his car company on trucks, renaming his company the Selden Truck Sales Corporation. It survived in that form until 1930 when it was purchased by the Bethlehem Motor Truck Corporation. Selden suffered a stroke in late 1921 and died aged 75 on January 17, 1922. He was buried in Mount Hope Cemetery in Rochester. It is estimated he received several hundred thousand dollars in royalties.

<doc id="357846" wikidata="Q1950413" url="?curid=357846" title="Mount Chephren">
<text>Mount Chephren is a mountain located in the Mistaya River Valley of Banff National Park, Canada.

Mount Chephren was named after Chephren, the 4th Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh. The mountain was originally named Pyramid Mountain in 1897 by J. Norman Collie, but it conflicted with an identically named peak in Jasper National Park, so it was renamed in 1924 to its present name.

==Routes==
===Scramble===
Mount Chephren is rated a difficult scramble on the south face due to its steep upper slopes with possible snow and ice difficulties. Considerable snow on the route would likely require crampons and an ice axe, thereby pushing the climb into the realm of technical mountaineering. The best conditions for scrambling would normally be late July and August.

The trail head is located at the west end of the Waterfowl Lakes campground off the Icefields Parkway in Banff National Park. The elevation gain from the trail head to the summit is .

===Technical===
There are three main routes:
* South Face/West Ridge (Normal Route) II
* East Face V 5.9 A1
* The Wild Thing VI 5.9 A3 WI4

==Geology==
Like other mountains in Banff Park, Mount Chephren is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Chephren is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Winter temperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C.

<text>Shenzhou 6 () was the second human spaceflight of the Chinese space program, launched on October 12, 2005, on a Long March 2F rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. The Shenzhou spacecraft carried a crew of Fèi Jùnlóng (费俊龙) and Niè Hǎishèng (聂海胜) for five days in low Earth orbit. It launched three days before the second anniversary of China&#x27;s first human spaceflight, Shenzhou 5.

The crew were able to change out of their new lighter space suits, conduct scientific experiments, and enter the orbital module for the first time, giving them access to toilet facilities. The exact activities of the crew were kept secret but were thought by some to include military reconnaissance, however this is likely untrue given that similar experiments in the US and USSR determined that humans in space are not suited for military reconnaissance. It landed in the Siziwang Banner of Inner Mongolia on October 16, 2005, the same site as the previous crewed and uncrewed Shenzhou flights.

== Crew ==
=== Backup Team 1 ===
=== Back-up Team 2 ===
=== Crew notes ===
This is the first spaceflight for both crew members. The crew was introduced to the Chinese public and international media about five hours before the launch. Niè Hǎishèng celebrated his 41st birthday in space.

Huang Chunping, the chief designer of the Long March 2F rocket, was quoted in the &quot;Beijing Times&quot; as saying the crew members who would fly the mission were selected from a pool of three pairs. Five pairs of astronauts trained for the flight and about one month before launch the two pairs with the lowest performance were dropped. The &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot; newspaper had reported that Zhai Zhigang and Nie Haisheng were the leading pair, after having been in the final group of three for Shenzhou 5.

== Mission highlights ==

=== Launch ===

The crew arrived at the spacecraft about 2 hours and 45 minutes before the launch and the hatch closed 30 minutes after their arrival. At 01:00:05.583 UTC on October 12 Shenzhou 6 lifted off from the launch pad at Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. The launch phase was reported to be normal with the escape rocket separating 120 seconds after launch when the rocket was travelling 1,300 m/s (4300 ft/s). Sixteen seconds later the four booster rockets separated at an altitude of . The payload fairing and first stage detached 200 seconds after launch. The second stage burned for a further 383 seconds and the spacecraft separated from the rocket above the Yellow Sea. The spacecraft then used its own propulsion system to place it into a 211 km by 345 km (131 by 214 statute miles) orbit, with an inclination of 42.4 degrees, about 21 minutes after launch. At 01:39 UTC Chen Bingde, the Chief Commander of the Chinese space program, announced the launch was successful. The crew ate their first meal in space at 03:11 UTC.

Before the flight, the launch time had been the object of speculation by the Chinese media. For several months before the planned launch its time was only given as mid-October, or even late-September. Then on September 23 it was reported by the Hong Kong-based news agency China News Service that the launch was tentatively scheduled for 03:00 UTC on October 13. This launch time was confirmed two weeks later by Jiang Jingshan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. But then on October 10 an official from the technical department of the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center said the launch was then scheduled for 01:00 UTC on October 12. This new launch time could have been designed to dodge the cold weather which had been forecast to hit the area. Assembly of the rocket was reported complete on September 26. On October 4, the Shenzhou 6 spacecraft was attached to the CZ-2F rocket, also known as &quot;Shenjian&quot;.

Unlike the uncrewed Shenzhou flights, Shenzhou 5 and 6 were launched during daylight hours to provide greater safety in case of abort. The launch was televised live with China Central Television selling advertising for RMB¥2.56 million (US$316,000) for five seconds, to RMB¥8.56 million (US$1 million) for 30 seconds. A video camera had been added to the rocket and images of it were broadcast during the ascent and the separation of the Shenzhou spacecraft.

Shortly after launch, recovery crews began searching a region from the Badain Jaran Desert in Inner Mongolia to Shaanxi for the launch escape tower, booster rockets, first stage and payload fairing. Of particular interest was the &quot;black box&quot; of the rocket, which contained telemetry that may not have been downlinked during the launch phase. It was found 45 minutes after launch somewhere near Otog Banner. It was first sighted by a herdswoman, Lian Hua, about 1.5 km from her home. Other wreckage from the launch was found and destroyed at its impact location or brought back to Jiuquan.

General Secretary and President Hu Jintao was present at the Beijing Aerospace Control Center to watch the launch. Premier Wen Jiabao was present at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.

=== Five days in orbit ===

The first of several orbit changing maneuvers happened as planned at 07:54:45, with a 63-second burn to circularize the orbit. Based on United States Space Command orbital elements, it was in a 332 by 336 km (206 by 209 statute miles) orbit. After about an hour and a half, the hatch between the re-entry and orbital modules was opened and, for the first time, crew were able to enter the second living compartment of the Shenzhou spacecraft. Fèi Jùnlóng was the first to enter, while Niè Hǎishèng remained in the reentry module. They would swap positions about three hours later.

At 13:32 UTC, Niè and Fèi had a seven-minute conversation with their wives and children who were in Mission Control. Niè&#x27;s daughter sang &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot;, as his birthday is October 13.

The activities of the crew were not fully revealed by the Chinese. Only vague references to experiments were made, though some were made public. One experiment involved the crew testing the reaction of the spacecraft to movement within the orbital and reentry modules. They moved between the modules, opening and closing the hatches and operating equipment with &quot;more strength&quot; than normally required.

A second orbital maneuver occurred at 21:56 on October 13. It raised the orbit that had been lowered due to atmospheric drag, and lasted 6.5 seconds.

On October 15, Niè and Fèi had a two-minute conversation with General Secretary and President Hu Jintao, beginning at 08:29. During the conversation, Hu told them &quot;The motherland and people are proud of you. I hope you will successfully complete your task by carrying out the mission calmly and carefully and have a triumphant return&quot;.

=== Re-entry and landing ===
The re-entry process began at 19:44 on October 16 when the orbital module separated as planned from the rest of the spacecraft. Unlike with the Soyuz spacecraft, this is done before the re-entry burn, allowing the orbital module to stay in orbit for extended months-long missions or to act as a docking target for later flights. The orbital module fired its engines twice on October 19 to give it a circular orbit with a height of .

One minute after this separation, the engines on the service module ignited over the coast of West Africa to slow the spacecraft. At 20:07, the re-entry module separated and five minutes later the re-entry proper began, as the Shenzhou capsule entered the top of the atmosphere, over China. The communications blackout that occurs during re-entry started at 20:16 and two minutes later radio communication was regained with the spacecraft. The main parachute opened and the capsule began to slowly descend to a landing on the Inner Mongolia northern grasslands at 4:33 a.m. local time (20:33 UTC). The capsule landed approximately 1 km (about 1000 yards) from its planned target.

About half an hour after landing, the recovery forces had the hatch of the spacecraft open and first Fèi, and then Niè emerged. Hou Ying, chief designer of the landing site system, said the recovery was improved over that of Shenzhou 5. After medical check-ups and a light meal the astronauts were put on a special plane bound for Beijing, where they were placed into medical isolation for the following two weeks. At 21:46, Chen Bingde had declared the entire mission to be a success.

The capsule was returned to Beijing by train and handed over to China Research Institute of Space Technology at Changping railway station.

The orbital module continued to orbit the Earth, gathering more information from experiments on board. The module also gave Chinese mission controllers experience at long-duration spaceflights. After 2,920 orbits of the Earth, its active mission ended on April 15, 2006. It is still in orbit, and will reenter when its orbit sufficiently decays.

There were two planned landing sites for the mission. The primary site was the banner of Siziwang in Inner Mongolia. The secondary site was at the Jiuquan launch site. In addition, there were recovery forces at Yinchuan, Yulin and Handan. It is also possible for the Shenzhou spacecraft to splashdown in the ocean should the need arise, with further recovery crews in the Yellow Sea, the East China Sea and the Pacific Ocean.

Some Chinese diplomats are trained and equipped for any emergency landing at sites that are not on Chinese territory. Zhang Shuting, chief designer of the emergency and rescue system, has said that emergency landing sites have been identified in Australia, Southwest Asia, North Africa, Western Europe, the United States and South America. The diplomatic mission nearest to the landing site will be given the task to head any rescue mission if necessary. The Chinese government had advised Australia that emergency landing sites have been identified in New South Wales, Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Emergency Management Australia, the Australian government agency that co-ordinates the response to major contingencies, has said they are ready to deal with any emergencies that arise during spaceflights. However, the return module is designed to allow access from the outside only to those with a special key. A copy of this key has not been made available to Australian officials, but it was reported that an unnamed Chinese military attaché at the Chinese embassy in Canberra had one.

==== Project management ====
As with previous Shenzhou series, Chinese military is heavily involved, and in official Chinese documents, project managers are referred as project commanders instead:
* General project manager / commander: Chen Bingde
* 1st vice general project manager / commander: Lieutenant General Hu Shixiang (胡世祥), vice director-general of General Armaments Department
* Vice general project manager / commander: Zhang Qingwei
* Vice general project manager / commander: Jiang Mianheng
* Vice general project manager / commander: Sun Laiyan
* General engineer: Wang Yongzhi
* Vice general engineer: Zhou Jianping (周建平), who was born in Wangcheng County, 1957. He obtained his M.S. from Dalian University of Technology, his Ph.D. from National University of Defense Technology, where he became a professor. From 1993 thru 1995, he studies in the United States. He would later become the general engineer for Shenzhou 7.
* Director of Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center: Major General Zhang Yulin (张育林)
* Vice director of Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center: Major General Cui Jijun (崔吉俊)
* General engineer of ground support at Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center: Wang Jingan (王金安)

== Upgrades ==
The Chinese space officials have said that the Long March 2F rocket featured a &quot;fire security system&quot; on the escape tower. Speculation on what this means ranges from better fail-safes to stop accidental firings, to the addition of a fire extinguisher. The &quot;Wen Wei Po&quot; newspaper have reported that the rocket appeared the same as that used for Shenzhou 5 except that a &quot;transition segment&quot; was visible at the top of the Shenzhou 6 stack, attached to one end of the orbital module.

China Aerospace Science and Technology, the major manufacturer of both the Shenzhou spacecraft and the Long March rocket have said that although the flight featured a second astronaut and was much longer than Shenzhou 5, the rocket and spacecraft did not weigh much more due to optimisation of its systems. Only 200 kg (about 440 lb) more was needed for the second astronaut. Among the amenities on board for the crew was hot food, sleeping bags and essential sanitary equipment. The sleeping bag was hooked to a wall of the orbital module and the crew had alternating sleep periods. The shock absorbers in the crew seats were redesigned so as to provide more safety to the crew in case the braking rockets fail to fire just before touchdown. The flight telemetry recorder on the spacecraft had its memory increased to about 1 gigabyte, and the read/write speed was now 10 times as fast as the computers carried on previous flights. It was also about half the size of that carried on Shenzhou 5. Overall, 95% of the Shenzhou 6 space capsule is indigenously designed/produced in China, the highest rate in comparison to the previous ones.

The menu included pineapple-filled mooncakes, green vegetables, braised bamboo shoots, rice, and bean congee. In total there was 40 kg (about 88 lb) of food on board. A somewhat strange aspect of the mission reported in the Chinese press was the fixation on the purity of drinking water for the astronauts, where it was claimed that their water reportedly comes from a mine underground and was disinfected with an electrolytic silver solution. It has thus been said by the press that they are drinking the &quot;purest water in China&quot;.

It had been reported that, on Shenzhou 5, astronaut Yang Liwei suffered from a &quot;minor heartache&quot; after his launch. It is thought that this refers to space adaptation syndrome experienced by about one third of astronauts during the first few days of a spaceflight. The &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; said that the interior design of the spacecraft has been changed to hopefully lessen the likelihood of nausea and other symptoms.

== Experiments ==
It was announced in July 2005 that Shenzhou 6 would carry one experiment involving the sperm of pigs from Rongchang County, Chongqing. But on October 11 it was revealed by Liu Luxiang, director of the Centre for Space Breeding at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, that there were no plans for animal or plant seeds on the flight. He said the focus of Shenzhou 6 was the physical reactions of the crew to the space environment. This was seemingly contradicted a year and a half after the flight when sweet potatoes started being sold for Valentine&#x27;s Day that had been grown from seeds reportedly taken on the flight.

Morris Jones who writes for SpaceDaily.com has speculated that the lack of any other announced experiments suggested that the mission could be oriented more toward the military. The crew could have operated a large surveillance film camera, supplementing the uncrewed recoverable satellite program.

== Tracking ==
There are 20 land-based tracking stations in the Chinese space telemetry network. These are supplemented by four &quot;Yuanwang&quot;-series tracking ships. The Beijing Aerospace Command and Control Center global map showed their positions to be:
* &quot;Yuanwang 1&quot; in the Yellow Sea
* &quot;Yuanwang 2&quot; about 1500 km (about 900 statute miles) southwest of French Polynesia
* &quot;Yuanwang 3&quot; off the Namibian coast
* &quot;Yuanwang 4&quot; off the coast of Western Australia in the Indian Ocean

Only one other land-based tracking station is outside China — at Swakopmund in Namibia.

Shortly after the Shenzhou 5 flight in 2003, the Pacific nation of Kiribati established diplomatic ties with the Republic of China (Taiwan), leading the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) to cut off diplomatic ties under its One-China policy. Following this, the PRC has dismantled a tracking station that had been built on Tarawa, the capital island of Kiribati, to track spaceflights.

<text>Scrambles in the Canadian Rockies is a climbing guidebook by Alan Kane describing scrambling routes of mountains in the Canadian Rockies.

It is published by Rocky Mountain Books, located in Calgary, Alberta. The third edition , released in May 2016, has been updated and contains route descriptions for 175 peaks. The peaks are rated from easy to difficult and information on trail heads and the standard routes are covered. &quot;Backpacker&quot; magazine has twice featured the book as an expedition guide. The &quot;Canadian Alpine Journal&quot; referred to it as a &quot;scree gospel&quot;. The book is solely responsible for creating a widespread interest in scrambling up mountain peaks, whether the peaks are in USA or Western Canada. Since first published in 1991, many similar guidebooks by other authors have followed this one.

<text>Dong Fang Hong 1 (), in the western world also known as China 1 or PRC 1, was the first space satellite of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), launched successfully on 24 April 1970 as part of the PRC&#x27;s Dongfanghong space satellite program. It was a part of the &quot;Two Bombs, One Satellite&quot; program. At , it was heavier than the first satellites of other countries. The satellite carried a radio transmitter which broadcast the then &quot;de facto&quot; national anthem of the same name. The broadcast lasted for 20 days while in orbit.

It was developed under the direction of Qian Xuesen, dean of the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST). At the time, a total of five identical satellites were created. The first satellite launched successfully. The academy formulated a &quot;Three-Satellite Plan&quot; consisting of &quot;Dongfanghong 1&quot;, re-entry satellites, and geosynchronous orbit communications satellites. Sun Jiadong was responsible for the &quot;Dongfanghong 1&quot; technology. In 1967, Dang Hongxin chose a copper antenna membrane that resolved the difficulties of broadcasting on an ultra-short wave antenna between 100 °C and −100 °C. Engineers installed a music player playing &quot;The East is Red&quot; on the satellite.

== Launch ==

While &quot;Dongfanghong 1&quot; was transported to the launch site by train, armed guards were placed between every two electricity poles. On 24 April 1970, at 13:35:45 GMT, a Long March 1 (CZ-1) lifted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, placing the &quot;Dongfanghong 1&quot; satellite in orbit at 13:48 GMT.

== Objectives ==
The primary purpose of the &quot;Dong Fang Hong 1&quot; satellite was to perform tests of satellite technology and take readings of the ionosphere and atmosphere.

== Satellite design ==
The satellite was similar in shape to a symmetrical 72-faced polyhedron, had a mass of , and had a diameter of approximately . It spun 120 times per minute for stabilization. The outer surface was coated with a processed aluminum alloy for temperature control. The main body of the sphere had four ultrashortwave whip antennas of at least in length. The lower section was connected to a stage containing a rocket motor. It had a shiny metallic ring added to the bottom, with brightness magnitude from +5 to +8.

== Orbit ==
The satellite was launched into orbit with a perigee of , an apogee of and inclination of 68.42°. This near-Earth elliptical orbit has an orbital period of 114.09 minutes. It has Satellite Catalog Number 04382 and International Designator 1970-034A.

&quot;Dong Fang Hong 1&quot; had a design life of 20 days. During that time, it transmitted telemetry data and space readings to the Earth. On 14 May 1970, its signal stopped.

== Reaction ==
With the successful launch of &quot;Dong Fang Hong 1&quot;, China became the fifth country after the Soviet Union, United States, France, and Japan to independently launch a satellite. Although &quot;Dong Fang Hong 1&quot; was launched nearly 13 years after &quot;Sputnik I&quot;, its mass exceeded the combined masses of the first satellites of the other four countries. After this launch, Qian Xuesen proposed to the Chinese government that China should develop a manned space program and submitted a manned space undertaking report to which Mao Zedong personally approved.

On 21 April 2005, the Chinese Academy of Space Technology gathered the science and technology personnel who participated in the design, manufacture, production, and supervision of &quot;Dong Fang Hong 1&quot;. The birthplace of &quot;Dong Fang Hong 1&quot;, the Beijing Satellite Manufacturing Plant, was used as a monument. The manufacturing plant, in coordination with the Shenzhou 5 manned spacecraft anniversary, created a 1:1 scale replica of the &quot;Dong Fang Hong 1&quot; satellite. It was exhibited in the Beijing Planetarium.

<text>A crampon is a traction device attached to footwear to improve mobility on snow and ice during ice climbing. Besides ice climbing, crampons are also used for secure travel on snow and ice, such as crossing glaciers, snowfields and icefields, ascending snow slopes, and scaling ice-covered rock. 

There are three main attachment systems: step-in, hybrid, and strap bindings. The first two require boots with welts, or specialized mountaineering boots with dedicated front and rear lugs, as a cam-action lever attaches the crampon to the heel. The last type (strap bindings) is more versatile and can adapt to virtually any boot or shoe, but often does not fit as precisely as the other two types.

Oscar Eckenstein designed the first 10-point crampon in 1908, dramatically reducing the need for step cutting. This design was then made commercially available by the Italian Henry Grivel. 

==Characteristics==


===Materials===
Crampons are made of steel alloy, lightweight aluminum, or a combination of the two. Lighter weight crampons are popular for alpine ski touring where demands are generally lower and lightweight a premium.

===Points===
Early 10-point crampons lacked forward-angled spikes and thus required step cutting on steep terrain. In the 1930s two additional forward-slanting points were added, making them exceptional for mountaineering and glacier travel and beginning a revolution in front pointing. There is currently a range of models, including specialized crampons with as many as 14 points and models with single points for ice climbing.

===Attachment===
Crampons are fastened to footwear by means of a binding system. Improved attachment systems – such as a cam action &quot;step-in&quot; system similar to a ski binding and particularly well adapted to plastic technical mountaineering boots - have widely increased crampon use. Crampons also use a full &quot;strap-in&quot; system and a &quot;hybrid&quot; binding that features a toe strap at the front and a heel lever at the back.

===Anti-balling===
To prevent snow from balling up under crampons, especially in temperatures around freezing, most models can be fitted with plastic or rubber &quot;anti-balling&quot; systems to reduce build-up. Rubber models use flexion to repel snow while plastic anti-balling plates employ a hydrophobic surface to prevent adhesion.

===Grades===
Crampons are graded C1, C2 and C3 relative to their flexibility and general compatibility with different styles of boots. No crampons are suitable for B0 boots (flexible walking boots).

==Ski crampons==
Specialized &quot;ski crampons&quot; are employed in ski mountaineering on hard snow and ice. Far more common in the Alps than in the United States, these ski crampons are known by their European names: &quot;Harscheisen&quot; (German), &quot;couteaux&quot; (French) and &quot;coltelli&quot; (Italian), literally French and Italian for &quot;knives&quot; in those languages.

== Microspikes ==
While crampons generally have a solid frame, and large spikes, and may only be attached to a mountaineering boot, microspikes typically are flexible rubber or metal chains with more, smaller spikes. Since crampons are tighter and have larger spikes, they are typically used for mountaineering on steep and dense snow or glacial ice in order to maintain strong traction and avoid falls, whereas microspikes may be attached to multiple types of shoes and are generally used for hiking on flatter surfaces such as snow or even gravel or dirt.

==Heel spurs==
Heel spurs are a type of crampon that attaches to the back of the heel and allow mixed climbers to perform heel hooks. They are a source of controversy, however, with some regarding the use of heel spurs as being a form of aid climbing, and not free climbing.

<doc id="357855" wikidata="Q5943312" url="?curid=357855" title="Hunger circus">
<text>&quot;Hunger circus&quot; () was a colloquial name for any in a series of identical buildings which were to be completed as part of President Nicolae Ceaușescu&#x27;s program of systematization during his period as ruler of Romania. Officially designated by the communist regime as &quot;complex agroalimentar&quot; ( Complex), these large domed buildings were intended as produce markets and public refectories. It appears to have been Ceauşescu&#x27;s vision that they would serve as food distribution centres, eliminating the need for selling or distributing food anywhere else.

The name &quot;hunger circuses&quot;, now so universally used as to have almost suppressed the memory of the official communist-era term, derived from the circus-like domed architecture and the irony of constructing these massive food-related buildings during a period when food was scarce throughout Romania, due to Ceaușescu&#x27;s policy of exporting most of Romania&#x27;s agricultural produce in order to pay off the foreign debt. The irony was reinforced by the connotation of &quot;circus&quot; as ridiculous farce.

At the time of Ceaușescu&#x27;s downfall and execution, only two hunger circuses had been completed: One of these, Pantelimon, now forms part of a public market in the Delfinului area of Bucharest; the other, also in Bucharest, is placed close to the Unirea shopping mall, nestled between Piața Unirii and Sfânta Vineri Street. Several others stood half-finished in scattered locations around Bucharest, surrounded by rusting construction cranes and vacant lots.

The hunger circuses left unfinished after the 1989 Revolution were later completed, as malls such as the Bucharest Mall in Vitan, City Mall and Plaza Romania in Militari. The &quot;hunger circus&quot; in Rahova was partially demolished in November 2006 to make room for a new mall – Liberty Center Mall. Another hunger circus was transformed into a private university.

<doc id="357857" wikidata="Q2419126" url="?curid=357857" title="Theophilus Eaton">
<text>Theophilus Eaton (January 7, 1658) was a wealthy New England Puritan merchant, diplomat and financier, who took part in organizing and financing the Great Puritan Migration to America. He was a founder of Massachusetts Bay Colony, and a founder and eventual governor of New Haven Colony. He also cofounded Boston, Massachusetts, Greenwich, Connecticut and Eaton&#x27;s Neck in New York.

His brother, Nathaniel Eaton, became the first headmaster of Harvard college, building Harvard Yard and Harvard Library, and his son, Samuel Eaton, became one of the seven founders of the Harvard Corporation.

==Early life and first marriage==

He was born at Stony Stratford, Buckinghamshire, England about 1590, to Rev. Richard Eaton and his wife, Elizabeth. His father was a graduate of the University of Oxford in 1599, at Lincoln College, and may have been the curate at that time. He later became in 1607 Prebendary of Lincoln Cathedral and Vicar of Great Budworth, Cheshire. Theophilus married Grace Hiller, and had two daughters, Mary and Elizabeth Eaton, who died young. Grace Hiller died in 1626.

==Second marriage and children==

In 1627 he remarried, this time to a widow, Anne Yale, who was the daughter of George Lloyd, the Bishop of Chester (some authorities say Anne Morton, the daughter of Bishop Thomas Morton of Chester). Eaton and Anne Yale were the parents of Samuel Eaton (baptized in 1628), Theophilus Jr., Hannah, Jonathan and Elizabeth II (b. 1637), as the previous Elizabeth Eaton died in 1630. They raised eight children in their household. Besides their three, and Mary and Samuel, it included Anne, David, and Thomas Yale from Anne&#x27;s first marriage to Thomas Yale of the Yale family. Thomas Yale was a London merchant, son of Dr. David Yale of Erddig Park, Chancellor of Chester, who was the nephew of Dr. Thomas Yale, Chancellor of the Head of the Church of England and a cousin of Elizabeth Tudor. He was also a grandson of John Lloyd, Judge of the High Court of Admiralty in London, and one of the eight founding Fellows of the first Protestant College of the University of Oxford, Jesus College. Another cousin was Rev. John Yale of Cambridge University, heir of Plas-yn-Yale in Wales.

The three Yale children all had notable places in the history of Connecticut.

Thomas Yale Jr. settled in Connecticut as a planter and landowner, cofounded New Haven Colony, and signed its Fundamental Agreement on June 4, 1639. His descendants would fight the American War of Independence and other wars, as general, colonels, majors, captains and soldiers, and become the early settlers of Wallingford and Yalesville, with many also becoming postmasters for Presidents Jackson, Van Buren, Polk, Pierce, and Buchanan, as well as establishing a manufacturing dynasty in the region. They would establish number of hotels and banks and start the manufacture of cigars, beer, pelts, wagons, carriages, steamboats, ships, yacht flags, gunpowder engines, Britannia ware, as well as bayonets and muskets for the Revolutionary War, Mexican War, Crimean War, and would later be behind the majority of the weapons manufactured for the Union Army of Abraham Lincoln through Lamson, Goodnow &amp; Yale, family of Linus Yale Sr..

Notable descendants include : Gen. Edwin R. Yale, proprietor of the largest hotel in America, Senator Charles Dwight Yale, co-proprietor of Simpson, Hall, Miller &amp; Co., Meriden&#x27;s largest manufacturer, William Yale, yachtman Charles G. Yale, family cofounded the N.Y. Stock Exchange, media entrepreneur and banker Moses Yale Beach, largest newspaper in America, Helen Wakefield Yale, wife of Judge John H. Kennard, Elizur Yale Smith, one of the largest paper manufacturer, family of Rev. Elisha Yale and Gabriel Mead Tooker of Mrs. Astor&#x27;s Four Hundred, Mary Yale Ogden, family of abolitionist Barnabas Yale and Lorenzo Da Ponte, partner of Mozart and founder of the first Italian opera in Manhattan, Dr. Leroy Milton Yale Jr., family of Congressman Chester W. Chapin, Eliza Yale, family of Lt. Gov. Julius Catlin, Mary Valentine Yale Bissell, family of George Henry Bissell, founder of the American oil industry and competitor of John D. Rockefeller and the Rothschilds, Donald Arthur Yale, co-owner of Borsheims with Warren Buffett, etc.

Anne Yale (the daughter) married Gov. Edward Hopkins in 1631; he later became the 2nd Gov. of Connecticut and a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty for the Lord Protector of Britain, Oliver Cromwell. Her uncle-in-law was Ottoman ambassador Sir Henry Lello, who negotiated with the Venetians and Habsburgs under Elizabeth Tudor. David Yale, a prosperous Boston merchant and attorney to Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick, who married Ursula Knight in 1641, became the father of Gov. Elihu Yale, President of the British East India Company settlement in Fort St. George, at Madras and primary benefactor of Yale College.

The Eaton children fared as follows. Daughter Mary Eaton married Judge Valentine Hill of Boston, a business associate of William Aspinwall, member of the Artillery Company, signatory of the Oath of a Freeman and real estate developer in 1647. (Gov. Eaton&#x27;s brother, Nathaniel Eaton, the first Headmaster of Harvard and builder of Harvard&#x27;s first College was present as a witness.) Samuel Eaton became one of the seven founding members and signatories of the Harvard Corporation by charter in 1650, then, in 1654, married Mabel (Harlakenden) Haynes, widow of John Haynes, 4th Gov. of Massachusetts Bay Colony and later 1st Gov. of Connecticut Colony. Both of them died in the small pox epidemic of 1655. Hannah Eaton married William Jones, 24th Lt. Gov. of Connecticut and Magistrate for the United Colonies, in 1659. He and Davenport hosted in secret two regicides from Britain in the Judges&#x27; Cave in New Haven. Theophilus Eaton, Jr., or Ellis, as he was known, returned to England with his mother after his father&#x27;s death, settled in Dublin, Ireland, and married Catherine (daughter of Captain Thomas Maunsell and Alphra Crayford) in 1649, and their daughter Anne married her first cousin Colonel Thomas Maunsell. He is ancestor to many members of prominent Anglo-Irish families to this day. Their daughter Elizabeth died in London in March 1637 before the family departed for the colonies.

==Early career in England==
In London, Theophilus resided between Coleman Street and Lothbury Street, and became a member of the Court of Common Council of the City of London Corporation. He purchased with Anne Yale the past home of Sir Richard Saltonstall of the Saltonstall family. For several years, he served as Ambassador and middleman between King James I of England and King Christian IV of Denmark, mostly for the business dealings between these two countries.

Thereafter, he would become Deputy Gov. of the Eastland Company, which was one of the most important English commercial companies of the 17th century. The enterprise traded in the Baltics and Scandinavia, dealing with countries such as Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Prussia and Poland. As his wealth grew, he took great interest in the plans to colonize New England. He would get his chance in 1628. He and a group of shareholders, including Sir Richard Saltonstall and Sir Henry Rosewell, bought the right to colonize the Massachusetts Bay Colony, through a Royal charter made by King Charles I of England.

As one of the cofounders of Massachusetts, he signed its incorporation called the Charter of the Massachusetts Bay Company and they would form a Self-governing colony by creating the Massachusetts General Court, called the Great and General Court at the time and the Massachusetts Governor&#x27;s Council, called the Council of assistants at the time. This governing body would put the management and defence of the colony in the hands of ten men. Five would have to stay in England, five would go to Massachusetts. Theophilus was one of the five men chosen to govern the Colony from England. To make the trip to the Massachusetts Bay Colony, Governor John Winthrop would use one of the ships that he co-owned, the Arbella, and would make it his flagship to lead the Winthrop Fleet.

Arrived in Massachusetts, they would make Boston their capital, with Theophilus Eaton and Thomas Hooker among its founders. This would start the Puritan migration to New England (1620–1640) and Theophilus would be one of those wealthy city Puritans who financed it. The colony became the largest in New England, and evolved into the Thirteen American Colonies that would later become the United States of America.

==Emigration to New England==
He later made the trip and emigrated to New England with other Puritans in the ship &quot;Hector&quot;, arriving in Boston on June 26, 1637.

His group of colonists had his friend John Davenport as their religious leader, brother of Francis Davenport, the chaplain of Queen Catherine of Braganza and Henrietta Maria de Bourbon. They wanted to start their own settlement – probably due in part to the commanding persona of John Winthrop, Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony at the time (1637 to 1640, and many other terms). Winthrop was termed &quot;an object of great fear in all the colonies&quot;, and caused the Rev. Thomas Hooker and others to go off and form their own colonies as well.

Their beliefs seemed quite strong in retrospect as they would later refuse the request of Oliver Cromwell, the most powerful man in England, to join him in his conquest of Ireland and Spain.

==Foundation of New Haven==

In the spring his group moved from Boston and when they arrived on April 14, 1638, they named the site New Haven. That fall, Eaton led an exploration to the south, and located a site at Quinnipiack on the northern shore of Long Island Sound. On November 14, 1638, he and his company entered into an agreement with the chief sachem Momauquin agreeing that in exchange for protection from the Quinnipiack Indians&#x27; ancient enemies, the Mohawk and the Pequot, Momauquin would relinquish his right, title, and interest to the lands that both parties agreed would not later evolve into feelings of animosity, hate, or regret. [Cf. J. W. Barber, &quot;History and Antiquities of New Haven, (Conn.)&quot; (1831) pp. 25–29].

The Mohawks and the Pequots had all but wiped out the New Haven Indians, leaving but 40 surviving males, and to that end Theophilus and his company also covenanted to protect them when unreasonably assaulted and terrified, that they would always have a sufficient quantity of land to plant on, and by way of free and thankful retribution that they give to the sachem and his council and company: twelve coats of English cloth, twelve alchemy spoons, twelve hatchets, twelve hoes, two dozen knives, twelve porringers, and four cases of French knives &amp; scissors.

This agreement was signed and legally executed by Momauquin and his council as well as by Theophilus Eaton and John Davenport.

Some still say, however, that Theophilus simply traded thirteen coats to the local Indians for seven townships of land; but what is a fact is that in the following December 1638 he and his company did also purchase the usage of a large area of land from Monotowese, son of the sachem at Mattabeseck, which was 10 miles in length and 13 in breadth. He did pay 13 coats to Monotowese as per their agreement, but again, the English gave the Indians ample grounds to plant on and free usage of all the lands for hunting. Further, even though Monotowese&#x27;s tribe consisted of but 10 males with their women and children, it was understood that the English would also protect them from the Mohawk and the Pequots.

Upon arrival in the new colony, Theophilus at first attempted to resume his trade as a merchant.
He was not successful, however, since the colony was too new to afford imports and the Indian fur trade was more successful at the Dutch outposts at Hartford, so he soon turned to farming. When the New Haven Colony established its administration, he was chosen as one of the &quot;seven pillars of the church&quot; acting as one of the 7 councillors who formed the body of freemen and elected civil officers. Their names were: Theophilus Eaton, John Davenport, Robert Newman, Matthew Gilbert, Thomas Fugill, John Punderson, and Jeremiah Dixon. The colony would over time have outposts in Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New York, including territories on Long Island such as Eaton&#x27;s Neck and Southold, next to the Hamptons and Gardiners Island of Lion Gardiner.

==Career as governor==

He was elected as the first governor on June 4, 1639, and reelected each year until his death on January 7, 1657/8 (Julian Calendar timing). He was buried on the green in New Haven and later his remains were removed to Grove Street Cemetery, New Haven. One of his major accomplishments as governor was the creation of a written legal code for the colony in 1655 later to be known as the Blue Laws of Connecticut. For this, and the fact that he was the first president of the Massachusetts Bay Company, he is sometimes thought of as being the Father of American Law, but this is arguably an example of hyperbole.

In 1640, as Governor of the Colony, he acquired from the Siwanoy Indians the town of Greenwich, Connecticut, making him one of its founder. Around 1642, he established the Delaware Company of New Haven, a permanent colony in the Delaware River Valley with the aim of developing the fur trade against the Dutch. Stephen Goodyear of the Goodyear family and other merchants joined the venture. Their claim on this territory brought conflicts with Dutch Governor Willem Kieft and Lord Baltimore of Maryland Colony.

In 1643, he became a founding Commissioner of the United Colonies of New England, and was joined by his son-in-law, Governor Edward Hopkins, the 2nd Governor of Connecticut Colony, to unite the Church and build a military alliance between the New England Colonies. In 1646, he became the first in New England to freed his slaves, more than 100 years before the 1st U.S. President George Washington and Founding Father Benjamin Franklin doing the same. In 1650, he became involved in one of the many disputes with Gov. Peter Stuyvesant, of the Stuyvesant family, over the boundaries of the colonies, adding tension to the Anglo-Dutch relations.

The dispute with New Amsterdam concerned the Dutch claims on all the lands bordering Long Island Sound, and the capture of an English ship. Gov. Winthrop got involved and they settled the borders of New Netherland and the English colonies over the Treaty of Hartford. In 1653, he sent his secretary, Francis Newman, to meet Governor Peter Stuyvesant to gain compensation for the English settlers who were in Dutch hands. In 1654, when Davenport became sick, Eaton had the physician of Oliver Cromwell, Dr. Laurence Wright, and Gov. Winthrop, to take the case in their own hands and send him back to England to be cured. In 1656, he received a letter from Cromwell, at the time Lord Protector (head of state), formally inviting the residents of New Haven Colony to remove to Jamaica, or later Ireland, along with another letter from Maj. Gen. Robert Sedgwick, to which they declined. Mr. Newman would replace Theophilus Eaton as Governor after his death in 1658, with Stephen Goodyear of the Goodyear family as his Deputy Governor.

Eaton&#x27;s Neck, New York, on Long Island, a peninsula 45 miles from Manhattan, also bear his name. He acquired the land in 1646 from the Matinecock Indians and was the first European to have explored this area. As part of the estate of Gov. Eaton and Anne Yale, the 1500 acres property was inherited by their son, Theophilus Jr., then their daughter Hannah Eaton, the half-siblings of the Yales. In 1686, it became one of the six royal manors of Long Island, becoming The Lordship and Manor of Eaton&#x27;s Neck. It was granted by Governor Thomas Dongan on behalf of King James II of England, the famous Duke of York who gave his name to the Province and City of New York.

==Siblings==

Theophilus&#x27; younger brother Nathaniel Eaton (1609–1674) was the first Headmaster of Harvard College, and the brother-in-law of Gov. William Stone, family of Founding Fathers Thomas Stone and Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer. He was deposed in 1639 by the then Governor John Winthrop in what some have considered to be Massachusetts&#x27; first Witch Trial. Another brother, Samuel Eaton Sr. (1597–1665), was a Minister who accompanied Theophilus to New Haven, but later returned to England.

Theophilus was a member of the Great and General Court of the Massachusetts Bay Colony when they issued the charter for Harvard. He also gave £40 for the erection of Harvard&#x27;s first buildings while his brother Nathaniel Eaton was erecting them as superintendent of the college. Governor Eaton, his brother Nathaniel, the first Head, and his son Samuel Jr., one of the seven founders of the Harvard Corporation, were all participants in the founding of Harvard College.

Samuel was admitted at Harvard in 1645, and graduated from a class of five in 1649, before its incorporation in 1650, and began teaching at the institution, just as his uncle Nathaniel was teaching at its foundation. His stepson also attended Harvard. Nathaniel was a friend of John Harvard who came with him from Cambridge University to the colonies.

Theophilus Eaton&#x27;s home was the largest in New Haven Colony, and one of the largest in New England at the time, with a total of 21 fireplaces, a household of about 30 people, and an estate covering 3000 acres in New Haven. He also had estates in London and England. The home of Eli Whitney of the Whitney family, now called William Pinto House, would later be on the original estate of Gov. Eaton.

<text>Dongfanghong () was a satellite program of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The program started in August 1965 as Project 651—a less ambitious successor to the earlier Project 581—with the goal of launching a satellite heavier than both Sputnik 1 and Explorer 1 into space, and developing all the necessary technologies to do so.

== History ==
In 1958, the Chinese Academy of Science proposed Project 581 which included a plan to launch a satellite into space before 1 October 1959. The project was troubled due to the country&#x27;s lack of expertise in the field of rocketry. On 21 January 1959, Zhang Jingfu, who was in charge in the satellite research program, postponed the project to allow effort to be put into developing more basic technologies, such as sounding rocketry. In December 1964, during the 3rd National People&#x27;s Congress, Zhao Jiuzhang suggested that the work on satellites be resumed. In August 1968, the Central Special Committee approved Chinese Academy of Science&#x27;s plan, which later became Project 651.

In June 1965, the Central Special Committee made the decision to pursue development of a launch vehicle. As per the request of Commission for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense (COSTIND), the vehicle&#x27;s first stage and second stage would be based on a DF-4 long range missile. A solid-fueled third stage was added to the design.

On 24 April 1970, Dong Fang Hong 1 was launched. After reaching orbit, it transmitted a tone-generator rendition of the Chinese song &quot;The East is Red&quot; for 28 days.

===Effect on the name of the Soviet Salyut programme===
According to Boris Chertok&#x27;s memoirs, when the first Soviet space station, Salyut 1, was under construction, its designated name was &quot;Zarya&quot; (which means &quot;Dawn&quot;, in Russian). When the Soviets realized that the Chinese had a space program with a similar name (&quot;Dongfanghong&quot; was also rendered as &quot;Zarya&quot; into Russian), they renamed their space station to &quot;Salyut&quot; (&quot;Firework&quot;), to avoid confusion.

==Later iterations==
Dongfanghong satellite program later developed satellite bus to use the base platform and structure for other Chinese satellites and spacecraft.

===DFH-2===

DFH-2 is the first-generation, spin-stabilized large satellite bus from China, developed in the late 1970s. The first launch was in 1984.

===DFH-3===
DFH-3 is the second-generation 3-axis stabilized, large satellite bus from China, developed in 1987. It could be used for geosynchronous communications and navigation satellites, and deep space exploration.

===DFH-4===
DFH-4 is the third-generation, 3-axis stabilized, large satellite bus developed by China. The satellite bus was designed and developed from 1999 to 2005. The maiden flight was launched on 29 October 2006. The satellite bus had first international customer in 2007.

===DFH-5===
DFH-5 is the fourth-generation, 3-axis stabilized, satellite bus developed by China. First satellite was operational in 2017.

<doc id="357859" wikidata="Q816762" url="?curid=357859" title="Ice axe">
<text>An ice axe is a multi-purpose hiking and climbing tool used by mountaineers in both the ascent and descent of routes that involve snow or ice covered (e.g. ice climbing or mixed climbing) conditions. Its use depends on the terrain: in its simplest role it is used like a walking stick, with the mountaineer holding the head in the center of their uphill hand. On steep terrain it is swung by its handle and embedded in snow or ice for security and an aid to traction. It can also be buried pick down, the rope tied around the shaft to form a secure anchor on which to bring up a second climber, or buried vertically to form a stomp belay. The adze is used to cut footholds, as well as scoop out compacted snow to bury the axe as a belay anchor. 

== History ==
The ice axe of today has its roots in the long-handled alpenstock that came before it. Not only is an ice axe used as a climbing aid, but also as a means of self-arrest in the event of a slip downhill.

Most ice axes meet design and manufacturing standards of organizations such as the Union Internationale des Associations d&#x27;Alpinisme (UIAA) or European Committee for Standardization (CEN). There are two classifications of ice axe, Basic (B/Type 1) and Technical (T/Type 2). 

* Basic ice axes are designed for use in snow conditions for general mountaineering, and are adequate for basic support and self-arrest. Technical ice axes, which may have curved shafts, are strong enough to be used for steep or vertical ice climbing and belaying on such ground.
* Specialized scaled-down ice axes used for vertical ice climbing are known as ice tools. Ice tools have shorter and more curved shafts; stronger, sharper, and more curved replaceable picks, and often ergonomic grips and finger rests. Used in a pair, one is usually equipped with an adze for chipping and clearing snow whilst the other has a hammer to aid gear placement.

For ski mountaineering and racing, where weight is of paramount concern, manufacturers have produced short (~) and light () ice axes. Some of these have aluminum alloy heads/picks which are unlikely to be as effective or robust as steel heads/picks.

==Components==
An ice axe consists of at least five components:
*Head – usually made of steel and featuring a pick and adze. A hole in the center is provided for attaching a wrist leash or carabiner.
*Pick — the toothed pointed end of the head, typically slightly curved (aiding both in ergonomics and self-arrest).
*Adze — the flat, wide end of the head used for chopping steps in hard snow and ice.
*Hammer — the hammer is an alternative to the adze. May be used for aiding placement of protection.
*Shaft — straight or slightly angled, typically wider front-to-back than side-to-side, flat on the sides and smoothly rounded on the ends. Traditional shafts were made of wood, but are now almost exclusively of lightweight metals (such as aluminum, titanium and steel alloys) or composites (including fiberglass, Kevlar or carbon filament).
*Spike, or ferrule — a point at the base of the shaft used for balance and safety when the axe is held by its head in walking stick fashion. Usually made of steel.

==Accessories==

Ice axe accessories include:
*Leash – nylon webbing with an adjustable loop for securing the axe to hand. Often secured by a ring constrained to slide a limited distance on the shaft.
*Leash stop – a rubber keeper or metal stud preventing the leash from slipping off of the ice axe.
*Snow basket – similar to baskets on ski poles, temporarily mounted on the shaft close to the spike to keep the shaft from sinking into soft snow. Not at all common in Europe.
*Pick and adze guard – a cover to protect from sharp edges and points when the axe is not being used.
*Spike guard – a cover to protect from the sharp spike when the axe is not being used.

==Size==
Ice-axe spike-to-head lengths used to generally range from . This is just too short to be used as a walking stick on level ground (the way its forebear, the 19th century alpenstock, was), but is ergonomic when ascending steep slopes. For flatter ground, where consequences of a slip are not large, walking poles are more appropriate.

The old method to approximate the correct length of an ice axe was for the climber to hold the axe (spike facing the ground) at his/her side while standing relaxed. The spike of the ice axe should barely touch the ground when the climber stands fully upright holding the axe in this manner. This may still be appropriate when the ice axe is to be used on relatively flat ground, most likely in glacier travel.

Modern mountaineers often carry shorter ice axes , for general use, with anything over typically regarded as too large and unwieldy for chopping steps or climbing steep snow. A walking pole (providing a third point of contact), although stabilising and making a slip less likely, is unlikely to stop a fall.

== History ==

The antecedent of the ice axe was the alpenstock, a long wooden pole with an iron spike tip, used by shepherds for travel on snowfields and glaciers in the Alps since the Middle Ages. On 8 August 1786, Jacques Balmat and Michel-Gabriel Paccard made the first ascent of Mont Blanc. Balmat, a chamois hunter and crystal collector, had experience with high mountain travel, and Paccard had made previous attempts to climb the peak. Illustrations show Balmat carrying two separate tools that would later be merged into the ice axe – an alpenstock (or baton) and a small axe that could be used to chop steps on icy slopes.

According to the earliest manufacturer of ice axes, Grivel, these two tools were merged to create the first true ice axe around 1840. Early ice axes had a vertical adze, with the cutting edge aligned with the direction of the shaft, as in a conventional axe. This design lasted until at least 1860, but eventually the adze was rotated to the current position, perpendicular to the direction of the shaft. The Italian Alpine Club published a book in 1889 entitled &quot;Fiorio e Ratti – The dangers of mountaineering and rules to avoid them&quot;, which recommended ice axes as among &quot;the inseparable companions of the mountaineer&quot;.

In the late 19th century, the typical ice axe shaft measured in length. British climber Oscar Eckenstein started the trend toward shorter ice axes with a lighter model measuring . Initially, this innovation was criticized by well-known climbers of the era, including Martin Conway, a prominent member of the Alpine Club, who was the leader of an early expedition to the Baltoro region near K2 in 1892 of which Eckenstein was a member.

Early ice axes had picks and adzes of about equal lengths. By the beginning of the 20th century, the pick lengthened to about twice the length of the adze. Improvements in crampon design (pioneered by Eckenstein in 1908) and ice climbing technique led to use of shorter, lighter ice axes appropriate to steeper ice climbs in the period between the world wars.

A famous rescue involving an ice axe took place during the Third American Karakoram Expedition to K2 in 1953. One of the climbers, Art Gilkey, was incapacitated by thrombophlebitis. The other climbers attempted to rescue him by lowering him down the mountain by rope, wrapped in a sleeping bag. While crossing a steep ice sheet, a slip caused Gilkey and five other climbers to begin falling down a steep slope. Climber Pete Schoening wedged his ice axe alongside a boulder, and managed to belay the roped climbers, saving their lives. (Gilkey, however, later in the same descent was swept away by an avalanche. Remains of his lost corpse were discovered in 1993.) Schoening&#x27;s ice axe is now on display at the Bradford Washburn American Mountaineering Museum in Golden, Colorado.

In 1966, Yvon Chouinard led a significant redesign of ice axes, working with initially reluctant manufacturer Charlet to develop a ice axe with a dramatically curved pick. Chouinard believed that &quot;a curve compatible with the arc of the axe&#x27;s swing would allow the pick to stay put better in the ice. I had noticed that a standard pick would often pop out when I placed my weight on it.&quot; Chouinard&#x27;s idea worked and began a period of innovation in ice axe design.

In 1978, the Safety Commission of the Union Internationale des Associations d&#x27;Alpinisme (UIAA) established formal standards for ice axe safety and performance. This led to the replacement of the traditional wooden shaft by metal alloy shafts. Ergonomically curved handles became widespread in 1986. Use of modern aluminum alloys have led to a dramatic reduction in the weight of some ice axes. One model now on the market, the C.A.M.P. Corsa, weighs only with a shaft. One expert rated this lightweight ice axe as &quot;ideal for low angle glacier travel&quot; but said he &quot;craved the solid and secure heft of a true steel mountain ax&quot; in more demanding steep alpine conditions.

==Attachment to a pack==
When not in use an ice axe is stored on the outside of a pack (rucksack). Many models come with a nylon webbing loop sewn on its rear base (off to one side to allow the pick to stay behind the hiker), together with a means to restrain its shaft. Rucksacks with attachment points for two ice axes are also available, popular in ice climbing where two tools are used.

<text>Kʼinich Kan Bahlam II (), also known as Chan Bahlum II, (May 23, 635 – February 20, 702) was &quot;ajaw&quot; of the Maya city-state of Palenque, in what is now the state of Chiapas, Mexico. He acceded to the throne in January, 684, several months after the death of his father and predecessor, Kʼinich Janaabʼ Pakal and ruled until his death.

==Biography==
He continued the ambitious project of adorning Palenque with fine art and architecture begun by his father; his most important addition to the city of Palenque was the Temple of the Cross which is the center piece of the Temple of the Cross Complex. He was succeeded by his younger brother, Kʼinich Kʼan Joy Chitam II, another brother was probably Tiwol Chan Mat. The monuments and text associated with Kʼinich Kan Bahlam II are: Tablets and Alfardas of the Temples of the Cross, Sun and Foliated Cross; tablets and facade of the Temple of the Inscriptions; Temple 17 Panel; Death&#x27;s Head; Jonuta Panel; Temple of the Cross Stela.

<text>Robert Lee Hatfield (August 10, 1940 – November 5, 2003) was an American singer. He and Bill Medley were the Righteous Brothers. He sang the tenor part for the duo and sang solo on the group&#x27;s 1965 recording of &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, Hatfield moved with his family to Anaheim, California, when he was four. He attended Anaheim High School, where he played football and baseball and was co-captain of the basketball team. He was student body president in the 1957–1958 school year, graduating in 1958.

=== Baseball ===
Hatfield was scouted by the Los Angeles Dodgers. He briefly considered signing as a professional ballplayer, but his passion for music led him to pursue a singing career while still attending high school. He attended Fullerton College.

He eventually encountered his singing partner, Bill Medley, while attending California State University, Long Beach. Hatfield was an alumnus of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity.

==Career==
Bobby Hatfield initially was in a group from Anaheim called the Variations.

=== Paramours: 1962–1963 ===
In 1962, Hatfield joined with Medley, who was in a group called the Paramours, and formed a five-member group using the same name: &quot;Paramours&quot;. They first performed at a club called John&#x27;s Black Derby in Santa Ana. They were signed to a small record label Moonglow in 1962. They released a single &quot;There She Goes (She&#x27;s Walking Away)&quot; in December 1962. However, the Paramours did not have much success and soon broke up, leaving Hatfield and Medley to perform as a duo in 1963.

=== The Righteous Brothers: 1963–1968 ===

Later, Hatfield and Medley performed as a duo and named their singing act The Righteous Brothers. They were often told they sounded like African-American gospel singers and chose the name after black Marines remarked of their singing, &quot;that&#x27;s righteous, brothers&quot; and called them &quot;righteous brothers&quot;. Their first charted single as the Righteous Brothers was &quot;Little Latin Lupe Lu&quot; released under the label Moonglow Records, and they appeared regularly on the television show &quot;Shindig!&quot;

In 1964, they appeared in a show at the Cow Palace near San Francisco and met the music producer Phil Spector, whose group The Ronettes was also in the show. Spector was impressed and signed them to his own label Philles Records. Their first No. 1 was &quot;You&#x27;ve Lost That Lovin&#x27; Feelin&#x27;,&quot; produced by Phil Spector in 1964. Follow-up hits included &quot;Unchained Melody,&quot; which was actually a Hatfield solo performance. After the success of &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;, Spector then started recording older standards with the Righteous Brothers such as &quot;Ebb Tide&quot;, which Hatfield also performed solo, and it reached the Top 5. Both &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; and &quot;Ebb Tide&quot; were songs he had performed with his first group, the Variations. Another two of the last songs the duo recorded with Philles Records, &quot;The White Cliffs of Dover&quot; and &quot;For Sentimental Reasons&quot;, were performed solo by Hatfield.

In 1966, the Righteous Brothers left Spector and signed with Verve/MGM Records, and had a hit with &quot;(You&#x27;re My) Soul and Inspiration&quot;. However the duo broke up in 1968, and Hatfield teamed with singer Jimmy Walker (from The Knickerbockers) using the Righteous Brothers name on the MGM label. The new partnership released an album but did not have much success.

=== Solo career ===
Hatfield recorded a number of singles as a solo artist. In 1963, Hatfield released an uncharted single, &quot;Hot Tamales&quot;/&quot;I Need a Girl&quot; on Moonglow Records. He released the self-penned &quot;Hang Ups&quot; and covers of older songs, but &quot;Only You&quot; was his only charted single, peaking at No. 95. In 1969, Hatfield also appeared in the TV movie &quot;The Ballad of Andy Crocker&quot;.

In 1971, he released a solo album, &quot;Messin&#x27; in Muscle Shoals&quot;, recorded at the FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals in August 1970. However, MGM was in financial trouble, a scheduled single &quot;The Promised Land&quot;/&quot;Woman You Got No Soul&quot; was not released, and with little promotion the album largely went unnoticed.

=== Reunion ===
Hatfield and Medley reunited in 1974, and had another hit, the No. 3 &quot;Rock and Roll Heaven.&quot; A hiatus followed between 1976 and 1981 when Medley retired from music after his ex-wife died, but they reunited for an anniversary special on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; in 1981 to perform an updated version of &quot;Rock and Roll Heaven&quot;.

In 1990, after the success of the film &quot;Ghost&quot; in which &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; was used, Hatfield re-recorded the song and remarked to friends that he had not lost any of the high notes in his tenor range since the original recording, but had actually gained one note. The duo then toured extensively all through the 1990s and early 2000s.

The Righteous Brothers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2003 by Billy Joel.

==Personal life==
Hatfield had a short marriage with Joy Ciro, who appeared as a dancer on the &quot;T.A.M.I. Show&quot; and &quot;Where the Action Is&quot;. They had two children, Bobby, Jr. and Kalin. Hatfield married Linda Torrison on August 4, 1979, and they remained married until his death. Linda suffered from lupus, and Hatfield set up an annual golf tournament, the Bobby Hatfield Charity Golf Classic, to raise funds for charities for the disease. The couple had two children, Vallyn and Dustin.

==Death==
Hatfield died at the Radisson Hotel in downtown Kalamazoo, Michigan, on November 5, 2003. He was found by Bill Medley and the Righteous Brothers&#x27; road manager Dusty Hanvey. A security guard let them into Hatfield&#x27;s room after he had failed to show up at the concert venue when expected. He apparently died in his sleep, hours before a scheduled Righteous Brothers concert. In January 2004, a toxicology report concluded that cocaine use had precipitated a fatal heart attack. The initial autopsy found that Hatfield had advanced coronary disease. The medical examiner stated that &quot;in this case, there was already a significant amount of blockage in the coronary arteries.&quot;

<text>Panzer General is a 1994 computer wargame developed and published by Strategic Simulations Inc. (SSI). It simulates conflict during World War II. The designers of &quot;Panzer General&quot; were heavily influenced by the Japanese wargame series &quot;Daisenryaku&quot;.

&quot;Panzer General&quot; was a major commercial hit: 250,000 units were sold at full price, and long tail sales continued in the years ahead. It became and remained SSI&#x27;s best-selling game across all genres, and was named the best-selling computer wargame of all time in 2007. It is the first in the commercially successful &quot;Panzer General&quot; series.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Panzer General&quot; is a turn-based game, set on operational level hex maps. One plays lone scenarios from either Axis or Allied side and against a computer or human opponent. In Campaign Mode, the player assumes the role of a German Generalissimus against the Allied computer.

&quot;Panzer General&quot; is an operational-level game, and units approximate battalions, although the unit size and map scale from one scenario to the next are elastic. While the names and information for the units are reasonably accurate, the scenarios only approximate historical situations.

Its novel feature was to link individual scenarios into a campaign spanning World War II from 1939 to 1945. Units are able to gain experience and become stronger, where success in one battle would award the player prestige to upgrade units, acquire additional units, and select a better scenario for the next battle.

The game requires the player to use combined-arms tactics, where each unit is strong against some unit types but very vulnerable to others. Dug-in enemy positions must be softened by artillery, which is vulnerable and needs protection. Before attacking the infantry and anti-tank, one needs first to destroy the enemy artillery that protects them from behind. If no tanks can get within range, one does this mostly by bombers, but then it is advantageous to destroy the air defense units first. The fighter planes must negotiate dual roles: destroying the enemy air force and protecting their own bombers.

The player must carefully observe the road system to speed the advance, or may use Bridge engineers to cross the rivers. The game rewards a Blitzkrieg strategy - penetrating deep into the enemy positions while postponing the destruction of some of the encountered enemy units for later.

The performance of units is increased by their experience points, which are acquired through combat. In Campaign mode particularly, one then has to protect the experienced units as the most valuable assets.

===Campaigns===
&quot;Panzer General&quot; has 38 scenarios based on real or fictitious battles from World War II. The player can engage in a single battle or a campaign mode.

In Campaign Mode, a series of battles unfold as a campaign heads to victory. There is one long campaign as Germany, with five starting locales:

* Poland (1939); from Poland, through Norway, to the West with possible amphibious invasion in Britain.
* North Africa (1941); from North Africa to the Middle East.
* Barbarossa (1941); from the initial invasion of the Soviet border to Moscow.
* Italy (1943); from the Allied landing on Sicily to the end of the war.
* Kharkov (1943); from the German spring offensive to the end of the war.

The task in most scenarios is to take all objective cities in a given number of turns; taking them at least five turns earlier is considered a &quot;major victory&quot;. In scenarios from later stages of war, the Germans try to hold positions against a stronger enemy. A typical task is then &quot;hold at least two of our objective cities for 20 turns; for a major victory, hold at least five&quot;.

All campaigns branch out and end either by the general being sacked for incompetence or end of the war. In Campaign Mode, a major victory could possibly change known historical events. For example, after a major victory over France, the player invades Britain. Later in the game, after a major victory in Barbarossa, the player can convince the German High Command to attack Moscow immediately (which costs him or her much prestige) rather than diverting to Kiev before Moscow.

If the player achieves a major victory both in Britain and in Moscow, he or she is allowed to carry out an invasion of the United States and reach Washington. In any other case, he/she must fight well in many battles to get another chance to attack them. If either Britain or USSR survive this attack, they drive the Germans all the way back to Berlin. The best the player can do is to fight well in each battle to have enough prestige for the next one - and to achieve a major victory in the final defense of Berlin.

==Development==
The design of &quot;Panzer General&quot; was based on the Japanese wargame &quot;Daisenryaku&quot;. The Strategic Simulations (SSI) team had played a Japanese-language version of the game&#x27;s Sega Genesis release extensively, and were inspired by its streamlined design. Scenario designer Chuck Kroegel later described &quot;Panzer General&quot;″s structure as &quot;diametrically opposed to the Gary Grigsby type of game that SSI was used to making&quot;. He noted that SSI founder Joel Billings was initially hesitant to adopt the design style. The company&#x27;s Graeme Bayless later wrote of &quot;Daisenryaku&quot;: &quot;The genius in this game was the fact that it took the highly complex subject (WWII conflict on land) and boiled it down to the pertinent parts&quot;.

&quot;Daisenryaku&quot; would go on to serve as the inspiration for the entire &quot;Panzer General&quot; series.

==Reception==
===Sales===
&quot;Panzer General&quot; was a commercial success. By November 1995, it had sold over 100,000 copies in the United States and 50,000 in Europe. According to William R. Trotter of &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;, it was particularly popular in Germany. By August 1996, sales had surpassed 250,000 copies. Describing the situation at the time, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; columnist Terry Coleman wrote: &quot;When you consider that a new Windows 95 and Macintosh version has just been released, it seems fair to say that &quot;PG&quot; will be incontestably the best-selling historical wargame of all time&quot;. The following year, T. Liam McDonald of GameSpot reiterated that the game had sold over 250,000 copies, and noted that 60,000 of these sales came from its PlayStation release. In 2007, &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; dubbed &quot;Panzer General&quot; &quot;greatest-selling true wargame of all time&quot;, and SSI&#x27;s most successful title across all genres. The magazine noted that it had accrued 250,000 full-price units sold &quot;and many more in the following years&quot;.

===Computer versions===
&quot;Panzer General&quot; won &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s 1994 &quot;Wargame of the Year&quot; and &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;″s &quot;Best Wargame&quot; awards, and was a runner-up for the former magazine&#x27;s overall &quot;Game of the Year&quot; award, which went to &quot;&quot;. The editors of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; called &quot;Panzer General&quot; &quot;the first wargame since 1987 to garner the #1 spot on the &quot;CGW&quot; Top 100 poll—a fine endorsement for the most exciting wargame in a long time&quot;.

In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed it as number 51 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, contending that though the game&#x27;s interface is simple, the complexity of the strategy is exceptional. In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; declared &quot;Panzer General&quot; the 15th-best computer game ever released, and listed the Game Over scene as #8 on its list of &quot;the 15 best ways to die in computer gaming&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s wargame columnist Terry Coleman named it his pick for the best computer wargame released by late 1996.

In 1996, &quot;Panzer General&quot; won the Origins Award for &quot;Best Military or Strategy Computer Game of 1995&quot;.

===Console ports===
Reviews for the 3DO version were generally positive. The four reviewers of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; remarked that the game&#x27;s high level of complexity makes it difficult to get into and unappealing to anyone but enthusiasts of the genre, but that the gameplay design is solid and there is a strong dose of variety to the campaigns. A critic for &quot;Next Generation&quot; argued that while the music and battle animations quickly wear thin, the game allows them to be turned off and &quot;what it lacks in style, it makes up in substance&quot;. He made particular note of the impressive depth of the strategy and the ability to control nearly every land and aircraft used in the World War II European theater. Sir Garnabus of &quot;GamePro&quot; complimented the accuracy of the 3DO port but otherwise panned the game, contending that war strategy games in general are poor due to their minimalist graphics and focus on thinking rather than acting.

In their brief review of the PlayStation version, &quot;Next Generation&quot; remarked: &quot;One of the best PC wargames of all time and still highly thought of, this version doesn&#x27;t miss a trick&quot;.

==Legacy==

In 1996, Robert Mayer of &quot;Computer Games Strategy Plus&quot; argued:

Bruce Geryk of GameSpot argued that &quot;Panzer General&quot; resurrected the computer wargaming genre.

===Direct sequels===
&quot;Panzer General&quot; was the first game in the &quot;Panzer General&quot; series, which grew in the years after its release. It was followed by &quot;Allied General&quot; (&quot;Panzer General II&quot; in Germany), which allows play from the Allied point of view and features four new campaigns. Other sequels include &quot;Fantasy General&quot;, &quot;Pacific General&quot; and &quot;Star General&quot;. Its mainline sequel, &quot;Panzer General II&quot; (titled &quot;Panzer General 3D&quot; in Germany), upgraded the interface to use an overlay of photorealistic terrain, and to display different unit facings, resulting in an improved appearance. In the April 2000 issue of &quot;PC Gamer&quot;, it was voted the 44th best computer game of all time.

The series continued with &quot;People&#x27;s General&quot;, an upgraded version of &quot;Panzer General II&quot; based on a World War III scenario between China and the UN. &quot;Panzer General&quot; also provided a Play by Email (PBEM) system. &quot;Panzer General 3D Assault&quot; arrived in 1999, with fully 3D graphics. &quot;Panzer General III: Scorched Earth&quot; was released in 2000, with better graphics and a redesigned interface.

<doc id="357874" wikidata="Q164523" url="?curid=357874" title="Northrop T-38 Talon">
<text>The Northrop T-38 Talon is a two-seat, twinjet supersonic jet trainer designed and produced by the American aircraft manufacturer Northrop Corporation. It was the world&#x27;s first supersonic trainer as well as the most produced.

The T-38 can be traced back to 1952 and Northrop&#x27;s N-102 Fang and &quot;N-156&quot; fighter aircraft projects. During the mid-1950s, Northrop officials decided to adapt the N-156 to suit a recently issued general operating requirement by the United States Air Force (USAF) for a supersonic trainer to replace the Lockheed T-33. The bid was successful, in no small part on its lower lifecycle cost comparisons to competing aircraft, and the company received an initial order to build three prototypes. The first of these, designated &quot;YT-38&quot;, made its maiden flight on 10 April 1959. The T-38 was introduced to USAF service on 17 March 1961.
The USAF is the largest operator of the T-38. Additional operators of the T-38 include NASA and the United States Navy. U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in Patuxent River, Maryland, is the principal US Navy operator. Other T-38s were previously used by the US Navy for dissimilar air combat training until replaced by the similar Northrop F-5 Tiger II. Pilots of other NATO nations have commonly flown the T-38 during joint training programs with American pilots. The T-38 remains in service with several air forces. , the T-38 has been in service for over 60 years with the USAF, its original operator.

In September 2018, USAF announced the possible replacement of the Talon by the Boeing–Saab T-7 Red Hawk, by 2034, if a planned initial low rate production, of the T-7A occurred by 2026, dependent on congressional approval, and aircraft are received, evaluated, and receive Initial Operating Capability, by the USAF, in 2027.

==Development==





In 1952, Northrop began work on a fighter project, the &quot;N-102 Fang&quot;, with shoulder-mounted delta wing and a single engine. The proposed General Electric J79 engine, weighing nearly two tons, meant the resulting aircraft would be large and expensive. During 1953, representatives from General Electric Aviation&#x27;s newly created Small Aircraft Engine Department showed Northrop a relatively compact engine, around 400 lb installed weight, capable of 2,500 lb of thrust. Upon seeing the engine, Northrop VP-Engineering Edgar Schmued saw the possibility of reversing the trend toward the large fighters.

Schmued and chief engineer Welko Gasich decided on a small, twin-engined &quot;hot-rod&quot; fighter, the &quot;N-156&quot;. Northrop launched its N-156 project in 1954, aiming for a small, supersonic fighter jet capable of operating from the US Navy&#x27;s escort carriers. When the Navy chose not to pursue equipping its fleets in such a fashion, favoring large fleet carriers instead, Northrop opted to continue work on the N-156 using in-house funding. It was instead recast as a lightweight fighter, referred to as the &quot;N-156F&quot;, that was primarily aimed at the export market.

In the mid-1950s, the USAF issued a general operating requirement for a supersonic trainer, seeking to retire its 1940s-era Lockheed T-33s for an aircraft better suited to training pilots to fly its high speed fighter aircraft. Northrop officials decided to adapt the N-156 to this competition. The only other candidate was the two-seat version of the North American F-100 Super Sabre. Although the F-100 was not considered the ideal candidate for a training aircraft (it is not capable of recovering from a spin), NAA was still considered the favorite in the competition due to that company&#x27;s favored-contractor status with the USAF, but Northrop officials presented lifecycle cost comparisons that proved to be highly persuasive amongst USAF officials. Accordingly, Northrop was awarded an initial contract in June 1956 to produce three prototypes, designated &quot;YT-38&quot;.

On 10 April 1959, the first YT-38 performed its maiden flight at the hands of test pilot Lew Nelson.

The type was quickly adopted. The first production examples were delivered in 1961, entering service on 17 March 1961, complementing the Cessna T-37 Tweet primary jet trainer. When production ended in 1972, 1,187 T-38s had been built, plus two N-156T prototypes. Since its introduction, an estimated 50,000 military pilots have trained on this aircraft. The USAF remains one of the few armed flying forces using dedicated supersonic final trainers, as most, such as the US Navy, use high-subsonic trainers.

During 1962, the T-38 set absolute time-to-climb records for 3,000, 6,000, 9,000, and 12,000 meters, beating the records for those altitudes set by the F-104 in December 1958. The F-4 Phantom beat the T-38&#x27;s records less than a month later.

The majority of T-38s built were of the &quot;T-38A&quot; variant. The USAF had a small number of aircraft converted for weapons training, designated &quot;AT-38B&quot;, which were fitted with a gunsight and could carry a gun pod, rockets, or bombs on a centerline pylon. By the end of September 2017, 503 T-38s were still operational with the USAF, while many more remained in operation around the world.

Most of the USAF&#x27;s aircraft, T-38A and AT-38B, have been converted to the T-38C through an avionics upgrade program. Improvements include the addition of a head-up display, global satellite positioning, inertial navigation system, and traffic collision avoidance system. Most aircraft have received a propulsion modification to improve low-altitude engine thrust. Around a third of the fleet, those that experience more severe usage, are currently undergoing structural replacements and upgrades, as well as receiving new wings, to extend their service life to 2029.

The fighter version of the N-156 was selected for the US Military Assistance Program and produced as the F-5 Freedom Fighter. Many of these have since reverted to a weapons-training role, as various air forces have introduced newer types into service. The F-5G was an advanced single-engined variant later renamed the F-20 Tigershark. In 2018, the Iranian Air Force announced that an outwardly similar aircraft, named the Kowsar, had been constructed within Iran.

==Design==
The Northrop T-38 Talon is of a conventional configuration, with a small, low-mounted, long-chord wing, a single vertical stabilizer, and tricycle undercarriage. The cockpit accommodates a student pilot and instructor in a tandem seating arrangement. The flight controls were hydraulically-powered and lacked manual reversion, and thus the aircraft would be unflyable in the event of both engines failing mid-flight.

Its handling was relatively conventional and viceless. While it was originally considered to be too easy to fly compared with frontline fighters of the 1960s, by the twenty-first century, it had become regarded as the most challenging aircraft in the USAF&#x27;s inventory. The aircraft&#x27;s nimble performance earned it the nickname &quot;white rocket&quot;. It had been considered by trainee pilots to be a somewhat unforgiving aircraft from an aerodynamic standpoint.

The T-38 can be visually distinguished from both the F-5B and F-5F, which are also derived from the N-156, by the wings. The wing of the T-38 meets the fuselage straight and ends square, while the F-5 has leading edge extensions near the wing roots and wingtip launch rails for air-to-air missiles. The wings of both the T-38 and the F-5 family use conventional skin over spar-rib structure. The T-38&#x27;s wings were originally designed to withstand 7.33-G loads and for a fatigue life of 4,000 flight hours. This proved sufficient for the majority of the training syllabus, but was a major limiting factor when the aircraft was used for aggressive dogfighting-style maneuvering. Incidents of wing tips separating mid-flight were reported. Northrop resolved this via the installation of new wings with thickened skins.

Throughout the development process, a strict weight control regime was exercised by the design team. This was one reason for the T-38&#x27;s relative simplicity; only basic systems for navigation and communication were provided. No fuel was housed within the wings while no provision for external stores was made. The aircraft&#x27;s twin General Electric J85-5A turbojet engines were accommodated within the fuselage to exert less drag and produce fewer aerodynamic disturbances. The J85-5A engine, despite generating up to 3,850 lb of static thrust, was relatively compact and lightweight for the era, weighing less than 600 pounds. Air was supplied to the engines via intakes at the wing roots. A twin-engine arrangement had been pursued to provide a greater margin of safety.

Various design decisions were taken and features were incorporated to simplify the T-38 and make it as easy to maintain as possible. To avoid removing the vertical fin while changing an engine, the fin was attached directly to the keel structure between the engines, and instead detaching the horizontal stabilizer along with the entire aft shell of the fuselage that surrounds the engines, which could be removed relatively easily via undoing several fasteners that hold the fuselage shell together and disconnecting two push rods that connect the pilot&#x27;s control stick to the horizontal stabilizer&#x27;s hydraulic actuators.

To avoid having to break and reconnect multiple hydraulic lines during an engine swap, designers mounted the hydraulic pump and other accessory drives on the fuselage which joined to the engine by a short driveshaft. Several internal check valves prevented a loss of hydraulic fluid. The engines hung from rails on either side of the central keel. This design enabled ground crews to remove and replace an engine in roughly one hour.

==Operational history==

===Military===
The USAF Strategic Air Command (SAC) had T-38s in service from 1978 until SAC&#x27;s 1991 inactivation. These aircraft were used to enhance the career development of bomber and tanker copilots through the Accelerated Copilot Enrichment Program. They were later used as proficiency aircraft for all B-52, B-1, Lockheed SR-71, U-2, Boeing KC-135, and KC-10 pilots. SAC&#x27;s successors, the Air Combat Command (ACC) and the Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) retain T-38s as proficiency aircraft for U-2 pilots and B-2 pilots, respectively.

The Air Training Command&#x27;s successor, the Air Education and Training Command (AETC), uses the T-38C to prepare pilots for the F-15C Eagle and F-15E Strike Eagle, the F-16 Fighting Falcon, B-52 Stratofortress, B-1B Lancer, B-2 Spirit, A-10 Thunderbolt, F-22 Raptor, and F-35 Lightning II. The AETC received T-38Cs in 2001 as part of the Avionics Upgrade Program. The T-38Cs owned by the AETC have undergone propulsion modernization, which replaces major engine components to enhance reliability and maintainability, and an engine inlet/injector modification to increase available takeoff thrust. These upgrades and modifications, with the Pacer Classic program, were to extend the service life of T-38s past 2020. The T-38 has an availability goal of 75%, which it maintained in 2011. In 2015, its availability was 60%.

After graduating from basic flying on the Cessna T-37 Tweet, pilots were trained on more advanced aspects, including supersonic flight, blind flying, formation flight, handling stalls, single-engine flight procedures, low speed flight, and landing techniques. Prior to the USAF ceasing the practice of trainees flying within icy conditions, the T-38&#x27;s engines were prone to being damaged by ingesting ice. The relatively small engine intakes are also known to be problematic when flown at low speeds under &#x27;hot and high&#x27; conditions.

The landing gear&#x27;s brakes have been criticised for being relatively weak, one of several factors that necessitates care while landing. Several incidents, including fatalities, have occurred due to imprecise management of the throttles and air speed during landing attempts. Despite these factors, the T-38 has been regarded as a relatively safe trainer aircraft even into the twenty-first century. Between 1961 and 2005, the fleet has cumulatively flown 25 million hours, during which 150 of the 1,187 T-38s built between 1961 and 1972 were recorded as lost, resulting in 45 deaths.

Besides the USAF and the USN, other military operators of the T-38 have included the German Air Force, the Portuguese Air Force, the Republic of China Air Force, and the Turkish Air Force.

During late 2010, the USAF launched the T-X program to procure a replacement for its T-38s. Bidders included a joint venture of BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce, offering the Hawk trainer, equipped with Rolls&#x27; Adour Mk951 engine with FADEC. Lockheed Martin and Korea Aerospace Industries, offered the T-50. Raytheon and Alenia Aermacchi offered the T-100, an aircraft whose design originated with the M-346.

Boeing and Saab offered a new-technology design powered by the General Electric F404 turbofan engine. The Boeing/Saab bid first flew in December 2016. It was declared the winner of the T-X competition in September 2018.

===NASA===
NASA operates a fleet of 32 T-38 trainers. The fleet is typically used to train its astronauts and as a chase plane. NASA&#x27;s fleet is housed primarily at Ellington Field in Houston, Texas. NASA&#x27;s internal projections showed the number of operational jet trainers falling to 16 by 2015. The agency spends $25–30 million annually to fly and maintain the T-38s.

In 1966, two Project Gemini astronauts, Elliot See and Charles Bassett, died when their T-38 hit the roof of a McDonnell Douglas fabrication building at Lambert Field in St. Louis. Visibility was poor, but a later investigation concluded that the cause of the crash was likely pilot error.
During the Space Shuttle era, an established NASA tradition was for astronauts to arrive at the Kennedy Space Center in T-38 Talons.

===Civil===
Seven privately owned T-38s are in the U.S. Boeing owns two T-38s, which are used as chase planes. Thornton Corporation owns two T-38s, and the National Test Pilot School owns one T-38. Two others are in private ownership.

<doc id="357875" wikidata="Q2255256" url="?curid=357875" title="Short octave">
<text>The short octave was a method of assigning notes to keys in early keyboard instruments (harpsichord, clavichord, organ), for the purpose of giving the instrument an extended range in the bass register. A closely related system, the [[#Broken octave|broken octave]], added more notes by using split keys: the front part and the back part of the (visible) key controlled separate levers and hence separate notes.

==Short octave==
===First type===
One variant of the short octave system was employed in the instrument shown above. Here, the lowest note on the keyboard was nominally E, but the pitch to which it was tuned was actually C. Nominal F was tuned to D, and nominal G was tuned to E. Thus, starting at the lowest note on the keyboard and playing these keys:

:E F G F G A B C

the player would hear the musical scale of C major in the bass:

:C D E F G A B C

The actual note assignments can be seen in the following diagram, which shows the lowest eight keys of an early keyboard:

The rationale behind this system was that the low notes F and G are seldom needed in early music. Deep bass notes typically form the root of the chord, and F and G chords were seldom used at this time. In contrast, low C and D, both roots of very common chords, are sorely missed if a harpsichord with lowest key E is tuned to match the keyboard layout. When scholars specify the pitch range of instruments with this kind of short octave, they write &quot;C/E&quot;, meaning that the lowest note is a C, played on a key that normally would sound E.

===Second type===
A second type of short octave used the keys
:B C D C D E F G
to play the G major scale
:G A B C D E F G.
Here, the exotic bass notes C and D are sacrificed to obtain the more essential G and A. The notation for the pitch range of such an instrument is &quot;G/B&quot;. The following diagram illustrates this kind of short octave:

In stringed instruments like the harpsichord, the short octave system created a defect: the strings which were tuned to mismatch their keyboard notes were in general too short to sound the reassigned note with good tone quality. To reach the lower pitch, the strings had to be thickened, or tuned too slack. During the 17th and 18th centuries, harpsichord builders gradually increased the size and bass range of their instruments to the point where every bass note could be properly played with its own key.

Short octaves were very common in the early organ. Here, the practice would not have yielded poor tone quality (since the associated pipes would have to be built with the correct length in any event). Far more than on stringed instruments the financial savings would have been quite considerable, as the long pipes entailed quite an expense, even in materials alone. But as harmonic music developed more complexity in the late 17th and 18th centuries and the desire arose for completely chromatic bass octaves, short octaves ultimately came to be abandoned in organs as well.

===History===

The 18th-century author Quirinus van Blankenburg suggested that the C/E short octave originated as an extension of keyboards that went down only to F; the addition of just one key (nominal E) and the reassignment of the F and G added three new notes to the bass range. Van Blankenburg says that when the short octave was invented, it was called the &quot;new extension&quot; for this reason. According to Frank Hubbard, harpsichords and organs of the 16th and 17th centuries &quot;almost always&quot; had short octaves.

Edward Kottick notes that the short octave persisted for a long time, suggests that a kind of mutual inertia between composers and instrument builders may have been responsible:

Our forebears were much more practical than we are. Since nobody wrote music that required those notes, why go to the expense of putting them in? And what composer would bother to write them if few keyboard instruments had them?
A transitional stage toward the final adoption of chromatic keyboards was seen in certain English virginals of the later 17th century. On these the lowest key could pluck two different strings, depending on the slot in which its jack was placed. One of these strings was tuned to low G (the normal pitch of this key in the G/B short octave) and the other to whatever missing chromatic pitch was desired. The player could then move the jack to the slot that provided the desired note, according to the piece being played.

==Broken octave==
A variant of the short octave added more notes by using split keys: the front part and the back part of the (visible) key controlled separate levers and hence separate notes. Assume the following keys:

:E F F G G A

with both F and G split front to back. Here, E played C, the front half of the F key played D, and the (less accessible) rear half played F. The front half of the G key played E, and the rear half played G. As with the short octave, the key labeled E played the lowest note C. Thus, playing the nominal sequence

:E F(front) G(front) F F(back) G G(back) A

the player would hear:

:C D E F F G G A

The actual note assignments can be seen in the following diagram:

It can be seen that only two notes of the chromatic scale, C and D, are missing. An analogous arrangement existed for keyboards with G instead of C at the bottom.

According to Trevor Pinnock, the short octave is characteristic of instruments of the 16th century. He adds, &quot;in the second half of the 17th century, when more accidentals were required in the bass, &#x27;broken octave&#x27; was often used.&quot;

===Viennese bass octave===

The short/broken octave principle not only survived, but was even developed further in one particular location, Vienna. The &quot;Viennese bass octave&quot; (German: &quot;&quot;) lasted well into the second half of the 18th century. describes this keyboard arrangement as follows:

The notes leading down to F1 were accommodated on the keys of a &quot;short-scaled octave&quot; from &quot;c&quot; to &quot;C&quot; (only &quot;F&quot;1 and &quot;G&quot;1, as well as &quot;C&quot; and &quot;E&quot; continued to be omitted.

The assignment of notes to keys, which strikingly included a triple-split key, was as shown in the following diagram, adapted from :

Richard Maunder (who uses the term &quot;multiple-broken short octave&quot;) observes that the Viennese bass octave, like its predecessors, imposed distortions on the string scaling of the harpsichord: it &quot;leads to extreme foreshortening of the scale in the bass.&quot; Hence, it required unusually thick strings for the bottom notes, on the order of .

The Viennese bass octave gradually went out of style. However, Maunder notes instruments with Viennese bass octave built even in 1795, and observe that advertisements for such instruments appear even up to the end of the century.

==Music written specifically for short-octave instruments==

 \new Voice { \voiceTwo \relative c&#x27; { \clef &quot;treble&quot; \time 2/2 \key c \major | r2 \stemDown c8 [ \stemDown a8 ] \stemDown e&#x27;4 s1 \bar &quot;|.&quot; }}
 \new Staff «
 \new Voice { \voiceOne \relative a { \clef &quot;bass&quot; \time 2/2 \key c \major | r4 r8 \stemUp a8 r4 r8 \stemUp a8 | &lt;e, b&#x27; e gis&gt;1 \bar &quot;|.&quot; }}
 \new Voice { \voiceTwo \relative a, { \clef &quot;bass&quot; \time 2/2 \key c \major | \stemDown &lt;a e&#x27;&gt;2 ~ ~ \stemDown &lt;a e&#x27;&gt;2 s1 \bar &quot;|.&quot; }}
»
&lt;/score&gt;}}
While the short octave seems primarily to have been an economy measure, it does have the advantage that the player&#x27;s left hand can in certain cases span a greater number of notes. The composer Peter Philips wrote a pavane in which the left hand plays many parallel tenths. This is a considerable stretch for many players, and become even harder when (as in Philips&#x27;s pavane), there sometimes other notes included in the chord. Of this piece harpsichord scholar Edward Kottick writes, &quot;The sensuality of effortlessly achieving tenths is so strong, so delightful, that one cannot really claim to know the piece unless it has been played on a short-octave keyboard.&quot;

A later composer who wrote music conveniently playable only on a broken-octave instrument was Joseph Haydn, whose early work for keyboard was intended for harpsichord, not piano. As points out, Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Capriccio in G on the folk song &#x27;, H. XVII:1 (1765) is evidently written for a harpsichord employing the Viennese bass octave. The work terminates in a chord in which the player&#x27;s left hand must cover a low G, the G an octave above it, and the B two notes higher still. On orthodox keyboards this would be an impossible stretch for most players, but as on the Viennese bass octave it would have been easy to play, with the fingers depressing keys that visually appeared as D–G–B (see diagram above).

When Haydn&#x27;s Capriccio was published by Artaria in the 1780s, the Viennese bass octave had mostly disappeared (indeed, the harpsichord itself was becoming obsolete). The publisher accordingly included alternative notes in the places where the original version could be played only on a short octave instrument, presumably to accommodate the needs of purchasers who owned a harpsichord or piano with the ordinary chromatic bass octave.

<text>Test-driven development (TDD) is a way of writing code that involves writing an automated unit-level test case that fails, then writing just enough code to make the test pass, then refactoring both the test code and the production code, then repeating with another new test case.

Alternative approaches to writing automated tests is to write all of the production code before starting on the test code or to write all of the test code before starting on the production code. With TDD, both are written together, therefore shortening debugging time necessities.

TDD is related to the test-first programming concepts of extreme programming, begun in 1999, but more recently has created more general interest in its own right.

Programmers also apply the concept to improving and debugging legacy code developed with older techniques. 

== History ==
Software engineer Kent Beck, who is credited with having developed or &quot;rediscovered&quot; the technique, stated in 2003 that TDD encourages simple designs and inspires confidence.

== Coding cycle ==
The TDD steps vary somewhat by author in count and description, but are generally as follows. These are based on the book &quot;Test-Driven Development by Example&quot;, and Kent Beck&#x27;s Canon TDD article.

;1. List scenarios for the new feature
:List the expected variants in the new behavior. “There’s the basic case &amp; then what-if this service times out &amp; what-if the key isn’t in the database yet &amp;…” The developer can discover these specifications by asking about use cases and user stories. A key benefit of TDD is that it makes the developer focus on requirements &quot;before&quot; writing code. This is in contrast with the usual practice, where unit tests are only written &quot;after&quot; code.
;2. Write a test for an item on the list
:Write an automated test that &quot;would&quot; pass if the variant in the new behavior is met. 
;3. Run all tests. The new test should &quot;fail&quot; for &quot;expected&quot; reasons
:This shows that new code is actually needed for the desired feature. It validates that the test harness is working correctly. It rules out the possibility that the new test is flawed and will always pass. 
;4. Write the simplest code that passes the new test
:Inelegant code and hard coding is acceptable. The code will be honed in Step 6. No code should be added beyond the tested functionality.
;5. All tests should now pass
:If any fail, fix failing tests with minimal changes until all pass.
;6. Refactor as needed while ensuring all tests continue to pass 
:Code is refactored for readability and maintainability. In particular, hard-coded test data should be removed from the production code. Running the test suite after each refactor ensures that no existing functionality is broken. Examples of refactoring:
:* moving code to where it most logically belongs
:* removing duplicate code
:* making names self-documenting 
:* splitting methods into smaller pieces
:* re-arranging inheritance hierarchies
;Repeat
:Repeat the process, starting at step 2, with each test on the list until all tests are implemented and passing.

Each tests should be small and commits made often. If new code fails some tests, the programmer can undo or revert rather than debug excessively. 

When using external libraries, it is important not to write tests that are so small as to effectively test merely the library itself, unless there is some reason to believe that the library is buggy or not feature-rich enough to serve all the needs of the software under development.

== Test-driven work ==

TDD has been adopted outside of software development, in both product and service teams, as test-driven work. For testing to be successful, it needs to be practiced at the micro and macro levels. Every method in a class, every input data value, log message, and error code, amongst other data points, need to be tested. Similar to TDD, non-software teams develop quality control (QC) checks (usually manual tests rather than automated tests) for each aspect of the work prior to commencing. These QC checks are then used to inform the design and validate the associated outcomes. The six steps of the TDD sequence are applied with minor semantic changes:
# &quot;Add a check&quot; replaces &quot;Add a test&quot;
# &quot;Run all checks&quot; replaces &quot;Run all tests&quot;
# &quot;Do the work&quot; replaces &quot;Write some code&quot;
# &quot;Run all checks&quot; replaces &quot;Run tests&quot;
# &quot;Clean up the work&quot; replaces &quot;Refactor code&quot;
# &quot;Repeat&quot;

== Development style ==
There are various aspects to using test-driven development, for example the principles of &quot;keep it simple, stupid&quot; (KISS) and &quot;You aren&#x27;t gonna need it&quot; (YAGNI). By focusing on writing only the code necessary to pass tests, designs can often be cleaner and clearer than is achieved by other methods. In &quot;Test-Driven Development by Example&quot;, Kent Beck also suggests the principle &quot;Fake it till you make it&quot;.

To achieve some advanced design concept such as a design pattern, tests are written that generate that design. The code may remain simpler than the target pattern, but still pass all required tests. This can be unsettling at first but it allows the developer to focus only on what is important.

Writing the tests first: The tests should be written before the functionality that is to be tested. This has been claimed to have many benefits. It helps ensure that the application is written for testability, as the developers must consider how to test the application from the outset rather than adding it later. It also ensures that tests for every feature gets written. Additionally, writing the tests first leads to a deeper and earlier understanding of the product requirements, ensures the effectiveness of the test code, and maintains a continual focus on software quality. When writing feature-first code, there is a tendency by developers and organizations to push the developer on to the next feature, even neglecting testing entirely. The first TDD test might not even compile at first, because the classes and methods it requires may not yet exist. Nevertheless, that first test functions as the beginning of an executable specification.

Each test case fails initially: This ensures that the test really works and can catch an error. Once this is shown, the underlying functionality can be implemented. This has led to the &quot;test-driven development mantra&quot;, which is &quot;red/green/refactor&quot;, where red means &quot;fail&quot; and green means &quot;pass&quot;. Test-driven development constantly repeats the steps of adding test cases that fail, passing them, and refactoring. Receiving the expected test results at each stage reinforces the developer&#x27;s mental model of the code, boosts confidence and increases productivity.

===Code visibility===
Test code needs access to the code it is testing, but testing should not compromise normal design goals such as information hiding, encapsulation and the separation of concerns. Therefore, unit test code is usually located in the same project or module as the code being tested.

In object oriented design this still does not provide access to private data and methods. Therefore, extra work may be necessary for unit tests. In Java and other languages, a developer can use reflection to access private fields and methods. Alternatively, an inner class can be used to hold the unit tests so they have visibility of the enclosing class&#x27;s members and attributes. In the .NET Framework and some other programming languages, partial classes may be used to expose private methods and data for the tests to access.

It is important that such testing hacks do not remain in the production code. In C and other languages, compiler directives such as codice_1 can be placed around such additional classes and indeed all other test-related code to prevent them being compiled into the released code. This means the released code is not exactly the same as what was unit tested. The regular running of fewer but more comprehensive, end-to-end, integration tests on the final release build can ensure (among other things) that no production code exists that subtly relies on aspects of the test harness.

There is some debate among practitioners of TDD, documented in their blogs and other writings, as to whether it is wise to test private methods and data anyway. Some argue that private members are a mere implementation detail that may change, and should be allowed to do so without breaking numbers of tests. Thus it should be sufficient to test any class through its public interface or through its subclass interface, which some languages call the &quot;protected&quot; interface. Others say that crucial aspects of functionality may be implemented in private methods and testing them directly offers advantage of smaller and more direct unit tests.

===Fakes, mocks and integration tests===
Unit tests are so named because they each test &quot;one unit&quot; of code. A complex module may have a thousand unit tests and a simple module may have only ten. The unit tests used for TDD should never cross process boundaries in a program, let alone network connections. Doing so introduces delays that make tests run slowly and discourage developers from running the whole suite. Introducing dependencies on external modules or data also turns &quot;unit tests&quot; into &quot;integration tests&quot;. If one module misbehaves in a chain of interrelated modules, it is not so immediately clear where to look for the cause of the failure.

When code under development relies on a database, a web service, or any other external process or service, enforcing a unit-testable separation is also an opportunity and a driving force to design more modular, more testable and more reusable code. Two steps are necessary:

# Whenever external access is needed in the final design, an interface should be defined that describes the access available. See the dependency inversion principle for a discussion of the benefits of doing this regardless of TDD.
# The interface should be implemented in two ways, one of which really accesses the external process, and the other of which is a fake or mock. Fake objects need do little more than add a message such as &quot;Person object saved&quot; to a trace log, against which a test assertion can be run to verify correct behaviour. Mock objects differ in that they themselves contain test assertions that can make the test fail, for example, if the person&#x27;s name and other data are not as expected.

Fake and mock object methods that return data, ostensibly from a data store or user, can help the test process by always returning the same, realistic data that tests can rely upon. They can also be set into predefined fault modes so that error-handling routines can be developed and reliably tested. In a fault mode, a method may return an invalid, incomplete or null response, or may throw an exception. Fake services other than data stores may also be useful in TDD: A fake encryption service may not, in fact, encrypt the data passed; a fake random number service may always return 1. Fake or mock implementations are examples of dependency injection.

A test double is a test-specific capability that substitutes for a system capability, typically a class or function, that the UUT depends on. There are two times at which test doubles can be introduced into a system: link and execution. Link time substitution is when the test double is compiled into the load module, which is executed to validate testing. This approach is typically used when running in an environment other than the target environment that requires doubles for the hardware level code for compilation. The alternative to linker substitution is run-time substitution in which the real functionality is replaced during the execution of a test case. This substitution is typically done through the reassignment of known function pointers or object replacement.

Test doubles are of a number of different types and varying complexities:
* Dummy – A dummy is the simplest form of a test double. It facilitates linker time substitution by providing a default return value where required. 
* Stub – A stub adds simplistic logic to a dummy, providing different outputs. 
* Spy – A spy captures and makes available parameter and state information, publishing accessors to test code for private information allowing for more advanced state validation. 
* Mock – A mock is specified by an individual test case to validate test-specific behavior, checking parameter values and call sequencing. 
* Simulator – A simulator is a comprehensive component providing a higher-fidelity approximation of the target capability (the thing being doubled). A simulator typically requires significant additional development effort.

A corollary of such dependency injection is that the actual database or other external-access code is never tested by the TDD process itself. To avoid errors that may arise from this, other tests are needed that instantiate the test-driven code with the &quot;real&quot; implementations of the interfaces discussed above. These are integration tests and are quite separate from the TDD unit tests. There are fewer of them, and they must be run less often than the unit tests. They can nonetheless be implemented using the same testing framework.

Integration tests that alter any persistent store or database should always be designed carefully with consideration of the initial and final state of the files or database, even if any test fails. This is often achieved using some combination of the following techniques:
* The codice_2 method, which is integral to many test frameworks.
* codice_3 exception handling structures where available.
* Database transactions where a transaction atomically includes perhaps a write, a read and a matching delete operation.
* Taking a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the database before running any tests and rolling back to the snapshot after each test run. This may be automated using a framework such as Ant or NAnt or a continuous integration system such as CruiseControl.
* Initialising the database to a clean state &quot;before&quot; tests, rather than cleaning up &quot;after&quot; them. This may be relevant where cleaning up may make it difficult to diagnose test failures by deleting the final state of the database before detailed diagnosis can be performed.

===Keep the unit small===
For TDD, a unit is most commonly defined as a class, or a group of related functions often called a module. Keeping units relatively small is claimed to provide critical benefits, including:
* Reduced debugging effort – When test failures are detected, having smaller units aids in tracking down errors. 
* Self-documenting tests – Small test cases are easier to read and to understand.

Advanced practices of test-driven development can lead to acceptance test–driven development (ATDD) and specification by example where the criteria specified by the customer are automated into acceptance tests, which then drive the traditional unit test-driven development (UTDD) process. This process ensures the customer has an automated mechanism to decide whether the software meets their requirements. With ATDD, the development team now has a specific target to satisfy – the acceptance tests – which keeps them continuously focused on what the customer really wants from each user story.

== Best practices ==

=== Test structure ===
Effective layout of a test case ensures all required actions are completed, improves the readability of the test case, and smooths the flow of execution. Consistent structure helps in building a self-documenting test case. A commonly applied structure for test cases has (1) setup, (2) execution, (3) validation, and (4) cleanup.
* Setup: Put the Unit Under Test (UUT) or the overall test system in the state needed to run the test.
* Execution: Trigger/drive the UUT to perform the target behavior and capture all output, such as return values and output parameters. This step is usually very simple.
* Validation: Ensure the results of the test are correct. These results may include explicit outputs captured during execution or state changes in the UUT.
* Cleanup: Restore the UUT or the overall test system to the pre-test state. This restoration permits another test to execute immediately after this one. In some cases, in order to preserve the information for possible test failure analysis, the cleanup should be starting the test just before the test&#x27;s setup run. 

=== Individual best practices ===

Some best practices that an individual could follow would be to separate common set-up and tear-down logic into test support services utilized by the appropriate test cases, to keep each test oracle focused on only the results necessary to validate its test, and to design time-related tests to allow tolerance for execution in non-real time operating systems. The common practice of allowing a 5-10 percent margin for late execution reduces the potential number of false negatives in test execution. It is also suggested to treat test code with the same respect as production code. Test code must work correctly for both positive and negative cases, last a long time, and be readable and maintainable. Teams can get together and review tests and test practices to share effective techniques and catch bad habits.

=== Practices to avoid, or &quot;anti-patterns&quot; ===

* Having test cases depend on system state manipulated from previously executed test cases (i.e., you should always start a unit test from a known and pre-configured state).
* Dependencies between test cases. A test suite where test cases are dependent upon each other is brittle and complex. Execution order should not be presumed. Basic refactoring of the initial test cases or structure of the UUT causes a spiral of increasingly pervasive impacts in associated tests.
* Interdependent tests. Interdependent tests can cause cascading false negatives. A failure in an early test case breaks a later test case even if no actual fault exists in the UUT, increasing defect analysis and debug efforts.
* Testing precise execution, behavior, timing or performance.
* Building &quot;all-knowing oracles&quot;. An oracle that inspects more than necessary is more expensive and brittle over time. This very common error is dangerous because it causes a subtle but pervasive time sink across the complex project.
* Testing implementation details.
* Slow running tests.

== Comparison and demarcation ==
=== TDD and ATDD ===
Test-driven development is related to, but different from acceptance test–driven development (ATDD). TDD is primarily a developer&#x27;s tool to help create well-written unit of code (function, class, or module) that correctly performs a set of operations. ATDD is a communication tool between the customer, developer, and tester to ensure that the requirements are well-defined. TDD requires test automation. ATDD does not, although automation helps with regression testing. Tests used in TDD can often be derived from ATDD tests, since the code units implement some portion of a requirement. ATDD tests should be readable by the customer. TDD tests do not need to be.

=== TDD and BDD ===
BDD (behavior-driven development) combines practices from TDD and from ATDD.
It includes the practice of writing tests first, but focuses on tests which describe behavior, rather than tests which test a unit of implementation. Tools such as JBehave, Cucumber, Mspec and Specflow provide syntaxes which allow product owners, developers and test engineers to define together the behaviors which can then be translated into automated tests.

== Software for TDD ==
There are many testing frameworks and tools that are useful in TDD.

=== xUnit frameworks ===
Developers may use computer-assisted testing frameworks, commonly collectively named xUnit (which are derived from SUnit, created in 1998), to create and automatically run the test cases. xUnit frameworks provide assertion-style test validation capabilities and result reporting. These capabilities are critical for automation as they move the burden of execution validation from an independent post-processing activity to one that is included in the test execution. The execution framework provided by these test frameworks allows for the automatic execution of all system test cases or various subsets along with other features.

=== TAP results ===
Testing frameworks may accept unit test output in the language-agnostic Test Anything Protocol created in 1987.

== TDD for complex systems ==
Exercising TDD on large, challenging systems requires a modular architecture, well-defined components with published interfaces, and disciplined system layering with maximization of platform independence. These proven practices yield increased testability and facilitate the application of build and test automation.

=== Designing for testability ===
Complex systems require an architecture that meets a range of requirements. A key subset of these requirements includes support for the complete and effective testing of the system. Effective modular design yields components that share traits essential for effective TDD.

* High Cohesion ensures each unit provides a set of related capabilities and makes the tests of those capabilities easier to maintain.
* Low Coupling allows each unit to be effectively tested in isolation.
* Published Interfaces restrict Component access and serve as contact points for tests, facilitating test creation and ensuring the highest fidelity between test and production unit configuration.

A key technique for building effective modular architecture is Scenario Modeling where a set of sequence charts is constructed, each one focusing on a single system-level execution scenario. The Scenario Model provides an excellent vehicle for creating the strategy of interactions between components in response to a specific stimulus. Each of these Scenario Models serves as a rich set of requirements for the services or functions that a component must provide, and it also dictates the order in which these components and services interact together. Scenario modeling can greatly facilitate the construction of TDD tests for a complex system.

=== Managing tests for large teams ===
In a larger system, the impact of poor component quality is magnified by the complexity of interactions. This magnification makes the benefits of TDD accrue even faster in the context of larger projects. However, the complexity of the total population of tests can become a problem in itself, eroding potential gains. It sounds simple, but a key initial step is to recognize that test code is also important software and should be produced and maintained with the same rigor as the production code.

Creating and managing the architecture of test software within a complex system is just as important as the core product architecture. Test drivers interact with the UUT, test doubles and the unit test framework.

== Advantages and Disadvantages of Test Driven Development ==

=== Advantages ===

Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code. It offers several advantages:

# Comprehensive Test Coverage: TDD ensures that all new code is covered by at least one test, leading to more robust software.
# Enhanced Confidence in Code: Developers gain greater confidence in the code&#x27;s reliability and functionality.
# Enhanced Confidence in Tests: As the tests are known to be failing without the proper implementation, we know that the tests actually tests the implementation correctly.
# Well-Documented Code: The process naturally results in well-documented code, as each test clarifies the purpose of the code it tests.
# Requirement Clarity: TDD encourages a clear understanding of requirements before coding begins.
# Facilitates Continuous Integration: It integrates well with continuous integration processes, allowing for frequent code updates and testing.
# Boosts Productivity: Many developers find that TDD increases their productivity.
# Reinforces Code Mental Model: TDD helps in building a strong mental model of the code&#x27;s structure and behavior.
# Emphasis on Design and Functionality: It encourages a focus on the design, interface, and overall functionality of the program.
# Reduces Need for Debugging: By catching issues early in the development process, TDD reduces the need for extensive debugging later.
# System Stability: Applications developed with TDD tend to be more stable and less prone to bugs.

=== Disadvantages ===

However, TDD is not without its drawbacks:

# Increased Code Volume: Implementing TDD can result in a larger codebase as tests add to the total amount of code written.
# False Security from Tests: A large number of passing tests can sometimes give a misleading sense of security regarding the code&#x27;s robustness.
# Maintenance Overheads: Maintaining a large suite of tests can add overhead to the development process.
# Time-Consuming Test Processes: Writing and maintaining tests can be time-consuming.
# Testing Environment Set-Up: TDD requires setting up and maintaining a suitable testing environment.
# Learning Curve: It takes time and effort to become proficient in TDD practices.
# Overcomplication: An overemphasis on TDD can lead to code that is more complex than necessary.
# Neglect of Overall Design: Focusing too narrowly on passing tests can sometimes lead to neglect of the bigger picture in software design.
# Increased Costs: The additional time and resources required for TDD can result in higher development costs.

=== Benefits ===
A 2005 study found that using TDD meant writing more tests and, in turn, programmers who wrote more tests tended to be more productive. Hypotheses relating to code quality and a more direct correlation between TDD and productivity were inconclusive.

Programmers using pure TDD on new (&quot;greenfield&quot;) projects reported they only rarely felt the need to invoke a debugger. Used in conjunction with a version control system, when tests fail unexpectedly, reverting the code to the last version that passed all tests may often be more productive than debugging.

Test-driven development offers more than just simple validation of correctness, but can also drive the design of a program. By focusing on the test cases first, one must imagine how the functionality is used by clients (in the first case, the test cases). So, the programmer is concerned with the interface before the implementation. This benefit is complementary to design by contract as it approaches code through test cases rather than through mathematical assertions or preconceptions.

Test-driven development offers the ability to take small steps when required. It allows a programmer to focus on the task at hand as the first goal is to make the test pass. Exceptional cases and error handling are not considered initially, and tests to create these extraneous circumstances are implemented separately. Test-driven development ensures in this way that all written code is covered by at least one test. This gives the programming team, and subsequent users, a greater level of confidence in the code.

While it is true that more code is required with TDD than without TDD because of the unit test code, the total code implementation time could be shorter based on a model by Müller and Padberg. Large numbers of tests help to limit the number of defects in the code. The early and frequent nature of the testing helps to catch defects early in the development cycle, preventing them from becoming endemic and expensive problems. Eliminating defects early in the process usually avoids lengthy and tedious debugging later in the project.

TDD can lead to more modularized, flexible, and extensible code. This effect often comes about because the methodology requires that the developers think of the software in terms of small units that can be written and tested independently and integrated together later. This leads to smaller, more focused classes, looser coupling, and cleaner interfaces. The use of the mock object design pattern also contributes to the overall modularization of the code because this pattern requires that the code be written so that modules can be switched easily between mock versions for unit testing and &quot;real&quot; versions for deployment.

Because no more code is written than necessary to pass a failing test case, automated tests tend to cover every code path. For example, for a TDD developer to add an codice_4 branch to an existing codice_5 statement, the developer would first have to write a failing test case that motivates the branch. As a result, the automated tests resulting from TDD tend to be very thorough: they detect any unexpected changes in the code&#x27;s behaviour. This detects problems that can arise where a change later in the development cycle unexpectedly alters other functionality.

Madeyski provided empirical evidence (via a series of laboratory experiments with over 200 developers) regarding the superiority of the TDD practice over the traditional Test-Last approach or testing for correctness approach, with respect to the lower coupling between objects (CBO). The mean effect size represents a medium (but close to large) effect on the basis of meta-analysis of the performed experiments which is a substantial finding. It suggests a better modularization (i.e., a more modular design), easier reuse and testing of the developed software products due to the TDD programming practice. Madeyski also measured the effect of the TDD practice on unit tests using branch coverage (BC) and mutation score indicator (MSI), which are indicators of the thoroughness and the fault detection effectiveness of unit tests, respectively. The effect size of TDD on branch coverage was medium in size and therefore is considered substantive effect. These findings have been subsequently confirmed by further, smaller experimental evaluations of TDD.

=== Psychological benefits to programmer ===

# Increased Confidence: TDD allows programmers to make changes or add new features with confidence. Knowing that the code is constantly tested reduces the fear of breaking existing functionality. This safety net can encourage more innovative and creative approaches to problem-solving.
# Reduced Fear of Change, Reduced Stress: In traditional development, changing existing code can be daunting due to the risk of introducing bugs. TDD, with its comprehensive test suite, reduces this fear, as tests will immediately reveal any problems caused by changes. Knowing that the codebase has a safety net of tests can reduce stress and anxiety associated with programming. Developers might feel more relaxed and open to experimenting and refactoring.
# Improved Focus: Writing tests first helps programmers concentrate on requirements and design before writing the code. This focus can lead to clearer, more purposeful coding, as the developer is always aware of the goal they are trying to achieve.
# Sense of Achievement and Job Satisfaction: Passing tests can provide a quick, regular sense of accomplishment, boosting morale. This can be particularly motivating in long-term projects where the end goal might seem distant. The combination of all these factors can lead to increased job satisfaction. When developers feel confident, focused, and part of a collaborative team, their overall job satisfaction can significantly improve.

=== Limitations ===

Test-driven development does not perform sufficient testing in situations where full functional tests are required to determine success or failure, due to extensive use of unit tests. Examples of these are user interfaces, programs that work with databases, and some that depend on specific network configurations. TDD encourages developers to put the minimum amount of code into such modules and to maximize the logic that is in testable library code, using fakes and mocks to represent the outside world.

Management support is essential. Without the entire organization believing that test-driven development is going to improve the product, management may feel that time spent writing tests is wasted.

Unit tests created in a test-driven development environment are typically created by the developer who is writing the code being tested. Therefore, the tests may share blind spots with the code: if, for example, a developer does not realize that certain input parameters must be checked, most likely neither the test nor the code will verify those parameters. Another example: if the developer misinterprets the requirements for the module they are developing, the code and the unit tests they write will both be wrong in the same way. Therefore, the tests will pass, giving a false sense of correctness.

A high number of passing unit tests may bring a false sense of security, resulting in fewer additional software testing activities, such as integration testing and compliance testing.

Tests become part of the maintenance overhead of a project. Badly written tests, for example ones that include hard-coded error strings, are themselves prone to failure, and they are expensive to maintain. This is especially the case with fragile tests. There is a risk that tests that regularly generate false failures will be ignored, so that when a real failure occurs, it may not be detected. It is possible to write tests for low and easy maintenance, for example by the reuse of error strings, and this should be a goal during the code refactoring phase described above.

Writing and maintaining an excessive number of tests costs time. Also, more-flexible modules (with limited tests) might accept new requirements without the need for changing the tests. For those reasons, testing for only extreme conditions, or a small sample of data, can be easier to adjust than a set of highly detailed tests.

The level of coverage and testing detail achieved during repeated TDD cycles cannot easily be re-created at a later date. Therefore, these original, or early, tests become increasingly precious as time goes by. The tactic is to fix it early. Also, if a poor architecture, a poor design, or a poor testing strategy leads to a late change that makes dozens of existing tests fail, then it is important that they are individually fixed. Merely deleting, disabling or rashly altering them can lead to undetectable holes in the test coverage.

<doc id="357885" wikidata="Q1137192" url="?curid=357885" title="Red-necked nightjar">
<text>The red-necked nightjar (Caprimulgus ruficollis) is the largest of the nightjars occurring in Europe. It breeds in Iberia and North Africa, and winters in tropical West Africa.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Caprimulgus&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;capra&quot;, &quot;nanny goat&quot;, and &quot;mulgere&quot;, &quot;to milk&quot;, referring to an old myth that nightjars suck milk from goats. The specific &quot;ruficollis&quot; is from Latin &quot;rufus&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, and &quot;collum&quot;, &quot;neck&quot;.

The common name &quot;nightjar&quot;, first recorded in 1630, refers to the nocturnal habits of the bird, the second part of the name deriving from the distinctive churring song.

There are two subspecies: nominate &quot;ruficollis&quot;, breeding in Iberia, and &quot;desertorum&quot; breeding in North Africa. The North African form &quot;desertorum&quot; is paler than the Iberian one, and has different patterning on the base of its primary feathers: dark and orange bands of approximately equal width, compared to the narrower orange bands and greater extent of black of &quot;ruficollis&quot;.

==Description==
The variegated plumage resembles the European nightjar. The adult is lichen-grey, barred and streaked with buff, chestnut and black. The underparts are barred. It is larger and longer-tailed than the more widespread species, and has a rufous neck-collar. Both sexes have white wing spots, tail sides and throat. During the day this nightjar lies silent upon the ground, concealed by its plumage; it is difficult to detect, looking like a bit of lichen-covered twig or a fragment of bark. The length is 32 cm, and the wingspan 64 cm. Like other nightjars, it has a wide gape, long wings, soft downy plumage and nocturnal habits.

===Call===
Its call is a repetitive mechanical &quot;kyok-kyok-kyok...&quot;, which rises and falls as the bird turns its head from side to side. When it churrs, the bird lies or crouches along a branch or rail, but it will sing from a post. During courtship, and occasionally at other times, it uses a mechanical signal, a sharp cracking sound, caused by clapping the wings together over the back.

==Habitat==
Open sandy heaths with trees or bushes are the haunts of this crepuscular nightjar. It flies at dusk, most often at sundown, with an easy, silent moth-like flight; its strong and deliberate wingbeats alternate with graceful sweeps and wheels with motionless wings. Crepuscular insects, such as moths, are its food.

==Nesting==

It is a late migrant, seldom appearing in the breeding area before the end of April or beginning of May. No nest is made; the two elongated and elliptical eggs are placed upon the bare ground; the brooding bird, sitting closely, is their best protection.

==Status and distribution==

===Vagrancy===
The species has occurred as a vagrant twice in northern Europe, in Northumberland, Britain in October 1856, and in Denmark in 1991. The Northumberland bird was shot at Killingworth on 5 October by a gamekeeper, and the specimen purchased by John Hancock. In 2006, Keith Vinicombe and Dominic Mitchell cast doubt on the British record, believing that the lack of detail around the circumstances of finding indicated that a mistake or fraud could not be ruled out. The British Ornithologists&#x27; Union Records Committee subsequently re-examined the record and came to the conclusion that it should continue to be regarded as acceptable. The British record is a first-autumn bird of the Iberian race &quot;ruficollis&quot;, and the Danish record also appears to be of this form; earlier suggestions that the British bird was of the North African race &quot;desertorum&quot; were erroneous – the specimen&#x27;s paleness being due to fading whilst on public display at the Hancock Museum. There are also several nineteenth-century European records from outside the species&#x27; normal breeding range: from southeast France, Malta, the Canary Islands, Croatia, Israel and Sicily.

<doc id="357891" wikidata="Q6942240" url="?curid=357891" title="Music of Panama">
<text>Panama is a Central American country, inhabited mostly by mestizos (persons of mixed African, European and indigenous ancestry). The music of Panama is heavily based on the folk music of Spain, particularly that of Andalusia and was influenced first by the indigenous populations of Kunas, Teribes, Ngobe Bugle and others, and then by the black population who were brought over, first as slaves from Africa, between the 16th century and the 19th century, and then voluntarily (especially from Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Dominica, Saint Lucia) to work on the Panamanian Railroad and Canal projects between the 1840s and 1914.

With this heritage, Panama has a rich and diverse music history, and important contributions to cumbia, saloma, pasillo, punto, tamborito, mejorana, bolero, jazz, salsa, reggae, calypso, rock, and other musical genres.

== Saloma and mejorana ==
The saloma and mejorana feature a distinctive vocal style said to derive from Sevillians. The most important native instruments used to play these musics are the mejoranera, a five-stringed guitar accompanying songs called mejoranas as well as &quot;torrentes&quot;, and the rabel, a violin with three strings used to play cumbias, puntos and pasillos in the central provinces of Coclé, Herrera, Los Santos and Veraguas.

== Cumbia ==
Closely related to its more well-known Colombian cousin, Panamanian &quot;cumbia&quot;, especially &quot;amanojá&quot; and &quot;atravesao&quot; styles, are domestically popular. Another important music is punto and the salon dances like &quot;pasillo&quot;, &quot;danza&quot; and &quot;contradanza&quot;. During the 19th and 20th centuries, the &quot;Pasillo&quot; music was very popular.

== Tamborito ==
A folk dance, called &quot;tamborito&quot; is very popular. Danced by men and women in costumes, the tamborito is led by a cantalante, a female lead singer, who is backed by a clapping chorus (the &quot;estribillo&quot;) that sings four-line stanzas of &quot;copla&quot; (a lyrical form related to Spanish poetry) as well as three drums.

== Congo ==
A somewhat similar genre called congo is popular among the black communities of the northern coast in Costa Arriba, which includes Portobelo, a province of Colón.

== Tipico ==
Contemporary popular Panama folkloric music is generally called música típico
, or pindín, which since the 1940s has included instruments such as the guiro, conga and especially the accordion, among others. Some famous Panamanian artists in this genre are Aceves Nunez, Teresín Jaén, Ulpiano Vergara, Lucho De Sedas y Juan De Sedas, Dorindo Cárdenas, Victorio Vergara Batista, Roberto &quot;Papi&quot; Brandao, Nenito Vargas, Yin Carrizo, Abdiel Núñez, Manuel de Jesús Abrego, Alejandro Torres and &quot;Samy y Sandra Sandoval&quot;.

== Salsa ==
Panama&#x27;s leading salsa musician, Rubén Blades, has achieved international stardom, after collaborating with other local musicians like Rómulo Castro and Tuira. Other world-famous musicians from Panama included Luis Russell, who played with Louie Armstrong in the 1920s, Mauricio Smith, a noted saxophone and flute player who played with Chubby Checker, Charles Mingus, Dizzy Gillespie, Machito and Mongo Santamaría, among others. Victor &quot;Vitin&quot; Paz, a pillar of the Latin jazz trumpet, was a cornerstone of the Fania All Stars for many years. Gaitanes, La Kshamba, Roberto Delgado and many others.

== Jazz ==
Panama has a long history in jazz, beginning with Luis Russell, pianist, composer and director, who traveled to New Orleans in 1919 and made important contributions. By the 1940s the port city of Colón boasted at least ten local jazz orchestras. Legends of Jazz in Panama included pianist and composer Victor Boa, bassist Clarence Martin, singer Barbara Wilson and French horn player John &quot;Rubberlegs&quot; McKindo. This jazz legacy was recently reinvigorated when the US-based Panamanian pianist Danilo Perez organized the first jazz Festival in January 2004.

== Calypso ==
Panama also boasts a vibrant history of calypso and mento music sung by nationally well-known musicians such as Lord Panama, Lord Delicious, Two-Gun Smokey, Lady Trixie, Lord Kon-Tiki, Lord Kitti, and Lord Cobra and the Pana-Afro sounds.

== Modern times ==
By the 1960s, local doo-wop groups were evolving into what became known as the Combos Nacionales, five to ten musician groups using electric instruments and incorporating the diverse sounds of jazz, calypso, salsa, merengue, doo wop, soul and funk. Famous Combos Nacionales included The Silvertones, The Exciters, The Fabulous Festivals, The Beachers, The Soul Fantastics, Los Mozambiques, The Goombays, Los Juveniles, Roberto y su Zafra and Bush y sus Magnificos. By 1970, the dynamic Combos Nacionales sound dominated Panamanian popular music, only winding down toward the late 1970s.

Reggae en Español originated in Panama, known as Spanish reggae is very popular among youth, and spawned the Spanish language dancehall also known as &quot;reggae en español&quot; (Spanish dancehall) style known as the predecessor to reggaeton, which originated with such artists as El General, Nando Boom, Renato, Mr. Rico, Aldo Ranks, Kafu Banton, Jam &amp; Suppose, Danger Man and Chicho Man, before becoming popular in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and eventually amongst youth in the United States. As of 2006, Panama has become a major source and contributor to reggaeton and, especially as Reggaeton from Panama is on the rise and continues to dominate charts in the United States and abroad.

The Pioneers of the International Reggae en Espanol movement out of Panama were Gary H. Mason aka: Big Daddy G., and Luis &quot;Wicho&quot; Phillips aka: The Karma Master. They introduced and produced the songs &quot;El Meneaito&quot; performed by Gaby, &quot;Soy El Mas Sensual&quot; performed by Renato, &quot;Camión Lleno de Gunn&quot; performed by Jam &amp; Suppose, &quot;El Marciano&quot; performed by Cocoman, as well as hits by Reggae Sam, Aldo Ranks, Toby King, Reggae Kid, and many other well known Panamanian Artists.

While often still referred as Reggae, much of the current Panamanian reggae scene is based in Jamaica&#x27;s dancehall scene. The genre still maintains some of the style of the earlier &quot;reggae en Español&quot;, such as the laidback lyrics and references to everyday life, but some details, like the common practice of taking Jamaican dancehall songs (or even non-dancehall songs, as the case of Benny Benassi&#x27;s Satisfaction) and releasing them with Spanish lyrics but otherwise minor to no differences with the original track, is now often criticized as plagiarism, mainly due to Internet, which has allowed people to have more awareness about a song&#x27;s origins.

One of such artists to often face said criticism is Japanese, who tends to release songs based on viral hits like Gangnam Style or &quot;Moving like Bernie&quot; (a song involving the &quot;Bernie dance&quot; dance moves), or popular songs like Wiggle. This criticism, however, is mostly related to what some people consider &quot;uninspired lyrics&quot;. Some speculate that the plagiarism issue is what keeps Panamanian and Jamaican dancehall scenes rarely colliding in the form of music collaborations, despite the closeness of both cultures.

Parallel to this, reggae influences in Panama have also spawned several popular reggae roots bands, such as Cellula, Pureza Natural, Raices y Cultura, Inspiración Mística, Panta Rey, among others. While reggae entered the country through Antillian immigrants, it has reached all sorts of people, like Mestizo singer from Coclé I-Nesta, who has experimented with traditional reggae roots, dancehall and even reggae fusion, and has collaborated with Argentinian reggae singer Fidel Nadal. Reggae roots remains popular among Panamanian youth of different regions, classes and races, specially among Rastas and secular weed subculture.

A thriving and very popular &quot;rock en español&quot; scene has produced such groups as Orquesta Garash, Radicales Libres, Filtro Medusa, Skamilonga, Los Rabanes, Xantos Jorge, Cage 9, Factor VIII, Os Almirantes, Nervial, Los 33, Señor Loop, Roba Morena, Out-reazon, Lemmiwinks, Skraped Knees, Calibre 57, ROGAM, Cabeza De Martillo, just to name a few. Solo artists like Cienfue and Horacio Valdés have also proved popular.

In recent years, the Electronic Dance Music scene of Panama has flourished, not being restricted just to concerts by David Guetta or Tiësto, but having full-fledged electronic music festivals like The Day After, which have featured famous EDM acts like Afrojack, Nervo, Martin Garrix, W&amp;W and the like. Some national electronic music producers have appeared; however, the development of the producer scene is at a much earlier stage than its fanbase, partly because of the country&#x27;s music labels focus on dancehall and its subgenres. However, a well-known Dancehall producer from the country, Predikador, has had an experimental venture on electronic dance genres in his &quot;2050&quot; series of sequentially named tracks, which have drawn from the popular EDM genres at the time each track was made (namely, Dubstep and Big Room House).

Also worth mentioning is Pedro Altamiranda and his historically popular music spanning several generations and political moments. His songs have a comedic tone and are often satirical; some of which have been banned by leaders like Manuel Noriega. Despite this, his influence has persisted, and many popular phrases and slang used in Panama are lyrics from Altamiranda&#x27;s songs.

<text>Strategic Simulations, Inc. (SSI) was a video game developer and publisher of over 100 games from its founding in 1979 to its dissolution in 1994 (though the brand was in use until around 2002). The company focused on computer wargames then later added role-playing video games. SSI published the &quot;Panzer General&quot; series and the official video game adaptations of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.

==History==
The company was founded by Joel Billings, a wargame enthusiast, who in the summer of 1979 saw the possibility of using the new home computers such as the TRS-80 for wargames. While unsuccessfully approaching Avalon Hill and Automated Simulations to publish wargames, he hired programmers John Lyons, who wrote &quot;Computer Bismarck&quot;—later claimed to have been the first &quot;serious wargame&quot; published for a microcomputer—and Ed Williger, who wrote &quot;Computer Ambush&quot;. Both games were written in BASIC as were many of SSI&#x27;s early games.

Although Billings expected that he and Lyon would write the first version of &quot;Computer Bismarck&quot; on a North Star computer, Apple Computer executive Trip Hawkins, who would later found Electronic Arts, persuaded Billings to switch to the Apple II because of its graphics. &quot;Computer Bismarck&quot; appeared for the Apple in January 1980 and for the TRS-80 later in the year. Chuck Kroegel, who joined the company as an employee in 1983, was the co-author with David Landrey of many of the early SSI wargames and led product development for over ten years.

By late 1980, SSI advertised that its games could &quot;take you from Waterloo to the Super Bowl. (By way of the North Atlantic.)&quot; In 1982 SSI launched their &quot;RapidFire&quot; line. Although the name implies action titles, it was in fact simply a branding of games being written by third party authors. The initial series consisted of &quot;Cytron Masters&quot;, &quot;The Cosmic Balance&quot; and &quot;Galactic Gladiators&quot;. Later titles included &quot;Epidemic!&quot;, a real time strategy title dealing with a global plague, &quot;Queen of Hearts&quot;, &quot;Cosmic Balance II&quot;, &quot;Broadsides&quot; and others. The branding effort did not last very long, and appeared to have been ended in either 1983 or 1984. Chris Smith reviewed SSI&#x27;s &quot;RapidFire Line&quot; in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 59. Smith commented that &quot; RapidFire is a game line that deserves any award it can be nominated for. It is the best line of computer games I&#x27;ve ever seen, and the programs rate high on an individual basis also.&quot;

By 1985, &quot;Antic&quot; wrote &quot;serious computer wargamers consider [SSI] a company in a class by itself&quot;. It had 60 employees and had published 12 games in the previous year, most written in compiled BASIC. Developers such as Gary Grigsby received royalties of up to $20,000 per game. By fiscal 1987 the company had $5 million in sales, and had released 89 games in its first eight years.

SSI had expanded into role-playing games in 1984 with titles such as &quot;Wizard&#x27;s Crown&quot;, &quot;Questron&quot; and the &quot;Phantasie&quot; series. In 1987, SSI acquired the &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (AD&amp;D) license from TSR and subsequently published 30 titles in that series, starting with &quot;Pool of Radiance&quot; in 1988 and including &quot;War of the Lance&quot; in 1989 (Apple II) and 1990 (MS-DOS &amp; Commodore 64). The TSR products formed the core of games released using the Gold Box engine.

By 1992, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated that SSI &quot;is no longer known as, primarily, a wargame company [but] continues to publish its share of wargames&quot;. In 1994, the company released &quot;Panzer General&quot;. Panzer General was a very approachable and easy-to-play game that nevertheless had some gameplay depth and the sense of continuity and goals. It was followed by three other games based on slightly modified versions of the basic engine, including &quot;Allied General&quot; and &quot;Pacific General&quot;, the latter arguably being the most balanced. Non-historical games based on the same system were also released, &quot;Star General&quot; and &quot;Fantasy General&quot;. These were later referred to collectively as the &quot;5-Star General Series&quot;.

As the newer versions were released over a three-year period they increasingly became outdated in terms of improving computer hardware. In 1997 they released a new version, &quot;Panzer General II&quot;, with hand-painted maps and icons. It was very popular, selling well over 100,000 copies in its first release, and is still modded and played today. &quot;People&#x27;s General&quot; was based on the same engine. In 1999 &quot;Panzer General 3D Assault&quot; introduced a true 3D engine, but gameplay was not particularly notable. A final attempt in 2000 was &quot;Panzer General III: Scorched Earth&quot;.

SSI was acquired by Mindscape in 1994, spent some time as part of Mattel, and finally became part of Ubisoft in March 2001, which retired the brand a few years later.

In December 2013, Joel Billings donated several SSI video games, such as &quot;Computer Bismarck&quot;, including the source code for preservation to the ICHEG.

<doc id="357896" wikidata="Q231603" url="?curid=357896" title="Sei Shōnagon">
<text>was a Japanese author, poet, and a court lady who served the Empress Teishi (Sadako) around the year 1000 during the middle Heian period. She is the author of .

==Name==
Sei Shōnagon&#x27;s actual given name is not known. It was the custom among aristocrats in those days to call a court lady by a nickname taken from a court office belonging to her father or husband. derives from her father&#x27;s family name &quot;Kiyohara&quot; (the native Japanese reading of the first character is , while the Sino-Japanese reading is ), while refers to a government post. Her relationship to this post is unknown, though—neither her father nor either of her two husbands held such a post. has suggested that it may have belonged to a third husband, perhaps Fujiwara no Nobuyoshi.

Her actual name has been a topic of debate among scholars, and the name is a possibility.

==Early life==
Little is known about her life except what can be found in her writing. She was the daughter of Kiyohara no Motosuke, a scholar and well-known poet, who worked as a provincial official. Her grandfather Kiyohara no Fukayabu was also a poet. The family were middle-ranking courtiers and had financial difficulties, possibly because they were not granted a revenue-producing office.

She married Tachibana no Norimitsu, a government official at 16, and gave birth to a son, Norinaga. In 993, at 27, when she began to serve the Empress Teishi, consort of Emperor Ichijō, she may have been divorced. When her court service ended she may have married Fujiwara no Muneyo, governor of Settsu province, and had a daughter, Koma no Myobu, although some evidence suggests she became a Buddhist nun.

Hiroaki Sato questions whether Lady Sei and Norimitsu were actually married or just close friends, &quot;the ladies and gentlemen of the court teased them by calling him her big brother and her his little sister.&quot;

==Rival==
Shōnagon is also known for her rivalry with her contemporary, writer and court lady Murasaki Shikibu, author of &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; who served the Empress Shoshi, second consort of the Emperor Ichijō. Murasaki Shikibu wrote about Shōnagon – somewhat scathingly, though conceding Shōnagon&#x27;s literary gifts – in her diary, &quot;The Diary of Lady Murasaki&quot;.

==Writing==

Shōnagon became popular through her work &quot;The Pillow Book&quot;, a collection of lists, gossip, poetry, observations and complaints written during her years in the court, a miscellaneous genre of writing known as . Shōnagon&#x27;s essays describe the various daily experiences and customs of the time, and the affairs of the Imperial Court in Kyoto where she lived, from a unique point of view. &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; was circulated at court, and for several hundred years existed in handwritten manuscripts. First printed in the 17th century, it exists in different versions: the order of entries may have been changed by scribes with comments and passages added, edited, or deleted. Four main variants of the text are known to modern scholars. The two considered to be the most complete and accurate are the Sankanbon and Nōinbon texts. Later editors introduced section numbers and divisions; the Sankanbon text is divided into 297 sections, with an additional 29 supplemental sections which may represent later additions by the author or copyists.

In &quot;The Pillow Book&quot;, Shōnagon writes about Empress Teishi, and her disappointment after her father&#x27;s death when Fujiwara no Michinaga made his daughter Shōshi consort to Ichijō, and then empress, making Teishi one of two empresses at court. Because of the risk of fire, the Imperial family did not live in the Heian Palace. Empress Teishi resided in a part of , the &quot;Bureau of Serving the (Middle) Empress&quot;, and moved to other residences as circumstances changed. Shōnagon writes with apparent lightheartedness about events at court, de-emphasizing or omitting harsh realities such as Teishi&#x27;s death from childbirth in 1001. According to the prevalent fashion, to have written more passionately would have been considered unstylish. Her writing is considered witty, depicting Teishi&#x27;s elegant court from a detailed, gossipy perspective.

Shōnagon was regarded by contemporary courtiers as having an excellent memory. Her writing includes many reminiscences of events at court, often including precise details such as the clothes people wore, despite being written down several years after the events took place. She was also known to be especially adept at recalling and quoting a classic poem to suit the occasion, even by the standards of a court in which knowledge of the poetry canon was considered an essential skill.

The entries in &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; on rhetoric include advice and opinions on conversation, preaching, and letter writing. Shōnagon advocates pure language and rigorous use of formalities in the sections of advice on conversation, but also offers vignettes showing witty repartee and sociable give-and-take among the empress&#x27;s ladies and between ladies and gentlemen. Shōnagon also touches upon the topic of preaching; priests who preach should be handsome and well trained in elocution, with excellent memories, and their audiences should be attentive and polite individuals who do not come to services to flirt and show off. She says that one can become distracted and inattentive when the priest is unattractive, but when he is good-looking one remains focused on his face, and as such better experiences the holiness of his sermons. Later, she offers detailed information on letter writing, offering prescriptions for paper, calligraphy, accompanying gift and bearer, and appreciation for the value of letters as gifts of love. In particular, Shōnagon paid special attention to &quot;morning-after letters&quot;. In Japanese court society, sex between courtiers was illicit but happened very often. A social requirement was that the male send a poem on beautiful paper with a decorative flower or branch to the lady, and that she reply. Shōnagon goes in depth about this subject matter in her section called, &quot;Things That Make One Nervous.&quot;

One of her is included in the famous anthology Ogura Hyakunin Isshu as No. 62.

==Later years==
There are no details about Shōnagon&#x27;s life after the year 1017, and very few records of her after the death of the Empress Teishi/Empress Sadako in 1000. According to one tradition, she lived out her twilight years in poverty as a Buddhist nun. Another tradition has her marrying Fujiwara no Muneyo, the governor of Settsu province, after her court service ended, and having a daughter, Koma no Myobu. &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; is thought to have been finished sometime between 1001 and 1010, while Shōnagon was in retirement.

<doc id="357902" wikidata="Q615437" url="?curid=357902" title="Egyptian nightjar">
<text>The Egyptian nightjar (Caprimulgus aegyptius) is a medium-small nightjar which occurs in south west Asia and north Africa and winters in tropical Africa. This is a fairly common species with a wide distribution which faces no obvious threats apart from habitat destruction, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

==Etymology==
The genus name &quot;Caprimulgus&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;capra&quot;, &quot;nanny goat&quot;, and &quot;mulgere&quot;, &quot;to milk&quot;, referring to an old myth that nightjars suck milk from goats. The specific &quot;aegyptius&quot; is Latin for &quot;Egyptian&quot;.&quot;. The common name &quot;nightjar&quot;, first recorded in 1630, refers to the nocturnal habits of the bird, the second part of the name deriving from the distinctive churring song.

==Description==

The variegated plumage is much paler than the European nightjar. The adult is sand-coloured, barred and streaked with buff and brown. The under parts are sandy or whitish. It is smaller, but relatively longer-winged and longer-tailed than the more widespread species. Like other nightjars, it has a wide gape, long wings, soft downy plumage and nocturnal habits. The male has tiny white wing spots. The length is 25 cm, and the wingspan 55 cm. Its call is a repetitive mechanical &quot;kroo-kroo-kroo…&quot;, which rises and falls as the bird turns its head from side to side.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Egyptian nightjar is native to northern Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East. Its range includes Afghanistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Chad, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Libya, Mali, Mauritania, Morocco, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, South Sudan, Sudan, Tajikistan, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and Yemen. It is a rare visitor to Europe, and has occurred as a vagrant in Denmark, Germany, Italy, Malta, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Its typical habitat is open desert with a few scattered trees or bushes. It is often found near water in areas with sparse vegetation and scrub. Over-wintering birds in Sudan can be found in areas with long grass.

==Ecology==
During the day, this crepuscular nightjar lies silent upon the ground, concealed by its plumage; it is difficult to detect, blending in with the sandy soil. It flies at dusk, most often at sundown, with an easy, silent moth-like flight; its strong and deliberate wingbeats alternate with sweeps and glides with motionless wings. Crepuscular insects, such as moths, are its food. No nest is made; the two elongated and elliptical eggs are placed upon the bare ground; the brooding bird, sitting closely, is their best protection. The population in northwestern Africa breeds in the desert and sandy steppe where there are areas with limestone outcrops, and overwinter in dry countryside with &quot;Artemisia&quot;, &quot;Tamarix&quot; and &quot;Salsola&quot;.

<doc id="357909" wikidata="Q426875" url="?curid=357909" title="Mulberry harbours">
<text>The Mulberry harbours were two temporary portable harbours developed by the British Admiralty and War Office during the Second World War to facilitate the rapid offloading of cargo onto beaches during the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944. They were designed in 1942 then built in under a year in great secrecy; within hours of the Allies creating beachheads after D-Day, sections of the two prefabricated harbours were towed across the English Channel from southern England and placed in position off Omaha Beach (Mulberry &quot;A&quot;) and Gold Beach (Mulberry &quot;B&quot;), along with old ships to be sunk as breakwaters.

The Mulberry harbours solved the problem of needing deepwater jetties and a harbour to provide the invasion force with the necessary reinforcements and supplies, and were to be used until major French ports could be captured and brought back into use after repair of the inevitable sabotage by German defenders. Comprising floating but sinkable breakwaters, floating pontoons, piers and floating roadways, this innovative and technically difficult system was being used for the first time.

The Mulberry B harbour at Gold Beach was used for ten months after D-Day, while over two million men, four million tons of supplies and half a million vehicles were landed before it was fully decommissioned. The partially completed Mulberry A harbour at Omaha Beach was damaged on 19 June by a violent storm that arrived from the northeast before the pontoons were securely anchored. After three days the storm finally abated and damage was found to be so severe that the harbour was abandoned and the Americans resorted to landing men and material over the open beaches.

==Background==
The Dieppe Raid of 1942 had shown that the Allies could not rely on being able to penetrate the Atlantic Wall to capture a port on the north French coast. The problem was that large ocean-going ships of the type needed to transport heavy and bulky cargoes and stores needed sufficient depth of water under their keels, together with dockside cranes, to offload their cargo. These were only available at the already heavily defended French harbours. Thus, the Mulberries were created to provide the port facilities necessary to offload the thousands of men and vehicles and millions of tons of supplies necessary to sustain Operation Overlord. The harbours were made up of all the elements one would expect of any harbour: breakwater, piers and roadways.

==Preparation==

With the planning of Operation Overlord at an advanced stage by the summer of 1943, it was accepted that the proposed artificial harbours would need to be prefabricated in Britain and then towed across the English Channel.

The need for two separate artificial harbours – one American and one British/Canadian – was agreed at the Quebec Conference in August 1943. An Artificial Harbours Sub-Committee was set up under the Chairmanship of the civil engineer Colin R. White, brother of Sir Bruce White, to advise on the location of the harbours and the form of the breakwater; the Sub-Committee&#x27;s first meeting was held at the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) on 4 August 1943. The minutes of the Sub-Committee&#x27;s meetings show that initially it was envisaged that bubble breakwaters would be used, then blockships were proposed, and finally, because not enough block ships were available, a mix of blockships and purpose-made concrete caisson units were used.

On 2 September 1943 the Combined Chiefs of Staff estimated that the artificial ports (Mulberries) would need to handle 12,000 tons per day, exclusive of motor transport, and in all weathers. On 4 September the go-ahead was given to start work immediately on the harbours. Infighting between the War Office and the Admiralty over responsibility was only resolved on 15 December 1943 by the intervention of the Vice-Chiefs of Staff. The decision was that the Admiralty managed the blockships, bombardons and assembly of all constituent parts on the south coast of England. It would also undertake all necessary work to survey, site, tow and mark navigation. The War Office was given the task of constructing the concrete caissons (phoenixes), the roadways (whales) and protection via anti-aircraft installations. Once at the site, the army was responsible for sinking the caissons and assembling all the various other units of the harbours. For the Mulberry A at Omaha Beach, the US Navy Civil Engineer Corps (CEC) would construct the harbour from prefabricated parts.

The proposed harbours called for many huge caissons of various sorts to build breakwaters and piers and connecting structures to provide the roadways. The caissons were built at a number of locations, mainly existing ship building facilities or large beaches, like Conwy Morfa, around the British coast. The works were let out to commercial construction firms, including Wates Construction, Balfour Beatty, Henry Boot, Bovis &amp; Co, Cochrane &amp; Sons, Costain, Cubitts, French, Holloway Brothers, John Laing &amp; Son, Peter Lind &amp; Company, Sir Robert McAlpine, Melville Dundas &amp; Whitson, Mowlem, Nuttall, Parkinson, Halcrow Group, Pauling &amp; Co. and Taylor Woodrow. On completion they were towed across the English Channel by tugboats to the Normandy coast at only and assembled, operated and maintained by the Corps of Royal Engineers, under the guidance of Reginald D. Gwyther, who was appointed CBE for his efforts. Various elements of the whale piers were designed and constructed by a group of companies led by Braithwaite &amp; Co, West Bromwich and Newport.

===Beach surveys===
Both locations for the temporary harbours required detailed information concerning geology, hydrography and sea conditions. To collect this data a special team of hydrographers was created in October 1943. The 712th Survey Flotilla, operating from naval base HMS &quot;Tormentor&quot; in Hamble, were detailed to collect soundings off the enemy coast. Between November 1943 and January 1944 this team used a number of specially adapted Landing Craft Personnel (Large), or LCP(L), to survey the Normandy coast.

The LCP(L)s were manned by a Royal Navy crew and a small group of hydrographers. The first sortie, Operation KJF, occurred on the night of 26/27 November 1943 when three LCP(L)s took measurements off the port of Arromanches, the location for Mulberry B. A follow-up mission, Operation KJG, to the proposed location for Mulberry A happened over 1 and 2 December but a navigation failure meant the team sounded an area 2,250 yards west of the correct area.

Two attempts to take soundings were made off Pointe de Ver. The first sortie, Operation Bellpush Able, on 25/26 December had problems with their equipment. They returned on 28/29 December, in Operation Bellpush Baker, to complete the task.

(On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1943, the 712th Survey Flotilla carried a Combined Operations Pilotage Party (COPP) to the Gold Beach area just west of Ver-sur-Mer. Two soldiers – Major Logan Scott-Bowden, of the Royal Engineers, and commando Sergeant Bruce Ogden Smith, of the East Surrey Regiment – landed on the beach at night in Operation KJH and took samples of the sand. This operation was to check the load-bearing capabilities of sand and help determine whether armoured vehicles would be able to cross the beach or become bogged down, rather than being in connection with the Mulberry harbours.)

The final Mulberry harbour survey, Operation Bellpush Charlie, occurred on the night of 30–31 January but limited information was gathered due to fog and because German lookouts heard the craft. Further sorties were abandoned.

==Design and development==

An early idea for temporary harbours was sketched by Winston Churchill in a 1915 memo to Lloyd George. This memo was for artificial harbours to be created off the German islands of Borkum and Sylt. No further investigation was made and the memo was filed away.

In 1940 the civil engineer Guy Maunsell wrote to the War Office with a proposal for an artificial harbour, but the idea was not at first adopted.
Churchill issued his memo &quot;Piers for use on beaches&quot; on 30 May 1942, apparently in some frustration at the lack of progress being made on finding a solution to the temporary harbour problem. Between 17 June and 6 August 1942, Hugh Iorys Hughes submitted a design concept for artificial harbours to the War Office.

At a meeting following the Dieppe Raid of 19 August 1942, Vice-Admiral John Hughes-Hallett (the naval commander for the Dieppe Raid) declared that if a port could not be captured, then one should be taken across the Channel. Hughes-Hallett had the support of Churchill. The concept of Mulberry harbours began to take shape when Hughes-Hallett moved to be Naval Chief of Staff to the Overlord planners.

In the autumn of 1942, the Chief of Combined Operations Vice-Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, outlined the requirement for piers at least long at which a continuous stream of supplies could be handled, including a pier head capable of handling 2,000-ton ships.

In July 1943 a committee of eminent civil engineers consisting of Colin R White (chairman), J D C Couper, J A Cochrane, R D Gwyther and Lt. Col. Ivor Bell was established to advise on how a number of selected sites on the French coastline could be converted into sheltered harbours. The committee initially investigated the use of compressed air breakwaters before eventually deciding on blockships and caissons.

===Trials===
In August and September 1943 a trial of three competing designs for the cargo-handling jetties was set up together with a test of a compressed air breakwater. The pier designs were by:
* Hugh Iorys Hughes (a civil engineer) who developed his &quot;Hippo&quot; piers and &quot;Crocodile&quot; bridge spans;
* Ronald Hamilton (working at the Department of Miscellaneous Weapons Development) who devised the &quot;Swiss roll&quot; which consisted of a floating roadway made of waterproofed canvas stiffened with slats and tensioned by cables;
* Lieutenant Colonel William T Everall and Major Allan Beckett (of the War Office&#x27;s &#x27;Transportation 5 Department&#x27; (Tn5)) who designed a floating bridge linked to a pier head (the latter had integral &#x27;spud&#x27; legs that were raised and lowered with the tide).

The western side of Wigtown Bay, in the Solway Firth, was selected for the trials as the tides were similar to those on the expected invasion beaches in Normandy, a harbour was available at Garlieston, and the area&#x27;s remoteness would simplify security matters. A headquarters camp was erected at Cairn Head, about south of Garlieston. Prototypes of each of the designs were built and transported to the area for testing by Royal Engineers, based at Cairn Head and in Garlieston. The tests revealed various problems (the &quot;Swiss roll&quot; would only take up to a seven-ton truck in the Atlantic swell). The final choice of design was determined by a storm during which the &quot;Hippos&quot; were undermined causing the &quot;Crocodile&quot; bridge spans to fail and the Swiss roll was washed away. Tn5&#x27;s design proved the most successful and Beckett&#x27;s floating roadway (subsequently codenamed whale) survived undamaged; the design was adopted and of whale roadway were manufactured under the management of J. D. Bernal and Brigadier Bruce White, the Director of Ports and Inland Water Transport at the War Office.

== Elements ==
Mulberry was the codename for all the various structures that created the artificial harbours. These were called gooseberries, which metamorphosed into fully fledged harbours. Mulberry &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; each consisted of a floating outer breakwater called a bombardons, a static breakwater consisting of &quot;corncobs&quot; and reinforced concrete caissons called phoenix breakwaters, floating piers or roadways codenamed whales and beetles and pier heads codenamed spuds. These harbours when built were both of a similar size to Dover harbour. In the planning of Operation Neptune the term Mulberry &quot;B&quot; was defined as &quot;an artificial harbour to be built in England and towed to the British beaches at Arromanches&quot;.

The Mulberry harbour assembled on Omaha Beach at Saint-Laurent-sur-Mer was for use by the American invasion forces. Mulberry &quot;A&quot; (American) was not as securely anchored to the sea bed as Mulberry &quot;B&quot; had been by the British, resulting in such severe damage during the Channel storm of June 19, 1944 that it was considered to be irreparable and its further assembly ceased, It was commanded by Augustus Dayton Clark.

Mulberry &quot;B&quot; (British) was the harbour assembled on Gold Beach at Arromanches for use by the British and Canadian invasion forces. The harbour was decommissioned six months after D-Day, when Allied forces could use the recently captured port of Antwerp to offload troops and supplies. Mulberry &quot;B&quot; was operated by 20 Port Group, Royal Engineers, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel G.C.B Shaddick.

===Breakwaters===
====Corncobs and gooseberries====
Corncobs were 61 ships that crossed the English Channel (either under their own steam or towed) and were then scuttled to act as breakwaters and create sheltered water at the five landing beaches. Once in position the corncobs created the sheltered waters known as gooseberries.

The ships used for each beach were:
* Utah Beach (Gooseberry 1, 10 ships): , &quot;David O. Saylor&quot;, &quot;George S. Wasson&quot;, &quot;Matt W. Ransom&quot;, , , , &quot;Willis A. Slater&quot;, &quot;Victory Sword&quot; and &quot;Vitruvius&quot;.
* Omaha Beach (Gooseberry 2, 15 ships): &quot;Artemas Ward&quot;, , &quot;Baialoide&quot;, , &quot;Courageous&quot;, &quot;Flight-Command&quot;, &quot;Galveston&quot;, &quot;George W. Childs&quot;, &quot;James W. Marshall&quot;, &quot;James Iredell&quot; &quot;Illinoian&quot;, &quot;Olambala&quot;, &quot;Potter&quot;, and &quot;Wilscox&quot;.
* Gold Beach (Gooseberry 3, 16 ships): &quot;Alynbank&quot;, &quot;Alghios Spyridon&quot;, &quot;Elswick Park&quot;, &quot;Flowergate&quot;, &quot;Giorgios P.&quot;, &quot;Ingman&quot;, &quot;Innerton&quot;, &quot;Lynghaug&quot;, &quot;Modlin&quot;, &quot;Njegos&quot;, &quot;Parkhaven&quot;, &quot;Parklaan&quot;, &quot;Saltersgate&quot;, &quot;Sirehei&quot;, &quot;Vinlake&quot; and &quot;Winha&quot;.
* Juno Beach (Gooseberry 4, 11 ships): &quot;Belgique&quot;, &quot;Bendoran&quot;, , &quot;Empire Flamingo&quot;, &quot;Empire Moorhen&quot;, &quot;Empire Waterhen&quot;, &quot;Formigny&quot;, &quot;Manchester Spinner&quot;, &quot;Mariposa&quot;, &quot;Panos&quot; and &quot;Vera Radcliffe&quot;.
* Sword Beach (Gooseberry 5, 9 ships ): &quot;Becheville&quot;, , , , , &quot;Empire Tamar&quot;, &quot;Empire Tana&quot;, &quot;Forbin&quot; and HNLMS &quot;Sumatra&quot;.

====Phoenix caissons====
Phoenixes were reinforced concrete caissons constructed by civil engineering contractors around the coast of Britain, collected and sunk at Dungeness in Kent and Pagham Harbour in West Sussex prior to D-Day. There were six different sizes of caisson (with displacements of approximately 2,000 tons to 6,000 tons each) and each unit was towed to Normandy by two tugs at around three knots. The caissons were initially planned to be moored along the coast, but due to a lack of mooring capacity they were sunk awaiting D-Day, and then refloated (&quot;resurrected&quot;, hence the name).

The Royal Engineers were responsible for the task, and questions had arisen about whether their plans were adequate. US Navy Captain (later Rear Admiral) Edward Ellsberg, a known expert in marine salvage, was brought in to review the plans and determined that they were not. The supplied pumps were designed for moving large volumes of sewage horizontally, and were incapable of providing the necessary lift to pump the water up and out of the caissons.

Ellsberg&#x27;s report resulted in Churchill&#x27;s intervention, taking the task away from the Royal Engineers and giving it to the Royal Navy. Newly-appointed commodore Sinclair McKenzie was put in charge and quickly assembled every salvage barge in the British Isles. The phoenixes, once refloated, were towed across the channel to form the &quot;Mulberry&quot; harbour breakwaters together with the gooseberry block ships. Ellsberg rode one of the concrete caissons to Normandy; once there he helped unsnarl wrecked landing craft and vehicles on the beach.

====Bombardons====

The bombardons were large by plus-shaped floating breakwaters fabricated in steel and rubberized canvas that were anchored outside the main breakwaters that consisted of gooseberries (scuttled ships) and phoenixes (concrete caissons. Twenty-four bombardon units, attached to one another with hemp ropes, created breakwaters. During the storms at the end of June 1944. some broke up and sank while others parted their anchors and drifted down onto the harbours, possibly causing more damage than the storm itself. Their design was the responsibility of the Royal Navy; the Royal Engineers designed the rest of the Mulberry harbour equipment.

===Roadways===
====Whales====

The dock piers were codenamed whales. They were the floating roadways that connected the &quot;spud&quot; pier heads to the land. Designed by Allan Beckett, the roadways were made from innovative torsionally flexible bridging units that had a span of , mounted on pontoon units of either steel or concrete called &quot;beetles&quot;. After the war many of the &quot;Whale&quot; bridge spans from Arromanches were used to repair bombed bridges in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Such units are still visible as a bridge over the Noireau river in Normandy, Meuse River in Vacherauville (Meuse), as a bridge over the Moselle River on road D56 between Cattenom and Kœnigsmacker (Moselle) and in Vierville-sur-Mer (Calvados) along road D517. In 1954, some whales were also used to build two bridges (still visible) in Cameroon along the Edea to Kribi road. In the 1960s, three whale spans from Arromanches were used at Ford Dagenham for cars to drive from the assembly line directly onto ships. A span from Mulberry B reused after the war at Pont-Farcy was saved from destruction in 2008 by &quot;Les Amis du Pont Bailey&quot;, a group of English and French volunteers. Seeking a permanent home for it, they gifted it to the Imperial War Museum and it was returned to England in July 2015. After conservation work it is now part of the Land Warfare exhibition at Imperial War Museum Duxford.

====Beetles====
Beetles were pontoons that supported the Whale piers. War work by the Butterley Company included the production of steel &quot;pontoons used to support the floating bridge between the offshore Mulberry Harbour caissons and the shore on Gold and Omaha beaches after D-Day 1944&quot;. Roy Christian wrote: &quot;The workers who made mysterious floats had no idea of their ultimate purpose until one morning in June 1944 they realised that their products were helping to support the Mulberry Harbour off the low coastline of Normandy, and by that time they were busy building pontoon units and Bailey bridge panels ready for the breakthrough into Germany. But if they were often in the dark about the purpose and destination of the products over which they toiled for days in workshop, forge and foundry, they understood their importance. No time was lost through the war years on strikes or disputes, and absenteeism was low.
Some of those workers were women, for in the first time in its history female labour was being employed at the Butterley works.&quot; 420 concrete pontoons were made by Wates Ltd. at their Barrow in Furness, West India Docks, Marchwood and Beaulieu sites. A further 40 concrete beetles were made by John Laing (for Wates)at their Southsea factory and 20 were made at R. Costain at Erith, Twelve were made by John Mowlem at Russia Dock as were 8 by Melville Dundas and Whiston. They were moored in position using wires attached to &quot;Kite&quot; anchors which were also designed by Allan Beckett. These anchors had such high holding power that few could be recovered at the end of the war. The Navy was dismissive of Beckett&#x27;s claims for his anchor&#x27;s holding ability so Kite anchors were not used for mooring the bombardons. An original Kite anchor is displayed in a private museum at Vierville-sur-Mer while a full size replica forms part of a memorial to Beckett in Arromanches. In October 2018 five Kite anchors were recovered from the bed of the Solent off Woodside Beach, which had been an assembly area for Whale tows prior to D Day. The anchors were taken to Mary Rose Archaeological Services in Portsmouth for conservation treatment.

===Spuds===
The pier heads or landing wharves at which ships were unloaded were codenamed spuds. Each consisted of a pontoon with four legs that rested on the sea bed to anchor it while it could float up and down freely with the tide.

==Deployment==
Components for the Mulberry harbours were constructed at many different locations in Britain, before being transferred to assembly points off the south coast. Then on the afternoon of 6 June 1944 (D-Day) over 400 towed component parts (weighing approximately 1.5 million tons) set sail to create the two Mulberry harbours. It included all the blockships (codenamed Corncobs) to create the outer breakwater (gooseberries) and 146 concrete caissons (phoenixes).

===Arromanches===
At Arromanches, the first phoenix was sunk at dawn on 8 June 1944. By 15 June a further 115 had been sunk to create a five-mile-long arc between Tracy-sur-Mer in the west to Asnelles in the east. To protect the new anchorage, the superstructures of the blockships (which remained above sea-level) and the concrete caissons were festooned with anti-aircraft guns and barrage balloons manned by the men of the 397th and 481st Anti-Aircraft Artillery (Automatic Weapons) Battalions, attached to the First US Army.

===Omaha===
Arriving first on D-Day were the bombardons, followed a day later by the first blockship. The first phoenix was sunk on 9 June and the gooseberry was finished by 11 June. By 18 June two piers and four pier heads were working. Though this harbour was abandoned in late June (see below), the beach continued to be used for landing vehicles and stores using Landing Ship Tanks (LSTs). Using this method, the Americans were able to unload a higher tonnage of supplies than at Arromanches. Salvageable parts of the artificial port were sent to Arromanches to repair the Mulberry there.

===Storm===
Both harbours were almost fully functional when on 19 June a nor&#x27;easter of force 6 to 8 blew into Normandy and devastated the Mulberry harbour at Omaha Beach. The harbours had been designed with summer weather conditions in mind, but this was the worst storm to hit the Normandy coast in 40 years.

The entire harbour at Omaha was deemed irreparable, 21 of the 28 phoenix caissons were completely destroyed, the bombardons were cast adrift and the roadways and piers lay smashed.

The Mulberry harbour at Arromanches was more protected, and although damaged by the storm, it remained usable. It came to be known as Port Winston. While the harbour at Omaha was destroyed sooner than expected, Port Winston saw heavy use for eight months, despite being designed to last only three months. In the ten months after D-Day, it was used to land almost three million men, four million tons of supplies and half a million vehicles to reinforce France. In response to this longer-than-planned use, the phoenix breakwater was reinforced with the addition of specially strengthened caissons. The Royal Engineers had built a complete Mulberry Harbour out of 600,000 tons of concrete between 33 jetties, and had of floating roadways to land men and vehicles on the beach. Port Winston is commonly upheld as one of the best examples of military engineering. Its remains are still visible today from the beaches at Arromanches.

== Post-war analysis ==
Although it was a success, the vast resources used on the Mulberry may have been wasted, as the American forces were supplied mostly over the beaches without the use of a Mulberry right through to September 1944. By the end of 6 June, 20,000 troops and 1,700 vehicles had landed on Utah beach (the shortest beach). At Omaha and Utah, 6,614 tons of cargo was discharged in the first three days. A month after D-Day, Omaha and Utah were handling 9,200 tons, and after a further month, they were landing 16,000 tons per day. This increased until 56,200 tons of supplies, 20,000 vehicles, and 180,000 troops were discharged each day at those beaches. The Mulberry harbours provided less than half the total (on good weather days) to begin with. The Normandy beaches supplied the following average daily tonnage of supplies:
By the end of June, over 289,827 tons of supplies had been offloaded onto the Normandy beaches. Up to September, U.S. forces were supported largely across the beaches, primarily without the use of the Mulberry. &quot;However, in the critical early stage of the operation, had the Allied assault ships been caught in the open without the benefit of any protection, the damage in the American sector especially could have been catastrophic to the lines of supply and communication.&quot;

Mulberry B was substantially reinforced with units salvaged from the American harbor and that the Phoenixes were pumped full of sand to give them greater stability, measures that undoubtedly explain the extended service which the British port was able to render. Furthermore, the planners obviously underrated the capacities of open beaches. The tremendous tonnage capacities subsequently developed at both Utah and Omaha were without doubt one of the most significant and gratifying features of the entire Overlord operation.

==Surviving remnants in the UK==
Sections of Phoenix caissons are located at:
* Thorpe Bay, Southend-on-Sea – while being towed from Immingham to Southsea, the caisson began to leak and was intentionally beached on a sandbank in the Thames Estuary. It was designated as a scheduled monument in 2004. It is accessible at low tide.
* Pagham Harbour, West Sussex – south-east of Pagham a Phoenix Caisson, known as the &#x27;Near Mulberry&#x27;, that sank and could not be re-floated is still visible at low tide. Further off the coast in of water, is a second Phoenix Caisson, known as the &#x27;Far Mulberry&#x27;, that broke its back and sank in the storm the night before D-Day. Both sections were scheduled in 2019.
* Littlestone-on-Sea, Kent – caisson could not be refloated. The site was scheduled in 2013.
* Langstone Harbour, Hayling Island – faulty caisson left in-situ at place of construction.
* Littlehampton - caissons about five metres underwater and dived by novice divers.
* Portland Harbour, Portland, Dorset – two are located at the beach at Castletown. They were designated as a Grade II listed building in 1993.
Beetles are located at:
* Bognor Regis, on the shore line West of Marine Drive, Aldwick, where it washed up a few days after D-Day. Easily accessible at low tide
* Garlieston, Wigtownshire - concrete beetle remains are accessible on foot on the north side of Garlieston Bay (Eggerness) and at Cairn Head on the south side of Portyerrock Bay on the road to Isle of Whithorn.

* Old House Point, Cairnryan, Dumfries and Galloway, three beetles at the shore line.
Other artefacts around Garlieston include:
* a conspicuous stone wall at the back of Rigg Bay beach: this was the landward terminal for a &quot;Crocodile&quot; link to a &quot;Hippo&quot;
* the remains of a collapsed &quot;Hippo&quot; visible at low tide in Rigg Bay
* a number of abandoned brick buildings, once the camp at Cairn Head
* some lengths of concrete roadway on the beach at Cairn Head, intended for use with &quot;Swiss roll&quot;.
At Southampton, Town Quay, a short section of whale roadway and a buffer pontoon, now derelict, used after the war for Isle of Wight ferries, survive between the Royal Pier and the Town Quay car ferry terminal.

==German equivalent of Mulberry==
In the period between postponement and cancellation of Operation Sea Lion, the invasion of the United Kingdom, Germany developed some prototype prefabricated jetties with a similar purpose in mind. These could be seen in Alderney, until they were demolished in 1978.

==&quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; crosswords==

&quot;Mulberry&quot; and the names of all the beaches were words appearing in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; crossword puzzle in the month prior to the invasion. The crossword compilers, Melville Jones and Leonard Dawe, were questioned by MI5, which determined the appearance of the words was innocent. Over 60 years later, a former student reported that Dawe frequently requested words from his students, many of whom were children in the same area as US military personnel.

<text>Hugh Charles Troy, Jr. (1906–1964) was a US painter who is noted for his pranks.

Troy was a son of a Cornell University dairy professor of the same name, and both father and son were members of the Quill and Dagger society. Troy attended Cornell as an architecture student from 1922 to 1927, although he was suspended without receiving a degree due to a particular joke that offended the administration. Although many of his practical jokes on campus are legendary, university historians have been unable to prove their truthfulness and some suspect the majority of his tales to be exaggerated or entirely fabricated. After serving in the military in World War II (under Gen. Curtis LeMay), he made his living as an illustrator for books and magazines, authoring three children&#x27;s stories. He died in 1964.

==Notable practical jokes==
*Using a wastebasket made of a rhinoceros foot borrowed from Louis Agassiz Fuertes, Troy made what appeared to be rhinoceros tracks across campus and to the lake that was the source of drinking water for the area, Beebe Lake. This was done during a winter snowstorm. Troy also cut a large hole in the ice on the edge of the lake so it appeared that the animal had fallen in. Reportedly, many people stopped drinking the water until Troy revealed the prank with an anonymous letter.
*Troy took the galoshes of a Cornell lecturer and painted human feet on them. Then he covered his handiwork with a black paint that would wash off. When the lecturer used the galoshes in the rain, he looked like he was walking with bare feet.
*While working as the student sports reporter at Cornell, Troy invented a character named &quot;Johnny Tsal&quot;. Tsal was a poor wretch of a character who would inevitably finish last in whatever race that Troy was assigned to cover. &quot;Tsal&quot; was &quot;last&quot; spelled backwards. Troy said he invented this perpetual loser so that he would not have to feel bad about reporting someone&#x27;s defeat.
*In New York City, Troy would visit Central Park carrying a park bench he had bought. Police, suspecting he was trying to steal it, arrested him a number of times. He always presented the bill of sale and was released. Hugh got his revenge by coordinating with a number of friends to take the park benches all at the same time. Because the police thought it was &quot;that guy with the bill of sale&quot; again none of the bench thieves were stopped as they walked out of the park.
* Troy and friends once dressed up as workers and began digging in the middle of the street. Police arrived and began to divert traffic. Once they dug a large hole they left leaving confused policemen.
*Troy also dressed as workers and removed all of the light bulbs from the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel without being questioned.
*According to one story from Ithaca, New York, Troy and his friends saw a large sign that read &quot;JESUS SAVES&quot;. They decided to remove it from its original place beside a bridge and put it where it would do some good: on the front of a local bank. Legend has it that the bank did a record amount of business the next day.
*In 1935, at an exhibition of the works of Vincent van Gogh in New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art, Troy took a piece of corned beef, carved it into a shape of an ear and put it on display with a plaque that declared it was the ear that Van Gogh had cut off in 1888. People flocked to see it until museum authorities removed it.
*During World War II, Troy got fed up with military bureaucracy. He invented a new form for reports on the use of flypaper and sent it to command. The story goes that the Pentagon demanded that other units send theirs as well. Just when Hugh was sure that everyone was wasting time with these flypaper reports, he sent another letter to the Pentagon mentioning that counts might be inaccurate due to the counting of old flies from previous counts. To counter this, he suggested that each fly be daubed with a little ketchup using a toothpick. By doing so, previously counted flies would now have a marking for the next count. This task was then added to the roster.
*One of his jokes can still be seen. The giant globe in the lobby of the old Daily News Building in New York was painted by Troy. All the cities on it are national capitals, except one: Ithaca.

<doc id="357913" wikidata="Q44393" url="?curid=357913" title="Ludwig III of Bavaria">
<text>Ludwig III (Ludwig Luitpold Josef Maria Aloys Alfred; 7 January 1845 – 18 October 1921) was the last King of Bavaria, reigning from 1913 to 1918. Initially, he served in the Bavarian military as a lieutenant and went on to hold the rank of Oberleutnant during the Austro-Prussian War. He entered politics at the age of 18 becoming a member of the Bavarian parliament and was a keen participant in politics, supporting electoral reforms. Later in life, he served as regent and &quot;de facto&quot; head of state from 1912 to 1913, ruling for his cousin, Otto. After the Bavarian parliament passed a law allowing him to do so, Ludwig deposed Otto and assumed the throne for himself. He led Bavaria during World War I. His short reign was seen as championing conservative causes and he was influenced by the Catholic encyclical &quot;Rerum novarum&quot;. 

After the German Revolution of 1918–1919, the German Empire was dissolved and the Weimar Republic was created. As a result of this revolution, the Bavarian throne was abolished along with the other monarchies of the German states, ending the House of Wittelsbach&#x27;s 738-year reign over Bavaria. Fearing that he might be a victim of an assassination, Ludwig fled to Hungary, Liechtenstein and then Switzerland. He returned to Bavaria in 1920 and lived at Wildenwart Castle. Ludwig would die shortly after, when he was staying at Nádasdy Mansion in Sárvár.

==Early life==

Ludwig was born in Munich, the eldest son of Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria and of his wife, Archduchess Auguste Ferdinande of Austria (daughter of Leopold II, Grand Duke of Tuscany). He was a descendant of both Louis XIV of France and William the Conqueror. Hailing from Florence, Auguste always spoke in Italian to her four children. Ludwig was named after his grandfather, King Ludwig I of Bavaria.

Ludwig spent his first years living in the Electoral rooms of the Munich Residenz and in the Wittelsbacher Palace. From 1852 to 1863, he was tutored by Ferdinand von Malaisé. When he was ten years old, the family moved to the Leuchtenberg Palace.

In 1861 at the age of sixteen, Ludwig began his military career when his uncle, King Maximilian II of Bavaria, gave him a commission as a lieutenant in the 6th Jägerbattalion. A year later, he entered the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, where he studied law and economics. When he was eighteen, he automatically became a member of the Senate of the Bavarian Legislature as a prince of the royal house.

In 1866, Bavaria was allied with the Austrian Empire in the Austro-Prussian War. Ludwig held the rank of Oberleutnant. He was wounded at the Battle of Helmstadt, taking a bullet in his thigh. The incident contributed to the fact that he was rather averse to the military. He received the Knight&#x27;s Cross 1st Class of the Bavarian Military Merit Order.

==Marriage and children==

In June 1867, Ludwig visited Vienna to attend the funeral of his cousin, Archduchess Mathilda of Austria (daughter of his father&#x27;s sister Princess Hildegard of Bavaria). While there, Ludwig met Mathilde&#x27;s 18-year-old step-cousin Maria Theresia, Archduchess of Austria-Este, the only daughter of the late Archduke Ferdinand Karl Viktor of Austria-Este (1821–1849) and Archduchess Elisabeth Franziska of Austria (1831–1903), and they married on 20 February 1868 at St. Augustine&#x27;s Church in Vienna.

Until 1862, Ludwig&#x27;s uncle had reigned as King Otto I of Greece. Although Otto had been deposed, Ludwig was still in line of succession to the Greek throne. Had he ever succeeded, this would have required that he renounce his Roman Catholic faith and become Greek Orthodox. Maria Theresa&#x27;s uncle, Francis V, Duke of Modena, was a staunch Roman Catholic. He required that as part of the marriage agreement Ludwig renounce his rights to the throne of Greece, and so ensure that his children would be raised Roman Catholic. In addition, the 1843 Greek Constitution forbade the Greek sovereign to be simultaneously ruler of another country. Consequently, Ludwig&#x27;s younger brother Leopold technically succeeded upon their father&#x27;s death to the rights of the deposed Otto I, King of Greece.

By his marriage, Ludwig became a wealthy man. Maria Theresa had inherited large properties from her father. She owned the estate of Sárvár in Hungary and the estate of Eiwanowitz in Moravia (now Ivanovice na Hané in the Czech Republic). The income from these estates enabled Ludwig to purchase an estate at Leutstetten in Bavaria. Over the years, Ludwig expanded the Leutstetten estate until it became one of the largest and most profitable in Bavaria. Ludwig was sometimes derided as &quot;Millibauer&quot; (dairy farmer) due to his interest in agriculture and farming.

Although they maintained a residence in Munich at the Leuchtenberg Palace, Ludwig and Maria Theresa lived mostly at Leutstetten. They had a happy and devoted marriage which resulted in Thirteenth children:
* Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria (18 May 1869 – 2 August 1955), married Duchess Marie Gabriele in Bavaria on 10 August 1900. They had four children. He remarried Princess Antonia of Luxembourg on 7 April 1921. They had six children.

* Princess Dietlinde of Bavaria (2 January 1888 – 15 February 1889)

**** Countess Marie Gabrielle von und zu Arco-Zinneberg (born 1992)
**** Countess Giorgiana von und zu Arco-Zinneberg (born 1997)

On the death of her uncle Francis in 1875, Maria Theresa inherited his Jacobite claim to the thrones of England, Ireland and Scotland, and is called either &quot;Queen Mary IV and III&quot; or &quot;Queen Mary III&quot; by Jacobites.

==Service and politics==
Throughout his life, Ludwig took a great interest in agriculture. From 1868, he was the Honorary President of the Central Committee of the Bavarian Agricultural Society. In 1875, he bought Leutstetten Castle and made it a model farm. He was also very interested in technology, particularly water power. In 1891 at his initiation, the Bavarian Canal Society was established. In 1896 Prince Ludwig was appointed honorary member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences.

As a prince of the royal house he was automatically a member of the Senate of the Bavarian legislature; there he was a great supporter of the direct right to vote. Since 23 June 1863 already, Ludwig had been a member of the Chamber of the &quot;Reichsräte&quot;. In 1870 he voted as a member of the Bundesrat for the acceptance of the November treaties to join the North German Confederation. In 1871 he ran unsuccessfully for the first Reichstag elections as a candidate of the Bavarian Patriot Party. In 1906 he supported the Bavarian electoral reform, which the SPD founder August Bebel praised: &quot;The German people, if the Kaiser were to be chosen from one of the German princes, would presumably elect Wittelsbach Ludwig and not Prussia&#x27;s Wilhelm.&quot;

==Regent of Bavaria==
On 12 December 1912, Ludwig&#x27;s father Luitpold died. Luitpold had been an active participant in the deposition of his nephew, King Ludwig II, and had also acted as prince regent for his other nephew, King Otto. Although Otto had nominally been king since 1886, he had been under medical supervision since 1883 and it had long been understood that he would never be mentally capable of actively reigning. Ludwig III immediately succeeded his father as regent.

Almost immediately, certain elements in the press and other groups in society called for Ludwig to take the throne himself. The Bavarian Legislature was not, however, currently in session, and did not meet until 29 September 1913. On 4 November 1913, the legislature amended the constitution of Bavaria to include a clause specifying that if a regency for reasons of incapacity had lasted for ten years with no prospect of the king ever being able to reign, the regent could proclaim the end of the regency and assume the crown himself, with such action to be ratified by the legislature. The amendment received broad party support in the Lower Chamber where it was carried by a vote of 122 in favour, and 27 against. In the Senate there were only six votes against the amendment. The next day, 5 November 1913, Ludwig proclaimed the end of the regency, deposed his cousin and proclaimed his own reign as Ludwig III. The legislature duly ratified this action, and Ludwig took his oath on 8 November.

The constitutional amendment of 1913 brought a determining break in the continuity of the king&#x27;s rule in the opinion of historians, particularly as this change had been granted by the Landtag as a House of Representatives. Historians believe this marked a definitive step toward a modern constitutional monarchy with the king as a figurehead. Bavaria had already taken a step toward full parliamentary government a year earlier, when Georg von Hertling headed the first government that depended on a majority in the legislature.

==King of Bavaria==
Ludwig&#x27;s short reign was conservative and influenced by the Catholic encyclical &quot;Rerum novarum&quot;. Prime Minister Georg von Hertling, appointed by Luitpold in 1912, remained in office. Also as King Ludwig lived in the Wittelsbacher Palais rather than in the Munich Residenz.

At the outbreak of World War I in 1914 Ludwig sent an official dispatch to Berlin to express Bavaria&#x27;s solidarity. Later Ludwig even claimed annexations for Bavaria (Alsace and the city of Antwerp in Belgium, to receive an access to the sea). His hidden agenda was to maintain the balance of power between Prussia and Bavaria within the German Empire after a victory.

A spurious story holds that, a day or two after Germany&#x27;s declaration of war, Ludwig received a petition from a 25-year-old Austrian, asking for permission to join the Bavarian Army. The petition was promptly granted, and Adolf Hitler thereupon joined the Bavarian Army, eventually settling into the 16th Reserve Bavarian Infantry Regiment, where he served the remainder of the war. However, this account is based on Hitler&#x27;s recollections in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. Historian Ian Kershaw holds that Hitler&#x27;s story is simply not credible on its face, due to the remarkable bureaucratic effort it would have required to attend to this minor matter during days of extreme crisis. Kershaw suggests that bureaucratic error, rather than bureaucratic efficiency, was responsible for Hitler&#x27;s enlistment; indeed, as a national of an allied country, he should have been sent to Austria for service in that army. Based on Bavarian government investigations in 1924, the more likely scenario in Kershaw&#x27;s view is that Hitler applied for enlistment, along with thousands of other youths, on or about 5 August 1914, was initially turned away because the authorities were overwhelmed with applicants and had no place to assign him, and eventually was recalled to serve in the 2nd Infantry Regiment (2nd Battalion), before being assigned to Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16 (the List Regiment), which was principally made up of raw recruits.

In 1917, when Germany&#x27;s situation had gradually worsened due to World War I, Hertling became German Chancellor and Prime Minister of Prussia and Otto Ritter von Dandl was made &quot;Minister of State of the Royal Household and of the Exterior&quot; and &quot;President of the Council of Ministers&quot; on 11 November 1917, a title equivalent to Prime Minister of Bavaria. Accused of showing blind loyalty to Prussia, Ludwig became increasingly unpopular during the war. As the war drew to a close, the German Revolution broke out in Bavaria.

Already discussed since September 1917, on 2 November 1918, an extensive constitutional reform was established by an agreement between the royal government and all parliamentary groups, which, among other things, envisaged the introduction of proportional representation. Ludwig III, approved on the same day the transformation of the constitutional into a parliamentary monarchy. For the first time on 3 November 1918, initiated by the USPD, a thousand people gathered to protest on the Theresienwiese for peace and demanded the release of detained leaders. On 7 November 1918, Ludwig fled from the Residenz Palace in Munich with his family and took up residence in &quot;Schloss Anif&quot;, near Salzburg, for what he hoped would be a temporary stay. He was the first of the monarchs in the German Empire to be deposed. The next day, the People&#x27;s State of Bavaria was proclaimed.

On 12 November 1918, a day after the Armistice, Prime Minister Dandl went to Schloss Anif to see the king in hopes of persuading him to abdicate. Ludwig refused, instead giving Dandl the Anif declaration &quot;(Anifer Erklärung)&quot; in which he released all government officials, soldiers and civil officers from their oath of loyalty to him. He also stated that as a result of recent events, he was &quot;no longer in a position to lead the government.&quot; The declaration was published by the newly formed republican government of Kurt Eisner when Dandl returned to Munich the next day. Although the word &quot;abdication&quot; never appeared in the document, Eisner&#x27;s government interpreted it as such and added a statement that Ludwig and his family were welcome to return to Bavaria as private citizens as long as they did not act against the &quot;people&#x27;s state.&quot; This statement effectively dethroned the Wittelsbachs and ended the family&#x27;s 738-year rule over Bavaria.

==Final years==
Ludwig III returned to Bavaria. His wife, Maria Theresia, died 3 February 1919 at Wildenwart Castle/Chiemgau.

In February 1919, Eisner was assassinated; fearing that he might be the victim of a counter-assassination, Ludwig fled to Hungary, later moving on to Liechtenstein and Switzerland. He returned to Bavaria in April 1920 and lived at Wildenwart Castle again. There he remained until September 1921 when he took a trip to his castle Nádasdy in Sárvár in Hungary. He died there on 18 October.

On 5 November 1921, Ludwig&#x27;s body was returned to Munich together with that of his wife. In spite of fears a state funeral might spark a move to restore the monarchy, the pair were honored with one in front of the royal family, Bavarian government, military personnel, and an estimated 100,000 spectators. The burial took place in the crypt of the Munich Frauenkirche alongside their royal ancestors. Prince Rupprecht did not wish to use the occasion of the passing of his father to reestablish the monarchy by force, preferring to do so by legal means. Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber, Archbishop of Munich, in his funeral speech, made a clear commitment to the monarchy while Rupprecht only declared that he had stepped into his birthright.

<text>The Golden Ring of Russia () unites old Russian cities of five Oblasts – usually excluding Moscow – as a well-known theme-route. The grouping is centred northeast of the capital in what was the north-eastern part of ancient Rus&#x27;. The ring formerly comprised the region known as Zalesye. The idea of the route and the term was created in 1967 by Soviet historian and essayist Yuri Bychkov, who published in &quot;Sovetskaya Kultura&quot; in November–December 1967 a series of essays on the cities under the heading: &quot;Golden Ring&quot;. Bychkov was one of the founders of &quot;ВООПИК&quot;: the All-Russian Society for the Protection of Monuments of History and Culture (these letters in Romanized form are VOOPIK).

These ancient towns were heavily formative to the centrality of the Russian Orthodox Church in society. They preserve the memory of key events in medieval and Imperial Russian history. The towns have been called &quot;open-air museums&quot; and feature unique monuments of Russian architecture of the 12th–18th centuries, including kremlins, monasteries, cathedrals, and churches. These towns are among the most picturesque in Russia and prominently feature Russia&#x27;s onion domes.

The Golden Ring of Russia includes: Vladimir-Suzdal-Ivanovo-Kostroma-Yaroslavl-Rostov the Great-Pereslavl-Zalessky-Sergiev Posad

== Cities included ==


For years, tourists and locals debated about which cities were &quot;officially&quot; part of the Golden Ring. There is no official list of which cities make up part of the Golden Ring with the exception of the eight principal cities of Yaroslavl, Kostroma, Ivanovo, Suzdal, Vladimir, Sergiev Posad, Pereslavl-Zalessky and Rostov Veliky. In addition, other old cities in the Ivanovo, Vladimir and Yaroslavl regions also considered themselves as part of the ring, including Palekh, Plyos, and Shuya in Ivanovo Oblast; Gorokhovets, Gus-Khrustalny, Murom, and Yuriev-Polsky in Vladimir Oblast; and Rybinsk, Tutaev, and Uglich in Yaroslavl Oblast. Many cities are to be found along the M8 highway or can be reached from Yaroslavsky railway station in Moscow. Some of the churches, kremlins and monasteries are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. In Russia, the area of the Golden Ring is one of the regions that has strongly preserved many traditions and culture of ancient Russia to this day.
* Sergiyev Posad (Се́ргиев Поса́д) is the only city in the Moscow Region to be included in the Golden Ring. It is closely linked with the UNESCO-protected Troitse-Sergieva Lavra which was founded in the 14th century by St Sergius of Radonezh. The Lavra is now one of the most important religious sites in Russian and St Sergius is one of the most revered native Russian saints. 
* Pereslavl-Zalesskiy (Переславль-Залесский) is the birthplace of Aleksandr Nevsky – a celebrated Russian hero, prince and saint. It also has links with Peter the Great who used to have a toy flotilla here on Lake Plescheevo. In addition the city also boasts a beautiful 12th-century cathedral, earthen mounds and six monasteries, four of which are active. 
* Rostov Velikiy (Ростов) is known as Rostov-Veliky (Rostov the Great) to distinguish it from the larger and newer Rostov-on-Don. It is among the oldest of cities in Russia, having first been mentioned in chronicles in 862. Its most impressive sight is the white-stone kremlin which stands on Lake Nero and is now a museum-reserve. The city also has three monasteries and museums dedicated to the art of painting on enamel for which the city is famed. 
* Yaroslavl (Ярослáвль) is considered the unofficial capital of the Golden Ring and is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is believed to have been founded in 1010 by Prince Yaroslav the Wise, after whom it is named. The city’s main sight is the Spaso-Preobrazhensky Monastery which is now a museum and among its many beautiful churches the most famous are St Elijah the Prophet’s Church and the John the Baptist’s Church, both of which are beautifully decorated with frescos. Yaroslavl is just a 3-hour express train ride from Moscow.
* Kostroma (Кострома) Like Moscow, Kostroma is believed to have been founded by Grand Prince Yury Dolgoruky in the 12th century. The city is most famous for its Ipatievsky Monastery which has links with the Romanov Dynasty as the first Romanov tsar – Tsar Michael – was here being anointing to reign. Kostroma is the Golden Ring city furthest from Moscow and can be reached by a night train from the capital.
* Ivanovo (Иваново) is both the youngest and most industrialised of all Golden Ring cities. Previously the city was known as Ivanovo-Voznesensk after the two villages that were merged to form the new city in 1871. It is forever connected with its once-booming textile trade which led to the city being known as Bride City and Russian Manchester. Ivanovo is notable for its constructivist buildings, industrial architecture and monuments dedicated to the city&#x27;s rich revolutionary history.
* Gus-Khrustalny (Гусь-Хруста́льный)
* Suzdal (Суздаль) is often referred to as an open-air museum for the number of old buildings that have been preserved and the lack of industrialisation. Several sights are protected by UNESCO as the White Stone Monuments of Vladimir and Suzdal. Highlights include the Spaso-Yefimiev Monastery, which is now a museum, and the museums of the kremlin. In addition there are another four monasteries in the city. 
* Vladimir (Владимир), the former capital of medieval Russia, is historically important. It is somewhat more industrial than its neighbor, Suzdal, but St Demetrius’ Cathedral and the Dormition Cathedral, Vladimir&#x27;s Golden Gates, are UNESCO protected and masterpieces of ancient Russian architecture. 
* Rybinsk (Рыбинск)
* Uglich (Углич)
* Myshkin (Мышкин)
* Alexandrov (Александров)

== Branding ==

Now the main and most popular tourist route around provincial cities of central European Russia, the promotion of the Golden Ring was a new challenge after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. From a sustainability standpoint, there were new goals that needed to be achieved: the preservation of ancient architectural monuments, modernising the tourism industry within new capitalist system, building new types of infrastructures such as hotels, theme parks, museums and malls that encouraged economic growth. As the result cities of the Golden Ring were the first one that saw the outcome out of investments from new forms of entrepreneurship like privately owned businesses and startups.

<text>The Northrop F-20 Tigershark (initially F-5G) is a prototype light fighter, designed and built by Northrop. Its development began in 1975 as a further evolution of Northrop&#x27;s F-5E Tiger II, featuring a new engine that greatly improved overall performance, and a modern avionics suite including a powerful and flexible radar. Compared with the F-5E, the F-20 was much faster, gained beyond-visual-range air-to-air capability, and had a full suite of air-to-ground modes capable of utilizing most U.S. weapons. With these improved capabilities, the F-20 became competitive with contemporary fighter designs such as the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, but was much less expensive to purchase and operate.

Much of the F-20&#x27;s development was carried out under a US Department of Defense (DoD) project called &quot;FX&quot;. FX sought to develop fighters that would be capable in combat with the latest Soviet aircraft, but excluding sensitive front-line technologies used by the United States Air Force&#x27;s own aircraft. FX was a product of the Carter administration&#x27;s military export policies, which aimed to provide foreign nations with high quality equipment without the risk of US front-line technology falling into Soviet hands. Northrop had high hopes for the F-20 in the international market, but policy changes following Ronald Reagan&#x27;s election meant the F-20 had to compete for sales against aircraft like the F-16, the USAF&#x27;s latest fighter design. The development program was abandoned in 1986 after three prototypes had been built and a fourth partially completed.

==Development==

===F-5===
When John F. Kennedy entered office in 1961, the U.S. Department of Defense was instructed to find an inexpensive fighter aircraft that the United States could offer to its allies through the Mutual Defense Assistance Act. A number of designs were studied, including stripped-down versions of the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter and Vought F-8 Crusader, and the newly designed Northrop N-156F. On 23 April 1962, the United States Air Force (USAF) informed the United States Secretary of Defense that the N-156F had been selected, under the designation F-5 and given the name &quot;Freedom Fighter.&quot; 847 F-5s of various early marks would be produced.

As the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 became more common, the U.S. Air Force initiated the International Fighter Aircraft (IFA) program to provide an equivalent to allies. The USAF desired a light weight fighter with competitive performance to the MiG, inexpensive when purchased in large numbers, and with reasonable operating costs for prospective customer nations. Although numerous companies entered designs, Northrop&#x27;s existing F-5 put them in a leading position. They submitted an upgrade, the F-5E Tiger II, with the AN/APQ-153 radar and other changes to allow the AIM-9 Sidewinder missile to be fired from wing-tip rails. On 20 November 1970, Northrop&#x27;s entry was announced as the IFA winner. Northrop produced a total of 1,399 F-5E/F Tiger IIs by the time manufacturing ended in 1986.

===F-5G and export limitations===
In the late 1970s, the Taiwanese Republic of China Air Force started looking for a fighter aircraft to match improvements made in the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force. In particular, they wanted a platform capable of firing the AIM-7 Sparrow long-range missile. At the time, the US was in the process of opening up ties with the People&#x27;s Republic of China after President Nixon&#x27;s famous visit in 1972. China considered US support of Taiwan against their interests, and the US State Department wanted to tread carefully. They blocked export of all of the AIM-7 capable aircraft, even otherwise outdated early models of the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II. The State Department suggested the Israeli IAI Kfir instead; however, it was rejected. Taiwan was already producing the F-5E under license, so the Department of Defense asked Northrop to study adding an AIM-7 capable radar to the Tiger II as an alternative. This effort became the first of several F-5G studies.

In the spring of 1977, Jimmy Carter&#x27;s administration had announced a new military export policy that limited sales of front line designs to NATO, Australia, and Japan. Carter stated at the time that the U.S. could not be &quot;both the world&#x27;s champion of peace and the world&#x27;s leading supplier of the weapons of war.&quot; Previously, there was no coherent export policy, fueling concerns that the US&#x27;s latest technologies might quickly end up in Soviet hands.

Numerous exceptions were made; Israel and Egypt could buy advanced designs under the Camp David Agreements, Israel was even allowed to buy McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagles, a key component in U.S. air-defense technology. Iran was already receiving the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, and this demonstrated the problem with advanced exports in February 1979 when reports emerged that Iran had sold an AIM-54 Phoenix missile to the Soviets. South Korea&#x27;s F-16 order was initially blocked under this policy, but later allowed in the context of strengthening relations. Despite exceptions, the export policy was implemented, covering many potential and current customers. As the F-5G was a relatively modest upgrade to the F-5E, the F-5G appeared to be in a strong position for sales given the limitations placed on rival designs; nonetheless, President Carter personally blocked the sales of the F-5G to Taiwan.

===FX===
In 1979, problems with the export policy were becoming apparent. The Soviets continued to sell newer aircraft designs to their clients, placing allies of the U.S. at a disadvantage. Denied by the U.S., countries were turning to other vendors for modern fighters, notably France&#x27;s Dassault Mirage 2000. Barry N. Blechman, Assistant Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, testified that the US reductions in foreign arms transfers had actually encouraged other nations and increased worldwide arms sales. At the same time, there was considerable pressure to provide a suitable aircraft for Taiwan.

The State Department argued that the U.S. needed a modern counterpart for the role the F-5E had occupied in the 1960s and 1970s. In light of Carter&#x27;s concerns, they suggested that a new aircraft be designed for the role, based on technology that would not pose a threat to the U.S. After a lengthy study, in January 1980, President Carter allowed the development of a new export fighter: the FX. The FX would have to outperform the F-5E; however, it could not use any advanced avionics systems that were also used in U.S. aircraft. Unlike the Mutual Defense Assistance Act programs that led to the F-5E, FX would be entirely privately financed. Moreover, the companies could not market the aircraft directly; all sales would be handled by the Department of Defense.

Both Northrop and General Dynamics (GD) responded to the FX requirement. GD&#x27;s F-16/79 was a variant of the F-16A, replacing the Pratt &amp; Whitney F100 turbofan engine with the J79 turbojet and equipping it with downgraded avionics; Northrop responded with the F-5G.

===F-20===
When Ronald Reagan&#x27;s administration entered office in 1981, the export restrictions put in place by the Carter administration were slowly relaxed. At first, the FX program continued as normal, but a number of events eroded the value of the program and limited the F-5G&#x27;s potential sales. The signing of the 1982 US-PRC Joint Communiqué was a major agreement on arms sales, which continued blocking sales of the F-5G to Taiwan. By this point the Taiwanese had started their own light fighter project, the AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo. In signing the Communiqué, the U.S. was signaling that Taiwan would not receive modern aircraft; accordingly, the Ching-kuo became Taiwan&#x27;s primary focus. As a result, the F-5G&#x27;s sales potential remained unestablished.

In the summer of 1982, Deputy Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci sent a memorandum to the Air Force, encouraging it to seek out potential foreign customers to procure FX aircraft. However, four months later Carlucci sent a classified memo to the same services to abandon the FX, and green-lighting the exporting of front-line fighters overseas. In December, after prompting from the White House, Carlucci reversed his position again, and directed the Air Force to fund a small number of F-20s in the fiscal year 1984 budget.

The future of the FX program seemed doubtful. Following an agreement to sell F-16s to Pakistan, Northrop felt that the F-5G needed to match the performance of F-16. This would require not only better performance from the engine, but a new and comparable avionics suite as well. Northrop saw that the F-5G was still being viewed as the &quot;FX fighter&quot;, a low-cost option for second-tier air forces. To offset this impression, Northrop requested the designation &quot;F-20&quot;; the USAF approved in late 1982, and of the name &quot;Tigershark&quot; in March 1983.

==Design==
The primary design change between the earlier F-5E and the F-20 was the use of a single General Electric F404 engine, which was originally designed for the F/A-18 Hornet. The new engine provided 60% more thrust than the combined output of the F-5E&#x27;s two General Electric J85s. This improved the aircraft&#x27;s thrust-to-weight ratio from 1.0 to 1.13. The new engine gave a speed of over Mach 2.0, a ceiling over 55,000 ft (16,800 m), an initial climb rate of 52,800 ft per minute (16,100 m/min).

The wing profile remained the same as the F-5E, but had modified leading edge extensions (LEX), which improved the maximum lift coefficient of the wing by about 12% with an increase in wing area of only 1.6%. The original aircraft was fairly sluggish in pitch, so the horizontal stabilizer was increased in size by 30% and a new dual-channel fly-by-wire control system was added. Destabilizing the aircraft in pitch and modifying the LEX improved the instantaneous turn rate by 7% to 20°/sec. Sustained turn rate at Mach 0.8 and 15,000 ft (4,572 m) rose to 11.5°/sec, which compared well with the F-16&#x27;s 12.8°/sec. Supersonic turn rates were 47% higher than those of the F-5E.

The F-20 would also make greater usage of composite materials in its construction. During its development, several areas using metal were re-designed to use fiberglass, and there were numerous upgrades to various mechanical parts.

The F-20&#x27;s avionics suite was all-new and greatly improved over the earlier designs. The General Electric AN/APG-67 multi-mode radar was the heart of the sensor suite, offering a wide range of air-to-air and air-to-ground modes. The F-5&#x27;s electro-mechanical navigation system was replaced with an all-electronic version based on a ring laser gyroscope. Time from power-on to takeoff was greatly reduced as a result, to about 22 seconds, and Northrop boasted that the aircraft had the shortest scramble time of any contemporary aircraft. The cockpit of the F-5 was completely re-worked with a large head-up display (HUD) and two monochrome multi-function displays set high on the control panel, and the addition of a complete hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) control system. Many of the avionics promised to have reliability beyond that of any competing aircraft then in service.

The F-20 would have been able to use most of the common weapons in U.S.&#x27;s inventory, including the entire range of Mark 80 series bombs, the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missiles, and the AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missiles. Like the earlier F-5s, the test F-20s were equipped with two M39 cannon mounted in the nose. Production F-20s may have substituted two Ford Aerospace Tigerclaw cannons instead of the M39s; while the Tigerclaw was based on the M39, it was lighter and had a higher rate of fire than the M39A2.

The F-20 did, however, have several problems inherent to its small size. The low-mounted wing meant that there was limited ground clearance, and the position of the landing gear meant loads had to be positioned towards the outer ends of the wings. This limited hard point weights to 1,000 lb (454 kg). A single hard point under the fuselage could carry more, a single Mk 84 2,000 lbs bomb or up to five Mk 82 500 lbs bombs. Additionally, although the wing profiling improved lift at higher angles of attack (AoA) while maneuvering, it did not improve cruise lift performance at normal AoA. This did not present a problem in the fighter role, but did severely reduce its payload and range figures compared to similar aircraft like the F-16.

The F-20 was significantly more expensive than the previous generation F-5E. Among its Teen Series contemporaries, however, the F-20 was offered as a low-cost option; cost-wise it was estimated in 1983 that the unit fly-away cost of the F-20 (based on a 150-unit buy) was $10.7 million, compared to the F-16/79 at $11 million and the F-16A at $12.4 million. Unit life-cycle costs for the F-20 estimated as high as 40–50% lower than for the F-16. Another estimate of the F-20&#x27;s costs found it less expensive than other designs like the $30 million F-15 Eagle, or $15 million F-16 Fighting Falcon. The F-20 was projected to consume 53% less fuel, to require 52% less maintenance manpower, to have 63% lower operating and maintenance costs and to be four times more reliable than average front-line designs of the era. The F-20 also offered the ability to fire the beyond-visual-range AIM-7 Sparrow missile, a capability that the F-16 lacked at that time, and did not gain until the F-16A/B Block 15 ADF version in February 1989.

==Operational history==

===Testing===

On 30 August 1982, the original engine-change-only F-5G (serial 82-0062, c/n GG1001, registered N4416T) made its maiden flight piloted by Russ Scott. During the 40-minute flight, the prototype climbed to and reached Mach 1.04. GG1001 demonstrated outstanding reliability; by the end of April 1983 240 flights had been accumulated, including evaluation flights with 10 potential customer nations. The second prototype (serial number 82-0063, registered N3986B, c/n GI1001), featuring the complete avionics suite, made its first flight on 26 August 1983. The F-20 flew 1,500 flights prior to its termination; although these were exclusively flown in ideal conditions. According to the Rand Corporation, &quot;Northrop did not take a prototype approach with the F-20… The first F-20 was intended to be a production quality aircraft…&quot; 

During the test program, the F-20 fired the AIM-9 Sidewinder and, in February 1985 the AIM-7 Sparrow. In air-to-ground testing, it fired the AGM-65 Maverick, 2.75 in (70 mm) folding fin aerial rockets, dropped Mk. 82 bombs, and fired rounds from a 30 mm (1.18 in) gun pod (GPU-5/A, four-barrel GAU-13/A) in addition to the two internal 20 mm (.79 in) M39 cannon. One of the F-20&#x27;s flight characteristics was the ability to fly at only at 35° AoA (angle of attack), while the F-16 was limited to 30°; acceleration from Mach 0.9 to 1.2 in 29 seconds (at 9,150 m); climb to 12,200 m (or 40,000 ft) in 2.3 minutes (including 55 sec for the start and 22 for the INS set-up).
Northrop signed a Memorandum of Agreement with the Air Force in May 1983 that made the Air Force responsible for certifying the F-20&#x27;s performance, air worthiness and fixed-price program. Aerospace legend Chuck Yeager, employed as a spokesperson for Northrop, touted the aircraft as &quot;magnificent&quot; and was featured in advertising.

In November 1982, Bahrain became the first customer. South Korea also explored local production of the F-20, and in support improvements were implemented. These included avionics upgrades, an expanded fuel tank, and the use of fibreglass composites. The changes were so extensive that a fourth prototype was built to test them. By 1983, Northrop was involved in a number of simultaneous negotiations for the F-20, and its prospects appeared positive.

On 10 October 1984, GG1001 crashed in South Korea on a demonstration flight, killing Northrop pilot Darrell Cornell. An investigation cleared the F-20 of mechanical or design faults; it concluded Cornell had blacked out due to excessive g-forces. 
GI1001 crashed in May 1985 at Goose Bay, Labrador, killing Northrop pilot Dave Barnes. Again the crash was blamed on G-LOC; Barnes had been practicing his aerobatic routine for the Paris Air Show.

===Battle for sales===
In December 1981, President Reagan, reacting to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, signed a major economic and military aid package for Pakistan that included 40 F-16As. The offer was in keeping with U.S. policy towards the Soviet Union, and the idea of &quot;containment&quot; within a ring of U.S.-friendly countries. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was initially viewed as an attempt to break out of the arranged containment system, thus the U.S. placed a priority on quickly building up a new layer of defense. However, other U.S. allies saw this as a potential break in the FX policy, and began requesting only &quot;the very best.&quot;

Such approval was increasingly granted starting in 1982. In May, Venezuela, who had long examined the FX project, agreed to buy 18 F-16As and six F-16Bs, replacing a fleet of Mirage III interceptors and Mirage 5 ground-attack aircraft. Sweden decided to develop their own design, the JAS 39 Gripen. In September 1983, Turkey announced plans to buy 132 F-16Cs and 28 F-16Ds to replace their Lockheed F-104G/S Starfighter and Northrop F-5A/B. Greece, stung by its long-time rival receiving the F-16, purchased 34 F-16C and six F-16Ds in November 1984, giving a firm pledge of secrecy.

Then, late in 1983, the U.S. government made a financial commitment to help Israel develop its own new fighter, the IAI Lavi. Northrop objected to this, as the Lavi would be a potential competitor to the F-20 in the export market; while Northrop had to privately fund the F-20, the government was directly subsidizing a foreign competitor. Congressional support for Israel overruled Northrop&#x27;s complaints along with complaints from other branches of the government.

While other companies marketed directly to foreign air forces, the F-20 could only be marketed by the State Department as part of the FX program. Under this policy umbrella, Northrop had to submit every piece of marketing material to government review, which could take months. The State Department had no interest in selling the FX; from its perspective it was one aircraft among many, leading to a lackadaisical approach, and led to complaints from Northrop that the government was not promoting the F-20 enough.

===Congressional investigation===
Starting in March 1984, Congress chaired a series of hearings into FX. William Schneider, Jr., the Under Secretary of State for Security Assistance, Science and Technology, testified that FX policy might not result in any sales, in spite of any government support. He stated that the sales of arms such as FX was primarily a matter of foreign policy, secondarily a commercial venture. Thomas V. Jones, Northrop&#x27;s CEO, argued that there was little point independently developing aircraft if companies were reliant on the government to sell them. He suggested the FX policy be dropped, and F-20 allowed to be sold by the vendor. Additionally, Brigadier General Thomas Baker, USAF Director of International Programs, testified that the Air Force was not actively marketing FX. He observed that over four years the US had sold 100 fighters to 29 countries, none were FX. He also compared France&#x27;s aircraft exports, showing a market for a low-cost fighter existed. In the Committee&#x27;s concluding remarks, the State Department and DOD were accused of rhetoric, and lacking support, on FX.

In April 1984, after the Congressional hearings, the USAF was directed to promote FX actively. Several potential customers were briefed during May and June 1984 on the performance and cost of both the F-20 and F-16/79. The Air Force published an internal report on FX in late June 1984. The F-20 was characterized as having outstanding performance against viable threats; and seen as a candidate for the Air Force&#x27;s aggressor requirement. The report additionally stated that the F-20 had been contractor-funded, totaling over $750 million, compared to $60 million on the F-16/79. However, the report concluded that it had little or no market to sell to.

===Aggressor and Air National Guard roles===
A possibility for a U.S. purchase opened in 1984, for a small number of &quot;aggressor aircraft&quot; for dissimilar air combat training. In November 1984, Congress directed the Air Force and Navy to study the use of a single aircraft type to fill similar aggressor roles for both services. In January 1985 the Navy announced they had selected a specially configured version of the F-16. It was rumored that the aircraft was sold at a loss to keep Northrop&#x27;s F-20 out of the market.

Another chance for the F-20 was as an upgrade for the Air National Guard (ANG). Northrop claimed that the F-20&#x27;s fast scramble time made it a natural fit for this role, its lower cost would allow the ANG to operate larger aircraft numbers, and that it supported the AIM-7 while the F-16 did not. However, the Air Force&#x27;s requirements had priorities favoring the F-16 for the role; if the ANG flew the F-16, they would further lower unit costs, maintain commonality between the ANG and Regular Air Force, and better equip ANG units to perform front line combat roles. The Congressional Budget Office had also disputed Northrop&#x27;s lower cost claim in their own research. On 31 October 1986, the Air Force announced that the F-16C had been selected, which had been upgraded to support the AIM-7. As several nations had suggested they would accept the F-20 on the condition that it was inducted into the USAF, the selection was a heavy blow to Northrop.

===Cancellation===

After six years with no buyers, in late 1986 Northrop canceled the $1.2 billion project. Northrop was reluctant to protest perceived favoritism of the F-16 in fear of losing support for the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit stealth bomber project. Ongoing negotiations with the Royal Moroccan Air Force for 20 F-20s were canceled; along with the small order by Bahrain. Later on, a bribery scandal would emerge from the attempts to market the F-20 to South Korea, leading to several Northrop managers resigning and the reprimanding of chief executive Thomas V. Jones, who retired in 1989.

In the late 1980s, local production of the F-20 was discussed with India. A move was also made in the 1980s to market the aircraft to the Pakistan Air Force with a license production manufacture of the aircraft. It was evaluated by a Pakistani contingent in the United States, with the F-20 being flown by Abbas Mirza, a senior Pakistani Air Force fighter pilot. Of the components of the F-20, the radar would end up being the most successful; Taiwan selected it for the Ching-kuo, South Korea also adopted it for the KAI T-50 Golden Eagle trainer aircraft. As sales prospects were not apparent early on, GE sold their radar division, which was eventually acquired by Lockheed Martin.

Aviation author Steve Pace wrote of the F-20 as &quot;one of the best fighters that never went into production.&quot; While discussing military procurement, Thomas McNaugher stated that competition between the F-20 and the F-16 served to lower prices and generate &quot;massive savings&quot; for the U.S. government. Writing prior to cancellation, Ralph Nader and William Taylor noted that the F-20 had been commonly described as &quot;the first privately funded U.S. combat aircraft in recent history.&quot; Mazher A. Hameed commented in 1986 that the F-20 was a &quot;logical choice&quot; for the Gulf States and Saudi Arabia; however, it had &quot;scant chance of being selected&quot; due to political factors, as well as competition from other candidates such as the Mirage 2000 and Panavia Tornado ADV.

<text>The Eurasian crag martin or just crag martin (Ptyonoprogne rupestris) is a small passerine bird in the swallow family. It is about long with ash-brown upperparts and paler underparts, and a short, square tail that has distinctive white patches on most of its feathers. It breeds in the mountains of southern Europe, northwestern Africa and across the Palearctic. It can be confused with the three other species in its genus, but is larger with brighter tail spots and different plumage tone. Many European birds are resident, but some northern populations and most Asian breeders are migratory, wintering in northern Africa, the Middle East or India.

The Eurasian crag martin builds a nest adherent to the rock under a cliff overhang or increasingly onto a man-made structure. It makes a neat half-cup mud nest with an inner soft lining of feathers and dry grass. Nests are often solitary, although a few pairs may breed relatively close together at good locations. Two to five brown-blotched white eggs are incubated mainly by the female, and both parents feed the chicks. This species does not form large breeding colonies, but is gregarious outside the breeding season. It feeds on a wide variety of insects that it catches with its beak while flying near to cliff faces or over streams and alpine meadows. Adults and young may be hunted and eaten by birds of prey or corvids, and this species is a host of blood-sucking mites. With its large, expanding range and large population, there are no significant conservation concerns involving the species.

This bird is closely related to the other three crag martins which share its genus, and has sometimes been considered to be the same species as one or more of them, although it appears that there are areas where two species&#x27; ranges overlap without hybridisation occurring. All four &quot;Ptyonoprogne&quot; crag martins are quite similar in behaviour to other Old World swallows that build mud nests, and are sometimes subsumed into the larger genus &quot;Hirundo&quot;, but this approach leads to inconsistencies in classifying several other genera, particularly the house martins.

== Taxonomy ==

The Eurasian crag martin was formally described as &quot;Hirundo rupestris&quot; by Italian naturalist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli in 1769 and was moved to the new genus &quot;Ptyonoprogne&quot; by German ornithologist Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach in 1850. Its nearest relatives are the three other members of the genus, the pale crag martin, &quot;P. obsoleta&quot;, the rock martin, &quot;P. fuligula&quot;, and the dusky crag martin, &quot;P. concolor&quot;. The genus name is derived from the Greek &quot;ptuon&quot; (πτύον), &quot;a fan&quot;, referring to the shape of the opened tail, and Procne (Πρόκνη), a mythological girl who was turned into a swallow. The specific &quot;rupestris&quot; means &quot;of rocks&quot;, from the Latin &quot;rupes&quot; &quot;rock&quot;. There are no generally recognised subspecies. Two races, Central Asian &quot;P. r. centralasica&quot; and &quot;P. r. theresae&quot; in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco, have been proposed, but the slight differences in size and colour show no consistent geographical pattern. Fossils of this species have been found in Late Pleistocene deposits in Bulgaria, and in central France in layers dated at 242,000 to 301,000 years ago.

The four &quot;Ptyonoprogne&quot; species are members of the swallow family, and are placed in the subfamily Hirundininae, which comprises all swallows and martins except the very distinctive river martins. DNA studies suggest that there are three major groupings within the Hirundininae, broadly correlating with the type of nest built. The groups are the &quot;core martins&quot; including burrowing species like the sand martin, the &quot;nest-adopters&quot;, which are birds like the tree swallow that use natural cavities, and the &quot;mud nest builders&quot;. The &quot;Ptyonoprogne&quot; species construct an open mud nest and therefore belong to the last group; &quot;Hirundo&quot; species also build open nests, &quot;Delichon&quot; house martins have a closed nest, and the &quot;Cecropis&quot; and &quot;Petrochelidon&quot; swallows have retort-like closed nests with an entrance tunnel.

&quot;Ptyonoprogne&quot; is closely related to the larger swallow genus &quot;Hirundo&quot; into which it is often subsumed, but a DNA analysis showed that an enlarged genus &quot;Hirundo&quot; should logically contain all the mud-builder genera, including the &quot;Delichon&quot; house martins, a practice which few authorities follow. Although the nests of the &quot;Ptyonoprogne&quot; crag martins resemble those of typical &quot;Hirundo&quot; species like the barn swallow, the research showed that if &quot;Delichon&quot;, &quot;Cecropis&quot; and &quot;Petrochelidon&quot; are split from &quot;Hirundo&quot;, &quot;Ptyonoprogne&quot; should also be treated as a separate genus.

== Description ==
The Eurasian crag martin is long, with a wingspan, and weighs an average . It has ash-brown upperparts and paler underparts, and has a broader body, wings and tail than any other European swallow. The tail is short and square, with white patches near the tips of all but the central and outermost pairs of feathers. The underwing and undertail coverts are blackish, the eyes are brown, the small bill is mainly black, and the legs are brownish-pink. The sexes are alike, but juveniles have buff-brown tips to the plumage of the head, upperparts and wing coverts. This species can be distinguished from the sand martin by its larger size, the white patches on the tail, and its lack of a brown breast band. Where the range overlaps with that of another &quot;Ptyonoprogne&quot; species, the Eurasian crag martin is darker, browner and 15% larger than the rock martin, and larger and paler, particularly on its underparts than the dusky crag martin. The white tail spots of the Eurasian crag martin are significantly larger than those of both its relatives.

The crag martin&#x27;s flight appears relatively slow for a swallow. Rapid wing beats are interspersed with flat-winged glides, and its long flexible primaries give it the agility to manoeuvre near cliff faces. The average migration flight speed has been measured at 9.9 m/s (32.5 ft/s), less than the roughly 11 m/s (36 ft/s) typical for hirundines, but the data is limited. The bird often flies high, and shows the white spots as it spreads its tail. The vocalisations include short high &quot;pli&quot;, and &quot;piieh&quot; and &quot;tshir&quot; calls resembling those of the linnet and the house martin, respectively.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The Eurasian crag martin breeds in mountains from Iberia and northwesternmost Africa through southern Europe, the Persian Gulf and the Himalayas to southwestern and northeastern China. Northern populations are migratory, with European birds wintering in north Africa, Senegal, Ethiopia and the Nile Valley, and Asian breeders going to southern China, the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East. Some European birds stay north of the Mediterranean, and, like martins in warmer areas such as India, Turkey and Cyprus, just move to lower ground after breeding. The breeding range is bounded by the July isotherm, and wintering areas need a temperature of about for enough insect food to be available. This is a rare species any distance north of its breeding areas. For example, there are only 12 records from the UK, none from Ireland, and the first record for Sweden was reported as recently as 1996. South of its normal wintering range, it has occurred as a vagrant in The Gambia. In 2022, the first nesting of the species was recorded on the territory of Slovakia in the Malá Fatra National Park.

Crag martins breed on dry, warm and sheltered cliffs in mountainous areas with crags and gorges. The typical altitude is but breeding occurs up to in Central Asia. The Eurasian crag martin&#x27;s choice of nest sites is very similar to that of Savi&#x27;s pipistrelle, &quot;Hypsugo savii&quot;; the bird and the bat often breed in the same locations and have almost identical ranges in Europe. In South Asia, migrant Eurasian birds sometimes join with flocks of the dusky crag martin and roost communally on ledges of cliffs or buildings.

The largest known wintering roost of Eurasian crag martins has been recorded at the Gorham&#x27;s Cave Complex in Gibraltar. The caves were home to a maximum of 12,000 birds during the 2020-2021 winter season; 1-2% of the entire European population of Eurasian crag martins.

== Behaviour ==

=== Breeding ===

Crag martin pairs nest alone or in small colonies, usually containing fewer than ten nests. Nests are on average apart and each pair aggressively defends its breeding territory against other crag martins and most other bird species. Nesting takes place from May to August, and usually two broods are raised. The nest, built by both adults, is an open half cup made of mud and lined with soft material such as feathers or dry grass. It is constructed under an overhang on a rock cliff face, in a crevice or cave, or on a man-made structure. It takes one to three weeks to build and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years. The clutch is two to five eggs with an average of three. The eggs are white with brownish blotches particularly at the wide end, and average with a weight of . The eggs are incubated mainly by the female for 13–17 days to hatching, and the chicks take another 24–27 days to fledge. Both parents feed the chicks bringing food every two to five minutes, and the young are fed for 14–21 days after fledging. With such frequent feeding rates the adults mainly forage in the best hunting zones in the immediate vicinity of the nest, since the further they fly to forage the longer it would take to bring food to the chicks in the nest. In an Italian study, the hatching rate was 80.2 percent, and the average number of fledged young was 3.1.

The crag martin has over the last few decades increasingly used houses and other man-made sites to nest. This greater availability of breeding sites has enabled the species to expand its range, but it is possible that this will lead to competition with other hirundines, such as the barn swallow and common house martin, which also use artificial nest sites.

An Italian study showed that, as with other aerial feeders, the start of breeding was delayed by cold or wet weather, but this had no influence on the clutch size nor on the number of fledged young. Unexpectedly, it was found that once the eggs had hatched there was a negative relationship between temperature and the number of fledged young. The authors suggested that hot weather dried up the small rivers where the parents found food. Colony size did not influence the laying date, the clutch size or the number of successfully fledged young, but this species does not form large colonies anyway.

=== Feeding ===
The Eurasian crag martin feeds mainly on insects caught in its beak in flight, although it will occasionally take prey items off rocks, the ground, or a water surface. When breeding, birds often fly back and forth near to a rock face hunting for insects, feeding both inside and outside the nesting territory. At other times, they may hunt while flying above streams or alpine meadows. The insects taken depend on what is locally available and may include flies, ants, aerial spiders, and beetles. Aquatic species such as stoneflies, caddisflies and pond skaters appear to be important in at least Spain and Italy. Unlike other hirundines, these birds feed close to their breeding sites, and may be locally vulnerable to fluctuations in insect availability. This martin is gregarious outside the breeding season, and may form sizeable flocks where food is abundant. Cliff faces generate standing waves in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas. The crag martin exploits the area close to the cliff when it hunts, relying on its high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns.

===Winter roost fidelity===
Eurasian crag martins are known to form large roosts in winter, with the largest known roost being the Gorham&#x27;s Cave Complex in Gibraltar. A study carried out at these caves and published in Scientific Reports in 2021, revealed that birds showed very high fidelity towards individual caves within and between years. Mark-recapture showed there was over a 90% chance of recapturing birds at the caves where they were first caught. The condition of birds from different caves suggests differences in roost quality which correlates to the fitness of Eurasian crag martins and, ultimately, survivorship.

== Predators and parasites ==
This species is occasionally hunted by the peregrine falcon, which shares its mountain habitat, and during its migration over the Himalayas, it is reported to be subject to predation by crows. Common kestrels, Eurasian sparrowhawks, Eurasian jays and common ravens are also treated as predators and attacked by repeated dives if they approach nesting cliffs. Despite the general aggressiveness of the crag martin, it tolerates sympatric common house martins, perhaps because the large numbers of that highly colonial species provide an early warning of predators.

The crag martin is a host of blood-sucking mites of the genus &quot;Dermanyssus&quot;, including &quot;D. chelidonis&quot;, and of the nasal mite &quot;Ptilonyssus ptyonoprognes&quot;. Two new species of parasites were first discovered on this martin, the fly &quot;Ornithomya rupes&quot; in Gibraltar and the flea &quot;Ceratophyllus nanshanensis&quot; from China.

== Status ==

The European population of the Eurasian crag martin is estimated to be 360,000–1,110,000 individuals, including 120,000–370,000 breeding pairs. A rough estimate of the worldwide population is 500,000–5,000,000 individuals, with Europe hosting between one-quarter and one-half of the total. The population is estimated to be increasing following a northward expansion, which may be partly due to increased use of man-made structures as nest sites. Expansions of the range have been reported in Austria (where motorway bridges are used as nest sites), Switzerland, the former Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria. With its very large range and high numbers, the Eurasian crag martin is not considered to be threatened, and it is classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List.

<doc id="357932" wikidata="Q16834555" url="?curid=357932" title="Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp.">
<text>Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 539 U.S. 23 (2003), was a copyright and trademark case of the Supreme Court of the United States involving the applicability of the Lanham Act to a work in the public domain.

==Background==
In 1948, Fox obtained the exclusive rights to create a television series, &quot;Crusade in Europe&quot;, based on a 1948 book &quot;Crusade in Europe&quot;, written by Dwight Eisenhower and published by Doubleday. The 26-episode series showed World War II film footage from the US military and other sources, with a voice soundtrack based on a narration of the book. In 1975, Doubleday renewed the copyright on the book. Fox, however, did not renew the copyright on the TV series and so the show entered the public domain in 1977.

In 1988, Fox reacquired the television rights to the book and licensed it to other companies the right to distribute &quot;Crusade in Europe&quot; on video. In 1995, Dastar purchased Betacam videotapes of the original TV series, copied the tapes, edited them to about half the original length, created new packaging, and sold the TV series as &quot;World War II Campaigns in Europe&quot;. The new videotapes and advertising mentioned Dastar and its employees as the producer but did not mention the original &quot;Crusade in Europe&quot; book, TV series, or producers.

Fox sued in 1998 by claiming that Dastar had infringed the copyright to the &quot;Crusade in Europe&quot; book and that under the Lanham Act, it had illegally done a &quot;reverse passing off&quot; by passing off the work of others as its own work. The district court found for Fox and awarded it double the profits that Dastar had made. The Court of Appeals reversed the copyright claim and sent it back to the district court on remand, but it upheld the &quot;reverse passing off&quot; Lanham Act ruling and affirmed the award of double the profits.

==Decision==
The U.S. Supreme Court, ruling only on the &quot;reverse passing off&quot; claim, reversed the decisions of the appeals court and district court, ruling 8–0 in favor of Dastar. The Court reasoned that although the Lanham Act forbids a reverse passing off, the rule regarding the misuse of trademarks is trumped by the fact that once a copyrighted work (or even a patented invention) enters into the public domain, anyone in the public may do anything with the work, with or without attribution to the author.

Justice Antonin Scalia, writing in the decision, noted that the Court in the past has held that the Lanham Act &quot;does not exist to reward manufacturers for their innovation in creating a particular device; that is the purpose of the patent law and its period of exclusivity.&quot; Therefore, claims about authorship cannot be used as an end-run around the underlying philosophy of a time limit on exclusive ownership of a copyright or patent. Allowing such restrictions on a public domain work would serve, Scalia wrote, &quot;to create a species of mutant copyright law that limits the public&#x27;s &#x27;federal right to &quot;copy and to use&quot;&#x27; expired copyrights,&quot; and that would effectively create &quot;a species of perpetual patent and copyright, which Congress may not do,&quot; according to Article I of the US Constitution.

Scalia noted that if Dastar had instead purchased the post-1988 videotapes and copied them, that would have been a clear copyright infringement.

==Analysis==
In reconciling this case with the earlier &quot;Eldred v. Ashcroft&quot;, Kurt M. Saunders considered &quot;Dastar&quot; a reassurance from the Supreme Court that, although &quot;Eldred&quot; said Congress was free to extend copyright durations, a work outside of copyright was free to use.

==Subsequent history==
On remand, the district court, after the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling, dismissed Twentieth Century Fox&#x27;s Lanham Act claims as well as analogous California state law unfair competition claims. The only remaining issue was whether the plaintiffs had a copyright in the underlying work, Eisenhower&#x27;s book &quot;Crusade in Europe&quot;. The district court held a bench trial and determined that the plaintiffs owned a valid copyright in the book and that Dastar had infringed that copyright by including portions of the book&#x27;s narrative in its film version. Dastar appealed, but the Ninth Circuit affirmed.

<doc id="357953" wikidata="Q27624595" url="?curid=357953" title="European red-rumped swallow">
<text>The European red-rumped swallow (Cecropis rufula) is a small passerine bird in the swallow family Hirundinidae. It breeds in open hilly country of southern Europe and north Africa east to Iran, Pakistan and northwest India. During winter it migrates to Africa and southwest Asia. It was formerly considered to be a subspecies of the eastern red-rumped swallow (&quot;Cecropis daurica&quot;), united under the common name of “red-rumped swallow”.

European red-rumped swallows are somewhat similar in habits and appearance to the other aerial insectivores, such as the related swallows and the unrelated swifts (order Apodiformes). They have blue upperparts and dusky underparts.

They resemble barn swallows, but are darker below and have pale or reddish rumps, face and neck collar. They lack a breast band, but have black undertails. They are fast fliers and they swoop on insects while airborne. They have broad but pointed wings.

European red-rumped swallows build quarter-sphere nests with a tunnel entrance lined with mud collected in their beaks, and lay 3 to 6 eggs. They normally nest under cliff overhangs in their mountain homes, but will readily adapt to buildings such as mosques and bridges.

They do not normally form large breeding colonies, but are gregarious outside the breeding season. Many hundreds can be seen at a time on the plains of India.

==Taxonomy==
The European red-rumped swallow was formally described in 1835 by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck under the binomial name &quot;Hirundo rufula&quot;. The specific epithet is from Latin &quot;rufulus&quot; meaning &quot;reddish&quot;. The species was formerly treated as a subspecies of the red-rumped swallow (&quot;Cecropis daurica&quot;) now renamed the eastern red-rumped swallow. The species were split based on differences in morphology and genetic divergence. The European red-rumped swallow is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Distribution and habitat==

The European red-rumped swallow breeds across southern Europe and southern Europe and north Africa east to Iran, Pakistan and northwest India. During winter it migrates to Africa and southwest Asia.

==Behaviour and ecology==
These swallows are usually found over grassland where they hawk insects. They may sometimes take advantage of grass fires and grazing cattle that flush insects into the air.

===Breeding===
It is thought that the sequence &quot;open-nest&quot; to &quot;closed nest&quot; to &quot;retort nest&quot; represents the evolutionary development in the mud-building swallows, and individual species follow this order of construction. A retort builder like red-rumped swallow starts with an open cup, closes it, and then builds the entrance tunnel. It has been proposed that the development of closed nests reduced competition between males for copulations with the females. Since mating occurs inside the nest, the difficulty of access means other males are excluded. This reduction in competition permits the dense breeding colonies typical of the &quot;Delichon&quot; and &quot;Petrochelidon&quot; genera, but colonial breeding is not inevitable; most &quot;Cecropis&quot; species are solitary nesters.

== Conservation status ==

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) is the organisation responsible for assessing the conservation status of species. A species is assessed as subject to varying levels of threat if it has a small, fragmented or declining range, or if the total population is less than 10,000 mature individuals, or numbers have dropped by more than 10% in ten years or with a continuing decline over generations. The red-rumped swallow has a huge range and a population numbered in millions. It is not known to be seriously declining in range or numbers, so it is classed as Least Concern.

The European red-rumped swallow is extending its range northward in Europe, colonising France and Romania in recent decades. The European population is estimated at 100,000 to 430,000 breeding pairs or 300,000 to 1,290,000 individuals.

<text>Eumetazoa (), also known as diploblasts, Epitheliozoa or Histozoa, are a proposed basal animal clade as a sister group of Porifera (sponges). The basal eumetazoan clades are the Ctenophora and the ParaHoxozoa. Placozoa is now also seen as a eumetazoan in the ParaHoxozoa. The competing hypothesis is the Myriazoa clade.

Several other extinct or obscure life forms, such as &quot;Iotuba&quot; and &quot;Thectardis&quot;, appear to have emerged in the group. Characteristics of eumetazoans include true tissues organized into germ layers, the presence of neurons and muscles, and an embryo that goes through a gastrula stage.

Some phylogenists once speculated the sponges and eumetazoans evolved separately from different single-celled organisms, which would have meant that the animal kingdom does not form a clade (a complete grouping of all organisms descended from a common ancestor). However, genetic studies and some morphological characteristics, like the common presence of choanocytes, now unanimously support a common origin.

Traditionally, eumetazoans are a major group of animals in the Five Kingdoms classification of Lynn Margulis and K. V. Schwartz, comprising the Radiata and Bilateria – all animals except the sponges. When treated as a formal taxon Eumetazoa is typically ranked as a subkingdom. The name Metazoa has also been used to refer to this group, but more often refers to the Animalia as a whole. Many classification schemes do not include a subkingdom Eumetazoa.

==Taxonomy==
A widely accepted hypothesis, based on molecular data (mostly 18S rRNA sequences), divides Bilateria into four superphyla: Deuterostomia, Ecdysozoa, Lophotrochozoa, and Platyzoa (sometimes included in Lophotrochozoa). The last three groups are also collectively known as Protostomia.

However, some skeptics emphasize inconsistencies in the new data. The zoologist Claus Nielsen argues in his 2001 book &quot;Animal Evolution: Interrelationships of the Living Phyla&quot; for the traditional divisions of Protostomia and Deuterostomia.

==Evolutionary origins==
It has been suggested that one type of molecular clock and one approach to interpretation of the fossil record both place the evolutionary origins of eumetazoa in the Ediacaran. However, the earliest eumetazoans may not have left a clear impact on the fossil record and other interpretations of molecular clocks suggest the possibility of an earlier origin. The discoverers of &quot;Vernanimalcula&quot; describe it as the fossil of a bilateral triploblastic animal that appeared at the end of the Marinoan glaciation prior to the Ediacaran period, implying an even earlier origin for eumetazoans.

<text>James Harrison Wilson Thompson (March 21, 1906 – disappeared March 26, 1967; declared dead 1974) was an American businessman who helped revitalize the Thai silk industry in the 1950s and 1960s. At the time of his disappearance he was one of the most famous Americans living in Asia. &quot;Time&quot; magazine claimed he &quot;almost singlehanded(ly) saved Thailand&#x27;s vital silk industry from extinction&quot;.

==Early life==
Jim Thompson was born in Greenville, Delaware in 1906. He was the youngest of five children of Henry and Mary Wilson Thompson. His father was a wealthy textile manufacturer; his mother was the daughter of James Harrison Wilson (1837–1925), a noted Union general during the American Civil War.

Thompson spent his early years of education at St. Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, New Hampshire. He graduated from Princeton University in 1928, and represented the United States in the 6-Metre Sailing event at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Post-graduate studies followed at the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s School of Architecture, but he did not complete his degree at this institution due to his weakness in calculus.

From 1931 to 1940, he practiced in New York City with Holden, McLaughlin &amp; Associates, designing homes for the East Coast rich. During this period, he led an active social life and sat on the board of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo.

In 1941, he quit his job and enlisted with the Delaware National Guard. Before the outbreak of the Second World War, he was transferred to a military outpost in Fort Monroe, Virginia. While he was there, he got to know Second Lieutenant Edwin Fahey Black, a fresh graduate from the US Military Academy, West Point. It was Black who encouraged him to join the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency.

==World War II activities==
At the height of the Second World War, Thompson was recruited by Major General William Joseph Donovan (1883–1959) to serve as an operative in the OSS.

His first assignment was with the French Resistance in North Africa. He was then sent to Europe. After Victory in Europe Day (May 7–8, 1945), he was transferred to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) to work with the pro-Allied Free Thai Movement (&quot;Seri Thai&quot;). Their mission was to help liberate Thailand from the occupying Japanese Army. The group had the support of Pridi Panomyong, the regent to King Ananda Mahidol of Thailand, and Seni Pramoj, the Thai ambassador to the United States.

In August 1945, Thompson was about to be sent into Thailand, when the surrender of Japan officially ended World War II. He arrived in Thailand shortly after Victory over Japan Day and organized the Bangkok OSS office. While there he got to know Constance (Connie) Mangskau, an Allied Services translator, who later became one of his closest friends.

In the spring of 1946, Thompson went to work as a military attaché at the United States legation for his former Princeton classmate Charles Woodruff Yost, the US Minister to Thailand. It was the start of Thompson&#x27;s eleven year affair with Yost&#x27;s wife, Irena. In 1950, she had a child, but neither Thompson nor Yost could establish paternity prior to DNA testing.

Thompson used his contacts with the Free Thai and Free Laos (&quot;Lao Issara&quot;) groups to gather information and defuse conflicts on Thailand&#x27;s borders. Working with him in the legation was Kenneth Landon, an American missionary whose wife, Margaret Landon, was the author of &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot;, which was the inspiration for the 1946 film of the same name, and the 1956 film &quot;The King and I&quot;.

==Return to private industry==
In late 1946, Thompson headed for home to seek his discharge from the army. After his divorce from Patricia Thraves (1920–1969), he returned to Thailand to join a group of investors to buy the Oriental Hotel in Bangkok. While working on its restoration, he had some differences with his associates and this resulted in him giving up his shares in the company. He subsequently switched his focus to silk trade.

In 1948, he partnered with George Barrie to found the Thai Silk Company Limited. It was capitalized at $25,000. They each owned 18% of the shares, and the remaining 64% were sold to Thai and foreign investors.

The firm achieved a coup in 1951 when designer Irene Sharaff made use of Thai silk fabrics for the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, &quot;The King and I&quot;. From then on, the company prospered.

Besides inventing the bright jewel tones and dramatic color combinations today associated with Thai silk, Thompson raised thousands of Thailand&#x27;s poorest people out of poverty. His determination to keep his company cottage-based was significant for the women who made up the bulk of his work force. By allowing them to work at home, they retained their position in the household while becoming breadwinners. It was only after Thompson&#x27;s disappearance that the Thai Silk Company relocated its weaving operations to Korat, a city which serves as a base of operations for the Royal Thai Army. Although it abandoned home-based weaving in favor of factories in the early 1970s, the Thai Silk Company&#x27;s facility in Amphoe Pak Thong Chai, Korat, presents itself more as a beautifully landscaped campus than a typical factory.

==Thompson&#x27;s &quot;House on the Klong&quot;==


Thompson was unlike any other figure in Southeast Asia. He was an American, an ex-architect, a retired army officer, a one-time spy, a silk merchant and a collector of antiques. Most of Thompson&#x27;s treasures, if not all, were amassed after he came to Thailand.

In 1958, Thompson began what was to be the pinnacle of his architectural achievement – the construction of a new home to showcase his &quot;objets d&#x27;art&quot;.

Using parts of old up-country houses – some as old as a hundred years – Thompson succeeded in constructing a masterpiece that involved the reassembling of six Thai dwellings on his estate. Most of the units were dismantled and brought over by river from Ayutthaya, but the largest – a weaver&#x27;s house (now the living room) – came from Bangkrua. On arrival, the woodwork was offloaded and pieced together.

In his quest for authenticity, Thompson saw to it that some of the structures were elevated a full floor above the ground. During the construction stage, he added his own touches to the buildings by positioning, for instance, a central staircase indoors rather than having it outside. Along the way, Thompson also reversed the wall panels of his quarters so that it now faced inside instead of it having an external orientation.

After Thompson was through with its creation, he filled his home with the items he had collected in the past. Decorating his rooms were Chinese blue-and-white Ming pieces, Belgian glass, Cambodian carvings, Victorian-era chandeliers, Benjarong earthenware, Thai stone images, Burmese statues, and a dining table which was once used by King Rama V of Thailand.

Thompson dedicated nearly a year to the meticulous creation of his opulent mansion. Today, transformed into a museum, the Jim Thompson House is conveniently accessible via public or private transportation. Known for its architecture and historical significance, the site is popular for tourists, featuring in the top 5 must-visit places in Bangkok according to TripAdvisor&#x27;s 2022 rankings.

==Disappearance==
Thompson disappeared from Malaysia&#x27;s Cameron Highlands after going for a walk on March 26, 1967. His disappearance from the hill station generated one of the largest land searches in Southeast Asian history and remains one of the most famous mysteries in the region. Over the years, many theories have been advanced to explain his disappearance, but no definitive answer has ever emerged. Thompson was declared dead in absentia by a Thai court in 1974.

<text>The harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) is a large neotropical species of eagle. It is also called the American harpy eagle to distinguish it from the Papuan eagle, which is sometimes known as the New Guinea harpy eagle or Papuan harpy eagle. It is the largest bird of prey throughout its range, and among the largest extant species of eagles in the world. It usually inhabits tropical lowland rainforests in the upper (emergent) canopy layer. Destruction of its natural habitat has caused it to vanish from many parts of its former range, and it is nearly extirpated from much of Central America. The genus &quot;Harpia&quot;, together with &quot;Harpyopsis&quot;, &quot;Macheiramphus&quot; and &quot;Morphnus&quot;, form the subfamily Harpiinae.

==Taxonomy==
The harpy eagle was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as &quot;Vultur harpyja&quot;, after the mythological beast harpy. It is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Harpia&quot; that was introduced in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot. The harpy eagle is most closely related to the crested eagle (&quot;Morphnus guianensis&quot;), the Papuan eagle (&quot;Harpyopsis novaeguineae&quot;) and the bat hawk (&quot;Macheiramphus alcinus&quot;), the four composing the subfamily Harpiinae within the large family Accipitridae. Previously thought to be closely related, the Philippine eagle has been shown by DNA analysis to belong elsewhere in the raptor family, as it is related to the Circaetinae.

The specific name &quot;harpyja&quot; and the word &quot;harpy&quot; in the common name both come from Ancient Greek &quot;harpyia&quot; (). They refer to the harpies of Ancient Greek mythology. These were wind spirits who flew the dead to Hades or Tartarus, purported to have the lower body and talons of a raptor and the head of a woman, standing anywhere from the height of a tall child to as high as a grown man; some depictions have the creatures possessing an eagle-like body with the exposed breasts of an elderly female human, a giant wingspan and the head of a grotesque, sharp-toothed, mutant eagle—something more akin to a goblin with wings.

==Description==
The upperside of the harpy eagle is covered with slate-black feathers, and the underside is mostly white, except for the feathered tarsi, which are striped black. A broad black band across the upper breast separates the gray head from the white belly. The head is pale grey, and is crowned with a double crest. The upperside of the tail is black with three gray bands, while the underside of it is black with three white bands. The irises are gray or brown or red, the cere and bill are black or blackish and the tarsi and toes are yellow. The plumage of males and females is identical. The tarsus is up to long.

Female harpy eagles typically weigh . One source states that adult females can weigh up to . An exceptionally large captive female, &quot;Jezebel&quot;, weighed . Being captive, however, this large female may not be representative of the weight possible in wild harpy eagles due to differences in the food availability. The male, in comparison, is much smaller and may range in weight from . The average weight of adult males has been reported as against an average of for adult females, a 35% or higher difference in mean body mass. Harpy eagles may measure from in total length and have a wingspan of . Among the standard measurements, the wing chord measures , the tail measures , the tarsus is long, and the exposed culmen from the cere (the beak) is . Mean talon size is in males, and in females.

It is sometimes cited as the largest eagle alongside the Philippine eagle, which is somewhat longer on average (between sexes averaging ) but weighs slightly less, and the Steller&#x27;s sea eagle, which is perhaps slightly heavier on average (mean of three unsexed birds was ). 

The harpy eagle may be the largest bird species to reside in Central America, though large water birds such as American white pelicans (&quot;Pelecanus erythrorhynchos&quot;) and jabirus (&quot;Jabiru mycteria&quot;) have scarcely lower mean body masses. The wingspan of the harpy eagle is relatively small, though the wings are quite broad, an adaptation that increases maneuverability in forested habitats and is shared by other raptors in similar habitats. The wingspan of the harpy eagle is surpassed by several large eagles that live in more open habitats, such as those in the &quot;Haliaeetus&quot; and &quot;Aquila&quot; genera. The extinct Haast&#x27;s eagle was significantly larger than all extant eagles, including the harpy.

This species is largely silent away from the nest. There, the adults give a penetrating, weak, melancholy scream, with the incubating males&#x27; call described as &quot;whispy screaming or wailing&quot;. The females&#x27; calls while incubating are similar, but are lower-pitched. While approaching the nest with food, the male calls out &quot;rapid chirps, goose-like calls, and occasional sharp screams&quot;. Vocalization in both parents decreases as the nestlings age, while the nestlings become more vocal. The nestlings call &quot;chi-chi-chi...chi-chi-chi-chi&quot;, seemingly in alarm in response to rain or direct sunlight. When humans approach the nest, the nestlings have been described as uttering croaks, quacks, and whistles.

==Distribution and habitat==
Relatively rare and elusive throughout its range, the harpy eagle is found from southern Mexico (incl. Chiapas, Oaxaca and the Yucatán states) and south through Central America, into South America to as far south as Argentina. They can still be seen by tourists and locals in Costa Rica and Panama. As their preferred habitat is rainforest, they nest and hunt predominantly in the emergent layer. The eagle is most common in Brazil, where it is found across the entire country. With the exception of some areas of the aforementioned Panama and Costa Rica, the species is nearly extinct in Central America, likely due to the logging industry’s decimation of much of the Meso-American rainforests. Their habitat is expected to decline further due to climate change. The harpy eagle prefers tropical, lowland rainforests and may also choose to nest within such areas from the canopy to the emergent vegetation. They typically occur below an elevation of , but have been recorded at elevations up to . Within the forests, they hunt in the canopy or, rarely, on the ground, and perch on emergent trees to scout for prey. They do not generally occur in disturbed areas, avoiding humans whenever possible, but regularly visit semi-open forest and pasture mosaic, in hunting forays. Harpies, however, can be found flying over forest borders in a variety of habitats, such as cerrados, caatingas, buriti palm stands, cultivated fields, and cities. They have recently been found in areas where high-grade forestry is practiced.

==Behavior==
===Feeding===

Full grown harpy eagles are at the top of a food chain. They possess the largest talons of any living eagle and have been recorded as carrying prey weighing up to roughly half of their own body weight. This allows them to snatch from tree branches a live sloth and other large prey items. Most commonly, harpy eagles use perch hunting, in which they scan for prey activity while briefly perched between short flights from tree to tree. Upon spotting prey, the eagle quickly dives and grabs it. Sometimes, harpy eagles are &quot;sit-and-wait&quot; predators (common in forest-dwelling raptors), perching for long periods on a high point near an opening, a river, or a salt lick, where many mammals go to attain nutrients. On occasion, they may also hunt by flying within or above the canopy. They have also been observed tail-chasing: pursuing another bird in flight, rapidly dodging among trees and branches, a predation style common to hawks (genus &quot;Accipiter&quot;) that hunt birds.

A recent literature review and research using camera traps list a total of 116 prey species. Its main prey are tree-dwelling mammals, and a majority of the diet has been shown to focus on sloths. Research conducted by Aguiar-Silva between 2003 and 2005 in a nesting site in Parintins, Amazonas, Brazil, collected remains from prey offered to the nestling by its parents. The researchers found that 79% of the harpy&#x27;s prey was accounted for by sloths from two species: 39% brown-throated sloth (&quot;Bradypus variegatus&quot;), and 40% Linnaeus&#x27;s two-toed sloth (&quot;Choloepus didactylus&quot;). Similar research in Panama, where two captive-bred subadults were released, found that 52% of the male&#x27;s captures and 54% of the female&#x27;s were of two sloth species (brown-throated sloth and Hoffmann&#x27;s two-toed sloth (&quot;Choloepus hoffmanni&quot;). Harpy eagles are capable of hunting all size of sloths, including full-grown adult two-toed sloths weighing up to .

Another major prey of harpy eagles is monkeys. At several nests in Guyana, monkeys made up about 37% of the prey remains found at the nests. Similarly, cebid monkeys made up 35% of the remains found at 10 nests in Amazonian Ecuador. Monkeys regularly taken include capuchin monkeys, saki monkeys, howler monkeys, titi monkeys, squirrel monkeys, and spider monkeys. Smaller monkeys, such as tamarins and marmosets, are, however, seemingly ignored as prey by this species. Small monkeys typically weighing between , such as Wedge-capped capuchin (&quot;Cebus olivaceus&quot;), tufted capuchin (&quot;Sapajus apella&quot;), and white-faced saki (&quot;Pithecia pithecia&quot;) are the most frequently taken. Larger howler monkeys are also taken, mainly Colombian red howler (&quot;Alouatta seniculus&quot;), but also Guyanan red howler (&quot;Alouatta macconnelli&quot;) and mantled howler (&quot;Alouatta palliata&quot;). These monkeys typically weigh between and female harpy eagles can prey on all ages and sexes, while male harpy eagles tend to focus on juveniles. In one study, breeding harpy eagles hunted Yucatán black howler (&quot;Alouatta pigra&quot;), the largest howler monkey which can weigh between , although the ages of the monkeys taken by these eagles are unknown. Nevertheless, adults of other large monkeys can be taken by female harpy eagles, including woolly monkey (&quot;Lagothrix cana&quot;) and Peruvian spider monkey (&quot;Ateles chamek&quot;), and red-faced spider monkey (&quot;Ateles paniscus&quot;) which can weigh around and possibly exceeding in large males.

Other partially arboreal and even land mammals are also preyed on given the opportunity. In the Pantanal, a pair of nesting eagles preyed largely on the porcupine (&quot;Coendou prehensilis&quot;) and the agouti (&quot;Dasyprocta azarae&quot;). Both species of tamanduas (&quot;Tamandua mexicana&quot; &amp; &quot;T. tetradactyla&quot;) are taken and armadillos, especially nine-banded armadillo (&quot;Dasypus novemcinctus&quot;) are also taken, as well as carnivores such as kinkajous (&quot;Potos flavus&quot;), coatis (&quot;Nasua nasua&quot; &amp; &quot;N. narcia&quot;), tayras (&quot;Eira barbara&quot;), and occasionally margays (&quot;Leopardus wiedii&quot;) and crab-eating foxes (&quot;Cerdocyon thous&quot;). In one instant, an adult greater grison (&quot;Galictis vittata&quot;) was killed and partly consumed by subadult female harpy eagle. Those carnivoran prey species usually weigh around , but there is a report that harpy eagles prey on possibly larger carnivores such as ocelot (&quot;Leopardus pardalis&quot;) and adult crab-eating raccoon respectively. Other mammals, such as young peccaries, deer fawns, squirrels and opossums are additionally taken.

The eagle may also attack bird species such as macaws: At the Parintins research site, the red-and-green macaw (&quot;Ara chloropterus&quot;) made up for 0.4% of the prey base, with other birds amounting to 4.6%. Other parrots have also been preyed on, as well as cracids such as curassows and other birds like seriemas. In one occasion, dependent juvenile male eagle quickly learned how to hunt black vultures (&quot;Coragyps atratus&quot;) and accounted for 9 of our 10 records of harpy predation on vultures. Additional prey items reported include reptiles such as iguanas, tegus, snakes, and amphisbaenids. In Suriname, green iguanas (&quot;Iguana iguana&quot;) can be important prey source, and predation on yellow-footed tortoise (&quot;Chelonoidis denticulata&quot;) have been recorded twice.

The eagle has been recorded as taking domestic livestock, including chickens, lambs, goats, and young pigs, but this is extremely rare under normal circumstances. They control the population of mesopredators such as capuchin monkeys, which prey extensively on bird&#x27;s eggs and which (if not naturally controlled) may cause local extinctions of sensitive species.

Males usually take relatively smaller prey, with a typical range of or about half their own weight. The larger females take larger prey, with a minimum recorded prey weight of around . Adult female harpies regularly grab large male howler or spider monkeys or mature sloths weighing in flight and fly off without landing, an enormous feat of strength. Prey items taken to the nest by the parents are normally medium-sized, having been recorded from . The prey brought to the nest by males averaged , while the prey brought to the nest by females averaged . In another study, floaters (i.e. birds not engaging in breeding at that time) were found to take larger prey, averaging , than those that were nesting, for which prey averaged , with prey species estimated to weigh a mean of (for common opossum) to (for adult crab-eating raccoon). Overall, harpy eagle prey weigh between , with the mean prey size equalling 

===Breeding===
In ideal habitats, nests would be fairly close together. In some parts of Panama and Guyana, active nests were located away from one another, while they are within of each other in Venezuela. In Peru, the average distance between nests was and the average area occupied by each breeding pairs was estimated at . In less ideal areas, with fragmented forest, breeding territories were estimated at . The female harpy eagle lays two white eggs in a large stick nest, which commonly measures deep and across and may be used over several years. Nests are located high up in a tree, usually in the main fork, at , depending on the stature of the local trees. The harpy often builds its nest in the crown of the kapok tree, one of the tallest trees in South America. In many South American cultures, cutting down the kapok tree is considered bad luck, which may help safeguard the habitat of this stately eagle. The bird also uses other huge trees on which to build its nest, such as the Brazil nut tree. A nesting site found in the Brazilian Pantanal was built on a &quot;cambará&quot; tree (&quot;Vochysia divergens&quot;).

No display is known between pairs of eagles, and they are believed to mate for life. A pair of harpy eagles usually only raises one chick every 2–3 years. After the first chick hatches, the second egg is ignored and normally fails to hatch unless the first egg perishes. The egg is incubated around 56 days. When the chick is 36 days old, it can stand and walk awkwardly. The chick fledges at the age of 6 months, but the parents continue to feed it for another 6 to 10 months. The male captures much of the food for the incubating female and later the eaglet, but also takes an incubating shift while the female forages and also brings prey back to the nest. Breeding maturity is not reached until birds are 4 to 6 years of age. Adults can be aggressive toward humans who disturb the nesting site or appear to be a threat to their young.

==Status and conservation==
Although the harpy eagle still occurs over a considerable range, its distribution and populations have dwindled considerably. It is threatened primarily by habitat loss due to the expansion of logging, cattle ranching, agriculture, and prospecting. Secondarily, it is threatened by being hunted as an actual threat to livestock and/or a supposed one to human life, due to its great size. Although not actually known to prey on humans and only rarely on domestic stock, the species&#x27; large size and nearly fearless behaviour around humans reportedly make it an &quot;irresistible target&quot; for hunters. Such threats apply throughout its range, in large parts of which the bird has become a transient sight only; in Brazil, it was all but wiped out from the Atlantic rainforest and is only found in appreciable numbers in the most remote parts of the Amazon basin; a Brazilian journalistic account of the mid-1990s already complained that at the time it was only found in significant numbers in Brazilian territory on the northern side of the Equator. Scientific 1990s records, however, suggest that the harpy Atlantic Forest population may be migratory. Subsequent research in Brazil has established that, as of 2009, the harpy eagle, outside the Brazilian Amazon, is critically endangered in Espírito Santo, São Paulo and Paraná, endangered in Rio de Janeiro, and probably extirpated in Rio Grande do Sul (where a recent (March 2015) record was set for the Parque Estadual do Turvo) and Minas Gerais – the actual size of their total population in Brazil is unknown.

Globally, the harpy eagle is considered vulnerable by IUCN and threatened with extinction by CITES (appendix I). The Peregrine Fund until recently considered it a &quot;conservation-dependent species&quot;, meaning it depends on a dedicated effort for captive breeding and release to the wild, as well as habitat protection, to prevent it from reaching endangered status, but now has accepted the near threatened status. The harpy eagle is considered critically endangered in Mexico and Central America, where it has been extirpated in most of its former range; in Mexico, it used to be found as far north as Veracruz, but today probably occurs only in Chiapas in the Selva Zoque. It is considered as near threatened or vulnerable in most of the South American portion of its range; at the southern extreme of its range, in Argentina, it is found only in the Parana Valley forests at the province of Misiones. It has disappeared from El Salvador, and almost so from Costa Rica.

===National initiatives===
Various initiatives for restoration of the species are in place in various countries. Since 2002, the Peregrine Fund initiated a conservation and research program for the harpy eagle in the Darién Province. A similar—and grander, given the dimensions of the countries involved—research project is occurring in Brazil, at the National Institute of Amazonian Research, through which 45 known nesting locations (updated to 62, only three outside the Amazonian basin and all three inactive) are being monitored by researchers and volunteers from local communities. A harpy eagle chick has been fitted with a radio transmitter that allows it to be tracked for more than three years via a satellite signal sent to the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research. Also, a photographic recording of a nest site in the Carajás National Forest was made for the Brazilian edition of &quot;National Geographic Magazine&quot;.

In Panama, the Peregrine Fund carried out a captive-breeding and release project that released a total of 49 birds in Panama and Belize. The Peregrine Fund has also carried out a research and conservation project on this species since the year 2000, making it the longest-running study on harpy eagles.

In Belize, the Belize Harpy Eagle Restoration Project began in 2003 with the collaboration of Sharon Matola, founder and director of the Belize Zoo and the Peregrine Fund. The goal of this project was the re-establishment of the harpy eagle within Belize. The population of the eagle declined as a result of forest fragmentation, shooting, and nest destruction, resulting in near extirpation of the species. Captive-bred harpy eagles were released in the Rio Bravo Conservation and Management Area in Belize, chosen for its quality forest habitat and linkages with Guatemala and Mexico. Habitat linkage with Guatemala and Mexico were important for conservation of quality habitat and the harpy eagle on a regional level. As of November 2009, 14 harpy eagles have been released and are monitored by the Peregrine Fund, through satellite telemetry.

In January 2009, a chick from the all-but-extirpated population in the Brazilian state of Paraná was hatched in captivity at the preserve kept in the vicinity of the Itaipu Dam by the Brazilian/Paraguayan state-owned company Itaipu Binacional. In September 2009, an adult female, after being kept captive for 12 years in a private reservation, was fitted with a radio transmitter before being restored to the wild in the vicinity of the Pau Brasil National Park (formerly Monte Pascoal NP), in the state of Bahia.

In December 2009, a 15th harpy eagle was released into the Rio Bravo Conservation and Management Area in Belize. The release was set to tie in with the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009, in Copenhagen. The 15th eagle, nicknamed &quot;Hope&quot; by the Peregrine officials in Panama, was the &quot;poster child&quot; for forest conservation in Belize, a developing country, and the importance of these activities in relation to climate change. The event received coverage from Belize&#x27;s major media entities, and was supported and attended by the U.S. Ambassador to Belize, Vinai Thummalapally, and British High Commissioner to Belize, Pat Ashworth.

In Colombia, as of 2007, an adult male and a subadult female confiscated from wildlife trafficking were restored to the wild and monitored in Paramillo National Park in Córdoba, and another couple was being kept in captivity at a research center for breeding and eventual release. A monitoring effort with the help of volunteers from local Native American communities is also being made in Ecuador, including the joint sponsorship of various Spanish universities—this effort being similar to another one going on since 1996 in Peru, centred around a native community in the Tambopata Province, Madre de Dios Region. Another monitoring project, begun in 1992, was operating as of 2005 in the state of Bolívar, Venezuela.

==In human culture==
The harpy eagle is the national bird of Panama and is depicted on the coat of arms of Panama. The 15th harpy eagle released in Belize, named &quot;Hope&quot;, was dubbed &quot;Ambassador for Climate Change&quot;, in light of the United Nations Climate Change Conference 2009.

The bird appeared on the reverse side of the Venezuelan Bs.F 2,000 note.

The harpy eagle was the inspiration behind the design of Fawkes the Phoenix in the Harry Potter film series. A live harpy eagle was used to portray the now-extinct Haast&#x27;s eagle in BBC&#x27;s &quot;Monsters We Met&quot;.

===Indigenous cultures===
In Aztec religion the harpy eagle was sacred to Quetzalcoatl.

<doc id="357980" wikidata="Q4923444" url="?curid=357980" title="Street fighting">
<text>Street fighting is hand-to-hand combat in public places between individuals or groups of people. The venue is usually a public place (e.g., a street), and the fight sometimes results in serious injury or even death. Some street fights can be gang related.

A typical situation involves two men arguing in a bar, during which dispute one suggests stepping outside, where the fight commences. It is often possible to avoid the fight by withdrawing from the situation; whereas in self-defense, a person is actively trying to escape the confrontation, using force if necessary to ensure his own safety.

In some martial arts communities, street fighting and self-defense are often considered synonymous.

Evidence for human fighting goes back 430,000 years in Spain, where a fossil skull was found with two fractures apparently caused by the same object, implying an intentional lethal attack. Another record of early human fighting is one that happened 9,500 to 10,500 years ago in Nataruk, Kenya. The hunter-gatherers fight was a group fight involving both males and females, including children, armed with bladelets and arrow projectiles. The fight was to protect their valuables such as lands, food and water resources and their tribes or families or to respond mortally to the threat from the encounter between two groups of people.

==Characteristic==

Street fights can be planned ahead or occur suddenly, regardless of location and time. The frequency of physical assaults is based on crime rates, level of poverty and accessibility to weapons. In street fights, everyone can be an opponent, including friends, relatives or even strangers. Street fights usually start with an outbreak of emotion such as anger, fear and indignation. Street fights do not last long, usually running for minutes or even seconds. The outcome of the fight is unpredictable due to the fact that participants are unlikely to know others&#x27; abilities, strengths or weaknesses.

The scene can go beyond expectation with the introduction of weapons or the participation of someone from the crowd, whether intentional or unintentional. In the past , only when an opponent died could the other participant be considered the winner. Similarly, at present, the match is only over when one surrenders, or both are unable to continue, when someone from the crowd or the police or a security guard stops the fight or &quot;steps in&quot; or when one of the combatants dies. Despite the brutal and life-threatening consequences, people&#x27;s willingness to commit violence has increased over time , escalating the danger of street fights.

==Causes==
The causes of street fighting are varied. Originally, street fighting was a way of defending oneself. In the stone age, fights were mostly aimed for survival purposes – protecting territory, securing resources and defending families. According to Mike Martin, a London lecturer in war studies, &quot;Humans fight to achieve status and belonging. They do so because, in evolutionary terms, these are the surest routes to survival and increased reproduction&quot;.

As humans evolve, new conflicts arise in order to gratify more sophisticated wants. The purposes of street fighting shifted to solve interpersonal conflicts. These conflicts could be stratification, misunderstanding, hate speech or even retaliation. For instance, in areas that are not under police surveillance and criminally dominated, violence is believed to be the substantiation of superior reputation and pride. In other words, people take part in street fights to obtain dominance because of social status given to the ruler. For another instance, men showed off their value in the sense that opponents&#x27; self-esteem is on the verge of being destroyed from their insults, humiliation and vilification to which violence is the go-to resort. Additionally, some fights are driven by alcohol. Alcohol itself does not directly lead to violence but it acts as a catalyst, allowing cheers from the crowds or provocation from opponents to ignite the fight between fighters. Since the consumption of alcohol negatively impacts the brain function, drunk people fail to assess the situation which often results in overreacting and unpredictable fights.

==Effects==

===Biological===
It is theorized that certain biological features of the &quot;Homo&quot; lineage have evolved over time as a means to mitigate injury from hand-to-hand combat. Facial robusticity, which includes traits such as jaw adductor muscle strength and brow ridge size, may offer a protective effect against combat. The jaw adductors (the masseter and the temporalis) stretch as a means to absorb energy from the punch in order to reduce the likelihood of jaw dislocation and prevent fracture. The postcanine teeth may have evolved to be larger and thicker so as to allow the energy from the punch to be transferred from the jaw to the skull. Additionally, the proportion of the human hands have evolved in a way that allows for the formation of a fist, something that was not possible in pre-&quot;Homo&quot; species.

===Physical and mental health===
The consequences of street fighting are undeniably dangerous and critical, and street fighters are exposed to short-term and long-term physical health issues. Such poor health includes temporary and permanent disabilities, fractures, partial body part losses, severe injuries, or death. For instance, the face, other parts of the head and neck, and the thorax are the most targeted parts in the body, which account for 83%, 4% and 2% of fractures, respectively, amongst all injuries. In addition to damaging physical health, street fighting can also result in mental illness, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse and depression. Extreme feelings of guilt experienced by some perpetrators in the aftermath of a violent event may lead to suicide.

Not only does the involvement in street fights affect the participants, it also collaterally influences the participants&#x27; family members and friends, especially small children. Traumatic exposure in small children to such negative experience often leads to post-traumatic stress reactions, such as fear, sadness, numbness, timidity, moodiness, eating disorders, difficulty sleeping, or nightmares. Adults have the high probability of coping with trauma, even when they do not sustain direct injuries, leading to increases in preterm birth, mortality rate, and communal trauma.

===Legal===
Street fighting is usually illegal due to its disruption of public order. Depending on each localities&#x27; laws and the gravity of the situation, participants may be liable to either a fine or imprisonment. In South Australia, for example, the maximum penalty for the offence of fighting in public is a $1,250 fine or three months imprisonment. In New South Wales, Australia, persons involved in a fight that could intimidate the public can be charged by the police for the offence of affray with a maximum punishment of ten years imprisonment. If any injuries are caused during the fight, the severity of the injury will impact the penalty of the participants. Intentional injuries, especially, will result in more severe penalties. One may still be liable for the injuries of the victim even if the injuries were not directly caused by that person but by another participating in the fight. If someone dies, all members in the group that are involved in the assault may be accused of murder, no matter who inflicted the fatal blow. Self-defence is generally too narrow to provide protection.

===Economic===
In terms of economics, street fights result in damage to social infrastructure. In 2000, a fund worth approximately 9 million euros was spent in order to repair previous three-year demolition done by street fighters. In 1995 in Basque city, the destruction of public transport resulting from street fights cost 2.5 million euros.

==Underground street fight clubs==

Street fights used to happen in the dark, out of communal sight. With the exposure to social media, however, street fights have become more transparent. Organisers that help with professional street fight setup are known as &quot;clubs&quot;, which are run on a money-oriented basis. These clubs can host either amateur underground fights or professional ones. In New York, professional fighters are those who contend for the prize (money or gift) which has monetary value exceeding $75. In contrast, amateur fights also known as &#x27;smokers&#x27; refer to unsanctioned fights where no safeguards and regulations are required.

Despite the fact that some illegal fight clubs still run within the authorisers&#x27; competence, some street fight clubs even obtain authoritative approval, meaning these sanctioning entities are running under the supervision of a certified regulator. Some further requirements for professional fights enacted by New York State Athletics Commission (NYSAC) include:

* Medical check-ups for participants before and after the fight
* A minimum attendance of one commission-designated doctor and an ambulance with medical personnel equipped with appropriate resuscitation kits to be on scene
* Medical insurance must be provided to participants
* The venue must meet safety requirements

Pre-fight medical check-ups are required to ensure that the participants are not involved with drugs or infectious diseases such as HIV, Hepatitis or any other illnesses. Any fights that are not in compliance with the authoriser rules and regulations are considered illegal and the participants will have to face legal penalty. The venue of the fight is changed every time for confidential protection and will be announced on the fight day. The promoters are in charge of finding different locations to host these fights where indoor boxing rings, gyms or gym mats with crowd-form barricade are utilised as a disguise so as not to attract the public attention. Amongst incentives that draw people into underground street fights, money oriented and attention seeking are the two most fundamental one. In order to qualify for the fight, attendees have to go through a registration process. The fight is either between two randomly matched applicants whose identity will be kept until the matching day or between two attendees with unresolved conflicts. Sometimes, it can be between 2 fighters urging to start their MMA career that get matched right on the registration spot. Attendees are required to comply with the rules set by the club. The grant price is usually given to the winner only, but sometimes both people can be paid. The club is funded by entrance tickets sold to audiences with undisclosed amounts. The audience may have to go through a security check for weapons as they are not allowed inside the venue. On several occasions, the audience gamble on the result of the fight, particularly, they place their bet on one of the attendees that they expect to win in the hope of a worthy return. The fight lasts for three rounds, sometimes an additional round is conducted because the crowd&#x27;s provocation fuels the combativeness of the attendees.

<text>John Samuel Mbiti (1931–2019) was a Kenyan-born Christian philosopher and writer. He was an ordained Anglican priest, and is considered &quot;the father of modern African theology&quot;.

==Early life==

John Mbiti was born on 30 November 1931 in Mulango, Kitui County, eastern Kenya. His parents were two farmers, Samuel Mutuvi Ngaangi and Valesi Mbandi Kiimba. He was one of six children and was raised in a strong Christian environment. His Christian upbringing encouraged his educational journey through the African Inland Church. He attended Alliance High School in Nairobi and continued his education at University College of Makerere where he graduated in 1953. Mbiti furthered his academic education in the US and received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1956 and a Bachelor of Theology degree in 1957 from Barrington College, a Christian liberal arts school in Rhode Island. He then earned his Doctor of Philosophy in theology at the University of Cambridge, from where he graduated in 1963. Supervised by C.F.D. Moule, his doctoral work sought to answer the question, &quot;How can African societies be effectively evangelized so that the Christian faith can penetrate deeply and firmly into the African soil?&quot;

==Later life and death==
Mbiti taught religion and theology in Makerere University, Uganda, from 1964 to 1974 and was subsequently director of the World Council of Churches&#x27; Ecumenical Institute in Bogis-Bossey, Switzerland. He held visiting professorships at universities across the world and published extensively on philosophy, theology and African oral traditions.

Mbiti&#x27;s seminal book, &quot;African Religions and Philosophy&quot; (1969), was the first work to challenge Christian assumption that traditional African religious ideas were &quot;demonic and anti-Christian&quot;. His sympathetic treatment of traditional religions was based on massive field work. Mbiti was clear that his interpretation of these religions was from a firmly Christian perspective, and this aspect of his work was sometimes severely criticized.

Mbiti&#x27;s research interests included theology in Africa and Asia, and ecumenism. He also collaborated on a book of African proverbs, collected from across the continent.

From 2005 up until his death in 2019, Mbiti was an emeritus professor at the University of Bern and a retired parish minister to the town of Burgdorf, Switzerland. He was married to Verena Mbiti-Siegenthaler and had four children and five grand-children. Mbiti died in Burgdorf on 5 October 2019.

== Religious work ==

After graduating from Cambridge University he was ordained an Anglican priest of the Church of England. He served as a parish priest in England until he returned to Makerere in 1964 to teach traditional African religions. From 1980 to 1996 Mbiti was a parish minister in Burgdorf, Switzerland and taught at the same time from 1983 onwards at the University of Bern.

== Academic work ==

Mbiti returned to Makerere University, where he taught African traditional religion from 1964 to 1974. While he was here he wrote his first book, &quot;African Religions and Philosophy&quot; (1969). His primary focus in his first book was to challenge the widely held views that African traditional religions were rooted in demonic anti-Christian values and to stress that traditional African religions deserve the same respect as Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism. He based his claim on his knowledge that in the Bible, God is the creator of all things, therefore meaning that God has revealed himself to all things. Mbiti had little knowledge of African Traditional religion, as he was unaware of previous lectures regarding its foundations due to the deep oral traditions of such religions. He sought out his own personal research to teach the class. He gathered ideas from over 300 African peoples or tribes while conducting field research. Being asked by his students for a collection of his research compelled him to compile his notes and lectures into his first book, which was published in 1969. Following his career at Makerere, he held visiting professorships at universities across the world where he continued publishing books on philosophy, theology and African oral traditions.

From 1974 to 1980 Mbiti was the director of the World Council of Churches Bossey Ecumenical Institute. He held a series of influential conferences that focused on intercultural theology. His goal was to bring together African, Asian and other theologians for ecumenical encounter and dialogue. The first conference in June 1976 focused on African and Asian contributions to contemporary theology. This conference had an attendance of more than 80 participants. His second more well-known conference, &quot;Confessing Christ in Different Cultures&quot;, was held in Bossey in July 1977. This conference held an attendance of more than 100 people who gathered from 35 different countries. There were discussions on how an individual could reach from a contextual to a universal confession of Christ and emphasized how confession can find expression in liturgy and worship. His third conference focused on &quot;Indigenous Theology and the Universal Church&quot;.

Upon his retirement as a parish minister (1996) and university lecturer (2005) in Switzerland, Mbiti translated the entire New Testament from its original manuscripts in Greek and Hebrew into his mothertongue Kikamba, a Bantu language spoken by the Kamba people of Kenya (and Tanzania).

Among the numerous prestigious distinctions and honorary doctorates Mbiti received, the Anglican Church of Southern Africa honored Mbiti with the Archbishop’s Award for Peace and Justice during a celebration of his life and writing at the University of Stellenbosch, Republic of South Africa, in November 2016.

== Findings in African traditional religion ==

Mbiti in his book looks to dissect the origins of African traditional religion, specifically by studying oral traditions. The Igbo religion is one of the traditional African religions that Mbiti researched; their tradition was rooted in their culture. Received orally by authorities, this tradition was transmitted from generation to generation through the same oral process. Their traditions revolve around a highly ontological phenomena, pushing their followers to question their existence and being. Within their traditional life, individuals immersed themselves with religious participation, in which they believe starts before they are born and continues after their death. The Igbo religious life is connected to their ancestors and to those not yet born creating a mystic continuum. The Igbo religion fully embodies all characteristics of a traditional world religion, including its beliefs, sacred myths, oral qualities, strong appeal to the hearts of its followers, a high degree of ritualization, and possession of numerous participatory parsonages such as officiating elders, kings, priests and diviners. The Igbo religion differs from nontraditional proselytizing religions because it does not have elders who carry out missionary work and individuals who do not preach their religion onto others. They believe in a supreme being who is believed to be the controller of the world and all its inhabitants.

Mbiti also discovered that the Igbo religion considers that when an individual dies, their soul or spirit wanders until the body is given a proper burial. This waiting period is called the transitional period of the deceased. Christianity arrived in Igbo land in 1857, creating fear within the Igbo that if they became Christians their god would bring disaster to them. Others also refused to convert to Christianity because of the belief that Christian missionaries were there to destroy the Igbo religion. Christians attacked the traditional song music and dance of the Igbo religion as they deemed it immoral. This may have contributed to the emergence of religious conflict between the Igbo and the Christians, and the impression that African traditional religions were rooted in anti-Christian belief. Elders were merely protecting their traditions. One of Mbiti&#x27;s most famous quotes in his book &quot;African Religions and Philosophy&quot; was: &quot;Wherever the African is, there is religion.&quot;

== Criticisms ==

Mbiti faced criticism from the Ugandan writer Okot p&#x27;Bitek for casting his arguments in intellectual terms that had been established by the west. Specifically, his biggest criticism was that African cosmologies ultimately align with Christian views of God as omnipotent, omnipresent and eternal. P’Bitek wrote in his own book &quot;African Religions in Western Scholarship&quot; that the African traditional religions are beyond recognition to the ordinary Africans in the countryside. Mbiti supposedly never responded to the criticism, according to Derek Peterson, a professor of history and African studies at the University of Michigan.

Similarly, Tsenay Serequeberhan placed Mbiti in the tradition of ethnophilosophy and argued that Mbiti tries to &quot;expose the interiority of the African to the subversive gaze of the Christian, Muslim, or modernizing Europeanized African.&quot;

<text>Enguera () is a municipality in southwestern province of Valencia, Spain.

The local economy depends primarily on agriculture, and secondarily on industry and services. In recent years, agricultural crops, especially olives, have gained in importance, although the complementary or secondary component of agriculture is evident. Rural tourism, including camping, country homes, a hotel, and restaurants are gaining importance. Meanwhile, the once-flourishing industry that was an important part of the village economy at the end of the eighteenth century has faded almost to nothing. While many of Enguera&#x27;s inhabitants work in industry, their jobs are in nearby towns.

The Sierra de Enguera is named after this town.

<doc id="358008" wikidata="Q931286" url="?curid=358008" title="Alexander Wilson (ornithologist)">
<text>Alexander Wilson (July 6, 1766 – August 23, 1813) was a Scottish-American poet, ornithologist, naturalist, and illustrator. Identified by George Ord as the &quot;Father of American Ornithology&quot;, Wilson is regarded as the greatest American ornithologist before Audubon.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Wilson was born in a Presbyterian family in Paisley, Scotland on July 6, 1766. Alexander senior (&quot;Saunders&quot;) had given up smuggling and taken up weaving where he did well and he supplemented income with liquor distilling. The American revolution had caused economic hardship and after the death of Wilson&#x27;s mother, Mary McNab, his father remarried and moved to Auchinbathie. Wilson got a little bit of schooling but spent time herding livestock and at thirteen he apprenticed with his brother-in-law William Duncan. He also worked four years as a journeyman, shooting grouse in free time and peddling wares across Scotland. 

=== Poetry and emigration ===
While working as a weaver in Paisley, Wilson became seriously interested in poetry. He was inspired by the dialect verse of Robert Burns, who was only seven years older. He was close friends with fellow Paisley poet Ebenezer Picken.

In addition to ballads and pastoral pieces, Wilson wrote satirical commentary on the conditions of weavers in the mills. In 1792 he wrote a poem called &quot;Watty and Meg: A wife reformed&quot; on a drunkard and his wife, which was quite popular. His authorship of a satirical poem &quot;The Shark, or Lang Mills Detected&quot; with severe personal statements about a mill owner named William Sharp resulted in a libel suit. He then began to blackmail Sharp and this led to Wilson&#x27;s arrest. His work was said to be inflammatory, against the English, and libelous; he was often in trouble with the law. Because he devoted little time to his trade as a weaver, Wilson lived in poverty. In 1794, he decided to emigrate to America.

=== From teaching to ornithology ===

With a nephew, Wilson left Scotland in May 1794 at the age of and landed in Delaware. He walked to Philadelphia where he tried work in printing and weaving. Opportunities were scarce for weavers in the Philadelphia area, and Wilson turned to teaching.

Wilson taught at the Milestown School in Bristol Township, the present-day East Oak Lane neighborhood of Philadelphia, for five years from 1796 to 1801. A scandalous affair with a married woman in 1801 forced him to leave. He then moved on to teach briefly in New Jersey.

Eventually, Wilson settled into a position at Gray&#x27;s Ferry, Pennsylvania, and took up residence in nearby Kingsessing. There, he met the famous naturalist William Bartram, who encouraged Wilson&#x27;s interest in ornithology and painting.

Resolved to publish a collection of illustrations of all the birds of North America, Wilson traveled widely, collecting and painting. He also secured subscribers to fund his work, the nine-volume &quot;American Ornithology&quot; (1808–1814). Of the 268 species of birds illustrated in its pages, 26 had not previously been described. His illustrations of birds in poses were an inspiration for James Audubon and other illustrators and naturalists.

In 1813, Wilson was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society.

=== Death ===
Wilson died on August 23, 1813, &quot;of dysentery, overwork, and chronic poverty&quot; according to one report. He was buried in Philadelphia, in the cemetery at Gloria Dei (Old Swedes&#x27;) church. The two final volumes of &quot;American Ornithology&quot; were completed by Wilson&#x27;s friend and patron George Ord, who was an executor of Wilson&#x27;s estate.

An image entitled &quot;Swedish Lutheran Church&quot;, which depicts an apparently elderly individual mourning at the grave of Wilson, was drawn by Thomas Sully (1783–1872), engraved and printed in 1828 by Cephas G. Childs and B. Rogers, respectively, and published in a book of landscapes, &quot;Views of Philadelphia&quot; (1827–1830).

== Legacy ==
In Paisley, a statue of Wilson was erected on the grounds of Paisley Abbey. A memorial on the banks of River Cart, near the Hammills rapids and waterfall, commemorates Wilson&#x27;s connection to that city. The memorial is inscribed &quot;Remember Alexander Wilson 1766–1813. Here was his boyhood playground.&quot;

A genus of warblers, &quot;Wilsonia&quot; (now obsolete), was named for Wilson by Charles Lucien Bonaparte. Several species of bird were also named in honor of Wilson, including the Wilson&#x27;s storm-petrel, Wilson&#x27;s plover, Wilson&#x27;s phalarope, Wilson&#x27;s snipe, and Wilson&#x27;s warbler. In 2023, the American Ornithological Society decided to rename Wilson&#x27;s warbler and Wilson&#x27;s snipe. 

According to an article about his life, Wilson&#x27;s meeting with James Audubon &quot;probably inspired Audubon to publish his own book on birds, and he also influenced many later artists and ornithologists&quot;.

&quot;The Wilson Journal of Ornithology&quot; and the Wilson Ornithological Society also bear his name.

<doc id="358011" wikidata="Q3244413" url="?curid=358011" title="List of people on the postage stamps of Ireland">
<text>This is a list of people on stamps of Ireland, including the years when they appeared on a stamp.

Because no Irish stamps were designed prior to 1929, the first Irish stamps issued by the Provisional Government of Ireland were the then-current British definitive postage stamps bearing a portrait of George V that were overprinted &quot;Rialtas Sealadaċ na hÉireann 1922&quot; (translates as Provisional Government of Ireland 1922) and issued on 17 February 1922. The overprint was later changed to &quot;Saorstát Éireann 1922&quot; (Irish Free State 1922).

The Irish Free State issued the first commemorative stamps depicting a person on 22 June 1929 when &quot;Oifig an Phoist&quot;, the Irish Post Office, a section of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, issued a set of three stamps showing Daniel O&#x27;Connell. O&#x27;Connell is one of a small number of people shown in two issues, including Wolfe Tone and Arthur Guinness. The 2009 Guinness issue included postmarks with his trade mark signature, a first in philately.

The Department of Posts and Telegraphs and, after 1984, An Post, designed stamps showing statesmen, religious, literary and cultural figures, athletes, etc. Until the mid-1990s it was usual policy not to issue stamps showing living persons, the only exceptions being Douglas Hyde (stamp 1943, d. 1949, &quot;illustrated below&quot;) and Louis le Brocquy (stamp 1977, d. 2012, &quot;illustrated below&quot;), but this policy has been put aside and there have recently been several issues showing living persons. For the millennium, 30 millennium stamps were issued showing living Irish sportsmen.

During the release of the 2022 Irish Oscar Winners stamps, An Post&#x27;s retain managing director stated that &quot;The Irish Oscar Winners stamps celebrate the best in the business and serve as a reminder of what we, as Irish people, can achieve.&quot;

<doc id="358013" wikidata="Q4964474" url="?curid=358013" title="Brian Lehrer">
<text>Brian Lehrer (born October 5, 1952) is an American radio talk show host on New York City&#x27;s public radio station WNYC. His daily two-hour 2007 Peabody Award-winning program, &quot;The Brian Lehrer Show&quot;, features interviews with newsmakers and experts about current events and social issues. Lehrer was formerly an anchor and reporter for NBC Radio Networks and has been in broadcast journalism for over 30 years.

==Early life and education==
Lehrer was born in Queens and grew up in the neighborhood of Bayside. He went to Bayside High School. His parents, both children of Jewish immigrants from Poland, grew up in the South Bronx and met in high school.

Lehrer obtained B.A. degrees in Music and Mass Communications from the State University of New York at Albany. While a student there, he hosted a radio program on the college radio station WSUA which has since become WCDB Albany. Lehrer also hosted radio programs in Columbus, Ohio, and Norfolk, Virginia.

He holds a Master of Public Health degree from the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health and a master&#x27;s degree in journalism from Ohio State University. In 2012, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters from Montclair State University.

== Career ==

===&quot;The Brian Lehrer Show&quot;===

Lehrer has been hosting his show, originally called &quot;On the Line&quot;, since its inception in 1989. The show was conceived in part as a response to the 1987 abolishment of the Fairness Doctrine, which required broadcast license holders to portray controversial topics in a balanced and equitable manner.

The format is interviews with newsmakers, combined with listener phone calls. Newsmakers are local, national and international, often authors on book tours, or metropolitan area politicians, including both of New York&#x27;s senators, and most congress, state and city representatives from the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut area. Sometimes guests are less-famous individuals affected by the news, like Brooklyn residents on the site of giant housing developments or neighbors of noisy Manhattan night clubs.

From 2016 until 2021, Lehrer hosted the weekly &quot;Ask the Mayor&quot; segment, where the mayor of New York City directly answers questions from callers. The monthly segment, &quot;Speak to the Speaker&quot;, which hosts City Council Speaker Corey Johnson, provides another opportunity for callers to engage with local politicians.

Frequent topics are housing, health care, transportation, education, and other government functions; the arts; the experience of living in New York and the surrounding area; and international affairs, such as the Iraq war or Israel/Palestinian conflict, particularly from a New York perspective. Lehrer&#x27;s programs often use &quot;The New York Times&quot; for leads and guests. He tries to maintain a balance between issues as they affect listeners and &quot;horse-race&quot; pundit discussions of politics.

Prominent political guests include Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Mitch McConnell, and Kellyanne Conway. Other guests also include musician Wynton Marsalis, author Margaret Atwood, author Junot Diaz, filmmaker Judd Apatow, writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and baseball player Yogi Berra, among others.

The show won a 2007 Peabody Award &quot;for facilitating reasoned conversation about critical issues and opening it up to everyone within earshot.&quot;

===CUNY TV shows===
Lehrer hosted a cable TV talk show called &quot;BrianLehrer.TV&quot; (formerly &quot;Brian Lehrer Live&quot;) on CUNY TV (channel 75 on New York City cable systems) from 2005 to 2015. In 2009 the show was nominated for a regional New York Emmy Award. He hosted &quot;POTUS 2017 from&quot; September 2015–August 2017. From October 2017–May 2018, Lehrer hosted the weekly CUNY TV show &quot;Brian Talks New York&quot;.

===Other work===
Lehrer&#x27;s op-ed pieces have appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, The &quot;New York Sun&quot;, &quot;Newsday&quot;, and the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, and on Slate. His WNYC commentaries are also distributed globally on the NPR website.

Lehrer was a questioner in the WABC-TV New York City Mayoral debates in 1997, 2001, and 2005. Since 1997, Lehrer has been a moderator in every New York City mayoral election.

He has appeared on television as a commentator on New York 1, WNET Channel 13, and CNNfn, and hosted public affairs shows on WPXN-TV and WNET from 1990 to 1998.

Lehrer was the recipient of the New York Associated Press (NYAP) Broadcasters &quot;Best Interview&quot; Award in 2000 for an interview with a rape survivor, and in 2001 for his role as moderator on NYC radio of the only mayoral primary debate between Michael Bloomberg and Herman Badillo. Since 2000, Lehrer has been awarded seven &quot;Best Interview&quot; awards from the NYAP. During his tenure as host of NPR&#x27;s &quot;On the Media&quot;, the national program was named &quot;Best Weekly Show&quot; by the Public Radio News Directors in 1999.

He currently moderates several major public forums, including &quot;The Nation&quot; vs. &quot;The Economist&quot; series and the Harper&#x27;s Forum series, and has moderated or hosted major events for the American Museum of Natural History and Westinghouse Science Foundation, among others.

<doc id="358014" wikidata="Q6262950" url="?curid=358014" title="John Walvoord">
<text>John Flipse Walvoord (May 1, 1910 – December 20, 2002) was a Christian theologian, pastor, and president of Dallas Theological Seminary from 1952 to 1986. He authored over 30 books, focusing primarily on eschatology and theology, including &quot;The Rapture Question&quot;, and was co-editor of &quot;The Bible Knowledge Commentary&quot; with Roy B. Zuck. He earned the degrees of Bachelor of Arts and Doctor of Divinity from Wheaton College, a Master of Arts degree from Texas Christian University in philosophy, a Bachelor of Theology, Master of Theology, and Doctor of Theology in systematic theology from Dallas Theological Seminary, and a Litt.D. from Liberty Baptist Seminary.

==History==
Walvoord was brought up in a Christian home but had little interest in the faith until he was fifteen, when his family moved to Racine after his father accepted a position as superintendent of the junior high. They joined the Union Gospel Tabernacle, where Walvoord committed his life to Jesus Christ after attending a Bible study on Galatians.

After continuing his education at Wheaton College, Walvoord went on to Texas Christian University and then Dallas Theological Seminary, where he completed his Th.D. in 1936. Seminary president and mentor Lewis Sperry Chafer appointed Walvoord to the position of registrar. During Walvoord&#x27;s tenure, he also taught systematic theology at the seminary, and pastored the Rosen Heights Baptist Church in Fort Worth. Walvoord became more involved in the administration of the school, serving as Chafer&#x27;s assistant and secretary to the faculty. Upon Chafer&#x27;s death in 1952, he became the seminary&#x27;s second president, serving until his retirement in 1986.

In addition to his responsibilities at the seminary, Walvoord earned a reputation as one of the most influential dispensational theologians of the 20th century. He played a prominent role in advocating the doctrine of a rapture of Christians from the earth prior to a time of great tribulation, followed by a literal thousand-year millennial reign of Christ, and a renewed focus of God on the nation of Israel (which he associated with modern-day Jews) as distinct from the Church. As part of his dispensationalist theology, he claimed there was prophetic biblical justification for the restoration of a Jewish state in Palestine. Stephen Sizer, an Anglican priest who is a prominent critic of Christian Zionism, lists Walvoord as one of the &quot;leading dispensationalists who are also overtly Zionist&quot;, including also Charles Ryrie, Dwight Pentecost, Eric Sauer, Charles Dyer and Hal Lindsey, all associated with Dallas Theological Seminary.

<text>Mountain was an American rock band formed on Long Island, New York, in 1969. Originally consisting of vocalist-guitarist Leslie West, bassist-vocalist Felix Pappalardi, keyboardist Steve Knight, and drummer N. D. Smart (soon replaced by Corky Laing), the group disbanded in 1972, but reunited on several occasions prior to West&#x27;s death in 2020. They are best-known for their 1970 smash hit song &quot;Mississippi Queen&quot;, which remains a staple of classic rock radio, as well as the heavily sampled song &quot;Long Red&quot;, and their performance at Woodstock Festival in 1969. Mountain is one of many bands commonly credited with influencing the development of heavy metal music during the 1970s. The group&#x27;s musical style primarily consisted of hard rock, blues rock, and heavy metal.

The beginning of the live recording of their song &quot;Long Red&quot; has become one of the most sampled drum breaks in hip hop, sampled in over 700 songs by artists such as EPMD, Pete Rock &amp; CL Smooth, A Tribe Called Quest, Nas, Kanye West, the Game, among many others. Songs using the sample include Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;99 Problems&quot; and Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;The Glory&quot;.

==History==
===1969–1972===
In early 1969 Leslie West, formerly of the Long Island R&amp;B band The Vagrants, put together a band, Leslie West Mountain, with Norman Landsberg (keyboards, bass) and Ken Janick (drums) and began playing gigs and recording demos. Right around this time, former Cream collaborator/producer Felix Pappalardi, who had previously produced the Vagrants, expressed an interest in producing West&#x27;s work. West, previously disgruntled and unsatisfied with the lack of success in his first project, found Cream to be a great inspiration. He began to feel disillusioned with the R&amp;B and blues scenes of the 1960s in which he had played. He envisioned a project that would take on a rawer and much harder style which he had begun to favor, with his newly-developed guitar style inspired by hearing Cream&#x27;s Eric Clapton.

Pappalardi rejected the demos by the West-Landsberg-Janick trio, but took a suggestion that he play bass on West&#x27;s solo album, &quot;Mountain&quot;. The album also featured Landsberg and former Remains drummer N.D. Smart. The album spotlighted West&#x27;s raw vocals and melodic, bluesy guitar style, and Pappalardi&#x27;s bass lines were prominent. According to West, when Pappalardi asked what would be next, West suggested the pair go on the road. Keyboardist Steve Knight (from Devil&#x27;s Anvil, another of Pappalardi&#x27;s productions) was added after Landsberg left to form another group, Hammer, with Janick.

Naming themselves &quot;Mountain&quot;, after West&#x27;s 1969 solo album, West, Pappalardi, Smart, and Knight played shows on the west coast before getting to play their third concert as a working band at the 1969 Woodstock Festival in Bethel, New York. Mountain was received enthusiastically by the festival audience but the band did not appear in the film of the event, nor was their performance included on volume 1 of the festival&#x27;s . Their performances of &quot;Blood of the Sun&quot; (from West&#x27;s album) and &quot;Theme for an Imaginary Western&quot; (a song they planned to record for &quot;Climbing!&quot; and written by former Cream bassist Jack Bruce) did appear on the second volume of Woodstock performances called &quot;Woodstock II&quot; (Neither of those &quot;live&quot; songs were recorded at Woodstock, however.) The 40th Anniversary Edition of &quot;Woodstock&quot; on DVD and Blu-ray features filmed performances of &quot;Beside The Sea&quot; and &quot;Southbound Train&quot;.

Soon after Woodstock, Smart was replaced by Canadian Laurence &quot;Corky&quot; Laing, who was the drummer on &quot;Climbing!&quot;, which was released in March 1970. It led off with what became the band&#x27;s signature song, &quot;Mississippi Queen&quot;, which reached No. 21 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and was featured in the 1971 cult film &quot;Vanishing Point&quot;, while the album reached No. 17.

Mountain began a hectic touring schedule in the middle of which they recorded a follow-up album, &quot;Nantucket Sleighride&quot;, released in January 1971. This album reached No. 16 but failed to yield a hit single. The title track was used in the UK as the theme to ITV&#x27;s Sunday political program &quot;Weekend World&quot;. After these early releases the band continued to receive a certain measure of critical acclaim but never again achieved great commercial success.

After &quot;Nantucket Sleighride&quot;, the band produced &quot;Flowers of Evil&quot; (November 1971) consisting of one side of studio material and one live side, culled from a concert at New York&#x27;s Fillmore East.

Mountain disbanded in February 1972 after a tour of the UK. West has since cited a combination of drug abuse within the band and Pappalardi&#x27;s road weariness and burgeoning hearing impairment as primary factors. A live album, &quot;Mountain Live: The Road Goes Ever On,&quot; was issued in April 1972.

Pappalardi returned to studio work, while West and Laing formed West, Bruce and Laing with former Cream bassist Jack Bruce. Their first American performance was a Carnegie Hall concert, prompting a bidding war that Columbia Records won, and the new trio cut two studio albums and a live release over the next two years. After Bruce suddenly pulled out of the trio in 1973, West and Laing continued on briefly as Leslie West&#x27;s Wild West Show, which also featured special guest Mitch Ryder plus NYC guitarist Peter Baron and bassist Tom Robb (formerly with Mylon LeFevre&#x27;s band and later with the Marshall Tucker Band).

===Post-1972===
By August 1973, West and Pappalardi had reformed Mountain with Allan Schwartzberg on drums and Bob Mann (ex-Dreams) on keyboards and guitar; the new lineup toured Japan and produced a double live album, &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (February 1974), from the tour. The studio work &quot;Avalanche&quot; (July 1974), for which Laing returned to play drums and David Perry became the new second guitarist (from November 1973 to September 1974), would be Mountain&#x27;s final album with Pappalardi as a participant; the group broke up again after playing a final show at Felt Forum in New York City on December 31, 1974.

On April 17, 1983 Gail Collins Pappalardi, Pappalardi&#x27;s wife and songwriting partner (she had designed many of the band&#x27;s album covers and wrote many of their lyrics), shot Pappalardi in the neck in their fifth-floor East Side Manhattan apartment and he died.

After pursuing separate musical paths for almost a decade, West and Laing reunited Mountain, recruiting Miller Anderson (ex-Savoy Brown &amp; Keef Hartley) on bass in 1981. After Anderson had travel visa troubles, he was replaced in 1984 by Mark Clarke and the group recorded &quot;Go for Your Life&quot; (March 1985). This line up played at the Knebworth Fayre on June 22, 1985 alongside Mama&#x27;s Boys, Blackfoot, Meat Loaf, Scorpions, Deep Purple, and others. &quot;Go For Your Life&quot; was dedicated to Pappalardi&#x27;s memory. Shortly thereafter, the band performed with Triumph at the Prairie Capital Convention Center in Illinois.

Mountain went dormant again until 1992, when West and Laing teamed up once again and brought in Richie Scarlet (known for his solo work and collaborations with Ace Frehley) to round out the lineup that had a live appearance in &quot;The Dennis Miller Show&quot;. Scarlet was replaced with Randy Coven in 1993 and in 1994 there was a Mountain lineup that included West, Laing, Noel Redding and occasional special guest guitarist Elvin Bishop. By 1995, the 1984–85 lineup of West, Laing and Mark Clarke was back, and recorded &quot;Man&#x27;s World&quot; in 1996. In 1998 things went quiet in the Mountain camp again until 2001. That year, with Scarlet back in the lineup, the band toured, then recorded &quot;Mystic Fire&quot;, released in 2002.

In 2003 West and Laing authored a book of recollections, &quot;Nantucket Sleighride and Other Mountain On-the-Road Stories&quot;, detailing their time with the band at its peak and their subsequent careers.

Mountain&#x27;s video game debut came in 2007 on RedOctane&#x27;s &quot;Guitar Hero III&quot;, featuring &quot;Mississippi Queen&quot; as a playable track. The song is also featured in the Harmonix video game &quot;Rock Band&quot;, although the version featured is a cover of the studio recording.

Their final album was 2007&#x27;s &quot;Masters of War&quot;, featuring twelve Bob Dylan covers and a guest appearance from Ozzy Osbourne.

The band headed out on the road during October and November 2008 on a North American tour opening for Joe Satriani, and with former Michael Schenker Group member Rev Jones on bass. A review of the San Diego House of Blues date covered the Mountain set, including &quot;Blowing in the Wind&quot; from the &quot;Masters of War&quot; album, with enthusiasm. Of the Satriani set, the reviewer was also pleased with the blues influence he felt Mountain brought to the evening, and with West joining in on a Satriani-led closing &quot;Stormy Monday&quot; and &quot;Going Down&quot; blues jam.

Fellow Long Island native Howard Stern has called Mountain one of his favourite bands and has occasionally played their music on his show. Other Mountain fans include Randy Rhoads, John McLaughlin, Johnny Ramone, Clutch, Karma to Burn, comedian Dennis Miller, and John Frusciante (the Red Hot Chili Peppers track &quot;Readymade&quot; off 2006&#x27;s &quot;Stadium Arcadium&quot; features a Mountain-influenced riff). Martin Barre, guitarist for Jethro Tull has stated in interviews that Leslie West was a direct influence on his playing.

Beastie Boys are also noted for their use of a brief sample of &quot;Mississippi Queen&quot; on the track &quot;Lookin&#x27; Down the Barrel of a Gun&quot; from their sample-heavy 1989 album, &quot;Paul&#x27;s Boutique&quot;.

Mountain continued to perform occasionally with Leslie West, Corky Laing and Rev Jones. On June 20, 2011, West had his lower right leg amputated as a result of complications from diabetes. Following the surgery, West performed and recorded under his own name; his concerts featured many Mountain songs. Corky Laing formed a new project, Corky Laing Plays Mountain, in 2015. This project included bassist/vocalist Joe Venti and guitarist/vocalist Phil Baker in 2015. For their 2016 United States tour, Laing and Venti were joined by Richie Scarlet, now on lead guitar, and Ken Sidotti on keyboards. They performed Mountain music in addition to songs by West, Bruce and Laing and Cream. And in 2017, Mark Mikel was playing bass with Chris Shutters and Richie Scarlet on guitar in the lineup. Mikel continued until touring was ceased in 2020 due to COVID-19.

Leslie West died on December 22, 2020, after suffering a heart attack. He was 75.

In 2021 Corky Laing&#x27;s Mountain resumed touring with a lineup of Laing (drums, vocals), Joe Venti (bass, vocals) and Richie Scarlet (guitar, keyboards).

<text>WNYC is an audio service brand, under the control of New York Public Radio, a non-profit organization. Radio and other audio programming is primarily provided by a pair of nonprofit, noncommercial, public radio stations: WNYC (AM) and WNYC-FM, located in New York City. Both stations are members of NPR and carry local and national news/talk programs.

WNYC reaches more than one million listeners each week and has the largest public radio audience in the United States. The WNYC stations are co-owned with Newark, New Jersey-licensed classical music outlet WQXR-FM (105.9 MHz), and all three broadcast from studios located in the Hudson Square neighborhood in lower Manhattan.

WNYC has been an early adopter of new technologies including HD radio, live audio streaming, and podcasting. RSS feeds and email newsletters link to archived audio of individual program segments. WNYC also makes some of its programming available on Sirius XM satellite radio.

==Programming==
The WNYC brand produces a mixture of podcasts and radio programs. Some programming is simulcast by WNYC (AM) and WNYC-FM, and at other times different programming airs on each station.

WNYC produces and broadcasts programming for a local audience, including news and interview shows &quot;The Brian Lehrer Show&quot; and &quot;All of It with Alison Stewart&quot;, along with a roster of nationally syndicated WNYC Studios produced including &quot;Radiolab&quot;, &quot;On the Media&quot;, and &quot;The New Yorker Radio Hour&quot;. WNYC is a leading member station of NPR, broadcasting NPR&#x27;s major daily news programs including &quot;Morning Edition&quot; and &quot;All Things Considered&quot;. WNYC also broadcasts programs from the BBC World Service and selected programs from other producers including &quot;This American Life&quot;, &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot;, and &quot;Fresh Air&quot;. The broadcasts airs on WNYC 93.9 FM and AM 820 in New York City, and also streams live over the internet. As a result, the station reaches listeners from across the country and around the globe.
WNYC-AM-FM has a local news team of approximately 60 journalists, producers, editors, and other broadcasting professionals.

WNYC and WNYC Studios programs and podcasts include:
* &quot;The Brian Lehrer Show&quot; is a two-hour weekday talk show covering local and national current events and social issues hosted by Brian Lehrer, a former anchor and reporter for NBC Radio Network. It won a Peabody Award in 2007 &quot;for facilitating reasoned conversation about critical issues and opening it up to everyone within earshot.&quot; In 2014, the show won first place in the Garden State Journalists Association Awards.
* &quot;All of It with Alison Stewart&quot; covers culture in the broadest sense – religion, food, language, music etc. In October 2019 the show launched the monthly book club &quot;Get Lit with All of It&quot;. In April 2020, as New York City neared the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the show partnered with the New York Public Library to shift the book club to a virtual monthly event.
* &quot;On the Media&quot; is a nationally syndicated, weekly one-hour program hosted by Brooke Gladstone covering the media and its effect on American culture and society. Stories also regularly cover such topics as video news releases, net neutrality, media consolidation, censorship, freedom of the press, spin, and how the media is changing with technology. It won a Peabody Award in 2004 for providing listeners &quot;an insightful journey into the inner workings and outer effects of the media.&quot;. In 2013, then co-host Brooke Gladstone won a Gracie Award for Outstanding Host. The episode &quot;Bench Press&quot;, which looked at the Supreme Court and its relationship with the media, won both a New York Press Club Award and the American Bar Association&#x27;s Silver Gavel Award in 2016. Bob Garfield co-hosted the program until 2021, when he was fired from WNYC for violating its anti-bullying policies.
* &quot;New Sounds&quot; – Since 1982, founder and host John Schaefer has devoted the program to present new and eclectic music. &quot;The New York Times&quot; hailed the program as &quot;a genre-defying radio program that has played an outsize role in [New York City&#x27;s] new music scene for nearly four decades.&quot; In early 2018, the 24-hour streaming music site NewSounds.org was launched.
* &quot;Radio Rookies&quot; – provides teenagers with the tools and training to create radio stories about themselves, their communities and their world. The show won a Peabody Award in 2005 for &quot;teaching teens the fundamentals of radio reporting and giving listeners unvarnished insights into worlds ignored and disregarded,&quot; with the awarding body calling the show &quot;ingenious.&quot; In 2017 the story &quot;Gentrification: Feeling Like an Outsider in Your Own Neighborhood&quot; won a National Edward R. Murrow Award. One of the stories from a rookie reporter, &quot;Trying to Graduate from High School at 21&quot;, won both a Regional and National Edward R. Murrow Award in 2019.
* &quot;Trump, Inc.&quot;, hosted by Peabody Award-winning journalist Andrea Bernstein and Ilya Marritz, is a joint reporting project with ProPublica about President Donald Trump, his family, and the Trump administration&#x27;s potential conflicts of interest. In 2018 the show was awarded an Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Award, the medallion for Radio Features News in the Excellence in Journalism Award Competition conducted by The Society of the Silurians, and Apple named it as one of the most popular podcasts launched that year.
* &quot;Fishko Files&quot; – Sara Fishko produces sound-rich essays on art, culture, music and media. The feature &quot;Realism and Rebellion&quot; won a Regional Edward R. Murrow Award in 2019.
* &quot;The Takeaway&quot; – a weekday one-hour news show, hosted by Melissa Harris-Perry, co-produced with Public Radio Exchange.
* &quot;Death, Sex &amp; Money&quot; – Host Anna Sale talks to celebrities and regular people about relationships, money, family, work and making it all count.
* &quot;Radiolab&quot; – two-time Peabody Award-winning podcast attempts to approach broad, difficult topics such as &quot;time&quot; and &quot;morality&quot; in an accessible and light-hearted manner and with a distinctive audio production style. Hosted by Jad Abumrad, Lulu Miller, and Latif Nasser.
* &quot;Free Shakespeare on the Radio&quot; was a co-production between WNYC Studios and The Public Theater that reimagined the Theater&#x27;s annual &quot;Free Shakespeare in the Park&quot; as a multi-episode radio play. The production was conceived after the COVID-19 pandemic prevented the annual outdoor play from taking place, the first time in nearly 60 years. The originally scheduled performance of &quot;Richard II&quot; was adapted for radio and directed by Saheem Ali. The performance was dedicated to the Black Lives Matter movement and featured a cast composed predominantly of BIPOC actors, including André Holland, Phylicia Rashad, and Lupita Nyong&#x27;o. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the cast &quot;delivered electric performances, spotlighting the aural delights of Shakespeare&#x27;s language.&quot;

==History==
===Early years===

WNYC (AM) began broadcasting in 1924. and is one of the oldest radio stations in the city. WNYC-FM began broadcasting in 1943. Both stations were originally owned by the City of New York.
===Independence from the City===
Shortly after assuming the mayoralty in 1994, Rudy Giuliani announced he was considering selling the WNYC stations. Giuliani believed that broadcasting was no longer essential as a municipal service, and that the financial compensation from selling the stations could be used to help the City cover budget shortfalls. The final decision was made in March 1995: while the City opted to divest WNYC-TV (now WPXN-TV) through a blind auction to commercial buyers, WNYC-AM-FM was sold to the WNYC Foundation for $20 million over a six-year period, far less than what the stations could have been sold for if they were placed on the open market. While the sale put an end to the occasional political intrusions of the past, it required the WNYC Foundation to embark on a major appeal towards listeners, other foundations, and private benefactors. The station&#x27;s audience and budget have continued to grow since the split from the city.

===Move to new studios===
On June 16, 2008, WNYC moved from its of rent-free space scattered on eight floors of the Manhattan Municipal Building to a new location at 160 Varick Street, near the Holland Tunnel. The station now occupies 3 floors of a 12-story former printing building in Hudson Square.

The new offices have ceilings and of space. The number of recording studios and booths has doubled, to 31. There is a new 140-seat, street-level studio for live broadcasts, concerts and public forums and an expansion of the newsroom of over 60 journalists.

Renovation, construction, rent and operating costs for the new Varick Street location amounted to $45 million. In addition to raising these funds, WNYC raised money for a one-time fund of $12.5 million to cover the cost of creating 40 more hours of new programming and three new shows. The total cost of $57.5 million for both the move and programming is nearly three times the $20 million the station had to raise over seven years to buy its licenses from the City in 1997.
