<text>Sale is a town in Trafford, Greater Manchester, England, in the historic county of Cheshire on the south bank of the River Mersey, south of Stretford, northeast of Altrincham, and southwest of Manchester. In 2021, it had a population of 54,515.

Evidence of Stone Age, Roman and Anglo-Saxon activity has previously been discovered locally. In the Middle Ages, Sale was a rural township, linked ecclesiastically with neighbouring Ashton upon Mersey, whose fields and meadows were used for crop and cattle farming. By the 17th century, Sale had a cottage industry manufacturing garthweb, the woven material from which horses&#x27; saddle girths were made.

The Bridgewater Canal reached the town in 1765, stimulating Sale&#x27;s urbanisation. The arrival of the railway in 1849 triggered Sale&#x27;s growth as an important town and place for people who wanted to travel to and from Manchester, leading to an influx of middle class residents; by the end of the 19th century, the town&#x27;s population had more than tripled. Agriculture gradually declined as service industries boomed.

Sale&#x27;s urban growth resulted in a merger with neighbouring Ashton upon Mersey, following the Local Government Act 1929. The increase in population led to the granting of a charter in 1935, giving Sale honorific borough status. Since then, Sale has continued to thrive as one of the main urban centres of Trafford due to its proximity to the M60 motorway and the connections to Manchester and other areas by the Manchester Metrolink network.

== History ==
===Founding===
A flint arrowhead discovered in Sale suggests a prehistoric human presence at the location, but there is no further evidence of activity in the area until the Roman period. A 4th-century hoard of 46 Roman coins was discovered in Ashton upon Mersey, one of four known hoards dating from that period discovered within the Mersey basin. Sale lies along the line of the Roman road which runs between the fortresses at Chester (Deva Victrix) and York (Eboracum), via the fort at Manchester (Mamucium); the present-day A56 follows the route of the road through the town. After the Roman departure from Britain in the early-5th century, Britain was invaded by the Anglo-Saxons.

Some local field and road names, and the name of Sale itself, are Anglo-Saxon in origin, which indicates the town was founded in the 7th or 8th centuries. The Old English &quot;salh&quot;, from which &quot;Sale&quot; is derived, means &quot;at the sallow tree&quot;, and Ashton upon Mersey means &quot;village or farm near the ash trees&quot;. Although the townships of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey were not mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086, that may be because only a partial survey was taken. The first recorded occurrences of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey are in 1199–1216 and 1260 respectively. The settlements were referred to as townships rather than manors, which suggests further evidence of Anglo-Saxon origins as townships were developed by the Saxons.

===Early history===

The manor of Sale was one of 30 held by William FitzNigel, a powerful 12th century baron in north Cheshire. He divided it between Thomas de Sale and Adam de Carrington, who acted as Lords of the Manor on FitzNigel&#x27;s behalf. On de Sale&#x27;s death, his land passed to his son-in-law, John Holt; de Carrington&#x27;s land passed into the ownership of Richard de Massey, a member of the Masseys who were Barons of Dunham. Sale descended through the Holt and Massey families until the 17th century, when their respective lands were sold. Sale Old Hall was built in about 1603 for James Massey, probably to replace a medieval manor house, and was one of the first buildings in northwest England to be made of brick. It was rebuilt in 1840 and demolished in 1920, but two buildings in its grounds have survived: its dovecote, now in Walkden Gardens, and its lodge, the latter now occupied by Sale Golf Club.
In 1745, Crossford Bridge – which dated back to at least 1367 – was torn down. It was one of a series of bridges crossing the River Mersey destroyed by order of the government, to slow the advance of Jacobite forces during the Jacobite rising. The Jacobites repaired the bridge upon reaching Manchester, and used it to send a small force into Sale and Altrincham. Their intention was to deceive the authorities into believing that the Jacobites were heading for Chester. The feint was successful and the main Jacobite army later marched south through Cheadle and Stockport instead.

The extension of the Bridgewater Canal to Runcorn was completed as far as Sale by 1765, and transformed the town&#x27;s economy by providing a quick and cheap route into Manchester for fresh produce. Farmers who took their wares to market in Manchester brought back night soil to fertilise the fields. Not everyone benefited from the canal however; several yeomen claimed that their crops were damaged by flooding from the Barfoot Bridge aqueduct. A 1777 map shows the village of Cross Street, on the site of the road now of the same name, divided between the townships of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey. The village was first referred to in 1586 and is believed to have originated around this time. The map also shows that Sale was spread out, mainly consisting of farmhouses around Dane Road, Fairy Lane, and Old Hall Road. Sale absorbed Cross Street as it expanded.

About of &quot;wasteland&quot; known as Sale Moor was enclosed in 1807, to be divided between the landowners in Sale. This was part of a nationwide initiative to begin cultivation of common land to lessen the food shortage caused by the Napoleonic Wars. Records of poor relief in the town start in 1808, a time when the region was in the grip of an economic depression. Poorhouses, where paupers could stay rent-free, were built in the early-19th century, reflecting the poor state of the local economy. In 1829, Samuel Brooks acquired of land in Sale – about a quarter of the township – from George Grey, 6th Earl of Stamford. The area later became known as Brooklands after the land owner.

===Development===

The Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway opened in 1849, and led to the middle classes using Sale as a commuter town, a residence away from their place of work. This resulted in Sale&#x27;s population more than tripling by the end of the 19th century. The land in Sale Moor was the cheapest in the town because the soil was poor and difficult to cultivate, which was part of the reason the area was common land until the early 19th century. However, when the railway opened, Sale Moor was close to the station and became the most expensive area in Sale. Villas were built in Sale Moor, and a few in Ashton upon Mersey as the demand for land increased. They were often decorated with stained glass or different coloured bricks in an attempt to make them &quot;mansions in miniature&quot; for the aspiring middle class.

Pressure from an increasing population led to the town being supplied with amenities such as sewers, which were built in 1875–1880; and Sale was connected to the telephone network in 1888. As in the late-19th century, the early-20th century saw a great deal of construction work in Sale. The town&#x27;s first swimming baths were built in 1914, and its first cinema, the Palace, was opened during the First World War. The end of the war in 1918 resulted in a rush of marriages, which highlighted a shortage of housing. The local councils of Sale and Ashton upon Mersey took the initiative of building council housing, and rented it to the local population at below market rates. By the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, Sale had 594 council houses. The building programme was interrupted by the start of the war. additional private housing development brought the total of inter-war houses built in Sale to around 900, including large housing estates like Woodheys Hall estate in Ashton.

Sale was never officially evacuated during the war, and even received families from evacuated areas, although it was not considered far enough from likely targets to be an official destination for evacuees. The town&#x27;s proximity to Manchester, an industrial centre directed towards the war effort, did result in a number of bombing raids. Incendiaries dropped on Sale in September 1940 caused no casualties, but did damage two houses on Norman Road. In a bombing incident the following November, four people were injured and a school was damaged; on 22 December 1940, twelve people were injured by bombs. On the night of 23 December, much of Manchester suffered heavy bombing in what became known as the Manchester Blitz. Six hundred incendiary bombs were dropped on Sale in three hours. There were no injuries, but Sale Town Hall and St Paul&#x27;s Church were severely damaged. On 3 August 1943, at 11:50 pm, a Wellington Bomber on a training exercise crashed in Walton Park in the south-west of the town. Of the six-man crew, consisting of five members of the Royal Australian Air Force and one member of the Royal Air Force, the pilot and the bomb-aimer were killed.

Sale&#x27;s shopping centre was redeveloped during the 1960s, as part of the town&#x27;s post-war regeneration. In 1973, the shopping precinct in the town centre, which had grown up in the mid-19th century, was also redeveloped and pedestrianised in an attempt to increase trade. The construction of the M63 motorway (subsequently renamed the M60) in 1972 led to the creation of Sale Water Park. To minimise the risk of flooding, the new road was built on an embankment, for which the necessary gravel was extracted from what is today an artificial lake and water-sports centre. Opportunities for leisure were increased when the old swimming baths, demolished in 1971, were replaced in 1973 by a new complex built on the same site.

== Governance ==
Historically, Sale was a township in the ancient parish of Ashton upon Mersey in the hundred of Bucklow and county of Cheshire. Throughout the Middle Ages it was governed by the Lord of the Manor. Following the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, Sale was joined with the Altrincham Poor Law Union, an inter-parish unit established to provide social security. The unit changed its name to Bucklow Poor Law Union in 1895. Sale adopted the Local Government Act 1858 in November 1866, and Sale Local Board was formed to govern the township at the beginning of 1867. Members were elected to the local board by the town&#x27;s ratepayers. A household had one vote for every £10 (£ as of ) of rateable value. Under the Local Government Act 1888 Sale became an urban district of the administrative county of Cheshire. The local board was replaced by Sale Urban District Council in 1894. The parish of Ashton upon Mersey became an urban district in 1895. In 1930, the Ashton upon Mersey UD was merged into Sale UD under a county review order.

In December 1933, Sale Urban District submitted a petition to the Privy Council in an attempt to gain a charter of incorporation. At the time, Sale UD had the largest population and highest rateable value of any urban district in the country. The petition was successful and on 21 September 1935 Sale UD was granted borough status, and became the Municipal Borough of Sale. Following the Local Government Act 1972, on 1 April 1974 the Municipal Borough of Sale was abolished. Sale became an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, a local government district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. The town&#x27;s education, town planning, waste collection, health, social care and other services are administered by Trafford Council.

For national elections, Sale was in the parliamentary constituency of Altrincham and Sale from 1945 until 1997, when it was split between Altrincham and Sale West and Wythenshawe and Sale East. The Altrincham and Sale West constituency was one of the Conservative Party&#x27;s two seats in Greater Manchester until the 2024 election. The Sale area consists of five electoral wards, which between them have 15 of the 63 seats on the council. The wards from 2023 are Ashton upon Mersey, Brooklands, Sale Central, Sale Moor, and Manor. As of the 2023 local elections, the Labour Party held twelve of the wards and the Conservative Party held nine.

== Geography ==
At (53.4246, −2.322), Sale lies respectively to the north and south of the neighbouring towns of Altrincham and Stretford, and southwest of Manchester city centre. The district of Wythenshawe is to the southeast. Sale is in the Mersey Valley, about above sea level on generally flat ground. The River Mersey, which runs just north of the town, is prone to flooding during heavy rains, so the Sale Water Park, close to the town&#x27;s northern boundary, acts as an emergency flood basin. The man-made, and thus more controllable, Bridgewater Canal runs through the centre of the town.

Sale&#x27;s local drift geology consists of sand and gravel deposited about 10,000 years ago, during the last ice age. The bedrock is Bunter sandstone in the west and Triassic waterstone in the east. United Utilities obtains the town&#x27;s drinking water from the Lake District. Sale&#x27;s climate is generally temperate, like the rest of Greater Manchester. The mean highest and lowest temperatures ( and ) are slightly above the national average, while the annual rainfall () and average hours of sunshine (1394.5 hours) are respectively above and below the national averages.

The town&#x27;s main districts are Ashton upon Mersey in the northwest, Sale Moor in the southeast, and Brooklands in the southwest. The main commercial area is Sale town centre, in the central northern area of the town, but smaller commercial centres are also found in Ashton upon Mersey and Sale Moor. Brooklands is the most densely populated area. Most of the parks, including Worthington and Walton, are in the central and southern areas, leaving Ashton upon Mersey and Sale Moor with a shortage of accessible green space.

Sale&#x27;s built environment is varied, with a mixture of modern and old buildings. Some terraces, semi-detached houses and villas, survive from the Victorian period, although many of the larger houses have been converted into flats. Many semi-detached houses survive from the 1930s, when there was a need for new housing in the town as a result of a growing population and an increasingly wealthy middle class. Interspersed with these older structures are newer housing developments, such as the estates built in Ashton upon Mersey and the east of Sale during the 1970s.

== Demography ==
As of the 2001 UK census, Sale had a population of 55,234. The 2001 population density was , with a 100 to 94.2 female-to-male ratio. Of those over 16 years old, 30.0% were single (never married), 51.3% married and 7.8% divorced. Although the proportion of divorced people was similar to that of Trafford and England, the rates of those who were single and married were significantly different from the national and Trafford averages (Trafford: 44.3% single, 35.6% married; England: 44.3% single, 34.7% married). Sale&#x27;s 24,027 households included 32.2% one-person, 37.8% married couples living together, 8.3% were co-habiting couples, and 8.5% single parents with their children, these figures were similar to those of Trafford and England. Of those aged 16–74, 22.3% had no academic qualifications, similar to that of 24.7% in all of Trafford but significantly lower than 28.9% in all of England. Sale had a much higher percentage of adults with a diploma or degree than Greater Manchester as a whole. Of Sale residents aged 16–74, 26.7% had an educational qualification such as first degree, higher degree, qualified teacher status, qualified medical doctor, qualified dentist, qualified nurse, midwife, or health visitor, compared to 20% nationwide.

Originally a working class town, there was an influx of middle class people in the mid-19th century when businessmen began using Sale as a commuter town. Since then, Sale has had a greater proportion of middle class residents than the national average. In 1931, 22.7% of Sale&#x27;s population was middle class compared with 14% in England and Wales, and by 1971, this had increased to 36.3% compared with 24% nationally. Parallel to this increase in the middle classes of Sale was the decline of the working class population. In 1931, 20.3% were working class compared with 36% in England and Wales; by 1971, this had decreased to 15.4% in Sale and 26% nationwide. The rest of the population was made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers. The change in social structure in the town was at a similar rate to that of the rest of the nation but was biased towards the middle classes, transforming Sale into the middle class town it is today.

=== Population change ===
According to the hearth tax returns of 1664, the township of Sale had a population of about 365. Parish registers show that the area experienced steady population growth during the 17th and 18th centuries, more so during the latter half of the 19th century (due to the Industrial Revolution). This later growth was less rapid than that seen in neighbouring areas such as Altrincham, Bowdon or Stretford. The increase in growth in the latter half of the 19th century also coincides with the arrival of the railway, indicative of Sale&#x27;s growth as a commuter town. A huge increase in population in 1921–1931 is accounted for by the administrative merger of Sale with Ashton upon Mersey in 1930. Steady growth thereon is evident until 1981, when the decline of industry in Trafford and the Greater Manchester area accounts for a reduction in the town&#x27;s population. This follows the general population trend for Greater Manchester, with residents relocating to new jobs.

== Economy ==

During the medieval period, most of the land was used for growing crops and raising livestock such as cattle. The produce from arable farming would have been sufficient to support the local population, but the cattle would have been sold to the ruling classes. Agriculture provided the main source of employment for Sale&#x27;s residents until the mid-19th century. Industry was slow to develop in the area, as in most of what would become Trafford. This was partly because of the reluctance of the two main land owners in the area, the Stamfords and the de Traffords, to invest. Although weaving was common in Sale during the late 17th and early 18th century, by 1851 only 4% of the population was employed in that industry.

Along with the rest of the region, Sale&#x27;s economy during the early-19th century was weak, a state of affairs which persisted until the arrival of the railway in the middle of the century. Despite the dominance of agriculture, there was a growing service industry; Sale and Ashton upon Mersey experienced a growth in numbers employed in retail and domestic services in the first half of the 19th century. By 1901, less than 20% of Sale residents were employed in agriculture. Employment was available in workhouses for those who could not find work elsewhere. Sale was part of the Altrincham Union, which ran the nearest work house in Altrincham.
The main shopping centre in Sale, Stanley Square (formerly known as &quot;the Square Shopping Centre&quot;; the name was changed in 2021), was constructed in the 1960s on the site of a former Methodist chapel. Following the Trafford Centre&#x27;s opening in 1998, it was expected that the centre would suffer, but it has since prospered. In 2003 the Square Shopping Centre underwent a £7 million refurbishment, a major part of the redevelopment of Sale&#x27;s town centre. It was sold for £40M in 2005, by which time the Square had experienced an increase in trade and demand for tenancy that had led to an increase of 70% in rental income. The town&#x27;s economy expanded to the extent that in 2007, at a time when the rest of south Manchester was oversupplied with office space, Sale&#x27;s available office and commercial space was at an all-time low because of high demand.

According to the 2001 UK census, the industry of employment of residents aged 16–74 was 18.4% property and business services, 15.9% retail and wholesale, 11.1% manufacturing, 10.9% health and social work, 9.1% education, 7.8% transport and communications, 6.1% construction, 6.3% finance, 4.5% public administration, 3.8% hotels and restaurants, 0.7% energy and water supply, 0.5% agriculture, 0.2% mining, and 4.7% other. Compared with national figures, the town had a relatively high percentage of residents working in property, business services and finance. The town had a relatively low percentage working in agriculture, public administration, and manufacturing. The census recorded the economic activity of residents aged 16–74, 2.6% students were with jobs, 3.3% students without jobs, 4.9% looking after home or family, 5.2% permanently sick or disabled, and 2.3% economically inactive for other reasons. The 2.4% unemployment rate of Sale was low compared with the national rate of 3.3%.

== Culture ==

=== Landmarks and attractions ===

Sale has three Grade II* listed buildings – two churches (St. Martin and St. John the Divine) and Ashton New Hall – and eighteen Grade II listed buildings. The cenotaph outside the town hall was designed by Ashton upon Mersey sculptor Arthur Sherwood Edwards and is a Grade II listed building. It commemorates the 400 men from Sale who died in the First World War and the 300 who died in the Second World War. The memorial consists of a statue of a mourning Saint George on top of a granite pedestal. Costing £600 (£ as of ), it was funded by public subscription and unveiled in May 1925 in front of a crowd of 10,000.

The oldest surviving building in Sale is Eyebrow Cottage. Built around 1670, it was originally a yeoman farmhouse and is one of the earliest brick buildings in the area. Its name is derived from the decorative brickwork above the windows. It was built in Cross Street, which at the time was a separate village from Sale. Of the twenty-one conservation areas in Trafford, two are in Sale: part of Church Lane, Ashton-upon-Mersey, and Brogden Grove.

A bronze bust of James Joule, the physicist who gave his name to the SI unit of energy, is in Worthington Park. Originally a tower was to have been erected in his honour, but lack of donations led to the production of the bust as a substitute; it was unveiled in 1905. Joule moved to Sale in the 1870s for his health; he died at his home at 12 Wardle Road in 1889, and is buried in Brooklands Cemetery.

The area has several parks and green spaces. Worthington Park, originally called Sale Park, was opened in 1900. It features a bandstand, gardens, play areas, and a skate ramp and is maintained by Trafford Council and The Friends of Worthington Park. Opened in 1939, Walton Park is in the southwest of the town and features a miniature railway. Sale Water Park is an artificial lake, created from a deep gravel pit left during the construction of the M60. It opened in 1980 and is a venue for water sports, fishing and bird watching. The water park is the site of the Broad Ees Dole wildlife refuge, a local nature reserve that provides a home for migrating birds. Woodheys Park, also known as Pinky Park, consists of a well-maintained pitch and putt course, grass area, a five a side football pitch and other amenities.

=== Events and venues ===

Situated next to the town hall, the Waterside Arts Centre houses a plaza, a library, the Robert Bolt Theatre, the Lauriston Gallery, and the Corridor Gallery. The centre, which was opened in 2004, regularly hosts concerts, exhibitions and other community events. Performers have included comedian Lucy Porter, Midge Ure, Fairport Convention, The Zombies and Sue Perkins. In 2004, the centre received the British Urban Regeneration Association Award for its innovative use of space and for reinvigorating Sale town centre.

Sale has a Gilbert and Sullivan society, formed in 1972, which performs at the Altrincham Garrick Playhouse. The group is directed by Alistair Donkin, a former principal comic for the D&#x27;Oyly Carte Opera Company. Members of the group have won several awards at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival. Sale Brass is a traditional brass band based in Sale, formed in about 1849 as the Stretford Temperance Band. Its first recorded performance was at the 1849 opening of the railway between Manchester and Altrincham.

=== Sport ===
The rugby union side Sale F.C. has been based in Sale since 1861 and at its present Heywood Road ground since 1905. One of the oldest rugby clubs in the world, its 1865 &quot;Minute Book&quot; is the oldest existing book containing the rules of the game. The professional Sale Sharks team was originally part of Sale F.C. but split from it in 2003. Sale Sharks now play their matches at Salford Community Stadium, although they retain the use of the Heywood Road ground for training and for the staging of home games involving their reserve team, Sale Jets. The town is also home to the Ashton upon Mersey and Trafford Metrovick rugby union clubs.

Sale Harriers Manchester Athletics Club was formed in 1911, it still has its historical home at Crossford Bridge in Sale. The site is shared with Sale United Football club and Old Alts Football Club. The club has produced successful athletes such as Olympic gold medallist Darren Campbell and Commonwealth Games gold medallist Diane Modahl, both former residents of the town.

Sale Sports Club encompasses Sale Cricket Club, Sale Hockey Club, and Sale Lawn Tennis Club. The Brooklands Sports Club is home to Brooklands Cricket Club, Brooklands Manchester University Hockey Club, and Brooklands Hulmeians Lacrosse Club. It also provides facilities for squash, tennis, and bowling.

Sale United FC plays at Crossford Bridge and was recognised as Trafford&#x27;s Sports Club of the Year in 2004. Sale Golf Club and Ashton on Mersey Golf Club have courses on the outskirts of the town, and a municipal pitch and putt is based at Woodheys Park. Trafford Rowing Club has a boathouse beside the canal. Sale Leisure Centre has badminton and squash courts, a gymnasium and three swimming pools. Walton Park Sports Centre has a sports hall for activities such as 5-a-side football. Tennis, crown-green bowls, golf putting and football facilities are available at the town&#x27;s parks. Sale Water Ski Club is based at Sale Water Park.

== Education ==

Sale&#x27;s first school was built in 1667 and was used until the first half of the 18th century. The second school in Sale was built some time in the 18th century, one of about 30 non-grammar schools founded in Cheshire around this time. By 1831, there were two private schools – with the children&#x27;s parents paying fees for their education – in Sale and one in Ashton upon Mersey. At the same time, there were also four Sunday schools in Sale and one in Ashton upon Mersey, operated by various religious denominations, including Congregationalists, Methodists, and Unitarians. The first school-chapel built in Sale as part of a school was constructed by Primitive Methodists in 1839, and still survives. The second school-chapel in the town was St Joseph&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, built in 1866, and was replaced by the current school in 1899.

Trafford maintains a selective education system assessed by the eleven plus exam. Sale has one grammar school, two comprehensives and nineteen primary schools. Sale Grammar School consists of two parts, one for 11- to 16-year-olds and 900 pupils, and the other a sixth form college with 300 students. The school was described in its 2006 Ofsted report as &quot;outstanding with an outstanding sixth form&quot;. Ashton-on-Mersey School is an academy school and part of The Dean Trust. It has 1,300 pupils aged 11–16 and 120 students in its sixth form. In its 2019 Ofsted report it was rated &quot;outstanding&quot; for its 16-19 provision and &quot;good&quot; overall. https://files.api.ofsted.gov.uk/v1/file/50055567 Sale High School, formerly Jeff Joseph Sale Moor Technology College, is a foundation secondary modern school for 11- to 16-year-olds and specialist technology college. It has 1,000 pupils and in its 2006 Ofsted report was rated as &quot;satisfactory&quot;. Manor Academy provides secondary education to pupils with special needs. It has 140 students aged 11–16 and 20 members of its sixth form and was rated as &quot;good&quot; in its 2007 Ofsted report.

Sale is a leader within Trafford Council in the area of Childcare and Early education as well. Sale has a broad range of options such as after-school care, breakfast clubs, childminders, day nurseries, holiday schemes, independent school nurseries, pre-school playgroups, school nurseries. In all the areas within Trafford, Sale provides most variety and has maximum number of options in every area. In areas of After School Care, Breakfast Club, Childminder, Holiday Schemes all the providers rated by Ofsted/CQC are either Good or Outstanding. In areas of Day Nurseries (where one is rated Inadequate), Pre-School Groups (where two are rated requires improvement), School Nurseries (where one is rated Requires Improvement) most of the providers who are rated by Ofsted/CQC are again Good/Outstanding. Apart from these Sale also provides one of three Independent School Nursery in Trafford. Sale also provides a lot of options for support for childcare providers in form of advisory forums and childcare training.

== Religion ==
Sale is a diverse community with a synagogue and Christian churches of various denominations. The church buildings were mostly constructed in the late 19th or early 20th century in the wake of the population boom created by the arrival of the railway in 1849, although records show that the Church of St Martin in Ashton upon Mersey dates back to at least 1304. Before the English Reformation, the inhabitants of Sale were predominantly Catholic, but afterwards were members of the Church of England. Roman Catholics returned to the area in the 19th century in the form of Irish immigrants. Two of the three Grade II* listed buildings in the town are churches. The Church of St Martin, which was probably originally an early 14th-century timber framed structure, was rebuilt in 1714 after the church had been destroyed in a storm. The Church of St John the Divine was built in 1868, to the design of Alfred Waterhouse. There are three Grade II listed churches in Sale: the Church of St Anne; the Church of St Mary Magdalene; and the Church of St Paul.

As of the 2001 UK census, 78.0% of Sale residents reported themselves as Christian, 1.4% Muslim, 0.7% Hindu, 0.6% Jewish, 0.2% Buddhist and 0.2% Sikh. A further 12.9% had no religion, 0.2% had an alternative religion, and 5.9% did not state their religion. Sale is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Shrewsbury, and the Church of England Diocese of Chester. Sale and District Synagogue is part of United Synagogue under the aegis of the Chief Rabbi of Britain, Jonathan Sacks. The only mosque in Trafford is the Masjid-E-Noor in Old Trafford, away.

== Transport ==
The Metrolink system connects Sale with other locations in Greater Manchester. Trams depart the town&#x27;s three stations, including Sale station, least every 12 minutes between 07:00 and 22:30 daily.

The nearest railway station is Navigation Road in Altrincham, from where trains run between Manchester Piccadilly, Stockport and Chester. Services run generally hourly on this line and are provided by Northern Trains.

Franchised Bee Network bus routes provide services to Manchester and to Altrincham.

The A56 road runs between Chester and North Yorkshire via Sale, Manchester and Burnley. The M60 motorway, which encircles Manchester, can be accessed via junction 7, just to the north of Sale. The M56, which links Manchester with Chester, and the M62 motorway, between Liverpool to Hull, are about away. The M6, which runs between Catthorpe Interchange in Leicestershire and Gretna, passes about to the west.

Manchester Airport, the busiest airport in the UK outside the London area, is located to the south.

===History of transport in Sale===
The first turnpike road in the area was the latter-day A56 Chester Road between Manchester and Crossford Bridge (on the border between Sale and Stretford). Turnpike trusts collected tolls from road users and used the proceeds to maintain the highway. There was a toll booth on the Sale side of Crossford Bridge. Another section of road between Altrincham and Crossford Bridge was turnpiked in 1765.

The commencement of &quot;swift packet&quot; services on the newly opened Bridgewater Canal in 1776 made commuting from Sale into Manchester both practical and convenient, with boats travelling at a relatively swift . However, the arrival of the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway in 1849 sounded a death-knell for both the canal packet services and turnpike trusts. Many trusts went into terminal decline, mirroring a national trend.

By 1888, almost all roads and highways were the responsibility of the local authority. Sale&#x27;s railway station, originally named &quot;Sale Moor&quot;, was renamed to Sale in 1856. Three years later, Brooklands railway station was opened, followed in 1931 by the opening of Dane Road railway station along with the electrification of the entire line. The line was renovated in the early 1990s and is now part of the Metrolink.

Following the completion of a tramway between Manchester and Stretford in 1901, the British Electric Traction Company applied to Parliament for an extension to Sale. The proposal was amended to continue the line further south, into Altrincham. The line through Sale was owned by Sale Urban District Council and leased to the Manchester Corporation. Services to Sale commenced in 1907. A branch along Northenden Road from the line to Sale Moor was created in 1912. Sale Moor&#x27;s line had only a single track which, in 1925, resulted in a head-on collision between two tramcars, injuring eight passengers.

Bus services were first introduced to the area in the 1920s, but became more widespread in the 1930s. The buses did not suffer the drawback of being limited to tracks and were therefore more practical than the tram services which, from the 1930s, went into decline. The tramlines along Northenden Road were removed between 1932 and 1934, and throughout Sale in the 1940s.

<doc id="367158" wikidata="Q394327" url="?curid=367158" title="Breeding back">
<text>Breeding back is a form of artificial selection by the deliberate selective breeding of domestic (but not exclusively) animals, in an attempt to achieve an animal breed with a phenotype that resembles a wild type ancestor, usually one that has gone extinct. Breeding back is not to be confused with dedomestication.

Though bred-back breeds may be very similar to the extinct wild type in phenotype, ecological niche, and to some extent genetics, the gene pool of that wild type was different prior to its extinction. Even the superficial authenticity of a bred-back animal depends on the particular stock used to breed the new lineage. As a result of this, some breeds, like Heck cattle, are at best a vague look-alike of the extinct wild type aurochs, according to the literature.

== Background ==

The aim of breeding back programs is to restore the wild traits which may have been unintentionally preserved in the lineages of domesticated animals. Commonly, not only the new animal&#x27;s phenotype, but also its ecological capacity, are considered in back-breeding projects, as hardy, &quot;bred back&quot; animals may be used in certain conservation projects. In nature, usually only individuals well suited to their natural circumstances will survive and reproduce, whereas humans select animals with additional attractive, docile or productive characteristics, protecting them from the dangers once found in their ancestral environment (predation, drought, disease, extremes of weather, lack of mating opportunities, etc.). In such cases, selection criteria in nature differ from those found in domesticated conditions. Because of this, domesticated animals often differ significantly in phenotype, behaviour and genetics from their wild forerunners. It is the hope of breeding-back programs to re-express, within a new breeding lineage, the wild, ancient traits that may have &quot;lain buried&quot; in the DNA of domestic animals.

In many cases, the extinct wild type ancestors of a given species are known only through skeletons and, in some cases, historical descriptions, making their phenotype poorly understood. Given that situation, there is currently no certainty of achieving success with a back-breeding attempt, and any results must be reviewed with great caution. In order to test genetic closeness, DNA (both mitochondrial and nuclear) of the breeding animals must be compared against that of the extinct animal.

Successful breeding back might be possible: humans have selected animals only for superficial traits, and as a rule did not intentionally change less-observable traits, such as metabolic biochemistry. Further, since many domestic species show behaviours derived from their wild ancestors (such as the herding instinct of cattle or the social instincts of dogs), and are fit to survive outside the sphere of human interference (as evidenced by the many feral populations of various domestic animals), it can be presumed that &quot;bred back&quot; animals might be able to function like their wild ancestors. For example, food preferences are assumed to be largely the same in domesticated animals as in their wild type ancestors.

Natural selection might serve as an additional tool in creating &quot;authentic&quot; robustness, &quot;authentic&quot; behaviour, and perhaps, the original phenotype as well. In some cases, a sufficient predator population would be necessary to enable such a selection process; in today&#x27;s Europe, where many breeding-back attempts take place, this predator population is largely absent.

== Use ==

Bred-back breeds are desirable in conservation biology, as they may fill an ecological gap left open by the extinction of a wild type due to human activities. As long as food preference, behaviour, robustness, defence against predators, hunting or foraging instincts and phenotype are the same as in the wild type, the bred-back phenotype will function similarly in the ecosystem. Releasing such animals into the wild would re-fill the previously empty niche, and allow a natural dynamic among the various species of the ecosystem to re-establish. However, not all breeding-back attempts will result in an animal that is closer to the wild type than are primitive domestic breeds. For example, Heck cattle bear less resemblance to the aurochs than do many Iberian fighting cattle.

== Examples==

=== Aurochs ===

Ideas for creating an aurochs-like animal from domestic cattle have been around since 1835. In the 1920s, Heinz and Lutz Heck tried to breed an aurochs look-alike, using central European dairy breeds and southern European cattle. The result, Heck cattle, are hardy, but differ from the aurochs in many respects, although a resemblance in colour and, less reliably, horns has been achieved. From 1996 onwards, Heck cattle have been crossed with &quot;primitive&quot; Iberian breeds like Sayaguesa Cattle and fighting cattle, as well as the very large Italian breed Chianina, in a number of German reserves, in order to enhance the resemblance to the aurochs. The results are called Taurus cattle, being larger and longer-legged than Heck cattle and having more aurochs-like horns. Another of the projects to achieve a type of cattle that resembles the aurochs is the TaurOs Project, using primitive, hardy southern European breeds, specifically Limia, Maremmana primitivo, Maronesa, Podolica, Sayaguesa and Pajuna.

=== European wild horse ===

The Polish Konik horse is often erroneously considered the result of a breeding-back experiment to &quot;recreate&quot; the phenotype of the Tarpan. The Konik is actually a hardy landrace breed originating in Poland, which was called &quot;Panje horse&quot; before agriculturist Tadeusz Vetulani coined the name &quot;Konik&quot; in the 1920s. Vetulani started an experiment to reconstruct the Tarpan using Koniks; ultimately, his stock made only a minor contribution to the present-day Konik population.

During the Second World War, the Heck brothers crossed Koniks with Przewalski&#x27;s horses and ponies, such as the Icelandic horse and the Gotland pony; the result is now called the Heck Horse. During recent decades, Heck horses have been continually crossed with Koniks, making the two phenotypes at present nearly indistinguishable, excepting that the Heck horse tends to have a lighter build.

=== Pigs ===
Boar–pig hybrids, which are hybrids of wild boars and domestic pigs and exist as an invasive species throughout Eurasia, the Americas, Australia, and in other places where European settlers imported wild boars to use as game animals, are also used for selective breeding to re-create the type of pigs represented in prehistoric artworks dating from the Iron Age and earlier in ancient Europe. A project to create them, under the name of the Iron Age pig, started in the early 1980s by crossing a male wild boar with a Tamworth sow to produce an animal resembling what Iron Age pigs are believed to have looked like. Iron Age pigs are generally only raised in Europe for the specialty meat market, and in keeping with their heritage are generally more aggressive and harder to handle than purebred domesticated pigs.

=== Quagga ===
The Quagga Project is an attempt, based in South Africa, to breed animals which strongly resemble the now-extinct quagga, a subspecies of the plains zebra which died out in 1883. Accordingly, the project is limited to selecting for the physical appearance of the original, as recorded by twenty-three mounted specimens, many contemporary illustrations, and a number of written accounts of the animals.

The two most noticeable characteristics of the quagga, fewer stripes and a darker pelage, are frequently observed to varying degrees in wild plains zebra populations. Animals with these two traits have been sought out for the Quagga Project breeding programme. In its fourth breeding , the Quagga Project has resulted in foals displaying faint to absent striping on the hind legs and body, although the brown background color of the extinct quagga has yet to emerge. The project refers to their animals as &quot;Rau quaggas&quot;, after the project founder Reinhold Rau.

The project has been criticized for its focus on the morphological characteristics of the quagga, as the extinct animal may have possessed unrecorded behavioral or non-visible traits that would be impossible to reliably breed back from plains zebras.

=== Wolf ===

Although the wolf, the wild ancestor of domestic dogs, is not extinct, its phenotype is the target of several developmental breeds including the Northern Inuit Dog and the Tamaskan Dog. They are all crossbreeds of German Shepherds, Alaskan Malamutes, and Huskies; selected for phenotypic wolf characteristics, the hybrids are then backbred to improve the &quot;look-alike&quot; effect. These new breeds may be viewed as breeding-back attempts as well.

The Dire Wolf Project, started in 1988, aims to bring back the look of the extinct prehistoric dire wolf by breeding different domestic dog breeds that resemble it. Like the Quagga Project, these animals only resemble the extinct species physically and not genetically or mentally.

=== Galápagos giant tortoise ===

In 2012, several hybrids of the Volcán Wolf and extinct Floreana giant tortoise subspecies were discovered on Isabela Island in the Galápagos Archipelago, a territory of Ecuador. It is believed that sailors left these tortoises on the island during their travels in the early 19th century. In 2017, back breeding efforts began to help the hybrids regain genetic purity of the Floreana subspecies. By 2023, 400 Floreana offspring have been hatched from these hybrids on Santa Cruz Island, with plans to release these back bred animals into the wilds of Floreana Island to regain their niche following the successful extirpation of invasive species.

<doc id="367159" wikidata="Q809550" url="?curid=367159" title="Barton-upon-Humber">
<text>Barton-upon-Humber () or Barton is a town and civil parish in North Lincolnshire, England. The population at the 2011 census was 11,066. It is situated on the south bank of the Humber Estuary at the southern end of the Humber Bridge. It is south-west of Kingston upon Hull and north north-east of the county town of Lincoln. Other nearby towns include Scunthorpe to the south-west and Grimsby to the south-east.

==Geography==
Barton is on the south bank of the Humber Estuary and is at the southern end of the Humber Bridge. The Viking Way starts near the bridge.

===Transport connections===
The Barton – Cleethorpes Branch Line (opened 1849) via Grimsby terminates at Barton-on-Humber railway station. The A15 passes to the west of the town cutting through &quot;Beacon Hill&quot;, and has a junction with the A1077 &quot;Ferriby Road&quot; to South Ferriby. The B1218 passes north–south through the town, and leads to Barton Waterside. Bus services provided by Stagecoach in Lincolnshire and East Yorkshire link the town with Cleethorpes, Grimsby, Scunthorpe and Hull.

==History==

===Prehistoric===
Cropmarks and the discovery of polished handaxes in the area surrounding Barton-upon-Humber suggest that the area was inhabited at least as far back as the Neolithic (circa 4000 to circa 2,500 BCE).

===Roman===
No Roman settlement has been found in Barton-upon-Humber, though individual discoveries dating to the Roman period have been made: in 1828 a Roman cremation and an inhumation were discovered, in 1967 part of a Roman road was excavated near Bereton school (now Baysgarth school), and other finds of coins, potteries, querns, and other Roman objects have been made. The Deepdale Hoard was discovered in the vicinity in 1979.

===Anglo-Saxon===
An Anglo-Saxon inhumation cemetery was discovered at Castledyke South during the construction of air raid shelters in 1939. The cemetery, believed to have been in use from the late 5th or early 6th century until the late 7th century, was investigated and partially excavated during 1975 to 1990. The skeletal remains of 227 individuals were identified, including one who had undergone (and survived) trepanning. 

The Castledyke South area has been suggested to be the site of the Battle of Brunanburh (AD 937), one of the most defining battles in the history of the British Isles. Historical sources tell of a huge fleet of warships entering the Humber led by Olaf Guthfrithsson. Olaf and a coalition force were overwhelmed in battle by King Æthelstan and his army, after which the defeated warriors and their leaders were said to have escaped in their ships.

===Medieval===
Barton is mentioned as a medieval borough in documents dating from 1086, 1216–1272 and 1298. A ferry to Hull was first recorded in 1086. The oldest residential building in Barton is 51 Fleetgate: it dates back to 1325 with the majority of the front of the building dating to 1425. The Medieval manor in Barton was Tyrwhitt Hall which dates to at least the 15th century.

===Churches===
There are two medieval churches extant in Barton-upon-Humber, St Peter&#x27;s and St Mary&#x27;s, located only about 170 yards apart. 

St Peter&#x27;s is a large, mostly Anglo-Saxon church. The Church of England made it redundant in 1972, after which the remains of some 2,750 people were removed. The significance of the human remains lies in their representing the pathology of an isolated community over the period ca. 950-ca. 1850. The church was reopened in May 2007 as a resource for medical research into the development of diseases and ossuary practices. An excavation report on this, one of England&#x27;s most extensively investigated parish churches, was published in 2007.

St. Peter&#x27;s predates St. Mary&#x27;s, which may have originated as a chapel on the original market place. St. Mary&#x27;s was enlarged and increased in importance as the town&#x27;s trade thrived in the 12th and 13th centuries.

===18th century===
*William Hall&#x27;s Barton Ropery opens in 1767.

==Education==
Baysgarth School, on Barrow Road, is a comprehensive school for ages 11–18. There are also three primary schools: St Peter&#x27;s Church of England, on Marsh Lane; the Castledyke Primary School (formerly Barton County School), on the B1218; and Bowmandale Primary School, in the south of the town.

Barton Grammar School, which opened in 1931, used to be on Caistor Road. Henry Treece, the poet and author, was a teacher at the grammar school.

==Industry==
The clay pits on the Humber foreshore were the focus of a tile and cement industry from 1850 to 1959. The industrial sites were abandoned in the early 20th century once supplies of clay began to run out. The clay workings filled with water and became colonised by species of reeds. The reserve was acquired by Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust in 1983, who opened it as Far Ings National Nature Reserve in the same year.

For 20 years, Barton-upon-Humber was home to a site for Kimberly-Clark. The site closed in March 2013 and more than 200 jobs were lost. Wren Kitchens bought the site and moved to a new head office, &#x27;The Nest&#x27;, on the site, initially employing 429 people. Wren extended the site in 2016, creating an additional 600 jobs. In 2019 Wren announced successful plans to build a £120million extension to the site. The new site was expected to employ an additional 535 people.

==Culture==

===Events===
An annual &#x27;Bike night&#x27;, a social event in the town celebrating motorcycles, has been held since 1997. An annual arts festival has been held in Barton-upon-Humber since 1998.

Since 1981, there has been a local history museum based in Baysgarth House, within Baysgarth Park. In 2009, the Wilderspin National School museum opened following a £1.9 million funding investment. The school focuses on the life and works of Samuel Wilderspin. In September 2020 an archive and exhibition centre dedicated to Ted Lewis was opened on Ferriby Road.

===Public Houses===
Barton-upon-Humber has at least seven extant public houses, including The Volunteer Arms, The George Hotel, and The Wheatsheaf. At least thirteen former public houses have been recorded from Barton, including the Steam Packet (on Fleetgate) which was demolished in 1848 in advance of the new railway here, and the Whitecross Tavern which closed in 1926. Former pubs which have recently closed and since been redeveloped include The Blue Bell, which was redeveloped in 2016 into a housing complex named Blue Bell Court, and the Carnival Inn, which was demolished in 2013.

<text>Buckfastleigh is a market town and civil parish in Devon, England situated beside the Devon Expressway (A38) at the edge of the Dartmoor National Park. It is part of Teignbridge and, for ecclesiastical purposes, lies within the Totnes Deanery. It is 18 miles (29 km) east-northeast of Plymouth, 20 miles (32 km) southwest of Exeter and has a population of 3,661. It is a centre of tourism and is home to Buckfast Abbey, the South Devon Railway, the Buckfastleigh Butterfly Farm and Otter Sanctuary, the Tomb of Squire Richard Cabell and The Valiant Soldier Museum Heritage &amp; Visitor Centre 
http://valiantsoldier.org.uk/
With 13 letters, Buckfastleigh is one of the longest place names in England with no repeated letters, tied with Buslingthorpe, Leeds and Buslingthorpe, Lincolnshire, but exceeded by Bricklehampton in Worcestershire with 14 letters.

==Geography==
Geographically, Buckfastleigh straddles the confluence of two small streams from Dartmoor which feed into the River Dart just to the east of the town. About one mile to the north lies Buckfast, home of Buckfast Abbey. To the northwest lie Holne and Scorriton on the southern breastwork of the Dartmoor upland. Pridhamsleigh Cavern is nearby and is neighboured by Ashburton and Lower Dean.

==History==
Historically Buckfastleigh has grown as a mill town known for its woollen mills, corn and paper mills and a tannery supported by the rivers Dart, Mardle and the Dean Burn – water being an essential natural resource used in the manufacturing of wool and other products.

Buckfastleigh is medieval in origin, as is still evident in the original layout of the town. By the seventeenth century, most of the properties had been rebuilt, but the medieval layout, particularly in Fore Street, is still visible today.

The name &quot;Buckfast&quot; means &quot;stronghold&quot; – traditionally a place where deer and buck were held, and &quot;Leigh&quot; would have been the pasture belonging to Buckfast – hence the meaning deer held in a pasture (buck-fast-leigh).

Buckfast probably existed before Buckfastleigh as it is mentioned in the Domesday Book and in 1018 a Benedictine Abbey was founded and endorsed by King Canute at Buckfast.

Buckfastleigh town centre is now an area of mostly late eighteenth- to early twentieth-century buildings with an interesting collection of private dwellings, commercial and retail properties and public houses which retain many, if not all, of their original features, styles and character.

The town centre during the first half of the twentieth century was a lively almost self-sufficient community with locally based employment and a large building programme of local authority housing initiated by Buckfastleigh Urban District Council which commenced in the 1920s and extended the town to the south west and the north west. Census data shows that in 1801 the population was 1,525, and 2,781 in 1901.

The Hamlyn family were the owners of the largest of the woollen mills in the town. In 1880 the Hamlyn family built Bossell - a large country house with 8 acres of land - as their family home in the town. The Hamlyn family monogram still adorns the front of the house. In 1887 they were instrumental in the building Buckfastleigh Town Hall to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. 

Land was also made available at this time for further public facilities which included Victoria Park, the tennis courts and the swimming pool. The new primary school was built in 1875, while the railway line from Buckfastleigh and Ashburton to Totnes had been opened in 1872 (it lost its passenger trains in 1958; and the goods service in 1962). Links to Ashburton and Totnes are maintained by Country Bus service 88 and which continues to Newton Abbot. 

Pennywell Farm is an organic farm and tourist attraction just outside the town.

==Brook manor house and Sherlock Holmes==
To the west of the town is the manor house of Brook, a grade II* listed building, built in 1656 by Richard Cabell (d. 1677), lord of the manor of Brook. He was the subject of a local legend which relates that on the night of his death, black hounds breathing fire and smoke raced over Dartmoor and surrounded Brook House, howling. Cabell&#x27;s unusual tomb was allegedly designed to keep his restless spirit from roaming Dartmoor. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle based his Sherlock Holmes novel &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; (1901–1902) on this legend. The story&#x27;s description of Baskerville Hall, however, is based on Cromer Hall in Norfolk.

==South Devon Railway Trust==
The South Devon Railway Trust is a charitable organisation that operates a heritage railway from Totnes to Buckfastleigh in Devon, alongside the River Dart. The heritage railway itself is known as the South Devon Railway, named in honour of the South Devon Railway Company that originally built much of Devon&#x27;s railway infrastructure, although its previous name of the Dart Valley Railway is sometimes still heard.

The line was built by the Buckfastleigh, Totnes and South Devon Railway and first opened on 1 May 1872. Originally the line connected Totnes with Ashburton but in recent years the line passing between Buckfastleigh and Ashburton was demolished to make way for the A38 expressway. The line was worked by the larger South Devon Railway Company until 1 February 1876 when this was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway.

Vintage steam locomotives and carriages in the tradition of a bygone age are used; it offers unique scenery only seen from the railway. The South Devon Railway has an interesting collection of both steam and diesel locomotives. There are many former Great Western engines and industrial locomotives, the South Devon Railway Trust work with National Railway Museum.

==Buckfast Abbey==
Buckfast Abbey was founded by Earl Aylward in the reign of King Canute in 1018. In 1147 it became a Cistercian abbey and was rebuilt in stone. In medieval times, the abbey became rich through fishing and trading in sheep wool, although the Black Death killed two abbots and many monks – by 1377 there were only fourteen monks at Buckfast.

On 25 February 1539, William Petre arrived at Buckfast and declared the abbey to be dissolved by the order of King Henry VIII. The Dissolution of the Monasteries left monks compelled to leave and the buildings were looted and then destroyed. The abbey then stood in ruins for over two hundred years.

On 28 October 1882, six Benedictine monks arrived at Buckfast having been exiled from France. The land had been leased by monks from the St. Augustine&#x27;s Priory in Ramsgate and it was later bought for £4,700. The first new abbot was Boniface Natter, who died in a shipwreck in 1906. His travelling companion Anscar Vonier became the next abbot and pledged to fulfil his dying wish, namely to rebuild the abbey.

==Buckfastleigh Rangers Football and Social Club==
Buckfastleigh Rangers is a Football and Social Club based in Buckfastleigh, Devon. They were established in 1903, playing in the South Devon League. During recent years Rangers has enjoyed league promotion and cup success. The teams have won the Lidstone, Greenaway, Harry Treeby and the Devon Senior Cups. Over the years Buckfastleigh Rangers Football Club have played hosts to other league clubs including Torquay United, Plymouth Argyle, Watford F.C and Leyton Orient.

==From Buckfastleigh==
Through the ages several residents of Buckfastleigh families have earned a place in history, scholarship or commerce. One such person is Professor William Hosking, who became, in 1840, the first Professor of Architecture at King&#x27;s College in London.

The curly-coated Devon Rex cat breed was first discovered in Buckfastleigh in the 1960s and is named after the county in which the town is situated.

==Caves==
Caves in Buckfastleigh include:
* Bakers Pit
* Joint Mitnor Cave (containing unfossilised remains of bison, hippopotamus, hyaena, elephant and others)
* Reed&#x27;s Cave

<text>Sutton Coldfield or the Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield ( ), is a town and civil parish in the city of Birmingham, West Midlands, England. The town lies around 8 miles northeast of Birmingham city centre, 9 miles south of Lichfield, 7 miles southwest of Tamworth, and 7 miles east of Walsall.

Sutton Coldfield and its surrounding suburbs are governed under Birmingham City Council for local government purposes but the town has its own town council which governs the town and its surrounding areas by running local services and electing a mayor to the council. It is in the historic county of Warwickshire, and in 1974 it became part of Birmingham and the West Midlands metropolitan county under the Local Government Act 1972.

== History ==
=== Etymology ===
The etymology of the name Sutton appears to be from &quot;South Town&quot;.
The name &quot;Sutton Coldfield&quot; appears to come from this time, being the &quot;south town&quot; (i.e. south of Tamworth and/or Lichfield) on the edge of the &quot;col field&quot;. &quot;Col&quot; is usually derived from &quot;charcoal&quot;, charcoal burners presumably being active in the area. 

=== Prehistory ===
The earliest known signs of human presence in Sutton Coldfield were discovered in 2002–2003 on the boundaries of the town. Archaeological surveys undertaken in preparation for the construction of the M6 Toll road revealed evidence of Bronze Age burnt mounds near Langley Mill Farm, at Langley Brook. Additionally, evidence for a Bronze Age burial mound was discovered, one of only two in Birmingham with the other being located in Kingstanding. Excavations also uncovered the presence of an Iron Age settlement, dating to around 400 and 100 BC, consisting of circular houses built over at least three phases surrounded by ditches. Closer to Langley Brook (a tributary of the River Tame), excavations uncovered the remains of a single circular house surrounded by ditches, dating from the same period.

Near to Langley Mill Farm is Fox Hollies, where archaeological surveys have uncovered flints dating from the New Stone Age. Amongst the finds in the area were flint cores and a flint scraper, which had been retouched with a knife. The presence of flint cores suggest that the site was used for tool manufacture and that a settlement was nearby. Additionally, a Bronze Age burnt mound was also discovered in the area.

In his &quot;History of Birmingham&quot;, published in 1782, William Hutton describes the presence of three mounds adjacent to Chester Road on the extremities of Sutton Coldfield (although now outside the modern boundaries of the town). The site, southwest of Bourne Pool (named &quot;Bowen Pool&quot; by Hutton), is called Loaches Banks and was mapped as early as 1752 by Dr. Wilks of Willenhall. Hutton interpreted the earthworks as a Saxon fortification but further archaeological work led Dr. Mike Hodder, now the Planning Archaeologist for Birmingham City Council, to believe that the site was an Iron Age hill-slope enclosure. Centuries of agriculture on the land has severely affected the visibility of the features, with the earthworks now only apparent in aerial photography.

Further evidence of pre-Roman human habitation are preserved in Sutton Park. A major fire in the park in 1926 revealed six more mounds near Streetly Lane, excavations of which uncovered charred and cracked stones within them and pits below the two largest mounds. Although their date of origin is unknown, claims they were of Bronze Age origin were disproved. The mounds are now covered in rough heathland. The area around Rowton&#x27;s Well has been the source of many archaeological discoveries such as flint tools, and in the 18th century, worked timbers were discovered near the well, suggesting a possible Iron Age timber trackway built across wet land, similar to others discovered elsewhere in the country. A burnt mound was also discovered in New Hall Valley.

=== Roman period ===
The presence of Romans in the area is most visible in Sutton Park, where a long preserved section of Icknield Street passes through. Whilst the road ultimately connects Gloucestershire to South Yorkshire, locally, the road was important for connecting Metchley Fort in Edgbaston with Letocetum, now Wall, in Staffordshire. The road is most visible from near to the pedestrian gate on Thornhill Road (OS Grid Reference ), where the wide bank that formed the road surface is most prominent. Excavations at the road have showed that it was made from compacted gravel, never having a paved surface. Along each side are intermittent ditches, marked by Roman engineers, and beyond these are hollows where gravel was excavated to make the road surface. At least three Roman coins have been found along the course of Icknield Street through Sutton Park, as well as a Roman pottery kiln elsewhere in the town.

Next to the Iron Age property at Langley Brook, the remains of a timber building and field system were discovered. Pottery recovered from this site was dated to the second and third century, indicating the presence of a Roman farmstead.

=== Anglo-Saxon establishment, c. 600–1135 ===
Upon the Roman withdrawal from Britain to protect the Roman Empire on the continent in the fifth century, the area of Sutton Coldfield, still undeveloped, passed into the Anglo Saxon kingdom of Mercia. It is during this period that it is believed Sutton Coldfield may have originated as a hamlet, as a hunting lodge was built at Maney Hill for the purpose of the Mercian leaders. The outline of the deer park that it served is still visible within Sutton Park, with the ditch and bank boundary forming the western boundary of Holly Hurst, then crossing Keepers Valley, through the Lower Nuthurst and continuing on south of Blackroot Pool. Due to the marshy ground at Blackroot Valley, a fence was probably constructed to contain the deer, and the ditch and bank boundary commence again on the eastern side, on towards Holly Knoll.

This became known as Southun or Sutton; &quot;ton&quot; meaning the town stead to the south of Tamworth, the capital of Mercia. Middleton is situated between the two. &quot;Coldfield&quot; denotes an area of land on the side of hill that is exposed to the weather.

Sutone, as the manor became known, was held by Edwin, Earl of Mercia, during the reign of Edward the Confessor. Upon the death of Edwin in 1071, the manor and the rest of Mercia passed into the possession of the Crown, then ruled by William the Conqueror, resulting in Sutton Chase becoming a royal forest.

The manor of Sutone was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it was rated at eight hides, making it larger than all surrounding villages in terms of cultivated land.

=== Early development, c. 1135–1499 ===
==== Possession of the manor ====
The manor remained in the possession of the Crown until 1135, when King Henry I exchanged it for the manors of Hockham and Langham in Rutland, with Roger de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Warwick. The manor remained in the possession of the earldom of Warwick for around 300 years, with numerous exceptions. As Sutton Forest was no longer in the possession of the Crown, it became Sutton Chase.

In 1242, when the manor was passed to Ela Longespee, the widow of Thomas de Beaumont, 6th Earl of Warwick, it was named as Sutton-in-Coldfield, and again noted as such in 1265 when Ela married her second husband Philip Basset. The manor of Sutton-in-Coldfield was once again in the possession of the earldom of Warwick when Ela exchanged it with William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick, for the manor of Spilsbury in Oxfordshire. The first mention of a manor house attached to the manor of Sutton was mentioned in 1315 on a site named Manor Hill, west of the parish church.

During the 15th century, Sutton Coldfield underwent a process of change due in part to the turbulent ongoings with the Earls of Warwick and their possession of the manor house. In 1397, Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick, was punished by King Richard II for being a member of the Lords Appellant. All his possessions were confiscated, including the land at Sutton, which was transferred to Thomas Holland, 3rd Earl of Kent. Upon King Richard II&#x27;s death in 1400, Thomas de Beauchamp was returned his possessions, although he died the following year. In 1446, Henry de Beauchamp, 14th Earl of Warwick, died and the earldom was passed to his two-year-old daughter Anne; however, King Henry VI collected the profits of the land whilst Anne was in her infancy. Anne died in 1448, and the estate and earldom passed to her aunt Anne Neville, although this was contested by her three older half-sisters. In his &quot;Itinerary&quot;, John Leland mentions that Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, and his wife, Anne Neville, are believed to have built a new manor of timber-frame construction, with a lease given by King Henry VI in 1460 to Edward Mountfort, suggesting that the manor was then occupied by the Mountfort family.

Despite being occupied by Mountfort family, Richard Neville regained his power and land, but was killed at the Battle of Barnet in 1471. Normally, the land would have remained in the possession of his wife, but instead they were given to his two daughters and their husbands. However, the eldest daughter, Isabella, contested and obtained the remainder of the interests from her sister. Isabella died in 1476, leaving the manor in the possession of her husband, George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence. However, in 1478, he was attainted and executed, meaning that the manor was passed to his only surviving son, Edward Plantagenet, who was still an infant. The Crown held the lands due to Edward&#x27;s age, but in 1487 granted the lands back to Anne Neville, 16th Countess of Warwick, since both of her daughters were now dead. She immediately gave the lands back; however, Sutton and other manors were given back to her in 1489. She died in 1492, with all the land returning to the possession of the Crown, with whom it remained until it was incorporated in 1528.

==== Growth and military influence ====
The manor of Sutton was not the only manor house within Sutton, as the manor of Langley was noted as being in the possession of the de Bereford family of Wishaw as early as the mid-13th century. New Hall Manor is said to date to the 13th century also, and was mentioned in 1327 as being passed from William de Sutton to Robert de Sutton. It is believed to have originally been a hunting lodge. In 1281, Peddimore Hall was first mentioned when it was sold to Hugh de Vienna by Thomas de Arden. It is presumed that the land was given to the Arden family by one of the Earls of Warwick.

It is not known exactly when the village of Sutton began to develop but in 1300, Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick, was granted a charter by King Edward I to hold a market on each Tuesday and an annual fair on the eve of Holy Trinity in the village. Sutton did not establish itself as a market town like Birmingham was able to, and the market appears to have fallen out of use, as a new charter was later granted to Thomas de Beauchamp, 11th Earl of Warwick, for a market to be held on the same day, as well as fairs on the eve of Holy Trinity and the eve of St. Martin.

During the 12th and 13th centuries, religious activities were carried out at the free chapel of Saint Blaise, constructed within the Sutton manor grounds. In the late 1200s, the town constructed its own parish church, the first incumbent of which was ordained in 1305. This later became Holy Trinity Church, and the only remaining features of the original church survive below the east window, where clasping buttresses are visible, a method of construction from the mid-13th century.

Throughout the 15th century, Sutton Coldfield developed a military connection, due in part to Sir Ralph Bracebridge who obtained a lease for his lifetime from the Earl of Warwick for the Manor and Chase of Sutton Coldfield. In return, Bracebridge was required to assist the Earl with nine lances fournies and seventeen archers in strengthening Calais from French attack. As a result, Sutton Coldfield became an important training location for English soldiers during the wars between England and France. Butts were assembled within the town for archery training, and marks can still be seen in the sandstone wall on 3 Coleshill Street where archers sharpened their arrows. It is believed that 3 Coleshill Street is of medieval origin despite having a Georgian façade. Bracebridge is remembered as having dammed Ebrook to form Bracebridge Pool, now in Sutton Park, which he used for fishing.

=== Tudor Sutton Coldfield, c. 1500–1598 ===
==== Influence of Bishop Vesey ====
By the beginning of the 16th century, the town of Sutton Coldfield had started to decay as a result of the War of the Roses. The markets had been abandoned and the manor house itself was becoming dilapidated. Around 1510, the manor house was demolished by an officer to the Crown, who sold the timbers for a profit to Thomas Grey, 2nd Marquess of Dorset, who used them in the construction of Bradgate House in Leicestershire. It was during the period of decay that John Harman grew up, working at Moor Hall Farm in Sutton and then studying at Magdalen College, Oxford. He formed a friendship with Thomas Wolsey and started a career in the church, beginning with his appointment as chaplain at the free chapel of St. Blaize in his hometown in 1495. Harman continued to be promoted and became Chaplain to King Henry VIII, with whom he became friends. In 1519, Harman was appointed Bishop of Exeter and changed his surname to Vesey, thus becoming John Vesey.

It was Vesey&#x27;s respected position within the church and his friendship with the king that set about the start of a revival for Sutton Coldfield, spearheaded by Vesey. He had returned to the town in 1524 for the funeral of his mother to discover the town had further deteriorated. He decided to set up residence in the town again and in 1527 obtained two enclosures of land named Moor Yards and Heath Crofts, as well as of land for him to construct his own home named Moor Hall. In the same year, he established a grammar school in the southwest corner of the parish churchyard, where 21 people were appointed Trustees to maintain the building and employ a teacher. On 16 December 1528, through the interests of Vesey, Henry VIII granted Sutton Coldfield a charter of incorporation, creating a new form of government for the town which was named the Warden and Society of the Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield. The society consisted of 25 of the most prominent local inhabitants who elected a new Warden from within them. Vesey&#x27;s brother-in-law, William Gibbons, became the first Warden. All the town&#x27;s inhabitants over the age of 22 were permitted to elect members to the Society. The charter had also given the inhabitants permission to hunt and fish freely in the manor grounds, as well as build a house, enclosing up to , within the manor grounds. Throughout the length of the Society&#x27;s existence, it was dogged by claims of corruption and malpractice from the town&#x27;s residents.

The donation by King Henry VIII of his hunting land to the residents of the town set the foundations for the preservation of the area now known as Sutton Park. Vesey cleared large tracts of the land of trees to allow residents to graze their cattle there for a small fee. He then enclosed wooded areas within the land, added gates and fencing around the park, and then arranged for the transfer of horses to the park at his own expense. Bishop Vesey also paid for the whole town to be paved, which in turn helped revive the markets. In 1527, he set about working on Holy Trinity Church, donating an organ in 1530 and then paying for the construction of two new aisles in 1533. In 1540, he approved the transfer of control of the grammar school to the Warden and Society, and gave the school land for its own use the following year. To help expand the town and protect its extremities, he constructed 51 cottages for the poor, including one at Cotty&#x27;s Moor which was a hotspot for robberies of people using the roads. The stone walls of the former manor house were removed to assist in the construction of a bridge at Water Orton and another in Curdworth, at his own expense. In 1547, he purchased from the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, and in 1549, from the Crown, numerous church properties including the chantry lands of Sutton Coldfield, and those in Deritend, Birmingham, before dying at Moor Hall in 1555. Vesey&#x27;s legacy is clearly visible today, with Sutton Park largely unchanged since its enclosure, some stone cottages remaining, and the grammar school he established still operating under the name of Bishop Vesey&#x27;s Grammar School. His tomb at Holy Trinity Church is accompanied by memorial gardens to the west of the church named Vesey Gardens.

Moor Hall, Bishop Vesey&#x27;s residence, was inherited by his nephew John Harman after Vesey&#x27;s death. He sold the mansion to John Richardson, who died in 1584, leaving an infant son. A manor by the name of Pool Hall is first mentioned as being in the town in 1581, and in the following year, William Charnells leased it for 20 years to Henry Goodere, who transferred the rights to John Aylmer, Bishop of London, in 1583. Upon the Aylmer&#x27;s death in 1594, the manor was passed on to his sons, who sold it to Robert Burdett in 1598. It is believed that the properties at 62 and 64 Birmingham Road were constructed around 1530, making it one of the oldest surviving buildings in the town. Nearby 68 Birmingham Road dates to the end of the 1500s.

==== Emergence of industry ====
During the 16th century, the waters and pools within Sutton were exploited for industrial purposes and, following the death of Vesey, the town continued to prosper and expand. In 1510, two watermills under the ownership of William Weston were recorded, and upon the establishment of the park, he was forced to pay rent on them. Three other mills were recorded in 1576 after they were sold to two unnamed local men. In 1585, John Bull sold a water-fulling mill and two blade-mills, which would have been powered by water, to Edward Sprott. Four additional mills were recorded in 1588, and another two in 1595. A blade mill was constructed at Bracebridge Pool in 1597, on a site now occupied by Park House. Despite the growth of industry here, five pools in total were drained in the 16th century, although some were recreated later, including Bracebridge Pool and Keeper&#x27;s Pool.

=== 17th and 18th centuries ===
==== Civil war, unrest and governance ====
The outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 saw the Battle of Camp Hill at nearby Birmingham, which resulted in Birmingham being pillaged by Royalist forces. Despite the nearby action, Sutton Coldfield emerged unscathed, although it is known that it was visited by both Parliamentary and Royalist soldiers. It is claimed that during his escape from England in 1646, Charles II stayed for a night at New Hall Manor.

On 26 July 1664, King Charles II renewed the royal charter for Sutton Coldfield, with the additional provision being made for the appointment of two members of the Society as capital burgesses and also as justices of the peace alongside the Warden.

Following his trial and three-year suspension from preaching, the violently anti-Presbyterian Henry Sacheverell retired to New Hall, the home of his once-removed first cousin, George Sacheverell. Henry Sacheverell preached a vitriolic sermon at Sutton Church on Sunday 17 October 1714, which fuelled Birmingham&#x27;s contribution to the nationwide rioting the following Wednesday, the day of King George I&#x27;s coronation. It also appears that, whilst residing in New Hall, he helped ferment the anti-Presbyterian &quot;Church in danger&quot; riots of July 1715, when, according to a correspondent of George Berkeley, up to 4000 rioters gathered in Birmingham, twenty-eight rioters died, and no more than three Dissenters&#x27; meeting-houses survived in Birmingham, Worcestershire and Staffordshire. 

The town became a temporary refuge in 1791, following the &quot;Priestley Riots&quot; in Birmingham. William Hutton, for example, whose house was attacked by protesters, decided to spend the summer in Sutton. However, local residents&#x27; fears of further rioting forced him to move permanently to Tamworth. Joseph Priestley is said to have stayed at the &#x27;Three Tuns&#x27; following the destruction of his home in the riots, and his initial flight to Heath-forge, Wombourne.

==== Industrial growth ====
The manufacture of blades, gun barrels, spades, and spade handles, as well as the grinding of knives, bayonets, and axes, mainly at mills constructed at pools in Sutton Park and on the banks of Ebrook, became an important contributor to the town&#x27;s economy in the 17th century. The blade mill at Bracebridge Pool fell out of use by 1678 and was destroyed; however, it was reconstructed by 1729. The creation of Longmoor Pool, caused by the damming of Longmoor Brook in Longmoor Valley, was approved in 1733 and carried about by John Riland, who built a mill there in 1754 with his co-tenant for the manufacture of buttons. Blackroot Pool was also constructed in around 1757 by Edward Homer and Joseph Duncomb. In 1772, the Warden and Society of the town gave a lease of 30 years to Thomas Ingram at the pool. The mill at Blackroot Pool was originally used for leather dressing, although later became a sawmill.

Powell&#x27;s Pool was created in 1730 as a millpond for Powell&#x27;s Pool Mill, a steel-rolling mill. In 1733, a cotton-spinning machine was tested at the mill by John Wyatt with the help of Lewis Paul, helping to kickstart the creation of the UK&#x27;s cotton industry in the 18th century. In total, Sutton Coldfield has had 15 watermills, 13 of which were powered by Plants Brook, and the remaining two using an independent water supply. There were also two windmills in the town, at Maney Hill and at Langley.

A heavy storm caused the collapse of the dam holding back the waters of Wyndley Pool, which swept downstream and broke the banks of Mill Pool at Mill Street in July 1668, subsequently flooding and destroying many homes within Sutton Coldfield. Bracebridge Pool also broke its banks as a result of the storm on 24 July, causing lesser damage. Wyndley Pool was subsequently drained, although there is another pool within Sutton Park with the same name.

Much of the damming in Sutton Coldfield was carried out using stone and gravel quarried from within the town. These quarries also supplied stone for construction elsewhere in the town, proving to be particularly profitable. The quarry that supplied material for the construction of Blackroot Pool in 1759 was in use until 1914.

==== Financial prosperity and town growth ====
During the 17th and 18th centuries, the town prospered from the growth of industry and this led to improvements in the quality of life for the residents. They were now able to experience new luxuries such as seafood. Products were 10% more expensive in Sutton Coldfield than in neighbouring towns and villages. The town also grew, due in part to the wealthy industrialists of Birmingham seeing Sutton Coldfield as a suitable location for their country houses, away from the pollution of the larger town. A survey of the parish in 1630 reported that there were 298 houses, and this number had increased to 310 when another survey was conducted in 1698. Of these houses would have been 20 High Street, which was built around 1675. A survey of the parish in 1721 noted that the number of houses in Sutton Coldfield had increased to 360. In 1636, King Charles I imposed the ship money tax of £80 on the town, compared to £100 for Birmingham and Warwick, £266 for Coventry, and £50 for Stafford, reflecting the wealth of the town at the time. In 1663, an Act was passed to order and collect &quot;Hearth Duty&quot;, which led to a subsequent survey of all houses in the country and the noting of all properties with hearths and stoves. The survey of Sutton Coldfield found that there were 67 hearths and stoves, of which 30 were attributed to two houses owned by the Willoughby family.

Some of Sutton Coldfield&#x27;s most prominent buildings were constructed or underwent changes during this time. For example, the current Peddimore Hall was constructed in 1659 by William Wood to a design by William Wilson, who took up residence in the town and married the widowed landowner, Jane Pudsey, in 1681. Her daughters disapproved of the relationship and she was forced out of her home at Langley Hall, resulting in Wilson constructing Moat House for the couple in 1680. Another of his works in the town was Four Oaks Hall, designed for Henry Folliott, 1st Baron Folliott, who was the husband of Wilson&#x27;s stepdaughter. Along with the hall, Lord Folliott enclosed of woodland.

In 1610, New Hall Manor was purchased by Henry Sacheverell, the family of which were prominent landowners throughout the country. Upon his death in 1620, the hall was inherited first by Valence Sacheverell, and then by George Sacheverell, his eldest son. Notable buildings that were constructed in the town during the 18th century include the Royal Hotel on High Street, which dates to circa 1750. The &#x27;Three Tuns&#x27; public house, also on High Street, dates to the late 18th century, although it retains the cellars and foundations of an earlier building.

=== Industrial revolution, 1800–1900 ===
==== Municipal projects and change of government ====
The 1800s would prove to be another century of major change for the town, built upon the wealth it had generated in years before and the power that the Sutton Coldfield Corporation had. Dealing with a growing town, they sought to improve the quality of life for residents. The corporation was forced to fell trees within the town and sell the timber as means to fund the construction of schools and almshouses. In 1826, timber worth £1,116 3s. was sold. The first of these schools were founded during the 1820s. The corporation also constructed two almshouses in Walmley in 1828 and a further two adjacent in 1863. By 1837, there were ten almshouses in the parish under the ownership of the corporation, with others operated by charities.

The town hall at the top of Mill Street began to deteriorate throughout the 1800s and the decision was taken to demolish it in 1854. The adjacent workhouse and gaol were renovated to become the new municipal offices, and this was reconstructed in 1858 until 1859 to better suit its purpose. The new offices were designed by G. Bidlake. A fire station was also constructed further down Mill Street.

During the 1830s, municipal corporations were investigated due to corrupt practices within the House of Commons. These inquiries led to the passing of the Reform Act 1832 and Municipal Corporations Act 1835 which reformed boroughs nationwide. Despite the radical changes imposed by the Acts, the Sutton Coldfield Corporation was left untouched. It was not until April 1882, as a result of the Municipal Corporations Act 1882, that Sutton Coldfield became a municipal borough. The old Corporation was replaced with a new structure consisting of a mayor, six aldermen and eighteen elected councillors. Six wards were created in the borough – Holy Trinity, Hill, Boldmere, Wylde Green, Maney, and Walmley – from each of which three councillors were elected.

==== Arrival of the railways ====
For the majority of the 19th century, people travelled between Birmingham and Sutton Coldfield by horse-drawn carriage, a journey that took around 80 minutes. Birmingham received its first railway in 1837 with a terminus at Vauxhall station, now Duddeston railway station. In 1859, an act of Parliament was passed for the construction of a railway line connecting Birmingham to Sutton Coldfield via Erdington. Construction commenced in 1860 on the line which passed through Vauxhall station, although by this time it was being used only as a goods station. The line opened on 2 June 1862 with Sutton Coldfield railway station being the terminus. An act of Parliament for the continuation of the railway to Lichfield was passed on 23 June 1874, with construction starting in October 1881 and services beginning in 1884. The line was extended to Lichfield Trent Valley railway station on 28 November 1888.

A proposed second railway line by the Wolverhampton, Walsall and Midland Junction Railway Company through Sutton Coldfield was met with opposition from residents who were concerned about the route cutting through Sutton Park. A meeting objecting to the proposal was held on 15 April 1872, however, construction was authorised on 6 August in the same year. The WWMJR company merged with Midland Railway in 1874 and construction commenced soon after. To calm objections from residents, Midland Railway promised cheap local coal and paid £6,500 for a stretch through Sutton Park. Services on the line began on 1 July 1879, with trains stopping at Penns (Walmley), Sutton Coldfield Town, and Sutton Park in the town, as well as at Streetly, Aldridge, and Walsall. Ultimately, the line connected the Midland Railway&#x27;s Wolverhampton and Walsall Railway line to their Birmingham to Derby line.

The railways quickly led to Sutton Coldfield becoming a popular location for day excursions and picnic parties for the residents of Birmingham, escaping the pollution of the city for the landscapes of Sutton Park. The 1863 edition of &quot;Bradshaw&#x27;s Guide&quot; described Sutton Coldfield as &quot;a place of no very particular note, beyond an occasional pic-nic excursion&quot;. In the Whit week of 1882, 19,549 people visited Sutton Park, with numbers dropping to 11,378 in the same week the following year. In 1884, there were 17,486 visitors, of whom 14,000 went on the Monday. In 1865, on a small eminence adjacent to Sutton Coldfield station, the Royal Hotel was constructed, hoping to capitalise on the new tourist industry the town was witnessing. The hotel was beset with financial difficulties and closed down in 1895, becoming Sutton Coldfield Sanatorium for a short period of time.

As well as becoming a tourist spot, Sutton Coldfield became popular with people who worked in Birmingham and also were able to live away from the pollution of the city and travel to the city and town by train. During the late 19th century, it was the wealthy manufacturers who moved to Sutton Coldfield, and it was not until the turn of the century that ordinary workers were able to move as well.

In 1836, George Bodington acquired an asylum and sanatorium at Driffold House (now the Royal cinema), Maney, where he researched pulmonary disease.

==== Population growth and public facilities ====
The first census of Sutton Coldfield took place in 1801. It recorded that the town had a population of 2,847. The following census of 1811 recorded that this had risen to 2,959 with 617 houses. This was partially down to the construction of barracks to the east to accommodate the Edinburgh and Sussex Militias, the 7th Dragoon Guards and a Brigade of Artillery. By 1821, the population had further increased to 3,426 and then to 3,684 in 1831. The census of 1881 revealed that the population had increased from 4,662 in 1861 to 7,737.

The increasing population of Sutton Coldfield parish was recognised in the mid-19th century and new ecclesiastical parishes were created from it to better serve the residents of the communities that made up Sutton. The first ecclesiastical parish to be created was Walmley in 1846, with the recently completed St. John the Evangelist Church becoming the parish church. Hill became the next ecclesiastical parish in 1853, with its church being St. James&#x27; Church in Mere Green. Boldmere parish was created in 1857, with St. Michael&#x27;s Church becoming its parish church. Holy Trinity Church was further extended with a north outer aisle and vestries in 1874–9.

The construction of Shenstone Pumping Station in 1892 . In 1870, W.T. Parsons began the publication of Sutton Coldfield&#x27;s first newspaper &quot;Sutton Coldfield News&quot;.

==== &quot;Ashford v Thornton&quot; ====

Sutton Coldfield was the focus of national attention in 1817 when a young woman named Mary Ashford was found murdered in the town. She had been attending a party in Erdington on the evening of 26 May 1817, and had left with Abraham Thornton and her friend Hannah Cox, who left Mary and Abraham. The following morning, her body was recovered from a water-filled pit by Penns Lane, Erdington. Thornton was quickly traced and arrested for her murder. At the trial, Thornton provided evidence that it was not possible for him to have killed Mary at the suggested time. As a result, the jury found him not guilty of her murder and rape, allowing him to walk free from the court.

Public response to the acquittal was that of outrage and a private appeal was brought against the verdict by Mary&#x27;s brother, William Ashford. Thornton was taken to London where he was tried at the King&#x27;s Bench. When Thornton was called upon for his plea, he responded, &quot;Not guilty; and I am ready to defend the same with my body.&quot; He then put on one of a pair of leather gauntlets, which his barrister, William Reader, handed him. Thornton threw down the other for William Ashford to pick up and thus accept the challenge, which Ashford did not do. By Ashford not accepting the challenge under the trial by combat laws, Thornton was freed, although by this time he gained a notorious reputation. In 1819, a bill was introduced and an Act passed to abolish private appeals after acquittals and also abolish trial by combat.

=== 20th century ===
In the 20th century, Sutton Coldfield continued to grow. The areas on the fringes of the district remained rural up until the end of World War I. As witnessed nationally, there was a house construction boom in areas such as Boldmere, Walmley, Erdington and Four Oaks. Again, the population increased rapidly. During World War II, Sutton Park and areas of Walmley were used as prisoner-of-war camps, housing German and Italian prisoners. After the war, Sutton witnessed a major redevelopment. The Borough Council commissioned Max Lock and Partners to draw up plans for the redevelopment of the town centre in 1960, with a preliminary report being delivered in May 1961 and a detailed report in 1962. The Parade in the town centre was almost completely demolished for the construction of a large new shopping centre named Gracechurch. In addition, shopping centres in Wylde Green and Mere Green were constructed causing considerable objection as many local landmarks were lost to the developers.

==== Merging into Birmingham ====
In 1974, Sutton Coldfield became part of Birmingham when the metropolitan county of the West Midlands was formed. More recently, areas of the town centre have been pedestrianised.

Plans for the proposed construction of five tower blocks for pensioners at Brassington Avenue in the town centre were abandoned in November 2015.

On 1 March 2015, a new Sutton Coldfield parish council was formally incorporated. This handed over parish council powers from Birmingham City Council.

== Governance ==
In 1528, a charter of King Henry VIII gave the town the right to be known as &quot;The Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield&quot; and to be governed by a warden and society. The charter was secured by Bishop John Vesey. This unreformed corporation survived until 1885, when it was replaced by a municipal borough. Although the title &quot;Royal Town&quot; was still used, the municipality created in 1885 was not itself a Royal borough. However, the townspeople sometimes still use its historic &#x27;Royal&#x27; title. This was confirmed to be allowed in 2014 after a two-year campaign by a local newspaper, the &quot;Sutton Coldfield Observer&quot;, Andrew Mitchell MP, the Sutton Coldfield Civic Society and various local residents. On Thursday, 12 June 2014 government minister Greg Clark confirmed during a special adjournment debate in the House of Commons that &quot;there is no statutory ban to the continuance of historic titles for other [non-governance] purposes&quot; in the absence of a local governing structure using a historic name, and thus the use of the Royal title is not prohibited (although any such usage has a &quot;lack of technical legal effect&quot;). Following that confirmation, the newspaper renamed itself the &quot;Royal Sutton Coldfield Observer&quot;.

The town and borough were ceremonially part of Warwickshire until 1974, when it was amalgamated into the City of Birmingham and the metropolitan county of the West Midlands. The formal Mayoral chains of office are now on display in Birmingham Council House.

Sutton Coldfield forms the Sutton Coldfield parliamentary constituency, the largest Parliamentary Constituency in Birmingham whose member of parliament (MP) since 2001 has been Andrew Mitchell (Conservative). Within the City of Birmingham metropolitan borough, it comprises the wards of Sutton Four Oaks, Sutton Mere Green, Sutton New Hall, Sutton Reddicap, Sutton Roughly, Sutton Trinity, Sutton Vesey, Sutton Walmley &amp; Minworth, and Sutton Wylde Green. The ward of Erdington ceased to be part of the constituency in 1974 due to the Local Government Act of 1972. Sutton Trinity ward was created in June 2004, at which time the then other three wards&#x27; boundaries were changed. From 5 April 2004, it has been a council constituency, with many local services managed by a district committee made up of all Sutton&#x27;s councillors.

In 2015 the eligible electorate within the Royal town&#x27;s boundary were asked whether they wished to be governed by an independent Town council. The result of the election was that almost 70% were in favour of a Sutton Coldfield Town Council. Work is now ongoing in the Birmingham City Council to create a new council and decide which powers to transfer. The first parish council election took place on 5 May 2016.

== Geography ==
Areas of Sutton Coldfield include:
Sutton Coldfield borders the counties of Staffordshire and Warwickshire as well as the Metropolitan Borough of Sandwell, Metropolitan Borough of Solihull and Metropolitan Borough of Walsall. The town in general is regarded by its own populace as one of the most prestigious locations in the Birmingham area and even in Central England; a 2007 report by the website Mouseprice.com placed two Sutton Coldfield streets amongst the 20 most expensive in the United Kingdom.

The northern stretch of the Birmingham city sandstone ridge culminates at Sutton Coldfield. Plants Brook rises in the area of Streetly and flows through Sutton Park and directly beneath the town centre, then Plants Brook briefly flows through Erdington, notably Pype Hayes Park before returning to Sutton and culminating at Plantsbrook Nature Reserve on the Erdington / Walmley border at Eachelhurst Road.

== Retail ==
The main shopping centre is the Gracechurch Centre, built in 1974. For a number of years this centre was called The Mall. The complex includes a multi-storey car park. As a result of investment, the appearance of the shopping centre was improved in 2006, which included the installation of a glass roof above one of the walkways and the removal of a public square to form a cafe and extra retail units. The shopping centre was formerly home to three bronze sculptures that depict, respectively, a boy and a girl on rollerskates, a boy with a dog, and a boy and a girl playing leapfrog, which have been moved to Rectory Park.

A second shopping centre was named the Sainsbury Centre until Sainsbury&#x27;s closed their store; the name was later changed to &quot;The Red Rose Centre&quot;. The centre has its own multi-storey car park (now disused) with access from Victoria Road.

Sutton Parade is a continuation of Birmingham Road and Lichfield Road (though there is a bypass for traffic). New Hall Walk is a row of shops built behind The Parade in the late 1990s. The company that manages the site also manages several of the shops on the Parade built at the same time. It has its own large outdoor car park. Opposite the Red Rose Centre, behind New Hall Walk, is a single floor, indoor market facility known as the In Shops.

=== The green belt ===
Birmingham has 4,153 hectares of green belt, about 15% of the city&#x27;s land area. The majority of this is in the north of the city, particularly to the north and east of Sutton Coldfield. The current green belt within Birmingham was initially installed in place in 1955 and was last reviewed around 20 years ago, since then the boundaries have remained unchanged.

Sutton Coldfield&#x27;s green belt is being extensively developed with over 5500 houses to be built and a large industrial complex currently under construction. The Langley Sustainable Urban Extension (SUE) and the 71 hectare Peddimore site have been approved and will destroy much of the green belt.

== Public facilities ==

== Transport ==

Linked by frequent and fast services from Sutton Coldfield railway station on the Cross-City Line to the centre of Birmingham, Sutton is mostly a commuter dormitory town for people who work in Birmingham. The 1955 Sutton Coldfield rail crash occurred here, when an express train entered the very tight curve through the station much faster than the speed limit of . The Sutton Park Line also crosses the town roughly perpendicular to the cross-city line (crossing at a point out of easy sight near the former Midland Road station), but lost its passenger services and stations in the 1964 &quot;Beeching Axe&quot;. It retained a loading bay at the adjacent Clifton Road Royal Mail sorting office for a time, but now remains as a freight only line.

The Roman road Icknield Street cuts through Sutton Park to the west of the town. The town is bypassed to the north by the M6 Toll, the first toll motorway in the UK, accessible from Sutton by junction T2 at Minworth (co-located with the M42 junction), T3 and T4 (interchanging with the A38 at the south and north ends of their parallel run), and T5 at Shenstone. It also has easy access to the M6 to the South, via junctions 5 (Castle Bromwich), J6 (Gravelly Hill, or &quot;Spaghetti Junction&quot;) and J7 at Great Barr; and also the M42 in the east, via junction 9 near Minworth.

The A38 itself used to run through the centre of the town (literally, using the since-pedestrianised line of the Parade), but now uses the dual carriageway bypass to the east. The former route of the A38 is now the A5127 Lichfield Road, branching from the southern end of the Aston Expressway on the Birmingham Middleway ring road, and continues to provide a major connective route running between and on slightly altered paths through the centres of Erdington, Sutton and Lichfield.

<text>The pound sign () is the symbol for the pound unit of sterling – the currency of the United Kingdom and its associated Crown Dependencies and British Overseas Territories and previously of Great Britain and of the Kingdom of England. The same symbol is used for other currencies called pound, such as the Egyptian and Syrian pounds. The sign may be drawn with one or two bars depending on personal preference, but the Bank of England has used the one-bar style exclusively on banknotes since 1975.

In the United States, &quot;pound sign&quot; refers to the symbol (number sign). In Canada, &quot;pound sign&quot; can mean or .

==Origin==
The symbol derives from the upper case Latin letter , representing &quot;libra pondo&quot;, the basic unit of weight in the Roman Empire, which in turn is derived from the Latin word &quot;libra&quot;, meaning scales or a balance. The pound became an English unit of weight and in England became defined as the tower pound (equivalent to 350 grams) of sterling silver. According to the Royal Mint Museum:
However, the simple letter L, in lower- or uppercase, was used to represent the pound in printed books and newspapers until well into the 19th century. In the blackletter type used until the seventeenth century, the letter L is rendered as formula_1.

==Usage==
When used for sterling, the pound sign is placed before the numerals (e.g., £12,000) and separated from the following digits by no space or only a thin space. In the UK, the sign is used without any prefix. In Egypt and Lebanon, a disambiguating letter is added (E£ or £E and £L respectively). In international banking and foreign exchange operations, the symbol is rarely used: the ISO 4217 currency code (e.g., GBP, EGP, etc.) is preferred.

== Other English variants ==
In Canadian English, the symbol is called the pound sign. The symbol has several uses and is sometimes called the pound sign too, though it is most often known as the number sign. (Telephone instructions for equipment manufactured in the United States often call the pound key.)

In American English, the term &quot;pound sign&quot; usually refers to the symbol (number sign), and the corresponding telephone key is called the &quot;pound key&quot;. (As in Canada, the # symbol has many other uses.)

==Historic variants==
===Double bar style ===
Banknotes issued by the Bank of England since 1975 have used only the single bar style as a pound sign. The bank used both the two-bar style () and the one-bar style () (and sometimes a figure without any symbol whatever) more or less equally from 1725 to 1971 intermittently and sometimes concurrently. In typography, the symbols are allographs style choices when used to represent the pound; consequently fonts use (Unicode) code point irrespective of which style chosen, (not despite its similarity). It is a font design choice on how to draw the symbol at U+00A3. Although most computer fonts do so with one bar, the two-bar style is not rare, as may be seen in the illustration above.

===Other===

In the eighteenth-century Caslon metal fonts, the pound sign was identical to an italic uppercase J, rotated 180 degrees.

== Use with computers ==
In the Unicode standard, the pound sign is encoded at Whether the glyph is drawn with one or two bars is a type designer&#x27;s choice as explained above; the key point is that the code is constant irrespective of the presentation chosen.

The encoding of the £ symbol in position xA3 (16310) was first standardised by ISO Latin-1 (an &quot;extended ASCII&quot;) in 1985. Position xA3 was used by the Digital Equipment Corporation VT220 terminal, Mac OS Roman, Amstrad CPC, Amiga, and Acorn Archimedes.

Many early computers (limited to a 7-bit, 128-position character set) used a variant of ASCII with one of the less-frequently used characters replaced by the £. The UK national variant of ISO 646 was standardised as BS 4730 in 1985. This code was identical to ASCII except for two characters: x23 encoded instead of , while x7E encoded (overline) instead of (tilde). MS-DOS on the IBM PC originally used a proprietary 8-bit character set Code page 437 in which the £ symbol was encoded as x9C; adoption of the ISO/IEC 8859-1 (&quot;ISO Latin-1&quot;) standard code xA3 only came later with Microsoft Windows. The Atari ST also used position x9C. The HP LaserJet used position xBA (ISO/IEC 8859-1: ) for the £ symbol, while most other printers used x9C. The BBC Ceefax system which dated from 1976 encoded the £ as x23. The Sinclair ZX80 and ZX81 characters sets used x0C (ASCII: form feed). The ZX Spectrum and the BBC Micro used x60 (ASCII: , grave). The Commodore 64 used x5C (ASCII: ) while the Oric computers used x5F (ASCII: ). IBM&#x27;s EBCDIC code page 037 uses xB1 for the £ while its code page 285 uses x5B. ICL&#x27;s 1900-series mainframes used a six-bit (64-position character set) encoding for characters, loosely based on BS 4730, with the £ symbol represented as octal 23 (hex 13, dec 19).

== Entry methods ==
=== Typewriters ===
Typewriters produced for the British market included a &quot;£&quot; sign from the earliest days, though its position varied widely. A 1921 advertisement for an Imperial Typewriters model D, for example shows a machine with two modifier shifts (CAPS and FIG), with the &quot;£&quot; sign occupying the FIG shift position on the key for letter &quot;B&quot;. But the advertisement notes that &quot;We make special keyboards containing symbols, fractions, signs, etc., for the peculiar needs of Engineers, Builders, Architects, Chemists, Scientists, etc., or any staple trade.&quot;

On Latin-alphabet typewriters lacking a &quot;£&quot; symbol type element, a reasonable approximation could be made by overtyping an &quot;f&quot; over an &quot;L&quot;. Historically, &quot;L&quot; overtyped with a hyphen or an equals sign was also used.

=== Compose key ===
The compose key sequence is:

=== Windows, Linux, Unix ===
On Microsoft Windows, Linux and Unix, the UK keyboard layout has the &quot;£&quot; symbol on the 3 number key and is typed using:

On a US-International keyboard in Windows, the &quot;£&quot; can be entered using:
* (on keyboards without an engraved AltGr key)

On a US-International keyboard in Linux and Unix, the &quot;£&quot; can be entered using:
* followed by 

In Windows, it may also be generated through the Alt keycodes, although the results vary depending on factors such as the locale, codepage and OS version:
* + (keeping Alt pressed until all 4 digits have been typed on the numeric keypad only)
* + (this also works in MS-DOS)

Windows also supports the combination but this combination may be overridden by applications for other purposes.

The Character Map utility and Microsoft Word&#x27;s &quot;Insert Symbol&quot; commands may also be used to enter this character.

=== Mac OS ===
The symbol &quot;£&quot; is in the MacRoman character set and can be generated on most non-UK Mac OS keyboard layouts which do not have a dedicated key for it, typically through:
On UK Apple Mac keyboards, this is reversed, with the &quot;£&quot; symbol on the number 3 key, typed using:
* (and the number sign &quot;#&quot; generated by )

===Android===
Pressing and holding the local currency sign will invoke a pop-up box presenting an array of currency signs, from which the pound sign may be chosen.

== Other uses ==
The logo of the UK Independence Party, a British political party, is based on the pound sign, symbolising the party&#x27;s opposition to adoption of the euro and to the European Union generally.

A symbol that appears to be a double-barred pound sign is used as the logo of the record label Parlophone. In fact this is a stylised version of a Fraktur L (formula_1), standing for Lindström (the firm&#x27;s founder Carl Lindström).

The pound sign was used as an uppercase letter (the lowercase being , long s) to signify the sound in the early 1993–1995 version of the Turkmen Latin alphabet.

<text>Robert Gibson (November 9, 1935October 2, 2020), nicknamed &quot;Gibby&quot; and &quot;Hoot&quot;, was an American baseball pitcher in Major League Baseball who played his entire career for the St. Louis Cardinals from 1959 to 1975. Known for his fiercely competitive nature, Gibson tallied 251 wins, 3,117 strikeouts, and a 2.91 earned run average. A nine-time All-Star and two-time World Series Champion, he won two Cy Young Awards and the 1968 National League Most Valuable Player Award.

Born in Omaha, Nebraska, Gibson overcame childhood illness to excel in youth sports, particularly basketball and baseball. After briefly playing with the Harlem Globetrotters basketball team, he chose to pursue baseball and signed with the St. Louis Cardinals organization. He became a full-time starting pitcher in July 1961 and earned his first All-Star appearance in 1962. Gibson won 2 of 3 games he pitched in the 1964 World Series, then won 20 games in a season for the first time in 1965. Gibson also pitched three complete game victories in the 1967 World Series. He is one of four players and two pitchers to win multiple World Series MVPs.

The pinnacle of Gibson&#x27;s career was 1968, during the &quot;Year of the Pitcher&quot;, which is regarded as one of the greatest single pitching seasons of all-time; he posted a 1.12 ERA for the season and then recorded 17 strikeouts in Game 1 of the 1968 World Series. Gibson threw a no-hitter in 1971 but began experiencing swelling in his knee in subsequent seasons. At the time of his retirement in 1975, Gibson ranked second only to Walter Johnson among major-league pitchers in career strikeouts. When describing Gibson’s career, his former all-star teammate Tim McCarver jokingly remarked, &quot;Bob Gibson is the luckiest pitcher in baseball. He always pitches when the other team doesn&#x27;t score any runs.”

He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1981, his first year of eligibility, and the Cardinals retired his uniform number 45 in September 1975, the year he retired. Gibson was later selected for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. He died of pancreatic cancer on October 2, 2020.

==Early life==
Gibson was born in Omaha, Nebraska, on November 9, 1935, the youngest of Victoria (née Brown) and Pack Gibson&#x27;s seven children. Gibson&#x27;s father died of tuberculosis three months prior to Gibson&#x27;s birth, and he was named &quot;Pack Robert Gibson&quot;, in honor of his late father. While he revered his father&#x27;s legacy, Gibson disliked the name &quot;Pack&quot; and later legally dropped it.

Although afflicted by rickets and respiratory disease as a child, Gibson was active in sports, particularly baseball and basketball, in both informal and organized settings. Gibson&#x27;s brother Josh, 15 years his senior, had a profound effect on his early life, serving as his mentor and a father figure. Gibson played on a number of youth basketball and baseball teams his brother coached, many of which were organized through the local YMCA.

Gibson attended Omaha Technical High School, where he participated on the track, basketball, and baseball teams. Gibson was named to the All-State basketball team during his senior year of high school by a newspaper in Lincoln, Nebraska, and soon after won a full athletic scholarship for basketball from Creighton University. Indiana University had rejected him after stating their &quot;Negro athlete quota&quot; had already been filled.

While at Creighton, Gibson majored in sociology, and continued to experience success playing basketball. At the end of his junior basketball season, he averaged 22 points per game, and made third team Jesuit All-American. As his graduation from Creighton approached, the spring of 1957 proved to be a busy time for Gibson. Aside from getting married, Gibson had garnered the interest of the Harlem Globetrotters basketball team and the St. Louis Cardinals baseball team.

Gibson eventually signed a deal which allowed him to play baseball in the Cardinals minor league system for the rest of the summer after which he would play for the Globetrotters for four months. After the four months were over, he and the Cardinals agreed that he would focus solely on baseball; he received a $3,000 ($ today) signing bonus to sign with the team.

== Baseball career ==
===Early struggles===
Gibson made his pitching debut for the Omaha Cardinals of the American Association, one of the Cardinals&#x27; Triple-A affiliates. He struggled against Triple-A hitting however, recording an earned run average of 4.29 in his first ten games, including four starts. He was reassigned to the Columbus Foxes of the South Atlantic League, the team&#x27;s Single-A affiliate where his performance improved a little; making eight starts, he recorded an earned run average of 3.77 for the team.

The following season, he was first assigned to the Rochester Red Wings of the International League, another Triple-A affiliate of the Cardinals. He improved significantly, recording an earned run average of 2.45 in twenty games, including eleven starts. He threw seven complete games and 103 innings. The Cardinals reassigned him to Omaha where his performance slightly worsened, with an ERA of 3.31 in eleven starts, though he did record his first professional shutout.

Gibson was assigned to the Cardinals&#x27; big league roster for the start of the 1959 season, making his Major League debut on April 15 against the Los Angeles Dodgers; he pitched two innings in relief, giving up two runs, including a home run to Jim Baxes, the very first batter he faced. Reassigned to their Omaha affiliate soon after, Gibson returned to the Major Leagues on July 30 to make his first career start; he earned his first Major League win the same day, a shutout against the Cincinnati Reds.

Gibson&#x27;s experience in 1960 was similar to his first season in the majors, pitching nine innings for the Cardinals before shuffling between the Cardinals and their Rochester affiliate until mid-June. After posting a 3–6 record with a 5.61 ERA for the season, Gibson traveled to Venezuela to participate in winter baseball at the conclusion of the 1960 season. He was also sent to Puerto Rico to play for the Cangrejeros de Santurce before and after the 1961 season.

Cardinals manager Solly Hemus shuffled Gibson between the bullpen and the starting pitching rotation for the first half of the 1961 season. Years later, Gibson indicated that Hemus&#x27;s racial prejudice played a major role in his misuse of Gibson, as well as of teammate Curt Flood, both of whom were told by Hemus that they would not make it as major leaguers and should try something else. Hemus was replaced as Cardinals manager in July 1961 by Johnny Keane, who had been Gibson&#x27;s manager on the Omaha minor league affiliate several years prior. Keane and Gibson shared a positive professional relationship, and Keane immediately moved Gibson into the starting pitching rotation full-time. Gibson proceeded to compile an 11–6 record the remainder of the year, and posted a 3.24 ERA for the full season.

Off the field, Gibson, along with teammates Bill White and Curt Flood, started a movement to make all players live in the same clubhouse and hotel rooms. Their campaign led the St. Louis Cardinals to become the first sports team to end segregation, three years before President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

In late May of the 1962 season, Gibson pitched consecutive scoreless innings on his way to being named an All-Star for the first time. He was named to both All-Star Games that year, pitching two innings in the second. Despite suffering a fractured ankle late in the season, Gibson still finished 1962 with his first 200-strikeout season.

The rehabilitation of Gibson&#x27;s ankle was a slow process, and by May 19 of the 1963 season he had recorded only one win. Gibson then turned to rely on his slider and two different fastball pitches to reel off six straight wins prior to late July. He and all other Major League pitchers benefited from a rule change that season which expanded the strike zone. Adding to his pitching performances was Gibson&#x27;s offensive production, with his 20 RBIs outmatching the combined RBI output of entire pitching staffs on other National League teams. Even with Gibson&#x27;s 18 wins and the extra motivation of teammate Stan Musial&#x27;s impending retirement, however, the Cardinals finished six games out of first place.

Building on their late-season pennant run in 1963, the 1964 Cardinals developed a strong camaraderie that was noted for being free of the racial tension that predominated in the United States at that time. Part of this atmosphere stemmed from the integration of the team&#x27;s spring training hotel in 1960, and Gibson and teammate Bill White worked to confront and stop use of racial slurs within the team. On August 23, the Cardinals were 11 games behind the Philadelphia Phillies and remained six-and-a-half games behind on September 21. The combination of a nine-game Cardinals winning streak and a ten-game Phillies losing streak then brought the season down to the final game. The Cardinals faced the New York Mets, and Gibson entered the game as a relief pitcher in the fifth inning. Aware that the Phillies were ahead of the Cincinnati Reds 4–0 at the time he entered the game, Gibson proceeded to pitch four innings of two-hit relief, while his teammates scored 11 runs of support to earn the victory.

They next faced the New York Yankees in the 1964 World Series. Gibson was matched against Yankees starting pitcher Mel Stottlemyre for three of the Series&#x27; seven games, with Gibson losing Game 2, then winning Game 5. In Game 7, Gibson, who only had 2 days rest, pitched into the ninth inning, where he allowed home runs to Phil Linz and Clete Boyer, making the score 7–5 Cardinals. With Ray Sadecki and Barney Schultz warming up in the Cardinal bullpen, Gibson retired Bobby Richardson for the final out, giving the Cardinals their first World Championship since 1946. Along with his two victories, Gibson set a new World Series record by striking out 31 batters.

Gibson made the All-Star team again in the 1965 season, and when the Cardinals were well out of the pennant race by August, attention turned to Gibson to see if he could win 20 games for the first time. Gibson was still looking for win number 20 on the last day of the season, a game where new Cardinals manager Red Schoendienst rested many of the regular players. Gibson still prevailed against the Houston Astros by a score of 5–2.

The 1966 season marked the opening of Busch Memorial Stadium for the Cardinals and Gibson was selected to play in the All-Star Game in front of the hometown crowd, though he did not as he was hurt at the time.

The Cardinals built a -game lead prior to the 1967 season All-Star break, and Gibson pitched the seventh and eighth innings of the 1967 All-Star game. Gibson then faced the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 15, when Roberto Clemente hit a line drive off Gibson&#x27;s right leg. Unaware his leg had been fractured, Gibson faced three more batters before his right fibula bone snapped above the ankle. After Gibson returned on September 7, the Cardinals secured the National League pennant on September 18, games ahead of the San Francisco Giants.

In the 1967 World Series against the Boston Red Sox, Gibson allowed only three earned runs and 14 hits over three complete-game victories in Games 1, 4 (five-hit shutout), and 7, the latter two marks tying Christy Mathewson&#x27;s 1905 World Series record. Just as he had in 1964, Gibson pitched a complete-game victory in Game 7, against Cy Young winner Jim Lonborg, who pitched a one-hitter in Game 2. Gibson also contributed offensively in Game 7 by hitting a home run that made the game 3–0. Unlike his last win as World Series MVP, he finally got the endorsements that had eluded him in 1964, including endorsement and sponsorship for his asthma medication, namely Primatene mist inhaler and tablets.

===1968: Year of the Pitcher===
The 1968 season became known as &quot;The Year of the Pitcher&quot;, and Gibson was at the forefront of pitching dominance. His earned run average was 1.12, a live-ball era record, as well as the major league record in 300 or more innings pitched. It was the lowest major league ERA since Dutch Leonard&#x27;s 0.96 mark 54 years earlier. Additionally, Gibson threw 13 shutouts.

Gibson won all 12 starts in June and July, pitching a complete game every time, (eight of which were shutouts), and allowed only six earned runs in 108 innings pitched (a 0.50 ERA). Gibson pitched 47 consecutive scoreless innings during this stretch, at the time the fourth-longest scoreless streak in major league history. He also struck out 91 batters, and he won two consecutive NL Player of the Month awards. Gibson finished the season with 28 complete games out of 34 games started. Of the games he didn&#x27;t complete, he was pinch-hit for, meaning Gibson was not removed from the mound for another pitcher for the entire season.

Gibson won the National League MVP Award. With Denny McLain winning the American League&#x27;s Most Valuable Player award, 1968 remains, to date, the only year both MVP Awards went to pitchers, with McLain compiling a 31–6 record for the Detroit Tigers.

Gibson lost nine games against 22 wins, despite his record-setting low 1.12 ERA, as the feeble batting throughout baseball included his own team. The 1968 Cardinals had one .300 hitter, while the team-leading home run and RBI totals were just 16 and 79, respectively. Of his nine losses, two were 1–0 games, one of which was against San Francisco Giants pitcher Gaylord Perry&#x27;s no-hitter on September 17. The Giants&#x27; run in that game came on a first-inning home run by light-hitting Ron Hunt, one of only 11 that Gibson allowed in innings.

In Game 1 of the 1968 World Series against the Detroit Tigers, Gibson struck out 17 batters, setting a World Series record for strikeouts in one game and breaking Sandy Koufax&#x27;s record of 15 set in Game 1 of the 1963 World Series. He also joined Ed Walsh as the only pitchers to strike out at least one batter in each inning of a World Series game, Walsh having done so in Game 3 of the 1906 World Series. After allowing a leadoff single to Mickey Stanley in the ninth inning, Gibson finished the game by striking out Tiger sluggers Al Kaline, Norm Cash, and Willie Horton in succession.

Gibson next pitched in Game 4, winning the game by a score of 10–1, beating Tigers&#x27; ace Denny McLain. The teams continued to battle each other, setting the stage for another winner-take-all Game 7 in St. Louis on October 10, 1968. In this game Gibson was matched against Tigers pitcher Mickey Lolich and the two proceeded to hold their opponents scoreless for the first six innings. In the top of the seventh, Gibson retired the first two batters before allowing two consecutive singles. Detroit batter Jim Northrup then hit a two-run triple over the head of center fielder Curt Flood, leading to Detroit&#x27;s Series win.

The overall pitching statistics in the 1968 season, led by Gibson and McLain&#x27;s record-setting performances, are often cited as one of the reasons for Major League Baseball&#x27;s decision to alter pitching-related rules. Sometimes known as the &quot;Gibson rules&quot;, Major League Baseball lowered the pitcher&#x27;s mound in 1969 from to – though teams had rarely followed this rule nor was it enforced by the league – and reduced the height of the strike zone from the batter&#x27;s armpits to the jersey letters.

===Final years===
Aside from the rule changes set to take effect in 1969, cultural and monetary influences increasingly began impacting baseball, as evidenced by nine players from the Cardinals&#x27; 1968 roster who had not reported by the first week of spring training due to the status of their contracts. On February 4, 1969, Gibson appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, and said the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) had suggested players consider striking before the upcoming season began. Gibson himself had no immediate contract worries, as the $125,000 salary Gibson requested for 1969 was agreed to by team owner Gussie Busch and the Cardinals, setting a new franchise record for the highest single-season salary.

Despite the significant rule changes, Gibson&#x27;s status as one of the league&#x27;s best pitchers was not immediately affected. In 1969, he went 20–13 with a 2.18 ERA, 4 shutouts, and 28 complete games. On May 12, 1969, Gibson struck out three batters on nine pitches in the seventh inning of a 6–2 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Gibson became the ninth National League pitcher and the 15th pitcher in Major League history to throw an immaculate inning. After pitching into the tenth inning of the July 4 game against the Cubs, Gibson was removed from a game without finishing an inning for the first time in more than 60 consecutive starts, a streak spanning two years. Gibson set another mark, on August 16, when he became the third pitcher in Major League history to reach the 200-strikeout plateau in seven different seasons.

Gibson experienced an up-and-down 1970 season, marked at the low point by a July slump where he resorted to experimenting with a knuckleball for the first time in his career. Just as quickly, Gibson returned to form, starting a streak of seven wins on July 28, and pitching all 14 innings of a 5–4 win against the San Diego Padres on August 12. He would go on to win his fourth and final NL Player of the Month award for August (6–0, 2.31 ERA, 55 SO). Gibson won 23 games in 1970, and was once again named the NL Cy Young Award winner.

Gibson achieved two highlights in August 1971. On the 4th, he defeated the Giants 7–2 at Busch Memorial Stadium for his 200th career victory. Ten days later, he threw a no-hitter against the Pittsburgh Pirates, beating the eventual World Champions by a score of 11–0 at Three Rivers Stadium. Along the way, he registered 10 strikeouts, including the game&#x27;s final out. Gibson also drove in three runs, one on a fifth-inning sacrifice fly and two on an eighth-inning single, to help his own cause. The no-hitter was the first in Pittsburgh since Nick Maddox at Exposition Park in 1907; none had been pitched in the 62-year history of Three Rivers Stadium&#x27;s predecessor, Forbes Field.

Gibson started the 1972 season by going 0–5. However, he would end the season with 19 wins and recording his ninth and final 200-strikeout season. He also made his final All-Star appearance. On June 21, against the San Diego Padres, he broke Jesse Haines&#x27;s club record for most wins.

During the summer of 1974, Gibson felt hopeful he could put together a winning streak, but he continually encountered swelling in his knee. Despite his struggles, on July 17 of that season, he became the second pitcher in Major League Baseball history, after Walter Johnson, to strike out more than 3,000 batters and the first to do so in the National League; the strikeout victim was César Gerónimo of the Cincinnati Reds.

In January 1975, Gibson announced he would retire at the end of the 1975 season, admitting later on that he only continued to play baseball in order to cope with his recent divorce from his ex-wife, Charline. During his final season, Gibson went 3–10 with a 5.04 earned run average.

==Career overall==
===Statistics and achievements===
From 1963 to 1970, Gibson posted a win–loss record of 156–81, for a .658 winning percentage. He won nine Gold Glove Awards, the National League Cy Young Award in 1968 and 1970, and the National League MVP Award in 1968. His 1.12 earned run average and 13 shutouts in 1968 are both records in the live-ball era.

In his career, Gibson had a win-loss record of 251–174 with an ERA of 2.91. Across 482 games started, he pitched 56 shutouts and 255 complete games, striking out 3,117 batters in innings pitched. He holds the Cardinals franchise pitching records for wins, games started, complete games, shutouts, innings pitched, and strikeouts.

As a hitter, he had a lifetime batting average of .206 with 24 home runs and 144 runs batted in. Gibson was sometimes used by the Cardinals as a pinch-hitter, and in 1970 he hit .303 for the season in 109 at-bats, which was over 100 points higher than teammate Dal Maxvill.

Gibson is considered one of the greatest postseason pitchers in baseball history. Across three World Series and nine games started, he had a record of 7–2 with a 1.89 ERA and 92 strikeouts. He became the second player, after Sandy Koufax, to win two World Series MVP awards, receiving the honor in 1964 and 1967.

In , he set a World Series record for most strikeouts in a seven-game World Series with 31, a record he broke in when he recorded 35, including a record 17 strikeouts in Game 1. Additionally, Gibson is one of two pitchers, the other being Dave McNally, to hit two home runs in World Series play, hitting one each in the and 1968 World Series.

===Pitching style and reputation===
Gibson was a quick worker on the mound with an explosive delivery, falling towards first base each time he released the ball. He relied on pinpoint control and had a low, three-quarter arm angle. His repertoire consisted of a slider and both a two-seam fastball and a four-seam fastball.

He was a fierce competitor who was known to throw brushback pitches to establish dominance over the strike-zone and intimidate the batter, similar to his contemporary and fellow Hall of Famer Don Drysdale. However, he rarely hit batters deliberately; compared to Drysdale, who hit 154 batters in his career, Gibson hit only 102 despite facing more batters. Additionally, Drysdale led the league in hit batsmen five times, while Gibson never did; only once did he finish in the top three.

While he gained a reputation for being intimidating, Gibson often pushed back on stories by contemporaries about him as being exaggerated, saying that he made no concerted effort to be intimidating. He once joked that the only reason he glared while pitching was because of his poor eyesight and inability to see the catcher&#x27;s signals clearly as he did not wear glasses while pitching.

Gibson was also known to avoid fraternizing with opposing players. At the 1965 All-Star Game, Milwaukee Braves catcher Joe Torre caught Gibson in the 9th inning; afterwards, when he complimented Gibson&#x27;s pitching, the latter ignored him and merely got dressed and left. He could also, on occasion, be brusque with his teammates, particularly his catchers. When Tim McCarver once went to the mound for a conference, Gibson brushed him off, saying &quot;The only thing you know about pitching is that it&#x27;s hard to hit.&quot;

==Post-playing career==
Before Gibson returned to his home in Omaha at the end of the 1975 season, Cardinals general manager Bing Devine offered him an undefined job that was contingent on approval from higher-ranking club officials. Unsure of his future career path, Gibson declined the offer. The Cardinals never brought him another offer again. He would later say of the exchange: &quot;I&#x27;ve often thought how different my life would have been if I had said &#x27;yes&#x27; that day.&quot;

After his retirement, Gibson used the motor home the Cardinals had given him as a retirement gift to travel across the western United States during the 1975 offseason. Returning to Omaha, he served as chairman of the board of directors for the Community National Bank, a local bank which served the city&#x27;s African-American community. At one point the principal investor in the radio station KOWH. He also started &quot;Gibson&#x27;s Spirits and Sustenance&quot; restaurant, sometimes working twelve-hour days as its owner/operator.

Gibson returned to baseball in 1981 after accepting a coaching job with Joe Torre, who was then manager of the New York Mets. Torre termed Gibson&#x27;s position &quot;attitude coach&quot;, the first such title in Major League history. After Torre and his coaching staff were let go at the end of the 1981 season, Torre moved on to manage the Atlanta Braves in 1982, hiring Gibson as a pitching coach. The Braves proceeded to challenge for the National League pennant for the first time since 1969, ultimately losing to the Cardinals in the 1982 National League Championship Series. Gibson remained with Torre on the Braves&#x27; coaching staff until the end of the 1984 season.

Gibson then took to hosting a pre- and postgame show for Cardinals baseball games on radio station KMOX from 1985 until 1989. He also served as color commentator for baseball games on ESPN in 1990 but declined an option to continue the position over concerns he would have to spend too much time away from his family. In 1995, Gibson again served as pitching coach on a Torre-led staff, this time returning to the Cardinals.

In 2009, with the help of sportswriter Lonnie Wheeler, he and fellow Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson wrote a book titled &quot;Sixty Feet, Six Inches: A Hall of Fame Pitcher &amp; a Hall of Fame Hitter Talk About How the Game Is Played&quot;. Gibson wrote another book, also with Wheeler, titled &quot;Pitch by Pitch: My View of One Unforgettable Game&quot;; it was published in 2015 and described Game 1 of the 1968 World Series from his point of view.

==Honors==
Gibson&#x27;s jersey number 45 was retired by the St. Louis Cardinals on September 1, 1975. In 1981, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on his first ballot.

In 1999, he was ranked number 31 on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;″ list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, and was elected to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2020, &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked Gibson at number 45 on its &quot;Baseball 100&quot; list, complied by sportswriter Joe Posnanski.

Gibson was named as one of (then) thirteen &quot;Black Aces&quot;, a select few African-American pitchers who had a 20-win season in the Major Leagues, by former pitcher Mudcat Grant in a book he had authored called &quot;The Black Aces: Baseball&#x27;s Only African-American Twenty-Game Winners&quot;.

In 2022, as part of their SN Rushmore project, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; named Gibson on their &quot;St. Louis Mount Rushmore of Sports&quot;, along with fellow Cardinals Stan Musial and Albert Pujols, and St. Louis Blues hockey player Brett Hull.

He has a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame. A bronze statue of Gibson by Harry Weber is located in front of Busch Stadium, commemorating Gibson along with other St. Louis Cardinals greats. Another statue of Gibson was unveiled outside of Werner Park in Gibson&#x27;s home city, Omaha, Nebraska, in 2013. The street on the north side of Rosenblatt Stadium, former home of the College World Series in his hometown of Omaha, is named Bob Gibson Boulevard.

In January 2014, the Cardinals announced Gibson as among 22 former players and personnel who made up the inaugural class of St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum.

==Personal life==
Gibson was married twice and was the father of three children. With his first wife, Charline (née Johnson), he had a son named Ray and a daughter named Annette. With his second wife, Wendy (née Nelson), he had a son named Christopher.

During his teenage years, Gibson&#x27;s eyesight deteriorated severely and necessitated the use eyeglasses. However, he never wore glasses when in uniform or while pitching; catcher Tim McCarver would paint his finger nails to enable Gibson to be able to see signs. Gibson&#x27;s former teammate Bill White, while with the San Francisco Giants, recalled taking Gibson to meet Willie Mays; Mays did not immediately recognize Gibson as the latter was wearing his glasses at the time.

During his career and in retirement, Gibson continued to live in his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska. This was due to a discriminatory housing policy in St. Louis during his playing career which made it extremely difficult for him to buy a house in the city.

Gibson hosted an annual golf tournament in Omaha for 12 years, called the &#x27;Bob Gibson All-Star Classic&#x27;, raising millions of dollars for local and national charities. He also sat on the Board of Directors of the Baseball Assistance Team (B.A.T.), an organization that provides aid to retired, financially struggling former ballplayers.

In 2002, Gibson was involved in a road rage incident with a man named Miguel Sanchez. Both Gibson and Sanchez were cited by the police for third-degree assault after they got into a fistfight at a gas station.

===Illness and death===
In July 2019, Gibson&#x27;s longtime agent Dick Zitzmann announced that Gibson had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer several weeks earlier and was due to begin chemotherapy. He died on October 2, 2020, at age 84, under hospice care after fighting cancer for more than a year.

Following his death, Cardinal fans paid their respect to Gibson at his statue at Busch Stadium. The following season, the team honored Gibson by wearing a &quot;45&quot; memorial patch on their uniforms and holding &quot;Bob Gibson Day&quot; on August 22, with former teammates and his family attending the pregame memorial ceremony.

Gibson&#x27;s funeral was held privately in Omaha, Nebraska, with only his immediate surviving family attending. His body was interred at Evergreen Memorial Park in Omaha.

<text>Josep Trueta i Raspall (27 October 1897 – 19 January 1977) was a Catalan surgeon and researcher from Spain.

==Biography==
Born in the Poblenou neighbourhood of Barcelona, Trueta came from a progressive minded family with medical and military backgrounds (his father was a doctor, his grandfather a military officer and his great-grandfather an Army surgeon). In his youth he felt called to an artistic career, being very keen on painting, and excelled in sports like fencing, but ended up studying medicine in the University of Barcelona. In the 1920s he temporarily moved to Vienna to further his studies and it was there that he focused on the development and application of innovative techniques for bone treatments, being considered because of this one of the fathers of modern traumatology.

He started applying his methodologies for the treatment of workplace accidents, being hired as Chief Surgeon for the &quot;&quot;Caja de Previsión y Socorro&quot;, an insurance company that treated 40.000 accident victims annually. In 1934 he developed the &quot;Método Trueta&quot;&quot;, a technique for the treatment of wounded soldiers in the battlefield. His technique was initially considered too risky to be implemented in battlefield conditions and lacked support from other doctors. In 1935 he was named Director of the Surgery service at the Hospital de Sant Pau in Barcelona, a position he held during the Spanish Civil War. During the war, he applied his innovative methods and achieved a significant reduction in bone fracture related infections and a 90% reduction of gangrene cases. In 1938, having treated more than 600 battle related fractures without having to resort to a single amputation, he published his first medical text, the booklet &quot;Treatment of War Fractures&quot;.

As a Catalan nationalist, he fled into exile, first to Perpignan and from there, after being contacted by the Foreign Office, to England. In 1939 an English translation of his 1938 booklet was published as &quot;Treatment of War Wounds and Fractures, with special reference to the Closed Method as used in the war in Spain&quot;, in London. His work was noted and accepted by the British RAMC, thus influencing British Army medical practice. During World War II, he helped to organize medical emergency services. His use of a new plaster cast method for the treatment of open wounds and fractures helped save a great number of lives and still more limbs, during several wars.

Trueta formed part of a group of Catalans exiled in the United Kingdom who denounced the situation of Catalonia in Francoist Spain. He wrote &quot;The Spirit of Catalonia&quot;, a book aimed at explaining Catalan history to English-speaking society.

He joined the team run by Florey and Chain that developed penicillin in Oxford, and held the first live animal to be injected with the groundbreaking antibiotic.

From 1949 to 1966 he was the third Nuffield Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of Oxford and directed the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre (previously the Wingfield-Morris Hospital).

During his career he published 20 books and more than 200 articles not just on surgical techniques, but also on bone development, the treatment of polio or renal circulation.

On his retirement in 1966, he returned to Catalonia with his wife Amèlia. Both were buried (in 1977 and 1975 respectively) in Santa Cristina d&#x27;Aro.

The main hospital of Girona, Josep Trueta University Hospital, was named after him, as are streets in many towns across Catalonia. Every year the government of Catalonia awards Trueta medals and plaques to professionals and institutions that excel in the Catalan medical field.

<text>The plus–minus sign or plus-or-minus sign () and the complementary minus-or-plus sign () are symbols with broadly similar multiple meanings.
*In mathematics, the sign generally indicates a choice of exactly two possible values, one of which is obtained through addition and the other through subtraction.
*In statistics and experimental sciences, the sign commonly indicates the confidence interval or uncertainty bounding a range of possible errors in a measurement, often the standard deviation or standard error. The sign may also represent an inclusive range of values that a reading might have.
*In chess, the sign indicates a clear advantage for the white player; the complementary minus-plus sign () indicates a clear advantage for the black player.
Other meanings occur in other fields, including medicine, engineering, chemistry, electronics, linguistics, and philosophy.

==History==
A version of the sign, including also the French word &quot;ou&quot; (&quot;or&quot;), was used in its mathematical meaning by Albert Girard in 1626, and the sign in its modern form was used as early as 1631, in William Oughtred&#x27;s &quot;Clavis Mathematicae&quot;.

==Usage==

===In mathematics===

In mathematical formulas, the symbol may be used to indicate a symbol that may be replaced by either of the plus and minus signs, or , allowing the formula to represent two values or two equations.

If , one may give the solution as . This indicates that the equation has two solutions: and . A common use of this notation is found in the quadratic formula
:formula_1
which describes the two solutions to the quadratic equation 

Similarly, the trigonometric identity
:formula_2
can be interpreted as a shorthand for two equations: one with on both sides of the equation, and one with on both sides.
The minus–plus sign, , is generally used in conjunction with the sign, in such expressions as , which can be interpreted as meaning or (but or ). The always has the opposite sign to .

The above expression can be rewritten as to avoid use of , but cases such as the trigonometric identity are most neatly written using the &quot;∓&quot; sign:
:formula_3
which represents the two equations:
:formula_4

Another example is the conjugate of the perfect squares
:formula_5
which represents the two equations:
:formula_6

A related usage is found in this presentation of the formula for the Taylor series of the sine function:
:formula_7
Here, the plus-or-minus sign indicates that the term may be added or subtracted depending on whether is odd or even; a rule which can be deduced from the first few terms. A more rigorous presentation would multiply each term by a factor of , which gives +1 when is even, and −1 when is odd. In older texts one occasionally finds , which means the same.

When the standard presumption that the plus-or-minus signs all take on the same value of +1 or all −1 is not true, then the line of text that immediately follows the equation must contain a brief description of the actual connection, if any, most often of the form &quot;where the ‘±’ signs are independent&quot; or similar. If a brief, simple description is not possible, the equation must be re-written to provide clarity; e.g. by introducing variables such as , , ... and specifying a value of +1 or −1 separately for each, or some appropriate relation, like or similar.

===In statistics===
The use of for an approximation is most commonly encountered in presenting the numerical value of a quantity, together with its tolerance or its statistical margin of error. For example, may be anywhere in the range from 5.5 to 5.9 inclusive. In scientific usage, it sometimes refers to a probability of being within the stated interval, usually corresponding to either 1 or 2 standard deviations (a probability of 68.3% or 95.4% in a normal distribution).

Operations involving uncertain values should always try to preserve the uncertainty, in order to avoid propagation of error. If , any operation of the form must return a value of the form , where is and is the range updated using interval arithmetic.

===In chess===
The symbols and are used in chess annotation to denote a moderate but significant advantage for White and Black, respectively. Weaker and stronger advantages are denoted by and for only a slight advantage, and and for a strong, potentially winning advantage, again for White and Black respectively.

===Other meanings===
*In medicine, it may mean &quot;with or without&quot; in some cases.
*In engineering, the sign indicates the tolerance, which is the range of values that are considered to be acceptable or safe, or which comply with some standard or with a contract.
*In chemistry, the sign is used to indicate a racemic mixture.
*In electronics, this sign may indicate a dual voltage power supply, such as ±5 volts means +5 volts and −5 volts, when used with audio circuits and operational amplifiers.
*In linguistics, it may indicate a distinctive feature, such as [±voiced].

==Encodings==
*In Unicode: 
*In ISO 8859-1, -7, -8, -9, -13, -15, and -16, the plus–minus symbol is code 0xB1hex. This location was copied to Unicode.
*In HTML, the symbol also has character entity reference representations of codice_1, codice_2
*The rarer minus–plus sign is not generally found in legacy encodings, but is available in Unicode as so can be used in HTML using codice_3 or codice_4.
*In TeX &#x27;plus-or-minus&#x27; and &#x27;minus-or-plus&#x27; symbols are denoted codice_5 and codice_6, respectively.
*Although these characters may be approximated by underlining or overlining a symbol (   or  ), this is discouraged because the formatting may be stripped at a later date, changing the meaning. It also makes the meaning less accessible to blind users with screen readers.

===Typing===
*Windows: or (numbers typed on the numeric keypad).
*Macintosh: (equal sign on the non-numeric keypad).
*Unix-like systems: or (second works on Chromebook)
* In the Vim text editor (in Insert mode): or or or 
* AutoCAD shortcut string: 

==Similar characters==

The plus–minus sign resembles the Chinese characters (Radical 32) and (Radical 33), whereas the minus–plus sign resembles (Radical 51).

<text>Ann Bancroft (born September 29, 1955) is an American author, teacher, adventurer, and public speaker. She was the first woman to finish a number of expeditions to the Arctic and Antarctic. She was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1995.

==Biography==
Bancroft was born in Mendota Heights, Minnesota, and grew up in St. Paul, Minnesota. Bancroft spent two years in Kenya in her fifth and sixth grades. Bancroft began leading wilderness expeditions when she was 8 years old when she convinced her cousins to join her on backyard expeditions. She described her family as one of risk takers. Bancroft struggled with dyslexia from an early age, but she nevertheless graduated from high school and was accepted at the University of Oregon where she graduated with a Physical Education Degree in 1981. Bancroft was a camper and staff member at YMCA Camp Widjiwagan in Ely, MN. Bancroft also taught Physical Education and Special Education in St. Paul and Minneapolis, Minnesota. Bancroft became a wilderness instructor and a gym teacher in Minneapolis (at Clara Barton Open School) and St. Paul.

Bancroft founded the Ann Bancroft Foundation in 1991 &quot;to support the educational mission of the historic all-women&#x27;s Antarctic polar expedition in 1993&quot;
The Ann Bancroft foundation supports the Wilderness Inquiry group and Bancroft currently teaches at Wilderness Inquiry. The Wilderness Inquiry group allows individuals and families to go on outdoor adventures, and the adventures are open to people of all ability levels. Bancroft currently co-owns an exploration company, Bancroft Arnesen Explore, with Liv Arnesen. Bancroft has been on expeditions on the Ganges River in India, crossed Greenland, traveled to the North Pole, and crossed the South Pole.

==Expeditions==
Bancroft gave up her physical education and special education teaching posts in 1986 in order to participate with the &quot;Will Steger International North Pole Expedition&quot;. She arrived at the North Pole together with five other team members after 56 days using dogsleds. This made Bancroft the first woman to reach the North Pole on foot and by sled.

She was also the first woman to cross both polar ice caps to reach the North and South Poles. In 1992–1993, Bancroft led a four-woman expedition to the South Pole on skis; this expedition was the first all-female expedition to cross the ice to the South Pole.

In 2001, Bancroft and Norwegian adventurer Liv Arnesen became the first women to ski across Antarctica.

In March 2007, Bancroft and Liv Arnesen took part in a trek across the Arctic Ocean to draw attention to the problem of global warming. The two explorers were followed be millions of school children. However, according to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the expedition was called off &quot;after Liv Arnesen suffered frostbite in three of her toes, and extreme cold temperatures drained the batteries in some of their electronic equipment.&quot;

In 2017, Bancroft led an expedition on the Ganges River as part of the &quot;Access Water Initiative Series.&quot; The Ganges River expedition&#x27;s purpose was to raise awareness of the importance of clean water and that waste will travel downstream. This expedition was a 60-day trip on 1,500 miles of waterway.

Bancroft planned to boat down the Mississippi River in 2018 with Arnesen and other female explorers. Future expeditions will be conducted on every continent. This initiative aims to encourage children to protect their waterways, which is a vital resource. In 2018, Bancroft will paddle down the 2,320 mile Mississippi River. Future trips include Africa in 2019, Oceania in 2021, South America in 2023, Europe in 2025, and Antarctica in 2027.

==Activist==
Bancroft is openly bisexual and in 2006, she publicly campaigned against a proposed amendment to the Minnesota Constitution to prohibit any legal recognition of marriages or civil unions between members of the same sex.

Bancroft also supports awareness of Access Water, Winter Warm-Up challenges, and global warming.

<text>The German Life Saving Association ( or DLRG) is a relief organization for life saving in Germany. The DLRG is the largest voluntary lifesaving organization in the world.

With around 560,000 members, organised in approximately 2,100 local groups, the DLRG is the largest voluntary water rescue organization in the world. More than one million regular donors support the work of the DLRG.

==Tasks==
The most urgent goal of the DLRG is the creation and promotion of all activities used to fight drowning. Additional tasks are:

*Teach swimming and self-rescue to the public
*Educate people about the dangers of swimming and how to avoid them
*Teach and train rescue swimming
*Basic and advanced training in First Aid
*Help and technical safety support for water related activities
*Providing lifeguards at public places
*Perform rescue related exercises and water sports competitions
*Environmental protection at, on and in waters.
*Cooperation with German civil defense, especially concerning floods.
*International Response Units

<doc id="367239" wikidata="Q1072109" url="?curid=367239" title="Ferruginous hawk">
<text>The ferruginous hawk (Buteo regalis) is a large bird of prey and belongs to the broad-winged buteo hawks. An old colloquial name is ferrugineous rough-leg, due to its similarity to the closely related rough-legged hawk (&quot;B. lagopus&quot;).

The generic name &quot;buteo&quot; is Latin for &#x27;buzzard&#x27;. The specific epithet &quot;regalis&quot; is Latin for &#x27;royal&#x27; (from &quot;rex, regis&quot;, &#x27;king&#x27;). The common name &#x27;ferruginous&#x27; means &#x27;rust-colored&#x27; or &#x27;reddish-brown&#x27;.

This species is a large, broad-winged hawk of the open, arid grasslands, prairie and shrub steppe country; it is endemic to the interior parts of North America. It is used as a falconry bird in its native ranges.

==Description==
This is the largest of the North American &quot;Buteos&quot; and is often mistaken for an eagle due to its size, proportions, and behavior. Among all the nearly thirty species of &quot;Buteo&quot; in the world, only the upland buzzard (&quot;B. hemilasius&quot;) of Asia averages larger in length and wingspan. The weight of the upland buzzard and ferruginous broadly overlaps and which of these two species is the heaviest in the genus is debatable. As with all birds of prey, the female ferruginous hawk is larger than the male, but there is some overlap between small females and large males in the range of measurements. Length in this species ranges from with an average of , wingspan from , with an average of about , and weight from . Weight varies in the species relatively restricted breeding range. In the southern reaches of the species breeding range, i.e. Arizona, New Mexico and Utah, males average , in a sample of fifteen, and females average , in a sample of four. In the northern stretches of the breeding range, in southern Canada, Washington, Idaho and North Dakota, the hawks are heavier averaging in males (from a sample of 30) and in females (from a sample of 37). Upland buzzard average weights were intermediate between those body mass surveys, notably heavier than the first and less heavier than the latter one, particularly the sample of 37 ferruginous hawk females place it as the most massive type of &quot;Buteo&quot; in northern populations.

Adults have long broad wings and a broad gray, rusty, or white tail. The legs are feathered to the talons, like the rough-legged hawk. There are two color forms:
* Light morph birds are rusty brown on the upper parts and pale on the head, neck, and underparts with rust on the legs and some rust marking on the underwing. The upper wings are grey. The &quot;ferruginous&quot; name refers to the rusty color of the light-morph birds.
* Dark-morph birds are dark brown on both upperparts and underparts with light areas on the upper and lower wings.

There are no subspecies.

===Voice===
The voice is not well-described in literature. Alarm calls consist of &quot;kree – a&quot; or &quot;ke – ah&quot; and harsh &quot;kaah, kaah&quot; calls, the latter resembling some vocalizations of the herring gull. One description referred to the &quot;wavering&quot; alarm call and &quot;breathy&quot; notes, while other authors describe screams similar to those of the red-tailed hawk (&quot;B. jamaicensis&quot;).

===Identification===

The male and female have identical markings. The main difference is size, with the female being somewhat larger. Perched birds have a white breast and body with dark legs. The back and wings are a brownish rust color. The head is white with a dark streak extending behind the eye. The wingtips almost reach the tip of the tail.

The underside is primarily light colored with the dark legs forming a &quot;V&quot; shape. The reddish upper-back color extends to the inner wing-coverts or &quot;shoulders.&quot; The primary remiges (pinions) are dark gray with conspicuous light &quot;windows&quot; in the inner primaries. Three prominent light areas on the upper surface stand out as two &quot;windows&quot; on the outer wings and a rufous rump mark, perhaps the most significant feature of a flying ferruginous hawk. The underwings are whitish overall with rufous markings, particularly in the patagial area. This gives a smudgy appearance to the wings, but less dark than in a red-tailed hawk. The ferruginous hawk is noticeably longer winged than a red-tailed hawk, although the wings appear slenderer than the latter species the total wing area of the ferruginous is considerably more. However, the Red-tail can be nearly as bulky and heavy. Dark &quot;comma&quot;-shaped markings are prominent at the wrists. The ferruginous hawk is one of the only two hawks that have feathers that cover their legs down to their toes, like the golden eagle. The other is the rough-legged buzzard (&quot;Buteo lagopus&quot;). The pale morph of the closely related but more slender rough-legged species is best distinguished by its darker coloration, with a broad black tail band and a dark band across the chest. The dark morph Rough-leg is more a slaty coloration than the more brownish dark morph ferruginous. Swainson&#x27;s hawks and especially rough-legged buzzards can be nearly as long-winged but are less bulky and heavily built than the ferruginous. Among the normal standard measurements, the wing chord measures , the tarsus measures and the tail measures . Additionally, the grasp is and the third toe , indicating that the ferruginous hawks has the largest and most robust feet of any of the world&#x27;s &quot;Buteos&quot;. Compared to other &quot;Buteos&quot;, the ferruginous has a larger bill, at , with a much wider gap when the bill is opened, at .

In-flight, these birds soar with their wings in a dihedral. 
==Habitat==
The preferred habitat for ferruginous hawks are the arid and semiarid grassland regions of North America. The countryside is open, level, or rolling prairies; foothills or middle elevation plateaus largely devoid of trees; and cultivated shelterbelts or riparian corridors. Rock outcrops, shallow canyons, and gullies may characterize some habitats. These hawks avoid high elevations, forest interiors, narrow canyons, and cliff areas.

During the breeding season, the preference is for grasslands, sagebrush, and other arid shrub country. Nesting occurs in the open areas or in trees including cottonwoods, willows, and swamp oaks along waterways. Cultivated fields and modified grasslands are avoided during the breeding period. The density of ferruginous hawks in grasslands declines in an inverse relationship to the degree of cultivation of the grasslands. However, high densities have been reported in areas where nearly 80% of the grassland was under cultivation.

The winter habitat is similar to that used during the summer. However, cultivated areas are not necessarily avoided, particularly when the crops are not plowed under after harvest. The standing stubble provides habitat for the small-mammal prey base needed by ferruginous and other hawks. One requisite of the habitat is perches such as poles, lone trees, fence posts, hills, rocky outcrops or large boulders. Ferruginous hawks nest in trees if they are available, including riparian strips, but the presence of water does not appear to be critical to them.

The ferruginous hawk maintains minimum distances from other nesting raptors but will nest closer when necessary, suggesting that the distance is not fixed. The &quot;nearest neighbor&quot; distance has varied from less than to as much as with an average of . Nests facing different hunting territories are tolerated much closer than nests facing the same hunting territory. The minimum distance between nests is probably about one half mile on densely occupied areas. Nesting densities in several studies have varied from one pair per . In Alberta, on one study site, there was a stable density of one pair per , on average with little deviation from this mean. In Idaho, the average home range for four pairs of ferruginous hawk in the Snake River area was slightly over .

==Behavior==

The flight of the ferruginous hawk is active, with slow wing beats much like that of a small eagle. Soaring with the wings held in a strong dihedral has been noted, as well as gliding with the wings held flat, or in a modified dihedral. Hovering and low cruising over the ground are also used as hunting techniques. The wing beat has been described as &quot;fluid&quot; by some observers.


== Dietary biology ==
The ferruginous hawk primarily hunts small to medium-sized mammals but will also take birds, reptiles, and some insects. Mammals generally comprise 80–90% of the prey items or biomass in the diet with birds being the next most common mass component.

=== Method of predation ===
These birds search for prey while flying over open country or from a perch. They may also wait in ambush outside the prey&#x27;s burrow. Hunting may occur at any time of the day depending upon the activity patterns of the major prey species. A bimodal pattern of early morning and late afternoon hunting may be common. The hunting tactics can be grouped into seven basic strategies:
*Perch and Wait – perching is on any elevated natural or man-made site
*Ground Perching – the hawk will stand on the ground at a rodent burrow after initially locating it from the air. As the burrowing animal reaches the surface, the hawk rises into the air and pounces upon it even while it is still underneath the loose earth.
*Low-level Flight – birds will course over the landscape within a few yards of the ground and pursue in direct, low-level chases, or they will hunt from above the ground.
*High-level Flight – birds will hunt while soaring, but the success rate is generally low.
*Hovering – using quickened wing beats, often in times of increased winds, the birds will search the ground and drop on the prey.
*Cooperative Hunting – mates have been known to assist each other.
*Piracy – the ferruginous hawk has been observed gathering around a hunter shooting prairie dogs, and claiming shot &quot;dogs&quot; by flying to them and mantling over them.
In its &quot;strike, kill, and consume&quot; type of predation, the prey is seized with the feet and a series of blows may be meted out, including driving the rear talon into the body to puncture vital organs. Biting with the beak may also take place. Before bringing prey to the nest, the adults will often eat the head. At the nest, birds are plucked and mammals torn into pieces before being fed to the young. Food caching has been noted, but not generally near the nest.

=== Prey species ===
The diet varies somewhat geographically, depending upon the distribution of prey species, but where the range of the ferruginous hawk overlaps, rabbits and hares are major food species along with ground squirrels and pocket gophers. In South Dakota, thirteen-lined ground squirrels (&quot;Spermophilus tridecemlin&quot;) are dominant prey, while northern pocket gophers (&quot;Thomomys talpoides&quot;) and Great Basin pocket mice (&quot;Perognathus parvus&quot;) was predominantly taken in Washington. Similarly, Botta&#x27;s pocket gophers (&quot;Thomomys bottae&quot;) was important prey in New Mexico along with Gunnison&#x27;s prairie dogs (&quot;Cynomys gunnisoni&quot;) and desert cottontails (&quot;Sylvilagus audubonii&quot;). Black-tailed prairie dogs (&quot;Cynomys ludovicianus&quot;) were the only prey observed captured by ferruginous hawks during winter in Colorado, where remaining prey was either scavenged or kleptoparasitized. Richardson’s ground squirrel (&quot;Urocitellus richardsonii&quot;) was the dominant prey item in ferruginous hawk diets in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan. In the northwest Texas panhandle, the Oklahoma panhandle, and northeastern New Mexico in 2003–2004, ferruginous hawks primarily delivered plains pocket gophers (&quot;Geomys bursarius&quot;) and yellow-faced pocket gophers (&quot;Cratogeomys castanops&quot;). Larger black-tailed jackrabbits (&quot;Lepus californicus&quot;) is the main prey in Northern Utah and Southern Idaho, comprising 83% of the total biomass. These jackrabbits can weigh around , though young individuals are largely taken along with adults. Similarly, they can even regularly hunt young white-tailed jackrabbits (&quot;Lepus townsendii&quot;), one of the largest lagomorphs in North America, and adults weighing around can be infrequently taken. In one instant, a pair of ferruginous hawks succeeds at killing a large jackrabbit about in weight. Other lagomorph and rodent prey include various mouse such as eastern deer mice (&quot;Peromyscus maniculatus&quot;), voles such as montane voles (&quot;Microtus montanus&quot;), Townsend&#x27;s ground squirrels (&quot;Urocitellus townsendii&quot;), western pocket gophers (&quot;Thomomys mazama&quot;), muskrats (&quot;Ondatra zibethicus&quot;), eastern cottontails (&quot;Sylvilagus floridanus&quot;), giant kangaroo rats (&quot;Dipodomys ingens&quot;), and antelope squirrels (&quot;Ammospermophilus&quot;). Mammalian prey other than lagomorphs and rodents are uncommon, though they occasionally prey on mustelids, such as stoats (&quot;Mustela erminea&quot;), long-tailed weasels (&quot;Neogale frenata&quot;), and black-footed ferrets (&quot;Mustela nigripes&quot;).

Ferruginous hawks can also take a wide range of birds as prey. The most frequently taken avian species are western meadowlark (&quot;Sturnella neglecta&quot;) and horned larks (&quot;Eremophila alpestris&quot;) along with other passerines, and dabbing ducks can be important prey at times. They can occasionally prey on relatively large gamebirds such as common pheasants (&quot;Phasianus colchicus&quot;), lesser prairie-chickens (&quot;Tympanuchus pallidicinctus&quot;), sharp-tailed grouses (&quot;Tympanuchus phasianellus&quot;), and sage grouses (&quot;Centrocercus urophasianus&quot;). Predation on corvids such as American crows (&quot;Corvus brachyrhynchos&quot;), common raven (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;), Chihuahuan ravens (&quot;C.cryptoleucus&quot;) and raptors such as burrowing owls (&quot;Athene cunicularia&quot;), barn owls (&quot;Tyto alba&quot;), and other &quot;Buteo&quot; hawks have been reported.

Reptiles can be taken as additional prey, mainly snakes but can include lizards such as Texas horned lizards (&quot;Phrynosoma cornutum&quot;). While yellow-bellied racer (&quot;Coluber constrictor&quot;) and garter snake (&quot;Thamnophis sirtalis&quot;) was constituted the second most frequent prey item in Washington, other snakes such as western hognose snakes (&quot;Heterodon nasicus&quot;) and pine snakes (&quot;Pituophis melanoleucus&quot;) can be taken in other regions. Other preys include frogs and large insects such as grasshoppers.

=== Interspecific interaction ===
Conflicts over territories, food and nest-defense have been reported with several other large species of raptor and corvid, such as the great horned (&quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;) and short-eared owl (&quot;Asio flammeus&quot;), hen harrier (&quot;Circus cyaneus&quot;), red-tailed and Swainson&#x27;s hawks (&quot;Buteo swainsonii&quot;), golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;), accipiters (&quot;Accipiter&quot;), ravens (&quot;Corvus&quot;), and magpies (&quot;Pica&quot;). Among native raptorial birds, only larger eagles and similarly sized great horned owls can regularly outmatch this large and powerful hawk. While bald eagles (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;) normally only harass ferruginous hawks to pirate food from them, the golden eagle can be a serious threat (in potential territorial or defensive conflicts) and predator of the ferruginous. Although they may be attracted to similar nesting habitat, in a local comparison in northwestern Texas, southwestern Oklahoma and northeastern Arizona, the typical prey taken by Swainson&#x27;s hawks was quite different, being about half the weight of that of the ferruginous hawk and more focused on insects rather than mammals. However, in the Morley Nelson Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area, the prey taken by red-tailed hawks and ferruginous hawks was almost exactly the same, both in terms of species and body size. The prey species hunted by golden eagles are often similar, but the ferruginous hawk is locally less of lagomorphs where it co-exists with eagles and takes typically smaller prey, such as pocket gophers, which are generally ignored by the eagles. It seems to be quite tolerant of conspecifics from adjacent territories.

===Reproduction and life history===
Copulation occurs during and after nest building. The egg-laying period varies with latitude, weather, and possibly food supply. In the Canadian parts of the range, laying occurs from the latter part of April through late June, whereas farther south laying occurs from about March 20 through mid May. The earliest recorded clutch was in January in Utah and laying could occur as late as July 3 in Canada. Egg-laying occurs at two-day intervals with incubation starting when the first egg is laid. Incubation is shared by both sexes with each taking approximately the same number of shifts during the 32-day average incubation period. Replacement clutches following failure appears to be rare.

Courtship flights seem to be limited in the accepted sense. Both sexes engage in high, circling flight but literature details are sketchy. Soaring activities may primarily be variations on territorial defense flights as opposed to courtship per se. The &quot;flutter-glide&quot; flight consists of a series of shallow, rapid wing beats interspersed with brief glides and may serve to advertise the territory. The &quot;sky-dance&quot; is stimulated by an intruder and consists of slow flight with deep, labored wing beats with irregular yawing and pitching that may terminate in steep dives. In the &quot;follow-soar&quot; maneuver, the male ferruginous hawk will fly below an intruder and escort it out of the territory.

High perching occurs from prominent places around the nest, particularly early in the breeding cycle. Aggressive actions such as attacking, talon-grasping, and pursuit have been noted by some observers. Copulation begins before construction of the new nest, and increases in frequency until the start of egg laying. The passing of food may occur before the activity. The duration of copulation is from four to 18 seconds.
The ferruginous hawk is one of the most adaptable nesters of the raptors, and will use trees, ledges, rock or dirt outcrops, the ground, haystacks, nest platforms, power poles, and other man-made structures. Within some broad categories such as cliffs, the variety includes clay, dirt and rock substrates. Tree nests are typically in isolated trees or isolated clumps of trees in exposed locations. Authors differ as to whether ground nests are more successful than tree nests, but they are more susceptible to mammalian predation. Nest locations are reused frequently, but several nests may be built in an area. Typically, one or two alternate nests may exist but up to eight have been found on some territories.

The nests are made of ground debris such as sticks, branches, and cattails. Old nests will be refurbished, or nests of other species may be taken over and refurbished with sticks being added on top of the old nests. Odd items such as paper, rubbish, barbed wire, cornstalks, plastic, and steel cable have been incorporated into nests. Bark from trees and shrubs will be used for lining along with grasses and cow dung. Bits and pieces of greenery are often added to the nest. Prior to the removal of the bison from this bird&#x27;s range, nesting material often included bison bones, fur and dung. Both sexes are involved with building the nests and bringing materials, but the male seems to be more involved in retrieving materials while the female arranges them in the structure.
Clutch size varies from one to eight and is likely linked to food supply. The average clutch is three to four eggs, each long and wide. They are smooth, non-glossy and whitish in color, irregularly spotted or speckled and blotched with reddish-brown markings. There may be a concentration of darker pigments at the small end of the egg. Occasionally, the eggs are almost unmarked or have faint scribblings on them.

The nestling period varies from 38 to 50 days with brooding primarily by the female. Males fledge at 38 to 40 days and the females as late as 50 days after hatching, or 10 days later than their male siblings as they take longer to develop. Nestlings lie or sit for the first two weeks, stand at about three weeks and walk soon after. By 16 or 18 days, they are able to feed on their own. Wing flapping starts about day 23 and by day 33 the young are capable of vigorous flapping and &quot;flap jumps.&quot; The nestlings are sensitive to high temperatures and seek shade however possible in the nest.
Initial movement out of the nest is felt to be a response to heat stress as the young quickly move towards shade. The initial flight for the males is taken at 38 to 40 days while the slower-developing females fly about 10 days later. Post-fledging dependency upon the parents may last for several weeks. During the first four weeks after fledging, the young patrol increasingly large areas around the nest as they learn to hunt. Young hawks have killed prey as early as four days after fledging.

The ferruginous hawk is single-brooded, and as in so many raptors, the number of young reared is tied closely to food supply. In areas where jackrabbit populations are the principal food source, the initial clutch sizes and the number of reared young vary closely with variations in the number of jackrabbits. Fifty percent loss of young has been reported in low jackrabbit years. Fledging rates of 2.7 to 3.6 young per nest have been reported during years of abundant food supply. The high potential clutch size allows for a quick response to increases in the prey base.

Ferruginous hawks have been known to live for 20 years in the wild, but most birds probably die within the first five years. The oldest banded birds were recovered at age 20. First-year mortality has been estimated at 66% and the adult mortality at 25%. The reasons for mortality include illegal shooting, loss of a satisfactory food supply, harassment, predation, and starvation of nestlings during times of low food supply. Ground nests are susceptible to predation by coyotes, bobcats and mountain lions while nestlings, fledglings and adults may be preyed upon by great horned owls, red-tailed hawks, bald eagles and golden eagles.

==Status and conservation==
At times the ferruginous hawk has been considered threatened, endangered, or of concern on various threatened species lists but recent population increases in local areas, coupled with conservation initiatives, have created some optimism about the bird&#x27;s future. It was formerly classified as a Near Threatened species by the IUCN, but new research has confirmed that the Ferruginous hawk is common and widespread again. Consequently, it was downlisted to Least Concern status in 2008.

Declines are mostly due to loss of quality habitat. Although flexible in choosing a nest site and exhibiting a high reproductive potential, this bird&#x27;s restriction to natural grasslands on the breeding grounds and specialized predation on mammals persecuted on rangelands may make conservation a continuous concern. Historically, the birds entirely disappeared from areas where agriculture displaced the natural flora and fauna; for example it was noted in 1916 that the species was &quot;practically extinct&quot; in San Mateo County, California. Studies have found that prairie dogs can be a main prey item for ferruginous hawks, linking them to the populations of prairie dog towns in the mid-west and southwestern United States, which have been declining in recent years. This bird may also be sensitive to the use of pesticides on farms; they are also frequently shot. Threats to the overall population include:
* cultivation of native prairie grassland and subsequent habitat loss
* tree invasion of northern grassland habitats
* reductions in food supply due to agricultural pest management programs
* shooting and human interference

The ferruginous hawk was on the National Audubon Society&#x27;s &quot;Blue List&quot; of species felt to be declining. From 1971 to 1981 it retained its &quot;blue&quot; status, and from 1982 to 1986 it was listed as a species of &quot;Special Concern.&quot; The United States Fish and Wildlife Service placed it in a category of &quot;undetermined&quot; in 1973, and various states have placed it in categories of &quot;Threatened&quot; or &quot;Endangered.&quot; In Canada, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada considered this species &quot;Threatened&quot; in 1980.

Across the Canadian prairies, the range was diminishing up until 1980, and at that time, birds were felt to be occupying 48% of its original range. Numbers were generally felt to be diminishing and a total Canadian population was estimated at 500 to 1000 pairs. By 1987, population increases were being noted, and the Alberta population alone was estimated at 1,800 pairs. The upswing was likely due to a greater availability of food on the wintering grounds, making the birds more likely to breed when they returned to Canada. In the United States, there has been a history of concern for this species in many states with declines noted, but in 1988, one study suggested that the population in California and locally elsewhere may have increased significantly. The wintering population north of Mexico was estimated at 5,500 birds in 1986. In 1984, the population estimate for North America was between 3,000 and 4,000 pairs, and in 1987, it was 14,000 individuals.

Toxic chemicals have not been suggested as a significant threat to the ferruginous hawk. Management strategies must include the retention or reclamation of native grasslands for breeding as well as on the wintering grounds. Maintenance of high populations of prey species in wintering areas seems critical to the hawks&#x27; abilities to move onto the summer range in breeding condition. The integration of agricultural practices and policies into the management strategies is a crucial component of any overall scheme for conservation. The provision of nesting platforms has had positive effects and should be a part of local strategies. Public education and the elimination of persecution and human disturbance must be an important part of the overall conservation program.

==Use in falconry==

The ferruginous hawk is a well-regarded falconry bird, though not recommended for beginners due to its large size, power, and aggressive personality. For the experienced falconer it offers an opportunity to experience the nearest equivalent to hunting with the golden eagle with much lower risk of injury to the falconer by the hawk. Faster and stronger than the red-tailed hawk, the ferruginous hawk is effective in pursuit of larger hares and jackrabbits that are difficult prey for the red-tailed hawk and Harris&#x27;s hawk, and with its agility is also more effective on large bird species than is the golden eagle.

<text>Ilium is an Australian melodic power metal band formed in Newcastle in 1998 as Iliad. Founding mainstay is guitarist-songwriter, Jason Hodges. Upon Adam Smith (ex-Oracle) joining on guitar they changed their name and have released eight studio albums; &quot;Sirens of the Styx&quot; (18 December 2003), &quot;Permian Dusk&quot; (25 November 2005), &quot;Vespertilion&quot; (17 April 2007), &quot;Ageless Decay&quot; (22 June 2009), &quot;Genetic Memory&quot; (26 August 2011), &quot;My Misanthropia&quot; (14 March 2015), &quot;Sirens of the Styx: Re-Styxed&quot; (25 October 2017) and &quot;Carcinogeist&quot; (28 February 2020).

==History==

===Founding and early years: 1998–2002===
Ilium were founded in Newcastle by former members of local power metal band, Oracle, with guitarist-songwriter Jason Hodges and vocalist Mark Snedden initially as Iliad in 1998. Hodges and Snedden were school friends and had formed Oracle in 1990. Iliad also included later Oracle members: Kris Arendse on guitar and Michael Noonan on bass guitar; as well as session musician, David Pearson on drums. They recorded a six-track demo which the band&#x27;s website described as &quot;ill-fated from the start, with an inappropriate producer and the band&#x27;s lack of studio experience, coupled with plaguing health problems, the results were truly horrible&quot;. Hodges listed the group&#x27;s inspirations as &quot;Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Helloween, Rage, Blind Guardian, Gamma Ray, Rush, Megadeth, Coroner, Scorpions, Rainbow, Ozzy Osbourne, [and] Dio&quot;.

Late in 1998 with the introduction of Adam Smith, also ex-Oracle, on guitar the group changed its name to Ilium. In 2002 they recorded a four-track eponymous extended play with Dungeon&#x27;s vocalist and guitarist Lord Tim (aka Tim Grose) producing and adding backing vocals. Noonan left during recording sessions and Smith completed the bass guitar work. The EP included a cover version of Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;The Green Manalishi (With the Two Prong Crown)&quot; in the vogue of Judas Priest&#x27;s 1979 version. The other tracks were &quot;Half-Life&quot;, &quot;Semblance&quot; and &quot;Antigone&quot; – the first two were solely written by Hodges, while the latter was co-written with Smith and Sneddon. Yet another ex-Oracle, Matthew Woodland, joined Ilium shortly before its release. The EP gained the attention of several labels, including Sentinel Steel boss Denis Gulbey, with Italian record company Adrenaline&#x27;s metal label Steelheart signing the band.

===&quot;Sirens of the Styx&quot;: 2003–2004===
On 18 December 2003 Ilium issued their debut album, &quot;Sirens of the Styx&quot;, with Lord Tim producing again and Steve Moore providing drums. It included three tracks from &quot;Ilium&quot;, as well as &quot;Incipience: Beowulf Defeats Grendel&quot;, which is part one of a trilogy centred on the Beowulf and Grendel legends. Parts two and three appeared on their third release. &quot;Incipience&quot; was written by Hodges, Smith, Snedden and Noonan. Another track, &quot;The Celestial Sphere&quot;, written by Hodges, Smith and Snedden, became Ilium&#x27;s first music video. Daniel Böhm from German metal magazine, &quot;Rock Hard&quot;, found the album &quot;sounds wonderfully wrong-headed&quot;. After recording the album, Peter Gilchrist joined on bass guitar, while drummer David Walmsley joined shortly thereafter.

Snedden left in July due to family and financial restraints, Lord Tim was recruited in his place, originally to complete the recording sessions but soon became a full-time member. Gilchrist and Walmsley both left Ilium at the end of 2003, Gilchrist was recorded on the demo tracks but bass guitar on the album was provided by Smith, with Walmsley completing his drum duties on the album before exiting. Tim&#x27;s vocal style which was in tune with Smith and Hodges&#x27; vision, which helped Ilium garner international praise, whilst the production duties were taken over largely by Hodges and Smith. Late in 2004, Gilchrist and Walmsley rejoined Ilium, and Gilchrist&#x27;s 15-year-old son Corey joined on keyboards, with his vocals providing extra body to their live performances. Corey Gilchrist auditioned to appear on the TV talent show, &quot;Australian Idol&quot;, and twice reached the top 100 but did not progress.

===&quot;Permian Dusk&quot;: 2005–2006===
Ilium&#x27;s second album, &quot;Permian Dusk&quot;, was released on 25 November 2005. Walmsley left again as the album was being mastered and was replaced on drums by Dungeon&#x27;s Tim Yatras. In October Corey was hit by a train and his foot was amputated, which forced both he and his father out of the band. Corey recovered and later appeared on &quot;Australian Idol&quot; getting into the semi-finals.

&quot;Permian Dusk&quot; received a positive review from &quot;Rock Hard&quot;, which gave it a score of 9.5/10 and led their reviewer, Wolfram Küper, to declare it as the best power metal album of the year. AllMusic&#x27;s Stewart Mason felt it avoided the &quot;more annoying aspects of modern metal&quot;, where Tim&#x27;s vocals showed &quot;oddly perfect diction and haughty delivery of an old-school metal singer&quot; and the rest of the band &quot;plays it fast and melodic, with clean-sounding chorused guitars riffing&quot;. The group provided a music video for &quot;Chloroform Divinity&quot;, which was co-written by Hodges and Smith. In November 2006, it was announced that Swedish keyboardist Kaspar Dahlqvist, a former member of various bands including Dionysus, Stormwind, Treasureland and Circle II Circle, had joined the Ilium line-up, though personal issues have meant that he was unable to continue with the band.

===&quot;Vespertilion&quot;: 2007–2008===
Ilium issued their third album, &quot;Vespertilion&quot;, on 17 April 2007, which received positive reviews. It included the next two instalments of their Beowulf trilogy with part two, &quot;Desinence: Beowulf and the Serpent&quot;, and part three, &quot;Beowulf: The Peroration&quot;, both co-written by Hodges, Smith and Snedden.

&quot;Rock Hard&quot;″s Küper rated it at 8.0/10, he found it provided &quot;a partly majestic, partly mystic atmosphere&quot; with the sound of &quot;melody, hardness and independence&quot;. Paul Batteiger of The Metal Crypt website noted they &quot;tend to write really long songs that are just a little bit proggy without straying out of pure metal territory – they don&#x27;t overuse keys, they don&#x27;t go nuts with the solos, they just write long songs filled with heavy riffs&quot;.

Despite many reviews crediting Dahlqvist as keyboardist, it was Smith who played keyboards along with guitar and bass guitar. In November that year Lord Tim announced his departure from Ilium.

===&quot;Ageless Decay&quot;: 2009–2010===
The release of &quot;Ageless Decay&quot; in June 2009 brought outstanding reviews from the metal music scene in Europe. The album features vocals by New Yorks Mike DiMeo which takes this band&#x27;s music to places they have never been before. Surprisingly the band is largely unknown in its home country of Australia.

Significant changes for the album Ageless Decay are the artwork by Dimitar Nikolov and the mixing and mastering by Tommy Hansen. The team of Hodges and Smith continue to gain attention to their songwriting abilities. Ageless Decay is distributed by Escape Music.

===&quot;Genetic Memory&quot;: 2011–2014===
In July 2010 the band announced that they were working on their fifth album &quot;Genetic Memory&quot;, The album was released in August 2011 by Escape Music. Many claiming this album a step forward for Ilium in most areas.

2012 a new song named Greenpeace Music Video dedicated to Greenpeace produced by FanVision &amp; Vida Production in cooperation with Ilium, and in acting, written and directed by Diego Vida. Composed by Ilium with Lyrics by Jason Hodges and music by Adam Smith and voice by Mike DiMeo, promoting the new Rainbow Warrior ship.

===&quot;My Misanthropia&quot;: 2015-2016 ===
The sixth full-length release from Australian-based melodic heavy metal band Ilium draws from a wide range of US, British and Euro traditional heavy and power metal styles, with dark lyrical themes from various mythologies, legends and the depths of depression. Successfully marrying many different subgenres into their own version of traditional metal.

&quot;My Misanthropia&quot; features a new man at the front in vocalist Lance King, who takes over for the departing Mike DiMeo (ex-Riot). Mike&#x27;s departure opened the doors for renowned vocalist Lance King (Balance of Power, Pyramaze, Avian) to take over. Lance&#x27;s style was very much what the band were looking for on the final product, &quot;My Misanthropia&quot; will prove to be their most accomplished works yet.

The album was released digitally on 24 March 2015. The first 1000 CD copies released were a &quot;Limited Edition Double Digipak&quot; including bonus CD &quot;Wendigo&quot; (5 Tracks) including three originals and two very special remakes; &quot;Tragedy&quot; – (The Bee Gee&#x27;s) and &quot;Love is All&quot; – (Roger Glover/Ronnie James Dio).

On 9 November 2015 Ilium released a lyric video for the song &quot;The Cryptozoologist&quot; through Nightmare&#x27;s Megaloud YouTube channel.

=== &quot;Sirens of the Styx: Re-Styxed&quot;: 2017–present ===
Released 25 October 2017. Adam Smith (guitar, bass, keyboard), Lord Tim (vocals), Tim Yatras (drums) and Jason Hodges (lyrics). It is a complete re-working of the 2003 debut, with the original also included in the physical CD package. All songs have been re-written, and re-recorded along with a brand new track – &#x27;Ode of the Trans-Dimensional Puppeteer&#x27;. Lord Tim from LORD and Dungeon, who recorded and sang backing vocals on the original, handles lead vocals.

=== Current ===
Adam Smith and Jason Hodges worked on a new EP, &quot;Quantum Evolution Event&quot;, which was released in 2022.

<text>Judy-Lynn del Rey née Benjamin (January 26, 1943 – February 20, 1986) was a science fiction editor.

She was a fan and regular attendee at science fiction conventions and worked her way up the publishing ladder, starting with work at the science fiction magazine &quot;Galaxy&quot;. She was Managing Editor of &quot;Galaxy&quot; magazine from July 1969 until July 1971, whilst also working on &quot;If&quot; magazine.

Judy-Lynn was a friend of Lester del Rey, marrying him in March 1971, after the death of his third wife. After moving to Ballantine Books, she revitalized the publisher&#x27;s once-prominent science fiction line, and soon after brought in Lester to edit Ballantine&#x27;s fantasy line. With their success, she was given her own imprint, called Del Rey Books. She also edited an original science fiction anthology series, &quot;Stellar&quot;, one of which, &quot;Stellar&quot; #2, won the Locus Award for &quot;Best Anthology&quot; in 1976. As an editor, she was known for her rapport with authors. Philip K. Dick called her a &quot;master craftsman&quot; and &quot;the best editor I&#x27;ve ever worked with&quot;, and Isaac Asimov described her as &quot;incredibly intelligent, quick-witted, hard-driving&quot; and &quot;generally recognised (especially by me) as one of the top editors in the business&quot;. She was also instrumental in obtaining the rights to publish novels based on George Lucas&#x27;s then-unreleased movie &quot;Star Wars&quot;, which would earn Ballantine/Del Rey several million dollars.

Del Rey was born with dwarfism.

She suffered a brain hemorrhage in October 1985 and died several months later. In 1986, she was posthumously awarded the Hugo Award for Best Professional Editor, but Lester del Rey declined the award in her name, saying that she would have objected to the award being given to her just because she had recently died.

On October 1, 2024, PBS premiered a documentary about her, &quot;Judy-Lynn del Rey: The Galaxy Gal&quot;.

<text>The UC Berkeley College of Chemistry is one of the fifteen schools and colleges at the University of California, Berkeley. It houses the department of chemistry and the department of chemical and biomolecular engineering. 

The College offers bachelor of science degrees in chemistry, chemical engineering, and chemical biology. Chemistry undergraduates have the option to earn a bachelor of arts degree in chemistry from the College of Letters and Science or to specialize in a materials chemistry concentration. With the College of Engineering, the College of Chemistry offers two joint majors: chemical engineering/materials science &amp; engineering and chemical engineering/nuclear engineering. Its graduate programs confer M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in chemical engineering, a Ph.D. in chemistry, and three professional master&#x27;s degrees.

==History==
Although Berkeley began offering chemistry courses in 1869, the College was not officially established until 1872, awarding its first Ph.D. in 1885 to John Maxson Stillman, who later founded the chemistry department at Stanford University. A division of chemical engineering was formed in 1946, becoming a department in 1957. The department of chemical engineering changed its name to chemical and biomolecular engineering in 2010 to reflect the widening research interests of its faculty.

Faculty and researchers at the College and affiliated with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory are responsible for the discovery of sixteen elements, including berkelium, californium, and seaborgium, named after Nobel laureate, department chair, and alumnus Glenn Seaborg.

==Students and faculty==
Today, the College comprises one of the largest chemistry programs in the nation, with a faculty of 96 professors, researchers, and lecturers and an enrollment of 963 undergraduate, 539 postgraduate, and 123 postdoctoral students. In the spring of 2021, the College conferred 187 bachelor&#x27;s degrees and 93 graduate degrees. The faculty includes a Nobel laureate, twelve members of the National Academy of Engineering; 37 members of the National Academy of Sciences; and 34 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The College has thirty endowed chairs and professorships.

==Campus==
The College occupies a complex of six buildings on the northeastern corner of the Berkeley campus. Completed in 1917, Gilman Hall, where plutonium was identified in 1941, is the oldest of the buildings. Pimentel Hall, one of the largest lecture halls on campus, features a revolving stage that can accommodate chemistry demonstrations. The buildings are linked by a network of underground hallways and laboratories. The newest building, Tan Hall, was dedicated in 1997. A new building, Healthcock Hall, is scheduled to break ground in 2023-24.

<text>The Swedish Air Force ( or just ) is the air force branch of the Swedish Armed Forces.

==History==
The Swedish Air Force was created on 1 July 1926 when the aircraft units of the Army and Navy were merged. Because of the escalating international tension during the 1930s the Air Force was reorganized and expanded from four to seven squadrons.

=== World War II ===
When World War II broke out in 1939 further expansion was initiated and this substantial expansion was not finished until the end of the war. Although Sweden never entered the war, a large air force was considered necessary to ward off the threat of invasion and to resist pressure through military threats from the great powers. By 1945 the Swedish Air Force had over 800 combat-ready aircraft, including 15 fighter divisions.

A major problem for the Swedish Air Force during World War II was the lack of fuel. Sweden was surrounded by countries at war and could not rely on imported oil. Instead domestic oil shale was heated to produce the needed petrol.

About 250 aircrew were killed in crashes 1939-1945 according to statistics that were not disclosed during the war years but published afterwards.

===Expansion during the Cold War===
The Swedish Air Force underwent a rapid modernization from 1945. It was no longer politically acceptable to equip it with second-rate aircraft types. Instead, the Air Staff purchased the best it could find from abroad, e.g. P-51D Mustangs, De Havilland Mosquito NF.19 night fighters and de Havilland Vampires, and supported the development of top performance domestic models. The Saab 29 Tunnan jet fighter was introduced around 1950.

In the late 1950s the Swedish Air Force introduced the Bas 60 air base system, which revolved around force dispersal of air squadrons across many wartime air bases in case of war in order to make it complicated for an opponent to destroy the air force on the ground. Road runways were also introduced as backup runways. Bas 60 was developed further into Bas 90 during the 1970s and 1980s.

During the Cold War large amounts of money (including funds intended for the Swedish nuclear weapons programme) were spent on the Swedish Air Force and domestic aircraft production. In 1957 Sweden had the world&#x27;s fourth most powerful air force, with about 1,000 modern planes in front-line service. During the 1950s, it introduced fighters such as the Saab J 29 Tunnan, Saab A 32 Lansen and Saab J 35 Draken.

In June 1952 the Swedish Air Force lost two aircraft on Cold War operations, in what became known as the Catalina affair. A signals intelligence Douglas DC-3 was intercepted by Soviet MiG-15s over the Baltic, and shot down with the loss of three aircrew and five civilian technicians. A PBY Catalina rescue seaplane was then also downed, the five-man crew being rescued from the sea by a freighter.

In the air defense role the Swedish Air Force also operated surface-to-air missiles. Svea Air Corps (F 8) operated de Havilland J-28B Vampire jet aircraft in 1949 being replaced in 1953 by Saab J-29 Tunnan and in 1957 by J-34 Hunter fighters. As of 1961 F 8 reroled into missile defence role becoming the air force technical training centre for using the new RB-68 Bloodhound systems in 2 squadrons until 1974.

These Swedish units also operated the RB-68 missile system (1 squadron each):
*Scania Wing, also F 10 Ängelholm
*Kalmar Wing, also F 12 Kalmar,
*Bråvalla Wing, also F 13 Norrköping
*Blekinge Wing, also F 17 Kallinge,

==== Death toll during the Cold War ====
In the Cold War era, more than 600 Swedish fighter pilots were killed in crashes during peacetime exercises and training in the 1945–1991 period. In the 1950s–60s era the flight training curriculum was deficient and the training regimes were too risky and some aircraft types had design flaws. In the 1950s, about 21 pilots were killed annually.

In the 1960s the average number of killed were 13 per year, which meant Sweden had sixfold mortality rate per 100,000 flight hours compared to the United States. In the 1960s flight safety started to become a consideration, not due to the death toll but because the aircraft were getting increasingly expensive. In October 1960, a Lansen fighter crashed into a farmhouse and killed 7 people. In the 1970s the death toll was reduced to 6–7 per year. In subsequent years, it continued to fall and from 1996 onwards, no fatal accident has been recorded.

===War service===
The Swedish Air Force has been involved in three wars, the Finno-Soviet Winter War in 1939–40, in which volunteers took part, the Congo Crisis, 1961–64, and in the 2011 Libyan civil war.

====Finland 1940====
When the Soviet Union attacked Finland in November 1939, Sweden came to its neighbour&#x27;s assistance but eventually decided not to join the war.

A Swedish volunteer infantry brigade and a volunteer air squadron fought in northern Finland from January to March 1940. The squadron was designated F 19 and consisted of 12 Gloster Gladiator fighters and four Hawker Hart dive-bombers.

====Congo 1961–1964====
The Swedish Air Force saw combat as part of the United Nations peace-keeping mission ONUC during the Congo Crisis in 1961 to 1964. It established a separate air wing, F 22, equipped with a dozen Saab 29 Tunnans, which performed well under the rough conditions in central Africa. The secessionist adversaries possessed only a small number of aircraft with poor combat capabilities, e.g. Fouga Magister trainers.

===1990s restructuring===
With the end of the Cold War the Swedish Armed Forces underwent a massive restructuring process. During this time, several air bases were deemed unnecessary and closed with fighters like the Saab 37 Viggen retired prematurely. In 1994 the Air Force had over 400 fighters, by 2005 that number had sunken to fewer than 150.

===Libya 2011===
On 29 March 2011, the Swedish prime minister announced that eight Saab JAS 39 Gripens would support the UN-mandated no-fly zone over Libya. The announcement responded to a NATO request for assistance. The Swedish fighters were limited to supporting the no-fly zone and were not authorized to engage in ground attack sorties. The deployment was approved by the Swedish Riksdag on 1 April 2011 and the first jets departed for Libya on 2 April. A C-130 Hercules accompanied the fighters for mid-air refueling.

==Equipment==
===Aircraft===

Note: Three C-17 Globemaster III&#x27;s are available through the Heavy Airlift Wing based in Hungary

===Weapons===
==Organization==
=== Fighter wings ===
There are four fighter wings:
* Skaraborg Wing (F 7), at Såtenäs Air Base, operates JAS 39C/D 
* Uppland Wing (F 16), at Ärna Air Base, reestablished in 2021 and without fighter divisions as of 2024
* Blekinge Wing (F 17), at Ronneby Air Base, operates JAS 39C/D
* Norrbotten Wing (F 21), at Luleå Air Base, operates JAS 39C/D

=== Helicopter squadrons ===
The aviation units that were formerly under the Swedish Army (&quot;) and the Swedish Navy (&quot;) have been merged with the helicopter units of the Air Force to form the single Helicopter Wing () for the entire Armed Forces. The wing has been placed under the authority of the Air Force and consists of:

* 1st Helicopter Squadron, co-located with Norrbotten Wing at Luleå Air Base, operates NH90 TTH (Hkp 14)
* 2nd Helicopter Squadron, at Malmen Air Base, operates AW109 (Hkp 15) and UH-60M Black Hawk (Hkp 16)
* 3rd Helicopter Squadron, co-located with Blekinge Wing at Ronneby Air Base, operates NH90 TTH (Hkp 14) and AW109 (Hkp 15)
* 4th Helicopter Squadron, at Malmen Air Base, operates AW109 (Hkp 15) and UH-60M Black Hawk (Hkp 16)

=== Other squadrons ===
The air transport units perform airlift operations, and are used in both national and in international missions. The unit also organizes the Swedish part of the Heavy Airlift Wing in Hungary. Signals reconnaissance units conduct electronic combat reconnaissance and intelligence gathering.

* 71st Air Transport Squadron, co-located with Skaraborg Wing at Såtenäs Air Base, operates C-130H Hercules
* 74th Special Air Squadron, at Malmen Air Base, operates Gulfstream IV-SP, Saab 340 AEW&amp;C and Saab 340
* 75th State Air Squadron, at Arlanda Air Base, operates Gulfstream IV

==Future of the Swedish Air Force==
The Swedish Air Force is being adapted to new future tasks. Today about 80 Gripen C/D fighters remain in service. Some orders have been made and 60 new Jas 39 Gripen E units will join the air force in the coming years. Saab has also joined the primarily French project for the unmanned future stealth plane Dassault nEUROn.

In 2008 and 2010, the Swedish armed forces wanted to retire even more fighters and close air bases to relocate money to other branches. However, because of negative response from the public and pressure from the Swedish government, no cuts happened as of 2011.

In 2013, the USMC introduced Swedish helicopter units to the forward air control airborne mission profile for better air-ground coordination. In the same year, 60 further modified E class Gripens were ordered with the first plane to join the Air force in 2018. 

At RIAT 2022, the commander of the Swedish Air Force stated that the air force in the future (2030) will consist of 60 Jas 39C/D and 60 Jas 39E in a total of 7 fighter squadrons.

In November 2022, the Strategic Defence Plan was published in which it was announced that all NH90 helicopters will be phased out and replaced, additional Sikorsky Black Hawks will be ordered for the tactical transport role, a new medium sized helicopter for the ASW/ASuW role will be selected.

=== Saab JAS 39 Gripen E ===
Today the Swedish Air Force main fighter is the Saab JAS 39 Gripen, in the C/D versions. By 2018 95 fighters were active with about 30 of these being updated from the A version.

The heavily modernised E version will replace the current fleet of Gripen Cs. The new aircraft includes a new Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, and is powered by the General Electric F414G. It carries more fuel and weapons. The upgrade also includes new weapon systems like the Meteor missile system. In 2013, Saab signed an agreement with the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration for 60 new Gripen in the E version. The first aircraft will join the Swedish Air Force by 2025. JAS 39C/D is expected to remain in service beyond 2030.
=== Military transport aircraft ===
The Swedish C-130 Hercules (TP 84) were bought from the United States in the 1960s and has been updated several times. The Swedish Defence Materiel Administration has been tasked to update the aircraft so they can remain in service until 2030. In November 2024 the Swedish Air Force announced that it had selected the Embraer C-390 Millennium as its future military transport aircraft. As part of the Heavy Airlift Wing cooperation, Sweden also operates three Boeing C-17 which are located at Pápa Air Base in Hungary.

=== Training aircraft ===
Sweden used the Saab 105 as the primary jet-trainer until phase out per June 2024. About 40 planes were operational. Designed in the 1960s the aircraft is starting to show its age and were gradually phased out from active service. The Swedish Air Force selected the Grob G 120TP as its new Basic Trainer Aircraft, designated SK 40. 10 aircraft have been ordered and delivered but due to work environment problems caused by high workload the implementation of the new planes have been put on hold temporarily.

=== Saab GlobalEye AEW&amp;C ===

Sweden will procure the Saab GlobalEye airborne early warning and control (AEW&amp;C) platform to replace its two S100D/ASC890. The Swedish Armed Forces submitted an official request to the government to buy the Saab GlobalEye platform on October 1, 2021. On October 24, 2021 the Swedish government approved the purchase to replace its old S100D/ASC890.

On 30 June 2022 SAAB and the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) signed a contract for the acquisition of 2 GlobalEye aircraft, to be designated S 106 in Swedish service. The deal is valued at 7,3 billion SEK (US$710 million) and deliveries was scheduled for 2027. The contract also included the option to procure up to 2 additional GlobalEye aircraft. After pledging its current Saab ASC 890 platforms to Ukraine, the GlobalEye delivery was expedited and 1 additional aircraft was ordered by the Swedish Air Force.

<doc id="367258" wikidata="Q435700" url="?curid=367258" title="Takako Doi">
<text>was a prominent Japanese politician from 1980 until her retirement in 2005. She was the first female Lower House Speaker in Japan, the highest position a female politician has ever held in the country&#x27;s modern history, as well as the country&#x27;s first female Opposition Leader.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Doi was born in Hyōgo Prefecture and graduated from Doshisha University, where she studied law. She was elected to the House of Representatives, the lower house of the Diet, as a member of the Japan Socialist Party (JSP) in 1969, representing the 2nd district of Hyōgo. She spent her first ten years in the House on the sidelines, but came to national attention in 1980 when she was highly critical of Japan&#x27;s unequal treatment of women, specifically about women-only home economics degrees and the father-dominated family registration law. She pressured the Diet to sign the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in 1985.

Doi became Vice Chair of the JSP in 1983 and the first female leader of a political party division in Japanese history in 1986, as chair of the JSP Central Policy Division. The JSP took a record high number of seats in 1990, when it won 136 seats in the House of Representatives, partly because of Doi&#x27;s popularity, but she resigned her party post in 1991, in the wake of the Gulf War.

In 1994, no party held a majority in the House and the JSP took the lead in forming a coalition government. The JSP&#x27;s president, Tomiichi Murayama, became prime minister. However, the coalition collapsed in 1996 and, following a disastrous electoral defeat for the JSP later that year, Doi returned to lead the party.

===Party leader===
Doi was a popular opposition politician, but as party leader she saw her party collapse. Her chief act as leader was to rename the JSP as the Social Democratic Party (SDP), in 1996. Moderating the characters for &quot;Socialism&quot; by adding &quot;Democratic&quot; to the party name, Doi said that she wanted to form a more moderate party and bring more women into politics. Doi was responsible for recruiting young women with grass-roots activist backgrounds, such as Kiyomi Tsujimoto, into the party.

In 1998, former members of the JSP and of other parties formed the Democratic Party of Japan, and the SDP became a third-tier opposition party, watching its numbers steadily decline. The SDP was a minor party by the time the reality of the Japanese abductees taken by North Korea came to light in 2003. Doi&#x27;s status plummeted as her earlier statements telling abductee families to &quot;get over it&quot; were shown on television, as was Doi&#x27;s comment in Pyongyang in 1987 at the birthday party of Kim Il Sung: &quot;We JSP members respect the glorious success of DPRK under the great leader Kim Il Sung.&quot; Doi apologized to the families and claimed that North Korean authorities had been deceiving her all along, but resigned the party leadership soon after. In 1989, Doi, together with Naoto Kan, Keiko Chiba, Tomiichi Murayama and other 129 Japanese politicians from Japan Socialist Party, Socialist Democratic Federation and Komeito signed a petition to the South Korean President Roh Tae-woo for the release of North Korean spies including Sin Gwang-su who had kidnapped a Japanese person in June 1980.

===Loss of seats===
Doi lost her directly elected seat in the House of Representatives in the 2003 election but remained in the House, having won a seat under the proportional representation system. She lost this seat in 2005 elections.

==Death==
She died in a hospital in Hyogo Prefecture of pneumonia on 20 September 2014, at the age of 85.

===1990s===
Rugby union has been played in Namibia since 1916 when it was introduced by soldiers from South Africa who had invaded the German-run colony.

Before Namibia gained its independence in 1990, the team, as South West Africa, played in South Africa&#x27;s domestic club competition, the Currie Cup. The team achieved their best result in the 1988 season, where they finished third.

The Namibia Rugby Union was formed in March 1990, and it joined the International Rugby Board in the same month. Independence came too late for Namibia to qualify for the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Hardened by regular, tough competition in the Currie Cup, the first few years of Namibian rugby union were relatively successful, their highest point being 2–0 home series victories over Ireland and Italy in 1991. That year the Welwitschias won all 10 of their Tests, the others being five victories against Zimbabwe and one against Portugal in Lisbon. One of Namibia&#x27;s players, Andre Stoop was signed by English champion rugby league club, Wigan.

During the international seasons Namibia played six games; the first of which was a 55–23 win over Zimbabwe. Following another victory over Zimbabwe, in 1993 Namibia played Wales in Windhoek, losing 23–38. Namibia completed big victories over the Arabian Gulf rugby team, Kenya and Zimbabwe in the initial rounds of 1995 Rugby World Cup qualifying.

Russia toured Namibia in 1994, defeating the home team 31–12 in Windhoek. Although Namibia defeated Zimbabwe that year, the team lost to Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and drew with Morocco (all in Casablanca). In 1996 Namibia played two matches; losing 13–15 to Zimbabwe, and then defeating them by one point in a subsequent meeting. They played two games in 1997 as well, losing to Tonga and Zimbabwe.

During 1998 Namibia took part in the African tournaments for 1999 Rugby World Cup qualification. They started out in Round 3, where they finished second in the pool behind Zimbabwe on points difference (defeating Zimbabwe but losing to Tunisia). Namibia defeated Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Morocco and Zimbabwe to qualify for the 1999 Rugby World Cup.

The team&#x27;s participation was put in doubt when the Namibian government&#x27;s Sports Commission barred the team from participating in a South African competition it had been using as preparation, and threatened to stop the team from taking part in the World Cup. This followed criticisms from non-white rugby clubs that the Namibian Rugby Union displayed racist attitudes. Ultimately, however, the team were allowed to take part.

The 1999 World Cup marked their debut at the tournament and since then they have been Africa&#x27;s second representative alongside South Africa. While they suffered heavy defeats by France, Fiji and Canada, they took pride in scoring an early try and being level with France after 20 minutes.

===2000–present===
With a small player base, and lacking frequent or strong competition, the team has deteriorated in the 21st century. Their record in the World Cups has been poor as they have not yet managed a win. Their record defeat, 142–0 against Australia in the 2003 tournament, led to some questioning the presence of the minor teams at the tournament.

Namibia initially struggled in the qualifiers for the 2007 tournament, suffering a shock defeat to Kenya, their first ever to the African Great Lakes nation, and another to Tunisia. Following the Kenya loss, the Namibian squad slumped to 28th in the IRB rankings. However, after defeating Tunisia at home, the team was effectively through to two deciding matches against Morocco, to determine which of the two African nations would make it to France in 2007. Namibia convincingly won both legs, qualifying for the World Cup.

As the lowest ranked team at the start of the 2007 World Cup, Namibia was given no chance in its opening game of against Ireland. However, the Namibian squad frustrated Ireland, then the 5th ranked team in the world, and scored two tries for its narrowest World Cup loss of 17–32. They were convincingly beaten in their games with Argentina (63–3) and France (87–10). And, in the game in which they were seen as having the best chance to win, they suffered a disappointing 30–0 loss to Georgia, to end the tournament winless.

The African side was able to win the IRB Nations Cup in 2010.

Namibia achieved their fourth World Cup qualification in a row after defeating Côte d&#x27;Ivoire in 2011. They were drawn into Pool D, with South Africa, Wales, Fiji and Samoa. Their first match in the Rugby World Cup held in New Zealand (at the Rotorua International Stadium) resulted in a defeat by Fiji by 45–29. Their second match in this tournament was a 49–12 loss to Samoa but the third was an 87–0 loss to South Africa. In their final pool game, Wales proved to be too strong, as Namibia conceded 12 tries in an 81–7 defeat. Theuns Kotzé provided his side&#x27;s one consolation, as his conversion of a Heinz Koll try made him Namibia&#x27;s all-time highest Rugby World Cup points scorer.

The Welwitschias played the 2015 Vodacom Cup, collecting six defeats and one win against the Limpopo Blue Bulls. Namibia qualified for their fourth Rugby World Cup in 2015. They were placed in Pool C with New Zealand, Georgia, Tonga and Argentina. They managed to lose to Georgia by a single point (17–16), their best result ever and winning their first bonus point at the competition.

They qualified for the 2019 Rugby World Cup for the sixth time by winning the Rugby Africa Gold Cup and joined pool B along with South Africa, New Zealand, Italy and Canada. The team lost to New Zealand, South Africa and Italy, while the match versus Canada was cancelled because of Typhoon Hagibis.

<doc id="367266" wikidata="Q1414900" url="?curid=367266" title="El Mozote massacre">
<text>The El Mozote massacre took place both in and around the village of El Mozote, in the Morazán Department, El Salvador, on December 11 and 12, 1981, when the Salvadoran Army killed more than 811 civilians during the Salvadoran Civil War. The army had arrived in the village on the 10th, following clashes with guerrillas in the area. The Salvadoran Army&#x27;s Atlácatl Battalion, under the orders of Domingo Monterrosa was responsible for the massacre. 

In December 2011, the government of El Salvador apologized for the massacre, the largest in the Americas in modern times.

== Background ==
In 1981, various left-wing guerrilla groups coalesced into the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front to do battle against El Salvador&#x27;s military dictatorship, the Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador.

Prior to the massacre, unlike many villages in the area, El Mozote had a reputation for neutrality. While many of its neighbors were largely Catholic, and were therefore often influenced by liberation theology and sympathetic to the guerrillas, El Mozote was largely Evangelical Protestant. The village had sold some supplies to the guerrillas but it was also &quot;a place where the guerrillas had learned not to look for recruits&quot;. The people residing in the village maintained a low commercial relationship with guerrillas for their own safety, but did not ideologically associate with them due to the people&#x27;s identity of being evangelical Christians.

Prior to the massacre, the town&#x27;s wealthiest man, Marcos Díaz, had gathered the citizens in order to warn them that the army would soon pass through the area in a counterinsurgency operation, but he had been assured that the town&#x27;s residents would not be harmed if they remained in place. Concerned that fleeing the town would cause them to be mistaken for guerrillas, the townspeople chose to stay and they also extended an offer of protection to peasants from the surrounding area, who soon flooded the town.

==Massacre==
In his 1994 book, &quot;The Massacre at El Mozote&quot;, American journalist Mark Danner compiled various reports in order to reconstruct an account of the massacre:

===December 10===
On the afternoon of December 10, 1981, units of the Salvadoran Army&#x27;s Atlácatl Battalion, which was created in 1981 with US government funding and military training, arrived at the remote village of El Mozote after a clash with guerrillas in the vicinity. The Atlácatl was a &quot;rapid deployment infantry battalion&quot; specially trained for counter-insurgency warfare, and led by Domingo Monterrosa. It was the first unit of its kind in the Salvadoran armed forces, and was trained by United States military advisors. Its mission, &quot;Operación Rescate&quot; (&quot;Operation Rescue&quot;), was to eliminate the rebel presence in a small region of northern Morazán where the FMLN had two camps and a training centre.

El Mozote consisted of about 20 houses on open ground around a square. Facing onto the square was a church and, behind it, was a small building which was known as &quot;the convent&quot;. The priest used it to change into his vestments when he came to the village to celebrate Mass. Near the village was a small schoolhouse.

Upon their arrival in the village, the soldiers discovered that, in addition to being filled with its residents, the village was also filled with &quot;campesinos&quot; who had fled from the surrounding area and sought refuge in it. The soldiers ordered everyone to leave their houses and go into the square. They made people lie face down and searched them and questioned them about the guerrillas. They then ordered the villagers to lock themselves in their houses until the next day and warned them that anyone who came out would be shot. The soldiers remained in the village during the night.

===December 11 and 12===
Early the next morning, the soldiers reassembled the entire village in the square. They separated the men from the women and children, divided them into separate groups and locked them in the church, the convent, and various houses.

During the morning, they proceeded to interrogate, torture, and execute the men in several locations. Around noon, they began taking the women and older girls in groups, separating them from their children and murdering them with machine guns after raping them. Girls as young as 10 were raped, and soldiers were reportedly heard bragging about how they especially liked the 12-year-old girls. Finally, they killed the children, at first by slitting their throats, and later by hanging them from trees; one child killed in this manner was reportedly two years old. After killing the entire population, the soldiers set fire to the buildings.

The soldiers remained in El Mozote that night but, the next day, went to the village of Los Toriles and carried out a further massacre. Men, women, and children were taken from their homes, lined up, robbed, and shot, and their homes then set ablaze.

== Initial reports and controversy==
News of the massacre first appeared in the world media on January 27, 1982, in reports published by &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Raymond Bonner wrote in &quot;The New York&quot; &quot;Times&quot; of seeing &quot;the charred skulls and bones of dozens of bodies buried under burned-out roofs, beams, and shattered tiles&quot;. The villagers gave Bonner a list of 733 names, mostly children, women, and elderly, all of whom, they claimed, had been murdered by government soldiers. In response to the reporting, the Reagan White House went into overdrive behind the scenes, trying to convince as many influential reporters as possible that the stories were bogus, or that the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) rebels had staged the massacre. The &quot;N.Y. Times&quot; ultimately yanked Bonner out of El Salvador and reassigned him to a business beat—although the newspaper never acknowledged a single error in Bonner’s reporting.

Alma Guillermoprieto of &quot;The Washington&quot; &quot;Post&quot;, who visited the village separately a few days later, wrote of &quot;dozens of decomposing bodies still seen beneath the rubble and lying in nearby fields, despite the month that has passed since the incident... countless bits of bones—skulls, rib cages, femurs, a spinal column—poked out of the rubble&quot;.

Both reporters cited Rufina Amaya, a witness who had escaped into a tree during the attack. She told the reporters that the army had killed her husband and her four children (the youngest of whom was eight months old) and had then lit the bodies on fire.
Salvadoran Army and government leaders denied the reports and officials of the Reagan administration called them &quot;gross exaggerations&quot;. The Associated Press reported that &quot;the U.S. Embassy disputed the reports, saying its own investigation had found... that no more than 300 people had lived in El Mozote.&quot; Edward S. Herman has argued that the coverage of the massacre has been biased.

The conservative organization Accuracy in Media accused the &quot;Times&quot; and &quot;Post&quot; of timing their stories to release them just before the congressional debate. Five months later, Accuracy in Media devoted an entire edition of its &quot;AIM Report&quot; to Bonner in which its editor Reed Irvine declared, &quot;Mr. Bonner had been worth a division to the communists in Central America.&quot; Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Thomas O. Enders attacked Bonner and Guillermoprieto before a Senate committee, stating that there had been a battle between guerrillas and the army, but &quot;no evidence could be found to confirm that government forces systematically massacred civilians.&quot; Enders also repeated the claim that only 300 people had lived in El Mozote, and it was impossible for the death toll to have reached that reported in the &quot;Times&quot; and &quot;Post&quot; stories.

On February 8, Elliott Abrams, assistant secretary of state for human rights and humanitarian affairs, told the committee that &quot;it appears to be an incident that is at least being significantly misused, at the very best, by the guerrillas.&quot;

In February, in an editorial, &quot;The Media&#x27;s War&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; criticized Bonner&#x27;s reporting as &quot;overly credulous&quot; and &quot;out on a limb&quot;. In &quot;Time&quot; magazine, William A. Henry III wrote a month later, &quot;An even more crucial if common oversight is the fact that women and children, generally presumed to be civilians, can be active participants in guerrilla war. &quot;New York Times&quot; correspondent Raymond Bonner underplayed that possibility, for example, in a much-protested January 27 report of a massacre by the army in and around the village of [El] Mozote.&quot; The first U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidency, Deane R. Hinton, called Bonner an &quot;advocate journalist&quot;. Bonner was recalled to New York in August and later left the paper.

Although attacked less vigorously than Bonner, Guillermoprieto was also a target of criticism. A Reagan official wrote a letter to the &quot;Post&quot; stating that she had once worked for a communist newspaper in Mexico, which Guillermoprieto denied.

==Rufina Amaya&#x27;s Account==
Rufina Amaya was a Salvadoran woman who tragically became a symbol of the brutalities of the Salvadoran Civil War. Rufina Amaya was one of the few survivors of the El Mozote massacre. Her husband and four children were among those killed.

Her account details how on the day leading up to December 10th, 1981, &quot;Everything was closer every day, louder every day, and finally, by that day, the people were hiding in their houses.&quot; She explains how when the Atlácatl men arrived they were armed with M16s and shouted, &quot;Salgan!&quot; (&quot;Get out here!&quot;) They walked out in the twilight hesitantly and did not know what was happening. 

The soldiers cursed the citizens of El Mozote out and herded them into the center of the town with the butts of their rifles. Rufina Amaya, Domingo Carlos (her husband), Marta Lilián (3 years old), Cristino (9 years old), Maria Dolores (5 years old), and Maria Isabel (8 months old) emerged outside and were told like everyone else to lie face down and consequently were pushed down into the dirt. The sound of children crying and soldiers giving orders was all you could hear in the darkness. People would be kicked on the ground and subsequently asked questions about the &quot;guerrillas.&quot; The soldiers thought the people of El Mozote were hiding these guerrillas in their town and were against the government of El Salvador.

Rufina said, &quot;They were very abusive. We couldn&#x27;t do anything. They all had guns. We had to obey.&quot; She thought they, &quot;were sentenced to death right there,&quot; in that moment. Finally, they were ordered to stand up and return to their houses. The soldiers said they didn&#x27;t want to see, &quot;even so much as their noses&quot; poke outside of the house. Amaya explains how the houses were packed full of people and the wailing children made the conditions even worse. The soldiers in the center of the town were singing and laughing as they shot their guns into the sky. The children in the house were hungry and afraid and &quot;we could do nothing for them.&quot;

The soldiers again ordered the citizens outside and told them to &quot;Form lines! Men and older boys over here! Women and children over there!&quot; The soldiers looked them up and down as a helicopter arrived. Men were ordered into the church and the women and children were crowded into the house of Alfredo Marquez. The helicopter then took off and left. 

Rufina could hear shouting from the church. They could hear the men yelling, &quot;No! No! Don&#x27;t do this to us! Don&#x27;t kill us!&quot; She and her eldest son looked out the window to see what was going on and the soldiers were leading groups of men out of the church. She saw her husband try to escape as he was led out, but there was nowhere to go. Rufina&#x27;s husband was shot with burst rounds of M-16s. Where they lay the soldiers brought out machetes and beheaded them with strong blows to the backs of their necks. Rufina hugged her children as she cried and her son was shouting, &quot;They killed my father!&quot; Many men from the church were interrogated throughout the night and at 8 o&#x27;clock many men were decapitated after being interrogated.

The next morning, groups of 10 men were continually led to a hill known as El Pinalito. In the distance, Rufina could hear gunshots from the hill and only the soldiers would return. &quot;All morning you could hear the shots, the crying, and the screaming.&quot; 

Later that day, soldiers came back and said, &quot;Now it&#x27;s your turn, women.&quot; Younger women and girls were led out first and led to the hills of El Chingo and La Cruz. From the house, Rufina could hear the screams of the women who were led to the hills where they were raped.

The soldiers came back from the hills and began to separate women and children. They would take groups of women, one after another. Rufina was found in the last group of women. She fought against the soldiers who were taking her away from her 4 children. The women were marched down the main streets and could see houses burning and blood on the ground. They were led to the house of Israel Marquez and the women at the front of the line screamed because they saw pools of blood on the floor and piles of bloody corpses. Women were heard screaming, &quot;There are dead people! They&#x27;re killing people!&quot; The women struggled and the soldiers said, &quot;Don&#x27;t cry, women. Here comes the devil to take you.&quot;

At this moment, as Rufina felt death upon her, fell to her knees asking, &quot;god to forgive my sins.&quot; She explained how she was at the feet of the soldiers &quot;between a crab-apple and a pine tree.&quot; She thinks this is how she was saved. With all the commotion going on around her, the soldiers lost track of her and she crawled between the trees and hid. She says, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t move, couldn&#x27;t even cry. I had to remain absolutely still and silent. She witnessed the women grabbing each other and led into the house where she then heard shots and screams. Rufina continued to hear the cries of terror, the screaming, the begging, and the shooting.

Rufina hid in the trees as the houses were burned to the ground. The soldiers at this moment she heard contemplating what to do with the children. Some of the soldiers were against killing the kids, but the others said, &quot;We have orders to finish everyone and we have to complete our orders. That&#x27;s it.&quot; The soldiers felt that the guerrilla notion would grow up in the children eventually to the point where the children would become the guerrillas. 

Later that night, Rufina began to hear cries from the house where the children were. She could hear her son Cristino crying, &quot;Mama Rufina, help me! They&#x27;re killing me! They killed my sister! They&#x27;re killing me! Help me!&quot; Rufina didn&#x27;t want to hear the cries so she crawled away into a bush. She dug a little hole for her face so she could cry and not be heard. As the night went on, the soldiers were ordered to burn the houses and the church to the ground. She witnessed the buildings go up in flames and screams from inside the building of the people who were still alive in some capacity. Where she first escaped and lay, soldiers thought they saw a woman and fired rounds into the area she used to be. She lay still all night making sure the soldiers would not hear or see her. She witnessed everything that went down and finally, the soldiers left after massacring El Mozote.
== Later investigation ==
On October 26, 1990, a criminal complaint was filed against the Atlácatl Battalion for the massacre by Pedro Chicas Romero of La Joya. Romero had survived the massacre himself by hiding in a cave above the town. When Romero filed the complaint with the Court of the First Instance in the San Francisco Gotera, he used Rufina Amaya, sole survivor of the El Mozote Massacre, as his witness.

In 1992, as part of the peace settlement established by the Chapultepec Peace Accords signed in Mexico City on January 16 of that year, the United Nations-sanctioned Truth Commission for El Salvador investigating human rights abuses committed during the war, supervised the exhumations of the El Mozote&#x27;s remains by the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team (EAAF), beginning November 17. The excavation confirmed the previous reports of Bonner and Guillermoprieto that hundreds of civilians had been killed on the site.

The Salvadoran minister of defense and the chief of the armed forces joint staff informed the truth commission that they had no information that would make it possible to identify the units and officers who participated in &quot;Operación Rescate&quot;. They claimed that there were no records for the period. The truth commission stated in its final report:


In 1993, El Salvador passed an amnesty law for all individuals implicated by UN investigations, which effectively exempted the army from prosecution. That year, Danner published an article in the December 6 issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. His article, &quot;The Truth of El Mozote&quot;, caused widespread consternation, as it rekindled the debate regarding the United States&#x27; role in Central America during the violence-torn 1970s and 1980s. He subsequently expanded the article into a book, &quot;The Massacre at El Mozote&quot; (1994). In a prefatory remark, Danner wrote:

In 1993, a special state department panel that examined the actions of U.S. diplomats vis-à-vis human rights in El Salvador concluded that &quot;mistakes were certainly made... particularly in the failure to get the truth about the December 1981 massacre at El Mozote.&quot; In his study of the media and the Reagan administration, &quot;On Bended Knee&quot;, U.S. author Mark Hertsgaard wrote of the significance of the first reports of the massacre:

What made the Morazan massacre stories so threatening was that they repudiated the fundamental moral claim that undergirded US policy. They suggested that what the United States was supporting in Central America was not democracy but repression. They therefore threatened to shift the political debate from means to ends, from how best to combat the supposed Communist threat—send US troops or merely US aid?—to why the United States was backing state terrorism in the first place.

A later court decision overturned the amnesty for defendants suspected of &quot;egregious human rights violations&quot; but attempts by Salvadoran lawyers to reopen the case repeatedly failed.

==Legacy==
On March 7, 2005, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States reopened an investigation into the El Mozote massacre based on the evidence found by the Argentine forensic anthropologists. As of December 2011, activists continued to lobby the Inter-American Court of Human Rights to hear the case.

In a January 2007 report in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, a former Salvadoran soldier, José Wilfredo Salgado, told of returning to El Mozote several months after the massacre and collecting the skulls of the youngest victims, whose remains were exposed by recent rains, for &quot;candleholders and good-luck charms&quot;.

In December 2011, the Salvadoran government formally apologized for the massacre, in a ceremony in the town. Foreign Minister Hugo Martinez, speaking on the government&#x27;s behalf, called the massacre the &quot;blindness of state violence&quot; and asked for forgiveness.

In October 2012, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ordered El Salvador to investigate the El Mozote massacre and bring those responsible to justice. The court ruled that an amnesty law did not cover the killings.

On June 2, 2019, newly sworn in President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, ordered the removal of Colonel Domingo Monterrosa&#x27;s name from the Third Infantry Brigade barracks in San Miguel. The United Nations blamed Colonel Monterrosa for ordering the El Mozote massacre.

In November 2021, the Bukele administration proposed a Foreign Agents Law that would require individuals and organizations that receive funding from sources outside of El Salvador to register as foreign agents. Human rights organizations such as Cristosal, an advocate for justice in the El Mozote case, warned that the adoption of such a bill would threaten the operation of human rights groups, labeling them as “foreign agents” and slowing their ability to investigate the happenings of the El Mozote massacre.

=== 2016 reopening of inquiry ===
In 2016, Judge Jorge Guzmán reopened the judicial inquiry into the massacre, following the overturning of the amnesty law by the Salvadoran Supreme Court. However, the inquiry faced obstruction from the Bukele administration. President Bukele ordered the army to block Guzmán from executing a search warrant at the military archives and barracks and further accused Guzmán and the families of the victims of being part of a plot against his government. 

In April 2021, Stanford professor Terry Karl testified before the inquiry that United States military advisor Allen Bruce Hazelwood was likely present during the massacre, based on documents and interviews. According to Karl, Hazelwood was with Colonel Monterrosa at the Atlácatl barracks at the start of the massacre, and accompanied Monterrosa by helicopter to the ongoing massacre. Karl alleged that the United States government engaged in a &quot;sophisticated cover-up operation&quot; to conceal the massacre and American presence. Karl also revealed that in 1982, Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights Elliot Abrams told the director of Human Rights Watch about the presence of an American advisor at El Mozote in private conversation. Hazelwood denied the allegations of being present during the massacre, stating that he was actually 100 miles away training soldiers of the Atlácatl Battalion at the time.

In September 2021, the inquiry was effectively ended as Guzmán was removed as judge and forced to retire by Bukele following judicial reforms many saw as being targeted against the inquiry. Guzmán and other judges who opposed his firing have since faced harassment and retaliation by unknown perpetrators, the police, and government officials

<doc id="367267" wikidata="Q1640495" url="?curid=367267" title="Sampo Group">
<text>Sampo is a northern European P&amp;C insurance group with operations in the Nordics, Baltics, and the UK.

Sampo is made up of the parent company Sampo plc, If P&amp;C Insurance, Danish insurer Topdanmark and British P&amp;C insurer Hastings Insurance. The parent company is responsible for the group&#x27;s strategy, capital allocation, risk management, group accounts, investor relations, sustainability, and legal and tax matters.

Sampo Group employs over 13,000 employees. Torbjörn Magnusson is the CEO.

== History ==
The story of Sampo began in 1909, when the Mutual Insurance Company Sampo was established in Turku, Finland.

The 1980s were a turning point in Sampo&#x27;s history. In 1987, Sampo changed its company type from a mutual insurance company to a limited company. The company&#x27;s insurance customers became shareholders, and Sampo was listed on the Helsinki Stock Exchange in January 1988.

The merger of Sampo and state-owned Leonia Bank was the number one business news story at the turn of the millennium. Sampo&#x27;s Annual General Meeting approved the merger in April 2000. The Finnish state became the largest owner of Sampo-Leonia.

Leonia Bank became Sampo Bank in February 2001, and Investment Bank Mandatum joined Sampo Group later that spring. Björn Wahlroos became Group CEO and President and brought with him a new type of thinking derived from his banking expertise. The focus of operations shifted towards bank services and long-term savings.

In 2002, Sampo became a shareholder of the Nordic property and casualty insurance company If. Two years later, Sampo bought out the Norwegian company Storebrand, the Swedish-owned Skandia, and the Finnish insurance company Varma, making itself the sole owner of If.

In 2006, Sampo Group announced a historic divestment, selling its banking operations, known as Sampo Bank, to the Danish Danske Bank for over €4 billion (US$4.5 billion). This sale allowed Sampo to focus on its insurance business, with the proceeds invested in shares of Nordea, the largest bank in the Nordic region, until Sampo sold its entire holding in Nordea in April 2022.

On 29 March 2023 the Board proposed a demerger of Sampo plc by separating Mandatum from Sampo. The Annual General Meeting approved the demerger plan on 17 May 2023. The partial demerger of Sampo plc became effective on 1 October 2023.

In June 2024 Sampo announced its decision to make a recommended, best and final public exchange offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares in Topdanmark not already owned by Sampo. The offer period expired on 9 September 2024. Based on the final result of the offer announced on 16 September 2024, the exchange offer to the shareholders of Topdanmark will be completed.

== Structure ==
Nowadays, Sampo Group consists of the parent company Sampo plc and the subsidiaries:

* If, which is the largest P&amp;C insurer in the Nordic Countries;
* the Danish P&amp;C insurance company Topdanmark and
* P&amp;C insurer Hastings in the UK.

Through its subsidiaries, Sampo operates in Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Baltic countries, and the UK.

== Board of directors ==
Selected board members at the Annual General Meeting held on April 25, 2024:

* Antti Mäkinen, Chair of the Board since 17.5.2023, Board member 2018-2021
* Jannica Fagerholm, Vice Chair of the Board since 9.4.2019, Board member since 18.4.2013
* Christian Clausen, Board member since 21.4.2016
* Georg Ehrnrooth, Board member since 2.6.2020
* Steve Langan, Board member since 18.5.2022

* Markus Rauramo, Board member since 19.5.2021
* Astrid Stange, Board member since 25.4.2024
* Annica Witschard, Board member since 17.5.2023

==Shareholders==
Sampo has A shares and B shares. Sampo plc&#x27;s A share has been listed on NASDAQ OMX Helsinki (former Helsinki Stock Exchange) since January 1988 and is nowadays one of the most valuable companies on Nasdaq Helsinki. Sampo is also listed on Nasdaq Stockholm through Swedish Depositary Receipts (SDRs) and on Nasdaq Copenhagen.

The largest registered shareholders by number of shares (31 January, 2024). The list does not include owners of nominee-registered shares.

At the end of 2023, Sampo had over 206,000 shareholders. Approximately 60 per cent of shares were held by foreign and nominee registered shareholders. 

== Sustainability ==
In 2017, Sampo plc published the first group-level sustainability report. In 2019, the Group joined the UN Global Compact initiative and signed the UN PRI. In addition to the group-level sustainability reporting, each individual Sampo Group company publishes their own sustainability reports annually.
==Name==

In Finnish mythology, the name &quot;Sampo&quot; refers to a mythical machine that creates salt, food, flour and gold out of nothing.

<text>The International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE), also known as the Tokyo Trial and the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal, was a military trial convened on 29 April 1946 to try leaders of the Empire of Japan for their crimes against peace, conventional war crimes, and crimes against humanity, leading up to and during the Second World War. The IMTFE was modeled after the International Military Tribunal (IMT) at Nuremberg, Germany, which prosecuted the leaders of Nazi Germany for their war crimes, crimes against peace, and crimes against humanity.

Following Japan&#x27;s defeat and occupation by the Allies, the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, United States General Douglas MacArthur, issued a special proclamation establishing the IMTFE. A charter was drafted to establish the court&#x27;s composition, jurisdiction, and procedures; the crimes were defined based on the Nuremberg Charter. The Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal was composed of judges, prosecutors, and staff from eleven countries that had fought against Japan: Australia, Canada, China, France, India, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Philippines, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States; the defense consisted of Japanese and American lawyers. The Tokyo Trial exercised broader temporal jurisdiction than its counterpart in Nuremberg, beginning from the 1931 Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Twenty-eight high-ranking Japanese military and political leaders were tried by the court, including current and former prime ministers, cabinet members, and military commanders. They were charged with fifty-five separate counts, including the waging wars of aggression, murder, and various war crimes and crimes against humanity (such as torture and forced labor) against prisoners-of-war, civilian internees, and the inhabitants of occupied territories; ultimately, 45 of the counts, including all the murder charges, were ruled either redundant or not authorized under the IMTFE Charter. The Tokyo Trial lasted more than twice as long as the better-known Nuremberg trials, and its impact was similarly influential in the development of international law; similar international war crimes tribunals would not be established until the 1990s.

By the time it adjourned on November 12, 1948, two defendants had died of natural causes and one, Shūmei Ōkawa, was ruled unfit to stand trial. All remaining defendants were found guilty of at least one count, of whom seven were sentenced to death and sixteen to life imprisonment.

Thousands of other &quot;lesser&quot; war criminals were tried by domestic tribunals convened across Asia and the Pacific by Allied nations, with most concluding by 1949. Due to U.S. government intervention, the trials did not charge imperial Japanese leaders who may have been responsible for Unit 731.

==Background==

The Tribunal was established to implement the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Declaration, the Instrument of Surrender, and the Moscow Conference. The Potsdam Declaration (July 1945) had stated, &quot;stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon our prisoners,&quot; though it did not specifically foreshadow trials. The terms of reference for the Tribunal were set out in the IMTFE Charter, issued on January 19, 1946. There was major disagreement, both among the Allies and within their administrations, about whom to try and how to try them. Despite the lack of consensus, General Douglas MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers, decided to initiate arrests. On September 11, a week after the surrender, he ordered the arrest of 39 suspects—most of them members of General Hideki Tojo&#x27;s war cabinet. Tojo tried to commit suicide but was resuscitated with the help of U.S. physicians.

==Creation of the court==

On January 19, 1946, MacArthur issued a special proclamation ordering the establishment of an International Military Tribunal for the Far East (IMTFE). On the same day, he also approved the Charter of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (CIMTFE), which prescribed how it was to be formed, the crimes that it was to consider, and how the tribunal was to function. The charter generally followed the model set by the Nuremberg trials. On April 25, in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of the CIMTFE, the original Rules of Procedure of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East with amendments were promulgated.

==Tokyo War Crimes Trial==
Following months of preparation, the IMTFE convened on April 29, 1946. The trials were held in the War Ministry office in Tokyo.

On May 3 the prosecution opened its case, charging the defendants with crimes against peace, conventional war crimes, and crimes against humanity. The trial continued for more than two and a half years, hearing testimony from 419 witnesses and admitting 4,336 exhibits of evidence, including depositions and affidavits from 779 other individuals.

===Charges===
Following the model used at the Nuremberg trials in Germany, the Allies established three broad categories:

* &quot;Class A&quot; charges covered crimes against peace, that is, waging a war of aggression against other nations, and only applied to Japan&#x27;s top leaders who had planned and directed the war. Unlike the Nuremberg trials, the charge of crimes against peace was a prerequisite to prosecution—only those individuals whose crimes included crimes against peace could be prosecuted by the Tribunal. 
* &quot;Class B&quot; charges covered conventional war crimes, that is, violations of the laws of war in which only enemy and neutral nationals can be the principal victims, such as the Rape of Nanking, the attack on the neutral U.S. at Pearl Harbor without warning, or the Bataan Death March.
* &quot;Class C&quot; charges covered crimes against humanity, that is, systematic violence, deportation, or enslavement of any civilian population in time of peace or war, or persecutions on political or racial grounds in the execution of or in connection with any foregoing crimes. This category was created mainly to address atrocities committed by a state against its own nationals or allied citizens, such as Japan&#x27;s use of Korean and Taiwanese subjects as forced laborers and comfort women.

The indictment accused the defendants of promoting a scheme of conquest that:[C]ontemplated and carried out ... murdering, maiming and ill-treating prisoners of war (and) civilian internees ... forcing them to labor under inhumane conditions ... plundering public and private property, wantonly destroying cities, towns and villages beyond any justification of military necessity; (perpetrating) mass murder, rape, pillage, brigandage, torture and other barbaric cruelties upon the helpless civilian population of the over-run countries.The chief prosecutor, Joseph B. Keenan, issued a press statement along with the indictment: &quot;War and treaty-breakers should be stripped of the glamour of national heroes and exposed as what they really are—plain, ordinary murderers.&quot;

===Evidence and testimony===
Any possible evidence that would incriminate Emperor Hirohito and his family was excluded from the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, as the United States believed it needed him to maintain order in Japan and achieve their postwar objectives.

The prosecution began opening statements on May 3, 1946, and took 192 days to present its case, finishing on January 24, 1947. It submitted its evidence in fifteen phases.

The Tribunal embraced the best evidence rule once the Prosecution had rested. The best evidence rule dictates that the &quot;best&quot; or most authentic evidence must be produced (for example, a map instead of a description of the map; an original instead of a copy; and a witness instead of a description of what the witness may have said). Justice Pal, one of two justices to vote for acquittal on all counts, observed, &quot;in a proceeding where we had to allow the prosecution to bring in any amount of hearsay evidence, it was somewhat misplaced caution to introduce this best evidence rule particularly when it operated practically against the defense only&quot;.

The prosecution team relied on the doctrine of command responsibility, which obviated the need to prove the various alleged atrocities were the result of the defendants&#x27; illegal orders. The prosecution instead had to prove three things: that war crimes were systematic or widespread; the accused knew that troops were committing atrocities; and the accused had power or authority to stop the crimes.

Part of Article 13 of the Charter provided that evidence against the accused could include any document &quot;without proof of its issuance or signature&quot; as well as diaries, letters, press reports, and sworn or unsworn out-of-court statements relating to the charges. Article 13 of the Charter read, in part: &quot;The tribunal shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence ... and shall admit any evidence which it deems to have probative value.

The prosecution argued that a 1927 document known as the Tanaka Memorial showed that a &quot;common plan or conspiracy&quot; to commit &quot;crimes against peace&quot; bound the accused together. Thus, the prosecution argued that the conspiracy had begun in 1927 and continued through to the end of the war in 1945. The Tanaka Memorial is now considered by most historians to have been an anti-Japanese forgery; however, it was not regarded as such at the time.

Wartime press releases of the Allies offered as evidence by the prosecution were admitted, while those sought to be entered by the defense were excluded. The recollection of a conversation with a long-dead man was admitted. Letters allegedly written by Japanese citizens were admitted with no proof of authenticity and no opportunity for cross examination by the defense.

===Defense===
The defendants were represented by over a hundred attorneys, three-quarters of them Japanese and one-quarter American, plus a support staff. The defense opened its case on January 27, 1947, and finished its presentation 225 days later on September 9, 1947.

The defense argued that the trial could never be free from substantial doubt as to its &quot;legality, fairness and impartiality&quot;.

The defense challenged the indictment, arguing that crimes against peace, and more specifically, the undefined concepts of conspiracy and aggressive war, had yet to be established as crimes in international law; in effect, the IMTFE was contradicting accepted legal procedure by trying the defendants retroactively for violating laws which had not existed when the alleged crimes had been committed. The defense insisted that there was no basis in international law for holding individuals responsible for acts of state, as the Tokyo Trial proposed to do. The defense attacked the notion of negative criminality, by which the defendants were to be tried for failing to prevent breaches of law and war crimes by others, as likewise having no basis in international law.

The defense argued that Allied Powers&#x27; violations of international law should be examined.

Former Foreign Minister Shigenori Tōgō maintained that Japan had had no choice but to enter the war for self-defense purposes. He asserted that &quot;[because of the Hull note] we felt at the time that Japan was being driven either to war or suicide&quot;.

===Judgment===
After the defense had finished its presentation on September 9, 1947, the IMT spent fifteen months reaching judgement and drafting its 1,781-page opinion. The reading of the judgement and the sentences lasted from December 4 to 12, 1948. Five of the eleven justices released separate opinions outside the court.

In his concurring opinion Justice William Webb of Australia took issue with Emperor Hirohito&#x27;s legal status, writing, &quot;The suggestion that the Emperor was bound to act on advice is contrary to the evidence.&quot; While refraining from personal indictment of Hirohito, Webb indicated that Hirohito bore responsibility as a constitutional monarch who accepted &quot;ministerial and other advice for war&quot; and that &quot;no ruler can commit the crime of launching aggressive war and then validly claim to be excused for doing so because his life would otherwise have been in danger ... It will remain that the men who advised the commission of a crime, if it be one, are in no worse position than the man who directs the crime be committed.&quot;

Justice Delfín Jaranilla of the Philippines disagreed with the penalties imposed by the tribunal as being &quot;too lenient, not exemplary and deterrent, and not commensurate with the gravity of the offence or offences committed.&quot;

Justice Henri Bernard of France argued that the tribunal&#x27;s course of action was flawed due to Hirohito&#x27;s absence and the lack of sufficient deliberation by the judges. He concluded that Japan&#x27;s declaration of war &quot;had a principal author who escaped all prosecution and of whom in any case the present Defendants could only be considered as accomplices&quot; and that a &quot;verdict reached by a Tribunal after a defective procedure cannot be a valid one.&quot;

&quot;It is well-nigh impossible to define the concept of initiating or waging a war of aggression both accurately and comprehensively,&quot; wrote Justice Bert Röling of the Netherlands in his dissent. He stated, &quot;I think that not only should there have been neutrals in the court, but there should have been Japanese also.&quot; He argued that they would always have been a minority and therefore would not have been able to sway the balance of the trial. However, &quot;they could have convincingly argued issues of government policy which were unfamiliar to the Allied justices.&quot; Pointing out the difficulties and limitations in holding individuals responsible for an act of state and making omission of responsibility a crime, Röling called for the acquittal of several defendants, including Hirota.

Justice Radhabinod Pal of India produced a judgment in which he dismissed the legitimacy of the IMTFE as victor&#x27;s justice: &quot;I would hold that each and every one of the accused must be found not guilty of each and every one of the charges in the indictment and should be acquitted on all those charges.&quot; While taking into account the influence of wartime propaganda, exaggerations, and distortions of facts in the evidence, and &quot;over-zealous&quot; and &quot;hostile&quot; witnesses, Pal concluded, &quot;The evidence is still overwhelming that atrocities were perpetrated by the members of the Japanese armed forces against the civilian population of some of the territories occupied by them as also against the prisoners of war.&quot;

===Sentencing===

One defendant, Shūmei Ōkawa, was found mentally unfit for trial and the charges were dropped.

Two defendants, Yōsuke Matsuoka and Osami Nagano, died of natural causes during the trial.

Six defendants were sentenced to death by hanging for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and crimes against peace (Class A, Class B and Class C):
* General Kenji Doihara, chief of the intelligence services in Manchukuo
* Kōki Hirota, prime minister (later foreign minister)
* General Seishirō Itagaki, war minister
* General Heitarō Kimura, commander, Burma Area Army
* Lieutenant General Akira Mutō, chief of staff, 14th Area Army
* General Hideki Tōjō, commander, Kwantung Army (later prime minister)
One defendant was sentenced to death by hanging for war crimes and crimes against humanity (Class B and Class C):
* General Iwane Matsui, commander, Shanghai Expeditionary Force and Central China Area Army

The seven defendants who were sentenced to death were executed at Sugamo Prison in Ikebukuro on December 23, 1948. MacArthur, afraid of embarrassing and antagonizing the Japanese people, defied the wishes of President Truman and barred photography of any kind, instead bringing in four members of the Allied Council to act as official witnesses.

Sixteen defendants were sentenced to life imprisonment. Three (Koiso, Shiratori, and Umezu) died in prison, while the other thirteen were paroled between 1952 and 1958:
* General Sadao Araki, war minister
* Colonel Kingorō Hashimoto, major instigator of the second Sino-Japanese War
* Field Marshal Shunroku Hata, war minister
* Baron Kiichirō Hiranuma, prime minister
* Naoki Hoshino, Chief Cabinet Secretary
* Okinori Kaya, Minister of Finance
* Marquis Kōichi Kido, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal
* General Kuniaki Koiso, governor-general of Korea, later prime minister
* General Jirō Minami, commander, Kwantung Army, former governor-general of Korea
* Vice Admiral Takazumi Oka, chief of the Naval Affairs Bureau
* Lieutenant General Hiroshi Ōshima, Ambassador to Germany
* Lieutenant General Kenryō Satō, chief of the Military Affairs Bureau
* Admiral Shigetarō Shimada, naval minister and Chief of the Navy General Staff
* Toshio Shiratori, Ambassador to Italy
* Lieutenant General Teiichi Suzuki, president of the Cabinet Planning Board
* General Yoshijirō Umezu, war minister and Chief of the Army General Staff
* Foreign minister Shigenori Tōgō was sentenced to 20 years&#x27; imprisonment. Togo died in prison in 1950.
* Foreign minister Mamoru Shigemitsu was sentenced to 7 years and paroled in 1950. He later served as Foreign Minister and as Deputy Prime Minister of post-war Japan under Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama.

The verdict and sentences of the tribunal were confirmed by MacArthur on November 24, 1948, two days after a perfunctory meeting with members of the Allied Control Commission for Japan, who acted as the local representatives of the nations of the Far Eastern Commission. Six of those representatives made no recommendations for clemency. Australia, Canada, India, and the Netherlands were willing to see the general make some reductions in sentences. He chose not to do so. The issue of clemency was thereafter to disturb Japanese relations with the Allied powers until the late 1950s, when a majority of the Allied powers agreed to release the last of the convicted major war criminals from captivity.

==Other war crimes trials==
More than 5,700 lower-ranking personnel were charged with conventional war crimes in separate trials convened by Australia, China, France, the Netherlands Indies, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The charges covered a wide range of crimes including prisoner abuse, rape, sexual slavery, torture, ill-treatment of laborers, execution without trial, and inhumane medical experiments. The trials took place in around fifty locations in Asia and the Pacific. Most trials were completed by 1949, but Australia held some trials in 1951. China held 13 tribunals, resulting in 504 convictions and 149 executions. Of the 5,700 Japanese individuals indicted for Class B war crimes, 984 were sentenced to death; 475 received life sentences; 2,944 were given more limited prison terms; 1,018 were acquitted; and 279 were never brought to trial or not sentenced.

The Soviet Union and Chinese Communist forces also held trials of Japanese war criminals. The Khabarovsk War Crime Trials held by the Soviets tried and found guilty some members of Japan&#x27;s bacteriological and chemical warfare unit, also known as Unit 731. However, those who surrendered to the Americans were never brought to trial. As Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, MacArthur gave immunity to Shiro Ishii and all members of the bacteriological research units in exchange for germ warfare data based on human experimentation. On May 6, 1947, he wrote to Washington that &quot;additional data, possibly some statements from Ishii probably can be obtained by informing Japanese involved that information will be retained in intelligence channels and will not be employed as &#x27;War Crimes&#x27; evidence.&quot; The deal was concluded in 1948.

==Criticism==
===Charges of victors&#x27; justice===
The United States had provided the funds and staff necessary for running the Tribunal and also held the function of Chief Prosecutor. The argument was made that it was difficult, if not impossible, to uphold the requirement of impartiality with which such an organ should be invested. This apparent conflict gave the impression that the tribunal was no more than a means for the dispensation of victors&#x27; justice. Solis Horowitz argues that IMTFE had an American bias: unlike the Nuremberg trials, there was only a single prosecution team, led by an American, although the members of the tribunal represented eleven different Allied countries. The IMTFE had less official support than the Nuremberg trials. Keenan, a former U.S. assistant attorney general, had a much lower position than Nuremberg&#x27;s Robert H. Jackson, a justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.

Justice Jaranilla had been captured by the Japanese and survived the Bataan Death March. The defense sought to remove him from the bench claiming he would be unable to maintain objectivity. The request was rejected but Jaranilla did excuse himself from presentation of evidence for atrocities in his native country of the Philippines.

Justice Radhabinod Pal argued that the exclusion of Western colonialism and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the list of crimes and the lack of judges from the vanquished nations on the bench signified the &quot;failure of the Tribunal to provide anything other than the opportunity for the victors to retaliate&quot;. In this he was not alone among Indian jurists, with one prominent [Kolkata] barrister writing that the Tribunal was little more than &quot;a sword in a [judge&#x27;s] wig.&quot;

Justice Röling stated, &quot;[o]f course, in Japan we were all aware of the bombings and the burnings of Tokyo and Yokohama and other big cities. It was horrible that we went there for the purpose of vindicating the laws of war, and yet saw every day how the Allies had violated them dreadfully.&quot;

However, in respect to Pal and Röling&#x27;s statement about the conduct of air attacks, there was no positive or specific customary international humanitarian law with respect to aerial warfare before and during World War II. Ben Bruce Blakeney, an American defense counsel for Japanese defendants, argued that &quot;[i]f the killing of Admiral Kidd by the bombing of Pearl Harbor is murder, we know the name of the very man who[se] hands loosed the atomic bomb on Hiroshima,&quot; although Pearl Harbor was classified as a war crime under the 1907 Hague Convention, as it happened without a declaration of war and without a just cause for self-defense. 

Similarly, the indiscriminate bombing of Chinese cities by Japanese Imperial forces was never raised in the Tokyo Trials in fear of America being accused of the same thing for its air attacks on Japanese cities. As a result, Japanese pilots and officers were not prosecuted for their aerial raids on Pearl Harbor and cities in China and other Asian countries.

===Pal&#x27;s dissenting opinion===

Indian jurist Radhabinod Pal raised substantive objections in a dissenting opinion: he found the entire prosecution case to be weak regarding the conspiracy to commit an act of aggressive war, which would include the brutalization and subjugation of conquered nations. About the Nanking Massacre—while acknowledging the brutality of the incident—he said that there was nothing to show that it was the &quot;product of government policy&quot; or that Japanese government officials were directly responsible. There is &quot;no evidence, testimonial or circumstantial, concomitant, prospectant, restrospectant, that would in any way lead to the inference that the government in any way permitted the commission of such offences,&quot; he said. In any case, he added, conspiracy to wage aggressive war was not illegal in 1937, or at any point since. In addition, Pal thought the refusal to try what he perceived as Allied crimes (particularly the use of atomic bombs) weakened the tribunal&#x27;s authority. Recalling a letter by Kaiser Wilhelm II signalling his determination to bring World War I to a swift conclusion through brutal means if necessary, Pal stated that &quot;This policy of indiscriminate murder to shorten the war was considered to be a crime. In the Pacific war under our consideration, if there was anything approaching what is indicated in the above letter of the German Emperor, it is the decision coming from the Allied powers to use the bomb&quot;, adding that &quot;Future generations will judge this dire decision&quot;. Pal was the only judge to argue for the acquittal of all of the defendants.

===Exoneration of the imperial family===
The Japanese emperor Hirohito and other members of the imperial family might have been regarded as potential suspects. They included career officer Prince Yasuhiko Asaka, Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu, Prince Higashikuni, and Prince Takeda. Herbert Bix explained, &quot;The Truman Administration and General MacArthur both believed the occupation reforms would be implemented smoothly if they used Hirohito to legitimise their changes.&quot;

As early as November 26, 1945, MacArthur confirmed to Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai that the emperor&#x27;s abdication would not be necessary. Before the war crimes trials actually convened, SCAP, the International Prosecution Section (IPS), and court officials worked behind the scenes not only to prevent the imperial family from being indicted, but also to skew the testimony of the defendants to ensure that no one implicated the emperor. High officials in court circles and the Japanese government collaborated with Allied GHQ in compiling lists of prospective war criminals. People arrested as Class A suspects and incarcerated in the Sugamo Prison solemnly vowed to protect their sovereign against any possible taint of war responsibility.

According to historian Herbert Bix, Brigadier General Bonner Fellers &quot;immediately on landing in Japan went to work to protect Hirohito from the role he had played during and at the end of the war&quot; and &quot;allowed the major criminal suspects to coordinate their stories so that the emperor would be spared from indictment.&quot;

Bix also argues that &quot;MacArthur&#x27;s truly extraordinary measures to save Hirohito from trial as a war criminal had a lasting and profoundly distorting impact on Japanese understanding of the lost war&quot; and &quot;months before the Tokyo tribunal commenced, MacArthur&#x27;s highest subordinates were working to attribute ultimate responsibility for Pearl Harbor to Hideki Tōjō.&quot; According to a written report by Shūichi Mizota, Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai&#x27;s interpreter, Fellers met the two men at his office on March 6, 1946, and told Yonai, &quot;It would be most convenient if the Japanese side could prove to us that the emperor is completely blameless. I think the forthcoming trials offer the best opportunity to do that. Tōjō, in particular, should be made to bear all responsibility at this trial.&quot;

Historian John W. Dower wrote that the campaign to absolve Emperor Hirohito of responsibility &quot;knew no bounds.&quot; He argued that with MacArthur&#x27;s full approval, the prosecution effectively acted as &quot;a defense team for the emperor,&quot; who was presented as &quot;an almost saintly figure&quot; let alone someone culpable of war crimes. He stated, &quot;Even Japanese activists who endorse the ideals of the Nuremberg and Tokyo charters and who have labored to document and publicize the atrocities of the Shōwa regime cannot defend the American decision to exonerate the emperor of war responsibility and then, in the chill of the Cold War, release and soon afterwards openly embrace accused right-winged war criminals like the later prime minister Nobusuke Kishi.&quot;

Three justices wrote an &quot;obiter dictum&quot; about the criminal responsibility of Hirohito. Judge-in-Chief Webb declared, &quot;No ruler can commit the crime of launching aggressive war and then validly claim to be excused for doing so because his life would otherwise have been in danger ... It will remain that the men who advised the commission of a crime, if it be one, are in no worse position than the man who directs the crime be committed.&quot;

Justice Henri Bernard of France concluded that Japan&#x27;s declaration of war &quot;had a principal author who escaped all prosecution and of whom in any case the present Defendants could only be considered as accomplices.&quot;

Justice Röling did not find the emperor&#x27;s immunity objectionable and further argued that five defendants (Kido, Hata, Hirota, Shigemitsu, and Tōgō) should have been acquitted.

===Failure to prosecute perpetrators of inhumane medical experimentation===
Shirō Ishii, commander of Unit 731, received immunity in exchange for data gathered from his experiments on live prisoners. In 1981 John W. Powell published an article in the &quot;Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists&quot; detailing the experiments of Unit 731 and its open-air tests of germ warfare on civilians. It was printed with a statement by Judge Röling, the last surviving member of the Tokyo Tribunal, who wrote, &quot;As one of the judges in the International Military Tribunal, it is a bitter experience for me to be informed now that centrally ordered Japanese war criminality of the most disgusting kind was kept secret from the Court by the U.S. government&quot;.

===Failure to prosecute other suspects===
Forty-two suspects, such as Nobusuke Kishi, who later became Prime Minister, and Yoshisuke Aikawa, head of Nissan, were imprisoned in the expectation that they would be prosecuted at a second Tokyo Tribunal but they were never charged. They were released in 1947 and 1948.

===Failure to prosecute Japan&#x27;s atrocities against its nationals as crimes against humanity===
Despite Class C charges being created to prosecute Japan for atrocities against its nationals, this never occurred at all. Britain, France, Netherlands, and the U.S.—four-nation members of the Tokyo trials—had colonies themselves and feared that their own colonial atrocities might be brought to account for crimes against humanity. As a consequence, this left the Korean and Taiwanese victims of Japanese colonial atrocities without any recourse in the international legal system.

==Aftermath==
===Release of the remaining 42 &quot;Class A&quot; suspects===

The International Prosecution Section (IPS) of the SCAP decided to try the seventy Japanese apprehended for &quot;Class A&quot; war crimes in three groups. The first group of 28 were major leaders in the military, political, and diplomatic sphere. The second group (23 people) and the third group (nineteen people) were industrial and financial magnates who had been engaged in weapons manufacturing industries or were accused of trafficking in narcotics, as well as a number of lesser known leaders in military, political, and diplomatic spheres. The most notable among these were:
* Nobusuke Kishi: In charge of industry and commerce of Manchukuo, 1936–40; Minister of Industry and Commerce under Tojo administration.
* Fusanosuke Kuhara: Leader of the pro-Zaibatsu faction of Rikken Seiyukai.
* Yoshisuke Ayukawa: Sworn brother of Fusanosuke Kuhara, founder of Japan Industrial Corporation; went to Manchuria after the Mukden Incident (1931), at the invitation of his relative Nobusuke Kishi, where he founded the Manchurian Heavy Industry Development Company.
* Toshizō Nishio: Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Commander-in-Chief of China Expeditionary Army, 1939–41; war-time Minister of Education.
* Kisaburō Andō: Garrison Commander of Port Arthur and Minister of Interior in the Tojo cabinet.
* Yoshio Kodama: A radical ultranationalist. War profiteer, smuggler and underground crime boss.
* Ryōichi Sasakawa: Ultranationalist businessman and philanthropist.
* Kazuo Aoki: Administrator of Manchurian affairs; Minister of Treasury in Nobuyoki Abe&#x27;s cabinet; followed Abe to China as an advisor; Minister of Greater East Asia in the Tojo cabinet.
* Masayuki Tani: Ambassador to Manchukuo, Minister of Foreign Affairs and concurrently Director of the Intelligence Bureau; Ambassador to the Reorganized National Government of China.
* Eiji Amo: Chief of the Intelligence Section of Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs; Director of Intelligence Bureau in the Tojo cabinet.
* Yakichiro Suma: Consul General at Nanking; in 1938, he served as counselor at the Japanese Embassy in Washington; after 1941, Minister Plenipotentiary to Spain.

All remaining people apprehended and accused of Class A war crimes who had not yet come to trial were set free by MacArthur in 1947 and 1948.

===San Francisco Peace Treaty===
Under Article 11 of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, signed on September 8, 1951, Japan accepted the jurisdiction of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. Article 11 of the treaty reads:

===Parole for war criminals movement===
In 1950, after most Allied war crimes trials had ended, thousands of convicted war criminals sat in prisons across Asia and Europe, detained in the countries where they had been convicted. Some executions had not yet been carried out, as Allied courts agreed to reexamine their verdicts. Sentences were reduced in some cases, and a system of parole was instituted, but without relinquishing control over the fate of the imprisoned (even after Japan and Germany had regained their sovereignty).

The focus changed from the top wartime leaders to &quot;ordinary&quot; war criminals (Class B and C in Japan), and an intense campaign for amnesty for all imprisoned war criminals ensued which enjoyed widespread public support. The campaign reframed the issue of criminal responsibility as a humanitarian problem.

On March 7, 1950, MacArthur issued a directive that reduced the sentences by one-third for good behavior and authorized the parole after fifteen years of those who had received life sentences. Several of those who were imprisoned were released earlier on parole due to ill health.

Many Japanese reacted to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal by demanding parole for the detainees or mitigation of their sentences. Shortly after the San Francisco Peace Treaty came into effect, a movement demanding the release of B- and C-class war criminals began, emphasizing the &quot;unfairness of the war crimes tribunals&quot; and the &quot;misery and hardship of the families of war criminals.&quot; The movement quickly garnered the support of more than ten million Japanese. The government commented that &quot;public sentiment in our country is that the war criminals are not criminals. Rather, they gather great sympathy as victims of the war, and the number of people concerned about the war crimes tribunal system itself is steadily increasing.&quot;

The parole for war criminals movement was driven by two groups: people who had &quot;a sense of pity&quot; for the prisoners demanded, &quot;Just set them free&quot; (&quot;tonikaku shakuho o&quot;) regardless of how it is done. The war criminals themselves called for their own release as part of an anti-war peace movement.

On September 4, 1952, President Truman issued Executive Order 10393, establishing a Clemency and Parole Board for War Criminals. Its purpose was to advise the President regarding recommendations by the Government of Japan for clemency, reduction of sentence, or parole of Japanese war criminals sentenced by military tribunals.

On May 26, 1954, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles rejected a proposed amnesty for the imprisoned war criminals but instead agreed to &quot;change the ground rules&quot; by reducing the period required for eligibility for parole from 15 years to 10 years.

By the end of 1958, all Japanese war criminals were released from prison and politically rehabilitated. Hashimoto Kingorô, Hata Shunroku, Minami Jirô, and Oka Takazumi were all released on parole in 1954. Araki Sadao, Hiranuma Kiichirô, Hoshino Naoki, Kaya Okinori, Kido Kôichi, Ôshima Hiroshi, Shimada Shigetarô, and Suzuki Teiichi were released on parole in 1955. Satô Kenryô was not granted parole until March 1956, the last of the Class A Japanese war criminals to be released. With the concurrence of a majority of the powers represented on the tribunal, the Japanese government announced on April 7, 1957, that the last ten major Japanese war criminals who had previously been paroled were granted clemency and were to be regarded henceforth as unconditionally free.

==Legacy==
In 1978, the &quot;kami&quot; of 1,068 convicted war criminals, including the kami of 14 convicted Class-A war criminals, were secretly enshrined in the Yasukuni Shrine. Those enshrined include Hideki Tōjō, Kenji Doihara, Iwane Matsui, Heitarō Kimura, Kōki Hirota, Seishirō Itagaki, Akira Mutō, Yosuke Matsuoka, Osami Nagano, Toshio Shiratori, Kiichirō Hiranuma, Kuniaki Koiso and Yoshijirō Umezu. Since 1985, visits made by Japanese government officials to the Shrine have aroused protests in China and South Korea.

Arnold Brackman, who had covered the trials for United Press International, wrote &quot;The Other Nuremberg: The Untold Story of the Tokyo War Crimes Trial,&quot; a rebuttal of charges that the trial had been &quot;victor&#x27;s justice&quot;; this rebuttal was posthumously published in 1987, four years after Arnold Brackman&#x27;s death.

In a survey of 3,000 Japanese people which was conducted by &quot;Asahi News&quot; as the 60th anniversary of the start of the trial approached in 2006, 70% of those who were questioned were unaware of the details of the trial, a figure that rose to 90% among those who were in the 20–29 age group. Some 76% of the people who were polled recognized the fact that a degree of the aggression which was perpetrated during the war was perpetrated by Japan, while only 7% of them believed that the war was a war which was strictly waged for the purpose of self-defense.

A South Korean government commission cleared 83 of the 148 Koreans who were convicted of war crimes by the Allies. The commission ruled that the Koreans, who were categorized as Class B and Class C war criminals, were actually victims of Japanese imperialism.

===Potential concerns expressed by the Japanese Imperial Family===
Some time before the situation emerged about his expected accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne at the end of April 2019, some degree of concern was voiced by the then Crown Prince Naruhito on the occasion of his 55th birthday in February 2015 about how Japanese history with regard to its involvement in World War II would be remembered by his future subjects; as Naruhito put it at that time: it was &quot;important to look back on the past humbly and correctly,&quot; in reference to Japan&#x27;s role in World War II-era war crimes and that he was concerned about the ongoing need to, in his own words: &quot;correctly pass down tragic experiences and the history behind Japan to the generations who have no direct knowledge of the war, at the time memories of the war are about to fade.&quot;

==List of judges, prosecutors, and defendants==
===Judges===
MacArthur appointed a panel of 11 judges, nine from the nations that signed the Instrument of Surrender.

<text>The Global Environment Facility (GEF) is a multilateral environmental fund that provides grants and blended finance for projects related to biodiversity, climate change, international waters, land degradation, persistent organic pollutants (POPs), mercury, sustainable forest management, food security, and sustainable cities in developing countries and countries with economies in transition. It is the largest source of multilateral funding for biodiversity globally and distributes more than $1 billion a year on average to address inter-related environmental challenges.

The GEF was established ahead of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit and includes 184 countries in partnership with international institutions, civil society organizations, and the private sector. It supports country-driven sustainable development initiatives in developing countries that generate global environmental benefits. To date, the GEF has provided more than $22 billion in grants and mobilized another $120 billion in co-financing for more than 5,200 projects and programs. Through its Small Grants Programme (SGP), the GEF has provided support to nearly 27,000 civil society and community initiatives in 136 countries. In June 2022, donors to the GEF pledged a record $5.33 billion in support for its latest four-year replenishment cycle, which runs until June 2026.

In addition to funding projects through grants and blended finance, the GEF also serves as a financial mechanism for the following conventions:
* Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)
* United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)
* United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)
* Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants
* Minamata Convention on Mercury
The GEF also supports implementation of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (MP).

== Structure ==

The GEF has a governing structure organized around an Assembly, the Council, the Secretariat, 18 Agencies, a Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP), and the Independent Evaluation Office.
* The GEF Assembly is composed of all 184 member countries, or Participants. It meets every three to four years at the ministerial level to review general policies; review and evaluate the GEF&#x27;s operation based on reports submitted to Council; review the membership of the Facility; and consider, for approval by consensus, amendments to the &quot;Instrument for the Establishment of the Restructured GEF&quot; on the basis of recommendations by the Council&quot;.&quot; Ministers and high-level government delegations of all GEF member countries take part in the meetings. The Assembly combines plenary meetings and high-level panels, exhibits, side events, and GEF project site visits. Prominent environmentalists, parliamentarians, business leaders, scientists, and NGO leaders discuss global environmental challenges within the context of sustainable development and other international development goals.
* The GEF Council is the main governing body of the GEF. It comprises 32 members appointed by constituencies of GEF member countries (14 from developed countries, 16 from developing countries and 2 from economies in transition). Council Members rotate every three years or until the constituency appoints a new Member. The Council, which meets twice annually, develops, adopts, and evaluates the operational policies and programs for GEF-financed activities. It also reviews and approves the work program (projects submitted for approval), making decisions by consensus.
* The GEF Secretariat is based in Washington, D.C., and reports directly to the GEF Council and Assembly, ensuring that their decisions are translated into effective actions. The Secretariat coordinates the formulation of projects included in the work programs, oversees its implementation, and makes certain that operational strategy and policies are followed. The CEO and Chairperson, Carlos Manuel Rodriguez heads the Secretariat.
* The GEF Scientific and Technical Advisory Panel (STAP) provides the GEF with scientific and technical advice on policies, operational strategies, programs, and projects. The Panel consists of six members, who are internationally recognized experts in the GEF&#x27;s key areas of work. They are supported by a global network of experts and institutions. In addition, the STAP interacts with other relevant scientific and technical bodies, particularly with the subsidiary bodies of the environmental conventions.
* The GEF Independent Evaluation Office (GEF IEO) reports directly to the Council. It is headed by a Director, appointed by the Council, who coordinates a team of specialized evaluators. It works with the Secretariat and the GEF Agencies to share lessons learned and best practices. The IEO undertakes independent evaluations of GEF impact and effectiveness. These are typically on focal areas, institutional issues, or cross-cutting themes.
* GEF Agencies are the operational arm of the GEF. They work closely with project proponents—government agencies, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders—to design, develop and implement GEF-funded projects and programs. The GEF works with 18 agencies.

==History==

The Global Environment Facility was established in October 1991 under the chairmanship of Mohamed El-Ashry as a $1 billion pilot program in the World Bank to enable developing countries to take action on environmental challenges and to promote sustainable development. The GEF would provide new and additional grants and concessional funding to cover the &quot;incremental&quot; or additional costs associated with transforming a project with national benefits into one with global environmental benefits.
The United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Environment Programme, and the World Bank were the three initial partners implementing GEF projects.

In 1992, at the Rio Earth Summit, the GEF was restructured and established as a permanent, separate institution. The decision to make the GEF an independent organization enhanced the involvement of developing countries in the decision-making process and in implementation of the projects. Since 1994, the World Bank has served as the Trustee of the GEF Trust Fund and provides administrative services.
As part of the restructuring, the GEF was entrusted to become the financial mechanism for both the UN Convention on Biological Diversity and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. In partnership with The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, the GEF started funding projects that enable the Russian Federation and nations in Eastern Europe and Central Asia to phase out their use of ozone-destroying chemicals.

In 1998, the GEF Council decided to expand beyond the initial three implementing agencies, including the International Finance Corporation, to broaden its ability to enable innovating financing mechanisms and better leverage private sector investment. The GEF subsequently was also selected to serve as financial mechanism for three more international conventions: The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (2001), the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (2003), and the Minamata Convention on Mercury (2013).

== Areas of work ==
The GEF work focuses on six main areas, including biodiversity, climate change (mitigation and adaptation), chemicals and waste, international waters, land degradation, and sustainable forest management.

Biodiversity: Biodiversity is under heavy threat. Reducing and preventing further biodiversity loss are considered among the most critical challenges to humankind. Of all the problems the world faces in managing “global goods,” only the loss of biodiversity is irreversible. The GEF supports projects that address the key drivers of biodiversity loss which focus on the highest leveraging opportunities to achieve sustainable biodiversity conservation.

Climate change: Climate change from human-induced emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases (GHGs) is a critical global issue, requiring substantial action. These actions include investment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, and adaptation to climate changes including variability. The early impacts of climate change have already appeared, and scientists believe that further impacts are inevitable. Many of the most serious and negative impacts of climate change will be disproportionately borne by the poorest people in developing countries. The GEF supports projects in developing countries.
* Climate change mitigation: Reducing or avoiding greenhouse gas emissions in the areas of renewable energy; energy efficiency; sustainable transport; and management of land use, land-use change, and forestry.
* Climate change adaptation: Aiming at developing countries to become climate-resilient by promoting immediate and longer-term adaptation measures in development policies, plans, programs, projects, and actions.

Chemicals: Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are pesticides, industrial chemicals, or unwanted by-products of industrial processes that have been used for decades but have more recently been found to share a number of disturbing characteristics, including:
* Persistence – they resist degradation in air, water, and sediments;
* Bio-accumulation – they accumulate in living tissues at concentrations higher than those in the surrounding environment;
* Long-range transport – they can travel great distances from the source of release through air, water, and migratory animals, often contaminating areas thousands of kilometers away from any known source.

The GEF supports projects working to eliminate the production and use of specific POPs, taking measures to ensure that they are managed and disposed of in an environmentally sound manner, identifying the sources, and reducing releases of POPs byproducts.

Circular Economy: GEF has hosted events on the circular economy, which shifts from a take-make-waste economy to one that seeks to use no non-renewable source materials and produce zero waste. GEF is a member of the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE).

International waters: Diversions of water for irrigation, bulk supply, and potable use, together with the pollution of common water bodies are creating cross-border tensions. These tensions also persist across the oceans, with three-quarters of fish stocks being overfished, fished at their maximum, or in a depleted state. The GEF supports projects in helping countries work together to overcome these tensions in large water systems and to collectively manage their transboundary surface water basins, groundwater basins, and coastal and marine systems in order to share the benefits from them.

Land degradation: Land degradation is a major threat to biodiversity, ecosystem stability, and society&#x27;s ability to function. Because of the interconnectivity between ecosystems across scales, land degradation triggers destructive processes that can have cascading effects across the entire biosphere. Loss of biomass through vegetation clearance and increased soil erosion produces greenhouse gases that contribute global warming and climate change. The GEF supports projects in reversing and preventing desertification/land degradation and in mitigating the effects of drought in affected areas in order to support poverty reduction and environmental sustainability.

Sustainable forest management / Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation+: Forests cover almost one-third of the world&#x27;s land area. They have a unique potential to produce multiple global environmental benefits such as biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration, and protection against desertification. Sustainably managed forests can enhance the provision of wood and non-timber forest products for about 1.6 billion people depending on forests for their livelihoods. Forest ecosystems are also expected to play a key role in helping people in developing countries to adapt to the effects of climate change. The GEF supports projects in forest conservation (primarily protected areas and buffer zones), sustainable use of forests (forest production landscapes, sustainable forest management), and addressing forests and trees in the wider landscape.

In addition to these thematic areas, the GEF has works to support: 
* Capacity development 
* Debt-for-nature swaps
* Gender equality 
* Indigenous Peoples and traditional knowledge 
* Results and learning
* Small Island Developing States

==Small Grants Programme==
The GEF runs a Small Grants Programme that provides financial and technical support to projects which embody a community-based approach. The GEF sees community based projects as the cornerstone for addressing local and global environmental and sustainable development challenges.

<doc id="367278" wikidata="Q6494115" url="?curid=367278" title="Last Amendment">
<text>Last Amendment, formerly known as The Crass Collective and Crass Agenda, is the working title of a series of collaborations by ex-members of the anarcho-punk band Crass and others. Although Crass had formally split up in 1984, Penny Rimbaud, Gee Vaucher, Eve Libertine, Steve Ignorant, Andy Palmer and Pete Wright came together in November 2002 to put on a concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in opposition to the at that time proposed War on Iraq. Although they did not all appear on the stage at the same time, most of the ex-members of Crass participated in the event under the name of The Crass Collective, along with other performers such as Ian MacKaye, Goldblade, the English Chamber Choir, Fun Da Mental, and Nabil Shaban, among others.

The Crass Collective continued to put on gigs and performances, usually of a collaborative nature, on a regular basis throughout 2003 at the Vortex Club in Stoke Newington, London. In October of that year however they changed the name of the project to Crass Agenda. Works by the collective have included Dada cabaret, an interpretation of Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s poem &quot;Howl&quot;, Crass&#x27; &quot;Yes Sir I Will&quot; and an update of Dylan Thomas&#x27; play &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot;, in which property developers move into the mythical Welsh village of Llareggub.

Others that have worked as part of Crass Collective/Crass Agenda include disability rights advocate and actor Nabil Shaban, violinist and pianist Dylan Bates, saxophone player Ingrid Laubrock, John Sharian, Julian Siegel, Gene Calderazzo, Kate Shortt, guitarist and bass player Jennifer Maidman, Ed Jones, A-Soma and others. During 2004 Crass Agenda were at the forefront of a campaign against the closure of the Vortex jazz club, which has now relocated to Hackney.

In June 2005 the project was renamed Last Amendment, with their website, declaring the name Crass Agenda as being &quot;no more&quot;. Their first live performance using this incarnation was on 30 June at the New Vortex club in Hackney, east London.

<text>Several theories, in great extent mutually exclusive, address the issue of the origin of the Romanians. The Romanian language descends from the Vulgar Latin dialects spoken in the Roman provinces north of the &quot;Jireček Line&quot; (a proposed notional line separating the predominantly Latin-speaking territories from the Greek-speaking lands in Southeastern Europe) in Late Antiquity. The theory of Daco-Roman continuity argues that the Romanians are mainly descended from the Daco-Romans, a people developing through the cohabitation of the native Dacians and the Roman colonists in the province of Dacia Traiana (primarily in present-day Romania) north of the river Danube. The competing immigrationist theory states that the Romanians&#x27; ethnogenesis commenced in the provinces south of the river with Romanized local populations (known as Vlachs in the Middle Ages) spreading through mountain refuges, both south to Greece and north through the Carpathian Mountains. Other theories state that the Romanized local populations were present over a wide area on both sides of the Danube and the river itself did not constitute an obstacle to permanent exchanges in both directions; according to the &quot;admigration&quot; theory, migrations from the Balkan Peninsula to the lands north of the Danube contributed to the survival of the Romance-speaking population in these territories.

Political motivationsthe Transylvanian Romanians&#x27; efforts to achieve their emancipation, Austro-Hungarian and Romanian expansionism, and Hungarian irredentisminfluenced the development of the theories, and &quot;national passions&quot; still color the debates. In 2013, authors of &quot;The Cambridge History of the Romance Languages&quot; came to the conclusion that the &quot;historical, archaeological and linguistic data available do not seem adequate to give a definitive answer&quot; in the debate. Their view was accepted by scholars contributing to &quot;The Oxford Guide to the Romance Languages&quot;, published in 2016, which reiterates that &quot;the location and extent of the territory where &quot;Daco-Romance&quot; originated&quot; is uncertain.

==Historic background==


Three major ethnic groupsthe Dacians, Illyrians and Thraciansinhabited the northern regions of Southeastern Europe in Antiquity. Modern knowledge of their languages is based on limited evidence (primarily on proper names), making all scholarly theories proposing a strong relationship between the three languages or between Thracian and Dacian speculative.

The Illyrians were the first to be conquered by the Romans, who organized their territory into the province of Illyricum around 60 BC. In the lands inhabited by Thracians, the Romans set up the province of Moesia in 6 AD, and Thracia forty years later. The territory between the Lower Danube and the Black Sea (now Dobruja in Romania and Bulgaria) was attached to Moesia in 46.

The Romans annihilated the Dacian kingdom to the north of the Lower Danube under Emperor Trajan in 106. Its western territories were organized into the province of Dacia (or &quot;Dacia Traiana&quot;), but Maramureș and further regions inhabited by the Costoboci, Bastarnae and other tribes remained free of Roman rule. The Romans officially abandoned Dacia under Emperor Aurelian (&quot;r.&quot; 270–275). Along with the abandonment of Dacia, Aurelian organized a new province bearing the same name (&quot;Dacia Aureliana&quot;) south of the Lower Danube. Roman forts were erected north of the river in the 320s, but the river became the boundary between the empire and the Goths in the 360s. Meanwhile, from 313 under the Edict of Milan, the Roman Empire began to transform itself into a Christian state. Roman emperors supported Christian missionaries in the north-Danubian territories which were dominated by the Goths from the 340s.

The Huns destroyed all these territories between 376 and 406, but their empire also collapsed in 453. Thereafter the Gepids exercised control over Banat, Crișana, and Transylvania. The Bulgars, Antes, Sclavenes and other tribes made frequent raids across the Lower Danube against the Balkans in the 6th century. The Roman Empire revived under Emperor Justinian I (&quot;r.&quot; 527–565), but the Avars, who had subjugated the Gepids, invaded the Balkans from the 580s. In 30 years all Roman troops were withdrawn from the peninsula, where only Dyrrhachium, Thessaloniki and a few other towns remained under Roman rule.

The next arrivals, the Bulgars, established their own state on the Lower Danube in 681. Their territorial expansion accelerated after the collapse of the Avar Khaganate in the 790s. The ruler of the First Bulgarian Empire, Boris I (&quot;r.&quot; 852–889) converted to Christianity in 864. A synod of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church promoted a liturgy in Old Church Slavonic in 893.

Bulgaria was invaded by the Magyars (or Hungarians) in 894, but a joint counter-attack by the Bulgars and the Pechenegsa nomadic Turkic peopleforced the Magyars to find a new homeland in the Carpathian Basin. Historians still debate whether they encountered a Romanian population in the territory. The Byzantines occupied the greater part of Bulgaria under Emperor John I Tzimiskes (&quot;r.&quot; 969–976). The Bulgars regained their independence during the reign of Samuel (&quot;r.&quot; 997–1014), but Emperor Basil II of Byzantium conquered their country around 1018.

The Hungarians&#x27; supreme ruler, Stephen, was baptized according to the Western rite. He expanded his rule over new territories, including Banat. Pecheneg groups, pushed by the Ouzesa coalition of Turkic nomadssought asylum in the Byzantine Empire in the 1040s. After the Ouzes there followed the Cumansalso a Turkic confederationwho took control of the Pontic steppes in the 1070s. Thereafter, specific groups, including the Hungarian-speaking Székelys and the Pechenegs, defended the frontiers of the Kingdom of Hungary against them. The arrival of mostly German-speaking colonists in the 1150s also reinforced the Hungarian monarch&#x27;s rule in the region.

The Byzantine authorities introduced new taxes, provoking an uprising in the Balkan Mountains in 1185. The local Bulgarians and Vlachs achieved their independence and established the Second Bulgarian Empire in coalition with the Cumans. A chieftain of the western Cuman tribes accepted Hungarian supremacy in 1227. The Hungarian expansion towards the Pontic steppes was halted by the large Mongol campaign against Eastern and Central Europe in 1241. Although the Mongols withdrew in a year, their invasion caused destruction throughout the region.

The unification of small polities ruled by local Romanian leaders in Oltenia and Muntenia led to the establishment of a new principality, Wallachia. It achieved independence under Basarab the Founder, who defeated a Hungarian army in the battle of Posada in 1330. A second principality, Moldavia, became independent in the 1360s under Bogdan I, a Romanian nobleman from the Voivodeship of Maramureș.

==Theories on the Romanians&#x27; ethnogenesis==

Romanians, known by the exonym Vlachs in the Middle Ages, speak a language descended from the Vulgar Latin that was once spoken in south-eastern Europe. Inscriptions from the Roman period show that a line, known as the &quot;Jireček Line&quot;, can be drawn through the Balkan Peninsula, which separated the Latin-speaking northern provinces, including Dacia, Moesia and Pannonia from the southern regions where Greek remained the predominant language. Eastern Romance now has four variants, which are former dialects of a Proto-Romanian language. Daco-Romanian, the official language of Romania, is the most widespread of the four variants. Speakers of the Aromanian language live in scattered communities in Albania, Bulgaria, Greece and North Macedonia. Another two, by now nearly extinct variants, Megleno-Romanian and Istro-Romanian, are spoken in some villages in North Macedonia and Greece, and in Croatia, respectively. Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian are spoken in the central and southern regions of the Balkans (to the south of the Jireček Line), indicating that they migrated to these territories in the Middle Ages.

Among the first to note the Latin character of the language were Italian humanists Poggio Bracciolini and Flavio Biondo. One of the first scholars who systematically studied the Romance languages, Friedrich Christian Diez (1797–1876), described Romanian as a semi-Romance language in the 1830s. In his &quot;Grammar of the Romance Languages&quot; (1836) Diez highlights six languages of the Romance area which attract attention, in terms of their grammatical or literary significance: Italian and Romanian, Spanish and Portuguese, Provençal and French. All six languages have their first and common source in Latin, a language which is &#x27;still intertwined with our civilization&#x27;. Harald Haarmann considers that any discussion about the position of Romanian within the Romance philology was definitely decided with the Grammar of Diez. After the publication of his &quot;Grammar of the Romance Languages&quot;, Romanian is always listed among the Romance languages.
In 2009, Kim Schulte likewise argued that &quot;Romanian is a language with a hybrid vocabulary&quot;. The proportion of loanwords in Romanian is indeed higher than in other Romance languages. Its certain structural featuressuch as the construction of the future tensealso distinguish Romanian from other Romance languages. Some peculiarities connect it to Albanian, Bulgarian and other tongues spoken in the Balkan Peninsula. Nevertheless, as linguist Graham Mallinson emphasizes, Romanian &quot;retains enough of its Latin heritage at all linguistic levels to qualify for membership of the Romance family in its own right&quot;, even without taking into account the &quot;re-Romancing tendency&quot; during its recent history.

The territories south of the Danube were subject to the Romanization process for about 800 years, while Dacia province to the north of the river was only for 165 years under Roman rule, which caused &quot;a certain disaccord between the effective process of Roman expansion and Romanization and the present ethnic configuration of Southeastern Europe&quot;, according to Lucian Boia. Political and ideological considerations, including the dispute between Hungary and Romania over Transylvania, have also colored these scholarly discussions.

Accordingly, theories on the Romanian &quot;Urheimat&quot; or &quot;homeland&quot; can be divided into two or more groups, including the theory of Daco-Roman continuity of the continuous presence of the Romanians&#x27; ancestors in the lands north of the Lower Danube and the opposite immigrationist theory. Independently of the theories, a number of scholars propose that Romanian developed from the tongue of a bilingual population, because bilingualism is the most probable explanation for its peculiarities.

===Historiography: origin of the theories===
Byzantine authors were the first to write of the Romanians (or Vlachs). The 11th-century scholar Kekaumenos wrote of a Vlach homeland situated &quot;near the Danube and [...] the Sava, where the Serbians lived more recently&quot;. He associates the Vlachs with the Dacians and the Bessi. Accordingly, historians have located this homeland in several places, including Pannonia Inferior and Dacia Aureliana. When associating the Vlachs with ancient ethnic groups, Kekaumenos followed the practice of Byzantine authors who named contemporary peoples for peoples known from ancient sources. The 12th-century scholar John Kinnamos wrote that the Vlachs &quot;are said to be formerly colonists from the people of Italy&quot;. William of Rubruck wrote that the Vlachs of Bulgaria descended from the &quot;Ulac&quot; people, who lived beyond Bashkiria. According to Victor Spinei, Rubruck&#x27;s words imply that he regarded the Vlachs a migrant population, coming from the region of the Volga like their Hungarian and Bulgarian neighbors. The late 13th-century Hungarian chronicler Simon of Kéza states that the Vlachs (&quot;Blackis&quot;) were &quot;shepherds and husbandmen of the Huns&quot; who &quot;remained in Pannonia&quot;. An unknown author&#x27;s &quot;Description of Eastern Europe&quot; from 1308 likewise states that the Balkan Vlachs &quot;were once the shepherds of the Romans&quot; who fled Hungary and &quot;had over them ten powerful kings in the entire Messia and Pannonia&quot;.

Poggio Bracciolini, an Italian scholar was the first to write (around 1450) that the Romanians&#x27; ancestors had been Roman colonists settled in Dacia Traiana. In 1458, Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini stated in his work &quot;De Europa&quot; (1458) that the Vlachs were a &quot;genus Italicum&quot; (&quot;an Italian race&quot;) and were named after one Pomponius Flaccus, a commander sent against the Dacians. Piccolomini&#x27;s version of the Vlachs&#x27; origin from Roman settlers in Dacia Traiana was repeated by many scholarsincluding the Italian Flavio Biondo and Pietro Ranzano, the Transylvanian Saxon Johannes Lebelius and the Hungarian István Szántó in the subsequent century. Laonikos Chalkokondylesa late-15th-century Byzantine scholarstated that he never heard anyone &quot;explain clearly where&quot; the Romanians &quot;came from to inhabit&quot; their lands. Chalkokondyles wrote: &quot;the race that inhabits Dacia and the mount Pindus also spread into Thessaly: both groups are called Vlachs, but I cannot tell which group migrated to the region of the other&quot; claiming also that it is said they have come &quot;from many places and settled that area&quot;. This means Chalkokondyles knew that the Balkan Romanians were of common origin. He also says that the Dacians&#x27; language is &quot;similar to Italian but very altered&quot; and that their country &quot;stretches from &quot;Ardelion&quot;, in the Paionian Dacia, to the Black Sea&quot;. The 17th-century Johannes Lucius expressed his concerns about the survival of Romans in the territory of the former Dacia Traiana province, exposed to invasions for a millennium.

A legend on the origin of the Moldavians, preserved in the &quot;Moldo-Russian Chronicle&quot; from around 1505, narrates that one &quot;King Vladislav of Hungary&quot; invited their Romanian ancestors to his kingdom and settled them &quot;in Maramureș between the &quot;Moreș&quot; and Tisa at a place called &quot;Crij&quot;&quot;. &quot;Logofăt&quot; Istratie and other 17th-century Moldavian historians continued to credit &quot;King Vladislav&quot; with the settlement of the Romanians&#x27; ancestors in Maramureș. Grigore Ureche&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle of Moldavia&quot; of 1647 is the first Romanian historical work stating that the Romanians &quot;all come from &quot;Rîm&quot;&quot; (Rome). In 30 years Miron Costin explicitly connected the Romanians&#x27; ethnogenesis to the conquest of &quot;Dacia Traiana&quot;. The oldest Muntenian chronicle, the &quot;Letopisețul Cantacuzinesc&quot;, preserving significant popular tradition among Wallachians, wrote &quot;But first the Romanians splitting up from the Romans wandered to the north, their chief being Trajan and his son Siverie, crossing the waters of the Danube, some settled at Turnu Severin; others, along the waters of the Olt, the Mureș and the Tisza; and still others in Hungary, reaching as far as Maramureș. Those who settled at Turnu Severin, extended along the foot of the mountains to the waters of the Olt, and others wandered downward along the Danube, and thus all places having been filled with them&quot;. According to Grecescu, Simonescu and Djuvara, the author of the &quot;Letopisețul Cantacuzinesc&quot; is describing the conquest of Dacia by Trajan, which started with the crossing of the Danube in the area of Turnu Severin, arriving up to Maramureș. Constantin Cantacuzino stated in 1716 that the native Dacians also had a role in the formation of the Romanian people. Petru Maior and other historians of the &quot;Transylvanian School&quot; flatly denied any interbreeding between the natives and the conquerors, claiming that the autochthonous Dacian population which was not eradicated by the Romans fled the territory. The Daco-Roman mixing became widely accepted in the Romanian historiography around 1800. This view is advocated by the Greek-origin historians Dimitrie Philippide in his work &quot;History of Romania&quot; (1816) and Dionisie Fotino, who wrote &quot;History of Dacia&quot; (1818). The idea was accepted and taught in the Habsburg monarchy, including Hungary until the 1870s, although the Austrian Franz Joseph Sulzer had by the 1780s rejected any form of continuity north of the Danube, and instead proposed a 13th-century migration from the Balkans.

The development of the theories was closely connected to political debates in the . Important historians of this time theorized Romanian migration from the Balkans. Sulzer&#x27;s theory was apparently connected to his plans on the annexation of Wallachia and Moldavia by the Habsburg Monarchy, and the settlement of German colonists in both principalities. The three political &quot;nations&quot; of the Principality of Transylvania, actually meaning: its Estates (Hungarian nobility, and the leading classes of the free Saxons and Székelys, which excluded serfs of all these ethnicities) enjoyed special privileges, while local legislation emphasized that the Romanians had been &quot;admitted into the country for the public good&quot; and they were only &quot;tolerated for the benefit of the country&quot;. When suggesting that the Romanians of Transylvania were the direct descendants of the Roman colonists in Emperor Trajan&#x27;s Dacia, the historians of the &quot;Transylvanian School&quot; also demanded that the Romanians were to be regarded as the oldest residents of the country. The &quot;Supplex Libellus Valachorum&quot;a petition completed by the representatives of the local Romanians in 1791explicitly demanded that the Romanians should be granted the same legal status that the three privileged &quot;nations&quot; had enjoyed because the Romanians were of Roman stock.

The concept of the common origin of the Romanians of the Habsburg Empire, Moldavia and Wallachia inevitably gave rise to the development of the idea of a united Romanian state. A series of &quot;Dacian&quot; projects about the unification of all lands inhabited by Romanians emerged in the 19th century. Moise Nicoară was the first to claim that the Romanian nation extends &quot;from the Tisza to the Black Sea, from the Danube to the Dniester&quot; in 1815. After irredentism became an important element of political debates among Romanian nationalists in the 1890s, the continuity theory &quot;added a considerable element of historical prestige to Romanian claims to Transylvania&quot;. After World War I, the peace treaties confirmed Romania&#x27;s new borders, acknowledging the incorporation of Transylvania, Bukovina and some neighboring regions in Greater Romania. Debates about the venue of the formation of the Romanian people became especially passionate after Hitler enforced the restoration of northern Transylvania to Hungary in 1940. Hungarian scholars published a series of detailed studies to disprove the continuity theory, and the Romanians did not fail to take issue with them.

After some oscillations in the 1950s, the strictest variant of the continuity theory became dominant in Communist Romania. Official historians claimed that the formation of the Romanian people started in the lands within the actual Romanian borders, stating that the south-Danubian territories had only had a role during the preceding &quot;Romanic&quot; phase of the Romanians&#x27; ethnogenesis. Nicolae Ceaușescu made history one of the &quot;pillars of national Communism&quot; in the 1970s. To meet his expectations, historians started to diminish the role of Slavs, and even of Romans, emphasizing the authochthonous character of Romanian culture and society. On the other hand, the Hungarian Academy of Sciences published a three-volume monography about the history of Transylvania in 1986, presenting the arguments of the immigrationist theory. The Hungarian government had supported its publication and the Minister of Education, the linguist and historian, Béla Köpeczi, was the general editor of the volumes. The historian Keith Hitchins notes that the controversy &quot;has lasted down to the post-Communist era&quot;, but it &quot;has assumed an attenuated form as membership in the European Union has softened territorial rivalries between Romania and Hungary&quot;. According to Vlad Georgescu, Bulgarian historians tend to support the continuity theory, but also to diminish the Vlachs&#x27; role in the history of the Balkans, while most Russian historians accept the continuous presence of the Romanians&#x27; ancestors in Transylvania and Banat, but deny any form of continuity in Moldova. Linguist Gottfried Schramm emphasizes that the Romanians&#x27; ethnogenesis is a &quot;fundamental problem of the history and linguistic history of Southeastern Europe&quot; and urges scholars from third countries to start studying it.

===Theory of Daco-Roman continuity===

Scholars supporting the continuity theory argue that the Romanians descended primarily from the Daco-Romans, a people developing through the cohabitation of the native Dacians and the Roman colonists in the province of Dacia Traiana (primarily in present-day Romania) north of the river Danube. The province encompassed three regions of present-day Romania (Oltenia, Banat, and Transylvania) to the north of the Lower Danube from 106.

In these scholars&#x27; view, the close contacts between the autochthonous Dacians and the Roman colonists led to the formation of the Romanian people because masses of provincials stayed behind after the Roman Empire abandoned the province in the early 270s. Thereafter the process of Romanization expanded to the neighboring regions due to the free movement of people across the former imperial borders. The spread of Christianity contributed to the process, since Latin was the language of liturgy among the Daco-Romans. The Romans held bridgeheads north of the Lower Danube, keeping Dacia within their sphere of influence uninterruptedly until 376.

Proponents of the theory argues that the north-Danubian regions remained the main &quot;center of Romanization&quot; after the Slavs started assimilating the Latin-speaking population in the lands south of the Danube, or forcing them to move even further south in the 7th century. The natural barriers of the Carpathian Mountains allowed the Daco-Romans to preserve their cultural and linguistic identity while other peoples in the region were assimilated by various migratory tribes. Although for a millennium migratory peoples invaded the territory, a sedentary Christian Romance-speaking population survived, primarily in the densely forested areas, separated from the &quot;heretic&quot; or pagan invaders. Only the &quot;semisedentarian&quot; Slavs exerted some influence on the Romanians&#x27; ancestors, especially after they adopted Orthodox Christianity in the 9th century. They played the role in the Romanians&#x27; ethnogenesis that the Germanic peoples had played in the formation of other Romance peoples.

Historians who accept the continuity theory emphasize that the Romanians &quot;form the numerically largest people&quot; in southeastern Europe. Romanian ethnographers point at the &quot;striking similarities&quot; between the traditional Romanian folk dress and the Dacian dress depicted on Trajan&#x27;s Column as clear evidence for the connection between the ancient Dacians and modern Romanians. They also highlight the importance of the massive and organized colonization of Dacia Traiana. One of them, Coriolan H. Opreanu underlines that &quot;nowhere else has anyone defied reason by stating that a [Romance] people, twice as numerous as any of its neighbours..., is only accidentally inhabiting the territory of a former Roman province, once home to a numerous and strongly Romanized population&quot;.

With the colonists coming from many provinces and living side by side with the natives, Latin must have emerged as their common language. The Dacians willingly adopted the conquerors&#x27; &quot;superior&quot; culture and they spoke Latin as their native tongue after two or three generations. Estimating the provincials&#x27; number at 500,000-1,000,000 in the 270s, supporters of the continuity theory rule out the possibility that masses of Latin-speaking commoners abandoned the province when the Roman troops and officials left it, as according to them the complete relocation of a population of that size was not logistically possible. After the abandonment of Dacia by the Roman army and administration and the frequent invasions of barbarians, the Daco-Roman population moved from the plains and river valleys to mountainous and hilly areas with better natural defenses. In this regard, on the first plan in the economy was put forward animal husbandry with the existence of agriculture and some crafts, and the settlements became small and relatively short-lived. Historian Ioan-Aurel Pop concludes that the relocation of hundreds of thousands of people across the Lower Danube in a short period was impossible, especially because the commoners were unwilling to &quot;move to foreign places, where they had nothing of their own and where the lands were already occupied.&quot; Historians who accept the continuity theory also argue that Roman sources do not mention that the Roman population was moved from Dacia Traiana, but that the military and administration were removed.

Most Romanian scholars accepting the continuity theory regard the archaeological evidence for the uninterrupted presence of a Romanized population in the lands now forming Romania undeniable. Especially, artefacts bearing Christian symbolism, hoards of bronze Roman coins and Roman-style pottery are listed among the archaeological finds verifying the theory. The same scholars emphasize that the Romanians directly inherited the basic Christian terminology from Latin, which also substantiates the connection between Christian objects and the Romanians&#x27; ancestors. Other scholars who support the same theory underline that the connection between certain artefacts or archaeological assemblages and ethnic groups is uncertain. Instead of archaeological evidence, Alexandru Madgearu highlights the importance of the linguistic traces of continuity, referring to the Romanian river names in the Apuseni Mountains and the preservation of archaic Latin lexical elements in the local dialect. The survival of the names of the largest rivers from Antiquity is often cited as an evidence for the continuity theory, although some linguists who support it note that a Slavic-speaking population transmitted them to modern Romanians. Some words directly inherited from Latin are also said to prove the continuous presence of the Romanians&#x27; ancestors north of the Danube, because they refer to things closely connected to these regions, as well as the preservation of Romanian words of Latin origin that the other Romance languages have lost. Linguists Grigore Nandriș and Marius Sala argue that the Latin words for natural oil, gold and bison could only be preserved in the lands to the north of the river.

Written sources did not mention the Romanians, either those who lived north of the Lower Danube or those living to the south of the river, for centuries. Scholars supporting the continuity theory note that the silence of sources does not contradict it, because early medieval authors named the foreign lands and their inhabitants after the ruling peoples. Hence, they mentioned Gothia, Hunia, Gepidia, Avaria, Patzinakia and Cumania, and wrote of Goths, Huns, Gepids, Avars, Pechenegs and Cumans, without revealing the multi-ethnic character of these realms. References to the &quot;Volokhi&quot; in the &quot;Russian Primary Chronicle&quot;, and to the &quot;Blakumen&quot; in Scandinavian sources are often listed as the first records of north-Danubian Romanians. The &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot;the oldest extant Hungarian &quot;gesta&quot;, or book of deeds, written around 1200, some 300 years after the described events mentions the Vlachs and the &quot;shepherd of the Romans&quot; (&quot;et Blachij, ac pastores romanorum&quot;) along with the Bulgarians, Slavs, Greeks, Khazars, Székelys, and other people among the inhabitants of the Carpathian Basin at the time of the arrival of the Hungarians in the late 9th century. Simon of Kéza&#x27;s later Hungarian chronicle described the Vlachs (&quot;Blackis&quot;) as &quot;shepherds and husbandmen of the Huns&quot; who remained in Pannonia. The historian Ioan-Aurel Pop concludes that the two chronicles &quot;assert the Roman origin of Romanians... by presenting them as the Romans&#x27; descendants&quot; who stayed in the former Roman provinces.

===Immigrationist theory===
Scholars who support the immigrationist theory propose that the Romanians descended from the Romanized inhabitants of the provinces to the south of the Danube. Following the collapse of the empire&#x27;s frontiers around 620, some of this population moved south to regions where Latin had not been widely spoken. During the Slavic invasion, many took refuge in the Balkan Mountains where they adopted an itinerant form of sheep- and goat-breeding, giving rise to the modern Vlach shepherds. They intermingled with Albanians. Their mobile lifestyle contributed to their spread in the mountainous zones. The start of their northward migration cannot exactly be dated, but they did not settle in the lands north to the Lower Danube before the end of the 10th century, and they crossed the Carpathians after the mid-12th century.

Immigrationist scholars emphasize that all other Romance languages developed in regions which had been under Roman rule for more than 500 years and nothing suggests that Romanian was an exception. Even in Britain, where the Roman rule lasted for 365 years (more than twice as long as in Dacia Traiana), the pre-Roman languages survived. Proponents of the theory have not developed a consensual view about the Dacians&#x27; fate after the Roman conquest, but they agree that the presence of a non-Romanized rural population (either the remnants of the local Dacians, or immigrant tribesmen) in Dacia Traiana is well-documented. The same scholars find it hard to believe that the Romanized elements preferred to stay behind when the Roman authorities announced the withdrawal of the troops from the province and offered the civilians the opportunity to follow them to the Balkans. Furthermore, the Romans had started fleeing from Dacia Traiana decades before it was abandoned.

Almost no place name has been preserved in the former province (while more than twenty settlements still bear a name of Roman origin in England). The present forms of the few river names inherited from antiquity show that non-Latin-speaking populationsDacians and Slavsmediated them to the modern inhabitants of the region. Both literary sources and archaeological finds confirm this conjecture: the presence of Carpians, Vandals, Taifals, Goths, Gepids, Huns, Slavs, Avars, Bulgarians and Hungarians in the former Roman province in the early Middle Ages is well documented. Sporadic references to few Latin-speaking individualsmerchants and prisoners of waramong the Huns and Gepids in the 5th century do not contradict this picture. Since Eastern Germanic peoples inhabited the lands to the north of the Lower Danube for more than 300 years, the lack of loanwords borrowed from them also indicates that the Romanians&#x27; homeland was located in other regions. Likewise, no early borrowings from Eastern or Western Slavic languages can be proven, although the Romanians&#x27; ancestors should have had much contact with Eastern and Western Slavs to the north of the Danube.

Immigrationist scholars underline that the population of the Roman provinces to the south of the Danube was &quot;thoroughly Latinized&quot;. Romanian has common features with idioms spoken in the Balkans (especially with Albanian and Bulgarian), suggesting that these languages developed side by side for centuries. South Slavic loanwords also abound in Romanian. Literary sources attest the presence of significant Romance-speaking groups in the Balkans (especially in the mountainous regions) in the Middle Ages. Dozens of place names of Romanian origin can still be detected in the same territory. The Romanians became Orthodox Christians and adopted Old Church Slavonic as liturgical language, which could hardly have happened in the lands to the north of the Danube after 864 (when Boris I of Bulgaria converted to Christianity). Early medieval documents unanimously describe the Vlachs as a mobile pastoralist population. Slavic and Hungarian loanwords also indicate that the Romanians&#x27; ancestors adopted a settled way of life only at a later phase of their ethnogenesis.

Reliable sources refer to the Romanians&#x27; presence in the lands to the north of the Danube for the first time in the 1160s. No place names of Romanian origin were recorded where early medieval settlements existed in this area. Here, the Romanians adopted Hungarian, Slavic and German toponyms, also indicating that they arrived after the Saxons settled in southern Transylvania in the mid-12th century. The Romanians initially formed scattered communities in the Southern Carpathians, but their northward expansion is well-documented from the second half of the 13th century. Both the monarchs and individual landowners (including Roman Catholic prelates) promoted their immigration because the Romanian sheep-herders strengthened the defense of the borderlands, and settled areas which could not be brought into agricultural cultivation. The Romanians adopted a sedentary way of life after they started settling on the edge of lowland villages in the mid-14th century. Their immigration continued during the following centuries and they gradually took possession of the settlements in the plains which had been depopulated by frequent incursions.

===Admigration theory===
According to the &quot;admigration&quot; theory, proposed by Dimitrie Onciul (1856–1923), the formation of the Romanian people occurred in the former &quot;Dacia Traiana&quot; province, and in the central regions of the Balkan Peninsula. However, the Balkan Vlachs&#x27; northward migration ensured that these centers remained in close contact for centuries. It is a compromise between the immigrationist and the continuity theories.

===On peoples north of the Lower Danube===

====Antiquity====

In the 5th century BC, Herodotus was the first author to write a detailed account of the natives of south-eastern Europe. In connection with a Persian campaign in 514 BC, he mentions the Getae, which he called &quot;the most courageous and upright Thracian tribe&quot;. The Getae were Thracian tribes living on either side of the Lower Danube, in what is today northern Bulgaria and southern Romania. Strabo (64/63 BCE-24 CE) wrote that the language of the Dacians was &quot;the same as that of the Getae&quot;.

Literary tradition on the conquest of Dacia was preserved by 3-4 Roman scholars. Cassius Dio wrote that &quot;numerous Dacians kept transferring their allegiance&quot; to Emperor Trajan before he commenced his war against Decebalus . Lucian of Samosata (c. 125 – after 180 CE), Eutropius (fl. around 360 CE), and Julian the Apostate (331/332–363 CE) unanimously attest the memory of a &quot;deliberate ethnic cleansing&quot; that followed the fall of the Dacian state. For instance, Lucian of Samosata who cites Emperor Trajan&#x27;s physician Criton of Heraclea states that the entire Dacian &quot;people was reduced to forty men&quot;. In fact, Thracian or possibly Dacian names represent about 2% of the approximately 3,000 proper names known from &quot;Dacia Traiana&quot;. Bitus, Dezibalos and other characteristic Dacian names were only recorded in the empire&#x27;s other territories, including Egypt and Italy. Constantin Daicoviciu, Dumitru Protase, Dan Ruscu and other historians have debated the validity of the tradition of the Dacians&#x27; extermination. They state that it only refers to the men&#x27;s fate or comes from Eutropius&#x27;s writings to provide an acceptable explanation for the massive colonisation that followed the conquest. Indeed, Eutropius also reported that Emperor Trajan transferred to the new province &quot;vast numbers of people from all over the Roman world&quot;. Onomastic evidence substantiates his words: about 2,000 Latin, 420 Greek, 120 Illyrian, and 70 Celtic names are known from the Roman period.

Barbarian attacks against &quot;Dacia Traiana&quot; were also recorded. For instance, &quot;an inroad of the Carpi&quot; forced Emperor Galerius&#x27;s mother to flee from the province in the 240s. Aurelius Victor, Eutropius and Festus stated that Dacia &quot;was lost&quot; under Emperor Gallienus (&quot;r.&quot; 253268). The &quot;Augustan History&quot; and Jordanes refer to the Roman withdrawal from the province in the early 270s. The &quot;Augustan History&quot; says that Emperor Aurelian &quot;led away both soldiers and provincials&quot; from Dacia in order to repopulate Illyricum and Moesia. Scholars supporting the immigrationist theory argue that for total assimilation at least 400 years of Roman rule would be needed, as in other provinces.

====Early Middle Ages====

In less than a century, the one-time province was named &quot;Gothia&quot;, by authors including the 4th-century Orosius. The existence of Christian communities in Gothia is attested by the &quot;Passion&quot; of Sabbas, &quot;a Goth by race&quot; and by the martyrologies of Wereka and Batwin, and other Gothic Christians. Large number of Goths, Taifali, and according to Zosimus &quot;other tribes that formerly dwelt among them&quot; were admitted into the Eastern Roman Empire following the invasion of the Huns in 376. In contrast with these peoples, the Carpo-Dacians &quot;were mixed with the Huns&quot;. Priscus of Panium, who visited the Hunnic Empire in 448, wrote that the empire&#x27;s inhabitants spoke either Hunnic or Gothic, and that those who had &quot;commercial dealings with the western Romans&quot; also spoke Latin. He also mentions the local name of two drinks, &quot;medos&quot; and &quot;kam&quot;. Emperor Diocletian&#x27;s &quot;Edict on Prices&quot; states that the Pannonians had a drink named &quot;kamos&quot;. &quot;Medos&quot; may have also been an Illyrian term, but a Germanic explanation cannot be excluded.
The 6th-century author Jordanes who called Dacia &quot;Gepidia&quot; was the first to write of the Antes and Slavenes. He wrote that the Slavenes occupied the region &quot;from the city of Noviodunum and the lake called Mursianus&quot; to the river Dniester, and that the Antes dwelled &quot;in the curve of the sea of Pontus&quot;. Procopius wrote that the Antes and the Slaveni spoke &quot;the same language, an utterly barbarous tongue&quot;. He also writes of an Antian who &quot;spoke in the Latin tongue&quot;. The late 7th-century author Ananias of Shirak wrote in his geography that the Slavs inhabited the &quot;large country of Dacia&quot; and formed 25 tribes. In 2001, Florin Curta argues, that the Slaveni ethnonym may have only been used &quot;as an umbrella term for various groups living north of the Danube frontier, which were neither &#x27;Antes&#x27;, nor &#x27;Huns&#x27; or &#x27;Avars&#x27;&quot;.

The Ravenna Geographer wrote about a Dacia &quot;populated by the [...] Avars&quot;, but written sources from the 9th and 10th centuries are scarce. The &quot;Royal Frankish Annals&quot; refers to the Abodrites living &quot;in Dacia on the Danube as neighbors of the Bulgars&quot; around 824. The &quot;Bavarian Geographer&quot; locates the &quot;Merehanii&quot; next to the Bulgars. By contrast, Alfred the Great wrote of &quot;Dacians, who were formerly Goths&quot;, living to the south-east of the &quot;Vistula country&quot; in his abridged translation (&quot;ca&quot;. 890) of Paulus Orosius&#x27; much earlier work &quot;Historiae Adversus Paganos&quot; written around 417. Emperor Constantine VII&#x27;s &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; contains the most detailed information on the history of the region in the first decades of the 10th century. It reveals that &quot;Patzinakia&quot;, the Pechenegs&#x27; land was bordered by Bulgaria on the Lower Danube around 950, and the Hungarians lived on the rivers Criș, Mureș, Timiș, Tisa and &quot;Toutis&quot; at the same time. That the Pechenegs&#x27; land was located next to Bulgaria is confirmed by the contemporary Abraham ben Jacob.

====First references to Romanians====

The &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; from around 1150 or 1200 is the first chronicle to write of Vlachs in the intra-Carpathian regions. Its anonymous author stated that the Hungarians encountered &quot;Slavs, Bulgarians, Vlachs, and the shepherds of the Romans&quot; when invading the Carpathian Basin around 895. He also wrote of Gelou, &quot;a certain Vlach&quot; ruling Transylvania, a land inhabited by &quot;Vlachs and Slavs&quot;. In his study on medieval Hungarian chronicles, Carlile Aylmer Macartney concluded that the &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; did not prove the presence of Romanians in the territory, since its author&#x27;s &quot;manner is much rather that of a romantic novelist than a historian&quot;. In contrast, Alexandru Madgearu, in his monography dedicated to the Gesta, stated that this chronicle &quot;is generally credible&quot;, since its narration can be &quot;confirmed by the archaeological evidence or by comparison with other written sources&quot; in many cases.

The late 12th-century chronicle of Niketas Choniates contains another early reference to Vlachs living north of the Danube. He wrote that they seized the future Byzantine emperor, Andronikos Komnenos when &quot;he reached the borders of Halych&quot; in 1164. Thereafter, information on Vlachs from the territory of present-day Romania abounds. Choniates mentioned that the Cumans crossed the Lower Danube &quot;with a division of Vlachs&quot; from the north to launch a plundering raid against Thrace in 1199. Pope Gregory IX wrote about &quot;a certain people in the Cumanian bishopric called &quot;Walati&quot;&quot; and their bishops around 1234. The oldest extant documents from Transylvania, dating from the 12th and 13th centuries, make passing references to both Hungarians and Vlachs. A royal charter of 1223 confirming a former grant of land is the earliest official document mentioning the presence of Romanians in Transylvania. It refers to the transfer of land previously held by them to the monastery of Cârța, which proves that this territory had been inhabited by Vlachs before the monastery was founded. According to the next document, the Teutonic Knights received the right to pass through the lands possessed by the Székelys and the Vlachs in 1223. Next year the Transylvanian Saxons were entitled to use certain forests together with the Vlachs and Pechenegs. In the 1280s, Simon of Kéza in the &quot;Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum&quot; wrote that the Székelys are the remnants of Huns, meet with the returning Hungarians to join their conquest, then they acquired part of the country, but in the mountains, which they shared with the Vlachs, mingling with them and allegedly adopting the Vlachs&#x27; alphabet. This passage is repeated with small changes in the Chronicon Pictum. Kézai confused the Székelys runs with the Cyrillic script which was used by the Vlachs and his erroneous opinion is based maybe on the observation that the Vlach shepherds in­cised mnemonic signs while counting their sheep.

A charter of 1247 of King Béla IV of Hungary lists small Romanian polities existing north of the Lower Danube. Thomas Tuscus mentioned Vlachs fighting against the Ruthenes in 1276 or 1277. References to Vlachs living in the lands of secular lords and prelates in the Kingdom of Hungary appeared in the 1270s. First the canons of the cathedral chapter in Alba Iulia received a royal authorization to settle Romanians to their domains in 1276. Thereafter, royal charters attest the presence of Romanians in more counties, for instance in Zaránd from 1318, in Bihar and in Máramaros from 1326, and in Torda from 1342. The first independent Romanian state, the Principality of Wallachia, was known as &quot;Oungrovlachia&quot; (&quot;Vlachia near Hungary&quot;) in Byzantine sources, while Moldavia received the Greek denominations &quot;Maurovlachia&quot; (&quot;Black Vlachia&quot;) or &quot;Russovlachia&quot; (&quot;Vlachia near Russia&quot;).

Historian Ioan-Aurel Pop writes that hundreds of 15th-century Hungarian documents prove that the Romanians were thought to have held lands in Transylvania and the neighboring regions already early in the 11th century or even around 450. For instance, he lists documents mentioning liberties that &quot;divi reges Hungariae&quot; granted to the Romanians, proposing that the Latin text does not refer to the &quot;deceased kings of Hungary&quot; in general (which is its traditional translation), but specifically to the two 11th-century &quot;holy kings of Hungary&quot;, Stephen I and Ladislaus I. Pop also refers to the testimony of a Romanian nobleman who stated in 1452 that his family had been in the possession of his estates for a thousand years in order to defend his property rights against another Romanian noble.

===On Balkan Vlachs===
The words &quot;torna, torna fratre&quot; recorded in connection with a Roman campaign across the Balkan Mountains by Theophylact Simocatta and Theophanes the Confessor evidence the development of a Romance language in the late 6th century. The words were shouted &quot;in native parlance&quot; by a local soldier in 587 or 588. When narrating the rebellion of Bulgar noble Kuber and his people against the Avars, the 7th-century &quot;Miracles of St. Demetrius&quot; mentions that a close supporter of his, Mauros spoke four languages, including &quot;our language&quot; (Greek) and &quot;that of the Romans&quot; (Latin). Kuber led a population of mixed originincluding the descendants of Roman provincials who had been captured in the Balkans in the early 7th centuryfrom the region of Sirmium to Thessaloniki around 681.

John Skylitzes&#x27;s chronicle contains one of the earliest records on the Balkan Vlachs. He mentions that &quot;some vagabond Vlachs&quot; killed David, one of the four Cometopuli brothers between Kastoria and Prespa in 976. After the Byzantine occupation of Bulgaria, Emperor Basil II set up the autocephalous Archbishopric of Ohrid with the right from 1020 to collect income &quot;from the Vlachs in the whole of &quot;theme&quot; of Bulgaria&quot;. The late 11th-century Kekaumenos relates that the Vlachs of the region of Larissa had &quot;the custom of having their herds and families stay in high mountains and other really cold places from the month of April to the month of September&quot;. A passing remark by Anna Comnena reveals that nomads of the Balkans were &quot;commonly called Vlachs&quot; around 1100. Occasionally, the Balkan Vlachs cooperated with the Cumans against the Byzantine Empire, for instance by showing them &quot;the way through the passes&quot; of the Stara Planina in the 1090s.

Most information on the 1185 uprising of the Bulgars and Vlachs and the subsequent establishment of the Second Bulgarian Empire is based on Niketas Choniates&#x27;s chronicle. He states that it was &quot;the rustling of their cattle&quot; which provoked the Vlachs to rebel against the imperial government. Besides him, Ansbert, and a number of other contemporary sources refer to the Vlach origin of the Asen brothers who initiated the revolt. The Vlachs&#x27; pre-eminent role in the Second Bulgarian Empire is demonstrated by &quot;Blacia&quot;, and other similar denominations under which the new state was mentioned in contemporary sources. The &quot;Annales Florolivienses&quot;, the first such source, mentions the route of Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa &quot;through Hungary, Russia, Cumania, &quot;Vlakhia&quot;, Durazzo, Byzantium and Turkey&quot; during his crusade of 1189. Pope Innocent III used the terms &quot;Vlachia and Bulgaria&quot; jointly when referring to the whole territory of the Second Bulgarian Empire. Similarly, the chronicler Geoffrey of Villehardouin refers to the Bulgarian ruler Kaloyan as &quot;Johanitsa, the king of Vlachia and Bulgaria&quot;. The Icelandic author Snorri Sturluson mentioned the Balkan Vlachs&#x27; territory as &quot;Blokumannaland&quot; in his early 13th-century text &quot;Heimskringla&quot;. William of Rubruck distinguished Bulgaria from &quot;Blakia&quot;. He stated that &quot;Bulgaria, &quot;Blakia&quot; and Slavonia were provinces of the Greeks&quot;, implying that his &quot;Blakia&quot; was also located south of the Danube. Likewise, the &quot;Vlach lands&quot; mentioned in the works of Abulfeda, Ibn Khaldun and other medieval Muslim authors are identical with Bulgaria.

===Uncertain references===

The 10th-century Muslim scholars, Al-Muqaddasi and Ibn al-Nadim mentioned the &quot;Waladj&quot; and the &quot;Blaghā&quot;, respectively in their lists of peoples. The lists also refer to the Khazars, Alans, and Greeks, and it is possible that the two ethnonyms refer to Vlachs dwelling somewhere in south-eastern Europe. For instance, historian Alexandru Madgearu says that Al-Muqaddasi&#x27;s work is the first reference to Romanians living north of the Danube. Victor Spinei writes that a runestone which was set up around 1050 contains the earliest reference to Romanians living east of the Carpathians. It refers to &quot;Blakumen&quot; who killed a Varangian merchant at an unspecified place. The 11th-century Persian writer, Gardizi, wrote about a Christian people &quot;from the Roman Empire&quot; called &quot;N.n.d.r&quot;, inhabiting the lands along the Danube. He describes them as &quot;more numerous than the Hungarians, but weaker&quot;. Historian Adolf Armbruster identified this people as Vlachs. In Hungarian, the Bulgarians were called &quot;Nándor&quot; in the Middle Ages.

The &quot;Russian Primary Chronicle&quot; from 1113 contains possible references to Vlachs in the Carpathian Basin. It relates how the &quot;Volokhi&quot; seized &quot;the territory of the Slavs&quot; and were expelled by the Hungarians. Therefore, the Slavs&#x27; presence antedates the arrival of the &quot;Volokhi&quot; in the chronicle&#x27;s narration. It places their country west to the Baltic sea.&#x27; Madgearu and many other historians argue that the &quot;Volokhi&quot; are Vlachs, but the &quot;Volokhi&quot; have also been identified with either Romans or Franks annexing Pannonia (for instance, by Lubor Niederle is a representative of the first approach, and Dennis Deletant and Vladimir Petrukhin associates the &quot;Volokhi&quot; with the Franks).&#x27;

The poem &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; from the early 1200s mentions one &quot;duke Ramunc of Wallachia&quot; in the retinue of Attila the Hun. The poem alludes to the Vlachs along with the Russians, Greeks, Poles and Pechenegs, and may refer to a &quot;Wallachia&quot; east of the Carpathians. The identification of the Vlachs and the &quot;Bolokhoveni&quot; of the &quot;Hypatian Chronicle&quot; whose land bordered on the Principality of Halych is not unanimously accepted by historians (for instance, Victor Spinei refuses it).

==Archaeological data==
===North of the Lower Danube===
&quot;Tumuli&quot; erected for a cremation rite appeared in Oltenia and in Transylvania around 100 BC, thus preceding the emergence of the Dacian kingdom. Their rich inventory has analogies in archaeological sites south of the Danube. Although only around 300 graves from the next three centuries have been unearthed in Romania, they represent multiple burial rites, including &quot;ustrinum&quot; cremation and inhumation. New villages in the Mureș valley prove a demographic growth in the 1st century BC. Fortified settlements were erected on hilltops, mainly in the Orăștie Mountains, but open villages remained the most common type of settlement. In contrast with the finds of 25,000 Roman &quot;denarii&quot; and their local copies, imported products were virtually missing in Dacia. The interpretations of Geto-Dacian archaeological findings are problematic because they may be still influenced by methodological nationalism.

The conquering Romans destroyed all fortresses and the main Dacian sanctuaries around 106 AD. All villages disappeared because of the demolition. Roman settlements built on the location of former Dacian ones have not been identified yet. However, the rural communities at Boarta, Cernat, and other places used &quot;both traditional and Roman items&quot;, even thereafter. Objects representing local traditions have been unearthed at Roman villas in Aiudul de Sus, Deva and other places as well. A feature of the few types of native pottery which continued to be produced in Roman times is the &quot;Dacian cup&quot;, a mostly hand-made mug with a wide rim, which was used even in military centers. The use of a type of tall cooking pot indicates the survival of traditional culinary practices as well.

Colonization and the presence of military units gave rise to the emergence of most towns in &quot;Dacia Traiana&quot;: for instance, Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa was founded for veterans, Apulum and Potaissa started to develop as &quot;canabae&quot;. Towns were the only places where the presence of Christians can be assumed based on objects bearing Christian symbolism, including a lamp and a cup decorated with crosses, which have been dated to the Roman period. Rural cemeteries characterized by burial rites with analogies in sites east of the Carpathians attest to the presence of immigrant &quot;barbarian&quot; communities, for instance, at Obreja and Soporu de Câmpie. Along the northwestern frontiers of the province, &quot;Przeworsk&quot; settlements were unearthed at Boinești, Cehăluț, and other places.

Archaeological finds suggest that attacks against Roman Dacia became more intensive from the middle of the 3rd century: an inscription from Apulum hails Emperor Decius (&quot;r.&quot; 249–251) as the &quot;restorer of Dacia&quot;; and coin hoards ending with pieces minted in this period have been found. Inscriptions from the 260s attest that the two Roman legions of Dacia were transferred to Pannonia Superior and Italy. Coins bearing the inscription &quot;DACIA FELIX&quot; minted in 271 may reflect that Trajan&#x27;s Dacia still existed in that year, but they may as well refer to the establishment of the new province of &quot;Dacia Aureliana&quot;.

The differentiation of archaeological finds from the periods before and after the Roman withdrawal is not simple, but Archiud, Obreja, and other villages produced finds from both periods. In general, objects dating after the withdrawal are much more primitive, however, some elements of provincial Roman culture survived, particularly in pottery, but also in other areas of production, such as the one regarding the typical provincial Roman brooches. Towns have also yielded evidence on locals staying behind. For instance, in Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegatusa, at least one building was inhabited even in the 4th century, and a local factory continued to produce pottery, although &quot;in a more restricted range&quot;. Roman coins from the 3rd and 4th centuries, mainly minted in bronze, were found in Banat where small Roman forts were erected in the 290s. Coins minted under Emperor Valentinian I (&quot;r.&quot; 364–375) were also found in Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa, where the gate of the amphitheater was walled at an uncertain date. A votive plate found near a spring at Biertan bears a Latin inscription dated to the 4th century, and has analogies in objects made in the Roman Empire. Whether this &quot;donarium&quot; belonged to a Christian missionary, to a local cleric or layman or to a pagan Goth making an offering at the spring is still debated by archaeologists.

A new cultural synthesis, the &quot;Sântana de Mureș-Chernyakhov culture&quot;, spread through the plains of Moldavia and Wallachia in the early 4th century. It incorporated elements of the &quot;Wielbark culture&quot; of present-day Poland and of local tradition. More than 150 &quot;Sântana de Mureș-Chernyakhov&quot; settlements suggest that the territory experienced a demographic growth. Three sites in the Eastern Carpathians already inhabited in the previous century prove the natives&#x27; survival as well. Growing popularity of inhumation burials also characterizes the period. &quot;Sântana de Mureș-Chernyakhov&quot; cemeteries from the 4th century were also unearthed in Transylvania.
Coin hoards ending with pieces from the period between 375 and 395 unearthed at Bistreț, Gherla, and other settlements point to a period of uncertainty. Featuring elements of the &quot;Przeworsk&quot; and &quot;Sântana de Mureș-Chernyakhov&quot; cultures also disappeared around 400. Archaeological sites from the next centuries have yielded finds indicating the existence of scattered communities bearing different traditions. Again, cremation became the most widespread burial rite east of the Carpathians, where a new type of buildingsunken huts with an oven in the corneralso appeared. The heterogeneous vessel styles were replaced by the more uniform &quot;Suceava-Șipot&quot; archaeological horizon of hand made pottery from the 550s.

In contrast with the regions east of the Carpathians, Transylvania experienced the spread of the &quot;row grave&quot; horizon of inhumation necropolises in the 5th century, also known from the same period in Austria, Bohemia, Transdanubia and Thuringia. At the same time, large villages appeared in Crișana and Transylvania, in most cases in places where no earlier habitation has yet been proven. Moreover, imported objects with Christian symbols, including a fish-shaped lamp from Lipova, and a &quot;Saint Menas flask&quot; from Moigrad, were unearthed. However, only about 15% of the 30 known &quot;row grave&quot; cemeteries survived until the late 7th century. They together form the distinct &quot;Band-Noșlac&quot; group of graveyards which also produced weapons and other objects of Western or Byzantine provenance.

The earliest examples in Transylvania of inhumation graves with a corpse buried, in accordance with nomadic tradition, with remains of a horse were found at Band. The &quot;Gâmbaș group&quot; of cemeteries emerged in the same period, producing weapons similar to those found in the Pontic steppes. Sunken huts appeared in the easternmost zones of Transylvania around the 7th century. Soon the new horizon of &quot;Mediaș&quot; cemeteries, containing primarily cremation graves, spread along the rivers of the region. The &quot;Nușfalău-Someșeni&quot; cemeteries likewise follow the cremation rite, but they produced large &quot;tumuli&quot; with analogies in the territories east of the Carpathians.

In the meantime, the &quot;Suceava-Șipot horizon&quot; disappeared in Moldavia and Wallachia, and the new &quot;Dridu culture&quot; emerged on both sides of the Lower Danube around 700. Thereafter the region again experienced demographic growth. For instance, the number of settlements unearthed in Moldavia grew from about 120 to about 250 from the 9th century to the 11th century. Few graveyards yielding artifacts similar to &quot;Dridu cemeteries&quot; were also founded around Alba Iulia in Transylvania. The nearby &quot;Ciumbrud group&quot; of necropolises of inhumation graves point at the presence of warriors. However, no early medieval fortresses unearthed in Transylvania, including Cluj-Mănăștur, Dăbâca, and Șirioara, can be definitively dated earlier than the 10th century.

Small inhumation cemeteries of the &quot;Cluj group&quot;, characterized by &quot;partial symbolic horse burials&quot;, appeared at several places in Banat, Crișana, and Transylvania including at Biharia, Cluj and Timișoara around 900. Cauldrons and further featuring items of the &quot;Saltovo-Mayaki culture&quot; of the Pontic steppes were unearthed in Alba Iulia, Cenad, Dăbâca, and other settlements. A new custom of placing coins on the eyes of the dead was also introduced around 1000. &quot;Bijelo Brdo&quot; cemeteries, a group of large graveyards with close analogies in the whole Carpathian Basin, were unearthed at Deva, Hunedoara and other places. The east–west orientation of their graves may reflect Christian influence, but the following &quot;Citfalău group&quot; of huge cemeteries that appeared in royal fortresses around 1100 clearly belong to a Christian population.

Romanian archaeologists propose that a series of archaeological horizons that succeeded each other in the lands north of the Lower Danube in the early Middle Ages support the continuity theory. In their view, archaeological finds at Brateiu (in Transylvania), Ipotești (in Wallachia) and Costișa (in Moldavia), part of the Ipotești-Ciurel-Cândești Culture, represent the Daco-Roman stage of the Romanians&#x27; ethnogenesis which ended in the 6th century. The next (&quot;Romanic&quot;) stage can be detected through assemblages unearthed in Ipotești, Botoșana, Hansca and other places which were dated to the 7th-8th centuries. Finally, the Dridu culture is said to be the evidence for the &quot;ancient Romanian&quot; stage of the formation of the Romanian people. In contrast to these views, Opreanu emphasizes that the principal argument of the hypothesisthe presence of artefacts imported from the Roman Empire and their local copies in allegedly &quot;Daco-Roman&quot; or &quot;Romanic&quot; assemblagesis not convincing, because close contacts between the empire and the neighboring Slavs and Avars is well-documented. He also underlines that Dridu culture developed after a &quot;cultural discontinuity&quot; that followed the disappearance of the previous horizons. Regarding both the Slavs and Romanians as sedentary populations, Alexandru Madgearu also underlines that the distinction of &quot;Slavic&quot; and &quot;Romanian&quot; artefacts is difficult, because archaeologists can only state that these artifacts could hardly be used by nomads. He proposes that &quot;The wheel-made pottery produced on the fast wheel (as opposed to the tournette), which was found in several settlements of the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries, may indicate the continuation of Roman traditions&quot; in Transylvania.

Thomas Nägler proposes that a separate &quot;Ciugud culture&quot; represents the Vlach population of southern Transylvania. He also argues that two treasures from Cârțișoara and Făgăraș also point at the presence of Vlachs. Both hoards contain Byzantine coins ending with pieces minted under Emperor John II Komnenos who died in 1143. Tudor Sălăgean proposes that these treasures point at a local elite with &quot;at least&quot; economic contacts with the Byzantine Empire. Paul Stephenson argues that Byzantine coins and jewellery from this period, unearthed at many places in Hungary and Romania, are connected to salt trade.

According to Florin Curta, no indication of a migration in the 10th century from the south to the north of the Danube have been found. Many sites excavated from the 10th century in the region of Romania show signs of being built in the previous 100 or 200 years, while in those that were started in the 10th century the ceramic is no different than what was previously used in the region, and most of the animal bones discovered were from horned cattle and pigs, not sheep or goats which are usually associated with transhumant herding.

===Central and Northern Balkans===
Fortified settlements built on hill-tops characterized the landscape in Illyricum before the Roman conquest. In addition, pile dwellings formed villages along the rivers Sava and its tributaries. Roman coins unearthed in the northwestern regions may indicate that trading contacts between the Roman Empire and Illyricum began in the 2nd century BC, but piracy, quite widespread in this period, could also contribute to their cumulation. The first Roman road in the Balkans, the Via Egnatia which linked Thessaloniki with Dyrrhachium was built in 140 BC. Byllis and Dyrrhachium, the earliest Roman colonies were founded a century later. The Romans established a number of colonies for veterans and other towns, including Emona, Siscia, Sirmium and Iovia Botivo, in the next four centuries.

Hand-made pottery of local tradition remained popular even after potter&#x27;s wheel was introduced by the Romans. Likewise, as is demonstrated by altars dedicated to Illyrian deities at Bihać and Topusko, native cults survived the Roman conquest. Latin inscriptions on stone monuments prove the existence of a native aristocracy in Roman times. Native settlements flourished in the mining districts in Upper Moesia up until the 4th century. Native names and local burial rites only disappeared in these territories in the 3rd century. In contrast, the frontier region along the Lower Danube in Moesia had already in the 1st century AD transformed into &quot;a secure Roman-only zone&quot; (Brad Bartel), from where the natives were moved.

Emperors born in Illyricum, a common phenomenon of the period, erected a number of imperial residences at their birthplaces. For instance, a palace was built for Maximianus Herculius near Sirmium, and another for Constantine the Great in Mediana. New buildings, rich burials and late Roman inscriptions show that Horreum Margi, Remesiana, Siscia, Viminacium, and other centers of administration also prospered under these emperors. Archaeological researchincluding the large cemeteries unearthed at Ulpianum and Naissusshows that Christian communities flourished in Pannonia and Moesia from the 4th century. Inscriptions from the 5th century point at Christian communities surviving the destruction brought by the Huns at Naissus, Viminacium and other towns of Upper Moesia. In contrast, &quot;villae rusticae&quot; which had been centers of agriculture from the 1st century disappeared around 450. Likewise, forums, well planned streets and other traditional elements of urban architecture ceased to exist. For instance, Sirmium &quot;disintegrated into small hamlets emerging in urban areas that had not been in use until then&quot; after 450. New fortified centers developed around newly erected Christian churches in Sirmium, Novae, and many other towns by around 500. In contrast with towns, there are only two archaeological sites from this period identified as rural settlements.

Under Justinian the walls of Serdica, Ulpianum and many other towns were repaired. He also had hundreds of small forts erected along the Lower Danube, at mountain passes across the Balkan Mountains and around Constantinople. Inside these forts small churches and houses were built. Pollen analysis suggest that the locals cultivated legumes within the walls, but no other trace of agriculture have been identified. They were supplied with grain, wine and oil from distant territories, as it is demonstrated by the great number of amphorae unearthed in these sites which were used to transport these items to the forts. Most Roman towns and forts in the northern parts of the Balkans were destroyed in the 570s or 580s. Although some of them were soon restored, all of them were abandoned, many even &quot;without any signs of violence&quot;, in the early 7th century.

The new horizon of &quot;Komani-Kruja&quot; cemeteries emerged in the same century. They yielded grave goods with analogies in many other regions, including belt buckles widespread in the whole Mediterranean Basin, rings with Greek inscriptions, pectoral crosses, and weapons similar to &quot;Late Avar&quot; items. Most of them are situated in the region of Dyrrhachium, but such cemeteries were also unearthed at Viničani and other settlements along the Via Egnatia. &quot;Komani-Kruja&quot; cemeteries ceased to exist in the early 9th century. John Wilkes proposes that they &quot;most likely&quot; represent a Romanized population, while Florin Curta emphasizes their Avar features. Archaeological finds connected to a Romance-speaking population have also been searched in the lowlands to the south of the Lower Danube. For instance, Uwe Fiedler mentions that inhumation graves yielding no grave goods from the period between the 680s and the 860s may represent them, although he himself rejects this theory.

Historian Florin Curta, supporting his view on studies made by Bulgarian archaeologist Rasho Rashev, points that the region of Bregalnica river, where Schramm theorised the ethnogenesis of Romanians to start, did not show any signs of post-Roman habitations until around 800 CE when early Bulgarian culture took hold. Moreover, from an archaeological point of view, there is a clear increase in population in the wider region of nowadays Republic of North Macedonia after 900 CE with no signs of emigration.

==Linguistic approach==
===Development of Romanian===

The formation of Proto-Romanian (or Common Romanian) from Vulgar Latin started in the 5th-7th centuries and was completed in the 8th century. The common language split into variants during the 10th-12th centuries. The Romanian dialects spoken to the north of the Danube display a &quot;remarkable unity&quot;. Primarily the use of different words differentiate them, because their phonology is quite uniform. Linguist Gabriela Pană Dindelegan (who accepts the continuity theory) asserts that the Romanian shepherds&#x27; seasonal movements, and commercial contacts across the mountains secured the preservation of language unity. From another point of view, Paul Wexler proposes that the &quot;relative recency of the Romance-speaking settlement&quot; is a more plausible explanation, because the levelling effect of migrations is well-documented (for instance, in eastern Germany, and along the western coasts of the USA). Some Eastern Romance variants retained more elements of their Latin heritage than others. Primarily, the dialects of the peripheral areas (like Maramureș and Moldavia) preserved archaic linguistic features. For instance, the Maramureș subdialect of Romanian still uses both the ancient &quot;-a&quot; ending of verbs, and the Latin word for sand (&quot;arină&quot;) instead of standard &quot;nisip&quot; (a Slavic loanword), and Aromanian kept dozens of wordsincluding &quot;arină&quot;, &quot;oarfăn&quot; (&quot;orphan&quot;) and &quot;mes&quot; (&quot;month&quot;)lost in other variants. Emphasizing that western Transylvania used to be an integral part of Dacia Traiana, Nandriș concludes that &quot;Transylvania was the centre of linguistic expansion&quot;, because the Transylvanian dialects preserved Latin words which were replaced by loanwords in other variants; furthermore, place names with the archaic &quot;-ești&quot; ending abound in the region.
There are about 90 words of substrate origin. The largest semantic field (46 out the 89 considered certain to be of substratum) is formed by words describing nature: terrain, flora and fauna, and about 30% of these words with Albanian cognate describing pastoral life The substrate language has been identified as &#x27;Thraco-Dacian&#x27;, &#x27;Thracian&#x27;, or &#x27;Daco-Moesian&#x27;, but the origin of these wordsAlbanian, Thraco-Dacian or an unidentified third languageis actually uncertain. When analyzing the historical circumstances of the adoption of these words, linguist Kim Schulte asserts that initially the &quot;political and cultural dominance of the Romans&quot; defined the relationship between the Latin-speaking groups and speakers of the substrate language, but the two communities continued to live side by side, communicating &quot;on regular basis about everyday matters regarding their pastoral activity and the natural environment&quot; even after the end of Roman rule.

About 70-90 possible substrate words have Albanian cognates, and 29 terms are probably loanwords from Albanian. Similarities between Romanian and Albanian are not limited to their common Balkan features and the assumed substrate words: the two languages share calques and proverbs, and display analogous phonetic changes. Some linguists suppose that the substratum of Eastern Romance was an Indo-European language closely related to Albanian, or perhaps even the direct ancestor of Albanian. Romanian linguist Marius Sala, who supports the continuity theory, argues that &#x27;Thraco-Dacian&#x27; was &quot;a variant of Thracian from which Albanian originated&quot;. However, in current historical linguistics the documented Thracian material clearly points to a different language than Albanian or its reconstructed precursor. Bulgarian linguist Vladimir I. Georgiev, who introduced the &#x27;Daco-Mysian&#x27; linguistic hypothesis, different from Thracian, proposed that both Albanian and Romanian developed in the &quot;Daco-Mysian region&quot; (encompassing Dacia to the north of the Lower Danube, and Moesia to the south of the river). He describes Romanian as a &quot;completely Romanized Daco-Mysian&quot;, and Albanian as a &quot;semi-Romanized Daco-Mysian&quot; that was spoken in Dardania probably since the 2nd millennium BCE or not later than circa 500 BCE. Georgiev&#x27;s claim that Albanian is a direct descendant of &#x27;Daco-Mysian&#x27; is highly based on speculations that have been thoroughly dismantled by other scholars. On the other hand, proponents of the immigrationist theory of Romanian regard these similarities as an important evidence for the Romanians&#x27; south-Danubian homeland. In particular, Schramm proposes that the Romanians&#x27; ancestors were Roman refugees who settled near the native pastoralist population of the mountains in the central Balkans in the 5th-6th centuries; they could only take possession of the highest mountain pastures where they lived surrounded by the semi-sedentary Proto-Albanians for centuries.

Every Romance language inherited only about 2,000 words directly from Latin. Around one-fifth of the entries of the 1958 edition of the &quot;Dictionary of the Modern Romanian&quot; have directly been inherited from Latin. The core vocabulary is to a large degree Latin, including the most frequently used 2500 words. More than 75% of the words in the semantic fields of sense perception, quantity, kinship and spatial relations are of Latin origin, but the basic lexicons of religion and of agriculture have also been preserved. More than 200 Latin words that other Romance languages preserved are missing in Romanian, but about 100 Latin terms were inherited only by Romanian. The preservation of the latter termsincluding &quot;creștin&quot; (&quot;Christian&quot;) and &quot;împărat&quot; (&quot;emperor&quot;)was due to their frequent use, according to Sala. Proponents of the continuity theory are convinced that the preservation or lack of certain Latin terms reveal that Romanian developed north of Lower Danube. One of these terms is the Latin word for gold &quot;(aurum)&quot;, preserved in Daco-Romanian, but lost in Aromanian and Istro-Romanian. For Nandriș, the word is important evidence for the Romanians&#x27; continuous presence in Transylvania, because Romanian mountaineers owned many Transylvanian gold mines in Modern Times, and Nandriș thinks that newcomers would not have been allowed to open mines in the province.

The Latin terms for fig tree &quot;(ficus)&quot; and chestnut &quot;(castaneus)&quot; were kept in Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian, but they disappeared from Daco-Romanian. Nandriș and Sala say that this fact is also a clear testimony for the Daco-Romanians&#x27; north-Danubian homeland, because these plants did not grow there. Nandriș asserts that the semantic evolution of certain inherited Latin words also supports the continuity theory. For instance, he refers to the development of Latin &quot;terminus&quot; (&quot;border, boundary, frontier&quot;) into Daco-Romanian &quot;țărm&quot; (&quot;embankment, sea-shore, river bank&quot;), proposing that this must have occurred north of the Lower Danube after the Roman withdrawal which made the river the empire&#x27;s northern frontier. He also mentions a Latin inscription in Dacia Traiana which contains the Latin word for moon &quot;(luna)&quot; with the meaning for month, because Daco-Romanian displays a similar semantic development. Other scholars attribute the same change to Slavic influence.

Romanian reflects most changes of Latin which occurred in the 2nd-6th centuries. In Gábor Vékony&#x27;s view, only uninterrupted contacts between the ancestors of Romanians, Dalmatians, Italians and other Romance peoples within the Roman Empire could secure the adoption of these changes, which excludes the north-Danubian territories, abandoned by the Romans in the late 3rd century. Vékony and Schramm also emphasize that the meaning of almost a dozen of inherited Latin terms changed in parallel in Romanian and Albanian, suggesting that contacts between the speakers of Proto-Romanian and Proto-Albanian were frequent. For instance, the Latin word for dragon &quot;(draco)&quot; developed into Daco-Romanian &quot;drac&quot; and Albanian &quot;dreq&quot;, both meaning devil; Daco-Romanian &quot;bătrîn&quot; and Albanian &quot;vjetër&quot; (both meaning old) descend from the Latin term for veteran &quot;(veteranus)&quot;. Furthermore, Romanian &quot;sat&quot; (&quot;village&quot;) was not directly inherited from Latin, but borrowed from Albanian &quot;fshat&quot; (&quot;village&quot;), the direct continuation of Latin &quot;fossatum&quot; (&quot;military camp&quot;). However, Nicolae Saramandu states that the similarities between Romanian and Albanian do not presuppose a limited space for coexistence, in the past, of the speakers of the two languages; the similarities in question are satisfactorily explained by a common heritage, in a large Romanized space in the north and south of the Danube, &quot;from the Carpathians to the Pindus&quot;.

In addition to words of Latin or of possible substratum origin, loanwords make up more than 40% (according to certain estimations 60-80%) of the Romanian vocabulary. Schulte notes that even &quot;relatively basic words denoting continually present meanings, such as features of the natural environment, are frequently borrowed&quot;. The names for most species of fish of the Danube and of dozens of other animals living in Romania are of Slavic origin. Dindelegan says that contacts with other peoples has not modified the &quot;Latin structure of Romanian&quot; and the &quot;non-Latin grammatical elements&quot; borrowed from other languages were &quot;adapted to and assimilated by the Romance pattern&quot;. Nandriș also says that linguistic influences &quot;are due to cultural intercourse&quot; and do not reveal closer contacts.

No loanwords of East Germanic origin have so far been proven. Scholars who accept the immigrationist theory emphasize that the lack of East Germanic loanwords excludes that the Romanians&#x27; homeland was located north of the Lower Danube, because Germanic tribes dominated these lands from the 270s to the 560s. Accepting this as a decisive argument, Bogdan P. Hasdeu placed it in Oltenia, as he falsely believed the Germanic tribes didn&#x27;t occupy that region. Stelian Brezeanu argues that the absence of East Germanic loanwords is &quot;basically the consequence of the gap&quot; between the Orthodox Romanians and the Arian Germans. He adds that the Daco-Romans assimilated the last Eastern Germanic groups in Transylvania before the middle of the 7th century. Linguist Sala mentions that the Germanic peoples stayed in the former Dacia Traiana province &quot;for a relatively brief span of time, only a couple of centuries&quot;, without maintaining close contacts with the Daco-Romans. Nandriș says that those who propose a south-Danubian homeland &quot;on the ground of the lack of Germanic elements&quot; in Romanian &quot;have the same argument against them&quot;, because Germanic tribes also settled in the Balkans in the early Middle Ages. In contrast, Schramm proposes that both Proto-Romanian and Proto-Albanian must have developed in the central Balkan regions where no Germanic tribes settled, because direct borrowings from East Germanic are also missing in Albanian.

Slavic loanwords make up about one-fifth of Romanian vocabulary. According to certain estimations, terms of Slavic origin are more numerous than the directly inherited Latin roots, although the Slavic loanwords often replaced or doubled the Latin terms. All Eastern Romance variants contain the same 80 Slavic loanwords, indicating that they were borrowed during the Common Romanian period. The vast majority of Slavic loanwords display phonetic changes occurring after around 800. To explain the lack of early borrowings, Brezeanu supposes that the Christian Proto-Romanians and the pagan Proto-Slavs did not mix. Schulte proposes that the Proto-Romanians and Proto-Slavs lived in close proximity under Avar rule, but neither group could achieve cultural dominance, because the Avars formed the elite. In contrast, Schramm argues that the only explanation for the lack of early Slavic borrowings is that the Proto-Albanians separated the Proto-Romanians (who lived in the mountains in the central Balkans) from the agriculturalist Proto-Slavs (who inhabited the lowlands) for centuries. 
The most intensive phase of borrowings form Slavic (specifically from South Slavic) tongues started around 900. The proportion of Slavic loanwords is especially high (20-25%) in the Romanians&#x27; religious, social and political vocabulary, but almost one-fifth of the Romanian terms related to emotions, values, speech and languages were also borrowed from Slavs. Slavic loanwords tend to have positive connotations in &quot;antonym pairs with one element borrowed from Slavic&quot;. Romanians also adopted dozens of Latin words through Slavic mediation. Wexler proposes that Slavic patterns gave rise to the development of significant part of about 900 Romanian words that are deemed to descend from hypothetical Latin words (that is words reconstructed on the basis of their Romanian form). Linguists often attribute the development of about 10 phonological and morphological features of Romanian to Slavic influence, but there is no consensual view. For instance, contacts with Slavic-speakers allegedly contributed to the appearance of the semi-vowel [y] before the vowel [e] at the beginning of basic words and to the development of the vocative case in Romanian.

Linguist Kim Schulte says, the significant common lexical items and the same morpho-syntactic structures of the Romanian and Bulgarian (and Macedonian) languages &quot;indicates that there was a high decree of bilingualism&quot; in this phase of the development of Romanian. Brezeanu argues that contacts between the Romanians&#x27; ancestors and the Slavs became intense due to the arrival of Bulgarian clerics to the lands north of the Lower Danube after the conversion of Bulgaria to Christianity. Thereafter, Brezeanu continues, Slavs formed the social and political elite for a lengthy period, as demonstrated both by loanwords (such as &quot;voivode&quot; and &quot;cneaz&quot;, both referring to the leaders of the Vlach communities) and by the semantic development of the term &quot;rumân&quot; (which referred to Wallachian serfs in the Middle Ages). Schramm argues that the Proto-Romanians&#x27; spread in the mountains in search for new pastures and the Slavicization of the Balkans suggest that close contacts developed between the Proto-Romanians and the Bulgarians in the 10th century.

Borrowings from Slavic languages show that there were &quot;localized contacts&quot; between Romanian and Slavic groups even after the disintegration of Common Romanian. The Daco-Romanian subdialects of Maramureș and Moldavia contains loanwords from Ukrainian, Polish and Russian. The Romanian form of loanwords from Ukrainian evidences that they were borrowed after the characteristic Ukrainian sound change from &quot;h&quot; to &quot;g&quot; was completed in the 12th century. Serbian influenced the subdialects spoken in Banat and Crișana from the 15th century. Bulgarian influenced the Wallachian subdialects even after Bulgarian ceased to influence other variants.

About 1.7% of Romanian words are of Greek origin. The earliest layer of Greek loanwords was inherited from the variant of Vulgar Latin from which Romanian descends. Schulte proposes that Byzantine Greek terms were adopted through close contacts between Romanian, South Slavic and Greek communities until the 10th century. However, H. Mihailescu proposed that all Byzantine Greek terms in Romanian are indirect loanwords from old Slavonic or Medieval Bulgarian not from a direct contact. Hungarian loanwords represent about 1.6% of Romanian vocabulary. According to Schulte, the Hungarian loanwords show that contacts between Romanians and Hungarians were limited to occasional encounters. On the other hand, Sala says that bilingualism must have existed. Loanwords from Pecheneg or Cuman are rare, but many Romanian leaders bore Cuman names, implying that they were of Cuman origin.

All neighboring peoples adopted a number of Romanian words connected to goat- and sheep-breeding. Romanian loanwords are rare in standard Hungarian, but abound in its Transylvanian dialects. In addition to place names and elements of the Romanian pastoral vocabulary, the Transylvanian Hungarians primarily adopted dozens of Romanian ecclesiastic and political terms to refer to specific Romanian institutions already before the mid-17th centuries (for instance, &quot;bojér&quot;, &quot;logofét&quot;, &quot;kalugyér&quot; and &quot;beszerika&quot;). The adoption of the Romanian terminology shows that the traditional Romanian institutions, which followed Byzantine patterns, significantly differed from their Hungarian counterparts.

Linguistic research plays a preeminent role in the construction of the way of life of the Romanians&#x27; ancestors, because &quot;historical sources are almost silent&quot;. The Romanians preserved the basic Latin agricultural vocabulary, but adopted a significant number of Slavic technical terms for agricultural tools and techniques. Inherited terminology for motion is strikingly numerous, showing the preeminent role of transhumant pastoralism in medieval Romanians&#x27; economy. In his study dedicated to the formation of the Romanian language, Nandriș concludes that the Latin population was &quot;reduced to a pastoral life in the mountains and to agricultural pursuits in the foothills of their pastural lands&quot; in the whole &quot;Carpatho-Balkan area&quot; (both to the north and to the south of the Lower Danube) after the collapse of the Roman rule. For historian Victor Spinei, the Slavic loanwords evince that the Romanians had already &quot;practiced an advanced level of agriculture&quot; before they entered into close contacts with the Slavs: otherwise they would not have needed the specialized terminology. Sala says that the Slavic terms &quot;penetrated Romanian&quot; because they designed the Slavs&#x27; more advanced tools which replaced the Romanians&#x27; ancestors obsolete tools.

Schramm concludes that the Proto-Romanians were pastoralists with superficial knowledge of agriculture, limited to the basic vocabulary and retained only because they regularly wintered their flocks on their sedentary neighbors&#x27; lands in the foothills. According to him, the adoption of Slavic (and later Hungarian) agricultural terminology clearly shows that the Romanians started to practice agriculture only at a later stage of their ethnogenesis. Other scholars, including historian Victor Spinei, state that the great number of names of crops and agricultural techniques directly inherited from Latin indicates &quot;a very long continuity of agricultural practices&quot;. Grigore Brâncuș adds to this list that the majority of pomiculture, numerous apicultural, and all the swineherding terms complete a view of a mixed farming society involved in both the growing of crops and the raising of livestock.

===Place names===
In an article dedicated to the development of the Romanian language, Nandriș states that the study of place names &quot;does not solve the problem of the cradle of primitive&quot; Romanian. In contrast to this view, Schramm says that the toponyms are crucial for the determination of the Romanians&#x27; homeland, because &quot;the whole of Romania is threaded with toponyms which conclusively &quot;exclude&quot; any form of continuity there&quot;. Place names provide a significant proportion of modern knowledge of the extinct languages of Southeastern Europe. The names of the longest rivers in Romania those longer than 500 kilometersare thought to be of Dacian origin. About twenty of their tributaries had names with probable Indo-European roots, also suggesting a Dacian etymology. The Romans adopted the native names of the longest rivers after they conquered Dacia.

Linguists Oliviu and Nicolae Felecan say that the &quot;preservation of river names from Antiquity until today is one of the most solid arguments&quot; in favor of the continuity theory, because these names must have been &quot;uninterruptedly transmitted&quot; from the Dacians to the Romans, and then to the Daco-Romans. Sala also states that the Romanian forms of some ancient river names &quot;are a conclusive argument&quot; for the continuity theory. The three scholars specifically refer to the Romanian name of the Danube, Dunărea, proposing that it developed from a supposed native (Thraco-Dacian or Daco-Moesian) &quot;*Donaris&quot; form. They also emphasize that the names of six other rivers display phonetic changesthe development of the consonant &quot;ʃ&quot; from &quot;s&quot;, and the vowel shift from &quot;a&quot; to &quot;o&quot;featuring the 2nd- and 3rd-century form of the native language. In contrast to these views, Nandriș (although he also accepts the continuity theory) states that alone among the rivers in Dacia, the development of the name of the Criș from ancient &quot;Crisius&quot; would be in line with the phonetical evolution of Romanian.

Scholars who reject the continuity theory emphasize that the Romanian names of the large rivers show that the Romanians did not directly inherit them from their Latin-speaking ancestors. According to Vékony (who promotes the immigrationist theory), the Romanian name of the Danube demonstrates that the Romanians&#x27; ancestors lived far from it, because otherwise they should have preserved its Latin name, &quot;Danuvius&quot;. He also emphasizes that the hypothetical &quot;*Donaris&quot; form is not attested in written sources and &quot;Istros&quot; was the river&#x27;s native name. According to Schramm, the early Slavs adopted the East Germanic name of the Danube, showing that a predominantly Gothic-speaking population inhabited the territory between the Slavs&#x27; homeland and the Lower Danube before the Slavs approached the river in the 5th century. Vékony proposes that the Romanians adopted the river&#x27;s Cuman name, &quot;Dunay&quot;, when they reached the Danube during their northward expansion around 1100. In Schramm&#x27;s view, the phonetic changes from &quot;s&quot; to &quot;ʃ&quot; in the names of five large rivers also contradict the continuity theory, because Latin did not contain the latter consonant, thus only non-Romanized natives could transmit it to the peoples who settled in the north-Danubian regions after the Romans abandoned them.

Similarly, historian László Makkai says that the change from &quot;a&quot; to &quot;o&quot; shows that a Slavic-speaking population mediated the ancient names of three large rivers to modern populations (including Romanians), because this vowel shift is attested in the development of the Slavic languages, but is alien to Romanian and other tongues spoken along the rivers. Linguists (including some proponents of the continuity theory) also accept a Slavic mediation which is undeniable in specific cases.

Around half of the longest tributaries of the large riversthose which are longer than 200 kilometershas a name of Slavic origin. In Schramm&#x27;s view, the name of one of them, Dâmbovița, demonstrates that the Romanians reached Wallachia between around 900 and 1200, because it already reflects the change of the Proto-Bulgarian back vowel &quot;ǫ&quot;, but it was borrowed before nasal vowels disappeared from most Bulgarian variants. One of longest tributaries, Bârlad bears a Turkic (Pecheneg or Cuman) name. Almost 50 watercourses (including small rivers and creeks) bear a name of Turkic origin in the Wallachian Plain and river names of Turkic origin also abound in southern Moldavia. The names of the litoral lakes in Dobruja are also of Turkic origin. To explain the great number of Turkic river names, historian Victor Spinei, who supports the continuity theory, proposes that these &quot;bodies of water were not sufficiently important&quot; to the sedentary local Romanians in contrast to the nomadic Turkic peoples who used them as important &quot;permanent markers in the landscape&quot; during their seasonal movements. The longest tributaries of the large rivers in Banat, Crișana and Transylvania had modern names of German, Hungarian, Slavic or Turkic origin, which were also adopted by the Romanians. These tributaries run through the most populated areas where &quot;was a greater likelihood that their names would be lodged in the collective memory&quot;, according to Makkai. In immigrationists scholars&#x27; view, these river names prove that the presence of the Slavs, Hungarians, Transylvanian Saxons predated the arrival of the Romanians who thus must have crossed the Carpathians only after the first Transylvanian Saxon groups settled in southern Transylvania around 1150.

Many small riversall shorter than 100 kilometersand creeks bear a name of Romanian origin in Romania. Most of these watercourses run in the mountainous regions. Based on the Repedea name for the upper course of the river Bistrița (both names meaning &quot;quick&quot; in Romanian and Slavic, respectively), Nandris writes that translations from Romanian into Slavic could also create Romanian hydronyms. Madgearu also says that Bistrița is &quot;most likely a translation&quot; of the Romanian Repedea form. In his view, the distribution of the Romanian river names &quot;coincides with that of a series of archaic cranial features within the restricted area of the Apuseni Mountains&quot;, evincing the early presence of a Romanian-speaking population in the mountainous regions of Transylvania. On the other hand, historian Pál Engel underlines that Romanian place names are dominant only in &quot;areas of secondary human settlement&quot; which &quot;seem to have been colonised during the late Middle Ages&quot;.

Drobeta, Napoca, Porolissum, Sarmizegetusa and other settlements in Dacia Traiana bore names of local origin in Roman times. According to historian Coriolan H. Opreanu (who supports the continuity theory), the survival of the local names proves the native Dacians&#x27; presence in the province at the beginning of the Roman rule. Historian Endre Tóth (who accepts the immigrationist theory) remarks that the native names do not prove the continuity of Dacian settlements, especially because the Roman towns bearing local names developed from military camps and their establishment &quot;generally entailed the annihilation of whatever Dacian settlement there might have been&quot;. Immigrationist scholars emphasize that the names of all Roman settlements attested in Dacia Traiana disappeared after the Romans abandoned the province, in contrast to the names of dozens of Roman towns in the south-Danubian provinces which survived until now. In defense of the continuity theory, Sala proposes that the names of the towns vanished because the Huns destroyed them, but the Daco-Romans endured the Huns&#x27; rule in the villages.

Place names of certainly Slavic, Hungarian and German origin can be found in great number in medieval royal charters pertaining to Banat, Crișana, Maramureș, and Transylvania. In the mountains between the rivers Arieș and Mureș and in the territory to the south of the Târnava Mare River, both the Romanians and the Transylvanian Saxons directly (without Hungarian mediation) adopted the Slavic place names. In almost all cases, when parallel Slavic-Hungarian or Slavic-German names are attested, Romanians borrowed the Slavic forms, suggesting a long cohabitation of the Romanians and the Slavs or a close relationship between the two ethnic groups. The great number of place names of Slavic origin is a clear evidence for the presence of a Slavic-speaking population when the Hungarians started settling in the regions, according to a number of historians. On the other hand, historian Tudor Sălăgean (who supports the continuity theory) states that the name of Slavic origin of a settlement does not itself prove that Slavs inhabited it in the 10th-13th century. Sălăgean underlines that Romanians live in the same settlements in the 21st century and &quot;what is possible in the 21st century was not less possible in 10th century&quot;. According to him, the adoption of the Slavic names by the Romanians in cases when a settlement bears parallel Hungarian or German and Slavic names proves that the Romanians and the Slavs had lived side by side in the same settlements already before the arrival of the Hungarians in the late 9th century. In Makkai&#x27;s contrasting view, the direct adoption of Slavic place names by the Transylvanian Saxons and Romanians proves that significant Slavic-speaking groups lived in southern and central Transylvania when the first Transylvanian Saxon and Romanian groups moved to the region in the second half of the 12th century.

The earliest toponym of certain Romanian origin (Nucșoara from the Romanian word for &quot;walnut&quot;) was recorded in the Kingdom of Hungary in 1359. According to Kristó, the late appearance of Romanian place names indicates that the Romanians insisted on their mobile way of life for a lengthy period after they penetrated into the kingdom and their first permanent settlements appeared only in the second half of the 14th century. The region near the confluence of the Argeș and Lower Danube is called Vlașca. The name clearly shows that a small Romance-speaking community existed in Slavic environment in Wallachia.

No place names mentioned in &quot;Gesta Hungarorum&quot; in Transylvania and Banat are of Romanian origin, but mainly of Hungarian.

Numerous place names of Latin or Romanian origin can be detected in the lands south of the Lower Danube (in present-day Albania, Bulgaria, Bosnia-Hercegovina, Greece, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia). Place names of Latin origin abound in the region of Lake Shkodër, along the rivers Drin and Fan and other territories to the north of the Via Egnatia. According to John Wilkes, they are a clear evidence for the survival of a numerous Romance-speaking populationwhom he associates with the &quot;Romanoi&quot; mentioned by Porphyrogenitusuntil the 9th century. Schramm says that the names of at least eight towns in the same region, likewise suggest the one-time presence of a Romance speaking population in their vicinity. In Schramm and Makkai&#x27;s view, they are consequences of the well-documented 7th-century southward movement of the Latin-speaking groups from the northern Balkan provinces. Romanian place names are concentrated in the wider region of Vlasina (both in present-day Bulgaria and Serbia) and in Montenegro and Kosovo. These names still prove that a significant Romanian-speaking population used to inhabit these territories. In Makkai&#x27;s view, significant groups of Romanians left these territories for the lands to the north of the Lower Danube from the late 12th century and those who stayed behind were assimilated by the neighboring Slavic peoples by the 15th century.

==DNA / Paleogenetics==

The use of genetic data to supplement traditional disciplines has now become mainstream. Given the palimpsest nature of modern genetic diversity, more direct evidence has been sought from ancient DNA (aDNA). Although data from southeastern Europe is still at an incipient stage, general trends are already evident. For example, it has shown that the Neolithic revolution imparted a major demographic impact throughout Europe, disproving the Mesolithic adaptation scenario in its pure form. In fact, the arrival of Neolithic farmers might have been in at least two &quot;waves&quot;, as suggested by a study which analysed mtDNA sequences from Romanian Neolithic samples. This study also shows that &#x27;M_NEO&#x27; (&quot;Middle Neolithic populations that lived in what is present-day Romania/Transylvania&quot;) and modern populations from Romania are very close (but comparison with other populations of Neolithic Anatolian origin was not performed), in contrast with Middle Neolithic and modern populations from Central Europe. However, the samples extracted from Late Bronze Age DNA from Romania are farther from both of the previously mentioned. The authors have stated &quot;Nevertheless, studies on more individuals are necessary to draw definitive conclusions.&quot; However, the study performed a &quot;genetic analysis of a relatively large number of samples of Boian, Zau and Gumelnița cultures in Romania (n = 41) (M_NEO)&quot;

Ancient DNA study on human fossils found in Costișa, Romania, dating from the Bronze Age shows &quot;close genetic kinship along the maternal lineage between the three old individuals from Costișa and some individuals found in other archeological sites dated from the Bronze and Iron Age. We also should note that the point mutations analyzed above are also found in Romanian modern population, suggesting that some old individuals from the human populations living on the Romanian land in the Bronze and Iron Age, could participate to a certain extent in the foundation of the Romanian genetic pool.&quot;

A major demographic wave occurred after 3000 BC from the steppe, postulated to be linked with the expansion of Indo-European languages. Bronze and Iron Age samples from Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania, however, suggest that this impact was less significant for today&#x27;s Southeastern Europe than areas north of the Carpathians. In fact, in the abovementioned studies, the Bronze and Iron Age Balkan samples do not cluster with modern Balkan groups, but lie between Sardinians and other southwestern European groups, suggesting later phenomena (i.e. in Antiquity, Great Migration Period) caused shifts in population genetic structure. However, aDNA samples from southeastern Europe remain few, and only further sampling will allow a clear and diachronic overview of migratory and demographic trends.

No detailed analyses exist from the Roman and early medieval periods. Genome-wide analyses of extant populations show that intra-European diversity is a continuum (with the exception of groups like Finns, Sami, Basques and Sardinians). Romanians cluster amidst their Balkan and East European neighbours. However, they generally lie significantly closer to Balkan groups (Bulgarians and Macedonians) than to central and eastern Europeans like Hungarians, Czechs, Poles and Ukrainians, and many lie in the center of the Balkan cluster, near Albanians, Greeks, and Bulgarians, while many former Yugoslav populations like Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes may draw closer to central European West Slavs. On autosomal studies, genetic distance of some Romanian samples to some Italians, such as Tuscans, is greater than that of the distance to neighboring Balkan peoples.

<text>The Walter A. Haas School of Business (branded as Berkeley Haas) is the business school of the University of California, Berkeley, a public research university in Berkeley, California. It was the first business school at a public university in the United States.

Named after Walter A. Haas, the school is housed in four buildings surrounding a central courtyard on the southeastern corner of the Berkeley campus, where both undergraduate and graduate students attend classes. Its resident startup incubator, Berkeley SkyDeck, is located west of campus in downtown Berkeley. Notable faculty include former Chairs of the Federal Reserve and the Council of Economic Advisors, Nobel laureates in economics, the Secretary of the Treasury, the chief economist of Google, and more.

== History ==
The Haas School of Business was first established as the College of Commerce of the University of California in 1898. As enacted on March 23, 1868, the university&#x27;s Organic Act listed among its goals the provision of &quot;special courses of instruction&quot; for many kinds of &quot;professions,&quot; including &quot;commerce.&quot; University Regents Arthur Rodgers, A.S. Hallidie and George T. Marye Jr. later proposed the establishment of a College of Commerce. The new college was founded on September 13, 1898, when Cora Jane Flood, daughter of industrialist and University of California Regent James C. Flood, donated land (worth one million dollars at the time) to the university specifically to support the study of commerce. The school was one of the first business schools in the United States and the first at a public university.

The college&#x27;s first faculty members included some American pioneers in the field of business. Simon Litman taught the first course in marketing between 1902 and 1908. Adolph Miller, who was the Flood Professor of the Political Economy and Commerce from 1903 to 1915, later served on the first Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Wesley Clair Mitchell, who taught at Berkeley from 1905 to 1913, is known as the father of the business cycle analysis. Charles Staehling taught accounting at the college from 1921 to 1951 and was known for adding a theoretical framework to the praxis-oriented teaching of accounting principles. Henry Mowbray, who taught from 1910 to 1948, wrote the first college textbook on insurance.

The College of Commerce was founded in the liberal arts tradition, drawing on faculty from other disciplines on campus. Carl C. Plehn was appointed the first dean of the new college in 1898. Plehn, a finance professor educated in Germany, drafted the college&#x27;s first curriculum for a Bachelor of Science degree. The initial course offerings covered legal studies, political studies, political economy, and historical studies, including The History of the Institution of Private Property, History and Principles of Commercial Ethics, and the History of Commerce in All Countries and at Every Age. Plehn proposed changes to the curriculum in 1915 to give it a more professional focus. The proposal, adopted after World War I, established a program that included two years of liberal arts education followed by junior and senior year commerce study, a pattern still used for the undergraduate program today.

Henry Rand Hatfield, a pioneer in accounting and an early entrant in the Accounting Hall of Fame, became the second dean of the college in 1916. Hatfield had been hired by the University of California in 1904 as the first full-time accounting professor in the country. Hatfield played a leading role in the founding of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business and the national honor society Beta Gamma Sigma. He also published the first paper in the United States on accounting theory. As dean, Hatfield sought to increase the reputation of the College of Commerce by bringing scholars from the East Coast to teach during summer sessions.

After World War I, enrollment experienced an increase from the influx of veterans and continued to grow even through the Great Depression, increasing from its initial class size of three in 1898 to 1,540 students in 1938. In 1925, the college&#x27;s third dean, Stuart Daggett, instituted a two-year Master of Science degree. The school&#x27;s fourth dean, Henry Francis Grady, was appointed in 1928. Grady went on leave from 1934 to 1936 to become an advisor to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, for whom he worked on reciprocal trade agreements (see Reciprocal Tariff Act). The fifth dean, Robert Calkins, succeeded Grady, but left within a few years to become the dean of the Columbia Business School.

E.T. Grether was appointed the sixth dean of the College of Commerce in 1941. Grether&#x27;s twenty-year tenure as dean was a time of great change. The college was renamed the Department of Business Administration in 1942 and began offering a new two-year upper division curriculum leading to the Bachelor of Science in Business Administration. In 1943, the department was renamed the School of Business Administration when it began offering a one-year graduate program.

Grether opened several research centers in the school, including The Institute for Business and Economics Research (1941), The Institute for Industrial Relations (IIR) (1945, now called the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment), and the Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics (1950). Grether tapped Clark Kerr to be the first director of the IIR. Kerr&#x27;s success in this position led to his becoming the first Chancellor of the University of California, Berkeley.

The Graduate School of Business Administration was opened in 1955 and the school began offering a course of study leading to the Master of Business Administration. A year later the Doctor of Philosophy in Business Administration and executive education programs were founded.

Under the school&#x27;s eighth dean, Richard H. Holton, an evening MBA program was initiated in 1972. Unlike other evening or part-time programs in the country, students were required to meet the same admission requirements as established for the day-time MBA program. Classes for the evening MBA were held in downtown San Francisco until the school&#x27;s present building complex was completed in 1995, the final design of architect Charles Moore.

Earl F. Cheit became the ninth dean of the school in 1976. Facing diminishing funding and budget pressures, Cheit lobbied and won increased salary scales for business faculty. He also secured donations from Walter A. Haas to endow seven new chairs and to open a career planning and placement center. In 1980, the school began to offer a Management of Technology program jointly with the College of Engineering. 1980 also saw the inauguration of the annual Haas Competition in Business and Social Policy, funded by a donation from the Evelyn and Walter A. Haas, Jr. Foundation.

In 1987, the tenth dean of the school, Raymond Miles, began the school&#x27;s first major capital campaign to raise money for a new building. Major contributions were made by Wells Fargo and Eugene Trefethen, an executive with Kaiser Industries. In 1989, the Walter and Elise Haas Fund donated $15 million to the building campaign. The donation was the largest in the history of the university to that date. The school was renamed the Haas School of Business in honor of that gift.

The new building was designed by Charles W. Moore, former chair of Berkeley&#x27;s Department of Architecture. Construction began in 1993 and the school moved into its new building complex in January 1995.

Laura Tyson, a professor at Berkeley since 1977 and the chairman of the President&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers from 1993 to 1995 during the Clinton Administration, was the dean of the school from 1998 to 2001. Tyson negotiated an agreement with the Columbia Business School to create a joint program, the Berkeley-Columbia Executive MBA, which offered experienced executives the opportunity to earn an MBA from both Haas and Columbia. The program lasted for ten years.

Tom Campbell served as dean of Berkeley Haas from 2002 to 2008, with the exception of a one-year sabbatical in 2004-2005 during which he served as Director of the California Department of Finance. During this time, Richard Lyons served as interim dean.

In July 2008, Richard Lyons became the dean of Berkeley Haas. Along with a curriculum overhaul, Lyons launched the public phase of a $300 million capital campaign. The campaign&#x27;s stated goals are &quot;transforming the... campus, building a curriculum based on the Berkeley Haas approach to leadership, and aggressively expanding the school’s faculty and its support for research.&quot; Dean Lyons also oversaw the opening of Berkeley Haas&#x27; fourth building, Connie &amp; Kevin Chou Hall. A six-story, 80,000 sq.ft. building on the north side of the Berkeley Haas campus, Chou Hall cost $60 million and was funded exclusively by alumni and community members. It is the first academic building in the country to be designed for LEED Platinum and WELL certifications, and intended to achieve zero waste certification by summer 2018. Chou Hall opened under temporary occupancy in summer 2017 and was officially completed in 2018.

Ann Harrison began her term as Berkeley Haas dean in January 2019. In July 2024 Harrison stepped down as dean of Berkeley Haas and Jennifer Chatman was named interim Dean.

The Haas School of Business has been home to two winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics. John C. Harsanyi (1920–2000) was a co-recipient with John Nash and Reinhard Selten in 1994 for his contributions to the study of game theory and its application to economics. Oliver Williamson (1932-2020) was a co-recipient with Elinor Ostrom in 2009 for his &quot;analysis of economic governance, especially the boundaries of the firm.&quot; Both have served as Professor Emeritus at Berkeley Haas and in Berkeley&#x27;s Department of Economics.

== Academics ==

=== Graduate programs ===

==== Full-time MBA ====
The Berkeley MBA Program is a two-year curriculum designed to prepare students for business leadership. In addition to its core curriculum and elective courses, Berkeley Haas requires all MBA students to take an Applied Innovation course, such as Haas@Work or International Business Development.

Prospective full-time MBA students may apply to one of three concurrent degree programs; Haas offers a four-semester MBA/MEng program with one of seven programs in the College of Engineering, a five-semester MBA/MPH program with the School of Public Health, and a four-year JD/MBA program with Berkeley Law or the UC College of the Law in San Francisco. Current students may apply to a semester-long exchange program with Columbia Business School, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, IESE Business School, HEC Paris, or London Business School.

==== Evening &amp; Weekend MBA ====
The three-year, part-time Berkeley Evening &amp; Weekend MBA Program allows participants to continue working full-time while pursuing the MBA. The curriculum is aligned with that of the full-time MBA, and students can choose to attend core classes either two evenings per week or all day on Saturdays. Students can also choose to attend core classes in-person or a hybrid of online and in-person (Flex Cohort). 

==== MBA for Executives ====
The Berkeley MBA for Executives program lasts 19 months and consists of courses taught by the full-time faculty of Berkeley Haas. The core curriculum is taught during the first three terms, and the last two terms offer elective courses. Upon completion of the program, students earn the same degree awarded in the school&#x27;s other MBA programs.

Prior to 2013, Berkeley Haas offered the Berkeley-Columbia Executive MBA, which gave experienced executives the opportunity to jointly earn MBAs from both Haas and Columbia Business School.

==== Master of Financial Engineering Program ====
The Berkeley Master of Financial Engineering (MFE) Program provides graduates with knowledge and skills necessary for a career in the finance industry. Students in the MFE program take an integrated set of courses for a period of one year, and must also complete a ten-week internship or on-site project plus an applied finance project that builds on skills learned in the internship.

==== PhD Program ====
The Haas School of Business PhD Program offers six fields of academic study: Accounting, Business and Public Policy, Finance, Marketing, Management of Organizations, and Real Estate. The program admits 14-16 candidates per year, and students can expect to graduate in four to five years.

=== Undergraduate program ===

==== Bachelor of Science ====
The Haas School of Business, in conjunction with the main Berkeley campus, offers an undergraduate Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration (BSBA). Students take a variety of elective courses in addition to required core courses, which include economics, communication, managerial and financial accounting, finance, marketing, and ethics. Students apply to the program after fulfilling undergraduate prerequisite courses, and are admitted to Haas for their final two years.

In July 2022, the Haas School of Business announced the Spieker Undergraduate Business Program, an expansion of its two-year undergraduate business program into a four-year program. This transformation was facilitated by the largest single donation in the school’s history, contributed by Warren “Ned” Spieker, a Berkeley alumnus with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1966, and his wife, Carol Spieker, who earned a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science in 1966. The inaugural first cohort commenced with the incoming class of 2028. 

==== Additional offerings ====

The Haas School of Business offers the BSBA degree with a concentration in Global Management through its Global Management Program (GMP). Starting with the Class of 2029, GMP students spend their sophomore Fall semester at the University of Ghana in Accra, through the UCEAP.
Previous GMP cohorts began the program in the summer prior to their freshman year and spent their first semester in London through Berkeley Global Edge.

The Management, Entrepreneurship, &amp; Technology program, offered by the Haas School of Business and the College of Engineering, is an integrated program that leads to two Bachelor of Science degrees, one in Business Administration from Berkeley Haas and the other in Electrical Engineering &amp; Computer Sciences (EECS), Industrial Engineering &amp; Operations Research (IEOR), or Mechanical Engineering (ME) from the College of Engineering. Students enter the M.E.T. program as freshmen.

The Haas School of Business also partners with the College of Engineering, College of Environmental Design, and College of Letters and Science (Arts and Humanities Division) to sponsor the undergraduate Berkeley Certificate in Design Innovation.

=== Executive education ===
UC Berkeley Executive Education offers a variety of programs for individuals and organizations, to help corporate executives understand new and/or challenging aspects of the business world. Executives can enroll in a prepared set of short courses targeted at specific issues or develop a custom curriculum.

<doc id="367283" wikidata="Q545339" url="?curid=367283" title="Degrees of the University of Oxford">
<text>The system of academic degrees at the University of Oxford originates in the Middle Ages and has evolved since the university&#x27;s founding in 1096.

Almost all undergraduate bachelor&#x27;s degrees at Oxford are titled Bachelor of Arts (BA), apart from the Bachelor of Theology (BTh) and Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA). At the same time, the university offers two bachelor&#x27;s degrees as postgraduate courses – the Bachelor of Civil Law (equivalent to a Master of Laws) and the Bachelor of Philosophy (equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree in philosophy). Previously, other postgraduate courses awarded bachelor&#x27;s degrees, such as the Bachelor of Divinity, but the majority of such courses have since renamed their awards to master&#x27;s degrees.

Seven years after matriculation, BA and BFA graduates may apply to the title of Master of Arts, which is an academic rank at the university and not a postgraduate degree. Integrated master&#x27;s programmes, comprising three years of undergraduate study and one year of postgraduate study, confer a single award (for example, the Master of Mathematics (MMath)). The university offers a number of postgraduate master&#x27;s degrees – chiefly the Master of Philosophy, Master of Science, and Master of Studies. Professional programmes such as the Master of Business Administration, Master of Fine Arts, Master of Public Policy, and Master of Theology are also awarded at Oxford. 

Doctor of Philosophy programmes at the University are typically abbreviated &quot;DPhil&quot; rather than PhD. Oxford also awards a Doctor of Clinical Psychology (DClinPsych) and Doctor of Medicine (DM), in addition to higher doctorates such as the Doctor of Civil Law. In postnominals, &quot;University of Oxford&quot; is normally abbreviated &quot;Oxon.&quot;, which is short for &quot;(Academia) Oxoniensis&quot;, or Oxf.

==Undergraduate awards==
* Bachelor of Arts (BA)
* Bachelor of Fine Art (BFA)

The bachelor&#x27;s degree is awarded soon after the end of the degree course (three or four years after matriculation). Contrary to common UK practice, Oxford does not award bachelor&#x27;s degrees with honours. However, a student whose degree is classified third class or higher is considered &quot;to have achieved honours status&quot;.

Until recently, all undergraduates studied for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The BFA was introduced in 1978. Holders of the degrees of BA and BFA both proceed in time to the degree of Master of Arts (MA). The BA is awarded even for science courses, such as the three-year Physics degree. The degree of Bachelor of Science (BSc) has never been awarded as an undergraduate degree at Oxford. It used to be awarded as a graduate qualification, however.

* Bachelor of Theology (BTh) 

The BTh is awarded primarily to students of the various theological colleges and halls, such as Wycliffe Hall, Regent&#x27;s Park College, Blackfriars, St Stephen&#x27;s House, Ripon College Cuddesdon, Harris Manchester College and the former Westminster College, Oxford. Usually, these students are candidates for the ordained ministry of one of the mainstream Christian denominations, but may be drawn from any faith background (Unitarian ordinands study at HMC) or none at the discretion of the College or Hall. It should not be confused with the degree of bachelor of divinity (BD), which is a postgraduate degree.

* Bachelor of Education (BEd)

The BEd was formerly awarded to students residing at Westminster College, Culham College of Education, the Lady Spencer Churchill College of Education, and Milton Keynes College of Education (formerly the North Buckinghamshire College of Education) who read concurrently at the university.

* Undergraduate Advanced Diploma (UGAdvDip) 
The UGAdvDip is a FHEQ Level 6 award which is equivalent to the third year of undergraduate study and it is generally accepted as equivalent to a second bachelor&#x27;s degree or a Graduate Diploma. Undergraduate Advanced Diplomas are only offered at the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford.

===Undergraduate master&#x27;s degrees===
Beginning in the 1990s, the following degrees were introduced to increase public recognition of the four-year undergraduate science programmes in these subjects:

* Master of Biochemistry (MBiochem)
* Master of Biology (MBiol)
* Master of Biomedical Sciences (MBiomedSci)
* Master of Chemistry (MChem)
* Master of Computer Science (MCompSci)
* Master of Computer Science and Philosophy (MCompSciPhil), first entry 2012
* Master of Earth Sciences (MEarthSci)
* Master of Engineering (MEng), awarded for degrees in both Engineering Science and Materials Science
* Master of Mathematics (MMath)
* Master of Mathematics and Computer Science (MMathCompSci)
* Master of Mathematics and Philosophy (MMathPhil)
* Master of Mathematics and Physics (MMathPhys)
* Master of Physics (MPhys)
* Master of Physics and Philosophy (MPhysPhil)

The holders of these degrees have the academic precedence and standing of BAs until the twenty-first term from matriculation, when they rank as MAs. From 2014 graduates with these degrees wear the same academic gown as a Master of Studies, with a black silk hood lined with sand fabric. Previously the academic dress was simply the BA gown and hood. 

In contrast, science undergraduates at Cambridge may be granted the degree of Master of Natural Sciences (MSci) in addition to the BA (and the subsequent MA).

==Degree of Master of Arts==
The degree of Master of Arts is awarded to BAs and BFAs seven years after matriculation, without further examination, upon the payment of a nominal fee. Recipients of undergraduate master&#x27;s degrees are not eligible to incept as MA, but are afforded the same privileges after the statutory twenty-one terms. This system dates from the Middle Ages, when the study of the liberal arts took seven years.

==Postgraduate degrees==

===Bachelors&#x27; degrees===
* Bachelor of Medicine &amp; Bachelor of Surgery (BM, BCh)
At Oxford, the BM BCh degree is only awarded after the completion of another bachelor&#x27;s degree. Undergraduate medicine students will receive a Bachelor of Arts in Medical Sciences degree at the end of the third year of the six-year programme. Graduates with an existing bachelor&#x27;s degree may apply to a four-year version of the medicine course, which confers only the BM BCh.

* Bachelor of Divinity (BD)
* Bachelor of Letters (BLitt)
* Bachelor of Science (BSc)
* Bachelor of Music (BMus)

In medieval times a student could not study some subjects until study in the liberal arts was completed. These subjects were known as the higher faculties. The Bachelors of Science and Letters were added in the 19th century, and the Bachelors of Philosophy was added in 1914. The higher bachelor&#x27;s degree programme is generally a taught programme of one or two years for graduates. 

* Bachelor of Civil Law (BCL)
* Bachelor of Philosophy (BPhil) (now only awarded in Philosophy)

The only two remaining postgraduate-level courses awarded by the university are the Bachelor of Civil Law and the Bachelor of Philosophy, which are equivalent to master&#x27;s degrees in law and philosophy respectively. 

===Master&#x27;s degrees===
* Master of Philosophy (MPhil)
* Master of Letters (MLitt)
* Master of Science (MSc) (awarded by examination or by research)

The BLitt, BSc, and BPhil (in degrees other than philosophy) were re-titled master&#x27;s degrees.

* Magister Juris (MJur) 
* Master of Studies (MSt)
* Master of Theology (MTh)
* Master of Business Administration (MBA)
* Master of Fine Arts (MFA)
* Master of Public Policy (MPP)

The MJur and MBA are awarded after taught courses, the MJur being the equivalent of the BCL for students from non-common-law backgrounds. The MSt is a one-year hybrid research/taught course which is the equivalent of the taught master&#x27;s degree in most other UK universities. The MTh is an applied theology course for those intending to enter holy orders. 

* Master of Education (MEd)
The degree of Master of Education was formerly awarded to students at Westminster College, when that course was validated by the university.

===Diplomas===

Historically at Oxford and Cambridge, a Diploma was a postgraduate qualification – for instance, the Cambridge Diploma in Computer Science. The title of Diploma has nonetheless mostly been replaced by the more common master&#x27;s degree. 

To distinguish &quot;postgraduate&quot; diplomas from graduate or undergraduate diplomas at other institutions, Oxford uses the term &quot;postgraduate diploma&quot;. The Centre of Continuing Education offers part time diplomas in a number of specialised areas, and other faculties also offer postgraduate diploma courses such as the &quot;Postgraduate Diploma in Intellectual Property Law and Practice&quot; offered by the law faculty.

===Doctorates===

* Doctor of Divinity (DD)
* Doctor of Civil Law (DCL)
* Doctor of Medicine (DM)
* Doctor of Letters (DLitt)
* Doctor of Science (DSc)
* Doctor of Music (DMus)

Graduates in subjects other than Medicine can proceed to a doctorate without further examination on presentation of evidence of an important contribution to their subject, such as a series of influential published works. 

Higher doctorates s may also be awarded &quot;honoris causa&quot;, or as honorary degrees. It is traditional for the chancellor to be made a DCL &quot;jure officio&quot; (by virtue of his office). Until the 19th century all bishops who had studied at Oxford were made DDs &quot;jure officio&quot;.

* Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil)

The DPhil is a research degree, modelled on the German and American PhD, that was introduced in 1914. Oxford was the first university in the UK to accept this innovation.

* Doctor of Clinical Psychology (DClinPsychol)

The degree of DClinPsychol is the only professional doctorate at Oxford.

==Order of academic standing==

Members of the University of Oxford are ranked according to their degree. The order is as follows:

* Doctor of Divinity
* Doctor of Civil Law
* Doctor of Medicine if also a Master of Arts
* Doctor of Letters if also a Master of Arts

* Master of Education if not also a Master of Arts
* Master of Business Administration if not also a Master of Arts
* Master of Fine Art if not also a Master of Arts
* Master of Public Policy if not also a Master of Arts
* Bachelor of Divinity
* Bachelor of Civil Law

* Bachelor of Fine Art
* Bachelor of Theology
* Bachelor of Education

Within each degree the holders are ranked by the date on which they proceeded to their degree. In the case of people who graduated on the same day they are ranked by alphabetical order.

If the Degree of Master of Biochemistry, or Chemistry, or Computer Science, or Earth Sciences, or Engineering, or Mathematics, or Mathematics and Computer Science, or Mathematics and Philosophy, or Physics, or Physics and Philosophy, is held together with a higher degree, the holder will rank in precedence equally with a person who holds the same higher degree together with the Degree of Master of Arts.

<text>The Buckfast bee is a breed of honey bee, a cross of many subspecies and their strains, developed by Brother Adam (born Karl Kehrle in 1898 in Germany), who was in charge of beekeeping from 1919 at Buckfast Abbey in Devon in the United Kingdom. Breeding of the Buckfast bee is now done by breeders throughout Europe belonging to the &quot;Federation of European Buckfast Beekeepers&quot; (G.D.E.B.). This organization maintains a pedigree for Buckfast bees, originating from the time of Brother Adam.

In 1916, only 16 surviving colonies were left in the abbey. All of them were either Ligurian (&quot;A. m. ligustica&quot;) from Italy or Ligurian queens mated with the English black bee (a now extinct phenotype of the &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot;); by 1919 these bees too had died causing Brother Adam to import queens again from Italy and also France, from which he began to develop what would come to be known as the Buckfast bee.

== Origin and Heritage ==
According to Brother Adam&#x27;s personal notes, 1915 was &quot;The last season colonies of the former native honeybee (the British strain of &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot;) existed in this neighbourhood before its final extermination by the Isle of Wight epidemic, in 1916 only bees of or descended from the Italian Ligurian strain of the &quot;A. m. ligustica&quot; had survived. An isolated mating station was established on Dartmoor in June 1925, prior to this date matings were random. In 1919 a queen, later named as B-1, was raised that &quot;embodied all the desirable qualities of the Ligurian and former Native in an ideal combination&quot;; it is from this queen that the Buckfast bees can trace their ancestry back to.

The following is a list of the subspecies (and strains if stated) that were later included in the Buckfast breeding program by Brother Adam, not all were eventually included into the Buckfast breed: &quot;Buckfast&quot; (B1), &quot;A. m. ligustica&quot; (Ligurian strain; all other strains proved susceptible to Acarine, especially those imported from the U.S. and of an all-golden color), &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; (Gale&#x27;s French, Brown Provence, Swedish and Finnish strains; the Irish strain proved itself even more susceptible to Acarine than the British strain), &quot;A. m. cypria&quot;, &quot;A. m. carnica&quot;, &quot;A. m. cecropia&quot;, &quot;A. m. meda&quot; (Iraqi and Iranian strains), &quot;A. m. sahariensis&quot;, &quot;A. m. anatoliaca&quot; (Turkish and Armenian strains), &quot;A. m. caucasica&quot;, &quot;A. m. lamarckii&quot;, &quot;A. m. monticola&quot; (Mount Elgon strain), &quot;A. m. adami&quot; and &quot;A. m. macedonica&quot; (Mount Athos strain).

In 1971 other bee breeders began to join the Buckfast breeding program and established their own isolated mating stations, as well as using instrumental insemination, today the breeding of pedigree Buckfast bees is regulated by the &quot;Federation of European Buckfast Beekeepers&quot; (G.D.E.B.) in over twenty six countries with numerous breeders.

== History ==
Its developer Brother Adam was inspired by the survival of the Italian (&quot;A. m. ligustica&quot;) × dark bee (&quot;A. m. mellifera&quot;) crosses when the Isle of Wight disease, later identified as Acarine, reached Buckfast Abbey. To be able to control the matings, he started to use an isolated valley in Dartmoor. With no other bees within range, Brother Adam could maintain their genetic integrity and develop desirable traits. Brother Adam investigated various honey bee subspecies and made many long journeys in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, searching for desirable characteristics within local strains, he also had queens imported to include in his breeding program. The book &quot;In Search of the Best Strains of Bee&quot; tells about his travels in search of genetic building blocks.

Every new bee subspecies or strain was first crossed with the existing Buckfast bees. In many cases, the new desired qualities were passed on to the next generation and the new combination was then made stable with further breeding work. Every crossing with a new type of bee took about 10 years before the desired genes were fixed in the breed. Over 70 years, Brother Adam succeeded in developing a vigorous, healthy and fecund honey bee, which was named the Buckfast bee.

The Buckfast bee is popular among beekeepers and is available from bee breeders in Germany, Ireland, the United Kingdom, France and other places. The Buckfast bees&#x27; qualities are very favourable, sometimes referred to as &quot;the beekeepers bee&quot;. They are non-aggressive and highly productive. Brother Adam, in his book, &quot;Beekeeping at Buckfast Abbey&quot;, writes that in 1920 they obtained &quot;an average of no less than 192 lbs [87 kg] surplus per colony and individual yields exceeding 3 cwt [= 336 lbs or 152 kg].&quot; In the 1986 BBC-affiliated documentary, &quot;The Monk and the Honey Bee&quot;, more than 400 pounds (181 kg) of honey are reported to have been produced by a single Buckfast colony.

== Buckfast breeding programme ==
The qualities and characteristics desired in the Buckfast bee breeding can be divided into three groups: primary, secondary and tertiary.

=== Primary ===
These are the basic qualities of economic importance and form the primary aim in breeding:
* Industry – a boundless capacity for (foraging) work is doubtless the foremost requirement.
* Fecundity – the queen at a certain point (relative to the nectar flow) must be able to fill at least eight or nine Dadant combs with brood.
* Resistance to disease – is absolutely indispensable and essential to successful beekeeping.
* Disinclination to swarm – an indispensable prerequisite in modern beekeeping.

=== Secondary ===
These are of great importance as each contributes its respective share to an intensification of the honey gathering ability of the colony:
* Longevity – prolongation of the lifespan of the bee will denote a corresponding increase in the effective foraging force and capacity of a colony.
* Wing-power – the ability to forage further can prove a material factor in the performance of a colony.
* Keen sense of smell – without this a colony would not forage further, so it is closely linked with wing-power.
* Instinct of defense – this is the most effective remedy against robbing (it is not to be confused with aggression against the beekeeper).
* Hardiness and wintering ability – the ability to winter on stores of inferior quality for long periods without a cleansing flight.
* Spring development – must not occur prematurely and without the need for artificial stimulation.
* Thrift or frugality – a quality closely connected with the seasonal development of colonies.
* Instinct of self provisioning – seasonally appropriate brood chamber storage for overwintering.
* Comb building – a keenness to build comb seems to increase the zest for every form of activity of economic value.
* Gathering of pollen – not to be confused with the collecting of nectar; good quality pollen positively affects longevity.

=== Tertiary ===
These qualities help to reduce to a minimum the time and effort involved in the seasonal care and attention demanded to ensure maximum production results per colony:
* Good temper – non-aggression is a quality desired by all beekeepers. Aggression is a trait common in the M Lineage, such as the &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot;, but docility is a characteristic of the C Lineage, such as the &quot;A. m. ligustica&quot;, which the Buckfast bee is most closely related to.
* Calm behavior - bees that stay calm when they are manipulated (inspected) will greatly facilitate the work of beekeeping.
* Disinclination to propolize – excess propolis can increase the work of the beekeeper.
* Freedom from brace comb – the presence of brace comb renders the inspection and manipulation of combs not only a difficult and arduous task, but may also cause the death of the queen.
* The art of making attractive cappings – good cappings are of special importance where sections are produced, a trait which seems tied up with and dependent on many factors.
* Keen sense of orientation – helps to ensure that the bees return to their own hive, thereby avoiding the many drawbacks and risks drifting entails, and an undue loss of queens returning from their mating flights.

== Characteristics ==
===Performance against other bees===
Brother Adam, in comparing the Buckfast bee to the &quot;A. m. ligustica&quot;, (which the Buckfast bee is directly descended from and most closely related to) observed that it was more industrious, more thrifty, less disposed to swarm and more resistant to disease especially Acarine (tracheal mites).
Compared to most subspecies of bees the Buckfast bee collects less propolis, keeps restful in winter, but builds up rapidly at the appropriate time in spring time (in England / northern Europe) and maintains a maximum effective colony strength throughout the summer, enabling full advantage of the honey flow to be taken whenever it sets in. As for temper, the Buckfast bee is unusually docile and will tolerate handling in unfavourable weather. A pure Buckfast bee will swarm, but it is little disposed to do so and, of course, it has a good reputation of an unusual honey-gathering ability.

In a scientific study in Poland from 2009 to 2010, in which the economic traits of pure Buckfast bees and a hybrid cross of &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; and &quot;A. m. caucasia&quot; were compared, the Buckfast bee was shown to have a larger brood area, greater increase and strength in the build-up to spring, also on the last inspection of the year the Buckfast colonies were observed to be stronger as well. The honey extracted during spring and summer was larger from the Buckfast hives, with the overall honey extracted being 34.45% greater, with less variation between hives when compared to the &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; x &quot;caucasia&quot; (NB: the crossing of two bee subspecies would have resulted in heterosis, meaning the &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; x &quot;caucasia&quot; would have obtained better results than if the study had only used a pure subspecies, such as the &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; or the &quot;A. m. caucasia&quot;).

In a similar scientific study, also in Poland, but in field and laboratory conditions, the foraging and hoarding abilities of three colonies were compared, 1) pure Buckfast, 2) a hybrid &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; (from Norway) x &quot;A. m. caucasia&quot; and 3) a hybrid &quot;A. m. caucasia&quot; x &quot;A. m. carnica&quot;. The Buckfast colony collected 2.1% less syrup than the &quot;A. m. caucasia&quot; x &quot;carnica&quot;, but stored 24.8% more in stores, showing a greater efficiency in processing and less consumption of the syrup collected. The Buckfasts collected and stored 38.2% more syrup than the &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; x &quot;caucasia&quot;.

===Hybrid vigor to maximize yield===
Even though the pure Buckfast bee has a claim to an unusual honey-gathering ability, returns can be maximized through hybrid vigor (heterosis) by crossing pure Buckfast, usually on the paternal side, with other subspecies. However, not all crosses will produce desirable qualities according to Brother Adam, often the swarming tendency is increased so much that it affects the honey yield. The following crosses were found to provide excellent results without increasing the swarming instinct: &quot;A. m. anatoliaca&quot; queen x Buckfast drones; Buckfast queen x &quot;A. m. carnica&quot; or &quot;A. m. cecropia&quot; drones; &quot;A. m. cecropia&quot; queen x Buckfast or &quot;A. m. carnica&quot; drones. But the following was found to maximize the swarming instinct: &quot;A. m. mellifera&quot; or &quot;A. m. intermissa&quot; or &quot;A. m. carnica&quot; queens x Buckfast drones.

===Varroa resistance of different Buckfast strains===
In a study conducted by Oddie, Dahle and Neumann a Norwegian originally buckfast strain was discovered to be varroa resistant.
In Finland (Lundén Apiaries) and Sweden (Österlund Apiaries) there are buckfast strains confirmed to be varroa resistant by other breeders.

===Varroa sensitive hygiene===
A breeding project was begun in the Netherlands in 2014 by Stichting Arista Bee Research, with the goal of producing a &quot;Varroa&quot;-resistant bee, by using Single Drone Insemination to enhance the Varroa Sensitive Hygiene (VSH) behavior. By importing semen in 2013 from VSH colonies in the U.S., they worked with Buckfast beekeepers from Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, France and the Netherlands and were able to produce colonies that were completely &quot;Varroa&quot;-resistant without the use of any treatments. Although the genetic base of this Buckfast VSH strain is very narrow, as selection has only been limited to this trait and no resources have been available yet to structurally integrate it into the broader population, it has shown that VSH behavior is present in European high quality Buckfast breeding stock and can be brought to high percentages, the next step in the breeding program will be to further select toward 100% VSH in the entire EU breeding stock. In 2018 it was announced that varroa resistant Buckfast bees (daughters of VSH open mated Queens) would be made available for sale in 2019.

<text>Jude Thaddeus Wanniski (June 17, 1936 – August 29, 2005) was an American journalist, conservative commentator, and political economist.

==Early life and education==
Wanniski was born in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, the son of Constance, who worked at an accounting firm, and Michael Wanniski, an itinerant butcher. His father was of Polish descent and his mother was a Scottish immigrant. When he was still very young, his family moved to Brooklyn, where his father became a book binder. His grandfather was a Pennsylvania coal miner and a dedicated Communist who gave his grandson a copy of &quot;Das Kapital&quot; for his high school graduation.

==Career==
After college, Wanniski worked as a reporter and columnist in Alaska. From 1961 to 1965 he worked at &quot;The Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot; as a political columnist, where he taught himself economics.

In 1965, Wanniski moved to Washington, D.C., to work as a columnist for the &quot;National Observer&quot;, published by Dow Jones.

From 1972 to 1978, Wanniski was the associate editor of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. He left after being discovered at a New Jersey train station distributing leaflets supporting a Republican senatorial candidate, an act considered an ethics violation.

In 1978, Wanniski started Polyconomics, an economics forecasting firm, where he and his analysts advised corporations, investment banks and others.

He also began directly advising politicians on economic policy, first candidate Ronald Reagan and later presidential hopefuls Jack Kemp and Steve Forbes. He helped design the tax cuts made during Reagan&#x27;s first term in office. His formal role as a Reagan adviser ended after an interview he gave to the &quot;Village Voice&quot; was published under the headline &quot;The Battle for Reagan&#x27;s Mind.&quot;

In the late 1990s, Wanniski developed a friendship with the controversial leader of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan, stating in 1997: &quot;My wife Patricia and I spent the four-day July 4th weekend in Chicago at the International Islamic Conference, hosted by the Nation of Islam, in conjunction with the World Islamic Peoples Leadership. It may have been the single most important political event I have witnessed in my life. ... What made the event so important was that when the weekend began, Farrakhan was the spiritual leader of 200,000 members of the Nation of Islam and clearly the most influential of 33 million African-Americans. At its conclusion, Farrakhan stands a good chance at uniting 1.2 billion Muslims under his spiritual leadership.&quot;

Polyconomics as a corporation ceased operations on June 30, 2006, ten months after Wanniski&#x27;s death, but the name (a combination of &quot;politics&quot; and &quot;economics&quot;) lives on at The Polyconomics Institute, where one can find the Wanniski&#x27;s collected works for Polyconomics, as well as correspondence with economic policy makers, and lectures.

==Economic and political beliefs==
Wanniski consistently advocated the reduction of trade barriers, the elimination of capital gains taxes, and a return to the gold standard.

===Lower taxes===
Wanniski was instrumental in popularizing the ideas of lower tax rates embodied in the &quot;Laffer Curve&quot; and was present in 1974 when Arthur Laffer drew the curve on the famous napkin for Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld.

A simplified view of the theory is that tax revenues would be zero if tax rates were either 0% or 100% and somewhere in between 0% and 100% is a tax rate that maximizes total revenue. Laffer&#x27;s postulate was that the tax rate that maximizes revenue was at a much lower level than previously believed, so low that current tax rates were above the level for revenue to be maximized.

Many economists were skeptical that it was true in practice. Wanniski suggested that the United States was on the wrong side of the Laffer curve.

===The Two Santa Claus Theory===
The Two Santa Claus Theory is a political theory and strategy published by Wanniski in 1976, which he promoted within the United States Republican Party. The theory states that in democratic elections, if members of the rival Democratic Party appeal to voters by proposing programs to help people, then the Republicans cannot gain broader appeal by proposing less spending. The first &quot;Santa Claus&quot; of the theory title refers to the Democrats who promise programs to help the disadvantaged. The &quot;Two Santa Claus Theory&quot; recommends that the Republicans must assume the role of a second Santa Claus by not arguing to cut spending but offering the option of cutting taxes.

According to Wanniski, the theory is simple. In 1976, he wrote that the Two-Santa Claus Theory suggests that &quot;the Republicans should concentrate on tax-rate reduction. As they succeed in expanding incentives to produce, they will move the economy back to full employment and thereby reduce social pressures for public spending. Just as an increase in Government spending inevitably means taxes must be raised, a cut in tax rates—by expanding the private sector—will diminish the relative size of the public sector.&quot; Wanniski suggested this position, as left-liberal observer Thom Hartmann has clarified, so that the Democrats would &quot;have to be anti-Santas by raising taxes, or anti-Santas by cutting spending. Either one would lose them elections.&quot;

===&quot;The Way the World Works&quot;===
Wanniski&#x27;s 1978 book, &quot;The Way the World Works&quot;, documented his theory that the United States Senate&#x27;s floor votes on the Smoot–Hawley tariff legislation coincided day to day with the Wall Street stock market Crash of 1929, and that the Great Depression was the result of the Smoot–Hawley tariff, rather than any failure of classical economics.

===Iraq===
Wanniski is also notable for his journalism on the alleged weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in Iraq. As early as 1997, Wanniski posted columns on his website alleging that after November 1991, inspectors of UNSCOM had never found WMD in Iraq but had found and destroyed all of Iraq&#x27;s WMD programs with the help of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime in the months following the first Gulf War. Wanniski not only recognized the prospective importance of the Iraqi WMD question before other journalists, but also argued correctly that Iraq had no WMD and stated that the US would never allow UNSCOM to end the inspections regime regardless of what Iraq did.

He became a somewhat controversial figure in the conservative movement at the beginning of 2003, when he vocally opposed the impending US war with Iraq. On October 27, 2004, he publicly denounced President George W. Bush, saying, &quot;Mr. Bush has become an imperialist—one whose decisions as commander-in-chief have made the world a more dangerous place.&quot; Eventually Wanniski endorsed the 2004 Democratic candidate, Senator John Kerry, although he clearly preferred the Republican platform on issues related to taxation.

Wanniski&#x27;s last published work was an article for the 2005 IHS Press antiwar anthology, &quot;Neo-Conned!&quot;

==Influence==
Wanniski has been credited with coining the term supply-side economics to distinguish it against the more dominant &quot;demand-side&quot; Keynesian and monetarist theories. He, however, thought the actual phrase should be credited to Herbert Stein, for Stein&#x27;s phrase &quot;supply-side fiscalists.&quot;

The rising GOP star Jack Kemp became a supply-side economics advocate due to Wanniski&#x27;s tutelage, and would work to put his proposals into legislative practice.

&quot;The Way the World Works&quot; was named one of the 100 most influential books of the 20th century by &quot;National Review&quot; magazine. Conservative commentator Robert D. Novak said, in the introduction to the 20th anniversary edition (1998) of the book, that it was one of two books that &quot;shaped [Novak&#x27;s] mature philosophy of politics and government.&quot; (Whittaker Chambers&#x27; &quot;Witness&quot; is the other.)

Starting in 1987, Wanniski edited an annual &quot;Media Guide&quot; in which he rated pundits on a four-star scale. Some conservatives, such as George F. Will and Norman Podhoretz, received only a single star.

In 1998, Wanniski attempted to foster dialogue between Louis Farrakhan and those who had labeled him antisemitic. He arranged for Farrakhan to be interviewed by reporter Jeffrey Goldberg, who had written for the Jewish weekly &quot;The Forward&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The extensive interview was never published in either publication, and Wanniski posted it on his website in the context of a memorandum to Senator Joe Lieberman.

==Death==
Wanniski died of a heart attack on August 29, 2005, in Morristown, New Jersey, while working at his desk. He was survived by his wife, Patricia, and children Matthew, Andrew, Jennifer Harlan, his brother Terrance Wanniski and sister Ruth Necco.

At the time of his death, Wanniski was at the low point of his political influence, according to longtime friend Robert Novak. He was running his economic consultancy from its Parsippany offices. He spoke of having many Wall Street clients, although he complained that some had left due to his politics. He posted personal commentaries several times a week on his personal website, on topics ranging from international politics and trade policy to reviews of films.

<doc id="367289" wikidata="Q104840552" url="?curid=367289" title="Flame-bladed sword">
<text>A flame-bladed sword or wave-bladed sword has a characteristically undulating style of blade. The wave in the blade is often considered to contribute a flame-like quality to the appearance of a sword. The dents on the blade can appear parallel or in a zig-zag manner. The two most common flame-bladed swords are rapiers or &quot;Zweihänders&quot;. A flame-bladed sword was not exclusive to a certain country or region. The style of blade can be found on swords from modern-day Germany, France, Spain, and Switzerland.

== &quot;Flambard&quot;, &quot;Flammard&quot;, and &quot;Flammenschwert&quot; ==

The two-handed flame-bladed sword is referred to by the German &quot;Flammenschwert&quot; (literally &quot;flame-sword&quot;). These swords are very similar to the two-handed sword or &quot;Zweihänder&quot;, the only difference being the blade. The design of the blade is decorative along with being functional by causing unpleasant vibrations when parried. Still, the undulating blade is no more effective at cutting than a straight one. An advantage over swords with a straight blade is that a waved blade could better distribute the force of impact and thus was less likely to break. It could also threaten the opponent in a duel and may have discouraged them from grabbing the blade. Like other &quot;Zweihänders&quot;, they were used during the 16th century by the &quot;Landsknechts&quot; (well-trained and experienced swordsmen) for single-fights, protecting castle/town walls, or sometimes to protect the banner on the battlefield.

== &quot;Flamberge&quot; ==

&quot;Flamberge&quot; (&quot;flaming&quot;), from the French &quot;flamber&quot;, is a term with many connotations, including swords without the flamed-blade. 
The term is a frequent name or alias for swords in medieval chansons de geste and romances, where it often just means a large sword. Egerton Castle used the term to refer to swords that were a transition from the rapier to the smallsword. These swords did not necessarily have an undulated blade. Castle makes note of this being the case of certain Swiss rapiers, but &quot;flamberge&quot; quickly became a disdainful term in France to refer to flamboyant swords. This comes from the French expression &quot;Mettre flamberge au vent&quot;, meaning &quot;To put [the sword] in the wind&quot;. Here, it is suggested that the wielder of the sword likened it to the mythical sword Durendal, which alternatively was called &quot;flamberge&quot;. 

==Freemason Flame-bladed swords==

Freemason lodges have used flame-bladed swords in their ceremonies, and some still at least possess swords. There is one in the museum at the Grand Lodge Freemason&#x27;s Hall in London. Freemasonry sources suggest a symbolic connection to the ‘flaming sword’ from the Book of Genesis 3:24.

<doc id="367290" wikidata="Q626021" url="?curid=367290" title="Say's law">
<text>In classical economics, Say&#x27;s law, or the law of markets, is the claim that the production of a product creates demand for another product by providing something of value which can be exchanged for that other product. So, production is the source of demand. In his principal work, &quot;A Treatise on Political Economy&quot; &quot;A product is no sooner created, than it, from that instant, affords a market for other products to the full extent of its own value.&quot; And also, &quot;As each of us can only purchase the productions of others with his/her own productions – as the value we can buy is equal to the value we can produce, the more men can produce, the more they will purchase.&quot;

Some maintain that Say further argued that this law of markets implies that a general glut (a widespread excess of supply over demand) cannot occur. If there is a surplus of one good, there must be unmet demand for another: &quot;If certain goods remain unsold, it is because other goods are not produced.&quot; However, according to Petur Jonsson, Say does not claim a general glut cannot occur and in fact acknowledges that they can occur. Say&#x27;s law has been one of the principal doctrines used to support the laissez-faire belief that a capitalist economy will naturally tend toward full employment and prosperity without government intervention.

Over the years, at least two objections to Say&#x27;s law have been raised:
* General gluts do occur, particularly during recessions and depressions.
* Economic agents may collectively choose to increase the amount of savings they hold, thereby reducing demand but not supply.

Say&#x27;s law was generally accepted throughout the 19th century, though modified to incorporate the idea of a &quot;boom-and-bust&quot; cycle. During the worldwide Great Depression of the 1930s, the theories of Keynesian economics disputed Say&#x27;s conclusions.

Scholars disagree on the question of whether it was Say who first stated the principle, but by convention, &quot;Say&#x27;s law&quot; has been another name for the law of markets ever since John Maynard Keynes used the term in the 1930s.

== History ==

=== Say&#x27;s formulation ===
Say argued that economic agents offer goods and services for sale so that they can spend the money they expect to obtain. Therefore, the fact that a quantity of goods and services is offered for sale is evidence of an equal quantity of demand. Essentially Say&#x27;s argument was that money is just a medium, people pay for goods and services with other goods and services. This claim is often summarized as &quot;supply creates its own demand&quot;, although that phrase does not appear in Say&#x27;s writings.

Explaining his point at length, Say wrote:

It is worthwhile to remark that a product is no sooner created than it, from that instant, affords a market for other products to the full extent of its own value. When the producer has put the finishing hand to his product, he is most anxious to sell it immediately, lest its value should diminish in his hands. Nor is he less anxious to dispose of the money he may get for it; for the value of money is also perishable. But the only way of getting rid of money is in the purchase of some product or other. Thus the mere circumstance of creation of one product immediately opens a vent for other products.

Say further argued that because production necessarily creates demand, a &quot;general glut&quot; of unsold goods of all kinds is impossible. If there is an excess supply of one good, there must be a shortage of another: &quot;The superabundance of goods of one description arises from the deficiency of goods of another description.&quot;

To further clarify, he wrote: &quot;Sales cannot be said to be dull because money is scarce, but because other products are so. ... To use a more hackneyed phrase, people have bought less, because they have made less profit.&quot;

Say&#x27;s law should therefore be formulated as: Supply of X creates demand for Y, subject to people being interested in buying X. The producer of X is able to buy Y, if his products are demanded.

Say rejected the possibility that money obtained from the sale of goods could remain unspent, thereby reducing demand below supply. He viewed money only as a temporary medium of exchange.

Money performs but a momentary function in this double exchange; and when the transaction is finally closed, it will always be found, that one kind of commodity has been exchanged for another.

=== Early opinions ===
Early writers on political economy held a variety of opinions on what we now call Say&#x27;s law. James Mill and David Ricardo both supported the law in full. Thomas Malthus and John Stuart Mill questioned the doctrine that general gluts cannot occur.

James Mill and David Ricardo restated and developed Say&#x27;s law. Mill wrote, &quot;The production of commodities creates, and is the one and universal cause which creates, a market for the commodities produced.&quot; Ricardo wrote, &quot;Demand depends only on supply.&quot;

Thomas Malthus, on the other hand, rejected Say&#x27;s law because he saw evidence of general gluts.

We hear of glutted markets, falling prices, and cotton goods selling at Kamschatka lower than the costs of production. It may be said, perhaps, that the cotton trade happens to be glutted; and it is a tenet of the new doctrine on profits and demand, that if one trade be overstocked with capital, it is a certain sign that some other trade is understocked. But where, I would ask, is there any considerable trade that is confessedly under-stocked, and where high profits have been long pleading in vain for additional capital?

John Stuart Mill also recognized general gluts. He argued that during a general glut, there is insufficient demand for all non-monetary commodities and excess demand for money.

When there is a general anxiety to sell, and a general disinclination to buy, commodities of all kinds remain for a long time unsold, and those which find an immediate market, do so at a very low price... At periods such as we have described... persons in general... liked better to possess money than any other commodity. Money, consequently, was in request, and all other commodities were in comparative disrepute... As there may be a temporary excess of any one article considered separately, so may there of commodities generally, not in consequence of over-production, but of a want of commercial confidence.

Mill rescued the claim that there cannot be a simultaneous glut of all commodities by including money as one of the commodities.

 In order to render the argument for the impossibility of an excess of all commodities applicable... money must itself be considered as a commodity. It must, undoubtedly, be admitted that there cannot be an excess of all other commodities, and an excess of money at the same time.

Contemporary economist Brad DeLong believes that Mill&#x27;s argument refutes the assertions that a general glut cannot occur, and that a market economy naturally tends towards an equilibrium in which general gluts do not occur. What remains of Say&#x27;s law, after Mill&#x27;s modification, are a few less controversial assertions:
* In the long run, the ability to produce does not outstrip the desire to consume.
* In a barter economy, a general glut cannot occur.
* In a monetary economy, a general glut occurs not because sellers produce more commodities of every kind than buyers wish to purchase, but because buyers increase their desire to hold money.

Say himself never used many of the later, short definitions of Say&#x27;s law, and thus the law actually developed through the work of many of his contemporaries and successors. The work of James Mill, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, and others evolved Say&#x27;s law into what is sometimes called &quot;law of markets&quot;, which was a key element of the framework of macroeconomics from the mid-19th century until the 1930s.

=== The Great Depression ===
The Great Depression posed a challenge to Say&#x27;s law. In the United States, unemployment rose to 25%. The quarter of the labor force that was unemployed constituted a supply of labor for which the demand predicted by Say&#x27;s law did not exist.

John Maynard Keynes argued in 1936 that Say&#x27;s law is simply not true, and that demand, rather than supply, is the key variable that determines the overall level of economic activity. According to Keynes, demand depends on the propensity of individuals to consume and on the propensity of businesses to invest, both of which vary throughout the business cycle. There is no reason to expect enough aggregate demand to produce full employment.

=== Today ===
Steven Kates, although a proponent of Say&#x27;s law, writes:
Before the Keynesian Revolution, [the] denial of the validity of Say&#x27;s Law placed an economist amongst the crackpots, people with no idea whatsoever about how an economy works. That the vast majority of the economics profession today would have been classified as crackpots in the 1930s and before is just how it is.
Keynesian economists, such as Paul Krugman, stress the role of money in negating Say&#x27;s law: Money that is hoarded (held as cash or analogous financial instruments) is not spent on products. To increase monetary holdings, someone may sell products or labor without immediately spending the proceeds. This can be a general phenomenon: from time to time, in response to changing economic circumstances, households and businesses in aggregate seek to increase net savings and thus decrease net debt. To increase net savings requires earning more than is spent—contrary to Say&#x27;s law, which postulates that supply (sales, earning income) equals demand (purchases, requiring spending). Keynesian economists argue that the failure of Say&#x27;s law, through an increased demand for monetary holdings, can result in a general glut due to falling demand for goods and services.

Many economists today maintain that supply does not create its own demand, but instead, especially during recessions, demand creates its own supply. Krugman writes:

Not only doesn&#x27;t supply create its own demand; experience since 2008 suggests, if anything, that the reverse is largely true -- specifically, that inadequate demand destroys supply. Economies with persistently weak demand seem to suffer large declines in potential as well as actual output.

Olivier Blanchard and Larry Summers, observing persistently high and increasing unemployment rates in Europe in the 1970s and 1980s, argued that adverse demand shocks can lead to persistently high unemployment, therefore persistently reducing the supply of goods and services.
Antonio Fatás and Larry Summers argued that shortfalls in demand, resulting both from the global economic downturn of 2008 and 2009 and from subsequent attempts by governments to reduce government spending, have had large negative effects on both actual and potential world economic output.

A minority of economists still support Say&#x27;s law. Some proponents of real business cycle theory maintain that high unemployment is due to a reduced labor supply rather than reduced demand. In other words, people choose to work less when economic conditions are poor, so that involuntary unemployment does not actually exist.

While economists have abandoned Say&#x27;s law as a true law that must always hold, most still consider Say&#x27;s law to be a useful rule of thumb which the economy will tend towards in the long run, so long as it is allowed to adjust to shocks such as financial crises without being exposed to any further such shocks. The applicability of Say&#x27;s law in theoretical long-run conditions is one motivation behind the study of general equilibrium theory in economics, which studies economies in the context where Say&#x27;s law holds true.

== Consequences ==
A number of laissez-faire consequences have been drawn from interpretations of Say&#x27;s law. However, Say himself advocated public works to remedy unemployment and criticized Ricardo for neglecting the possibility of hoarding if there was a lack of investment opportunities.

=== Recession and unemployment ===

Say argued against claims that businesses suffer because people do not have enough money. He argued that the power to purchase can only be increased through more production.

James Mill used Say&#x27;s law against those who sought to give the economy a boost via unproductive consumption. In his view, consumption destroys wealth, in contrast to production, which is the source of economic growth. The demand for a product determines the price of the product.

According to Keynes (see more below), if Say&#x27;s law is correct, widespread involuntary unemployment (caused by inadequate demand) cannot occur. Classical economists in the context of Say&#x27;s law explain unemployment as arising from insufficient demand for specialized labour—that is, the supply of viable labour exceeds demand in some segments of the economy.

When more goods are produced by firms than are demanded in certain sectors, the suppliers in those sectors lose revenue as result. This loss of revenue, which would in turn have been used to purchase other goods from other firms, lowers demand for the products of firms in other sectors, causing an overall general reduction in output and thus lowering the demand for labour. This results in what contemporary macroeconomics call structural unemployment, the presumed mismatch between the overall demand for labour in jobs offered and the individual job skills and location of labour. This differs from the Keynesian concept of cyclical unemployment, which is presumed to arise because of inadequate aggregate demand.

Such economic losses and unemployment were seen by some economists, such as Marx and Keynes himself, as an intrinsic property of the capitalist system. The division of labor leads to a situation where one always has to anticipate what others will be willing to buy, and this leads to miscalculations.

== Assumptions and criticisms ==

Say&#x27;s law did not posit that (as per the Keynesian formulation) &quot;supply creates its own demand&quot;. Nor was it based on the idea that everything that is saved will be exchanged. Rather, Say sought to refute the idea that production and employment were limited by low consumption.

Thus Say&#x27;s law, in its original concept, was not intrinsically linked nor logically reliant on the neutrality of money (as has been alleged by those who wish to disagree with it), because the key proposition of the law is that no matter how much people save, production is still a possibility, as it is the prerequisite for the attainment of any additional consumption goods. Say&#x27;s law states that in a market economy, goods and services are produced for exchange with other goods and services—&quot;employment multipliers&quot; therefore arise from production and not exchange alone—and that in the process a sufficient level of real income is created to purchase the economy&#x27;s entire output, due to the truism that the means of consumption are limited &quot;ex vi termini&quot; by the level of production. That is, with regard to the exchange of products within a division of labour, the total supply of goods and services in a market economy will equal the total demand derived from consumption during any given time period. In modern terms, &quot;general gluts cannot exist&quot;, although there may be local imbalances, with gluts in some markets balanced out by shortages in others.

Nevertheless, for some neoclassical economists, Say&#x27;s law implies that economy is always at its full employment level. This is not necessarily what Say proposed.

In the Keynesian interpretation, the assumptions of Say&#x27;s law are:
* a barter model of money (&quot;products are paid for with products&quot;);
* flexible prices—that is, all prices can rapidly adjust upwards or downwards; and
* no government intervention.

Under these assumptions, Say&#x27;s law implies that there cannot be a general glut, so that a persistent state cannot exist in which demand is generally less than productive capacity and high unemployment results. Keynesians therefore argued that the Great Depression demonstrated that Say&#x27;s law is incorrect. Keynes, in his &quot;General Theory&quot;, argued that a country could go into a recession because of &quot;lack of aggregate demand&quot;.

Because historically there have been many persistent economic crises, one may reject one or more of the assumptions of Say&#x27;s law, its reasoning, or its conclusions. Taking the assumptions in turn:

* Circuitists and some post-Keynesians dispute the barter model of money, arguing that money is fundamentally different from commodities and that credit bubbles can and do cause depressions. Notably, the debt owed does not change because the economy has changed.
* Keynes argued that prices are not flexible; for example, workers may not take pay cuts if the result is starvation.
* Laissez-faire economists argue that government intervention is the cause of economic crises, and that left to its devices, the market will adjust efficiently.

As for the implication that dislocations cannot cause persistent unemployment, some theories of economic cycles accept Say&#x27;s law and seek to explain high unemployment in other ways, considering depressed demand for labour as a form of local dislocation. For example, advocates of Real Business Cycle Theory argue that real shocks cause recessions and that the market responds efficiently to these real economic shocks.

Krugman dismisses Say&#x27;s law as, &quot;at best, a useless tautology when individuals have the option of accumulating money rather than purchasing real goods and services&quot;.

=== Role of money ===

It is not easy to say what exactly Say&#x27;s law says about the role of money apart from the claim that recession is not caused by lack of money. The phrase &quot;products are paid for with products&quot; is taken to mean that Say has a barter model of money; contrast with circuitist and post-Keynesian monetary theory.

One can read Say as stating simply that money is completely neutral, although he did not state this explicitly, and in fact did not concern himself with this subject. Say&#x27;s central notion concerning money was that if one has money, it is &quot;irrational&quot; to hoard it.

The assumption that hoarding is irrational was attacked by underconsumptionist economists, such as John M. Robertson, in his 1892 book, &quot;The Fallacy of Saving&quot;: where he called Say&#x27;s law:

Here Robertson identifies his critique as based on Say&#x27;s theory of money: people wish to accumulate a &quot;claim to future wealth&quot;, not simply present goods, and thus the hoarding of wealth may be rational.

For Say, as for other classical economists, it is possible for there to be a glut (excess supply, market surplus) for one product alongside a shortage (excess demand) of others. But there is no &quot;general glut&quot; in Say&#x27;s view, since the gluts and shortages cancel out for the economy as a whole. But what if the excess demand is for &quot;money&quot;, because people are hoarding it? This creates an excess supply for all products, a general glut. Say&#x27;s answer is simple: there is no reason to engage in hoarding money. According to Say, the only reason to have money is to buy products. It would not be a mistake, in his view, to treat the economy &quot;as if&quot; it were a barter economy. To quote Say:

Nor is [an individual] less anxious to dispose of the money he may get ... But the only way of getting rid of money is in the purchase of some product or other.

In Keynesian terms, followers of Say&#x27;s law would argue that on the aggregate level, there is only a transactions demand for money. That is, there is no precautionary, finance, or speculative demand for money. Money is held for spending, and increases in money supplies lead to increased spending.

Some classical economists did see that a loss of confidence in business or a collapse of credit will increase the demand for money, which will decrease the demand for goods. This view was expressed both by Robert Torrens and John Stuart Mill. This would lead demand and supply to move out of phase and lead to an economic downturn in the same way that miscalculation in productions would, as described by William H. Beveridge in 1909.

However, in classical economics, there was no reason for such a collapse to persist. In this view, persistent depressions, such as that of the 1930s, are impossible in a free market organized according to laissez-faire principles. The flexibility of markets under laissez faire allows prices, wages, and interest rates to adjust so as to abolish all excess supplies and demands; however, since all economies are a mixture of regulation and free-market elements, laissez-faire principles (which require a free market environment) cannot adjust effectively to excess supply and demand.

== As a theoretical point of departure ==
The whole of neoclassical equilibrium analysis implies that Say&#x27;s law in the first place functioned to bring a market into this state: that is, Say&#x27;s law is the mechanism through which markets equilibrate uniquely. Equilibrium analysis and its derivatives of optimization and efficiency in exchange live or die with Say&#x27;s law. This is one of the major, fundamental points of contention between the neoclassical tradition, Keynes, and Marxians. Ultimately, from Say&#x27;s law they deduced vastly different conclusions regarding the functioning of capitalist production.

The former, not to be confused with &quot;new Keynesian&quot; and the many offsprings and syntheses of the &quot;General Theory&quot;, take the fact that a commodity–commodity economy is substantially altered once it becomes a commodity–money–commodity economy, or once money becomes not only a facilitator of exchange (its only function in marginalist theory) but also a store of value and a means of payment. What this means is that money can be (and must be) hoarded: it may not re-enter the circulatory process for some time, and thus a general glut is not only possible but, to the extent that money is not rapidly turned over, probable.

A response to this in defense of Say&#x27;s law (echoing the debates between Ricardo and Malthus, in which the former denied the possibility of a general glut on its grounds) is that consumption that is abstained from through hoarding is simply transferred to a different consumer—overwhelmingly to factor (investment) markets, which, through financial institutions, function through the rate of interest.

Keynes&#x27; innovation in this regard was twofold: First, he was to turn the mechanism that regulates savings and investment, the rate of interest, into a shell of its former self (relegating it to the &quot;price of money&quot;) by showing that supply and investment were not independent of one another and thus could not be related uniquely in terms of the balancing of disutility and utility. Second, after Say&#x27;s law was dealt with and shown to be theoretically inconsistent, there was a gap to be filled. If Say&#x27;s law was the logic by which we thought financial markets came to a unique position in the long run, and if Say&#x27;s law were to be discarded, what were the real &quot;rules of the game&quot; of the financial markets? How did they function and remain stable?

To this Keynes responded with his famous notion of &quot;animal spirits&quot;: markets are ruled by speculative behavior, influenced not only by one&#x27;s own personal equation but also by one&#x27;s perceptions of the speculative behavior of others. In turn, others&#x27; behavior is motivated by their perceptions of others&#x27; behavior, and so on. Without Say&#x27;s law keeping them in balance, financial markets are thus inherently unstable. Through this identification, Keynes deduced the consequences for the macroeconomy of long-run equilibrium being attained not at only one unique position that represented a &quot;Pareto Optima&quot; (a special case), but through a possible range of many equilibria that could significantly under-employ human and natural resources (the general case).

For the Marxian critique, which is more fundamental, one must start at Marx&#x27;s initial distinction between use value and exchange value—use value being the use somebody has for a commodity, and exchange value being what an item is traded for on a market. In Marx&#x27;s theory, there is a gap between the creation of surplus value in production and the realization of that surplus value via a sale. To realize a sale, a commodity must have a use value for someone, so that they purchase the commodity and complete the cycle &quot;M–C–M&#x27;&quot;. Capitalism, which is interested in value (money as wealth), must create use value. The capitalist has no control over whether or not the value contained in the product is realized through the market mechanism. This gap between production and realization creates the possibility for capitalist crisis, but only if the value of any item is realised through the difference between its cost and final price. As the realization of capital is only possible through a market, Marx criticized other economists, such as David Ricardo, who argued that capital is realized via production. Thus, in Marx&#x27;s theory, there can be &quot;general&quot; overproductive crises within capitalism.

Given these concepts and their implications, Say&#x27;s law does not hold in the Marxian framework. Moreover, the theoretical core of the Marxian framework contrasts with that of the neoclassical and Austrian traditions.

Conceptually, the distinction between Keynes and Marx is that for Keynes the theory is but a special case of his general theory, whereas for Marx it never existed at all.

== Modern interpretations ==
A modern way of expressing Say&#x27;s law is that there can never be a general glut. Instead of there being an excess supply (glut or surplus) of goods in general, there may be an excess supply of one or more goods, but only when balanced by an excess demand (shortage) of yet other goods. Thus, there may be a glut of labor (&quot;cyclical&quot; unemployment), but this is balanced by an excess demand for produced goods. Modern advocates of Say&#x27;s law see market forces as working quickly, via price adjustments, to abolish both gluts and shortages. The exception is when governments or other non-market forces prevent price adjustments.

According to Keynes, the implication of Say&#x27;s law is that a free-market economy is always at what Keynesian economists call full employment (see also Walras&#x27; law). Thus, Say&#x27;s law is part of the general world view of laissez-faire economics—that is, that free markets can solve the economy&#x27;s problems automatically. (These problems are recessions, stagnation, depression, and involuntary unemployment.)

Some proponents of Say&#x27;s law argue that such intervention is always counterproductive. Consider Keynesian-type policies aimed at stimulating the economy. Increased government purchases of goods (or lowered taxes) merely &quot;crowd out&quot; the production and purchase of goods by the private sector. Contradicting this view, Arthur Cecil Pigou, a self-proclaimed follower of Say&#x27;s law, wrote a letter in 1932 signed by five other economists (among them Keynes) calling for more public spending to alleviate high levels of unemployment.

=== Keynes versus Say ===

Keynes summarized Say&#x27;s law as &quot;supply creates its own demand&quot;, or the assumption &quot;that the whole of the costs of production must necessarily be spent in the aggregate, directly or indirectly, on purchasing the product&quot; (from chapter 2 of his &quot;General Theory&quot;). See the article on The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money for a summary of Keynes&#x27;s view.

Although hoarding of money was not a direct cause of unemployment in Keynes&#x27;s theory, his concept of saving was unclear and some readers have filled the gap by assigning to hoarding the role Keynes gave to saving. An early example was Jacob Viner, who in his 1936 review of the &quot;General Theory&quot; said of hoarding that Keynes&#x27; attaches great importance to it as a barrier to &quot;full&quot; employment&#x27; (p152) while denying (pp158f) that it was capable of having that effect.

The theory that hoarding is a cause of unemployment has been the subject of discussion. Some classical economists suggested that hoarding (increases in money-equivalent holdings) would always be balanced by dis-hoarding. This requires equality of saving (abstention from purchase of goods) and investment (the purchase of capital goods). However, Keynes and others argued that hoarding decisions are made by different people and for different reasons than are decisions to dis-hoard, so that hoarding and dis-hoarding are unlikely to be equal at all times, as indeed they are not. Decreasing demand (consumption) does not necessarily stimulate capital spending (investment).

Some have argued that financial markets, and especially interest rates, could adjust to keep hoarding and dis-hoarding equal, so that Say&#x27;s law could be maintained, or that prices could simply fall, to prevent a decrease in production. But Keynes argued that to play this role, interest rates would have to fall rapidly, and that there are limits on how quickly and how low they can fall (as in the liquidity trap, where interest rates approach zero and cannot fall further). To Keynes, in the short run, interest rates are determined more by the supply and demand for money than by saving and investment. Before interest rates can adjust sufficiently, excessive hoarding causes the vicious circle of falling aggregate production (recession). The recession itself lowers incomes so that hoarding (and saving) and dis-hoarding (and real investment) can reach a state of balance below full employment.

Worse, a recession would hurt private real investment—by hurting profitability and business confidence—through what is called the accelerator effect. This means that the balance between hoarding and dis-hoarding would be pushed even further below the full-employment level of production.

Keynes treats a fall in marginal efficiency of capital and an increase in the degree of liquidity preference (demand for money) as sparks leading to an insufficiency of effective demand. A decrease in MEC causes a reduction in investment, which reduces aggregate expenditure and income. A decline in the interest rate would offset the decline in investment, and stimulate propensity to consume.

<text>The Central Bank of Ireland () is the Irish member of the Eurosystem and had been the monetary authority for Ireland from 1943 to 1998, issuing the Irish pound. It is also the country&#x27;s main financial regulatory authority, and since 2014 has been Ireland&#x27;s national competent authority within European Banking Supervision.

The Central Bank of Ireland was founded on 1 February 1943, and since 1 January 1972 has been the banker of the Government of Ireland in accordance with the Central Bank Act 1971, which can be seen in legislative terms as completing the long transition from a currency board to a fully functional central bank.

Its head office, the Central Bank of Ireland building, was located on Dame Street, Dublin from 1979 until 2017. Its offices at Iveagh Court and College Green also closed down at the same time. Since March 2017, its headquarters are located on North Wall Quay, where the public may exchange non-current Irish coinage and currency (both pre- and post-decimalization) for Euros, as well as high value Euro banknotes and &quot;mutilated&quot; currency. It also operates from premises at nearby Spencer Dock. The Currency Centre (Irish Mint) at Sandyford is the currency manufacture, warehouse and distribution site of the bank.

==History==

===From Currency Commission to Central Bank (1920–1942)===

On the independence of the Irish Free State in 1922, the new state&#x27;s trade was overwhelmingly with the United Kingdom (98% of Irish exports and 80% of imports in 1924), so the introduction of an independent currency was a low priority. British banknotes (British Treasury notes, Bank of England notes), and notes issued by Irish trading banks circulated (but only the first were legal tender) and British coins remained in circulation.

Under the terms of the &quot;Coinage Act 1926&quot;, the Finance Minister was authorised to issue coins of silver, nickel, and bronze of the same denominations as the British coins already in circulation – however, the Irish silver coins were to contain 75% silver as compared to the 50% silver coins issued by Britain at the time. These coins entered circulation on 12 December 1928.

Under the terms of the &quot;Currency Act 1927&quot;, a new unit of currency, the &quot;Saorstát Pound&quot; &quot;(Free State Pound)&quot; was created, which was to be maintained at parity with the British Pound Sterling by a Currency Commission which would keep British government securities, Pounds Sterling cash, and gold to keep a 1–1 relationship.

From 1928 to 1979, the UK and Ireland were in a currency union.

===Foundation of the Central Bank to decimalisation (1942–1971) ===

The &quot;Central Bank Act 1942&quot; which came into effect on 1 February 1943 renamed the Currency Commission the &quot;Central Bank of Ireland&quot;, although the organisation did not at that time acquire many of the characteristics of a central bank:

* it was not given custody of the cash reserves of the commercial banks
* it had no statutory power to restrict credit, though it could promote it
* the Bank of Ireland remained the government&#x27;s banker
* the conditions for influencing credit through open-market operations did not yet exist
* Ireland&#x27;s external monetary reserves were largely held as external assets of the commercial banks

The mid-1960s saw the Bank take over the normal day-to-day operations of exchange control from the Department of Finance. The Central Bank broadened its activities over the decades, but it remained in effect a currency board until the 1970s. Economist Patrick Honohan evaluates the success of the movement from a currency board to the central bank as follows: &#x27;in contrast to many other post-colonial cases, (the currency board&#x27;s) demise was not followed by a rapid depreciation and slide into semi-permanent high inflation and lack of convertibility.

Such was the proliferation of small industrial banks and hire purchase firms in the late 1960s, the 1971 Central Bank Act introduced significantly enhanced authorisation and supervision standards. In the inevitable consolidation in the marketplace, in 1976 a liquidator was appointed to Irish Trust Bank Ltd after Central Bank investigations and in 1982 Merchant Banking Ltd also collapsed.

===Decimalisation to European integration (1971–1978)===

The 1970s was a decade of change, which began with the decimalisation of the currency which came into effect on 15 February 1971, when the decimal coinage was released into circulation (although 5p, 10p, and 50p coins were released a few years earlier, as they had exact equivalents in old currency units). Decimalisation would have provided an ideal opportunity to break the link with the Pound Sterling, but there was not much demand for this at that time. In 1972 however, the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates broke down, and in the wake of the 1973 oil crisis inflation in Britain increased dramatically, and economic theory would suggest that a smaller economy whose currency is pegged to a larger one will suffer the larger economy&#x27;s inflation rate. At the same time moves to create a money market in Dublin and the transfer in 1968 of the commercial banks&#x27; Pound Sterling assets to the Central Bank made it possible to contemplate a break in the link. In the mid to late 1970s, opinion within the bank was moving toward breaking the link with the Pound Sterling and devaluing the Irish currency in order to limit inflationary effects from abroad.

===The EMS and movement toward a single currency===
At this time, however, an alternative option became available. In April 1978, the European Council meeting in Copenhagen decided to create a &quot;zone of monetary stability&quot; in Europe, and European Economic Community institutions were invited to consider how to create such a zone. At the following Council meeting in Bremen, Germany in June 1978 the basic features of the European Monetary System were outlined, including the creation of the ECU – &quot;European Currency Unit&quot;, a basket of the Community&#x27;s currencies used to determine exchange rates, and the forerunner of the Euro.

The Irish government had to decide whether or not to participate in the EMS. If the EMS had included all the European Economic Community&#x27;s currencies, it would have provided stability for 75% of Ireland&#x27;s external trade, but Britain, which still accounted for 50% of Ireland&#x27;s external trade, decided to stay out of the EMS. Despite this, on 15 December 1978, it was announced that Ireland would participate in the EMS. Countries were given the option of either a 2.25% or 6% margin of fluctuation within the EMS&#x27; Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), and Ireland took the narrower margin. The EMS started on 13 March 1979, and towards the end of the month the Pound Sterling started to gain in value against the EMS currencies because of rising oil prices, and by 30 March the Pound Sterling breached the upper fluctuation band limit of the Belgian franc and the Irish currency could no longer track the Pound Sterling. After over 50 years, the parity of the Irish and British currencies was broken, and the Irish currency became known as the Irish pound (or Punt in the Irish language).

The initial experience of the EMS was disappointing. It had been expected that the Irish Pound would appreciate in value against the Pound Sterling, and hence reduce inflation in Ireland, but in practice, Sterling appreciated considerably in value thanks to its status as a petrocurrency and to the tight monetary policies of the new British government of Margaret Thatcher. By late 1980 the Irish Pound had fallen in value to less than 80 British pence, and Irish inflation was higher than British. Economic policy in Ireland was inconsistent with a &quot;hard currency&quot; policy, and the Irish Pound also failed to hold its value against the central rate of the Deutschmark, although it did appreciate in value against some of the other EMS currencies.

Eventually, the EMS settled down (notwithstanding a crisis in 1992 when the Irish Pound was devalued by 10%), and Irish inflation was the same or lower than Britain&#x27;s inflation rate from 1987 onwards.

===Towards the Euro===

The idea of a single European currency goes back to the Schumann Plan of 1950. The first blueprint for how to go about implementing the currency, the Werner Report of 1970 was not proceeded with, but the ultimate aim was always kept in mind. The &quot;Delors Report&quot; endorsed by the Madrid Summit of June 1989 envisaged a three-stage process to monetary union, and this was given legal authority by the Maastricht Treaty of 1992 (enacted into Irish law as the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution of Ireland by 70% of those voting in a referendum on 18 June 1992). This envisaged the start of monetary union on 1 January 1999 and the introduction of notes and coins on 1 January 2002.

The Central Bank began production of euro coins in September 1999 in the Currency Centre (Irish Mint) in Sandyford, producing over a billion coins, weighing about 5,000 tons, with a value of €230 million before the introduction into circulation of the euro coins in January 2002. Production of euro banknotes began in June 2000, with 300 million notes worth €4 billion being produced in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 euros. Euro banknotes produced for the Central Bank are identified by having the serial number beginning with the letter T. The Bank did not initially issue €200 or €500 notes but has since begun to do so.

===Domestic banking crisis===

The Central Bank noted in November 2005 that an overvaluation existed of 40% to 60% in the Irish residential property market. Minutes of a meeting with the OECD indicated that while the Central Bank agreed that Irish property was overvalued it was fearful of precipitating a crash by &quot;putting a number on it&quot;. Senior Allied Irish Bank officials expressed concerns in 2006 that Central Bank stress tests were &quot;not stressful enough&quot;. The management ignored warnings from its own financial stability unit, according to one former staff member, whose evidence to the parliamentary inquiry was questioned by a number of other staff members, and from the Economic and Social Research Institute about the scale of bank loans to property speculators and developers leading to key information being suppressed. It was reported that it sought to gag a prominent economist from talking about the fragile state of the nation&#x27;s banks in relation the Irish branch of Northern Rock. The Central Bank &quot;watered down&quot; economic warnings about the property bubble in the run-up to the crash, blocked internal communication reaching board level due to the political interests, and &quot;rigorously&quot; concealed data from the relevant external supervisors on the large exposures of Irish banks to individual developers.

In November 2007, they stated: &quot;The Irish banking system continues to be well-placed to withstand adverse economic and sectoral developments in the short to medium term. The underlying fundamentals of the residential market continue to appear strong and the current trend in monthly price developments does not imply a sharp correction. The central scenario, therefore, is for a soft landing.&quot;

After the bubble burst, Irish banks faced mounting losses which exposed them to a collapse of confidence following the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in September 2008; they then suffered acute liquidity pressures which had to be met by Central Bank support, including emergency lending. Management abuses were also revealed at Anglo Irish Bank, which had to be nationalised in January 2009.

The Central Bank annual report, published three months before the Irish State unconditionally guaranteed the deposits of Irish-owned banks, said: &quot;The banks have negligible exposure to the sub-prime sector and they remain relatively healthy by the standard measures of capital, profitability and asset quality. This has been confirmed by the stress testing exercises we have carried out with the banks&quot;.

The next annual report had little to say about how and why the Irish banking system collapsed. Although there were four Central Bank directors on the board of the Financial Regulator, the Central Bank maintained it had no powers to intervene in the market. Yet, the Central Bank had the power to issue directives to the Financial Regulator if it thought it was conducting its business in a way that was contrary to overall Central Bank policy aims. None were issued.

The regulator&#x27;s processes and reports, and the findings of external scrutineers, any of which should have raised red flags, failed to do so. As a result, they did not see the enormity of the risks being taken by the banks and the calamity that was to overwhelm them.

The European Commission in a November 2010 review of the financial crisis said: &quot;Some national supervisory authorities failed dramatically. We know that in Ireland there was almost no supervision of the large banks.&quot; Two months later, the President of the EU Commission in an angry exchange in the European Parliament, with a vehemence that shocked his audience, said that &quot;the problems of Ireland were created by the irresponsible financial behaviour of some Irish institutions, and by the lack of supervision in the Irish market.&quot;

===Separation of regulation – The Financial Regulator===

In 2003 a new separate division of the Central Bank, with its own chairman, chief executive, and board, was established as the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority. This was a compromise between those who favoured a fully independent regulator and those who believed the Central Bank should maintain full control of regulation of the financial services industry. This division of the Bank authorised and regulated all financial institutions (including insurance undertakings, collective investment funds and credit unions) in Ireland. The &quot;Central Bank of Ireland&quot; was formally renamed Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (CBFSAI). (There was no entity named &quot;Financial Services Authority of Ireland&quot;.)

Under the 2003 arrangements, the Central Bank provided the Financial Regulator with services. The Regulator&#x27;s industry panel, which provided the Regulator with feedback on its charges and policies said in April 2007 that they had &quot;major concerns with the quality and cost of the services&quot; provided to the Regulator by the Central Bank.

The operations of the Financial Regulator were severely criticised in a report marked &quot;strictly confidential and not for publication&quot;, as being poor value for money. The report stated that there were too few specialist staff, compared with its peers. There were also serious shortcomings in the crucial supervisory area. and the report was particularly critical of the regulator&#x27;s senior management structure, concluding that a clear management and oversight framework, which ensures that issues are escalated through the organisation, was &quot;not fully in place&quot;.

Former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern, said that his decision in 2001 to create a new financial regulator was one of the main reasons for the collapse of the Irish banking sector and &quot;if I had a chance again I wouldn&#x27;t do it&quot;. Ahern said: &quot;The banks were irresponsible. But the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator seemed happy. They were never into us saying – ever – &#x27;Listen, we must put legislation and control on the banks&#x27;. That never happened.&quot;

In April 2010, the new Financial Regulator, outlined his shock at the poor level of financial regulation he discovered when he started his job the previous January and &quot;it is clear to me we need to undertake a fundamental overhaul of the regulatory model for financial services in Ireland.&quot; He also said that there was a &quot;critical absence of intellectual firepower within his staff&quot;.

Following the banking collapse of 2008 and 2009, the Government re-unified the organisation under a Central Bank of Ireland Commission to replace the board structures of the Central Bank and the Financial Services Regulatory Authority which became effective on 1 October 2010. The name &quot;Central Bank of Ireland&quot; was restored. A July 2009 editorial in the &quot;Sunday Business Post&quot; said &quot;returning the key powers of regulation to the Central Bank will be useless unless there is a fundamental change in the culture of the organisation. This does not require a complete change of personnel, but a change of key personnel.&quot; There can be no denying that the spinning off of the Financial Regulator from the functions of the Central Bank in 2003, was an outright failure.

===Post crisis reforms===

On 4 November 2014 the European Central Bank formally took supervisory control over the biggest banks in Europe, including those in Ireland. While banking supervision staff in the Central Bank of Ireland remained, a pan-European approach to how banks were supervised was introduced, known as European Banking Supervision.

Subsequent to the parliamentary inquiry into the domestic banking crisis the organization said that the actions taken by the Central Bank combined with legislative reform and an overhaul of international regulation have enabled the organization to deliver effective supervision and financial stability measures since the crisis. Governor Philip Lane said, &quot;The report describes a failure to identify risks to financial stability and recognizes the lack of an overall European framework to deal with the financial and fiscal crises. Many of the issues identified by the Inquiry relating to the Central Bank have been substantially addressed or continue to be addressed through measures including significant institutional reform, additional powers, the promotion of a culture of challenge and the implementation of the model of assertive risk-based supervision underpinned by a credible threat of enforcement.&quot;

In early 2015 the Central Bank introduced macro-prudential mortgage regulations to increase the resilience of the banking and household sectors to the property market and to reduce the risk of bank credit and house price spirals from developing in the future. These measures are to be reviewed annually, with the first report published in November 2016.

In response to the July 2016 leprechaun economics affair, on the request of the Central Statistics Office (&quot;CSO&quot;), the Governor of the Central Bank chaired a cross economic steering group (Economic Statistics Review Group, or &quot;ESRG&quot;) including the IFAC, ESRI, NTMA, leading academics and the Department of Finance, to recommend new economic statistics to the CSO, that would better represent the Irish economy (given the escalating distortions in GDP and GNP). The result was the introduction of &quot;modified GNI&quot; (or GNI*). Report Site of the ESRG. 2016 Modified GNI* is 70% of 2016 GDP (or 2016 GDP is 143% of 2016 GNI*).

===Historical archives and data===

The Central Bank opened its archives to the public in 2017 operating a 30 year rule for the release of records. The archives can be accessed by means of the Banks online finding aid and consulted in the Bank&#x27;s North Wall Quay premises in Dublin.

The bank releases data on the changing wealth of Irish households.

==Responsibilities==

The Central Bank of Ireland&#x27;s mandate calls on it to contribute to the well-being of the people of Ireland and more widely in Europe by performing statutory responsibilities which cover a wide range, including :
* price stability;
* financial stability;
* consumer protection;
* supervision and enforcement;
* regulatory policy development;
* payment, settlement and currency systems operations and oversight;
* the provision of economic advice and financial statistics; and
* the recovery and resolution of distressed financial services firms.

==Governors==

The Governor of the Bank is appointed by the President of Ireland on the constitutional advice of the Government of Ireland.

==Criticisms==

Recurrent criticisms were made both before and after the Irish banking crisis, of the Central Bank of Ireland. As seen in the Irish banking crisis, when global markets are stressed, several of these issues can occur simultaneously (i.e. they are not independent risks), to amplify the seriousness of the situation. While the pre-crisis Central Bank of Ireland was judged to fail on all these criticisms, the Irish State had the financial resources to bail out the Irish banking system (Ireland was almost debt-free before the crisis). Post the 2011–bailout, the Irish State has a debt-to-GNI* ratio of over 100%, and will not be able to withstand such a material failing by the Central Bank of Ireland again. A recurrence would place the Irish banking system, and the Irish State, into creditor restructuring.

===Green jersey agenda===

In 2016, several Irish bank CEOs testified to being asked by senior officials of the Central Bank during 2007–2011 to follow a &quot;green jersey agenda&quot; in obfuscating the facts of Ireland&#x27;s deteriorating banking system. After the 2011–bailout by the EU–ECB–IMF (e.g. the European troika) of the Irish banking system, a number of non–Irish senior executives were placed in the Central Bank of Ireland, including the Board of the Bank. However, by 2017, almost all these non–Irish executives had departed the Central Bank, and some have publicised concerns about the Central Bank&#x27;s tendency to push aside risk-management in pursuit of political and Government objectives.

===Mortgage controls post crisis===

The Irish Celtic Tiger era was typified by large, interest-only mortgages, at high levels of loan-to-income values. After the 2011 bailout, the Central Bank introduced macro–prudential controls on mortgage lending both in terms of loan-to-value (a cap of 80% and 90% depending on circumstances), and loan-to-income (a cap of 3.5 times income). A limited number of exemptions to these are available to Irish banks for both of these rules on an annual basis. Additionally, the Irish Government introduced a Help To Buy scheme, which allows first-time buyers to receive 5% of the cost price of a house as an income tax rebate – which loosened the LTI requirements further for eligible first-time buyers. The Irish financial crisis showed the small and unusual nature of Ireland&#x27;s economy (e.g. where a small number of U.S. corporates are 80% of Irish tax, 25% of Irish labour, 25 of top 50 Irish firms, and 57% of Irish value-add), led to foreign banks rapidly withdrawing capital from Ireland in times of stress.

===Light-touch regulation===

In 2017, it was shown that brochures of IFSC services firms market Ireland as a &quot;light-touch&quot; regulatory regime. The Central Bank itself was paying rent to a US distressed debt-landlord who was using a Central Bank-regulated ICAV structure to avoid all Irish taxes. In February 2018, the Central Bank expanded the little-used L–QIAIF vehicle to give the tax benefits as Section 110 SPVs but without requiring public accounts for the Irish CRO, which was how the abuses above were uncovered. In June 2018, the Central Bank reported that distressed debt funds switched €55 billion, or 25% of Irish GNI*, out of Section 110 SPVs, and presumably into L–QIAIFs. Such actions have been highlighted as those of a &quot;captured state&quot; by tax-experts.

===Distorted economic data===

Research in June 2018 confirmed that Ireland, already a &quot;major tax haven&quot;, was the world&#x27;s largest tax haven. In common with all tax havens, Ireland&#x27;s economic data is distorted by the BEPS flows from tax management activities. The top–10 GDP-per-capita countries, excluding natural resource countries, are all tax havens (see GDP-per-capita and tax havens). This was shown dramatically in July 2016 during &quot;leprechaun economics&quot; affair when Apple re-structured its Double Irish BEPS tool, as agreed under an ongoing EU tax-investigation into Apple in Ireland, into a new Irish CAIA arrangement BEPS tool.

Exaggerated credit cycles are a documented feature of tax havens as global capital markets misprice the &quot;headline&quot; debt-to-GDP in benign times, only to reprice aggressively in less benign times, leading to a credit crisis (discussed in tax haven credit cycles). In 2017, the Central Bank of Ireland responded to this issue, post-leprehaun economics, by introducing Modified gross national income (or GNI*), as a more appropriate measure for Ireland&#x27;s economy.

The issues post-leprechaun economics, and &quot;Modified GNI&quot;, are captured on page 34 of the OECD 2018 Ireland survey:
===Commercial property bubbles===

Ireland&#x27;s status as a &quot;major tax haven&quot;, and its exposure to a handful of major U.S. multinationals, mean that its commercial property market is prone to overinflating. This effect is amplified because the Irish State enables foreign investors to pay no taxes on Irish commercial property via the Central Bank regulated QIAIFs (and ICAVs in particular). The ratio of the value of prime office in Dublin, to its cost-of-build, is the second-largest in the Eurozone, and only exceeded by Paris. Irish office rents are close to London City office rents.

Irish banks are the main lending institutions to Irish commercial property, and thus most exposed to material price distortions. As was seen in the Irish banking crisis, when global conditions weaken and the demand for Irish office space falls, the drop in Irish commercial valuations is more extreme than other markets. When this occurs in-sync with a global repricing of Irish credit, from a realisation of the level of artificial distortion in Irish economic data, the effects are further amplified. This risk was highlighted in 2014 when the Central Bank consulted the European Systemic Risk Board (&quot;ESRB&quot;) after lobbying by IFSC tax-law firms to expand the L–QIAIF vehicle. While the Central Bank agreed with the ESRB in 2014, it changed its mind in 2018, and decided to materially expand the L–QIAIFs vehicle (see ).

The longer-term risks of Irish commercial property were further increased with the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which fundamentally reduces the attractiveness of Ireland to U.S. multinationals, and could see Ireland lose its status as the major U.S. corporate tax haven.

===Control of total credit===

Irish and the tendency to commercial and residential property bubbles has led to periods when Ireland&#x27;s economy was over-leveraged and reliant on foreign capital. The ability of foreign capital to use Ireland&#x27;s tax haven tools (IP–based BEPS tools, and Debt–based BEPS tools) to avoid Irish taxes, attracts further non-domestic credit. It has been shown that smaller countries with a high proportion of non–domestic capital are prone to severe credit cycles. To resolve this imbalance in the 2007–2012 Irish financial crisis, Irish private-sector debt was transferred to Irish public-sector debt. The result is that Ireland is now one of the EU–28&#x27;s most leveraged countries on a private and public sector basis (when measured GNI or per-Capita measures, to limit the distortion by Irish GDP). This means that the Irish State will not be able to bail out its banking system again for a considerable time.

During the 2008–2012 global credit crisis, reports showed Ireland&#x27;s combined public and private sector credit as being the highest in the OECD (some reports added in IFSC SPV credit producing higher, but misleading, figures). In this regard, the Central Bank now tracks private and public credit in Ireland in its quarterly bulletins. Private credit is tracked on a credit-to-income ratio, while public sector credit is tracked on a debt-to-GNI* ratio. In addition, as part of the post-crisis reforms, the independent statutory body, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, also reports on Irish leverage (public and private) and its sustainability. It is still common to see other State bodies (e.g. NTMA and IDA Ireland) present the distorted, and misleading, Debt-to-GDP data in their reports.

<text>Sir Paul Meernaa Caedwalla Hasluck (1 April 1905 – 9 January 1993) was an Australian statesman who served as the 17th Governor-General of Australia, in office from 1969 to 1974. Prior to that, he was a Liberal Party politician, holding ministerial office continuously from 1951 to 1969.

Hasluck was born in Fremantle, Western Australia, and attended Perth Modern School and the University of Western Australia. After graduation he joined the university as a faculty member, eventually becoming a reader in history. Hasluck joined the Department of External Affairs during World War II, and served as Australia&#x27;s first Permanent Representative to the United Nations from 1946 to 1947. He would later contribute two volumes to &quot;Australia in the War of 1939–1945&quot;, the official history of Australia&#x27;s involvement in the war.

In 1949, Hasluck was elected to federal parliament for the Liberal Party, winning the Division of Curtin. In 1951, less than two years after entering politics, he was made Minister for Territories in the Menzies Government. In his twelve years in the position, he initiated transitions toward self-government in Australia&#x27;s territories, including Nauru, Papua New Guinea, and the Northern Territory. Hasluck later served as Minister for Defence (1963–1964) and Minister for External Affairs (1964–1969). His tenure in those positions covered Australia&#x27;s involvement in the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation and the first years of the Vietnam War.

After the disappearance of Harold Holt, Hasluck unsuccessfully stood in the resulting Liberal leadership election. He initially stayed on in cabinet under the new prime minister, John Gorton, but in 1969 Gorton instead nominated him to replace Lord Casey as governor-general. In his five years in the position, Hasluck saw two previous political adversaries (William McMahon and Gough Whitlam) become prime minister; he maintained good working relationships with both. In retirement, he was a prolific author, publishing an autobiography, several volumes of poetry, and multiple works on Australian history.

==Early life==
Hasluck was born on 1 April 1905 in Fremantle, Western Australia, one of five children born to Patience Eliza (née Wooler) and E&#x27;thel Meernaa Caedwalla Hasluck. His father was born in England and arrived in Australia in 1876 as a small child. He obtained a position in the colonial postal service and was postmaster in Coolgardie and on the Great Southern Railway, but later resigned to work full-time for the Salvation Army. His mother was born in England and came to Western Australia to work as a domestic servant, also becoming a devout Salvationist where she met her future husband.

Hasluck grew up in relative poverty, with the family often in financial distress as his parents undertook full-time missionary work. He had a &quot;strict religious upbringing&quot; in line with the beliefs and tenets of the Salvation Army, but became estranged from the movement at a young age. As a small child Hasluck spent periods in North Fremantle and in locations around regional Western Australia, including York, Kalgoorlie and Collie. The family lived in Collie for four years, where Hasluck&#x27;s father ran a boys&#x27; home for child migrants, before moving back to Perth in 1916 where he ran the Aged Men&#x27;s Retreat at Guildford.

After a brief period at the Guildford State School, Hasluck won a scholarship to Perth Modern School, which he attended between 1918 and 1922. He was president of the school debating society but later recalled that he lacked in confidence and did not consider going on to further studies. He would eventually enrol in the University of Western Australia six years after leaving school, completing a diploma in journalism on a part-time basis in 1932 and graduating Bachelor of Arts in 1937.

==Journalism and academia==
In 1922, after leaving school, Hasluck joined the staff of &quot;The West Australian&quot; as a probationary cadet. He was offered a full-time position in 1925 and covered a wide range of areas, including court and police reporting, sporting events, finance and drama and politics. He was eventually placed in charge of the newspaper&#x27;s press gallery staff at Parliament House and wrote a weekly political column covering state politics. He cultivated a close relationship with the Perth Trades Hall and the union movement, developing a friendship with &quot;Westralian Worker&quot; editor and future prime minister John Curtin.

While at &quot;The West Australian&quot;, Hasluck also began to publish articles (in that journal and elsewhere) on the history of the state. After he had obtained his MA, he worked as a tutor in the UWA&#x27;s history department, and in 1939 he was promoted to a lectureship in history. By that time he had been married for seven years to Alexandra Darker (1908–1993), with whom he had two sons. Alexandra Hasluck became a distinguished writer and historian in her own right, and was the first woman to be appointed a Dame of the Order of Australia. Also in 1939, Hasluck established Freshwater Bay Press, through which he released his first book, &quot;Into the Desert&quot;. The advent of the Second World War, however, saw the publishing company go into hiatus. The Freshwater Bay Press was later revived by his son Nicholas, and among its subsequent publications it issued a second book of Paul Hasluck&#x27;s poetry, &quot;Dark Cottage&quot; in 1984.

In 1941 Hasluck was recruited to the staff of the Department of External Affairs (it acquired the name &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; only in 1970), and served on Australian delegations to several international conferences, including the San Francisco Conference which founded the United Nations. Here he came into close contact with the Minister for External Affairs in the Labor government, Dr H.V. Evatt, towards whom he conceived a permanent aversion, fully reciprocated by Evatt&#x27;s attitude to him.

After the war Hasluck returned to the University of Western Australia as a Reader in History, and was commissioned to write two volumes of &quot;Australia in the War of 1939–1945&quot;, a 22-volume official history of Australia&#x27;s involvement in World War II. These volumes were published as &quot;The Government and the People 1939–1941&quot; in 1951 and &quot;The Government and the People 1941–1945&quot; in 1970. This work was interrupted by his decision to enter politics, a decision motivated partly by his disapproval of Evatt&#x27;s foreign policy.

==Political career==

At the 1949 election Hasluck won Liberal preselection for the newly created Perth-area seat of Curtin. Although it was notionally a Labor seat, it was located in natural Liberal territory in Perth&#x27;s wealthy beachside suburbs, and Hasluck won it with a resounding swing of almost 14 percent as part of the Coalition&#x27;s large victory that year.

In 1951, Prime Minister, Robert Menzies appointed Hasluck as Minister for Territories, a post that he held for twelve years. It gave him responsibility for Australia&#x27;s colonial possession, Papua New Guinea, and also the Northern Territory, home to Australia&#x27;s largest population of Aboriginals. Although he shared the paternalistic views of the period about the treatment of the Papua New Guineans and followed an assimilationist policy for Aboriginals he carried out significant reforms in how both peoples were treated.

Hasluck was responsible for the drafting of the bill that became the &quot;Welfare Ordinance 1953&quot;, which superseded the previous legislation controlling the lives of Aboriginals in the Northern Territory, the &quot;Aboriginals Ordinance 1918&quot;. There was no explicit reference to race in the &quot;Welfare Ordinance&quot;, but it made Aboriginals wards of the state. Wards were defined as those who did not have the right to vote, which only applied to Aboriginals.

Michael Somare, who became Papua New Guinea&#x27;s first Prime Minister, said that his country had been able to enter self-government without fear of having to argue with an Ian Smith &quot;simply because of Paul Hasluck&quot;.

Hasluck was briefly Minister for Defence in 1963 and 1964, and then became Minister for External Affairs. He held the office during the height of Australia&#x27;s commitment to the Vietnam War of which he was a passionate supporter. He worked to strengthen Australia&#x27;s relationship with the United States and with anticommunist governments in South-East Asia and opposed Australian recognition of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

===Leadership candidate===

When Prime Minister Harold Holt disappeared in December 1967 and was presumed to have drowned, Hasluck was determined that Treasurer, William McMahon, of whom he had a very low opinion, should not become prime minister. Although he had no great ambitions for himself, Hasluck put his name forward mainly to provide an alternative to McMahon. In the event, McMahon did not stand, as the interim prime minister, John McEwen, had advised his Country Party would not serve in any government headed by McMahon. The choice was between Hasluck, John Gorton, Billy Snedden and Les Bury, but the last two were never considered serious contenders. Many Liberal MPs saw Hasluck as too old at 64, too conservative and insufficiently telegenic to compete with the Labor leader, Gough Whitlam. Accordingly, they chose the younger and more aggressive Gorton.

==Governor-General==

In early 1969, Gorton offered Hasluck the post of Governor-General, which he accepted. Reportedly, Gorton was uncomfortable having a potential leadership rival in Cabinet. Hasluck resigned from Parliament on 10 February 1969, being the first Western Australian member of the House of Representatives to resign. He was sworn in as Governor-General on 30 April 1969. That may have cost Hasluck a second opportunity to become prime minister. Gorton resigned in 1971, and the Liberals might well have turned to Hasluck instead of McMahon if he had still been available.

At the 1972 election, Whitlam defeated McMahon and became prime minister. That created a potentially-awkward situation since Whitlam and Hasluck had bitterly resented one another for years. In a celebrated incident in the House of Representatives in 1965, Whitlam had thrown a glass of water at Hasluck after Hasluck had said, &quot;You are one of the filthiest objects ever to come into this chamber&quot;. Nevertheless, Hasluck and Whitlam treated each other with complete civility, which soon became genuine mutual respect. They had no difficulties in their formal dealings. An indication of the change that had taken place occurred soon after Whitlam&#x27;s victory. Normal practice called for McMahon to stay on as caretaker prime minister until Labor could choose a full ministry at its first caucus meeting. However, Whitlam was unwilling to wait that long and asked Hasluck to have Whitlam and his deputy leader, Lance Barnard, sworn in as an interim two-man government once Labor&#x27;s victory was beyond doubt. Hasluck promptly agreed, and Whitlam and Barnard held 27 portfolios between them until the full Labor ministry was sworn in.

In 1973, Hasluck&#x27;s Official Secretary, Sir Murray Tyrrell, retired after a career during which he had served six governors-general over 26 years. He was succeeded by David Smith.

Hasluck granted Whitlam a double dissolution in April 1974 (with an election on 18 May) when the Liberal Opposition threatened to block the Budget bills in the Senate. Hasluck&#x27;s term as Governor-General was due to expire in July 1974. Whitlam had offered to extend his term, but Hasluck declined, citing his wife&#x27;s refusal to remain at Yarralumla longer than the originally-agreed five years.

Hasluck&#x27;s last official act as Governor-General was to open the 29th Parliament on 9 July 1974. Two days later, his successor, Sir John Kerr, was sworn in.

== Retirement and legacy ==
Hasluck retired to Perth, where he remained active in cultural and political affairs until his death in 1993. He was buried at Karrakatta Cemetery.

Historians of the period are certain that, if Hasluck had still been Governor-General in 1975, the constitutional crisis of that year would have ended differently. Hasluck himself implied this in his 1979 book, &quot;The Office of Governor-General&quot;, and also in the Queale Lecture. He was even more explicit in his 1985 interview with Clyde Cameron for the National Library of Australia&#x27;s Oral History series, which was not released until 2010. He said he doubted he would have discussed with anyone but Whitlam about the Senate&#x27;s 1975 refusal to approve Supply. He also argued that Kerr erred in taking advice from Malcolm Fraser prior to appointing him as prime minister. In Hasluck&#x27;s view, &quot;the function of the governor-general is not to be the honest broker in political situations&quot;.

After Hasluck&#x27;s death, his son Nicholas Hasluck published a selection of his father&#x27;s private journals and notebooks, under the title &quot;The Chance of Politics&quot;. This book contained a number of highly critical comments, both political and personal, about many of Paul Hasluck&#x27;s contemporaries. The publication of this material caused considerable offence to some people. Others saw the comments as useful historical information.

Set into the footpath along St Georges Terrace, Perth are 150 bronze tablets commemorating notable figures in Western Australia&#x27;s history, completed as part of WAY 1979. One of the tablets is devoted to Hasluck.

His heraldic banner as Knight Companion of the Garter, from St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, probably the only one in Australia, was hung in the south transept of St George&#x27;s Cathedral, Perth, in 1995. The Catherine wheels on the banner were taken from the Armorial Bearings granted to him by the College of Arms. The crest beneath the banner includes the seven-pointed Australian Commonwealth Star and a formalised representation of West Australian Xanthorrhoea.

==Honours==
Hasluck was appointed a Privy Counsellor in 1966. On 21 February 1969, as Governor-General-designate, he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG).

During his term as Governor-General, on 29 May 1970, Queen Elizabeth II appointed him a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO), an appointment within her personal gift.

Hasluck received the Commemorative Medal of the 2500th Anniversary of the founding of the Persian Empire on 14 October 1971.

On 24 April 1979, he was made a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter (KG).

The Federal Division of Hasluck is named jointly after Sir Paul and his wife Dame Alexandra Hasluck.

<text>Sébastien-Roch Nicolas, known in his adult life as Nicolas Chamfort and as Sébastien Nicolas de Chamfort (; 6 April 1741 – 13 April 1794), was a French writer, best known for his epigrams and aphorisms. He was secretary to Louis XVI&#x27;s sister, and of the Jacobin club.

==Biography==
There are two birth certificates for Chamfort. The first, from Saint-Genès parish in Clermont-Ferrand, the capital city of Auvergne, says he was born there on 6 April 1741, the son of a grocer with the surname of Nicolas, and that he was given the name &quot;Sébastien-Roch&quot;, so that his full name was Sébastien-Roch Nicolas. But a second birth certificate gives him the name &quot;Sébastien Roch&quot; and says he was born on 22 June, of &quot;unknown parents&quot;, and some scholars argue that he was not born but baptized on that day. Local tradition said that he was the love child of an aristocratic woman, Jacqueline de Montrodeix (née Cisternes de Vinzelles), and of a clergyman named Pierre Nicolas; and that he was then given for adoption to the grocer, who was a relative of the biological father.

At the age of nine he was sent to Paris to study as a scholarship student at the Collège des Grassins. He worked hard, although one of his most contemptuous epigrams reads: &quot;What I learned I no longer know; the little I still know, I guessed&quot; (&quot;&quot;Ce que j&#x27;ai appris je ne le sais plus; le peu que je sais encore, je l&#x27;ai deviné.&quot;) He was a brilliant though dreamy student. When the principal of the college promised him a stipend, he replied that he could not accept because he preferred honour to honours: &quot;J&#x27;aime l&#x27;honneur et non-les honneurs&quot;&quot;.

Upon graduation he assumed the name of Chamfort.
For some time he subsisted by teaching and hack writing. His good looks and ready wit brought him attention; but, though endowed with immense physical strength – Madame de Craon called him &quot;Hercules under the guise of Adonis&quot; (Hercule]] sous la figure d&#x27;Adonis) – he lived so hard that he was glad to have the opportunity for a rest cure in the town of Spa when the Belgian minister in Paris, M. van Eyck, invited him to accompany him to Germany in 1761. On his return to Paris, Chamfort produced a successful comedy, &quot;The Young Indian Girl&quot; (La Jeune Indienne, 1764), following it with a series of epistles in verse, essays and odes. However, his literary reputation was not established until 1769, when the Académie française awarded him a prize for his &quot;Eloge&quot; on Molière.

Until then, he lived from hand to mouth, mainly on the hospitality of people who gave him board and lodging in exchange for the pleasure of the conversation for which he was famous. Madame Helvétius entertained him at Sèvres for some years. In 1770, another comedy, &quot;Le Marchand de Smyrne&quot;, brought him further notice, and he seemed on the road to fame and fortune, when illness struck. A generous friend gave him a pension of 1200 livres, charged on the &quot;Mercure de France&quot;. Thus assisted, he was able to go to the baths of Contrexéville and to spend some time in the country, where he wrote an &quot;Eloge&quot; on La Fontaine which won the prize of the Academy of Marseilles in 1774.

In 1775, while taking the waters at Barges, he met the duchesse de Grammont, sister of Choiseul, through whose influence he was introduced at court. In 1776, his tragedy, &quot;Mustapha et Zeangir&quot;, was played at Fontainebleau before Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette. Subsequently, the king gave him a further pension of 1200 livres and his cousin, the Prince de Condé, made him his secretary. Disliking the constraints of court life, he became increasingly discontented, and after a year he resigned his post in the prince&#x27;s household and retired to Auteuil. There, comparing the authors of old with his contemporaries, he composed a famous &quot;mot&quot; that proclaims the superiority of the dead over the living as companions. He fell in love with and married a lady attached to the household of the duchesse du Maine; she was 48 years old, clever, amusing, and a woman of the world. They soon moved to Vaucouleurs, where she died within six months. Chamfort lived in Holland for a time with M. de Narbonne, then returned to Paris where he was elected in 1781 to the Académie française.

He was a member of the Masonic lodge Les Neuf Sœurs.

In 1784, through the influence of Calonne, he became secretary to the king&#x27;s sister, Madame Élisabeth, and in 1786 he received a pension of 2000 livres from the royal treasury. He was thus once more attached to the court, and made friends there despite his satirical attitude. He quit the court for good after an unfortunate and mysterious love affair, and was taken into the house of M. de Vaudreuil. Here, in 1783, he met Honoré Mirabeau, with whom he remained steadfast friends, whom he assisted with money and influence, and at least one of whose speeches he wrote.

The outbreak of the French Revolution profoundly changed Chamfort&#x27;s life. He threw himself into the republican movement, forgetting his old friends at court and devoting his small fortune to revolutionary propaganda. He became a street orator and was among the first to enter the Bastille when it was stormed. Until 3 August 1791 he was secretary of the Jacobin club. He worked for the &quot;Mercure de France&quot;, collaborated with Pierre-Louis Ginguené in the &quot;Feuille villageoise&quot;, and drew up for Talleyrand his &quot;Addresse au peuple français&quot;.

With the reign of Marat and Robespierre, he became critical of uncompromising Jacobinism, and with the fall of the Girondins his political life came to an end. But he could not restrain the tongue that had made him famous; he no more spared the Convention than he had spared the court. His notorious republicanism failed to excuse the sarcasms he lavished on the new order of things. Fingered by an assistant in the Bibliothèque Nationale, to a share in the direction of which he had been appointed by Jean Marie Roland, he was taken to the prison des Madelonnettes. Soon after his release, he was threatened again with arrest, but he decided that death was preferable to a repetition of the moral and physical restraint to which he had been subjected.

Unable to tolerate the prospect of being imprisoned once more, in September 1793 he locked himself into his office and shot himself in the face. The pistol malfunctioned and he did not die even though he shot off his nose and his right eye. He then repeatedly stabbed his neck with a razor, but failed to cut an artery. He finally used the razor to stab himself in the chest and to cut his own hocks, aiming at the veins. He dictated to those who came to arrest him the well-known declaration &quot;Moi, Sebastien-Roch Nicolas de Chamfort, déclare avoir voulu mourir en homme libre plutôt que d&#x27;être reconduit en esclave dans une maison d&#x27;arrêt&quot; (&quot;I, Sebastien-Roch Nicolas de Chamfort, hereby declare my wish to die a free man rather than to be brought (again) as a slave in a prison&quot;) which he signed in a firm hand. His butler found him unconscious in a pool of blood. From then until his death in Paris the following year, he suffered intensely and was attended to by a gendarme, whom he paid a crown a day.

To the Abbé Sieyès Chamfort had given fortune in the title of a pamphlet (&quot;Qu&#x27;est-ce que le Tiers-État ? Tout. Qu&#x27;a-t-il ? Rien&quot;), and Sieyès was likewise the person to whom he told his famous sarcastic &quot;bon mot&quot; &quot;Ah ! mon ami, je m&#x27;en vais enfin de ce monde, où il faut que le cœur se brise ou se bronze&quot; (And so I leave this world, where the heart must either break or turn to lead.) Thus the maker of constitutions followed the dead wit to the grave.

==Writings==
The writings of Chamfort include comedies, political articles, literary criticisms, portraits, letters, and verses. His &quot;Maximes et Pensées&quot;, highly praised by John Stuart Mill, are, after those of La Rochefoucauld, among the most brilliant and suggestive sayings of the modern era. His aphorisms, less systematic and psychologically less important than those of La Rochefoucauld, are as significant in their violence and iconoclastic spirit of the period of storm and preparation that gave them birth as the &quot;Réflexions&quot; in their exquisite restraint and elaborate subtlety are characteristic of the tranquil elegance of their epoch. Moreover, they have the advantage of richness of colour, picturesqueness of phrase, passion, and audacity. Sainte-Beuve compares them to well-minted coins that retain their value, and to keen arrows that &quot;arrivent brusquement et sifflent encore&quot;. Although situated at the exact opposite of the political spectrum (see French Revolution) the maxims of Antoine de Rivarol are among those that easily compare in acidity and brilliance.
