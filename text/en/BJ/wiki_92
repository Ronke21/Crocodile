<text>Adriano Celentano (; born 6 January 1938) is an Italian singer-songwriter, actor, showman, and filmmaker. He is dubbed &quot;Il Molleggiato&quot; (&#x27;the springy one&#x27;) because of his energetic dancing.

Celentano&#x27;s many albums frequently enjoyed both commercial and critical success. With around 150 million records sold worldwide, he is the second best-selling Italian musical artist. Often credited as the author of both the music and lyrics of his songs, according to his wife Claudia Mori, some were written in collaboration with others. Due to his prolific career, both in Italy and abroad, he is considered one of the pillars of Italian music.

Celentano is recognized for being particularly perceptive of changes in the music business and is credited for having introduced rock and roll to Italy. As an actor, Celentano has appeared in 39 films, mostly comedies.

==Early life==
Celentano was born on 6 January 1938 in Milan, Italy, at 14 Via Cristoforo Gluck, a street close to the Central Station and this address later became the subject of the famous song &quot;Il ragazzo della via Gluck&quot; (&#x27;The boy from Gluck Street&#x27;). His parents, Leontino Celentano and Giuditta Giuvia, were from Foggia, Apulia, and had moved north for work. His career as a singer started in 1959. Before his debut as an artist, he was working as a watchmaker.

==Career==

Heavily influenced by Elvis Presley and the 1950s rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll scene as well as by American actor Jerry Lewis, Celentano started playing in a rock and roll band with Giorgio Gaber and Enzo Jannacci. Along with Gaber and Jannacci, he was discovered by Jolly Records A&amp;R Executive Ezio Leoni, who signed him to his first recording contract and co-authored with Celentano some of his greatest early hits, including &quot;24.000 baci&quot;, &quot;Il tuo bacio è come un rock&quot;, and &quot;Si è spento il Sole&quot;. He first appeared on screen in &quot;Ragazzi del Juke-Box&quot;, a 1959 Italian musical film directed by Lucio Fulci with music by Ezio Leoni. In 1960, Federico Fellini cast him as a rock and roll singer in his film &quot;La dolce vita&quot; (1960).

In 1962, Celentano founded the Italian record label Clan Celentano (which is still active) with many performers such as Don Backy, Ola &amp; the Janglers, Ricky Gianco, Katty Line, Gino Santercole, Fred Bongusto and his wife Claudia Mori.

As a film director, Celentano frequently cast Ornella Muti, Eleonora Giorgi and his wife Claudia Mori. He and Mori have three children, Rosita, Giacomo and Rosalinda Celentano. Rosalinda is most notable to worldwide audiences for playing Satan in Mel Gibson&#x27;s &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;. Celentano has also hosted several Italian television shows.

Celentano has retained his popularity in Italy for over 50 years, selling millions of records and appearing in numerous TV shows and movies. As part of his TV and movie work, he created a comic genre, with a characteristic walk and facial expressions. For the most part, his films were commercially successful; indeed, in the 1970s and part of the 1980s, his low-budget movies were top of Italian box office rankings. As an actor, critics point to &quot;Serafino&quot; (1968), directed by Pietro Germi, as his best performance.
He has released 40 albums, consisting of 29 studio albums, three live albums, and eight compilations. Among his most popular songs there are &quot;La coppia più bella del mondo&quot;, which sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc; &quot;Azzurro&quot; (1968), written by Paolo Conte, &quot;Svalutation&quot; (1976), and &quot;Prisencolinensinainciusol&quot; (1972), which was written to mimic the way English sounds to non-English speakers despite being almost entirely nonsense.

Celentano was referenced in the 1979 Ian Dury and the Blockheads song and single, &quot;Reasons to Be Cheerful, Part 3&quot;, as one of the aforementioned &quot;reasons to be cheerful&quot;, and in Fellini&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;Ginger and Fred&quot;.

After 18 years without live performances, Celentano&#x27;s 2012 live concert was broadcast on Mediaset channel Canale 5, attracting over 9 million viewers.

==Personal life==
Celentano has been a vegetarian since 2005 and has defended animal rights. A football fan, Celentano is a well-known Inter Milan supporter. Although influenced by American culture, Celentano cannot speak English; he told &quot;la Repubblica&quot; that for years he wanted to learn the language but could not commit, and not knowing English is a &quot;real pain&quot;.

<doc id="372899" wikidata="Q3538166" url="?curid=372899" title="United Food and Commercial Workers">
<text>The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) is a labor union representing approximately 1.3 million workers in the United States and Canada in industries including retail; meatpacking, food processing and manufacturing; hospitality; agriculture; cannabis; chemical trades; security; textile, and health care. UFCW is affiliated with the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC) and the AFL–CIO; it disaffiliated from the AFL–CIO in 2005 but reaffiliated in 2013. UFCW is also affiliated to UNI Global Union and the IUF.

== History ==

The UFCW was created through the merger of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America (AMC) union and Retail Clerks International Union (RCIU), following the new union&#x27;s founding convention in June 1979. William H. Wynn, president of the RCIU and one of the designers of the merger, became president of UFCW at the time of its founding. The merger created the largest union affiliated with the AFL–CIO. The UFCW continued to expand both by organizing and merging with several smaller unions between 1980 and 1998. In 1980, the Barbers, Beauticians and Allied Industries International Association merged with UFCW, followed a year later by the United Retail Workers Union (now Local 881).

The UFCW held its first regular international convention in Montreal, Quebec, in 1983. The Insurance Workers&#x27; International Union also that year voted to have their 15,000 members join the UFCW.

In 1986 the Canadian Brewery Workers Union merged with the UFCW. However, it was also during this time period that the UFCW leadership did not support the Austin, Minnesota meatpackers local (P-9) in its contract dispute with the Hormel Foods Corporation, the 1985–86 Hormel strike. The UFCW ultimately struck a deal with Hormel management, seized control of Local P-9, and removed the local union leaders, actions that dealt a blow to the credibility of the UFCW in the eyes of others in the larger labor movement. This dispute was the subject of the award-winning documentary, &quot;American Dream&quot;.

In 1991 the 5,000 members of the Independent Food Handlers and Warehouse Employees Union in Rhode Island and Massachusetts merged with the UFCW to form Local 791. Bringing about the largest addition to the UFCW since its creation in 1979, on October 1, 1993, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, and their 100,000 members, merged with the UFCW, becoming the RWDSU District Council of the UFCW.

In 1994 Douglas H. Dority was appointed the second international president by the International Executive Board following the retirement of William Wynn. Dority was subsequently elected to remain International President at the UFCW&#x27;s fourth regular International Convention in 1998, and again at the fifth regular convention in 2003. In 1994 the 15,000-member strong United Garment Workers of America also merged with the UFCW. A year later, the 15,000-member Textile Workers and the 15,000-member Distillery, Wine and Allied Workers&#x27; International Union unions merged with the UFCW, forming respectively the UFCW Textile and Garment Council and the UFCW’s Distillery, Wine and Allied Workers Division.

In 1996 the 40,000 members of the International Chemical Workers&#x27; Union merged with the UFCW to form the International Chemical Workers Union Council of the UFCW. A year later, the Canadian Union of Restaurant and Related Employees merged with the UFCW. And the following year, both the United Representatives Guild, Inc. and the Production Service and Sales District Council merged with the UFCW.

In 2003, 80,000 members of the UFCW across the country went on strike to protect their wages and benefit packages.

In 2004 following the retirement of Dority, Joseph T. Hansen was appointed by unanimous vote of the UFCW International Executive Board to be the third international president of the UFCW. He was elected for two consecutive terms as international president by delegates to the UFCW&#x27;s Regular International Conventions in 2008 and 2013.

In 2005 Hansen announced the UFCW was leaving the AFL–CIO, and joined six other unions – the Teamsters, SEIU, UNITE-HERE, Laborers, United Farm Workers and Carpenters – in creating a new labor federation, the Change to Win Federation. On August 8, 2013, the UFCW announced it was changing its affiliation back to AFL–CIO.

On December 15, 2014, Anthony &quot;Marc&quot; Perrone was appointed the fourth international president of the UFCW by the International Executive Board, following the retirement of Hansen.

== Activity ==

=== Canadian agriculture ===
The UFCW has attempted to organize agricultural workers in Ontario, Canada, since 1995, when the provincial government passed legislation prohibiting those workers from joining unions. In 2001 the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in favour of UFCW Canada in the case of &quot;Dunmore v. Ontario&quot;. In the ruling, the Court held that the Ontario government violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms by denying agricultural workers unionization rights under Ontario labor law as it had infringed on those workers&#x27; freedom of association.

In 2004, UFCW Canada and the National Union of Public and General Employees (NUPGE) signed a formal organizing protocol recognizing the UFCW as the union with primary jurisdiction for organizing agricultural workers in Canada and agreeing to cooperate on joint organizing and advocacy campaigns.

=== Medical Cannabis and Hemp Division ===

The cannabis industry was originally targeted for union organizing by UFCW Local 5 special operations director Dan Rush in 2010. After some initial success, Rush has since been serving federal prison time for cheating the union for personal gain by taking bribes from employers, and both the local and international unions have disowned him.

In 2010, Rush brokered a deal in which some California medical-marijuana business owners voted to become UFCW Local 5 members, in return for union endorsement of marijuana law reform. Recognized shops in Oakland included Richard Lee&#x27;s Oaksterdam University, Oaksterdam Gift Shop, Blue Sky Coffee Shop/Dispensary, and the Bulldog Coffee Shop; and AMCD Dispensaries Inc, and the Patient ID Center. Soon after, the workers at Medi-Cone Farms of California joined the union. Between May 2010 and June 2011, more California business owners signed a neutrality agreement with UFCW, including Humboldt Bay Wellness Center and 707 Cannabis College in the Emerald Triangle of the California north coast. The international union realized that the industry consisted of the union&#x27;s core industries, retail pharmacy and healthcare, agriculture, food processing and textiles-with hemp.

Few of these Top-Down Recognitions or Neutrality Agreements resulted in competitive contracts for cannabis workers in California. Only a handful of dispensaries in California have dues-paying members.

On 17 September 2015, the office of the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California announced that a federal grand jury had indicted Rush on a variety of counts on the basis of his cannabis-related union activities. He pled guilty in 2017 and served 37 months in federal prison.

In 2024, UFCW cannabis delivery drivers threatened to strike against Eaze, a California cannabis delivery company. The union reached a tentative agreement with Eaze, which included higher pay, better rules for vehicle reimbursement, and working conditions.

== Work stoppages and conflict with corporations ==
=== 2003 California grocery strike ===
On October 11, 2003, the UFCW declared a strike on Vons (owned by Safeway Inc.), in Southern California, because of company-proposed changes to the new labor contract. These changes included cuts in health care and pension benefits, and the creation of a two-tier system in which new workers would be paid on a different schedule than existing workers. These changes were proposed due to competition from non-union retailers like Walmart. The day following the strike, Albertsons and Ralphs, owned by Kroger, locked out their Southern California employees.

The strike ended on February 26, 2004, when the UFCW and affected companies reached an agreement on a new contract. Union employees voted to end the strike, and many employees cited financial difficulties as a reason for ratifying the agreement. The new labor contract included concessions granted by the chains relating to current employee benefits and wages, and concessions granted by the union relating to creating two tiers of employees and cutting benefits overall.

=== Smithfield Foods ===
During the 1990s and 2000s, the UFCW was embroiled in a dispute with non-unionized meat processing company Smithfield Foods. The UFCW had repeatedly attempted to organize the company&#x27;s Bladen County, North Carolina meat-packing plant, but Smithfield Foods resisted this organizing. In 2007, Smithfield filed a federal lawsuit against the UFCW citing the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), claiming that the union orchestrated a public smear campaign to hurt Smithfield&#x27;s business as a method of extorting the company. In the media, a Smithfield official cited the lawsuit as necessary by claiming that the company was &quot;under attack,&quot; while union officials responded by calling the lawsuit an &quot;attack on democracy and free speech.&quot; In October 2008, the UFCW and Smithfield reached an agreement, under which the union agreed to suspend its boycott campaign in return for the company dropping its RICO lawsuit and allowing another election. On December 10 and 11, workers at the plant voted 2,041 to 1,879 in favor of joining the UFCW, bringing the 15-year fight to an end.

=== Walmart ===

Walmart, a non-unionized company, has repeatedly been accused by the UFCW of treating its workers poorly and driving down employment standards. The UFCW has repeatedly attempted to organize the chain, but these attempts have been unsuccessful in the United States.

In Canada, the UFCW managed to win union recognition at two Walmart stores in Quebec and one in Saskatchewan. Walmart closed the Jonquière store and workers in Saint-Hyacinthe voted to decertify UFCW in 2011. The union has also applied for recognition at a dozen other Walmarts and had won a contract with a Walmart store in Gatineau, Quebec, Canada. After a couple years of unsuccessful negotiations between the union and Walmart the workers at the store decided to leave the union. The last remaining unionized Walmart in North America was located in Weyburn, Saskatchewan. Walmart successfully repelled an attempted UFCW unionization campaign there in August 2013 when the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the union&#x27;s attempt to compel Walmart to reach a collective agreement with it; workers at the Weyburn store then voted 51 to 5 to decertify the union.

In April 2005, as part of a volley of accusatory websites created by Walmart and the UFCW, the union created Wake Up Walmart, a US-based website and campaign with the stated goal of reforming Walmart&#x27;s business practices.

=== Bashas&#x27; ===

In 2007, Bashas&#x27; filed a lawsuit against UFCW with the Supreme Court of Arizona. The lawsuit accused the UFCW and the union&#x27;s operatives - including its &quot;false-front&quot; organization, &quot;Hungry for Respect&quot; - of defamation and intentionally interfering with the grocer&#x27;s operations to extort an agreement for union representation. The company also named Radio Campesina (a project of the United Farm Workers Union founded by Cesar Chavez), Councilman Michael Nowakosky, and Reverend Trina Zelle as defendants.

=== Jim Beam ===

In October 2016, about 250 workers for Beam Suntory (the producer of the whiskey bourbon brand Jim Beam) went on strike over long working hours and the hiring of temporary workers in lieu of permanent full-time workers at two distillery facilities in Kentucky. The strike ended after about a week with a new labor contract that included a cap on the number of temporary workers and a commitment from the company to hire more full-time employees.

===Stop &amp; Shop===
 The 2019 Stop &amp; Shop strike began on April 11, 2019, when approximately 31,000 workers, represented by the UFCW, walked off the job and began picketing Stop &amp; Shop locations in the states of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. The strike was in response to the company not agreeing, after extensive negotiations, to a contract which did not reduce employee pay and benefits. The strike ended eleven days later on April 21. The tentative agreement preserved health and pension benefits and raised employee pay.

=== Heaven Hill ===

In September 2021, about 420 members of UFCW Local 23D went on strike at the Heaven Hill bourbon distillery in Bardstown, Kentucky.

==Political activities==

In the United States, the UFCW&#x27;s political action committee spent $13,440,000 in the 2022 election cycle, 100 percent of which went to Democratic candidates.

==International leadership==

The International Presidents of the United Food and Commercial Workers are:
* William H. Wynn, 1979–1994
* Douglas H. Dority, 1994–2004
* Joseph T. Hansen, 2004–2014
* Marc Perrone, 2014–present

In leading the union, the International President is supported by the International Executive Committee, which, in addition to the president, includes the International Secretary-Treasurer, and the union&#x27;s three International Executive Vice-Presidents, one of whom historically includes the Canadian Director.

The International Secretary-Treasurers of the United Food and Commercial Workers are:
* Samuel J. Talarico, 1979–1982
* Anthony J. Lutty, 1981–1986
* Gerald Robert “Jerry” Menapace, 1986–1995
* Joseph C. Talarico, 1995–1997
* Joseph T. Hansen, 1997–2004
* Marc Perrone, 2004–2014
* Patrick J. O&#x27;Neill, 2014–2016
* Esther Lopez, 2016–2019
* Shaun Barclay, 2019–2023
* Milton Jones, 2023–present

The International Executive Committee is a subcommittee of the International Executive Board, which is the union&#x27;s highest decision making authority between regular conventions. The International Executive Board consists of the members of the International Executive Committee plus 50 International Vice Presidents, all of whom are elected by regular UFCW international conventions.

==Canadian Director==

The UFCW Canadian Director (also known as the National Director and, more recently, the UFCW Canada National President) is the union&#x27;s ranking official based in Canada.

The UFCW Canada National President is elected by Canadian delegates to UFCW regular conventions.

As part of his or her duties, the UFCW Canada National President serves as the union&#x27;s chief spokesperson in Canada, presides over the UFCW Canada national council, and represents the union on the CLC Canadian council.

The UFCW Canada National President also leads the efforts of the UFCW Canada national office, which involve field staff in every Canadian province, as well as dedicated resources and staff for communications, training and education, political and legislative affairs, and special projects.

The UFCW Canada National President also serves on the UFCW International Executive Committee as one of the union&#x27;s three International Executive Vice Presidents.

The Canadian Directors of the United Food and Commercial Workers are:

* Clifford R. Evans, 1988–1992
* Thomas Kukovica, 1992–1999
* Michael J. Fraser, 1999–2006
* Wayne E. Hanley, 2006–2013
* Paul R. Meinema, 2013–2024
* Shawn Haggerty, 2024–present

Prior to 1988, the UFCW&#x27;s efforts in Canada were co-directed by the director of region 18 and the director of region 19.

Region 18 included the former members of the Amalgamated Meat Cutters, and its directors were Romeo Mathieu (1979–1983), Frank Benn (1983–1986), and Willard &quot;Bill&quot; Hanley (1986–1988).

Region 19 included the former members of the Retail Clerks Union, and its director was Clifford R. Evans (1979–1988).

== Landrum–Griffin Act violations ==

The Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (also &quot;LMRDA&quot; or the &quot;Landrum-Griffin Act&quot;), is a United States labor law that regulates labor unions&#x27; internal affairs and their officials&#x27; relationships with employers.

On October 22, 2013, the Office of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS) of the United States Department of Labor accepted a voluntary compliance agreement with United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Local 5 (located in San Jose, Calif.), concerning the challenged election of officers conducted on September 4, 2012, as well as the March 22, 2013 re-run election ordered by the International union. The union agreed to conduct a new election, including new nominations, for the offices of president, secretary-treasurer, recorder, and vice-presidents 1 through 31 under OLMS supervision. The investigation of the challenged election disclosed that union resources were used when the UFCW International President sent a campaign letter to various UFCW officers soliciting contributions and his executive assistant obtained the recipients’ addresses while on union time. The agreement follows an investigation by the OLMS San Francisco-Seattle District Office.

A UFCW member in Southern California filed a complaint in 2013 with the OLMS against former UFCW 1036 Trustees for illegally transferring $100,000.00 from the local union (1036) to UFCW International in a violation of Section 303 of the LMRDA.

A statement reported: &quot;The investigation disclosed that on February 26, 2009, the trustee (Shaun Barclay) appointed by the International (UFCW) to manage the affairs of the local (1036) transferred $100,000 of the local&#x27;s monies to the International...The (UFCW) International... agreed that the transfer was unlawful and should not have occurred&quot;. Funds were returned to the appropriate local unions, following the investigation by the Department of Labor, Office of Labor-Management Standards.

<text>Swiss Chalet is a Canadian chain of casual dining restaurants founded in 1954 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Swiss Chalet has locations in most Canadian provinces, but about 80% are in Ontario and there are currently none in Quebec or British Columbia. Swiss Chalet is among the holdings of Recipe Unlimited, which also owns the fast food chain Harvey&#x27;s. Swiss Chalet and Harvey&#x27;s franchises share many locations.

Swiss Chalet franchises include a variety of points of sale. The company&#x27;s locations generally have an architectural alpine theme, a dining room, a take-out counter, and delivery. Some feature drive-thru windows while other locations in certain urban areas are only take-out counters and are more akin to fast food restaurants. The brand also has an online food ordering system. Recipe Unlimited retails signature Swiss Chalet sauce, gravy, and marinades (as powdered mixes) in Canadian supermarkets.

==History==
The first Swiss Chalet restaurant, at 234 Bloor Street West in Toronto, operated for 52 years. It was founded by Rick Mauran, son of Maurice Mauran the founder of the still-extant Chalet BBQ of Montreal. The building featured exposed-beam ceilings in the Swiss chalet style. This store closed in 2006 and was demolished in 2009 as part of a condominium development.

In the early 2000s, Cara Operations closed all of its Quebec and US-based restaurants.

The company returned to Saskatchewan with a location in south Regina, although this location no longer shows on its website. In 2008, Air Canada added Swiss Chalet food products to its buy-on-board menu.

In 2010, two of the three remaining Swiss Chalet restaurants in the United States closed. They were located in the suburbs of Buffalo, New York. On June 1, 2011, the only company restaurant operating in Puerto Rico closed.

The company began a partnership with the Scene+ loyalty program in February 2015.

On March 31, 2016, the company&#x27;s parent, Cara Operations, announced that it would acquire St-Hubert, a Quebec-based chain of rotisserie chicken restaurants, in the summer of 2016 for CAD$537 million.

==Fare==
Restaurant fare is based upon its signature item, rotisserie chicken. The Quarter Chicken Dinner, the restaurant&#x27;s signature dish, includes a roasted chicken leg or breast with &quot;Chalet Sauce&quot;, a bread roll and a side dish. Swiss Chalet&#x27;s most popular side dish is Chalet fries. Chalet fries were changed in 2015 and again in 2020, to mixed reviews.

<text>Srirangam Srinivasa Rao (30 April 1910 – 15 June 1983), popularly known as Sri Sri, was an Indian poet and lyricist who is known for his works in Telugu literature and films. Noted for his anthology &quot;Maha Prasthanam&quot;, Sri Sri is a recipient of a National Film Award, a Nandi Award and a Sahitya Akademi Award.

He was a member of Pen India, Sahitya Academy, vice-president of the South Indian Film Writers Association, Madras and president of the Revolutionary Writers Association of Andhra.

==Life==
Srirangam Srinivasa Rao, popularly known as Sri Sri, was born into a Telugu speaking family on 30 April 1910 in Visakhapatnam of present-day Andhra Pradesh. His parents were Pudipeddi Venkatramaniah and Atappakonda but was later adopted by Srirangam Suryanarayana. Sri Sri was schooled at Vishakhapatnam and graduated in BA hons at Madras christian college in 1931. He started as a demonstrator at SVS College, Vizag in 1935 and joined as sub-editor at the daily, &quot;Andhra Prabha&quot; in 1938. He later worked at Delhi Akashavani, The State of Hyderabad, and the daily &quot;Andhra Vani&quot;, in various positions. He later married Sarojini, with whom he had a son and three daughters, whose names were Mala Srinivasarao, Venkat Srinivasarao, Manjula Srinivasarao, Mangala Srinivasarao. One of his daughter is serving as a Judge of Madras High Court.

==Literary career==

Srirangam Srinivasa Rao was the first true modern Telugu poet to write about contemporary issues that affected the day-to-day life of a common man in a style and metre which were not used in classical Telugu poetry. He moved poetry forward from traditional mythological themes to reflect more contemporary issues. The essence of his personality was captured by Gudipati Venkatachalam when he compared him with the great romantic Telugu poet Devulapalli Krishnasastri: “While Krishna Sastry made his anguish known to the whole world, Sri Sri spoke in his voice about the anguish of the whole world. Krishna Sastry&#x27;s pain was the pain of the world, while the world&#x27;s pain became Sri Sri&#x27;s pain.”
His book &quot;Maha Prasthanam&quot; (The Great Journey), an anthology of poems, is one of his major works. In one of the poems, &quot;Jagannathuni Ratha Chakralu&quot;, Sri Sri addressed those who were suffering due to social injustices and said, &quot;Don&#x27;t cry, don&#x27;t cry. The wheels of the chariot of Jagannath are coming; they are coming! The apocalyptic chant of the chariot wheels! Come, realize your dreams Rule your new world!&quot; &quot;Other major works include &quot;Siprali&quot; and &quot;Khadga Srushti&quot; (&quot;Creation of the Sword&quot;).

==Telugu cinema==
He entered into Telugu cinema with Ahuti (1950), a Telugu-dubbed version of Junnarkar&#x27;s &quot;Neera aur Nanda&quot; (1946). Some of the songs, such as &quot;Hamsavale O Padava&quot;, &quot;Oogisaladenayya&quot;, &quot;Premaye jannana marana leela&quot;, scored by Saluri Rajeswara Rao, were major hits. Sri Sri was a screenwriter for several Telugu films. He was one of the best film songwriters in India, he has penned lyrics for over 1000 soundtracks in Telugu. He was a great asset to the Telugu film industry.

== Literary style ==
He is a major radical poet (e.g. Prabhava) and novelist (e.g. Veerasimha Vijayasimhulu). He introduced free verse into his socially concerned poetry through Maha Prasthanam. He wrote visionary poems in a style and metre not used before in Telugu classical poetry.

According to Viplava Rachayitala Sangham leader G. Kalyan Rao, Sri Sri was a scientist, a thinker and a philosopher. Maoist ideologue and writer Varavara Rao opined that Sri Sri not only wrote poetry but also practiced what he said.

==Work for human rights==
Sri Sri was the first President of Andhra Pradesh Civil Liberties Committee that was formed in 1974.

<doc id="372916" wikidata="Q649667" url="?curid=372916" title="Dan Savage">
<text>Daniel Keenan Savage (born October 7, 1964) is an American author, media pundit, journalist, and LGBT community activist. He writes &quot;Savage Love&quot;, an internationally syndicated relationship and sex advice column. In 2010, Savage and his husband, Terry Miller, began the It Gets Better Project to help prevent suicide among LGBT youth. He has also worked as a theater director, sometimes credited as Keenan Hollahan.

Born in Chicago to Roman Catholic parents, Savage attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign where he received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in acting. After living in West Berlin from 1988 to 1990, he moved to Madison, Wisconsin, where he befriended Tim Keck, co-founder of &quot;The Onion&quot;. When Keck moved to Seattle, Washington, Savage moved as well to become an advice columnist for &quot;The Stranger&quot;, which Keck founded; he had offered Savage the position after Savage wrote a sample column which impressed him. Savage has since become a sex columnist and a vocal proponent of LGBT rights in the United States, voicing his advocacy through his column, &quot;Savage Love&quot;, and a podcast version of his column, the &quot;Savage Lovecast&quot;. In 2001, Savage and his readership coined the term &quot;pegging&quot; to describe a woman anally penetrating a man with a strap-on dildo.

Outside of his writings and podcasts, Savage has advocated for progressive politics and advancing the rights of LGBT youth to prevent suicide in the community. He has opposed laws restricting pornography and the sale of sex toys, and founded the It Gets Better Project with his husband Terry Miller, whom he married in 2005. Savage has been featured on numerous television programs and news outlets, including &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot; and &quot;Anderson Cooper 360.&quot;

Savage has attracted controversy over his comments and actions related to LGBT issues. He coined the term &quot;santorum&quot; to define a by-product of sex after former senator Rick Santorum made anti-LGBT comments in 2003, and condemned the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for its support of California Proposition 8, which banned same-sex marriage in California. His activism and public speaking has brought praise from celebrities and politicians, including former president Barack Obama.

==Early life and education==
Dan Savage was born in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Judith &quot;Judy&quot; (née Schneider), who worked at Loyola University, and William Savage Sr. He has German and Irish ancestry. The third of four children, he has two brothers and one sister. Savage was raised as a Roman Catholic and attended Quigley Preparatory Seminary North, which he has described as &quot;a Catholic high school in Chicago for boys thinking of becoming priests.&quot; Though Savage has stated that he considers himself &quot;a wishy-washy agnostic&quot; and an atheist, he continues to identify as &quot;culturally Catholic&quot;.

Savage attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where he received a BFA in acting. He lived in West Berlin from late 1988 to 1990.

==Career==

===&quot;Savage Love&quot;===

In 1991, Savage was living in Madison, Wisconsin, and working as a night manager at Four Star Fiction and Video (now Four Star Video Cooperative), a local video store that specialized in independent film titles. He befriended Tim Keck, co-founder of &quot;The Onion,&quot; who announced that he was moving to Seattle to help start an alternative weekly newspaper titled &quot;The Stranger.&quot; Savage &quot;made the offhand comment that forever altered [his] life: &#x27;Make sure your paper has an advice column—everybody claims to hate &#x27;em, but everybody seems to read &#x27;em&#x27;.&quot; Savage wrote a sample column, and to his surprise, Keck offered him the job.

Savage stated in a February 2006 interview in &quot;The Onion&quot;″s &quot;A.V. Club&quot; (which published his column until 2021) that he began the column with the express purpose of providing mocking advice to heterosexuals, since most straight advice columnists were &quot;clueless&quot; when responding to letters from gay people. Savage wanted to call the column &quot;Hey, Faggot!&quot; in an effort to reclaim a hate word. His editors at the time refused his choice of column name, but for the first several years of the column, he attached &quot;Hey, Faggot!&quot; at the beginning of each printed letter as a salutation.&quot; In his February 25, 1999, column, Savage announced that he was retiring the phrase, claiming that the reclamation had been successful.

He has written in a number of columns about &quot;straight rights&quot; concerns, such as the HPV vaccine and the morning-after pill. In his November 9, 2005, column he wrote that &quot;[t]he right-wingers and the fundies and the sex-phobes don&#x27;t just have it in for the queers. They&#x27;re coming for your asses too.&quot;

===Theater===
As a theater director, Savage (under the name Keenan Hollohan, combining his middle name and his paternal grandmother&#x27;s maiden name) was a founder of Seattle&#x27;s Greek Active Theater. Much of the group&#x27;s work were queer interpretations of classic works, such as a tragicomic &quot;Macbeth&quot; with both the title character and Lady Macbeth played by performers of the opposite sex. In March 2001, he directed his own &quot;Egguus&quot; at Consolidated Works, a parody of Peter Shaffer&#x27;s 1973 play &quot;Equus&quot; which exchanged a fixation on horses for a fixation on chickens.

&quot;Letters from the Earth&quot; (2003), also at Consolidated Works, was Savage&#x27;s most recent production. &quot;Letters&quot; was a trimmed version of Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;The Diary of Adam and Eve&quot;. It received scathing reviews, including one from &quot;The Stranger&quot; - &quot;My Boss&#x27;s Show Stinks&quot;.

===Media appearances===
In addition to writing a weekly column and four books, Savage has been involved in several other projects.

From 1994 until 1997, he had a weekly three-hour call-in show called &quot;Savage Love Live&quot; on Seattle&#x27;s KCMU (now KEXP-FM). From 1998 to 2000, he ran the biweekly advice column &quot;Dear Dan&quot; on the news website abcnews.com.

He is now the editorial director of the weekly Seattle newspaper &quot;The Stranger&quot;, a promotion from his former position as &quot;The Stranger&quot;″s editor-in-chief. Savage stars in &quot;Savage U&quot; on MTV, contributes frequently to &quot;This American Life&quot; and &quot;Out&quot; magazine, and acts as a &quot;Real Time Real Reporter&quot; on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher.&quot; He has also made multiple appearances on MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot; and CNN&#x27;s &quot;Anderson Cooper 360&quot;, to discuss LGBT political issues, such as same-sex marriage and Don&#x27;t Ask Don&#x27;t Tell.

In 2014, he participated in &quot;Do I Sound Gay?&quot;, a documentary film by David Thorpe about stereotypes of gay men&#x27;s speech patterns.

In 2016, he was the first guest of &quot;Twice Removed&quot;, a family history podcast hosted by A. J. Jacobs. In the episode, Savage&#x27;s lineage was traced to Nan Britton, Paul Popham, and others.

===Podcast===

The &quot;Savage Lovecast&quot; is a weekly audio podcast based on the column &quot;Savage Love,&quot; available via iTunes and at the &quot;Stranger&quot;″s website for free download. It features Savage answering anonymous questions left by callers on a voice recorder (answering machine). He often returns calls to questioners who give their phone numbers, and such phone calls are part of the podcast. He also consults with doctors, sex therapists, and other experts for answers to questions he calls &quot;above my pay grade&quot;. There are frequent guest co-hosts, all of them sex-positive. It is routinely rated as the top podcast in the iTunes &quot;Health&quot; category and in the top 20 of all podcasts overall. A.V. Club listed the show as one of &quot;The best podcasts of 2010&quot; and later as one of &quot;The best podcasts of 2013&quot;. &quot;The Atlantic&quot; listed the show as one of &quot;The 50 Best Podcasts of 2016&quot;.

===&quot;The Real O&#x27;Neals&quot;===

Based on an idea by Savage (who also served as executive producer), the ABC television series &quot;The Real O&#x27;Neals&quot;, starring Noah Galvin, debuted in 2016. The series chronicles the lives of a close-knit, Irish-American Chicago Catholic family whose matriarch takes their reputation in the community very seriously. In the pilot episode, their perfect image is shattered when each family member has a secret revealed to the community: middle child Kenny is gay, oldest child Jimmy is anorexic, youngest child Shannon is running a money scam and might be an atheist, and parents Eileen and Pat are no longer in love and wish to divorce. The series lasted for two seasons before its cancellation.

==Personal life==

Savage married Terry Miller in Vancouver in 2005. Following the 2012 legalization of same-sex marriage in Washington state, he and Miller were part of the first group of 11 couples to receive Washington state marriage licenses. Savage and Miller were married on December 9, 2012, at Seattle City Hall, opened on Sunday especially for the purpose of hosting the first same-sex weddings in Washington state, with Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn and others in attendance. The couple has a son, whom they adopted as an infant . Savage chronicled the experience of adopting their son in his 1999 book &quot;The Kid: What Happened After My Boyfriend and I Decided to Go Get Pregnant&quot;.

== Causes ==

=== It Gets Better Project ===
On September 21, 2010, Savage founded the It Gets Better Project following the suicide of 15-year-old Billy Lucas, who was bullied for his perceived sexual orientation. The project encourages adults, both LGBT and otherwise, to submit videos assuring gay teenagers that life can improve after bullying in early life. As of November 2013, the project had more than 50,000 user-created testimonials and had been viewed over 50 million times.

=== Hump pornography festival ===

Savage coordinates the annual Hump pornography festival, which is made up of clips of up to five minutes on any pornographic topic, submitted by viewers. Winning submissions are shown in theaters around the United States, providing a unique experience as straight, gay male, bi, lesbian, and fetish porn are all shown together, one after another. Savage publicly destroys the submissions after conclusion of the festival.

====Campaign for the neologism &quot;santorum&quot; ====

After Rick Santorum, then a U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, made comments in 2003 to a reporter comparing homosexual sex to bestiality and incest, Savage assailed Santorum in his column. Later, he sponsored a contest that led to the term &quot;santorum&quot; being used to refer to &quot;the frothy mixture of lube and fecal matter that is sometimes a byproduct of anal sex&quot;. Savage set up a website to publicize this application of the term. In 2010, Savage offered to take down his website if Rick Santorum would agree to donate US$5 million to a gay rights group. The organization, Freedom to Marry, advocates on behalf of same-sex marriage in the United States. Savage told &quot;Mother Jones&quot; in 2010, &quot;If Rick Santorum wants to make a $5 million donation to [the gay marriage group] Freedom to Marry, I will take it down. Interest starts accruing now.&quot; Evan Wolfson, executive director of Freedom to Marry, responded in a statement to &quot;Metro Weekly&quot;, &quot;Support for Freedom to Marry&#x27;s national campaign would be welcome—and a good way for Rick Santorum to start cleaning up the discriminatory mess he and his companions have made.&quot; Santorum condemned the campaign and accused Savage of defaming him. Savage responded by further denouncing Santorum and accused him of propagating discrimination against the LGBT community through his viewpoints.

In 2009 Savage invited his readers to vote to define &quot;saddlebacking&quot; as &quot;the phenomenon of Christian teens engaging in unprotected anal sex to preserve their virginities.&quot; He was protesting the vocal support given to California Proposition 8 by Rick Warren (pastor of Saddleback Church), and President Barack Obama&#x27;s invitation to Warren to give the invocation at his inauguration. When Savage vowed to boycott Utah due to strong Mormon support for Proposition 8, the &quot;Salt Lake City Weekly&quot; dropped Savage&#x27;s column.

===Local issues===
Savage&#x27;s editorship of &quot;The Stranger&quot; has established him as a voice in local Seattle politics. His most high-profile commentary has been as an outspoken critic of the Teen Dance Ordinance and other crackdowns on all-ages events.

Savage argues that closing down supervised all-ages dance venues drives teens to boredom and reckless activities: &quot;Places like Ground Zero and the Kirkland Teen Center are invaluable from a law enforcement point of view. They keep kids out of, say, 7-Eleven parking lots or the homes of friends whose parents are away.&quot;

==Views==
=== U.S. politics ===

Savage tends toward liberal political views, with pronounced contrarian and libertarian streaks. He frequently mentions political issues in his column, particularly issues that affect family planning, birth control, and sexuality. He often encourages readers to get involved and/or voice a positive or negative opinion about a politician or public official.

Savage has also opposed state legislation prohibiting the sale of sex toys. After an exposé by Kandiss Crone from WLBT in Jackson, Mississippi, precipitated the arrest and fining of an adult video store owner, Savage satirically suggested that readers send Crone any sex toys that they needed to dispose of.

In a 2006 interview with the &quot;Daily Pennsylvanian&quot;, Savage claimed that Carl Romanelli, who was briefly the Green Party&#x27;s candidate for U.S. Senate in that year&#x27;s election in Pennsylvania, was partially funded by state Republicans for a spoiler effect against Democrat Bob Casey Jr., and further stated that Romanelli &quot;should be dragged behind a pickup truck until there&#x27;s nothing left but the rope&quot;. He also said that if Romanelli, who had been disqualified from appearing on the general election ballot, was allowed back on the ballot, &quot;someone should run him over with a truck&quot;. Immediately after the interview, Savage wrote, &quot;I regret using that truck metaphor, and didn&#x27;t mean it literally, and it was in poor taste, and I regret it.&quot;

On a 2011 episode of &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;, during a panel discussion on the debt limit increase negotiations between the U.S. Congress and President Barack Obama, Savage said, &quot;I wish [the Republicans] were all fucking dead.&quot; He apologized for the comment on his blog later the same night, saying, &quot;I don&#x27;t feel that way&quot;, adding that his father voted Republican, and calling it &quot;a stupid, rude, thoughtless remark, a flubbed expression of disgust&quot;.

====2000 Iowa caucuses====
In January 2000, Savage traveled to Iowa to write about the state&#x27;s presidential caucuses for &quot;Salon&quot;. He wrote that he had planned &quot;to follow one of the loopy conservative Christian candidates around—[Gary] Bauer or [Alan] Keyes—and write something insightful and humanizing about him, his campaign, and his supporters&quot;, but he was so angered by remarks that Bauer made in opposition to same-sex marriage that he abandoned the idea.

Instead, Savage, who had been sick with influenza, said that he volunteered for the Bauer campaign with the intent to spread his flu to the candidate and his supporters. He claimed to have licked numerous items in the campaign office, including doorknobs, office supplies, and coffee cups, and later covered a pen in his saliva before handing it to Bauer. Savage incurred criticism for the story. Camille Paglia, who also contributed to &quot;Salon&quot; at the time, called his described behavior &quot;sociopathic&quot;, and the publication said that they did not &quot;condone or endorse&quot; his actions. Savage later said that the article was exaggerated for comedic effect, stating that the anecdote about &quot;licking doorknobs&quot; was fictitious, and that he was &quot;no longer contagious&quot; by the time he joined the campaign team.

Savage also reported registering and participating in the Iowa Republican caucus, which was illegal, as he was not an Iowa resident. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of fraudulent voting in a caucus, and was sentenced to a year&#x27;s probation, 50 hours of community service, and a $750 fine.

===Other remarks===

Savage initially supported the Iraq War and advocated military action against other Middle Eastern states, including Iran and Saudi Arabia, saying, &quot;Islamo-fascism is a regional problem, like European fascism—and the Middle East [has] to be remade just as Europe was remade&quot;. However, one week before the war began, Savage spoke against it, citing the inability of President George W. Bush to form a convincing case and sway the UN and NATO allies. By 2005 he deemed the situation &quot;hopeless&quot; and advocated an immediate troop withdrawal.

Savage describes his view toward family as &quot;conservative&quot;. He has, however, expressed skepticism of &quot;simplistic&quot; views of monogamy. In response to a letter asking &quot;Is the AIDS crisis over?&quot; Savage, in his October 22, 1997 column, answered simply, &quot;Yes&quot;. Several weeks of columns were devoted in whole or in part to discussion of the issue. Savage also opposes the tactics of the War on Drugs, and opposes the prohibition of certain controlled substances.

In 2006, Savage said that outing is &quot;brutal and it should be reserved for brutes&quot;, writing it should not be done outside of particular circumstances, such as a closeted person publicly advocating against gay rights.

On the topic of child sexuality, Savage said in 2001:
Savage has spoken out against child sexual abuse. In 2017, when Kevin Spacey was accused of attacking then-14 year old Anthony Rapp while drunk, Spacey released a statement which included coming out as gay. Savage responded that there is &quot;no amount of drunk or closeted that excuses or explains away assaulting a 14-year-old child&quot;.

In 2011, Lindy West published a piece in &quot;The Stranger&quot; criticizing Savage, her boss at the time, for repeated comments about fat people in his columns, such as &quot;rolls of exposed flesh are unsightly&quot;, which she called &quot;a cruel, subjective opinion&quot;, concluding &quot;you need to understand that shaming an already-shamed population is, well, shameful.&quot; This incident was later fictionalized in the Hulu TV series &quot;Shrill&quot;.

Savage also came under scrutiny for an anti-bullying speech he gave in 2012, to the National High School Journalism Convention, in which he encouraged the attending students to &quot;learn to ignore the bullshit in the Bible about gay people&quot;, prompting some students to leave the auditorium. Savage apologized on April 29 for calling the walkout &quot;a pansy-assed move&quot;, saying, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t calling the handful of students who left pansies (2,800+ students, most of them Christian, stayed and listened), just the walkout itself.&quot; Savage stood by the central point of his speech.

====Comments on transgender issues====
In 2011, J. Bryan Lowder of &quot;Slate&quot; stated wrote Savage &quot;often takes heat for his less-than-refined statements on issues like the existence of male bisexuality, the responsibility of asexuals to &#x27;come out&#x27; before dating, and, indeed, certain issues surrounding transgenderism.&quot; Savage has repeatedly been the focus of controversy for his use of slurs regarding the transgender community, other remarks regarding trans issues, and for claiming as a joke that Rob McKenna, who was attorney general of Washington from 2005 to 2013, is a transgender man, though he is not. He has been glitter bombed three times, twice in 2011 and once in 2012, by protesters who alleged that he is transphobic, among other accusations.

In 2014, during a seminar at the University of Chicago on social media, Savage discussed his past use of the word &quot;tranny&quot;. He objected to a student&#x27;s request that he use the phrase &quot;T-slur&quot; instead, and gave examples of other slurs. Some students criticized him, claiming that he tried to make the student feel threatened and uncomfortable. A University representative said, &quot;A guest used language that provoked a spirited debate. The speaker was discussing how hurtful words can be repurposed and used to empower; at no point did he direct any slurs at anyone.&quot; Savage later thanked the University for standing up for him and demanded an apology from those who had accused him of hatred towards trans people.

==Works==

In addition to his advice column, Savage has written four books, edited one book, and authored various op-ed pieces in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

<doc id="372920" wikidata="Q1133152" url="?curid=372920" title="Atlantic horseshoe crab">
<text>The Atlantic horseshoe crab (Limulus polyphemus), also known as the American horseshoe crab, is a species of horseshoe crab, a kind of marine and brackish chelicerate arthropod. It is found in the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic coast of North America. The main area of annual migration is Delaware Bay along the South Jersey Delaware Bayshore.

Their eggs were eaten by Native Americans, but today Atlantic horseshoe crabs are caught for use as fishing bait, in biomedicine (especially for &quot;Limulus&quot; amebocyte lysate) and science. They play a major role in the local ecosystems, with their eggs providing an important food source for shorebirds, and the juveniles and adults being eaten by sea turtles.

The other three extant (living) species in the family Limulidae are also called horseshoe crabs, but they are restricted to Asia. Despite the name, horseshoe crabs are more closely related to arachnids like spiders and scorpions than they are to crabs or other crustaceans.

==Names and classification==
This group of animals is also known as horsefoot, or saucepan. Some people call the horseshoe crab a &quot;helmet crab&quot;, but this common name is more frequently applied to a true crab, a malacostracan, of the species &quot;Telmessus cheiragonus&quot;. The term &quot;king crab&quot; is sometimes used for horseshoe crabs, but it is more usually applied to a group of decapod crustaceans.

&quot;Limulus&quot; means &quot;askew&quot; and &quot;polyphemus&quot; refers to Polyphemus, a giant in Greek mythology. It is based on the misconception that the animal had a single eye.

Former scientific names include &quot;Limulus cyclops&quot;, &quot;Xiphosura americana&quot;, and &quot;Polyphemus occidentalis&quot;.

It is the tail that earns this order its name Xiphosura, which derives from the ancient Greek word for &quot;sword tail&quot;.

Studies of microsatellite DNA have revealed several distinct geographic groups in the Atlantic horseshoe crab. While there is extensive mixing between neighbouring populations, primarily due to movements by males, there is little or no mixing between the US and isolated Yucatán Peninsula horseshoe crabs, leading some to suggest that a taxonomic review is necessary.

==Anatomy and physiology==
Horseshoe crabs have three main parts to the body: the head region, known as the &quot;prosoma&quot;, the abdominal region or &quot;opisthosoma&quot;, and the spine-like tail or &quot;telson&quot;. The smooth shell or carapace is shaped like a horseshoe, and is greenish grey to dark brown in colour. The sexes are similar in appearance, but females are typically 25 to 30% larger than the male in length and width, and can reach more than twice the weight. Females can grow up to in length, including tail, and in weight. There are also geographic differences: In the United States, there is a north–south cline in the size. Central animals, between Georgia and Cape Cod, are the largest. North of Cape Cod and south of Georgia they gradually become smaller. In Delaware Bay, females and males have an average carapace width of about and , respectively. In Florida, females average about and males . However, this north-south pattern does not exist in the Yucatán Peninsula, the southernmost population of the species, where some subpopulations are intermediate between the Delaware Bay and Florida horseshoe crabs, and others are smaller, averaging about the size of Florida horseshoe crabs.

Horseshoe crabs regrow lost limbs similar to many other arthropods.

A wide range of marine species become attached to the carapace, including algae, flat worms, mollusks, barnacles, and bryozoans, and horseshoe crabs have been described as &#x27;walking museums&#x27; due to the number of organisms they can support. In areas where &quot;Limulus&quot; is common, the shells, exoskeletons or exuviae (molted shells) of horseshoe crabs frequently wash up on beaches, either as whole shells, or as disarticulated pieces.

The brain and the heart are located in the prosoma. On the underside of the prosoma, six pairs of appendages occur, the first of which (the small pincers or chelicerae) are used to pass food into the mouth, which is located in the middle of the underside of the cephalothorax, between the chelicerae. Although most arthropods have mandibles, the horseshoe crab is jawless.

The second pair of appendages, the pedipalps, are used as walking legs; in males they are tipped with &#x27;claspers&#x27;, which are used during mating to hold onto the female&#x27;s carapace. The remaining four pairs of appendages are the &#x27;pusher legs&#x27;, also used in locomotion. The first four pairs of legs have claws, the last pair has a leaf-like structure used for pushing.

The opisthosoma bears a further six pairs of appendages; the first pair houses the genital pores, while the remaining five pairs are modified into flattened plates, known as book gills, that allow them to breathe underwater, and can also allow them to breathe on land for short periods of time, provided the gills remain moist.

The telson (i.e., tail or caudal spine) is used to steer in the water and also to flip itself over if stuck upside down.

Among other senses, they have a small chemoreceptor organ that senses smells on the triangular area formed by the exoskeleton beneath the body near the ventral eyes.

===Vision===
&quot;Limulus&quot; has been extensively used in research into the physiology of vision. The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded in 1967 in part for research performed on the horseshoe crab eye.

A large compound eye with monochromatic vision is found on each side of the prosoma; it has five simple eyes on the carapace, and two simple eyes on the underside, just in front of the mouth, making a total of nine eyes. The simple eyes are probably important during the embryonic or larval stages of the organism, and even unhatched embryos seem to be able to sense light levels from within their buried eggs. The less sensitive compound eyes, and the median ocelli, become the dominant sight organs during adulthood.

In addition, the tail bears a series of light-sensing organs along its length.

Each compound eye is composed of about 1000 receptors called ommatidia, complex structures consisting of upwards of 300 cells. The ommatidia are somewhat messily arranged, not falling into the ordered hexagonal pattern seen in more derived arthropods. Each ommatidium feeds into a single nerve fiber. Furthermore, the nerves are large and relatively accessible. This made it possible for electrophysiologists to record the nervous response to light stimulation easily, and to observe visual phenomena such as lateral inhibition working at the cellular level. More recently, behavioral experiments have investigated the functions of visual perception in &quot;Limulus&quot;. Habituation and classical conditioning to light stimuli have been demonstrated, as has the use of brightness and shape information by males when recognizing potential mates.
The retinula (literally, &quot;small retina&quot;) cells of the ommatidium of the compound eye contain areas from which membranous organelles of conceivable size (rhabdomeres) extend. Rhabdomeres have tiny microvilli (tiny tubes extending out of the retinula) that interlock with neighboring retinular cells. This forms the rhabdom, which contains the dendrite of the eccentric cell, and may also contribute some microvilli. The only other species with an eccentric cell is the silkworm moth. Microvilli are composed of a double layer, 7 nm each and with 3.5 nm space of two electron-deficient boundaries in between. Where the microvilli meet, these outer borders fuse and yield five membranes about 15 nm thick. In all arthropods, there is always a rhabdom below a crystalline cone, on or near the center of the ommatidium, and always aligned with the path of light. At right angles to the length of the rhabdome are the length of the microvilli, which are in line with each other. The microvilli are about 40–150 nm in diameter.

===Blood===

The blood of horseshoe crabs (as well as that of most mollusks, including cephalopods and gastropods) contains the copper-containing protein hemocyanin at concentrations of about 50 g per liter. These creatures do not have hemoglobin (iron-containing protein), which is the basis of oxygen transport in vertebrates. Hemocyanin is colorless when deoxygenated and dark blue when oxygenated. The blood in the circulation of these creatures, which generally live in cold environments with low oxygen tensions, is grey-white to pale yellow, and it turns dark blue when exposed to the oxygen in the air, as seen when they bleed. Hemocyanin carries oxygen in extracellular fluid, which is in contrast to the intracellular oxygen transport in vertebrates by hemoglobin in red blood cells.

The blood of horseshoe crabs contains one type of blood cell, the amebocytes. These play an important role in the defense against pathogens. Amebocytes contain granules with a clotting factor known as coagulogen; this is released outside the cell when bacterial endotoxin is encountered. The resulting coagulation is thought to contain bacterial infections in the animal&#x27;s semiclosed circulatory system.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Atlantic horseshoe crab is the only extant (living) species of horseshoe crab native to the Americas, although there are other extinct species only known from fossil remains from this region. The other living species of horseshoe crab are restricted to Asia, but all are quite similar in form and behavior. The Asian species are &quot;Tachypleus tridentatus&quot;, &quot;Tachypleus gigas&quot; and &quot;Carcinoscorpius rotundicauda&quot;.

Most Atlantic horseshoe crabs are found along the Atlantic East Coast of the United States, ranging from Maine to Florida. In the Gulf Coast of the United States, they are found in Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. Outside the United States, the only breeding population is in Mexico&#x27;s Yucatán Peninsula, where it is found on the western, northern and eastern coasts. Individuals rarely appear outside the breeding range, with a few records from the Atlantic coast of Canada (Lahave Island on Nova Scotia), the Bahamas, the Turks and Caicos, Cuba and the western Gulf of Mexico (Texas and Veracruz). Historic claims of horseshoe crabs on Jamaica and Hispaniola (on the Dominican Republic&#x27;s southeast coast) have not resulted in any discoveries after expeditions there. There have been attempts of introducing it to Texas, California and the southern North Sea, but these all failed to become established. Records from Europe, Israel and Western Africa are considered releases/escapees of captives.

Atlantic horseshoe crabs range from shallow coastal habitats such as lagoons, estuaries and mangrove to depths of more than up to offshore. There are indications that they prefer depths shallower than . The temperature preference varies depending on the population, with the northernmost being the most cold-resistant: in the Great Bay in New Hampshire they show increased activity above and in Delaware Bay they are active above . In contrast, these northern populations do not tolerate as warm temperatures as southern populations of the species. Atlantic horseshoe crabs can be seen in waters that range from brackish (almost fresh water) to hypersaline (almost twice the salinity of sea water), but their optimum growth is at salinities around or slightly below sea water (20–40‰).

A 2022 study of ancient (Early Pleistocene, 2 million years ago) environmental DNA from the Kap Kobenhavn Formation of northern Greenland identified preserved DNA fragments of horseshoe crabs, assigned to &quot;L. polyphemus&quot;. This suggests that horseshoe crabs ranged and spawned as far north as Greenland during these warmer conditions. Around this time, the sea surface temperature would have been 8 °C warmer than the present. These are among the oldest DNA fragments ever sequenced.

==Life cycle and behavior==
The crab feeds on mollusks, annelid worms, other benthic invertebrates, and bits of fish. Lacking jaws, it grinds up the food with bristles on its legs and a gizzard that contains sand and gravel.

Spawning tends to occur in the intertidal zone and to be correlated with spring tides (the highest tides of the month). The breeding season varies. Northern populations (all in the United States, except those in southern Florida) generally breed from the spring to the autumn, while southern populations (southern Florida and Yucatán Peninsula) breed year-round. In the north, breeding is triggered by a temperature increase, but this is reversed in the Yucatán Peninsula, the southernmost population, where decreasing temperatures stimulate breeding. In Massachusetts, horseshoe crabs spend the winters on the continental shelf and emerge at the shoreline in late spring to spawn, with the males arriving first. The smaller male grabs on to the back of a female with a &quot;boxing glove&quot; like structure on his front claws, often holding on for months at a time. Often several males will hold on to a single female. Females reach the beach at high tide. After the female has laid a batch of eggs in a nest at a depth of in the sand, the male or males fertilize them with their sperm. Egg quantity is dependent on the female&#x27;s body size, and ranges from 15,000 to 64,000 eggs per female.

Development begins when the first egg cover splits and new membrane, secreted by the embryo, forms a transparent spherical capsule. The larvae form and then swim for about five to seven days. After swimming, they settle, and begin the first molt. This occurs about 20 days after the formation of the egg capsule. As young horseshoe crabs grow, they move to deeper waters, where molting continues. Before becoming sexually mature around age 9, they have to shed their shells some 17 times. In the first 2–3 years of their life, the juveniles stay in shallow coastal waters near the breeding beaches. Longevity is difficult to assess, but the average lifespan is thought to be 20–40 years.

Research from the University of New Hampshire gives insight into the circadian rhythm of Atlantic horseshoe crabs. For example, several studies have looked into the effect of a circa tidal rhythm on the locomotion of this species. While it has been known for a while that a circadian clock system controls eye sensitivity, scientists discovered a separate clock system for locomotion. When a sample of Atlantic horseshoe crabs were exposed to artificial tidal cycles in the lab, circa tidal rhythms were observed. The study found that light and dark cycles influence locomotion, but not as much as tidal activity.

==Evolution==
Horseshoe crabs were traditionally grouped with the extinct eurypterids (sea scorpions) as the Merostomata. However, recent studies suggest a relationship between the eurypterids and the arachnids, leaving Xiphosura in the clade Prosomapoda. They may have evolved in the shallow seas of the Paleozoic Era (541–252 million years ago) with other primitive arthropods like the trilobites. The four species of horseshoe crab are the only remaining members of the Xiphosura, one of the oldest classes of marine arthropods.

The oldest known horseshoe crab, &quot;Lunataspis aurora&quot;, from head to tail-tip, has been identified in 445-million-year-old Ordovician strata in Manitoba.

Horseshoe crabs are often referred to as living fossils, as they have changed little in the last 445 million years. Forms almost identical to this species were present during the Triassic period 230 million years ago, and similar species were present in the Devonian, 400 million years ago. However, horseshoe crab preservation in the fossil record is extremely rare and the Atlantic horseshoe crab itself has no fossil record at all. Until recently it was thought that the genus &quot;Limulus&quot; &quot;ranges back only some 20 million years, not 200 million&quot;.

The oldest member of the subfamily Limulinae are known from the Late Jurassic (Tithonian), belonging to the species &quot;Crenatolimulus darwini&quot; from Poland. The oldest and currently only other known species in the genus &quot;Limulus&quot; is &quot;Limulus coffini&quot; from the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) of the United States.

== Medical uses ==
Horseshoe crabs are valuable as a species to the medical research community, and in medical testing. An extract of blood cells (amoebocytes) from &quot;Limulus polyphemus&quot; is a critical component in the widely used &quot;Limulus&quot; amebocyte lysate (LAL) test to detect and quantify bacterial endotoxins in pharmaceuticals and to test for several bacterial diseases. A protein from horseshoe crab blood is also under investigation as a novel antibiotic.

Procuring the raw materials for LAL testing involves collecting and bleeding horseshoe crabs from wild populations. Horseshoe crabs are returned to the ocean after bleeding, however, there is a level of mortality and sub-lethal impact involved. It is estimated that between 10 and 30 percent of horseshoe crabs die after bleeding.

Studies show the blood volume returns to normal in about a week, though blood cell count can take two to three months to fully rebound. Animals that survive the process may be more lethargic when released and less likely to mate – which has prompted concerns about the longer-term impacts of harvesting horseshoe crabs.

The LAL test is a major source of animal product dependence in the biomedical industry, and a challenge to the Three Rs of science in relation to the use of animals in testing. There are efforts to reduce the dependence on horseshoe crabs, refine the process of collecting blood from the animals (including through aquaculture), and even replace the use of animal-derived assays utilizing synthetic approaches, such as the recombinant factor C (rFC) assay.

==Conservation and management==
Overall the Atlantic horseshoe crab is recognized as vulnerable by the IUCN due primarily to overharvesting and habitat loss. There are, however, significant geographic differences with some populations increasing, some stable and some declining.

===United States===

Early in the 20th century and possibly before, there was the mistaken belief in some areas that horseshoe crabs were destructive to fisheries, folklore held that they used their long spines to drill into some shellfish. Because of this mistaken belief and folklore, bounties were sometimes offered by authorities for them. On Cape Cod in the early 20th century five cents was offered for every dead horseshoe crab turned in.

The Atlantic horseshoe crab is not presently endangered, but harvesting and habitat destruction have reduced its numbers at some locations and caused some concern for this animal&#x27;s future. Since the 1970s, the horseshoe crab population has been decreasing in some areas, due to several factors, including the use of the crab as bait in eel, whelk and conch trapping. According to the Horseshoe Crab Benchmark Stock Assessment Peer Review Report published by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC), the population continues to remain stable where biomedical is present in the Northeast and thrive and grow in the Southeast due to protection efforts – a trend spanning decades.

Conservationists have also voiced concerns about the declining population of shorebirds, such as red knots, which rely heavily on the horseshoe crabs&#x27; eggs for food during their spring migration. Precipitous declines in the population of the red knots have been observed in recent years. Predators of horseshoe crabs, such as the currently threatened Atlantic loggerhead turtle, have also suffered as crab populations diminish.

In 1991, the species was provided legislated protection from bait fishing in South Carolina by calling on the management and regulation of the horseshoe crab fisheries, allowing only hand-collecting for biomedical applications and marine biological research. Without the need for LAL in biomedical use, the legal protection of the horseshoe crab is not guaranteed in the future, and they would again fall prey to overfishing and use as bait. In 1995, the nonprofit Ecological Research and Development Group (ERDG) was founded with the aim of preserving the four remaining species of horseshoe crab. Since its inception, the ERDG has made significant contributions to horseshoe crab conservation. ERDG founder Glenn Gauvry designed a mesh bag for whelk/conch traps, to prevent other species from removing the bait. This has led to a decrease in the amount of bait needed by approximately 50%. In the state of Virginia, these mesh bags are mandatory in whelk/conch fishery. The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission in 2006 considered several conservation options, among them being a two-year ban on harvesting the animals, affecting both Delaware and New Jersey shores of Delaware Bay. In June 2007, Delaware Superior Court Judge Richard Stokes has allowed limited harvesting of 100,000 males. He ruled that while the crab population was seriously depleted by overharvesting through 1998, it has since stabilized, and that this limited take of males will not adversely affect either horseshoe crab or red knot populations. In opposition, Delaware environmental secretary John Hughes concluded that a decline in the red knot bird population was so significant that extreme measures were needed to ensure a supply of crab eggs when the birds arrived. Harvesting of the crabs was banned in New Jersey on March 25, 2008.
Every year, about 10% of the horseshoe crab breeding population dies when rough surf flips the creatures onto their backs, a position from which they often cannot right themselves. In response, the ERDG launched a &quot;Just Flip &#x27;Em&quot; campaign, in the hopes that beachgoers will simply turn the crabs back over. New Jersey beaches campaign &quot;ReTURN the Favor&quot;, trains volunteers to rescue impinged and overturned horseshoe crabs while collecting data on natural and man-made hazards.

A large-scale project to tag and count horseshoe crabs along the North American coast was started in 2008, termed Project Limulus.
Due to the lack of information and knowledge regarding horseshoe crab populations, the management policies lack any abundance of rules and regulations. To implement management policies for the species, more population information needs to be obtained.

===Mexico===
Since 1994, the populations in the Yucatán Peninsula have been recognized as endangered under Mexican law. They have declined since the 1960s and remaining significant Yucatán populations are mostly within protected areas.

<text>A wine bottle is a bottle, generally a glass bottle, that is used for holding wine. Some wines are fermented in the bottle while others are bottled only after fermentation. Recently the bottle has become a standard unit of volume to describe sales in the wine industry, measuring . Wine bottles are produced, however, in a variety of volumes and shapes.

Wine bottles are traditionally sealed with a cork, but screw-top caps are becoming popular, and there are several other methods used to seal a bottle.

==Sizes==
Many traditional wine bottle sizes are named for Biblical kings and historical figures. The chart below lists the sizes of various wine bottles in multiples relating to a standard bottle of wine, which is (six 125 mL servings). The &quot;wineglassful&quot;—an official unit of the apothecaries&#x27; system of weights—is much smaller at .

Most champagne houses are unable to carry out secondary fermentation in bottles larger than a magnum due to the difficulty in riddling large, heavy bottles. After the secondary fermentation completes, the champagne must be transferred from the magnums into larger bottles, which results in a loss of pressure. Some believe this re-bottling exposes the champagne to greater oxidation and therefore results in an inferior product compared to champagne which remains in the bottle in which it was fermented.
* For many years, the US standard (non-metric) wine and liquor bottle was the &quot;fifth&quot;, meaning one-fifth of a US gallon, or . Some beverages also came in tenth-gallon [], eighth-gallon [1 US pint, or ], sixth-gallon [], fourth-gallon [1 US quart, or ], half-gallon [] and one-gallon [] sizes. In 1979, the US adopted the metric system for liquor bottles, with the basic wine bottle becoming 750 mL, as in Europe.

==Shapes==


Wine producers in Portugal, Italy, Spain, France and Germany follow the tradition of their local areas in choosing the shape of bottle most appropriate for their wine.

* Port, sherry, and Bordeaux varieties: straight-sided and high-shouldered with a pronounced punt. Port and sherry bottles may have a bulbous neck to collect any residue.
* Burgundies and Rhône varieties: tall bottles with sloping shoulders and a smaller punt.
* Schlegel variety, predominantly used in German wine growing regions: similar to Burgundy bottles, but more slender and elongated.
* Rhine (also known as hock or hoch), Mosel, and Alsace varieties: narrow and tall with little or no punt.
* Champagne and other sparkling wines: thick-walled and wide with a pronounced punt and sloping shoulders (resembling Burgundy bottles).
* German wines from Franconia: the Bocksbeutel bottle.
* The Chianti and some other Italian wines: the &quot;fiasco&quot;, a round-bottomed flask encased in a straw basket. This is more often used for everyday table wines; many of the higher-grade Chianti producers have switched to Bordeaux-type bottles.

Many North and South American, South African, and Australasian wine producers select the bottle shape with which they wish to associate their wines. For instance, a producer who believes his wine is similar to Burgundy may choose to bottle his wine in Burgundy-style bottles.

Other producers (both in and out of Europe) have chosen idiosyncratic bottle styles for marketing purposes. Pere-Anselme markets its Châteauneuf-du-Pape in bottles that appear half-melted. The Moselland company of Bernkastel-Kues in Germany has a Riesling with a bottle in the shape of a stylized cat. The British company Garçon Wines makes a flat wine bottle from recycled PET which is flat enough to fit through a letterbox and hence can be delivered by post.

The home wine maker may use any bottle, as the shape of the bottle does not affect the taste of the finished product. The sole exception is in producing sparkling wine, where thicker-walled bottles should be used to handle the excess pressure.

Most wine bottles standards have a bore (inner neck) diameter of 18.5 mm at the mouth of the bottle and increase to 21 mm before expanding into the full bottle.

== Foils and netting ==
Commercial corked wine bottles typically have a protective sleeve called a foil (commonly referred to as a &quot;capsule&quot;) covering the top of the bottle, the purpose of which is to protect the cork from being gnawed away by rodents or infested with the cork weevil and to serve as collar to catch small drips when pouring. The foil also serves as a decorative element of the bottle&#x27;s label. Foils were historically made of lead, but research showed that trace amounts of toxic lead could remain on the lip of the bottle and mix with the poured wine, so lead foil wrapping was slowly phased out, and by the 1990s, most foils were made of tin, heat-shrink plastic (polyethylene, PVC), aluminium or polylaminate aluminium.

Sealing wax is sometimes used, or the foil can be omitted entirely. In the US, the FDA officially banned lead foils on domestic and imported wine bottles as of 1996.

Some bottles of wine have a paper strip beneath the foil, as a seal of authenticity, which must be broken before the bottle can be uncorked. Bottles of high-end Rioja wine may have a covering of gold wire netting, Spaniard Camilo Hurtado de Amézaga, Marqués de Riscal founded a winery in Rioja, in 1858, naming it after his own noble title, which had been created in 1708 by Philip V. He produced award-winning wines which became the preferred wines of King Alfonso XII. Camilo Hurtado de Amézaga invented a wire netting that covered his bottle, thereby preventing counterfeiters from substituting the wine, since it was impossible to remove the netting without breaking it. Modern day bottles of Rioja carry a much finer wire netting as a decoration.

==Punts==
A punt, also known as a kick-up, is the dimple at the bottom of a wine bottle. There is no consensus explanation for its purpose. The more commonly cited explanations include:

* It is a historical remnant from the era when wine bottles were free blown using a blowpipe and pontil. This technique leaves a punt mark on the base of the bottle; by indenting the point where the pontil is attached, this scar would not scratch the table or make the bottle unstable.
* It had the function of making the bottle less likely to topple over—a bottle designed with a flat bottom only needs a small imperfection to make it unstable—the dimple historically allowed for a larger margin of error.
* It consolidates sediment deposits in a thick ring at the bottom of the bottle, preventing much/most of it from being poured into the glass; this may be a more historical than functional attribute since most modern wines contain little or no sediment.
* It increases the strength of the bottle, allowing it to hold the high pressure of sparkling wine/champagne.
* It provides a grip for riddling a bottle of sparkling wine manually in the traditional champagne production process.
* It consumes some volume of the bottle, allowing the bottle to appear larger for the same amount of wine, which may impress the purchaser.
* In folklore, taverns had a steel pin set vertically in the bar. The empty bottle would be thrust bottom-end down onto this pin, puncturing a hole in the top of the punt, guaranteeing the bottle could not be refilled.
* It prevents the bottle from resonating as easily, decreasing the likelihood of shattering during transportation.
* It allows bottles to be more easily stacked end to end.
* Bottles could be stacked in cargo holds on ships without rolling around and breaking.
* It makes the bottle easier to clean prior to filling with wine. When a stream of water is injected into the bottle and impacts the punt, it is distributed throughout the bottom of the bottle and removes residues.

==Environmental impact==
Glass retains its color on recycling, and the United Kingdom has a large surplus of green glass because it imports a large quantity of wine but produces very little. Annually 1.4 million tons are sent to landfill.

Glass is a relatively heavy packing material and wine bottles use quite thick glass, so the tare weight of a full wine bottle is a relatively high proportion of its gross weight. The average weight of an empty 750 mL wine bottle is 500 g (and can range from 300 to 900 g), which makes the glass 40% of the total weight of the full bottle. This has led to suggestions that wine should be exported in bulk from producer regions and bottled close to the market. This would reduce the cost of transportation and its carbon footprint, and provide a local market for recycled green glass.

Less radically, boxed wine is sold in large, light-weight, foil-lined cardboard containers, though its use has been restricted to cheaper products in the past and as such retains a stigma. Following declining sales of wine boxes in the UK, in 2009 the Office for National Statistics removed them from its Consumer Price Index measure of inflation. Some wine producers are exploring more alternative packagings such as plastic bottles and tetra packs.

<text>Charles Joseph Watters (January 17, 1927 – November 19, 1967) was a chaplain (major) in the United States Army and Roman Catholic priest. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for bravery exhibited while rescuing wounded men in the Vietnam War&#x27;s Battle of Dak To.

Born in 1927, Watters joined the Air National Guard in 1962. He left the Guard in 1964 to join the Chaplain Corps, and embarked on his first tour in Vietnam, taking part in Operation Junction City and earning medals during the tour. On an extension of his tour, during the Battle of Dak To, Watters rescued many wounded men from enemy fire, but was killed by a friendly bomb strike from an American bomber.

==Biography==
Charles Joseph Watters was born on January 17, 1927, in Jersey City, New Jersey. Watters attended Seton Hall Preparatory School and went on to graduate from Seton Hall University. He was ordained as a priest in 1953 for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark and served in parishes in Jersey City, Rutherford, Paramus, and Cranford, New Jersey.

Watters was an active private pilot, flying small single-engine planes as far as Argentina. In 1962, Watters became a chaplain with the New Jersey Air National Guard. In 1964, he entered active duty as a chaplain with the U.S. Army. He began his first 12-month tour of duty in Vietnam on July 5, 1966. During his first tour, he was awarded the Air Medal and a Bronze Star for Valor. At the end of his first twelve months, in July 1967, he voluntarily extended his tour for an additional six months.

Chaplain Watters also made the parachute drop in Operation Junction City on 22 February 1967.
On November 19, 1967, Chaplain Watters&#x27; unit was involved in close combat with the enemy in the vicinity of Đắk Tô. For his &quot;conspicuous gallantry ... unyielding perseverance and selfless devotion to his comrades&quot; on that day, Chaplain Watters was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor by Vice President Spiro Agnew in a ceremony that also honored John Andrew Barnes III and Robert F. Stryker. Watters is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

==Medal of Honor citation==
The President of the United States in the name of The Congress takes pleasure in presenting the Medal of Honor to
For conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty. Chaplain Watters distinguished himself during an assault in the vicinity of Đắk Tô. Chaplain Watters was moving with one of the companies when it engaged a heavily armed enemy battalion. As the battle raged and the casualties mounted, Chaplain Watters, with complete disregard for his safety, rushed forward to the line of contact. Unarmed and completely exposed, he moved among, as well as in front of the advancing troops, giving aid to the wounded, assisting in their evacuation, giving words of encouragement, and administering the last rites to the dying. When a wounded paratrooper was standing in shock in front of the assaulting forces, Chaplain Watters ran forward, picked the man up on his shoulders and carried him to safety. As the troopers battled to the first enemy entrenchment, Chaplain Watters ran through the intense enemy fire to the front of the entrenchment to aid a fallen comrade. A short time later, the paratroopers pulled back in preparation for a second assault. Chaplain Watters exposed himself to both friendly and enemy fire between the two forces in order to recover two wounded soldiers. Later, when the battalion was forced to pull back into a perimeter, Chaplain Watters noticed that several wounded soldiers were lying outside the newly formed perimeter. Without hesitation and ignoring attempts to restrain him, Chaplain Watters left the perimeter three times in the face of small arms, automatic weapons, and mortar fire to carry and to assist the injured troopers to safety. Satisfied that all of the wounded were inside the perimeter, he began aiding the medics ... applying field bandages to open wounds, obtaining and serving food and water, giving spiritual and mental strength and comfort. During his ministering, he moved out to the perimeter from position to position redistributing food and water, and tending to the needs of his men. Chaplain Watters was giving aid to the wounded when he himself was mortally wounded. Chaplain Watters&#x27; unyielding perseverance and selfless devotion to his comrades was in keeping with the highest traditions of the U.S. Army.

<doc id="372949" wikidata="Q1105430" url="?curid=372949" title="Cocobolo">
<text>Cocobolo is a tropical hardwood of Central American trees belonging to the genus &quot;Dalbergia&quot;. Only the heartwood of cocobolo is used; it is usually orange or reddish-brown, often with darker irregular traces weaving through the wood. The heartwood changes color after being cut and can be polished to a lustrous, glassy finish. Being quite dense and sometimes having a relative density of over 1.0, it will sink in water. The sapwood (not often used) is a creamy yellow with a sharp boundary between it and the heartwood.

==Provenance==
Cocobolo is yielded by two to four closely related species of the genus &quot;Dalbergia&quot;, of which the best known is &quot;Dalbergia retusa&quot;, a fair-sized tree, reported to reach in height and in diameter; it probably is the species contributing most of the wood in the trade. Because of the high value of the timber, the trees yielding it have been heavily exploited, so they have become rare outside of national parks, reserves, and plantations. Only small amounts of this prized wood reach the world market, and it is expensive.

==Oil content==
Cocobolo heartwood contains oil, which lends a strong, unmistakable floral odor even to well seasoned wood and occasionally stains the hands with prolonged exposure. The high natural oil content of the wood makes it difficult to achieve a strong glue joint, as in applying veneers or guitar fingerboards, and can inhibit the curing of some varnishes, particularly oil-based finishes. Acetone may be used to remove surface oils before gluing. The oil can induce allergic reactions if inhaled or exposed to unprotected skin and eyes. This is due to the presence of allergenic chemicals such as S-4&#x27;-hydroxy-4-methoxy dalbergione, R-4-methoxy dalbergione, and other quinones and phenols. A dust collection system, coupled with the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators, is highly recommended when machining this wood.

==Uses==
Because it stands up well to repeated handling and exposure to water, a common use is for gun grips and knife handles, and duck calls. It is very hard, fine textured, and dense, yet easily machined. The abundance of natural oils, however, causes the wood to clog abrasives and fine-toothed saw blades, like other hard, dense tropical woods. Besides its use on guns and knives, cocobolo is favored for fine inlay work on custom, high-end cue sticks, police batons, pens, brush backs, bowls, pipes, jewelry boxes, desktops and other expensive specialty items.

==Musical instruments==
Due to its density and hardness, even a large block of the cut wood will produce a clear musical tone if struck. Renowned for its &quot;warm, rich palette&quot;, cocobolo is used to make musical instruments, such as oboes, flutes and clarinets--especially boutique, custom barrel joints for B-flat clarinets. Other woodwind instruments, such as bagpipes (as well as the chanters of bagpipes&#x27; more basic relatives, duck and goose calls), have been successfully made using cocobolo instead of the orchestral and Celtic instruments&#x27; customary mpingo, or African blackwood, known in the trade as grenadilla. Additionally, cocobolo has been used to make fingerboards, as well as entire necks and bodies of guitars and bass guitars, having been employed as a substitute for Brazilian Rosewood since that fellow Dalbergia member was CITES listed in 1992. Additionally, cocobolo is used to an extent in building drums.

==Conservation==
Logs, sawn wood, and veneer sheets from the Guatemalan populations of Cocobolo (&quot;Dalbergia retusa&quot;), have been listed under CITES Appendix III since 2008. In 2011, Panama extended that listing to include all products except seeds and pollen and finished products packaged and ready for retail trade. 

As of January 2, 2017, Cocobolo is protected as a CITES Appendix II species, along with Bubinga (Guibourtia demeusei, G. pellegriniana, and G. tessmanni), other true rosewoods (Dalbergia spp.) and related species found in the Dalbergia genus, such as Tulipwood, Kingwood, and African Blackwood.

==In popular culture==
* Paraguayan cocobolo was closely associated with David Woodard&#x27;s iteration of the Dreamachine.
* Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s 2013 film &quot;Only Lovers Left Alive&quot; features a bullet fashioned from cocobolo and brass. 
* One plotline in the television show &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; revolves around the acquisition of a cocobolo desk.
* A cocobolo log plays a prominent role in the &quot;Dead Moon Walking Adventure&quot; episode of &quot;The Great North&quot;.

<text>Warwick is a German bass guitar manufacturing company. Warwick basses were originally a premium brand offering a small range of models built from high quality and exotic tonewoods. The company also produces valve and FET amplifiers, speaker cabinets, bass guitar strings, and is the owner of the Framus trademark. Their headquarters and custom shops are located in Markneukirchen, Shanghai, and Nashville.

==History==

Warwick was founded in 1982 in Erlangen, in the German state of Bavaria, by Hans-Peter Wilfer. In 1995 the company moved to Markneukirchen in the Saxon Vogtland to capitalize on the centuries-old tradition of instrument building in the region and to reopen the Framus trademark. In addition, the company has developed an extensive distribution network throughout Germany and Austria to represent and distribute products from musical instruments and equipment companies from Europe and the United States.

==Company specifics==

===Environmental protection===
Warwick produces its instruments and amplifiers using carbon-neutral principles. Any other manufacturing process is carbon-neutral as well. The company is purchasing its wood from sustainable sources (certified by the Forest Stewardship Council) and produces all the electricity it needs through its own natural-gas-powered plant, solar roof-mounted facilities, a boiler fueled by wood waste from its guitars and wind power.

Warwick is operating according to the guidelines of European Unions Eco-Management and Audit Scheme, which is a voluntary environmental management instrument designed to continuously improve companies&#x27; environmental performance.

===Training courses===
In the past, the company hosted the &quot;Warwick Bass Camp&quot;, where participants from all over the world were given the opportunity to join training courses and learn from notable bass players such as Victor Wooten, John Patitucci, Lee Sklar, Stuart Hamm, Alphonso Johnson, Dave Ellefson, Hellmut Hattler, Ryan Martinie or Gary Willis.

===Custom Shop / Masterbuilt models===
Warwick produces a variety of different models with different woods and electronics. The original series, which are manufactured in Germany, include the Corvette, Streamer, Thumb SC, and Dolphin. The only model in the original catalog made outside of Germany is the Alien acoustic bass, built in Korea.

====Limited Editions====

In 2001, Warwick began making Limited Edition instruments; every year, distinctive features are added to one production model, and built in limited quantities, starting with the Thumb BO Bass. Upgrades include exotic woods, different pickups and electronic configurations, and custom finishes.

As well, there are around forty Special Edition bass models in production. These basses are usually upgraded versions of standard models that have features otherwise unavailable.

Examples include the Thumb BO (ovangkol neck and body back and bubinga pommele top, with 2mm of swamp ash laminated between, and ebony fretboard; 150 built for 2001) and the FNA Jazzman in walnut and swirly bubinga (200 built for 2002).

==== Signature Series ====

In 2019, Warwick produced 13 models of signature bass. Present and past models have included those for Jack Bruce (Cream), Bootsy Collins, T.M. Stevens, Robert Trujillo (Metallica), Jonas Hellborg, Adam Clayton (U2), John Entwistle (The Who) and Jäcki Reznicek (Silly).

P-Nut of 311 has three signature basses, all Streamer models.

The Stuart Zender (Jamiroquai) signature bass is designed by Zender, and features a body shape new to Warwick basses.

Warwick also built custom fretless seven-string Thumb NT basses for Jeroen Paul Thesseling.

===Pro Series (Teambuilt)===
The Pro Series instruments are crafted in the same German factory as the Custom Shop models. Fewer unusual woods are employed, and options for finish and hardware are more limited, keeping pricing lower. Models include the Corvette, Streamer, Thumb, and Star bass.

===RockBass (&quot;Standard&quot;)===
Consumer-level RockBass models are made in China, using less exotic woods and simpler finishes. These basses are the Streamer, Corvette, Fortress, Vampyre, Star Bass, Triumph, and Alien acoustic; the Rockbass Alien is the only Rockbass model that looks different from the original.

====RockBass Artist Line====
The RockBass Artist Line produces affordable signature models, also made in China. These include the Robert Trujillo four- and five-string; the Bootsy Collins SpaceBass; the Steve Bailey four-, five-, and six-string; the P-Nut four- and five-string; and the Jack Bruce and Adam Clayton models.

<doc id="372958" wikidata="Q1530993" url="?curid=372958" title="Glengarriff">
<text>Glengarriff () is a village of approximately 140 people on the N71 national secondary road in the Beara Peninsula of County Cork, Ireland. Known internationally as a tourism venue, it has a number of natural attractions. It sits at the northern head of Glengarriff Bay, a smaller enclave of Bantry Bay.

At northwards along the N71 road from Bantry, and eastwards along the R572 road Castletownbere, it is a common stopping-point along the routes around the area.

==Economy==
Primarily, the economy revolves around a combination of tourism, farming and local services.

==Attractions==
Glengarriff is a small seaside village on the Ring of Beara surrounded by high rugged mountains pocked with old bogs being farmed for peat. Local tourist sites include the Italian Gardens on Garnish Island (Ilnacullin), which may be visited by boat trip. Offering a broad view of the surrounding area, the round Martello tower on the island was built to guard against a threatened Napoleonic invasion that never materialized.
In the nearby Glengarriff Forest is the glen that gave Glengarriff its name, (loosely translated as &quot;rough glen&quot;) containing some of the oldest and most extensive oak and birch groves left in Ireland. A short but steep trail leads up to Lady Bantry&#x27;s Lookout, which has views over Glengarriff and the west Cork area. Other tourist amenities include the Bamboo Park, behind Toad Hall, a local amenity area featuring a child&#x27;s playground and Blue Pool lagoon, the nearby Barley Lake and the historic Eccles Hotel. Walking trails in the area are extensive, kayaking on the bay is regularly scheduled, and live music is played at local pubs, particularly during the tourist season. Glengarriff also has several shops, pubs, restaurants and other services.

Glengarriff harbour is a sheltered anchorage and has visitors moorings for visiting yachts.

Glengarriff has an annual music festival, the Jim Dowling Uilleann Pipe &amp; Trad Festival, which takes in June and focuses on uilleann piping.

==Sport==
Glengarriff Golf Club is a nine-hole course on the east side of the village. It is associated with the late Maureen O&#x27;Hara, the film actress, who had a home nearby.

Glengarriff GAA Club was founded in 1981 after breaking away from neighbouring Adrigole GFC. It fields Gaelic football teams from Junior ‘A’ level to Under 6s. Teams compete in leagues and championships run by the Beara GAA division.

== Notable inhabitants==
* John Annan Bryce (1841–1923), British businessman and politician who purchased Garnish Island in 1910.
* Maureen O&#x27;Hara (1920–2015), Irish-American actress, had a home in the area

==Cultural references==
Letitia Elizabeth Landon&#x27;s poetical illustration, &quot;Glengariffe&quot; in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1833, accompanies an engraving of a view painted by William Henry Bartlett over Garnish Island looking towards the mountains in the West.

<doc id="372960" wikidata="Q6866275" url="?curid=372960" title="Minister of Pensions and National Health (Canada)">
<text>Minister of Pensions and National Health was an office in the Cabinet of Canada from 1928 to 1944 who oversaw the Department of Pensions and National Health.

Prior to 1928, certain responsibilities of the Pensions and National Health portfolio were carried out by the now-defunct post of Minister of Soldiers&#x27; Civil Re-establishment. That office, along with &quot;The Department of Health Act&quot;, were abolished and the office of Minister of Pensions and National Health was created on 1928 June 11 by Statute 18-19 George V, c. 39.

In 1944, the portfolio was divided to create the posts of Minister of National Health and Welfare and Minister of Veterans Affairs.

== History ==
Before 1872, the Department of Agriculture was responsible for public health across Canada. After that, the responsibility was divided among the Department of Marines and Fisheries, Agriculture, and Inland Revenue. The department of Finance and the Commission of Conservation were responsible for addressing tuberculosis, while a National Council of Health operated under the Commission of Conservation for other public health matters. Given the division of responsibility, The Canadian Medical Association and The Canadian Public Health Association to repeatedly urge the government to establish a Department of Health. Over the years, various public organizations, especially women&#x27;s societies, presented petitions to the Government requesting the creation of the Department. In 1919, the Department of health was finally created with specific responsibilities and powers assigned to its branches.

<doc id="372962" wikidata="Q2328925" url="?curid=372962" title="Societal attitudes toward homosexuality">
<text>Societal attitudes toward homosexuality vary greatly across different cultures and historical periods, as do attitudes toward sexual desire, activity and relationships in general. All cultures have their own values regarding appropriate and inappropriate sexuality; some sanction same-sex love and sexuality, while others may disapprove of such activities in part. As with heterosexual behaviour, different sets of prescriptions and proscriptions may be given to individuals according to their gender, age, social status or social class.

Many of the world&#x27;s cultures have, in the past, considered procreative sex within a recognized relationship to be a sexual norm—sometimes exclusively so, and sometimes alongside norms of same-sex love, whether passionate, intimate or sexual. Some sects within some religions, especially those influenced by the Abrahamic tradition, have censured homosexual acts and relationships at various times, in some cases implementing severe punishments. Homophobic attitudes in society can manifest themselves in the form of anti-LGBT discrimination, opposition to LGBT rights, anti-LGBT hate speech, and violence against LGBT people.

Since the 1970s, much of the world has become more accepting of homosexual acts and relationships. Cross-national differences in acceptance can be explained by three factors: the strength of democratic institutions, the level of economic development, and the religious context of the places where people live. The Pew Research Center&#x27;s 2013 Global Attitudes Survey &quot;finds broad acceptance of homosexuality in North America, the European Union, and much of Latin America, but equally widespread rejection in predominantly Muslim nations and in Africa, as well as in parts of Asia and in Russia&quot;. The survey also finds &quot;acceptance of homosexuality is particularly widespread in countries where religion is less central in people&#x27;s lives. These are also among the richest countries in the world. In contrast, in poorer countries with high levels of religiosity, few believe homosexuality should be accepted by society. Age is also a factor in several countries, with younger respondents offering far more tolerant views than older ones. And while gender differences are not prevalent, in those countries where they are, women are consistently more accepting of homosexuality than men.&quot;

==Difficulties in interpreting homosexuality==
Contemporary scholars caution against applying modern Western assumptions about sex and gender to other times and places; what looks like same-sex sexuality to a Western observer may not be &quot;same-sex&quot; or &quot;sexual&quot; at all to the people engaging in such behaviour. For example, in the Bugis cultures of Sulawesi, a female who dresses and works in a masculine fashion and marries a woman is seen as belonging to a third gender; to the Bugis, their relationship is not homosexual (see sexual orientation and gender identity). In the case of &#x27;Sambia&#x27; (a pseudonym) boys in New Guinea who ingest the semen of older males to aid in their maturation, it is disputed whether this is best understood as a sexual act at all. Some scholars have argued that notions of a homosexual and heterosexual identity, as they are currently known in the Western world, only began to emerge in Europe in the mid to late 19th century, though others challenge this. Behaviors that today would be widely regarded as homosexual, at least in the West, enjoyed a degree of acceptance in around three-quarters of the cultures surveyed in &quot;Patterns of Sexual Behavior&quot; (1951).

==Measuring attitudes toward homosexuality==

From the 1970s, academics have researched attitudes held by individuals toward lesbians, gay men and bisexuals, and the social and cultural factors that underlie such attitudes. Numerous studies have investigated the prevalence of acceptance and disapproval of homosexuality, and have consistently found correlates with various demographic, psychological, and social variables. For example, studies (mainly conducted in the United States) have found that heterosexuals with positive attitudes towards homosexuality are more likely to be female, white, young, non-religious, well-educated, politically liberal or moderate, and have close personal contact with homosexuals who are out. They are also more likely to have positive attitudes towards other minority groups and are less likely to support traditional gender roles. Several studies have also suggested that heterosexual females&#x27; attitudes towards gay men are similar to those towards lesbians, and some (but not all) have found that heterosexual males have a more positive attitude toward lesbians. Herek (1984) found that heterosexual females tended to exhibit equally positive or negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. The heterosexual males, however, tended to respond more negatively, or unfavorably, to gay men than lesbians.

Social psychologists such as Gregory Herek have examined underlying motivations for homophobia (hostility toward lesbians and gays), and cultural theorists have noted how portrayals of homosexuality often center around stigmatized phenomena such as AIDS, pedophilia, and gender variance. The extent to which such portrayals are stereotypes is disputed.

Contemporary researchers have measured attitudes held by heterosexuals toward gay men and lesbians in a number of different ways.

Certain populations are also found to accept homosexuality more than others. In the United States, African-Americans are generally less tolerant of homosexuality than European or Hispanic Americans. However, polls after President Barack Obama&#x27;s public support of same-sex marriage showed a shift in attitudes to 59% support among African Americans, 60% among Latinos and 50 percent among White Americans. Israelis were found to be the most accepting of homosexuality among Middle Eastern nations and Israeli laws and culture reflect that. According to a 2007 poll, a strong majority of Israeli Jews say they would accept a gay child and go on with life as usual. A 2013 &quot;Haaretz&quot; poll found that most of the Arab and Haredi sector saw homosexuality negatively, while the majority of secular and traditional Jews say they support equal rights for gay couples.

Much less research has been conducted into societal attitudes toward bisexuality. What studies do exist suggest that the attitude of heterosexuals toward bisexuals mirrors their attitude toward homosexuals, and that bisexuals experience a similar degree of hostility, discrimination, and violence relating to their sexual orientation as do homosexuals.

Research (mainly conducted in the United States) show that people with more permissive attitudes on sexual orientation issues tend to be younger, well-educated, and politically liberal. Tolerance toward homosexuality and bisexuality have been increasing with time. A 2011 Public Policy Polling survey found that 48 percent of voters in the state of Delaware supported the legalization of same-sex marriage, while 47 were opposed and 5 percent were not sure. A 2011 poll by Lake Research Partners showed that 62% in Delaware favored allowing same-sex couples to form civil unions, while 31% were opposed, and 7% were not sure.

==Law==

The legal status of homosexuality varies greatly around the world. Homosexual acts between consenting adults are known to be illegal in about 70 out of the 195 countries of the world.

Homosexual sex acts may be illegal, especially under sodomy laws, and where they are legal, the age of consent often differs from country to country. In some cases, homosexuals are prosecuted under vaguely worded &quot;public decency&quot; or morality laws. Some countries have special laws preventing certain public expressions of homosexuality. Nations or subnational entities may have anti-discrimination legislation in place to protect against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in the workplace, housing, health services and education. Some give exemptions, allowing employers to discriminate if they are a religious organisation, or if the employee works with children.
Legal recognition of same-sex relationships also varies greatly. Legal privileges pertaining to different-sex relationships that may be extended to same-sex couples include parenting, adoption and access to reproductive technologies; immigration; spousal benefits for employees such as pensions, health funds and other services; family leave; medical rights, including hospital visitation, notification and power of attorney; inheritance when a partner dies without leaving a will; and social security and tax benefits. Same-sex couples without legal recognition may also lack access to domestic violence services, as well as mediation and arbitration over custody and property when relationships end. Some regions have laws specifically excluding same-sex couples from particular rights such as adoption.

In 2001, the Netherlands became the first country to recognize same-sex marriage. Since then same-sex marriages were subsequently recognized in Belgium (2003), Spain (2005), Canada (2005), South Africa (2006), Norway (2009), Sweden (2009), Portugal (2010), Iceland (2010), Argentina (2010), Denmark (2012), Brazil (2013), France (2013), Uruguay (2013), New Zealand (2013), Luxembourg (2015), Ireland (2015), the United States (2015), Colombia (2016), Finland (2017), Germany (2017), Australia (2017), Austria (2019), Taiwan (2019), Ecuador (2019), United Kingdom (2020), Costa Rica (2020), Chile (2022), Switzerland (2022), Slovenia (2022), Cuba (2022), Mexico (2022), Andorra (2023), Estonia (2024), Greece 
(2024), Liechtenstein (2025) and Thailand (2025). Israel, legally recognizes same-sex marriages, but does not allow such marriages to be performed within the country.

===Islamic law===

On the other end of the spectrum, several countries impose the death penalty for homosexual acts, per the application of some interpretations of Shari&#x27;a law. As of 2022, these include Afghanistan, Mauritania, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and northern Nigeria.

In Saudi Arabia, the maximum punishment for homosexuality is public execution. However, the government will use other punishments – e.g., fines, jail time, and whipping – as alternatives, unless it feels that homosexuals are challenging state authority by engaging in LGBT social movements.

Most international human rights organizations, such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, condemn laws that make homosexual relations between consenting adults a crime. Since 1994, the United Nations Human Rights Committee has also ruled that such laws violate the right to privacy guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

Of the nations with a majority of Muslim inhabitants, many, even those with secular constitutions, continue to outlaw homosexuality, though only in a minority (Yemen and Afghanistan) is it punishable by death. Of the countries where homosexuality is illegal, only Lebanon has an internal effort to legalize it. Muslim-majority countries where homosexuality is not criminalized include Albania, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkey, Kosovo and others.

==Religion==

As with social attitudes in general, religious attitudes towards homosexuality vary between and among religions and their adherents. Traditionalists among the world&#x27;s major religions generally disapprove of homosexuality, and prominent opponents of social acceptance of homosexuality often cite religious arguments to support their views. Liberal currents also exist within most religions, and modern lesbian and gay scholars of religion sometimes point to a place for homosexuality among historical traditions and scriptures, and emphasise religious teachings of compassion and love.

Abrahamic religions such as Judaism, Islam, and various denominations of Christianity traditionally forbid sexual relations between people of the same sex and teach that such behaviour is sinful. Religious authorities point to passages in the Qur&#x27;an, the Old Testament and the New Testament for scriptural justification of these beliefs.

Among the Sinic religions of East Asia, including Confucianism, Chinese folk religion and Taoism, passionate homosexual expression is usually discouraged because it is believed to not lead to human fulfillment.

==Corporate attitudes==

In some capitalist countries, large private sector firms often lead the way in the equal treatment of gay men and lesbians. For instance, more than half of the Fortune 500 offer domestic partnership benefits and 49 of the Fortune 50 companies include sexual orientation in their non-discrimination policies (only ExxonMobil does not). At the same time, studies show that many private firms engage in significant employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. In one study, for example, two fictitious but realistic resumes were sent to roughly 1,700 entry-level job openings. The two resumes were very similar in terms of the applicant&#x27;s qualifications, but one resume for each opening mentioned that the applicant had been part of a gay organization in college. The results showed that applicants without the gay signal had an 11.5 percent chance of being called for an interview; openly gay applicants had only a 7.2 percent chance. The callback gap varied widely according to the location of the job. Most of the overall gap detected in the study was driven by the Southern and Midwestern states in the sample—Texas, Florida, and Ohio. The Western and Northeastern states in the sample (California, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and New York) had only small and statistically insignificant callback gaps.

In the Western world, in particular the United States and the United Kingdom, the corporatisation of LGBT pride parades has been criticised by some.

==Anti-homosexual attitudes==
===Conservatism===
Conservatism is a term broadly used for people who are inclined to traditional values.

While conservatism includes people of many views, a significant proportion of its adherents consider homosexuals, and especially the efforts of homosexuals to achieve certain rights and recognition, to be a threat to valued traditions, institutions and freedoms. Such attitudes are generally tied in with opposition to what some conservatives call the &quot;homosexual agenda&quot;.

The finding that attitudes to alternative sexualities correlate strongly with nature of contact and with personal beliefs is stated in a variety of research over a substantial time period, and conservative men and women stand out in their views specifically.

Thus Herek, who established the Attitudes Toward Lesbians and Gay Men Scale in psychology, states:
The ATLG and its subscales are consistently correlated with other theoretically relevant constructs. Higher scores (more negative attitudes) correlate significantly with high religiosity, lack of contact with gay men and lesbians, adherence to traditional sex-role attitudes, belief in a traditional family ideology, and high levels of dogmatism
and that:
The strongest predictor of positive attitudes toward homosexuals was that the interviewee knew a gay man or lesbian. The correlation held across each demographic subset represented in the survey—sex, education level, age—bar one: political persuasion.

An example of conservative views can also be found in the discussion of what conservatives call &quot;homosexual recruitment&quot;, within a document released by the conservative Christian organization Alliance Defense Fund states:
The homosexual activist movement are driving an agenda that will severely limit the ability to live and practice the Gospel, whether it is in the boardroom, the classroom, halls of government, private organizations, and even in places of worship. In their relentless attempts to obtain special rights, that no other special interest group has, they are in the process of redefining the family, demanding not only &#x27;tolerance&#x27; ... but &#x27;acceptance&#x27;, and ultimately seeking to marginalize, censor, and punish those individuals who stand in the way of their multiple goals.

As this statement illustrates, those who believe that a disapproving attitude toward homosexuality is a tenet of their religion can see efforts to abolish such attitudes as an attack on their religious freedom. Those who regard homosexuality as a sin or perversion can believe that acceptance of homosexual parents and same-sex marriage will redefine and diminish the institutions of family and marriage.

More generally, conservatives—by definition—prefer that institutions, traditions and values remain unchanged, and this has put many of them in opposition to efforts designed to increase the cultural acceptance and legal rights of homosexuals.

===Psychology and sexual orientation===

In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association&#x27;s board of trustees voted to declassify homosexuality as a mental disorder in the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM). Though some criticized this as a political decision, the social and political impetus for change was supported by scientific evidence. In fact, the research of Evelyn Hooker and other psychologists and psychiatrists helped to end the notion that homosexuality was in and of itself a mental illness. Homosexuality in and of itself was removed from the DSM in 1974, but a diagnosis of distress related to one&#x27;s sexual orientation remained in the manual until 2013 (DSM-5). In parallel fashion, the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from the &quot;International Classification of Diseases&quot; (ICD) in the tenth edition of that manual in 1992 (ICD-10), but retained a diagnosis of distress related to one&#x27;s sexual orientation until 2019 (ICD-11). Diagnosing a person with a medical or mental health condition on the basis of sexual orientation is no longer allowable under either of these leading diagnostic manuals.

Many religious groups and other advocates, like National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality (NARTH), believe that they can &quot;heal&quot; or &quot;cure&quot; homosexuality through conversion therapy or other methods to change sexual orientation. In a survey of 882 people who were undergoing conversion therapy, attending &quot;ex-gay&quot; groups or &quot;ex-gay&quot; conferences, 22.9% reported they had not undergone any changes, 42.7% reported some changes, and 34.3% reported much change in sexual orientation. Many Western health and mental health professional organizations believe sexual orientation develops across a person&#x27;s lifetime, but that this therapy is unnecessary, potentially harmful, and the effectiveness has not been rigorously and scientifically proven. Much attention was given to the dissent from this opinion by Robert Spitzer, but he later realized that his research was flawed and apologized for the damage it may have done. Another study refuting the claims of conversion therapy proponents was done in 2001 by Ariel Shidlo and Michael Schroeder, which showed only 3% of the participants claiming to have completely changed their orientation from gay to straight.

In many non-Western post-colonial countries, homosexual orientation is still considered to be a mental disorder and illness. In Muslim areas, this position is ascribed to the earlier adoption of European Victorian attitudes by the westernized elite, in areas where previously native traditions embraced same-sex relations.

===Blame for plagues and disasters===
The destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah as takes place in the Bible is sometimes attributed to attempted homosexual rape, but this is disputed and differs from earlier beliefs. Early Jewish belief (and some Jews today) variously attributed the destruction to turning a blind eye to social injustice or lack of hospitality.

Since the Middle Ages, sodomites were blamed for &quot;bringing down the wrath of God&quot; upon the land, and their pleasures blamed for the periodic epidemics of disease which decimated the population. This &quot;pollution&quot; was thought to be cleansed by fire, as a result of which countless individuals were burned at the stake or run through with white-hot iron rods.

Since the end of the 1980s similar accusations have been made, inspired by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, with preachers such as Jerry Falwell blaming both the victim and a supposedly tolerant societal view of homosexuality. Recent researches indicate that in the years since, the epidemic has spread and now has many more heterosexual victims than homosexual.

=== Association with child sexual abuse and pedophilia===
Some people fear exposing their children to homosexuals in unsupervised settings because they believe the children might be molested, raped, or &quot;recruited&quot; to be homosexuals themselves. The publicity surrounding the Roman Catholic sex abuse cases has heightened these concerns. Many organizations focus on these concerns, drawing connections between homosexuality and pedophilia. According to the John Jay Report, a study commissioned by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops under the auspices of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and an all-lay review board headed by Illinois Appellate Court Justice Anne M. Burke, &quot;81% of the reported victims of child sexual abuse by Catholic clergy were boys.&quot; The review board went on to conclude that, &quot;the crisis was characterized by homosexual behavior&quot;, and in light of this, &quot;the current crisis cannot be addressed without consideration of issues related to homosexuality.&quot; According to Margaret Smith, one of John Jay&#x27;s researchers, however, it is &quot;an unwarranted conclusion&quot; to assert that the majority of priests who abused male victims are gay. Though &quot;the majority of the abusive acts were homosexual in nature ... participation in homosexual acts is not the same as sexual identity as a gay man.&quot; Psychology professor Gregory Herek also analyzed a number of studies and found no relationship between sexual orientation and molestation. One of her fellow researchers, Louis Schlesinger, argued that the main problem was pedophilia or ephebophilia, not sexual orientation and said that some men who are married to adult women are attracted to adolescent males.

Small-scale studies by Carole Jenny, A.W. Richard Sipe, and others have not found evidence that homosexuals are more likely to molest children than heterosexuals. Based on the responses of a sample of thousands of admitted child molesters, one study found that 70% of the sex offenders who targeted boys rated themselves as predominantly or exclusively heterosexual in adult orientation on the Kinsey scale, and only 8% as exclusively homosexual. Phallometric testing on community males shows that men with a preference for adult males (often called &quot;androphiles&quot; in these studies) are no more attracted to adolescent or younger boys than are men with a preference for adult females (or &quot;gynephiles&quot;). Conversely, sex offenders targeting boys—especially prepubescent boys—may be heterosexual, while others lack attraction to adults of either sex. Kurt Freund, analyzing sex offender samples, concluded that only rarely does a sex offender against male children have a preference for adult males; Frenzel and Lang (1989) also noticed a lack of androphiles in their phallometric analysis of 144 child sex offenders, which included 25 men who offended against underage boys. A study involving 21 adult sex offenders against boys found that two thirds of them had a sexual preference for women over men, as measured by the penile plethysmograph, with the larger, &quot;heterosexual&quot; subgroup targeting younger boys than the &quot;homosexual&quot; group. A more recent survey, which asked self-identified pedophiles in online communities to rate their sexual attraction to males and females from age 1 to age 18, found that those men disclosed very low levels of attraction towards more mature males, with the authors concluding that, &quot;[i]ntense sexual attraction to male children is distinct from, and not generally compatible with, intense sexual attraction to men.&quot;

Johns Hopkins University psychiatrist Frederick Berlin, who runs a treatment program for offenders, says it is flawed to assume that men who molest young boys are attracted to adult men; Berlin defines attraction to children as a separate orientation of its own. Psychotherapist A. W. Richard Sipe also argues that the sexual deprivation that occurs in the priesthood could lead one to turn to children and that boys are more accessible to priests and other male authority figures than girls. A study by A. Nicholas Groth found that nearly half of the child sex offenders in his small sample were exclusively attracted to children. The other half regressed to children after finding trouble in adult relationships. No one in his sample was primarily attracted to same-sex adults.

The empirical research shows that sexual orientation does not affect the likelihood that people will abuse children. Many child molesters cannot be characterized as having an adult sexual orientation at all; they are fixated on children.

Lawmakers and social commentators have sometimes expressed a concern that normalizing homosexuality would also lead to normalizing pedophilia, if it were determined that pedophilia too were a sexual orientation.

International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association
=== Opposition to &quot;promotion of homosexuality&quot;===

&quot;Promotion of homosexuality&quot; is a group of behaviors believed by some gay-rights opponents to be carried out in the mass media, public places, etc. The term &quot;gay propaganda&quot; may be used by others to allege similar behaviors, especially in relation to false accusations of homosexual recruitment and an alleged &quot;gay agenda&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, Section 28 of the 1988 Local Government Act banned &quot;promotion of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship&quot; by local government employees in the course of their duties. The act was aimed to prevent the &quot;promotion of homosexuality&quot; in schools. Prosecutions increased following the act. Section 28 was later repealed in Scotland on 21 June 2000 as one of the first pieces of legislation enacted by the new Scottish Parliament, and on 18 November 2003 in England and Wales by section 122 of the Local Government Act 2003, with the Labour government also issuing an apology to LGBT people for the act. ()

Lithuania put in place a similar such ban 16 June 2009 amid protests by gay rights groups. LGBT rights groups stated that it would be taken to the European Court of Human Rights for violation of European Human rights laws. Several Russian territories had implemented similar laws restricting the distribution of &quot;propaganda&quot; promoting homosexuality to minors, including Ryazan, Arkhangelsk, and Saint Petersburg. In June 2013, a federal bill was passed in Russia that made the distribution of materials promoting &quot;non-traditional sexual relationships&quot; among minors a criminal offence; the bill&#x27;s author Yelena Mizulina argued that the law was intended to help protect &quot;traditional family values&quot;.

===Violence===
Gay people have been the target of violence for their sexuality in various cultures throughout history. During the Holocaust, 100,000 gay men were arrested, and between 5,000 and 15,000 gay men perished in Nazi concentration camps. Violence against LGBT people continues to occur today, fueled by anti-gay rhetoric.

===Homophobic rhetoric===

==Regions and historical periods==
Societal attitudes toward homosexuality vary greatly in different cultures and different historical periods, as do attitudes toward sexual desire, activity and relationships in general. All cultures have their own values regarding appropriate and inappropriate sexuality; some sanction same-sex love and sexuality, while others disapprove of such activities. As with heterosexual behaviour, different sets of prescriptions and proscriptions may be given to individuals according to their gender, age, social status or class. For example, among the samurai class of pre-modern Japan, it was recommended for a teenage novice to enter into an erotic relationship with an older warrior (see Shudo), but sexual relations between the two became inappropriate once the boy came of age.

===Ancient India===
===Ancient Greece===


In Ancient Greece homoerotic practices were widely present, and integrated into the religion, education, philosophy and military culture. The sexualized form of these relationships was the topic of vigorous debate. In particular, anal intercourse was condemned by many, including Plato, as a form of hubris and faulted for dishonoring and feminizing the boys. Relations between adult males were generally ridiculed. Plato also believed that the chaste form of the relationship was the mark of an enlightened society, while only barbarians condemned it.

The extent to which the Greeks engaged in and tolerated homosexual relations is open to some debate. In Sparta and Thebes, there appeared to be a particularly strong emphasis on these relationships, and it was considered an important part of a youth&#x27;s education.

===Ancient Rome===
&quot;Homosexual&quot; and &quot;heterosexual&quot; were not categories of Roman sexuality, and Latin lacks words that would translate these concepts exactly. The primary dichotomy of Roman sexuality was active/dominant/masculine and passive/submissive/&quot;feminized&quot;. The masculinity of an adult male citizen was defined sexually by his taking the penetrative role, whether his partner was female or a male of lower status. A Roman citizen&#x27;s political liberty &quot;(libertas)&quot; was defined in part by the right to preserve his body from physical compulsion or use by others; for the male citizen to use his body to give pleasure was considered servile and subversive of the social hierarchy.

It was acceptable for a man to be attracted to a beautiful young male, but the bodies of citizen youths were strictly off-limits. Acceptable male partners were slaves, male prostitutes, or others who lacked social standing (the &quot;infames)&quot;. Same-sex relations among male citizens of equal status, including soldiers, were disparaged, and in some circumstances penalized harshly. In political rhetoric, a man might be attacked for effeminacy or playing the passive role in sex acts, but not for performing penetrative sex on a socially acceptable male partner. Threats of anal or oral rape against another man were forms of masculine braggadocio.

Homosexual behaviors were regulated in so far as they threatened or impinged on an ideal of liberty for the dominant male, who retained his masculinity by not being penetrated. The &quot;Lex Scantinia&quot; imposed penalties on those who committed a sex crime &quot;(stuprum)&quot; against a freeborn male minor; it may also have been used to prosecute adult male citizens who willingly took the &quot;passive&quot; role. Children who were born into slavery or became enslaved had no legal protections against sexual abuse; a good-looking and graceful slave-boy might be chosen and groomed as his owner&#x27;s sexual favorite. Pederasty in ancient Rome thus differed from pederastic practice in ancient Greece, where by custom the couple were both freeborn males of equal social status.

Although Roman law did not recognize marriage between men, and in general Romans regarded marriage as a heterosexual union with the primary purpose of producing children, in the early Imperial period some male couples were celebrating traditional marriage rites. Juvenal remarks that his friends often attended such ceremonies. The emperor Nero had two marriages to men, once as the bride (with a freedman Pythagoras) and once as the groom. He had his pederastic lover Sporus castrated, and during their marriage, Sporus appeared in public as Nero&#x27;s wife wearing the regalia that was customary for Roman empresses.

Same-sex relations among women are infrequently documented during the Republic and Principate, but better attested during the Empire. An early reference to homosexual women as &quot;lesbians&quot; is found in the Roman-era Greek writer Lucian (2nd century AD): &quot;They say there are women like that in Lesbos, masculine-looking, but they don&#x27;t want to give it up for men. Instead, they consort with women, just like men.&quot; Since male writers thought a sex act required an active or dominant partner who was &quot;phallic&quot;, they imagined that in lesbian sex one of the women would use a dildo or have an exceptionally large clitoris for penetration, and that she would be the one experiencing pleasure. The poet Martial describes lesbians as having outsized sexual appetites and performing penetrative sex on both women and boys. Satiric portrayals of women who sodomize boys, drink and eat like men, and engage in vigorous physical regimens, may reflect cultural anxieties about the growing independence of Roman women.

===Ancient China===

Some early Chinese emperors are speculated to have had homosexual relationships, accompanied by heterosexual ones. Same-sex practices have been documented there since the &quot;Spring and Autumn Annals&quot; period (parallel with Classical Greece) and its roots are found in the legend of China&#x27;s origin, the reign of the Yellow Emperor, who, among his many inventions, is credited with being the first to take male bedmates.

Opposition to homosexuality in China originates in the medieval Tang dynasty, attributed to the rising influence of Christian and Islamic values, but did not become fully established until the late Qing dynasty and the Republic of China. The Chinese Psychiatrists&#x27; Association removed homosexuality from the list of mental illnesses in April 2001. However, as openly gay scriptwriter and teacher Cui Zi&#x27;en points out, &quot;In the West, it&#x27;s frowned on to criticize homosexuals and even more to make them feel different&quot;, says Cui Zi&#x27;en, contrasting it with Chinese society which, &quot;is changing, but there&#x27;ll always be people who&#x27;ll feel disgust&quot;.

===Ancient Israel===
In the book of Leviticus, intercourse between males was condemned as an &#x27;abomination&#x27; (Leviticus 18:22, 22:13), and required the death penalty for those men who &quot;lie with a man as with a woman&quot;.

===Early Christianity===

Many contend that from its earliest days, Christianity followed the Hebrew tradition of condemnation of male sexual intercourse and certain forms of sexual relations between men and women, labeling both as &quot;sodomy&quot;. Some contemporary Christian scholars dispute this however. The teachings of Jesus Christ encouraged a turning away from and forgiveness of sin, including those sins of sexual impurity, although Jesus never referred to homosexuality specifically. Jesus was known as a defender of those whose sexual sins were condemned by the Pharisees. At the same time, Jesus strongly upheld the Ten Commandments and urged those whose sexual sins were forgiven to, &quot;go, and sin no more&quot;.

Saint Paul was even more explicit in his condemnation of sinful behavior, including sodomy, saying, &quot;Know you not that the unjust shall not possess the kingdom of God? Do not err: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor the effeminate, nor liers with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor extortioners, shall possess the kingdom of God.&quot; However, the exact meanings of two of the ancient Greek words that Paul used that supposedly refer to homosexuality are disputed among scholars. In the Septuagint translation of the Old Testament, however, the relevant words employed in 1 Corinthians and 1 Timothy are the same words employed in Leviticus 18 to denote gay men.

===Christian Roman Empire / Byzantine Empire===
After the emperor Constantine ended the persecution of Christians throughout the Roman Empire and Theodosius made Christianity the official state religion in the 4th century, Christian attitudes toward sexual behavior were soon incorporated into Roman Law. In the year 528, the emperor Justinian I, responding to an outbreak of pederasty among the Christian clergy, issued a law which made castration the punishment for sodomy.

===Medieval Europe===

In medieval Europe, homosexuality was considered sodomy and was punishable by death. Persecutions reached their height during the Medieval Inquisitions, when the sects of Cathars and Waldensians were accused of fornication and sodomy, alongside accusations of Satanism. In 1307, accusations of sodomy and homosexuality were major charges leveled during the Trial of the Knights Templar. The theologian Thomas Aquinas was influential in linking condemnations of homosexuality with the idea of natural law, arguing that &quot;special sins are against nature, as, for instance, those that run counter to the intercourse of male and female natural to animals, and so are peculiarly qualified as unnatural vices&quot;.

===New Guinea===
The Bedamini people of New Guinea believe that semen is the main source of masculinity and strength. In consequence, the sharing of semen between men, particularly when there is an age gap, is seen as promoting growth throughout nature, while excessive heterosexual activities are seen as leading to decay and death.

===Russia===
A survey run by the Levada Centre in Russia in July 2010 concluded that &quot;homophobia is widespread in Russian society&quot;. It draws this conclusion from the following findings. 74% of respondents believed that gays and lesbians are immoral or psychologically disturbed people. Only 15% responded that homosexuality is as legitimate as traditionally conceived sexual orientation. 39% consider that they should be compulsorily treated or alternatively isolated from society. 4% considered that it is necessary to liquidate people of a non-traditional sexual orientation.

On the other hand, many Russians (45%) were in favour of the equality of homosexuals with other citizens (41% against, 15% undecided). Most supported the introduction in Russia of laws forbidding discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and incitement of hatred for gays and lesbians (31% against, 28% undecided).

The Levada Centre reached the following conclusions on the distribution of these view in different groups of society. &quot;In Russian society, homophobia is most often encountered among men, older respondents (over 55), and people with an average level of education and low income... Women, young Russians (18–39), and well educated and comfortably off respondents showed more tolerance for people of a non-traditional sexual orientation, and more understanding of related issues. Respondents over 40, people of average or lower education or low incomes, and rural people—the sectors retaining the inertia of Soviet thinking—are more likely to believe that homosexuality is a disease requiring treatment, and that homosexuals must be isolated from society&quot;.

===Arab world===
Men who have sex with other men in Arab societies do not commonly refer to each other as homosexuals. Laurens Buijs, Gert Hekma, and Jan Willem Duyvendak, authors of the 2011 article &quot;&#x27;As long as they keep away from me&#x27;: The paradox of antigay violence in a gay-friendly country&quot;, said &quot;This might explain why they are more likely to condemn men who explicitly claim a homosexual identity. In the 2011 article they said that among men in Arab countries who do not identify as homosexual, anal sexual intercourse is &quot;often said to be common&quot; and that the men&#x27;s &quot;masculine gender role is not at stake as long as they take up the active role&quot;.

===Netherlands===
Laurens Buijs, Gert Hekma, and Jan Willem Duyvendak, authors of the 2011 article &quot;&#x27;As long as they keep away from me&#x27;: The paradox of antigay violence in a gay-friendly country&quot;, said that the Netherlands has a &quot;tolerant and gay-friendly image&quot;, and that Dutch people, according to cross-national survey research, exhibit more acceptance of homosexuality than &quot;most other European peoples&quot;. They also stated that Dutch people exhibit support for equal rights for and non-discrimination of homosexuals. They explained &quot;Amsterdam, in particular is often associated with gay emancipation, as it provided the setting for the world&#x27;s first legally recognized &#x27;gay marriage&#x27; in 2001, and hosts the famous gay parade with festively decorated boats floating through the city&#x27;s picturesque canals each year.&quot; According to the article, despite this reputation, the aspects of attempts of men to seduce other men, anal sex, behavior perceived as &quot;feminine&quot; from males, and public displays of affection among homosexuals are likely to trigger homophobia in the Netherlands.

They argued that &quot;antigay violence is a remarkably grave problem&quot; in that country. They explained that members of five ethnic groups, Dutch-Antilleans, Dutch-Greeks, Dutch-Moroccans, Dutch-Serbs, Dutch-Turks, &quot;are less accepting towards homosexuality, also when controlled for gender, age, level of education and religiosity&quot;. They also stated that the culture in the Armed Forces of the Netherlands &quot;is notoriously masculine and intolerant towards homosexuality&quot;. Until the year 2000, right wing politicians in the Netherlands generally opposed homosexuality, but as of 2011 show support of homosexuality and oppose anti-gay attitudes in immigrant groups, stating that the country has a &quot;Dutch tradition of tolerance&quot; for homosexuality.

===United States===
====McCarthy era====

In the 1950s in the United States, open homosexuality was taboo. Legislatures in every state had passed laws against homosexual behavior well before this, most notably anti-sodomy laws. Many politicians treated the homosexual as a symbol of antinationalism, construing masculinity as patriotism and marking the &quot;unmasculine&quot; homosexual as a threat to national security. This perceived connection between homosexuality and antinationalism was present in Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia as well, and appears in contemporary politics to this day.

Senator Joseph McCarthy used accusations of homosexuality as a smear tactic in his anti-Communist crusade, often combining the Second Red Scare with the Lavender Scare. On one occasion, he went so far as to announce to reporters, &quot;If you want to be against McCarthy, boys, you&#x27;ve got to be either a Communist or a cocksucker.&quot;

Senator Kenneth Wherry likewise attempted to invoke some connection between homosexuality and antinationalism as, for example, when he said in an interview with Max Lerner that &quot;You can&#x27;t hardly separate homosexuals from subversives.&quot; Later in that same interview he draws the line between patriotic Americans and gay men: &quot;But look Lerner, we&#x27;re both Americans, aren&#x27;t we? I say, let&#x27;s get these fellows [closeted gay men in government positions] out of the government.&quot;

There were other perceived connections between homosexuality and Communism. Wherry publicized fears that Joseph Stalin had obtained a list of closeted homosexuals in positions of power from Adolf Hitler, which he believed Stalin intended to use to blackmail these men into working against the U.S. for the Soviet regime. The 1950 Senate subcommittee &quot;Hoey Report&quot; &quot;Employment of Homosexuals and Other Sex Perverts in Government&quot; said that &quot;the pervert is easy prey to the blackmailer... It is an accepted fact among intelligence agencies that espionage organizations the world over consider sex perverts who are in possession of or have access to confidential material to be prime targets where pressure can be exerted.&quot; Along with that security-based concern, the report found homosexuals unsuitable for government employment because &quot;those who engage in overt acts of perversion lack the emotional stability of normal persons. In addition there is an abundance of evidence to sustain the conclusion that indulgence in acts of sex perversion weakens the moral fiber of an individual to a degree that he is not suitable for a position of responsibility.&quot; McCarthy and Roy Cohn used the secrets of closeted gay American politicians as tools for blackmail more often than did foreign powers.

====LGBT civil rights movement====

Beginning in the 20th century, LGBT rights movements have led to changes in social acceptance and in the media portrayal of same-gender relationships. The legalization of same-sex marriage, a major goal of gay rights supporters, was achieved across all fifty states during the period from 2004 to 2015. (See also LGBT rights organization.)

Attitudes toward homosexuality have changed in developed societies in the latter part of the 20th century, accompanied by a greater acceptance of gay people into both secular and religious institutions.

Some opponents of the movement say the term &quot;LGBT civil rights&quot; is a misnomer and an attempt to piggyback on the civil rights movement. Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson, for example, called the comparison of the civil rights movement to the &quot;gay rights movement&quot; a &quot;disgrace to a black American&quot;. He said that &quot;homosexuality is not a civil right. What we have is a bunch of radical homosexuals trying to attach their agenda to the struggles of the 1960s,&quot; while Jesse Jackson has said &quot;Gays were never called three-fifths human in the Constitution.&quot; Gene Rivers, a Boston minister, has accused gays of &quot;pimping&quot; the civil rights movement.

In contrast, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), a leading organization during the civil rights movement, has made clear their support for LGBT rights and equate it with other human rights and civil rights movements.

====Statistics====
73% of the general public in the United States in 2001 stated that they knew someone who is gay, lesbian, or bisexual. This is the result of a steady increase from 1983 when there were 24%, 43% in 1993, 55% in 1998, or 62% in 2000. The percentage of the general public who say there is more acceptance of LGB people in 2001 than before was 64%. Acceptance was measured on many different levels—87% of the general public would shop at a store owned by someone who is gay or lesbian but only 46% of the general public would attend a church or synagogue where a minister or rabbi is openly gay or lesbian. A 2011 survey by the Pew Research Center showed that 60% of U.S. adults think homosexuality should be accepted. Males and people over 65 years old are more likely to think it is wrong. Among people who do not know someone who is LGB, 61% think the behavior is wrong. Broken down by religion, 60% of evangelical Christians think that it is wrong, whereas 11% with no religious affiliation are against it. 57% of the general public think that gays and lesbians experience a lot of prejudice and discrimination, making it the group most believed to experience prejudice and discrimination. African Americans come in second at 42%.

In terms of support of public policies, according to the same 2001 study, 76% of the general public thought that there should be laws to protect gay and lesbian people from job discrimination, 74% from housing discrimination, 73% for inheritance rights, 70% support health and other employee benefits for domestic partners, 68% supported social security benefits, and 56% supported GL people openly serving in the military. 73% favored sexual orientation being included in the hate crimes statutes. 39% supported same-sex marriage, while 47% supported civil unions, and 46% supported adoption rights. A poll conducted in 2013 showed a record high of 58% of the American people supporting legal recognition for same-sex marriage.
A separate study shows that, in the United States, the younger generation is more supportive of gay rights than average, and that there is growing support for LBGT rights. In 2011, for the first time, a majority of Americans supported the legalization of same-sex marriage. In 2012, President Barack Obama voiced support for gay marriage, and in the November elections, three states voted to legalize gay marriage at the ballot box for the first time in history while an attempt to restrict same-sex marriage was rejected. In 2016, 55% of U.S. citizens supported same sex marriage and 37% opposed.

* Health Canada
* Patented Medicine Prices Review Board
* Public Health Agency of Canada

, the Health Portfolio consists of approximately 12,000 full-time equivalent employees and an annual budget of over $3.8 billion.

==History==

The first Department of Health in Canada was established in 1919, and unlike most other departments, had no designated minister. The president of the Privy Council was the first designated to manage the department, which was followed by the minister of immigration and colonization in 1921 under Arthur Meighen, then the minister of soldiers&#x27; civil re-establishment later that year under William Lyon Mackenzie King. The minister of soldiers&#x27; civil re-establishment managed the Department of Health through the next Meighen and King governments.

In 1928, the Department of Health and minister of soldiers&#x27; civil re-establishment were abolished and replaced with the Department and minister of pensions and national health. In 1944, the position was again split into two roles, with the war veteran portfolio going to the minister of veterans affairs, and the rest of the portfolio moving to the minister of national health and welfare.

The role of minister of national health and welfare was abolished in 1996, and replaced with the current minister of health. Jane Philpott was the first medical doctor to hold the post.

<doc id="372970" wikidata="Q1547789" url="?curid=372970" title="Word of Mouth (Jaco Pastorius album)">
<text>Word of Mouth is the second solo studio album by American bassist Jaco Pastorius, released in 1981, while he was still a member of the jazz fusion group Weather Report, and also the name of a big band that Pastorius assembled and with which he toured from 1981 to 1983.

== Critical reception ==
Reviewing the album in &quot;The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings&quot;, Cook and Morton favorably assessed the album, they wrote: &quot;A brilliant example of Jaco’s gift for sound (...) A lovely record, full of surprises&quot;, while in contrast Swenson saw the album as a troubled follow-up to the previous &quot;Jaco Pastorius&quot; album.

== Background ==

While his debut album showcased his eclectic and impressive skills on electric bass, &quot;Word of Mouth&quot; focused more on his ability to compose and arrange for a larger band. The album still shows off Pastorius&#x27;s skill, most notably in the solo opening to &quot;Chromatic Fantasy&quot; by J.S. Bach and the title track. &quot;Crisis&quot; also features a fast, bass pattern looping, which runs under the frantic soloing. Most of the rest of the album&#x27;s bass is subdued and blends into the band&#x27;s arrangement. The song &quot;John and Mary&quot; is dedicated to his children from his first marriage to Tracy; he had two other children, twin sons Julius and Felix with his second wife, Ingrid.

The band included Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Peter Erskine, Jack DeJohnette, Michael Brecker, Don Alias, and Toots Thielemans, who is featured on harmonica on many of the songs.

=== Crediting controversy ===

The first 50,000 copies of the album lacked credits for all participating musicians. As the result of a lawsuit against Warner Bros., CBS forbade the names of a few of the (less well-known) musicians to be mentioned on the sleeve. Pastorius defiantly replied that &quot;if they can&#x27;t be listed, then nobody will be listed&quot;. On later copies of the album, the names were listed.

== Track listing ==

All tracks written by Jaco Pastorius except where noted.

#&quot;Crisis&quot; – 5:17*
#&quot;Three Views of a Secret&quot; – 6:05
#&quot;Liberty City&quot; – 11:57
#&quot;Chromatic Fantasy&quot; (Johann Sebastian Bach) – 3:01
#&quot;Blackbird&quot; (Lennon–McCartney) – 2:48
#&quot;Word of Mouth&quot; – 3:53**
#&quot;John and Mary&quot; – 10:52

*For the original LP, Cassette and CD release, &quot;Crisis&quot; was 5:21. However, for reasons that are unclear, the current MP3 downloads cut the first three seconds of the improvisation. The 1981 Warner Brothers promo disc has the 5:17 listing for &quot;Crisis.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
**&quot;Word of Mouth&quot; is listed as being 4:21 in the liner notes, as it begins with the feedback at the end of &quot;Blackbird&quot; and ends with the whispering and giggling at the start of &quot;John and Mary&quot;.

<doc id="372972" wikidata="Q1088236" url="?curid=372972" title="Sodomy laws in the United States">
<text>The early United States inherited sodomy laws which constitutionally outlawed a variety of sexual acts deemed illegal, illicit, unlawful, unnatural or immoral from the colonial-era based laws of the United Kingdom in the 17th century. While these laws often targeted sexual acts between persons of the same sex, many sodomy-related statutes employed definitions broad enough to outlaw certain sexual acts between persons of different sexes, in some cases even including acts between married persons.

Through the mid to late 20th century, the gradual decriminalization of consensual sexual acts led to the elimination of anti-sodomy laws in most U.S. states. During this time, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of its sodomy laws in &quot;Bowers v. Hardwick&quot; in 1986. In 2003, the Supreme Court reversed that decision with &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;, which invalidated any state sodomy laws, some of which were still law in the following 14 states: Alabama, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Utah and Virginia.

==History==
=== Before &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; ===

During the colonial era of American history, the various European nations which established colonies in the Americas brought their pre-existing sodomy laws (which included capital punishment) with them. The establishment of the United States after their victory in the Revolutionary War did not bring about many changes in these laws. Beginning in the 19th century, the various state legislatures passed legislation which ended the status of capital punishment being used for those who were convicted under sodomy laws. South Carolina was the last state, in 1873, to repeal the death penalty for sodomy law violations. The number of times the death penalty was carried out under sodomy laws is unclear. Records show there were at least two executions, and a number of convictions with vague labels, such as &quot;crimes against nature&quot;.

According to one source, sodomy statutes in colonial America in the 17th century were largely unenforced as male-male eroticism did not threaten the social structure, challenge the gendered division of labor, or undermine the patriarchal ownership of wealth. There were gay men on General Washington&#x27;s staff and among the leaders of the new republic, even though in Virginia there was a maximum penalty of death for sodomy. In 1779, Thomas Jefferson tried to reduce Virginia&#x27;s maximum punishment for sodomy to castration, but it was rejected by the Virginia legislature.

Justice Anthony Kennedy authoring the majority opinion in &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; stated that American laws targeting same-sex couples did not develop until the last third of the 20th century and that early sodomy laws seemed not to be enforced for private consensual acts.

Prior to 1962, sodomy was a felony in every state punished by a lengthy term of imprisonment or hard labor. In that year, the Model Penal Code (MPC) — developed by the American Law Institute to promote uniformity among the states as they modernized their statutes — struck a compromise that removed consensual sodomy from its criminal code while making it a crime to solicit for sodomy. In 1962, Illinois adopted the recommendations of the Model Penal Code and thus became the first state to remove criminal penalties for consensual sodomy from its criminal code, almost a decade before any other state. Over the years, many of the states that did not repeal their sodomy laws had enacted legislation reducing the penalty.

At the time of the &quot;Lawrence&quot; decision in 2003, the penalty for violating a sodomy law varied widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction among those states retaining their sodomy laws. The harshest penalties were in Idaho, where a person convicted of sodomy could earn a life sentence. Michigan followed, with a maximum penalty of 15 years&#x27; imprisonment while repeat offenders got life. By 2002, 36 states had repealed their sodomy laws or their courts had overturned them. By the time of the 2003 Supreme Court decision, the laws in most states were no longer enforced or were enforced very selectively. The continued existence of these rarely enforced laws on the statute books, however, are often cited as justification for discrimination against gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals.

On June 26, 2003, the United States Supreme Court struck down in the &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; decision the following jurisdictions (14 US states, 1 US territory and the Uniform Code of Military Justice) that statutes criminalized consensual sodomy: Alabama, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri (rest of the state outside of the Missouri Court of Appeals, Western District), North Carolina, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Texas, United States Armed Forces, Utah and Virginia. On June 26, 2003, at the time of the &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; decision, the following jurisdictions (20 US states, 1 US territory and the Uniform Code of Military Justice) had statutes criminalizing consensual sodomy: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Texas, United States Armed Forces, Utah and Virginia.

====New York====
In 1950, New York enacted a new statute that divided the crime of sodomy into 3 degrees. First degree sodomy, with a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment, is defined as being done by force as in rape, or an act with an animal or a dead body. Second degree sodomy, with a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment, includes acts &quot;per os or per anum&quot; by a person over 21 years old with a person under 18 years old. Third degree sodomy, which is a misdemeanor with a maximum of 6 months in prison, is any act &quot;per os or per anum&quot; not amounting to first or second degree sodomy. With this new law, New York became the first state to reduce the crime of sodomy from a felony to a misdemeanor. A psychopathic offender law was included with this statute, but covered only sexual acts with minors or with the use of force or threats. In 1950, the Attorney General issued an opinion that the governing sodomy law covered both participants in an act of fellatio, the wording of the law being broader for oral sex than for anal. This opinion would be affirmed by a court interpretation more than a decade later.

In 1965, New York enacted a new statute repealing the crime of sodomy. Due to opposition to repealing the crime of sodomy, New York enacted a new statute at the same time that criminalized sodomy and reduced the maximum penalty from 6 months to 3 months, and excluded married couples. It created the category of sexual misconduct, defined as engaging in sexual intercourse with another person without such person&#x27;s consent and engaging in sexual conduct with an animal or a dead human body, which became a class A misdemeanor. Since the new statute repealing the crime of sodomy would only be effective on September 1, 1967, it never took effect.

====Idaho====
In the early 1970s, Idaho laws fluctuated on sexual crimes. On March 12, 1971, the Idaho House of Representatives voted was 55-5 in favor of House Bill 161, which enacted the entire Model Penal Code (MPC) in Idaho, which included repealing common-law crimes and the &quot;crime against nature&quot; law. The bill passed the Idaho Senate on March 25, 1971 and the vote was 34-1. It was signed on April 9, 1971 by Governor Cecil Andrus. It took effect on January 1, 1972. On January 25, 1972, the Idaho House voted was 44-28 in favor of House Bill 101, which repealed the provisions of House Bill 161, which had adopted the MPC. The bill passed the Idaho Senate on March 27, 1972 and the vote was 30-5. It was signed on March 27, 1972 by Governor Cecil Andrus. It took effect on April 1, 1972. On March 22, 1972, the Idaho House voted was 49-15 in favor of House Bill 59, which restored a criminal code framework after the repeal of House Bill 161, which included reinstating common-law crimes and reintroduced the felony &quot;crime against nature&quot; law, which included a minimum five-year penalty with no maximum limit. The bill passed the Idaho Senate on February 1, 1972 and the vote was 34-1. It was signed on February 18, 1972 by Governor Cecil Andrus. It took effect on April 1, 1972.

=== After &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; ===

In 2005, Puerto Rico repealed its sodomy law, and in 2006, Missouri repealed its law against &quot;homosexual conduct&quot;. In 2013, Montana removed &quot;sexual contact or sexual intercourse between two persons of the same sex&quot; from its definition of deviate sexual conduct, Virginia repealed its lewd and lascivious cohabitation statute, and sodomy was legalized in the US armed forces. In 2005, basing its decision on &quot;Lawrence&quot;, the Supreme Court of Virginia in &quot;Martin v. Ziherl&quot; invalidated § 18.2-344, the Virginia statute making fornication between unmarried persons a crime.

On January 31, 2013, the Senate of Virginia passed a bill repealing § 18.2-345, the lewd and lascivious cohabitation statute enacted in 1877. On February 20, 2013, the Virginia House of Delegates passed the bill by a vote of 62 to 25 votes. On March 20, 2013, Governor Bob McDonnell signed the repeal of the lewd and lascivious cohabitation statute from the Code of Virginia. On March 12, 2013, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit struck down § 18.2-361, the crimes against nature statute. On March 26, 2013, Attorney General of Virginia Ken Cuccinelli filed a petition to have the case reheard &quot;en banc&quot;, but the Court denied the request on April 10, 2013, with none of its 15 judges supporting the request. On June 25, Cuccinelli filed a petition for certiorari asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals decision, which was rejected on October 7.

On February 7, 2014, the Virginia Senate voted 40-0 in favor of revising the crimes against nature statute to remove the ban on same-sex sexual relationships. On March 6, 2014, the Virginia House of Delegates voted 100-0 in favor of the bill. On April 7, the Governor submitted a slightly different version of the bill. It was enacted by the legislature on April 23, 2014. The law took effect upon passage. On February 26, 2019, the Utah legislature voted to eliminate the crime of sodomy between consenting adults. Governor Gary Herbert signed the bill into law on March 26, 2019.

On May 23, 2019, the Alabama House of Representatives passed, with 101 voting yea and 3 absent, Alabama Senate Bill 320, repealing the ban on &quot;deviate sexual intercourse&quot;. On May 28, 2019, the Alabama State Senate passed Alabama Senate Bill 320, with 32 yea and 3 absent. The bill took effect on September 1, 2019. Alabama is the southernmost continental state to repeal their sodomy law as of 2023.

 While the original text of the bill intended to repeal both the state&#x27;s sodomy law and unnatural or perverted sexual practice law, amendments from the Maryland Senate urged to solely repeal the sodomy law. On March 31, 2023, the Maryland legislature voted to repeal the unnatural and perverted sexual practice law. The bill was sent to Governor Wes Moore for signature. As he did not veto the bill within 30 days of passage, Moore allowed for the bill to become law without his signature, and the repeal took effect on October 1, 2023.

In March 2022, Idaho repealed its sodomy law. The repeal was a result of a lawsuit brought on in September 2020 by a plaintiff known as John Doe. John Doe alleged his constitutional rights were violated when he was forced to register as a sex offender upon moving to Idaho due to a conviction for &quot;oral sex&quot; 2 decades prior. On May 17, 2023, the Minnesota legislature passed an Omnibus Judiciary and Public Safety Bill that included provisions repealing the state&#x27;s sodomy, adultery, fornication, and abortion laws. On May 19, Governor Tim Walz signed the bill into law. It took effect the following day.

As of January 2025, the following jurisdictions (12 U.S. states) had statutes criminalizing consensual sodomy: Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Texas. These statutes penalties are not enforceable due to the binding precedent of &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;, meaning consensual sodomy cannot be prosecuted.

==Sodomy laws by jurisdiction in the United States of America==

Below is a table of sodomy laws in the jurisdictions in United States of America and penalties as applicable to the binding precedent of &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;. The most recent jurisdiction to repeal its sodomy ban is Minnesota.

===Federal law===
Sodomy laws in the United States were largely a matter of state rather than federal jurisdiction, except for laws governing the District of Columbia and the U.S. Armed Forces.

===District of Columbia===
In 1801, the 6th United States Congress enacted the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801, a law that continued all criminal laws of Maryland and Virginia, with those of Maryland applying to the portion of the District ceded from Maryland and those of Virginia applying to the portion ceded from Virginia. As a result, in the Maryland-ceded portion, sodomy was punishable with up to seven years&#x27; imprisonment for free persons and with the death penalty for enslaved persons, whereas in the Virginia-ceded portion it was punishable between one and ten years&#x27; imprisonment for free persons and with the death penalty for enslaved persons. Maryland repealed the death penalty for slaves in 1809 and modified the penalty for all persons to match Virginia&#x27;s terms of imprisonment. In 1847, the Virginia-ceded portion was given back to Virginia, thus only the Maryland law had effect in the district. In 1871, Congress enacted the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1871, a law that reorganized the district government and granted it home rule. All existing laws were retained unless and until expressly altered by the new city council. Direct rule was reinstated in 1874. The criminal status of sodomy became ambiguous until 1901, when Congress passed legislation recognizing common law crimes, punishable with up to five years&#x27; imprisonment or a fine of $1,000.

In 1935, Congress made it a crime in the district to solicit a person &quot;for the purpose of prostitution, or any other immoral or lewd purpose&quot;. In 1948, Congress enacted the first law specific to sodomy in the district, which established a penalty of up to ten years in prison or a fine of up to $1,000, regardless of sexuality. Oral sex was included in the law&#x27;s application. Also included with this law was a psychopathic offender law and a law &quot;to provide for the treatment of sexual psychopaths&quot;. The metropolitan police department eventually had several officers whose sole job was to &quot;check on homosexuals&quot;. Multiple court cases dealt with the issue in the following years. Many of the published sodomy and solicitation cases during the 1950s and 1960s reveal clear entrapment policies by the local police, some of which were disallowed by reviewing courts. In 1972, settling the case of &quot;Schaefers et al. v. Wilson&quot;, the D.C. government announced its intention not to prosecute anyone for private, consensual adult sodomy, an action disputed by the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. The action came as part of a stipulation agreement in a court challenge to the sodomy law brought by four gay men.

In 1973, Congress again granted the district home rule through the District of Columbia Home Rule Act. It provided for a new city council that could pass its own laws. However laws regarding certain topics, such as changes to the criminal code, were restricted until 1977. All laws passed by the D.C. government are subject to a mandatory 30-day &quot;congressional review&quot; by Congress. If they are not blocked, then they become law. In 1981, the D.C. government enacted a law that repealed the sodomy law, as well as other consensual acts, and made the sexual assault laws gender neutral. However, the Congress overturned the new law. A successful legislative repeal of the law followed in 1993. This time, Congress did not interfere. In 1995, all references to sodomy were completely removed from the criminal code, and in 2004, the D.C. government repealed an outdated law against fornication.

===Military===
Although the U.S. military discharged soldiers for homosexual acts throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth century, U.S. military law did not expressly prohibit homosexuality or homosexual conduct until February 4, 1921.

On March 1, 1917, the Articles of War of 1916 were implemented. This included a revision of the Articles of War of 1806, the new regulations detail statutes governing U.S. military discipline and justice. Under the category Miscellaneous Crimes and Offences, Article 93 states that any person subject to military law who commits &quot;assault with intent to commit sodomy&quot; shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.

On June 4, 1920, Congress modified Article 93 of the Articles of War of 1916. It was changed to make the act of sodomy itself a crime, separate from the offense of assault with intent to commit sodomy. It went into effect on February 4, 1921.

On May 5, 1950, the Uniform Code of Military Justice was passed by Congress and was signed into law by President Harry S. Truman, and became effective on May 31, 1951. Article 125 forbids sodomy among all military personnel, defining it as &quot;any person subject to this chapter who engages in unnatural carnal copulation with another person of the same or opposite sex or with an animal is guilty of sodomy. Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the offence.&quot;

As for the U.S. Armed Forces, the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces has ruled that the &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; decision applies to Article 125, severely narrowing the previous ban on sodomy. In both &quot;United States v. Stirewalt&quot; and &quot;United States v. Marcum&quot;, the court ruled that the &quot;conduct [consensual sodomy] falls within the liberty interest identified by the Supreme Court,&quot; but went on to say that despite the application of &quot;Lawrence&quot; to the military, Article 125 can still be upheld in cases where there are &quot;factors unique to the military environment&quot; that would place the conduct &quot;outside any protected liberty interest recognized in &quot;Lawrence&quot;.&quot; Examples of such factors include rape, fraternization, public sexual behavior, or any other factors that would adversely affect good order and discipline. Convictions for consensual sodomy have been overturned in military courts under &quot;Lawrence&quot; in both &quot;United States v. Meno&quot; and &quot;United States v. Bullock&quot;.

====Repeal====

On December 26, 2013, President Barack Obama signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, which repealed the Article 125 ban on consensual sodomy.

<text>Malabar Hill is amongst the most affluent residential areas in Mumbai. It is home to several business tycoons and film personalities. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, had built and lived in a bungalow, called South Court, in Malabar Hill. 

Prominent landmarks include the South Court mansion of the Jinnah family, the Chief Minister of Maharashtra&#x27;s Varsha Bungalow, Government Guest House Sahyadri, official residences of VVIP state officials and additionally the Hanging Gardens, Jain Temple and Banganga Tank. Other notable residents include Radhakishan Damani and Syedna Mufaddal Saifuddin.

==History==

Malabar Hill is the location of the Walkeshwar Temple, founded by the Silhara kings. The original temple was destroyed by the Portuguese, but rebuilt again in 1715 by Rama Kamath, and by 1860, 10 to 20 other temples were built in the region.

Mountstuart Elphinstone built the first bungalow in Malabar Hill while he was Governor of Bombay, between 1819 and 1827. Following his example, the place soon became an affluent locality, as it remains today.

==Overview==

Raj Bhavan, the official residence of the governor of Maharashtra, &#x27;Varsha&#x27;, which is the official residence of the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, &#x27;Glenogle&#x27; the official residence of the General Manager of Central Railway (erstwhile Great Indian Peninsula Railway) are located here.

An unhindered view of Back Bay, with the Girgaon Chowpatty beach in the foreground, and the Nariman Point skyline in the background is one of the reasons for the high real estate prices. In January 2012, Maheshwari House was (partly) sold to industrialist Sajjan Jindal of Jindal Steel for 400 crores. The most expensive private residence lies just outside Malabar Hill on Altamount Road off Pedder Road, namely Antilia, the 27-storey, billion-dollar tower in Mumbai, owned by India&#x27;s second richest and the world&#x27;s tenth-richest person Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries.

Buses only started serving this area during World War II.

South Court (informally known as the &#x27;Jinnah House&#x27;), the former residence of Mohammad Ali Jinnah, founder of Pakistan is also present here, but is closed to public due to property disputes.

Unique among wealthy areas in Mumbai, it has long welcomed residents of Muslim heritage. More than 250 locals from the politically influential and economically affluent Dawoodi Bohra community live in the palatial Saifee Mahal complex near the top of the hill contributing to the ethnic milieu and cultural vibrancy of the area.

Also of note in the Malabar Hill district, there is a cremation ground that sits near the sea which is home to the samadhi shrines of several famous Indian saints. Notably among them is the samadhi shrine of the guru of Shri Nisargadatta Maharaj, who was Shri Siddharameshwar Maharaj, as well as the samadhi shrine of his devoted disciple Shri Ranjit Maharaj. 

Notable people born in Malabar Hill include singer-songwriter Jaimin Rajani and Douglas Jardine, the English cricketer who captained England during the Bodyline tour of Australia in 1932-33.

<doc id="372981" wikidata="Q199910" url="?curid=372981" title="Magdalena Department">
<text>Magdalena () is a department of Colombia with more than 1.3 million people, located to the north of the country by the Caribbean Sea. The capital of the Magdalena Department is Santa Marta and was named after the Magdalena River. It inherited the name of one of the original nine states of the United States of Colombia that its current territory integrated.

==Geography==


===Location===

The Department of Magdalena is located on the North Coast of the Colombian Caribbean Region.

On the north it borders the Caribbean Sea.
On the northeast it borders the La Guajira Department, being divided by the Palomino River.
On the east it borders with the Cesar Department, which is in part divided by the Guaraní River.

On the west, it is divided by the Magdalena River, and it borders the departments of Atlantico in the Northwest, and Bolívar in the West and Southwest.

===Hydrology===

====Basins====
The territory of the Department of Magdalena is formed by four drainage basins which are very different in composition and importance.

;Sierra Nevada&#x27;s Northern Slope

The drainage basin of the Sierra Nevada&#x27;s western slope is located in the northern part of the department. The Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta creates different rivers that run mainly through the municipality of Santa Marta, and that finally end up draining into the Caribbean Sea.

The rivers that form part of this basin are:
* Palomino River
* Don Diego River 2
* Buritaca River
* Guachaca River
* Mendiguaca River
* Piedras River
* Manzanares River
* Gaira River

;Sierra Nevada’s Southwestern Slope

This basin gathers its waters from the rivers coming from the southern and western slopes of the Sierra Nevada. The basin irrigates great extensions of the municipalities of Ciénaga, Zona Bananera, Fundación, Aracataca, and El Retén, which are the heart of the agricultural and livestock economy of the department.
The rivers that form part of this basin are:
* Frío River
* Sevilla River
* Tucurinca River
* Aracataca River
* Fundación River
* Rosa Creek

It also consists of a small number of arroyos that only flow during the rainy seasons.

This basin also encompasses the Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta, the largest marsh in the north of the country, which is formed by 16 smaller marshes that are connected by means of arms within the march. The balance of the march is a delicate one that depends on the fresh waters coming from the Sierra Nevada, and the periodical flooding of the Magdalena River, and the salt water coming from the mouth of the March to the sea, that is carried by the current and winds into the marshland.

;Magdalena Basin

The Magdalena River Basin is the largest drainage basin in the department, it is formed by the Magdalena River and its tributaries that feed on to the river and the Marsh.

The Mompóx Depression is found within this basin, this depression runs from the Zapatosa Marsh to the delta of the Magdalena River. This depression collects the most water in the department as its where the Cauca River, Cesar River, and the San Jorge River drain its waters. The Magdalena River is by far the most affluent river of these, and during the rainy season when it overflows, it causes the other rivers to flow backwards, not before overflowing the marshes and sometimes flooding some valleys.

;Ariguaní Basin

The Ariguaní River drains into the Magdalena River through the Zapatosa Marsh and washes over the central valleys of the departments of Magdalena and Cesar that are the principal areas of agriculture and animal husbandry in the Caribbean Region.

;Marshes

The department of Magdalena is characterized by its many marshes and extensive marshland valleys. The whole western side of the department its dotted with marshes and lakes due to the Magdalena River that borders the department on this side. Most of this marshes are located in the northwestern side. The permanent marshes are, Chilloa, La Rinconada, Tesca, Pijiño, Juan Criollo, Jaraba, Playa Afuera, Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta, and Zapatosa.

The Ciénaga Grande de Santa Marta, is the biggest and by far the most important marsh in the department of Magdalena and one of the most important marshes in the country. It is located in the northwest of the department and is separated from the sea by a very thin margin of land, only a few meters away. It has an extension of , of which are just water mirrors with a depth of 2 to 6 meters.

The Zapatosa Marsh, located in the municipality of El Plato in the southernmost part of the department, it is shared with the Cesar Department, who controls most of its waters. It has an extension of and at its deepest it reaches about . In it many rivers of different importance merge. The Zapatosa Marsh drains into the Magdalena River by an arm of about of length.

===Climate===
The Department of Magdalena, because of its terrain, and proximity to the sea has an unstable weather. Its Climate is mainly dictated by its global positioning, and because the department of Magdalena is located on the Intertropical Convergence Zone it possess an inter-tropical climate. Temperature in the department is affected by ocean currents, precipitation and atmospheric pressure, it mainly has a hot temperatures with high humidity, but temperatures vary as altitude raises.

The altitude of the department goes from 0m to 5,775m above sea levels, the drastic changes of altitude divide the territory into what is called thermal floors. There are no solid or determined divides between these floors as local factors can affect the temperature. The first 200m of altitude are considered the warm lands, they occupy a great extension of the departmental territory, the average temperature is of 30 °C. The main urban centers are located in the warm lands, including all of the downtown urban area of Santa Marta. The altitude increase because of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, an isolated mountain, the highest at sea level, and temperatures raise as it goes up.

===Winds===
The presence of the Sierra Nevada in this area of the country has consequences in the climate of the department, the SNSM stands windward blocking the path of the Trade winds that blow from the North and Northeast creating a greater cloud accumulation and precipitation. The winds that crash into the mountain ascend in an Orographic lift, this cooler air cannot hold the moisture as well as warm air and this effectively raises the relative humidity, creating clouds and frequently precipitation. The clouds that manage to pass over the mountain, move hastily downwards creating foehn winds that raise the temperature of the area west of the Sierra, which include the Santa Marta, and Ciénaga.

In the coastal area, droughts are cause by the diversion of the cold and warm katabatic winds coming down the Sierra, however the sea breezes help to cool down temperatures a bit, but by because of their direction, they end up extending the drought effects farther inland.

===Rainfall===

The department of Magdalena due to its location in the Intertropical Convergence Zone has only two seasons. The Rainy season takes place between April and November, with a period of less intensity between June and August. The dry season takes place during December and March.

The Mompox Depression presents its own climatic conditions due to its many permanent bodies of water, like the different ciénagas or mashes, and rivers and lakes. This wet habitat, permanently exposed to solar radiation, makes for a very humid environment, with an average annual rainfall of between 1,500 and 2,000mm, these rains are Convection rains as they are created by evaporation of its waters by high temperatures, this is typical precipitation around the equatorial belt.

Due to its complicated geography, the precipitation in the department ranges from 250mm in the driest areas, to 4,000mm in the cold floors of the Sierra Nevada.

===Environment===

The territory of Magdalena has an area of approximately 23,188 km², small compared to other regions, but in its territory various types of different ecoregions are found. From the beaches and sea landscape in the North, the snow-covered peaks in the Sierra, the swampy marshes in the west, the cloud forests, to the grasslands inland, the urban districts, the farmlands, the dry desert like, the deep rain forest, the rocky rivers to many other small ecosystems. These ecosystem support different fauna and flora and house many delicate species.

====Ecoregions====

According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, in the Magdalena Department 8 different distinct ecoregions are found in its territory.

==Politics==

===Administrative divisions===

The Department of Magdalena is subdivided into 30 municipalities and one district. The municipalities are governed by a democratically elected municipal mayor and a municipal council. The Touristic, Cultural and Historic District of Santa Marta is administered by the Municipality of Santa Marta and has special distinction within the country.

<text>The Chinese people, or simply Chinese, are people or ethnic groups identified with China, usually through ethnicity, nationality, citizenship, or other affiliation.

Chinese people are known as Zhongguoren () or as Huaren () by speakers of standard Chinese, including those living in Greater China as well as overseas Chinese. Although both terms both refer to Chinese people, their usage depends on the person and context. The former term is commonly (but not exclusively) used to refer to the citizens of the People&#x27;s Republic of China—especially mainland China. The term Huaren is used to refer to ethnic Chinese, and is more often used for those who reside overseas or are non-citizens of China. 

The Han Chinese are the largest ethnic group in China, comprising approximately 92% of its Mainland population. They comprise approximately 95% of the population of Taiwan, 92% in Hong Kong, and 89% in Macau. They are also the world&#x27;s largest ethnic group, comprising approximately 18% of the global human population.

Outside China, the terms &quot;Han Chinese&quot; and &quot;Chinese&quot; are often wrongly conflated since those identifying or registered as Han Chinese are the dominant ethnic group in China. There are 55 officially-recognized ethnic minorities in China who are also Chinese by nationality.

People from Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), may also be referred to as &quot;Chinese&quot; in various contexts, though they are usually referred to as &quot;Taiwanese&quot;. The territory of Taiwan is disputed and the ROC has limited recognition of its sovereignty.

The term &quot;Overseas Chinese&quot; is used to refer to people of Chinese origin living overseas as well as Chinese citizens residing outside China, but more commonly the former.

==Ethnic groups in China and associated territories==
A number of ethnic groups as well as other racial minorities of China are referred to as Chinese people.

=== Ethnic groups in China ===

Han Chinese people, the largest ethnic group in China, are often wrongly referred to as &quot;Chinese&quot; or &quot;ethnic Chinese&quot; in English. The Han Chinese also form a majority or notable minority in other countries, and they comprise approximately 18% of the global human population.

Other ethnic groups in China include the Zhuang, Hui, Manchus, Uyghurs, and Miao, who make up the five largest ethnic minorities in mainland China, with populations of approximately 10 million or more. In addition, the Yi, Tujia, Tibetans and Mongols each have populations between five and ten million.

China, officially the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), recognizes 56 native Chinese ethnic groups. There are also several unrecognized ethnic groups in China.

==== Ethnic groups in dynastic China ====
The term &quot;Chinese people&quot; ( ; Manchu: &quot;Dulimbai gurun i niyalma&quot;) was used by the Qing government to refer to all traditionally native subjects of the empire, including Han, Manchu, and Mongols.

==== Zhonghua minzu (the &quot;Chinese nation&quot;) ====
&quot;Zhonghua minzu&quot; (), the &quot;Chinese nation&quot;, is a supra-ethnic concept which includes all 56 ethnic groups living in China that are officially recognized by the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It includes established ethnic groups who have lived within the borders of premodern China. The term &quot;zhonghua minzu&quot; was used during the Republic of China from 1911 to 1949 to refer to five primary ethnic groups in China. The term &quot;zhongguo renmin&quot; (), &quot;Chinese people&quot;, was the government&#x27;s preferred term during the early communist era; &quot;zhonghua minzu&quot; is more common in recent decades.

=== Ethnic groups in Taiwan ===
Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), recognizes 17 native Taiwanese ethnic groups as well as numerous other &quot;New Immigrant&quot; ethnic groups (mostly originating from mainland China and Southeast Asia). Of the 17 native Taiwanese ethnic groups, 16 are considered to be indigenous (Taiwanese indigenous peoples), whereas one is considered to be non-native (Han Taiwanese). There are also several unrecognized indigenous ethnic groups in Taiwan.

The Han Taiwanese, who are Han Chinese people living in Taiwan, are usually categorized by the Taiwanese government into three main ethnic groups; the Taiwanese Hoklos, Taiwanese Hakkas, and &quot;waishengren&quot; (i.e. &quot;Mainland Chinese people in Taiwan&quot;). The Kinmenese and Matsunese peoples are two other significant Han Taiwanese ethnic groups.

The Taiwanese Hoklos and Hakkas are both considered to be &quot;native&quot; populations of Taiwan since they first began migrating to Taiwan in significant numbers from Fujian and Guangdong over 400 years ago (they first began migrating to Taiwan in minor numbers several centuries earlier). They are often collectively referred to in Taiwanese Mandarin as &quot;Benshengren&quot; (meaning &quot;people from this province&quot;). Those self-identifying as Hoklo culturally comprise approximately 70% of Taiwan&#x27;s total population and the Hakkas comprise approximately 14% of Taiwan&#x27;s total population.

Meanwhile, the so-called Mainlanders (Taiwanese) are mostly descended from people who migrated from mainland China to Taiwan during the 1940s and 1950s. They are often referred to in Taiwanese Mandarin as &quot;Waishengren&quot; (meaning &quot;people from outside of this province&quot;). The Mainlanders (Taiwanese) comprise approximately 14% of Taiwan&#x27;s total population.

Collectively, the various Taiwanese indigenous peoples comprise approximately 2% of Taiwan&#x27;s total population. The various Taiwanese indigenous peoples are believed to have been living in Taiwan for up to 6000 years prior to the colonization of Taiwan by China which began during the 17th century (CE).

==== Recognition by the Chinese government ====
The Han Taiwanese, Native Taiwanese (Benshengren), Hoklo Taiwanese, Hakka Taiwanese, Mainlander Taiwanese (Waishengren), Kinmenese, and Matsunese ethnic groups (all subtypes or branches of the Han Chinese ethnic group) are all unrecognized by the Chinese government. Furthermore, the sixteen Taiwanese indigenous peoples that are officially recognized by the Taiwanese government are also all unrecognized by the Chinese government. The Chinese government also doesn&#x27;t recognize the ethnic designation &quot;New Immigrant&quot;.

The Chinese government instead has its own ethnic designations for Taiwanese people. Han Taiwanese people are considered to be Han Chinese people (no distinction is made), whereas the various recognized and unrecognized (by Taiwan) Taiwanese indigenous peoples are collectively recognized (by China) to be &quot;Gaoshanren&quot; (i.e. &quot;High Mountain People&quot;). The Gaoshanren are one of the 56 officially-recognized ethnic groups of China.

== Nationality, citizenship and residence ==

The Nationality law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China regulates nationality within the PRC. A person obtains nationality either by birth when at least one parent is of Chinese nationality or by naturalization. All people holding nationality of the People&#x27;s Republic of China are citizens of the Republic. The Resident Identity Card is the official form of identification for residents of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Within the People&#x27;s Republic of China, a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport or Macao Special Administrative Region passport may be issued to permanent residents of Hong Kong or Macao, respectively.

The Nationality law of the Republic of China regulates nationality within the Republic of China (Taiwan). A person obtains nationality either by birth or by naturalization. A person with at least one parent who is a national of the Republic of China, or born in the ROC to stateless parents qualifies for nationality by birth.

The National Identification Card is an identity document issued to people who have household registration in Taiwan. The Resident Certificate is an identification card issued to residents of the Republic of China who do not hold a National Identification Card.

The relationship between ROC nationality and PRC nationality is disputed.

== Overseas Chinese ==


Overseas Chinese refers to people of Chinese ethnicity or national heritage who live outside the People&#x27;s Republic of China or Taiwan as the result of the continuing diaspora. People with one or more Chinese ancestors may consider themselves overseas Chinese. Such people vary widely in terms of cultural assimilation. In some areas throughout the world ethnic enclaves known as Chinatowns are home to populations of overseas Chinese.

In Southeast Asia, people of Chinese descent call themselves () instead of ( ) which commonly refers to the citizens of the People&#x27;s Republic of China or the Republic of China. This is especially so in the Chinese communities of Southeast Asia. The term &quot;Zhongguoren&quot; has a more political or ideological aspect in its use; while many in China may use &quot;Zhongguoren&quot; to mean the Chinese ethnicity, some in Taiwan would refuse to be called &quot;Zhongguoren&quot;.

<text>A soliloquy (, from Latin &quot;solo&quot; &quot;to oneself&quot; + &quot;loquor&quot; &quot;I talk&quot;, plural soliloquies) is a monologue addressed to oneself, thoughts spoken out loud without addressing another person. 

Soliloquies are used as a device in drama. In a soliloquy, a character typically is alone on a stage and makes their thoughts, feelings, and intentions known to the audience, addressing it directly or take it into their confidence, wholly or in part. English Renaissance drama used soliloquies to great effect, such as in the soliloquy &quot;To be, or not to be&quot;, the centerpiece of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

<text>Tamil literature includes a collection of literary works that have come from a tradition spanning more than two thousand years. The oldest extant works show signs of maturity indicating an even longer period of evolution. Contributors to the Tamil literature are mainly from Tamil people from south India, including the land now comprising Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Eelam Tamils from Sri Lanka, as well as the Tamil diaspora.

The history of Tamil literature follows the history of Tamil Nadu, closely following the social, economical, political and cultural trends of various periods. The early Sangam literature, dated before 300 BCE, contain anthologies of various poets dealing with many aspects of life, including love, war, social values and religion. This was followed by the early epics and moral literature, authored by Vaishnavite, Shaivite, Ājīvika, Jain and Buddhist authors and poets lasting up to the 5th century CE. From the 6th to 12th century CE, the Tamil devotional poems written by Alvars (sages of Vaishnavism) and Nayanmars (sages of Shaivism) and, heralded the great Bhakti movement which later engulfed the entire Indian subcontinent. During the medieval era some of the grandest of Tamil literary classics like Kambaramayanam and Periya Puranam were authored and many poets were patronized by the imperial Chola and Pandya empires. The later medieval period saw many assorted minor literary works and also contributions by a few Muslim and European authors.

A revival of Tamil literature took place from the late 19th century when works of religious and philosophical nature were written in a style that made it easier for the common people to enjoy. The modern Tamil literary movement started with Subramania Bharathi, the multifaceted Indian nationalist poet and author, and was quickly followed up by many who began to utilize the power of literature in influencing the masses. With growth of literacy, Tamil prose began to blossom and mature. Short stories and novels began to appear. Modern Tamil literary criticism also evolved. The popularity of Tamil cinema has also interacted with Tamil literature in some mutually enriching ways.
== Sangam age ==
Sangam literature comprises some of the oldest extant Tamil literature, and deals with love, traditions, war, governance, trade and bereavement. Unfortunately much of the Tamil literature belonging to the Sangam period has been lost. The literature currently available from this period is perhaps just a fraction of the wealth of material produced during this golden age of Tamil civilization. The available literature from this period has been broadly divided in antiquity into three categories based roughly on chronology. These are: the Eighteen Greater Text Series (&quot;Pathinenmaelkanakku&quot;) comprising the Eight Anthologies (&quot;Ettuthokai&quot;) and the Ten Idylls (&quot;Pattupattu&quot;), the Five Great Epics and the Five Minor Epics. &quot;Tolkaappiyam&quot;, a commentary on grammar, phonetics, rhetoric and poetics is dated from this period.


Tamil legends hold that these were composed in three successive poetic assemblies (&quot;Sangam&quot;) that were held in ancient times on a now vanished continent far to the south of India. A significant amount of literature could have preceded &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; as grammar books are usually written after the existence of literature over long periods. Tamil tradition holds the earliest &quot;Sangam&quot; poetry to be over twelve millennia old. Modern linguistic scholarship places the poems between the 3rd century BCE and the 2nd century CE.

The Sangam age is considered by the Tamil people as the golden era of the Tamil language. This was the period when the Tamil country was ruled by the three &#x27;crowned kings&#x27; the Cheras, Pandyas, and the Cholas. The land was at peace with no major external threats. Ashoka&#x27;s conquests had no impact on the Tamil land and the people were able to indulge in literary pursuits. The poets had a much more casual relationship with their rulers than can be imagined in later times. They could chide them when they are perceived to wander from the straight and narrow. The greatness of the Sangam age poetry may be ascribed not so much to its antiquity, but due to the fact that their ancestors were indulging in literary pursuits and logical classification of the habitats and society in a systematic manner with little to draw from precedents domestically or elsewhere. The fact that these classifications were documented at a very early date in the grammatical treatise &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot;, demonstrates the organized manner in which the Tamil language has evolved. &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; is not merely a textbook on Tamil grammar giving the inflection and syntax of words and sentences but also includes classification of habitats, animals, plants and human beings. The discussion on human emotions and interactions is particularly significant. Tolkappiyam is divided into three chapters: orthography, etymology and subject matter (&quot;Porul&quot;). While the first two chapters of Tolkappiyam help codify the language, the last part, &quot;Porul&quot; refers to the people and their behavior. The grammar helps to convey the literary message on human behavior and conduct, and uniquely merges the language with its people.

The literature was classified into the broad categories of &#x27;subjective&#x27; (&quot;akam&quot;) and &#x27;objective&#x27; (&quot;puram&quot;) topics to enable the poetic minds to discuss any topic under the sun, from grammar to love, within the framework of well prescribed, socially accepted conventions. 

Recognizing that human activities cannot take place in vacuum and are constantly influenced by environmental factors, human experiences, in general, and subjective topics in particular, are assigned to specific habitats. Accordingly, land was classified into five genres (&quot;thinai&quot;): &quot;mullai&quot; (forests), &quot;kurinji&quot; (mountainous regions), &quot;marutham&quot; (agricultural lands), &quot;neithal&quot; (seashore), &quot;paalai&quot; (wasteland). The images associated with these landscapes – birds, beasts, flowers, gods, music, people, weather, seasons – were used to subtly convey a mood, associated with an aspect of life. &quot;Kuruntokai&quot;, a collection of poems belonging to the &quot;Ettuthokai&quot; anthology demonstrates an early treatment of the Sangam landscape. Such treatments are found to be much refined in the later works of &quot;Akananuru&quot; and &quot;Paripaatal&quot;. &quot;Paripaatal&quot; takes its name from the musical &quot;Paripaatal meter&quot; utilised in these poems. This is the first instance of a work set to music. &quot;Akaval&quot; and &quot;kalippa&quot; were the other popular meters used by poets during the Sangam age.

===Religion in the Sangam age===
Religion in the Sangam age was an important reason for the increase in Tamil literature. Ancient Tamils primarily followed the Vaishnavism tradition (which considered Vishnu as the supreme deity) and Kaumaram (who worshiped Murugan as the supreme god). According to Kamil Zvelebil, Vishnu was considered ageless (the god who stays forever) and was regarded as the supreme god of Tamils, whereas Skanda was considered to be young and was regarded as a personal god of Tamils.

Mayon is indicated to be the deity associated with the &quot;mullai tiṇai&quot; (pastoral landscape) in the &quot;Tolkāppiyam&quot;. Tolkappiyar mentions Mayon first when he made reference to deities in the different land divisions. The &quot;Paripādal&quot; (, meaning &quot;the paripadal-metre anthology&quot;) is a classical Tamil poetic work and traditionally the fifth of the Eight Anthologies (&quot;Ettuthokai&quot;) in the Sangam literature. According to Tolkāppiyam, &quot;Paripadal&quot; is a kind of verse dealing only with love (&quot;akapporul&quot;) and does not fall under the general classification of verses. Sangam literature (200 BCE to 500 CE) mentions Mayon or the &quot;dark one&quot;, as the supreme deity who creates, sustains, and destroys the universe and was worshipped in the Plains and mountains of Tamilakam.The earliest verses of &quot;Paripadal&quot; describe the glory of Perumal in the most poetic of terms. Many poems of the &quot;Paripadal&quot; consider Perumal as the supreme god of Tamils. He is regarded to be the only deity who enjoyed the status of &quot;Paramporul&quot; (achieving oneness with Paramatma) during the Sangam age. He is also known as Māyavan, Māmiyon, Netiyōn, and Māl in Sangam literature and considered as the most mentioned god in the Sangam literature.

&quot;Cēyōṉ&quot; &quot;the red one&quot;, who is identified with Murugan, whose name is literally &quot;Murukaṉ&quot; (&quot;the youth&quot;) in the &quot;Tolkāppiyam&quot;; extant works of Sangam literature, dated between the third century BCE and the fifth century CE, glorified Murugan, &quot;the red god seated on the blue peacock, who is ever young and resplendent&quot;, as &quot;the favoured god of the Tamils&quot;. There are no mentions of Shiva in Tolkappiyam. Shiva and Brahma are said to be forms of Maha Vishnu and considers Vishnu as the supreme god in Paripāṭal.

There are two poems depicted as example of Bhakti in ancient Tamil Nadu, one in the praise of Maha Vishnu and other of Murugan. 

To Tirumal (Maha Vishnu):

To Seyyon (Skandha):
The other gods also referred to in the &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; are &quot;Vēntaṉ&quot; &quot;the sovereign&quot; (identified with Indra) and &quot;Korravai&quot; &quot;the victorious&quot; (identified with Durga) and &quot;Varunan&quot; &quot;the sea god&quot;.

== Post-Sangam period ==
=== Didactic age ===
The three centuries after the Sangam age marks the didactic age. The invaders replaced number of words and concepts relating to ethics, philosophy and religion of Tamil. Around 300 CE, the Tamil land was under the influence of a group of people known as the Kalabhras. Although the religious identification of the Kalabhras is unknown, they were patrons of Buddhism, Jainism, and Ājīvika. Possibly as a result, a number of Buddhist authors flourished during this period. Jainism and Buddhism saw rapid growth. These authors, perhaps reflecting the austere nature of their faiths, created works mainly on morality and ethics. A number of Jain and Buddhist poets contributed to the creation of these didactic works as well as grammar and lexicography. The collection the Eighteen Lesser Text series (&quot;Pathinenkilkanakku&quot;) was of this period.

The best known of these works on ethics is the &quot;Tirukkural&quot; by Thiruvalluvar. The book is a comprehensive manual of ethics, polity and love, containing 1,330 distichs or &quot;kural&quot; divided into chapters of ten distichs each: the first thirty-eight on ethics, the next seventy on polity and the remainder on love.

Other famous works of this period are &quot;Kaḷavaḻi Nāṟpatu&quot;, &quot;Nalatiyar&quot;, &quot;Inna Narpathu&quot; and &quot;Iniyavai Narpathu&quot;. The Jain texts &quot;Nalatiyar&quot; and &quot;Pazhamozhi Nanuru&quot; each consist of four hundred poems, each of which cites a proverb and then illustrates it with a story.

=== Devotional period ===

The fall of the Kalabhras around 500 CE saw a reaction from the thus suppressed Hindus. The Kalabhras were replaced by the Pandyas in the south and by the Pallavas in the north. Even with the exit of the Kalabhras, the Jain and Buddhist influence still remained in Tamil Nadu. The early Pandya and the Pallava kings were followers of these faiths. The Hindu reaction to this apparent decline of their religion was growing and reached its peak during the later part of the 7th century. There was a widespread Hindu revival during which a huge body of Vaishnava and Saiva literature was created . Many Vaishnava Alvars provided a great stimulus to the growth of popular devotional literature . Vaishnava Alvars were producing devotional hymns and their songs were collected later into the Four Thousand Sacred Hymns (&quot;Naalayira Divyap Prabhandham&quot;) by &quot;Nathamunigal&quot; . It is considered as the Tamil Vedam equal to the Sanskrit vedas . The three earliest Alvars were Poigai Alvar, Bhoothath Alvar and Pey Alvar . Each of these wrote one hundred &quot;Venpas&quot; on the glory of Maha Vishnu in Tirukoilur . Tirumalisai Alwar who was a contemporary of the Pallava Mahendravarman I wrote such works as &quot;Naanmugantiruvadiandadi&quot;. Tirumangai Alvar who lived in the 8th century CE was a more prolific writer and his works constitute about a third of the Diyaprabhandam. Periyalvar and his adopted daughter Andal contributed nearly 650 hymns to the Vaishnava canon. Andal symbolised purity and love for the God and wrote her hymns addressing Vishnu as a lover. The hymn of Andal which starts with &quot;Vaaranam Aayiram&quot; (One Thousand Elephants) tells of her dream wedding to Vishnu and is sung even today at Tamil Vaishnava weddings. Nammalvar, who lived in the 9th century, wrote &quot;Tiruvaimoli&quot;. It comprises 1,101 stanzas and is held in great esteem for its elucidation of the Upanishads. This corpus was collected by Nathamuni, around 950 CE and formed the classical and vernacular basis for Sri Vaishnavism. These hymns &quot;Naalayira Divya Prabhandham&quot; is respected at par with Vedas by Sri Vaishnavites in sanctity and holiness and hence referred to as &quot;Dravida Vedam&quot; or &quot;Tamil Vedam&quot;.

Along with the Vaishnava Alvars, Many Saiva Nayanmars were also producing devotional hymns and their songs were collected later into Periya Puranam . Karaikal Ammaiyar who lived in the 6th century CE was the earliest of these Nayanmars. The celebrated Saiva hymnists Sundaramoorthy, Thirugnana Sambanthar and Thirunavukkarasar (also known as Appar) were of this period. Of Appar&#x27;s verses 3066 have survived. Sambandar sang 4,169 verses. Together these form the first six books of the Saiva canon, collected by Nambi Andar Nambi in the 10th century. Sundarar wrote Tiruttondartokai which gives the list of sixty-two Nayanmars. This was later elaborated by Sekkilar in his Periyapuranam (4,272 verses) . Manikkavasagar, who lived around the 8th century CE was a minister in the Pandya court. His Tiruvasakam consisting of over 600 verses is noted for its passionate devotion. These Saivite hymns collectively called Thirumurai.

=== Narrative epics ===
&quot;Cilappatikaram&quot; is one of the outstanding works of general literature of this period. The authorship and exact date of the classic &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot; are not definitely known. Ilango Adigal, who is credited with this work was reputed to be the brother of the Sangam age Chera king Senguttuvan. However there is no surviving information of such a brother in the numerous poems sung about the Chera king. The &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot; is unique in its vivid portrayal of the ancient Tamil land. This is unknown in other works of this period. &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot; and its companion epic &quot;Manimekalai&quot; are Jain and Buddhist philosophy. &quot;Manimekalai&quot; was written by Sattanar who was a contemporary of Ilango Adigal. Manimekalai contains a long exposition of fallacies of logic. Kongu Velir, a Jain author wrote &quot;Perunkathai&quot;. &quot;Valayapathi&quot; and &quot;Kundalakesi&quot; are the names of two other narrative poems of this period written by a Jain and a Buddhist author respectively. These works have been lost and only a few poems of &quot;Valayapathi&quot; have been found so far.

== Medieval literature ==

The medieval period was the period of the Chola Empire when the entire south India was under a single administration. The period between the 11th and the 13th centuries, during which the Chola power was at its peak, there were relatively few foreign incursions and the life for the Tamil people was one of peace and prosperity. It also provided the opportunity for the people to interact with cultures beyond their own, as the Cholas ruled over most of the South India, Sri Lanka and traded with the kingdoms in southeast Asia. The Cholas built numerous temples, mainly for their favourite god Shiva, and these were celebrated in numerous hymns. The &quot;Prabhanda&quot; became the dominant form of poetry. The religious canons of Shaiva and Vaishnava sects were beginning to be systematically collected and categorised. Nambi Andar Nambi, who was a contemporary of Rajaraja Chola I, collected and arranged the books on Saivism into eleven books called &quot;Tirumurais&quot;. The hagiology of Saivism was standardised in &quot;Periyapuranam&quot; (also known as &quot;Tiruttondar Puranam&quot;) by Sekkilar, who lived during the reign of Kulothunga Chola II (1133–1150 CE). Religious books on the Vaishnava sect were mostly composed in Sanskrit during this period. The great Vaishnava leader Ramanuja lived during the reigns of Athirajendra Chola and Kulothunga Chola I, and had to face religious persecution from the Cholas who belonged to the Saiva sect. One of the best known Tamil works of this period is the &quot;Ramavatharam&quot; by Kamban who flourished during the reign of Kulottunga III. &quot;Ramavatharam&quot; is the greatest epic in Tamil Literature, and although the author states that he followed Valmiki, his work is not a mere translation or even an adaptation of the Sanskrit epic. Kamban imports into his narration the colour and landscape of his own time. A contemporary of Kamban was the famous poet Auvaiyar who found great happiness in writing for young children. Her works, &quot;Athichoodi&quot; and &quot;Konraiventhan&quot; are even now generally read and taught in schools in Tamil Nadu. Her two other works, &quot;Mooturai&quot; and &quot;Nalvali&quot; were written for slightly older children. All the four works are didactic in character. They explain the basic wisdom that should govern mundane life.

Of the books on the Buddhist and the Jain faiths, the most noteworthy is the &quot;Jivaka-chintamani&quot; by the Jain ascetic Thirutakkadevar composed in the 10th century. &quot;Viruttam&quot; style of poetry was used for the first time for the verses in this book. The five Tamil epics &quot;Seevaka-chintamani&quot;, &quot;Silappatikaram&quot;, &quot;Manimekalai&quot;, &quot;Kundalakesi&quot; and &quot;Valayapathi&quot; are collectively known as The Five Great Epics of Tamil Literature. There were a number of books written on Tamil grammar. &quot;Yapperungalam&quot; and &quot;Yapperungalakkarigai&quot; were two works on prosody by the Jain ascetic Amirtasagara. Buddamitra wrote &quot;Virasoliyam&quot;, another work on Tamil grammar, during the reign of Virarajendra Chola. &quot;Virasoliyam&quot; attempts to find synthesis between Sanskrit and Tamil grammar. Other grammatical works of this period are &quot;Nannul&quot; by Pavanandi, &quot;Vaccanandi Malai&quot; by Neminatha, and the annotations on the puram theme, &quot;Purapporul Venpamalai&quot; by Aiyanaridanar.

There were biographical and political works such as Jayamkondar&#x27;s Kalingattuparani, a semi-historical account on the two invasions of Kalinga by Kulothunga Chola I. Jayamkondar was a poet-laureate in the Chola court and his work is a fine example of the balance between fact and fiction the poets had to tread. Ottakuttan, a close contemporary of Kambar, wrote three &quot;Ulas&quot; on Vikrama Chola, Kulothunga Chola II and Rajaraja Chola II.

== Vijayanagar and Nayak period ==
The period from 1300 CE to 1650 was a period of constant change in the political situation of Tamil Nadu. The Tamil country was invaded by the armies of the Delhi Sultanate and raided the Pandya kingdom. This overstretched the Delhi Sultanate to such an extent it collapsed soon after which triggered the rise of the Bahmani Sultans in the Deccan. Vijayanagar empire rose from the ashes of the kingdoms of Hoysalas and Chalukyas and eventually conquered the entire south India. The Vijayanagar kings appointed regional governors to rule various territories of their kingdom and Tamil Nadu was ruled by the Madurai Nayaks, Thanjavur Nayaks and Gingee Nayaks. This period saw a large output of philosophical works, commentaries, epics and devotional poems. A number of monasteries (&quot;Mathas&quot;) were established by the various Hindu sects and these began to play a prominent role in educating the people. Numerous authors were of either the Saiva or the Vaishnava sects. The Vijayanagar kings and their Nayak governors were ardent Hindus and they patronised these &quot;mathas&quot;. Although the kings and the governors of the Vijayanagar empire spoke Kannada and Telugu they encouraged the growth of Tamil literature as we find no slowing down in the literary output during this period.

There was a large output of works of philosophical and religious in nature, such as the &quot;Sivananabodam&quot; by Meykandar. At the end of the 14th century Svarupananda Desikar wrote two anthologies on the philosophy of &quot;Advaita&quot;, the &quot;Sivaprakasapperundirattu&quot;. Arunagirinathar who lived in Tiruvannamalai in the 14th century wrote &quot;Tiruppugal&quot;. Around 1360 verses of unique lilt and set to unique metres these poems are on the god Muruga. Madai Tiruvengadunathar, an official in the court of the Madurai Nayak, wrote &quot;Meynanavilakkam&quot; on the Advaita Vedanta. Siva prakasar, in the early 17th century wrote a number of works on the Saiva philosophy. Notable among these is the &quot;Nanneri&quot; which deals with moral instructions. A considerable par to the religious and philosophical literature of the age took the form of &quot;Puranas&quot; or narrative epics. A number of these were written on the various deities of the temples in Tamil Nadu and are known as Sthala Puranas, based on legend and folklore. One of the most important of the epics was the Mahabharatam by Villiputturar. He translated Vyasa&#x27;s epic into Tamil and named it &quot;Villibharatam&quot;. &quot;Kanthapuranam&quot; on the god Murugan was written by Kacchiappa Sivachariyar who lived in the 15th century. This work was based broadly on the Sanskrit &quot;Skandapurana&quot;. Varatungarama Pandya, a Pandya king of the period was a littérateur of merit and wrote &quot;Paditrruppattanthathi&quot;. He also translated into Tamil the erotic book known as &quot;Kokkoha&quot; from Sanskrit.

This period also an age of many commentaries of ancient Tamil works. Adiyarkunallar wrote an annotation on Cilappatikaram. Senavaraiyar wrote a commentary on the Tolkappiyam. Then came the famous Parimelalagar whose commentary on the Tirukkural is still considered one of the best available. Other famous annotators such as Perasiriyar and Naccinarikiniyar wrote commentaries on the various work of Sangam literature. The first Tamil dictionary was attempted by Mandalapurusha who compiled the lexicon &quot;Nigandu Cudamani&quot;. Thayumanavar, who lived in the early 18th century, is famous for a number of short poems of philosophical nature.

The 17th-century altruist Syed Khader, known colloquially as Seethakaathi, was a great patron of all Tamil poets. He commissioned Umaruppulavar to pen the first biography of Nabi. The collection of poems was called &quot;Seerapuranam&quot;. The 17th century also saw for the first time literary works by Christian authors. Costanzo Giuseppe Beschi (1680–1746), better known as Veeramamunivar, compiled the first dictionary in Tamil. His &quot;Chathurakarathi&quot; was the first to list the Tamil words in alphabetical order.

== Modern era ==

During the 18th and the 19th century, Tamil Nadu witnessed some of the most profound changes in the political scene. The traditional Tamil ruling clans were superseded by European colonists and their sympathisers. The Tamil society underwent a deep cultural shock with the imposition of Western cultural influences. The Hindu religious establishments attempted to stem the tide of change and to safeguard the Tamil cultural values. Notable among these were the Saiva monasteries at Tiruvavaduthurai, Dharmapuram, Thiruppananthal and Kundrakudi. Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai (1815–1876) was a Tamil scholar who taught Tamil at one of these monasteries. He wrote more than eighty books consisting of over 200,000 poems. He is more famous however for encouraging U. V. Swaminatha Iyer to go search for Tamil books that have been lost for centuries. 

Gopalakrishna Bharathi lived during the early 19th century. He wrote numerous poems and lyrics set to tune in Carnatic music. His most famous work is the &quot;Nandan Charitam&quot; on the life of Nandanar who, having been born in a sociologically lower caste, faces and overcomes the social obstacles in achieving his dream of visiting the Chidambaram temple. This work is a revolutionary social commentary considering the period in which it was written, although Gopalakrishna Bharati expanded on the story in &quot;Periyapuranam&quot;. Ramalinga Adigal (Vallalar) (1823–1874) wrote the devotional poem &quot;Tiruvarutpa&quot; is considered to be a work of great beauty and simplicity. Maraimalai Adigal (1876–1950) advocated for the purity of Tamil and wanted to clean it of words with Sanskrit influences. 

One of the great Tamil poets of this period was Subramanya Bharathi. His works are stimulating in their progressive themes like freedom and feminism. Bharathy introduced a new poetic style into the somewhat rigid style of Tamil poetry writing, which had followed the rules set down in the &quot;Tolkaappiyam&quot;. His &quot;puthukkavithai&quot; (Lit.:new poetry) broke the rules and gave poets the freedom to express themselves. He also wrote Tamil prose in the form of commentaries, editorials, short stories and novels. Some of these were published in the Tamil daily &quot;Swadesamitran&quot; and in his Tamil weekly &quot;India&quot;. Inspired by Bharathi, many poets resorted to poetry as a means of reform. Bharathidasan was one such poet. U.V.Swaminatha Iyer, was instrumental in the revival of interest in the Sangam age literature in Tamil Nadu. He travelled all over the Tamil country, collecting, deciphering and publishing ancient books such as &quot;Cilappatikaram&quot;, &quot;Kuruntokai&quot;, etc. He published over 90 books and wrote &quot;En caritham&quot;, an autobiography.

=== Tamil novel ===
The novel as a genre of literature arrived in Tamil in the third quarter of the 19th century, more than a century after it became popular with English writers. Its emergence was perhaps facilitated by the growing population of Tamils with a western education and exposure to popular English fiction. Mayavaram Vedanayagam Pillai wrote the first Tamil novel &quot;Prathapa Mudaliar Charithram&quot; in 1879. This was a romance with an assortment of fables, folk tales and even Greek and Roman stories, written with the entertainment of the reader as the principal motive. It was followed by &quot;Kamalambal Charitram&quot; by B. R. Rajam Iyer in 1893 and &quot;Padmavathi Charitram&quot; by A. Madhaviah in 1898. These two portray the life of Brahmins in 19th-century rural Tamil Nadu, capturing their customs and habits, beliefs and rituals. Although it was primarily a powerful narration of the common man&#x27;s life in a realistic style spiced with natural humour, Rajam Iyer&#x27;s novel has a spiritual and philosophical undertone. Madhaviah tells the story in a more realistic way with a searching criticism of the upper caste society, particularly the sexual exploitation of girls by older men. D. Jayakanthan has enriched the high traditions of literary traditions of Tamil language and contributed towards the shaping of Indian literature. His literature presents a deep and sensitive understanding of complex human nature and is an authentic and vivid index of Indian reality. One famous novel of his is &quot;Sila Nerangalil Sila Manithargal&quot;. Since the 1990s the post-modernist writers emerged as a major figures, including Jeyamohan, S.Ramakrishnan, Charu Nivedita, and Konangi, who mixes classical Tamil inflections with experimental sound poets.

There are other less appreciated works involving those translated from other languages, which are often unrecognized by Tamil pundits. The works include &quot;Urumaatram&quot; (translation of Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;), &quot;Siluvayil Thongum Saathaan&quot; (translation of &quot;Devil on the Cross&quot; by Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o), &quot;Thoongum azhagigalin Illam&quot; (translation of &quot;The House of the Sleeping Beauties&quot; by Yasunari Kawabata). Writers like Amarantha, Latha Ramakrishnan are responsible for these works.

=== Popular fiction ===
Crime and detective fiction has enjoyed wide popularity in Tamil Nadu since the 1930s. Popular authors in the years before independence included Kurumbur Kuppusami and Vaduvur Duraisami Iyengar. In the 1950s and 1960s, Tamilvanan&#x27;s detective hero Shankarlal carried readers to a variety of foreign locales, while using a pure Tamil with very few Hindi or English loan words. These writers are often extremely prolific, with hundreds or even thousands of short novels to their credit, and one or more short novel published in a monthly periodical. Indra Soundar Rajan, another popular modern author, writes supernatural crime thrillers usually based around Hindu mythology.

=== Modern Tamil novelists ===

In the 1940s and 1950s Kalki Krishnamurthy was notable for his historical and social fiction.

In the 1950s and 60s, Chandilyan wrote a number of very popular historical romance novels set in medieval India or on medieval trade routes with Malaysia, Indonesia and Europe.

From the 1950s, spanning six decades, Jayakanthan authored around 40 novels, 200 short stories, apart from two autobiographies. Outside literature, he made two films. In addition, four of his other novels were adapted into films by others. His works revolve around the lives of underclass people like rickshaw-pullers, prostitutes and rag-pickers.

Arunaa Nandhini is one of recent Tamil novelists who has entered the hearts of many Tamil readers, and her story covers family subject, romance, reality, with some humor added for the readers to enjoy their leisure.

Though sales of Tamil pulp fiction have declined since the hey-day of the mid-1990s, and many writers have turned to the more lucrative television serial market, there remains a thriving scene.

The rise of the Internet has triggered a dramatic growth in the number of Tamil blogs and specialist portals catering to political and social issues. Tamil literature is even available in the form of e-books.
Tamil literature boasts a rich tradition of novel writing, with many talented authors contributing to the literary landscape. Some prominent Tamil writers include: 

* Kalki Krishnamurthy (1899–1954)
* S. Ramakrishnan (1937–)
* Jayakanthan (1934–2015)
* Akilan (1922–1988)
* R. K. Narayan (1906–2001)
* C. Rajagopalachari (1878–1972)
* Pudhumaipithan (1906–1948)
* Sivasankari (1942–)
* R. Chudamani (1931–2010)

These writers have played a crucial role in shaping Tamil literature through their diverse themes and narrative styles.

=== Periodicals ===

The increasing demand of the literate public caused a number of journals and periodicals to be published and these in turn provided a platform for authors to publish their work. &quot;Rajavritti Bodhini&quot; and &quot;Dina Varthamani&quot; in 1855 and Salem Pagadala Narasimhalu Naidu&#x27;s fortnightlies, Salem &quot;Desabhimini&quot; in 1878 and &quot;Coimbatore Kalanidhi&quot; in 1880, were the earliest Tamil journals. In 1882, G. Subramaniya Iyer started the newspaper &quot;Swadesamitran&quot;. It became the first Tamil daily in 1889. This was the start of many journals to follow and many novelists began to serialise their stories in these journal. The humour magazine &quot;Ananda Vikatan&quot; started by S.S. Vasan in 1929 was to help create some of the greatest Tamil novelists. Kalki Krishnamurthy (1899–1954) serialised his short stories and novels in &quot;Ananda Vikatan&quot; and eventually started his own weekly &quot;Kalki&quot; for which he wrote the enduringly popular novels &quot;Parthiban Kanavu&quot;, &quot;Sivagamiyin Sabadham&quot; and &quot;Ponniyin Selvan&quot;. Pudhumaipithan (1906–1948) was a great writer of short stories and provided the inspiration for a number of authors who followed him. The &#x27;new poetry or &quot;pudukkavithai&quot; pioneered by Bharathi in his prose-poetry was further developed by the literary periodicals &quot;manikkodi&quot; and &quot;ezhuttu&quot; (edited by Si Su Chellappa). Poets such as Mu. Metha contributed to these periodicals. Tamil Muslim poets like Kavikko Abdul Rahman, Pavalar Inqulab, Manushyaputhiran and Rajathi Salma too have made significant contributions to social reforms. The pioneering fortnightly journal &quot;Samarasam&quot; was established in 1981 to highlight and cater to the ethnic Tamil Muslim community&#x27;s issues.
Another remarkable work was done in Tamil novel field by Mu.Varatharasanar.[Agal vilakku] [Karithundu]. And last but not least Akilan the unique Tamil novelist, short story writer and a social activist is famous for his works like &#x27;Chithirapavai&#x27; &#x27;Vengayinmaindan&#x27; &#x27;Pavaivilaku&#x27;.

== Tamil journalism ==

The first Tamil periodical was published by the Christian Religious Tract Society in 1831 – &quot;The Tamil Magazine&quot;.

The increasing demand of the literate public caused a number of journals and periodicals to be published and these in turn provided a platform for authors to publish their work. Rajavritti Bodhini and Dina Varthamani in 1855 and Salem Pagadala Narasimhalu Naidu&#x27;s fortnightlies, Salem Desabhimini in 1878 and Coimbatore Kalanidhi in 1880, were the earliest Tamil journals.

The first regular newspaper in Tamil was Swadesamitran in 1882, started by G.Subramaniya Iyer, editor and sponsor of The Hindu and founding member of the Indian National Congress. He created a whole new Tamil political vocabulary. He was conscious that those with a knowledge of English are fewer in number and those with a knowledge of Indian languages make the vast majority. He felt that unless the people were told about the objectives of British rule and its merits and defects in the Indian languages, their political knowledge would never develop. When Subramania Aiyer quit The Hindu 1898, he made the Swadesamitran his full-time business. In 1899, the first Tamil daily. It was to enjoy this status for 17 years.

Subramania Aiyer&#x27;s &quot;pugnacious style, never qualifying words to soften the sharp tenor of a sentence,&quot; his use of words &quot;dipped in a paste of extra pungent green chillies,&quot; made the Swadesamitran sought by Tamils wherever they lived in the world. And the daily became even more popular when Subramania Bharati joined it in 1904. The next year, when Lala Lajpat Rai was arrested and agitation followed in the Punjab, Subramania Aiyer&#x27;s attitude to the British changed and he became a trenchant political critic of the Raj. His whole political mantra can be summed up in these words: `Peaceful but tireless and unceasing effort.&#x27; Let us sweat ourselves into Swaraj, he would seem to say.&quot; Swadesamitran is credited for coining new Tamil words to deal with science, politics and administration. It had the most comprehensive budget of news among all the regional language papers of that time.

In 1917, &quot;Desabhaktan&quot;, another Tamil daily began with T.V. Kalyansundara Menon as editor. He was succeeded by V.V.S. Iyer, a colleague of the Savarkar brothers. These two editors were scholars with a natural, highly readable but polished style of writing.

The freedom movement and the advent of Gandhi also impacted Tamil journalism. Navasakthi, a Tamil periodical edited by Tamil scholar and freedom fighter V. Kalyanasundaram. C.Rajagopalachari began Vimochanam, a Tamil journal devoted to propagating prohibition at the Gandhi Ashram in Tiruchengode in Salem district.

In 1926, P. Varadarajulu Naidu, who was conducting a Tamil news-cum-views weekly &#x27;Tamil Nadu&#x27; started a daily with the same name. Its forceful and colloquial style gained it a wide readership but after the paper failed to take sides with the 1930 Civil Disobedience Movement, the Congress Party decided to bring out a new Tamil daily – India, edited by renowned poet Subramania Bharati. India showed great promise but could not establish itself financially, and folded up soon after Bharati was exiled to Pondicherry. All these papers were published from Madras.

In 1933, the first Tamil tabloid – the 8 page Jayabharati began at a price of anna. It closed in 1940 as the price could not sustain even its postage.

In September 1934, S. Sadanand (who was running The Free Press Journal) started the Tamil daily Dinamani with T.S. Chockalingam as editor. It was priced at 6 pies, contained bright features and was fearlessly critical. It was highly successful and its circulation eclipsed the total circulation of all other Tamil dailies. Soon &#x27;India&#x27; was incorporated into Dinamani. Dinamani made a studied and conscious effort to make the contents of a newspaper intelligible even to the newly literate.
In 1935, Viduthalai was begun, but it was more of a views-paper than a newspaper.
The Non-Brahman Movement also gave an impetus to Tamil journalism. Newspapers like the &quot;Bharat Devi&quot; were strong supporters of this movement.

Many magazines began in Tamil Nadu during the 1920s and &#x27;30s. The humour magazine Ananda Vikatan started by S.S. Vasan in 1929 was to help create some of the greatest Tamil novelists. It is still running successfully after 80 years and the Vikatan group today also publishes Chutti Vikatan, Junior Vikatan, Motor Vikatan and other special interest magazines. R. Krishnamurthy serialised his short stories and novels in Ananda Vikatan and eventually started his own weekly Kalki. The name Kalki denotes the impending tenth Avatar of Lord Vishnu in the Hindu religion, who it is said, will bring to an end the Kali Yuga and reinstate Dharma or righteousness among the worldly beings. He used the name because he wanted to bring about liberation of India.

In 1942, Dina Thanthi (&quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;) was started in Madurai with simultaneous editions in Madras, Salem and Tiruchirappalli. It was founded by S.P. Adithanar, a lawyer trained in Britain. He modeled Thanthi on the style of an English tabloid- The Daily Mirror. He aimed to bring out a newspaper that ordinary people would read, and which would encourage a reading habit even among the newly literate. In the past, the daily newspaper which was printed in Madras reached the southern Tamil region after at least one day. Thanthi used the public bus system to distribute the paper throughout the south Tamil region and capitalized on the hunger for war news that arose after Singapore fell to the Japanese. Due to financial constraints, its Salem and Tiruchirappalli editions had to be closed down for a while. Thanthi emphasized local news, especially crime and the courts. It used photographs extensively and brought banner headlines to Tamil journalism. It could fit one story on an entire broadsheet page, mainly filled with large easy-to-read headlines. One of its biggest scoops was the murder of the editor of a scandalous film magazine by two actors. Thanthi covered the trial in Madras in detail, and its reporters phoned the daily account to the printing centre in Madurai. Thanthi was the first Tamil paper to understand the people’s fascination with crime and film stars. The paper was popular and it was said that Tamils learned to read in order to read the newspaper.

Dina Thanthi became one of the largest Tamil language dailies by circulation within a few years; it has been a leading Tamil daily since the 1960s. It has today 14 editions. It is the highest circulated Tamil daily in Bangalore and Pondicherry. It issues a book called 10th, +2 Vina Vidai Book, on every Wednesday during the second part of the year. The model question papers of all the subjects of Standard 10 and 12 are provided with answers along with the question papers of board exams that are conducted previous year.

<text>Kamala Nehru Park is part of the Hanging Gardens complex in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India covering an area of approximate 16,000 sq.mt. (4 acres). Located at the top of Mumbai&#x27;s Malabar Hill, it is developed and maintained by the Hydraulic Engineer&#x27;s Department of Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. One of Mumbai&#x27;s premier gardens it is popular with young children and tourists. The garden has views of the Marine drive below - also known as Queen&#x27;s necklace.

The shoe structure is inspired by the nursery rhyme &quot;There was an Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe&quot;.

Soli Arceivala, Former BMC Environment Officer, VJTI Vice Principal Of 15 Years, NEERI Director had designed Old Woman&#x27;s Shoe at Kamala Nehru Park.

== History ==
Established in 1952, Kamala Nehru Park has been an integral part of Mumbai&#x27;s urban landscape for decades. The park is named in honor of Kamala Nehru, a freedom fighter and the wife of Jawaharlal Nehru, who played a significant role in India&#x27;s struggle for independence.

=== Renovation ===
In 2017 and 2018, the park was rejuvenated and opened for public on 22 February 2018 by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai.
Continuing the theme of &#x27;Nursery Rhymes&#x27; the park now has additional spaces designed on various other nursery rhymes in Marathi, Hindi and English.

<text>The Hanging Gardens, in Mumbai (still widely known as Bombay), also known as [[Pherozeshah Mehta]] Gardens, are terraced gardens perched at the top of Malabar Hill, on its western side, just opposite the Kamala Nehru Park. They provide sunset views over the Arabian Sea and feature numerous hedges carved into the shapes of animals. The park was designed and laid out in 1881 by Ulhas Ghatkopar over Bombay&#x27;s main reservoir, some say to cover the water from the potentially contaminating activity of the nearby Towers of Silence. When seen from the air, the walkway inside the park (Hanging Gardens Path), spell out the letters PMG (Pherozeshah Mehta Gardens) in cursive.

<doc id="372998" wikidata="Q17146503" url="?curid=372998" title="Phosphatization">
<text>Phosphatization, or phosphatic fossilization, refers to the process of fossilization where organic matter is replaced by abundant calcium-phosphate minerals. It has occurred in unusual circumstances to preserve some extremely high-resolution microfossils in which careful preparation can even reveal preserved cellular structures. Such microscopic fossils are only visible under the scanning electron microscope.

== Mechanism ==
Large quantities of phosphate are required, either from seawater or from the tissues of the decaying organism. In some cases microbes control the phosphatization, and the remains of the microbes that feed on the preserved tissue form the fossil. In others, the tissue itself is the source of phosphate and its phosphatized remains form the fossil. In the intermediate case the phosphatized tissue retains the impressions of the phosphatizing microbes.

== Phosphatic preservation in Burgess Shale-type fossils ==

Soft-tissue fossils, such as those found in the Burgess Shale, are rare. In some cases their internal organs are replicated in phosphate. The phosphate mainly comes from the tissue itself, and may later be replaced by calcium carbonate. A low pH makes CaCO3 less likely to precipitate, clearing the way for phosphate to be laid down. This is facilitated by the absence of oxygen in the decaying tissue. Accordingly, (secondary) phosphate is generally only preserved in enclosed spaces, such as a tightly-closed bivalve shell.

Higher concentrations of phosphate in the sea water do not enhance phosphatization, as may seem natural; rather, it increases the rate at which the organism breaks up, perhaps because the mineral &quot;fertilizes&quot; the decay micro-organisms.

Phosphatization can happen quickly: The chitinous structures that support bivalve gills can be replaced by calcium phosphate, with a little help from co-occurring bacteria, in just two to six days. The gill axes and musculature of bivalves can also be preserved in phosphate.
The structures that are most famously preserved in phosphate in the Burgess Shale are the midgut glands of &quot;Leanchoilia&quot;, perhaps on account of their central position and plausibly a low pH.

Phosphatization can be microbially mediated, especially in decay-resistant groups such as arthropods; or substrate-dominated, where phosphate-rich tissue leads the mineralization process (as in fish). Cephalopods fall somewhere between these two extremes.

== Phosphate-only fossils==
In phosphatic fossils, the preservation is so fine that even some cellular structure has been preserved. The phosphatic microfossils of the Doushantuo Formation, a fossil-rich lagerstätte of the Ediacaran period, about 590–565 Ma (megaannua; million years ago), display some of the most spectacular cellular-level preservation known from the geologic record. The fossils include what may be metazoan blastulas, possibly animal embryos at an early stage in cell division.

The Doushantuo Formation presents a classic example of phosphatic fossilization:
:&#x27;This high-resolution fossil bed is about 30% phosphate, present as the mineral fluorapatite [Ca5(PO4)3F]. Phosphatic beds within this deposit are grainstones composed of 1- to 5-mm phosphoclasts. These derive from a phosphatic surface that formed on the sea floor, in the process of recrystallizing existing surface sediments. In addition to replacing carbonate sediments, soft tissues of metazoan embryos, larvae, adults, and algae also appear to have been mineralized. The phosphatized sediment crust was then broken into small fragments by heavy current activity and then redeposited and mixed in with adjacent lime muds. Careful acid baths etch away the limestone matrices, by slowly dissolving the carbonates, and reveal the phosphates that have replaced organic structures, in the manner that Dr. Chen describes. There are other means of fossilization represented in the Doushantuo Formation as well.

A refinement to viewing the internal structure of fossilized embryos uses specialized microscopic three-dimensional X-ray computed tomography, a kind of micro CAT scan.

<doc id="372999" wikidata="Q912081" url="?curid=372999" title="White-crowned wheatear">
<text>The white-crowned wheatear, or white-crowned black wheatear (Oenanthe leucopyga) is a wheatear, a small passerine bird that was formerly classed as a member of the thrush family Turdidae, but is now more generally considered to be an Old World flycatcher, Muscicapidae.

== Description ==
This large 17–18 cm long wheatear breeds in stony deserts from the Sahara and Arabia across to Iraq. It is largely resident but has occurred as a rare vagrant to western Europe as far away as Great Britain. It nests in crevices in rocks or walls laying 3-5 eggs.

Although most wheatear species have distinctive male and female plumages, adults of both sexes of this species are black except for a white rump and mainly white tail. Full adults have a white crown, not shown by young birds.

The similar black wheatear, &quot;Oenanthe leucura&quot;, also breeds in the western part of the white-crowned wheatear&#x27;s range, but the latter has a black inverted T on its white tail, whereas white-crowned has only a black centre to its tail. The black wheatear never has a white crown.

This species mainly eats insects. This wheatear has a loud song, more varied than most of its relatives and often including mimicry.


==Etymology==
The genus name &quot;Oenanthe&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;oenos&quot; (οίνος) &quot;wine&quot; and &quot;anthos&quot; (ανθός) &quot;flower&quot;. It refers to the northern wheatear&#x27;s return to Greece in the spring just as the grapevines blossom. The specific &quot;leucopyga&quot; is Ancient Greek from &quot;leukos&quot;, &quot;white&quot;, and &quot;puge&quot;, &quot;rump&quot;. &quot;Wheatear&quot; is not derived from &quot;wheat&quot; or any sense of &quot;ear&quot;, but is a 16th-century linguistic corruption of &quot;white&quot; and &quot;arse&quot;, referring to the prominent white rump found in many species.

<doc id="373004" wikidata="Q152902" url="?curid=373004" title="Tanga, Tanzania">
<text>Tanga (&quot;Jiji la Tanga&quot;, in Swahili) is a historic city and the capital of Tanga Region. The city is located in the northern port city of Tanzania to the west of the Indian Ocean on Tanga Bay. The city had a population of 393,429 in 2022 and is governed by the Tanga City Council. The city is also a home to the Port of Tanga. The name &quot;Tanga&quot; means &quot;sail&quot; in Swahili. The city is also the capital of Tanga District.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Due to close proximity to the equator and the warm Indian Ocean, the city experiences tropical climatic conditions similar to all Tanzanian coastal cities. The city experiences hot and humid weather throughout much of the year and has a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen: &quot;Aw&quot;). Annual rainfall is approximately 1,290 mm (51 in), and in a normal year there are two rainy seasons: &quot;the long rains&quot; in April and May and &quot;the short rains&quot; in November and December.

==Economy==
Major exports from the port of Tanga include sisal, coffee, tea, and cotton. Tanga is also an important railroad terminus, connecting much of the northern Tanzanian interior with the sea via the Tanzania Railways Corporation&#x27;s Link Line and Central Line. Tanga is linked to the African Great Lakes region and the Tanzanian economic capital of Dar es Salaam. The city is served by Tanga Airport.The harbour and surrounding is the centre of life in Tanga. It has several markets in several neighbourhoods.Tanga Cement is one of the major industries.

===Infrastructure===

====Air connectivity====

Tanga has a small airport and is currently served by only three regional airlines, providing scheduled services to Dar es Salaam, Pemba Island and Zanzibar. In 2014 the airport served less than 30,000 passengers. There are also a small number of private airstrips in the surrounding area around the city that facilitate the private estates and surrounding industries.

====Road connectivity====
Tanga city lies approximately 250 km from Chalinze on the A14 highway that runs from Chalinze to Mombasa. The town is 75 km away from Segera which is a junction linking the A14 and the B1. The B1 highway is a bypass that links Moshi and the northern corridor to Tanga.

====Port of Tanga====

The port is historically the oldest operating harbour in the nation and its roots date back to around the 6th century. The Port of Tanga is the second largest port in Tanzania and is a vital part to the city&#x27;s initial development and economy. The port operates at 90% of its installed capacity and its main cargo is coal for the cement industry and is a new gateway for crude oil products. The ports authority has major plans to upgrade the port in increasing its capacity and providing an alternative route for cargo flowing into the country.

====Rail connectivity====
Tanga is the starting point of the narrow gauge northern railway network that ends in Arusha. Construction of this line was started in the 19th century by the Germans. In 2018, the Government of Tanzania invested 5.7 billion Tanzanian Shillings to rehabilitate the line. As of July 2019, diesel powered cargo trains are leaving Tanga Railway Station again and passenger transport between Tanga and Arusha is set to start in September 2019.

==History==
===Early history===
The first communities that called Tanga their home were the Digo people and the Swahili states of the 11th to 16th Centuries. However, the earliest documentation about Tanga comes from the Portuguese. During their disruption of the previous trading links Tanga settlement remained a small trading post for the colonists during their occupation of the East African coast for 200 years between 1500 and 1700 when they were ousted . The Sultanate of Oman battled the Portuguese and gained control of the settlement by mid-1700 along with Mombasa, Pemba Island and Kilwa Kisiwani. The town continued to act as a trading port for ivory and slaves under the sultan&#x27;s rule. Tanga continued to be a prosperous trading hub for slaves with the Arab world until 1873 when the European powers invaded and occupied thus abolishing the slave trade that was no longer serving the colonial powers.

===Tanga under German East Africa===
In the 19th Century, growing interests by Europeans for the Scramble for Africa brought the Germans to Tanga. The Germans bought the coastal strip of mainland Tanzania from the Sultan of Zanzibar in 1891. This takeover designated Tanga into a township and was the first establishment in German East Africa. The town became the centre of German colonial administration before the establishment of Dar es Salaam in the early 20th century.

Tanga was chosen in 1889 as a military post of German East Africa, and it became a district office in 1891. The town saw rapid expansion and planned growth under the German occupation. A tram line was built in the city for domestic transport and a port was also built for exports. In 1896 the construction of the Usambara Railway began and was extended to Moshi by 1912. Roads, bridges and the railway enabled industrial growth in the region and many buildings and bridges that are still in operation today in the town are from the German colonial period. The local economy was based mainly on the production of sisal, which had been brought to the colony several years earlier, and population in the area grew rapidly.

=== Tanga under British occupation===
As the coastal town closest to British East Africa, Tanga was on the front line of the East African campaign at the beginning of World War I. On 4 November 1914 a landing by British and Empire forces was repelled in the Battle of Tanga. On 13 June 1916 the Royal Navy battleship and protected cruisers and bombarded Tanga. On 7 July the protected cruiser and monitor entered Manza Bay and put troops ashore who occupied the town. After the War, Britain was given a League of Nations Mandate to prepare Tanganyika for independence and continued to develop Tanga in order to develop its agricultural potential, both to feed the population and so stave of the regular famines in the tetritory and for export. In 1919 Tanga was the country&#x27;s fourth largest city, but at independence it was the second largest city after Dar es Salaam.

===Post-independence===
In the early stages of independence, the Port of Tanga continued to be a gateway for the export of sisal from the region. However, following the adopting of the Ujamaa policy, global prices in sisal dwindling, the production that served the city&#x27;s factories closed and the city lost its main source of income. With the government controlling the agriculture trade and the depreciation in the world prices of sisal the port began to lose revenue.

==Healthcare==
Tanga city medical institutions include:
*Bombo Regional Hospital
*National Institute of Medical Research Centre, Tanga
*Amani Biomedical Research Laboratory
*Tanga AIDS Working Group

==Tourist sites==
Nearby tourist attractions include Amboni Caves, Galanos hot springs, Saadani national park, Toten Island, URITHI Tanga Museum, war graves and memorials, Tongoni Ruins, Ndumi Village defense works, Mwarongo sand beaches and protected coastal mangroves.

==Sport==
Tanga is represented in the Tanzanian Premier League by football clubs Coastal Union, JKT Mgambo, and African Sports (Wana Kimanumanu) from the 2015–2016 season.

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Tanga is twinned with:
* Eckernförde, Germany (1963)
* Kemi, Finland (2007)
* Tifariti, Western Sahara
* Toledo, United States (2001)

<text>Gṛhastha (Sanskrit: गृहस्थ) literally means &quot;being in and occupied with home, family&quot; or &quot;householder&quot;. It refers to the second phase of an individual&#x27;s life in a four age-based stages of the Hindu asrama system. It follows celibacy (bachelor student) life stage, and embodies a married life, with the duties of maintaining a home, raising a family, educating one&#x27;s children, and leading a family-centred and a dharmic social life.

This stage of &quot;Asrama&quot; is conceptually followed by &quot;Vānaprastha&quot; (forest dweller, retired) and &quot;Sannyasa&quot; (renunciation). Combined with other three life stages, Hindu philosophy considers these stages as a facet of Dharma concept, something essential to completing the full development of a human being and fulfilling all the needs of the individual and society.

Ancient and medieval era texts of Hinduism consider &quot;Gṛhastha&quot; stage as the most important of all stages in sociological context, as human beings in this stage not only pursue a virtuous life, they produce food and wealth that sustains people in other stages of life, as well as the offspring that continues mankind. The householder stage is also considered in Indian philosophy as one where the most intense physical, procreational, emotional, occupational, social and material attachments exist in a human being&#x27;s life.

In Indian traditions, &quot;Gṛhastha&quot; stage of life is a recommendation, but not a requirement. Any &quot;Brahmachari&quot; may, if they want, skip householder and retirement stage, go straight to Sannyasa stage of life, thereby renouncing worldly and materialistic pursuits and dedicating their lives to spiritual pursuits.

==Etymology==
The Sanskrit word &quot;grhastha&quot; (गृहस्थ) is a composite &quot;grha-stha&quot; of two root words &quot;grha&quot; (गृह) and &quot;stha&quot; (स्थ). &quot;Grha&quot; means &quot;home, family, house&quot;, while &quot;sth&quot; means &quot;devoted to, occupied with, being in&quot;. &quot;Gṛhastha&quot; means that which &quot;being in and occupied with home, family&quot; or simply &quot;householder&quot;.

==Discussion==
Gṛhastha is part of the ancient Hindu concept called Chaturashrama, which identified four stages of a human life, with distinct differences based on natural human needs and drives, as well as how these &quot;stages&quot; integrated with fulfilling, joyful four &quot;goals&quot; of life called Purushartha - Dharma (piety, morality, duties), Artha (wealth, health, means of life), Kama (love, relationships, emotions) and Moksha (liberation, freedom, self-realization). Gṛhastha is considered to be the most intense of all four stages, where a man or woman pursues all four goals of life, with greater emphasis on first three - Dharma, Artha and Kama. In contrast, Sannyasa is the stage where the individual renounces Artha and Kama, and pursues Moksha with a single minded pursuit.

The stage &quot;Gṛhastha&quot; is preceded by Brahmacharya (student) stage of life, and followed by Vanaprastha (retirement, forest dweller, still an advisor to the next generation) stage. In ancient texts, Gṛhastha stage of life is said to extend from the age of about 25 to about 50.

A man or woman entered the &quot;Gṛhastha&quot; stage after a Hindu wedding [sacred ceremony]. They would build a home, raise a family, earn wealth, enjoy worldly life and give donations to needy people, poor families, orphans, etc... They also have to follow the 5 great rituals ( Pancha Maha Yajnas) as follow:

# Brahma yajna~ Study of vedas, meditation, prayers
# Deva yajna~ Offering of clarified butter (ghee) in fire
# Pitr yajna~ Care of parents, aged and old people
# Bhuta yajna~ Service to poor, needy, handicapped and animals
# Atithi yajna~ Hospitality to guest, saints, sages. It is said &quot;Guest is God.&quot; We must take good care of our guest to get good deeds in our life.

==Literature==
The Chandogya Upanishad and Vedānta Sūtras discuss all four stages of life - student, householder, retired/hermit and ascetic. However they hold Gṛhastha āśrama as the highest because, explains verse III.4.48, not only does the householder performs the duties recommended for all four asramas, they have to produce food and goods on which people in other ashramas survive. The shared duties of four ashramas are - tenderness for all living creatures (ahimsa), self-restraints, and others.

Some chapters of the Upanishads, for example hymn 4.4.22 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, specify only three stages of human life – Brahmacharya, Gṛhastha and Vanaprastha. They make no mention of gender, class restrictions on these stages of life. All three stages are recommended as path to Brahman (inner Self, Soul). In contrast, later texts specify four stages of human life.

;Dharmasutras and Dharmasmritis
Grihastha ashrama, declares Gautama Dharmasutra in verses 3.2 and 3.3, is the foundation of all the ashramas, and essential to the existence and continuation of society because the other three ashramas do not produce offspring.

Manusmriti, similarly states in Sections VI.87 through VI.90, that it is the householders who feed all those in other three stages of life, and those who seek spiritual pursuits live on, attain fulfillment because of those who accept and prosper in Gṛhastha ashrama. Manusmriti uses the concept of ashrama broadly, and in verses III.77 to III.80, declares Gṛhastha stage as noble, excellent and that &quot;just like all beings need air to survive, so do all beings take life from the &quot;Gṛhastha Āśrama&quot; because of the food they produce and knowledge they apply&quot;.

In Sections IV.1 through IV.6, Manusmriti states a Brahmana, after being twice-born and completing his studies with his teacher, should marry and live in his house. He must seek a means of living that causes no injury or least possible injury to all living beings, except in times of distress. For this householder stage, the text declares that the Brahmana (graduate from Brahmacharya) should accumulate property by ethically pursuing his varna&#x27;s (class) occupation. Manusmriti lists five appropriate sources of income or means for survival for the educated Brahmana - Ṛta (ऋत, lawful gleaning and gathering, proper natural work), Amrta (अमृत, accepting gifts and charity), Mrta (मृत, begging), Pramrta (प्रमृत, agriculture, tillage) and Satyanrta (सत्यानृत, trade, commerce, money lending). The text disapproves of one means of survival for the householder - Shvavritti (श्ववृत्ति, dog-like subsistence, servitude, slavery).

;Puranas
The Vishnu Purana in Book 3 Chapter IX, states

;Epics
The Indian Epics have extensive debates on Gṛhastha stage of life, offering a contrasting spectrum of views on its merits and nature. An illustrative recommended guidelines for conduct in householder stage of life is stated in Book 1, the Adi Parva of the Mahabharata, as follows,

<text>The black wheatear (Oenanthe leucura) is a wheatear, a small passerine bird in the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae. It is found in the Iberian Peninsula and western North Africa.

==Taxonomy==
The black wheatear was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the thrushes in the genus &quot;Turdus&quot;, coined the binomial name &quot;Turdus leucurus&quot; and specified the locality as Gibraltar. The specific epithet is from Ancient Greek &quot;leukouros&quot; meaning &quot;white-tailed&quot;. Gmelin based his account on the &quot;White-tailed thrush&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1783 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his multi-volume work &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. Latham had examined a specimen in the Leverian Museum in London. The black wheatear is now placed in the genus &quot;Oenanthe&quot; that was introduced in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;O. l. leucura&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – Portugal, Spain and south France
* &quot;O. l. riggenbachi&quot; (Hartert, EJO, 1909) – northwest Africa

==Description==
This large 16–18 cm long wheatear. The male of this species is all black except a white rump and mainly white tail. The female is similar, but dark brown rather than black. It has a loud thrush-like song.

The similar white-crowned wheatear (&quot;Oenanthe leucopyga&quot;) also breeds in the African part of the black wheatear&#x27;s range, but the black wheatear has a black inverted &quot;T&quot; on its white tail, whereas white-crowned has only a black centre to its tail. The black wheatear never has a white crown, but young white-crowned wheatears also lack this feature.

==Behaviour==

It breeds on cliffs and rocky slopes in western north Africa and Iberia. It no longer breeds in southern France. It is largely resident and nests in crevices in rocks laying 3-6 eggs.
The food of this wheatear is mainly insects.

<doc id="373016" wikidata="Q3560707" url="?curid=373016" title="Haircut (finance)">
<text>In finance, a haircut is the difference between the current market value of an asset and the value ascribed to that asset for purposes of calculating regulatory capital or loan collateral. The amount of the haircut reflects the perceived risk of the asset falling in value in an immediate cash sale or liquidation. The larger the risk or volatility of the asset price, the larger the haircut.

For example, United States Treasury bills, which are relatively safe and highly liquid assets, have little or no haircut, whereas more volatile or less marketable assets might have haircuts as high as 50%. 

Lower haircuts allow for more leverage. Haircut plays an important role in many kinds of trades, such as repurchase agreements (referred to in debt-instrument finance as &quot;repo&quot; but not to be confused with the concept of repossession denoted by that term in consumer finance) and reverse repurchase agreements (&quot;reverse repo&quot; in debt-instrument finance).

In mass media, as well as in economics texts, especially after the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the term &quot;haircut&quot; has been used mostly to denote a reduction of the amount that will be repaid to creditors, or, in other words, a reduction in the face value of a troubled borrower&#x27;s debts, as in &quot;to take a haircut&quot;: to accept or receive less than is owed. In 2012, world media was reporting on the &quot;biggest debt-restructuring deal in history&quot;, which included the &quot;very large haircut&quot; of some &quot;70 percent of par value&quot; of Greek state bonds, in NPV terms.

==SEC net capital rule==
The financial term &quot;haircut&quot; began, and continues to be used, as a reference to valuation discounts applied under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#x27;s net capital rule. The net capital rule was adopted to provide safeguards for public investors by setting standards of financial responsibility to be met by broker-dealers and requires a broker-dealer to have at all times sufficient liquid assets to cover its current indebtedness. The SEC explained the role of haircuts in calculating net capital in 1967:

In computing &quot;net capital,&quot; the rule requires deductions from &quot;net worth&quot; of certain specified percentages of the market values of marketable securities and future commodity contracts, long and short, in the capital and proprietary accounts of the broker or dealer, and in the &quot;accounts of partners.&quot; (These deductions are generally referred to in the industry as &quot;haircuts.&quot;) . . . The purpose of these deductions from &quot;net worth,&quot; is to provide a margin of safety against losses incurred by a broker or dealer as a result of market fluctuations in the prices of such securities or future commodity contracts.

&quot;Haircut&quot; since has been extended to a number of other financial contexts, whenever it is desirable to show that some securities (typically debt securities) are being valued for some purpose at a discount.

==ECB use of haircuts==
The European Central Bank applies a haircut to all securities offered as collateral. The size of the haircut depends on the riskiness and liquidity of the security offered as collateral.

==LTCM and haircut fees==
The hedge fund Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) saw spectacular losses that led to its dissolution in 1998. It had previously been able to trade with little collateral on positions that were considered safe by its lenders.

==As used for exchange-traded products==
When used in the context of exchange traded products such as stocks, options, or futures, haircut is used interchangeably with the term margin. It is the amount of capital required by a broker to maintain the positions currently in a trading account. If haircut exceeds the account&#x27;s capital, the broker can either require additional capital (e.g., margin call), or liquidate positions until the haircut no longer exceeds available capital.

==In sovereign debt write-downs==
During the Eurozone crisis, and particularly in the context of the Greek financial crisis, the term &quot;haircut&quot; acquired more specifically the meaning of state-debt holders receiving less than par. It&#x27;s &quot;the market&#x27;s euphemism for wiping out a large portion of the debt owed to the creditors&quot;.
The haircut agreed to by Greek-state debt holders was deemed &quot;voluntary&quot; by the banks&#x27; chief negotiator Charles Dallara, although, in order to convince domestic bond holders, the Greek government &quot;made it clear that holdouts would not receive a sweeter deal&quot;, while it also declared that if the haircut was not completed, the Greek state would not be able to &quot;further service its debt&quot;.

<text>Yangshuo County () is a county under the jurisdiction of Guilin City, in the northeast of Guangxi, China. Its seat is located in Yangshuo Town. Surrounded by karst peaks and bordered on one side by the Li River, it is served by bus and by boat from nearby Guilin.

==History==
In the 1980s, the county became popular with foreign visitors engaging in backpacker tourism, and organized tours began by the late 1990s. At the time, domestic tourists represented only a small fraction of the county&#x27;s visitors, but they outnumbered foreign tourists by 2005. Today, the county is a resort destination for both domestic and foreign travelers.

The history of West Street dates back over 1,400 years ago. Since the street is popular with locals and foreigners alike, signs are written in both Chinese and English. Because of the relatively high number of foreign visitors, many locals speak some English, unlike most Chinese towns of its size.

The Yangshuo region has numerous locations for climbing, and they are accessible by bicycle, public bus, or taxi van. The most famous of these crags is Moon Hill, which has several lines graded 5.13 in the Yosemite scale. Other crags of note include Low Mountain, Twin Gates, Baby Frog, the Egg, Bamboo Grove, and Wine Bottle Cliff.

==Administrative divisions==
Yangshuo County is divided into 6 towns and 3 townships:

<doc id="373023" wikidata="Q897318" url="?curid=373023" title="Brahmacharya">
<text>Brahmacharya (; Devanagari: ) is the concept within Indian religions that literally means &quot;conduct consistent with Brahman&quot; or &quot;on the path of Brahman&quot;. Brahmacharya, a discipline of controlling the senses, is seen as a way to liberation. Though sexual restraint is a part of brahmacharya, brahmacharya encompasses all striving toward a passionless state. 

In one context, &quot;brahmacharya&quot; is the first of four &quot;ashrama&quot; (age-based stages) of a human life. The &quot;brahmacharya&quot; (bachelor student) stage of life – from childhood up to twenty-five years of age – was focused on education and included the practice of celibacy. In this context, it connotes chastity during the student stage of life for the purposes of learning from a &quot;guru&quot; (teacher), and during later stages of life for the purposes of attaining spiritual liberation or moksha.

In the Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist monastic traditions, &quot;brahmacharya&quot; implies, among other things, the mandatory renunciation of sex and marriage. It is considered necessary for a monk&#x27;s spiritual practice.

== Etymology ==
The word stems from two Sanskrit roots:
# (Devanagari: ) meaning one&#x27;s own Self in non-dual schools or a distinct entity in dualistic schools, ultimate unchanging reality, absolute consciousness, much discussed in the Upanishads. 
# (), which means activity, behaviour, conduct.

Hence, roughly means &quot;to stay true to one&#x27;s Self or one own &quot; or &quot;on the path of &quot;n&quot;&quot;.

In ancient and medieval era Indian texts, the term is a concept with a more complex meaning, indicating a lifestyle conducive to the pursuit of sacred knowledge and spiritual liberation. is a means, not an end. It usually includes cleanliness, , simple living, studies, meditation, and voluntary restraints on certain foods (eating only Sattvic food), intoxicants, and on sexual behavior (both sex and masturbation, in some schools of thought).

One who practices &quot;brahmacarya&quot; is known as a &quot;brahmacārī&quot; or &quot;brahmacārinī.&quot; Various (, ) and (, ) of Hinduism also call their initiates by these terms.

== In Hinduism ==
Brahmacharya represents the highest level of self-control, an intense mental and spiritual discipline of controlling the senses to attain liberation. It encompasses renouncing desires for temporary worldly pleasures to focus one&#x27;s self toward religious goals.

=== In the Vedas ===
The Vedas discuss , both in the context of lifestyle and as a stage of one&#x27;s life. &quot;Rig Veda&quot;, for example, in Mandala 10, Sukta 136, mentions knowledge seekers as those (long-haired) and with soil-colored clothes (yellow, orange, saffron) engaged in the affairs of (mind, meditation). &quot;Rig Veda&quot;, however, refers to these people as and . The &quot;Atharva Veda&quot;, completed by about , has more explicit discussion of , in Book XI, Chapter 5. This chapter of &quot;Atharva Veda&quot; describes as that which leads to one&#x27;s second birth (mind, Self-awareness), with Hymn 11.5.3 painting a symbolic picture that when a teacher accepts a , the student becomes his embryo.

The concept and practice of is found extensively among the older strata of the Mukhya Upanishads in Hinduism. The text Chandogya Upanishad describes, in Book 8, activities and lifestyle that is :

A hymn in another early Upanishad, the Mundaka Upanishad in Book 3, Chapter 1, similarly states,

The Vedas and early Upanishadic texts of Hinduism in their discussion of , make no mention of the age of the student at the start of , nor any restraint on sexual activity. However, there is a clear general consensus in both specific and various Upanishads (such as the Shandilya Upanishad) as well as Hindu (such as the Manusmriti) that the male &quot;student&quot;, referred to as the &quot;&quot; should abstain from the &quot;release of semen.&quot; This rule may or may not apply to the guru. The verses 11.5.4.16 and 11.5.4.17 of the Satpatha Brahamana present two different viewpoints on the sexual activity, of the guru during the , i.e., the teacher of the &quot;student &quot;, one against and one as a choice. Similarly, in verse 11.5.4.18, the Satapatha Brahmana presents contrasting viewpoints on an eating restraint (regarding honey) for the student.

=== As a virtue ===
 is traditionally regarded as one of the five in Yoga, as declared in verse 2.30 of Patanjali&#x27;s Yoga Sutras. It is a form of self-restraint regarded as a virtue, and an observance recommended in a manner that depends on an individual&#x27;s context. For a married practitioner, it means marital fidelity (not cheating on one&#x27;s spouse); for a single person, it means celibacy. Patanjali in verse 2.38 states that the virtue of brahmacharya leads to the profit of (). This Sanskrit word, , has been variously translated as virility and, by Vyasa, as strength and capacity. Vyasa explains that this virtue promotes other good qualities. 

The Shandilya Upanishad includes as one of ten in Chapter 1, defining it as &quot;refraining from sexual intercourse in all places and in all states in mind, speech, or body&quot; while Linga Purana in chapter 1.8 states that in case of householders, indulgence in sexual intercourse with their own wives and abstention from it with other women mentally, physically and verbally should be understood as brahmacharya as well. 

Other ancient and medieval era texts of Hinduism describe the fruits of this virtue differently. For example, Pada Chandrika, Raja Marttanda, Sutrartha Bodhini, Mani Prabha, and Yoga Sudhakara each state that must be understood as the voluntary restraint of power. Chandogya Upanishad in verses of chapter 8.5 extols as a sacrament and sacrifice which, once perfected, leads to realization of the Self (), and thereafter becomes the habit of experiencing the Self in others and everything. Tattva Vaisharadi and Yoga Sarasangraha assert that leads to an increase in (power of knowledge) and (power of action).

The great epic Mahabharata describes the objective of as knowledge of Brahman (Book Five, Udyoga Parva, the Book of Effort). leads one to union with the Supreme Self (Chapter 43). By subduing desire, the practice of self-restraint enables the student to learn, pay attention in thought, word, and deed to the (teacher), and discover the truth embodied in the Vedas and Upanishads. According to the epic, the practice of studying and learning requires the &quot;aid of time,&quot; as well as personal effort, ability, discussion, and practice, all of which are helped by virtue of . A should do useful work, and the earnings he obtains should be given away as (&quot;fee,&quot; &quot;gift of thanks&quot;) to the guru. The epic declares that is one of twelve virtues, an essential part of in yoga and the path of perfecting perseverance and the pursuit of knowledge.

== In Jainism ==

 is one of the five major vows prescribed for the (layman) and for ascetics in Jainism. For those Jains who adopt the path of monks, celibacy in action, words, and thoughts is expected. For lay Jains who are married, the virtue of requires remaining sexually faithful to one&#x27;s chosen partner. For lay Jains who are unmarried, chaste living requires Jains to avoid sex before marriage. (Supreme Celibacy) is one of the ten excellencies of a Jain monk. is mentioned as one of the (ten virtues) in ancient Jain texts like &quot;Tattvartha Sutra&quot;, &quot;Sarvārthasiddhi&quot; and &quot;Puruşārthasiddhyupāya&quot;.

== Among Sramanic traditions ==
Among the Sramanic traditions (Buddhism, Jainism, Ājīvika, and Charvaka schools), is the term used for a self-imposed practice of celibacy that is generally considered a prerequisite for spiritual practice. The fourth of the five great vows of Jain monks, for example, is the vow of celibacy, which in this case means total abstinence from the sensual pleasure of all five senses, including the avoidance of sexual thoughts and desires. The yogin who is firmly grounded in the virtue of is said to gain great vitality.

== As Asrama stage of life ==
 in Hinduism literally means &quot;conduct consistent with Brahman&quot; or &quot;on the path of Brahman&quot;.

Historically referred to a stage of life () within the Vedic ashram system. Ancient Hindu culture divided the human lifespan into four stages: , , , and . occupies the first 20–25 years of life, roughly corresponding to adolescence. Upon the child&#x27;s , the young person would begin a life of study in the Gurukula (the household of the Guru) dedicated to learning all aspects of that is the &quot;principles of righteous living&quot;. comprised personal responsibilities towards himself, family, society, humanity, and God which included the environment, earth, and nature. This educational period started when the child was five to eight years old and lasted until the age of 14 to 20 years. During this stage of life, the traditional vedic sciences and various are studied along with the religious texts contained within the Vedas and Upanishads. This stage of life was characterized by the practice of celibacy. The purpose of &quot;brahmacharya&quot; in this stage is to get rid of passions, which interfere with learning.

During this stage of life, the chastity is for the purposes of learning from a guru (teacher), and during later stages of life, it is for the purposes of attaining spiritual liberation. (Sanskrit: ).

;Brahmacharya for girls
The Vedas and Upanishads do not restrict the student stage of life to males. &quot;Atharva Veda&quot;, for example, states

;No age restrictions
Gonda states that there were no age restrictions for the start of in ancient India. Not only young men, but older people resorted to the student stage of life, and sought teachers who were authoritative in certain subjects. The &quot;Chandogya Upanishad&quot;, in Section 5.11, describes &quot;wealthy and learned householders&quot; becoming (students) with Rishi Kaikeya, to gain knowledge about Atman (inner Self) and Brahman (Ultimate Reality).

<text>Lindi is a historic coastal town in southern Tanzania and the administrative center of the Lindi Region, the least populated region in the country. Situated at the head of Lindi Bay along the Indian Ocean, the town is located approximately 105 kilometers (65 miles) north of Mtwara, the southernmost coastal town in Tanzania, and about 450 kilometers (280 miles) south of Dar es Salaam, the nation&#x27;s largest city.

The town of Lindi is part of the larger municipality bearing the same name. Notably, Lindi Historic Town is recognized as a national historic site in Tanzania. Additionally, Lindi Airport, located 20 kilometers (12 miles) northeast of the town, providing air connectivity to the region.

==History==
Lindi was founded in the 11th century. There is no record of a previous name of the Swahili town. In the 17th century, the town was renamed by the Omani Arab colonizers as Lindi meaning &quot;deep channel&quot;. The Omanis dominated local people and used the location as a port to sell and transport ivory and slaves to the global market.

With the coming of the German occupation in the 19th century, and later on the British occupation after World War I, the town was the administrative capital of the southern province until 1952 when it was moved to Mtwara City due to its favorable harbor potential in Lindi Bay. In 1971, ten years after independence, the Nyerere administration made Lindi the regional seat for Lindi Region. However, in the following year of 1972, due to a socialist policy, urban councils were abolished in favor of rural development, negatively affecting the economy of the town. However, in 1978, urban councils were reintroduced.

==Economy==
The main economic activities are fishing, salt production, and the farming of coconut, cashew nuts, and roselles.
The 2012 national census reported the town to have a population of 78,841.

== Geography ==

Lindi is located at the mouth of the Lukuledi River. Located on Lindi Bay. Its port facilities are still rudimentary, allowing one or two small cargo and passenger boats at a time, and ocean-going ships cannot be accommodated. The region was once an important area for sisal-producing plantations, especially in Kikwetu, the Lindi airstrip, which lies 25 kilometers north of the town. Around 2012, Lindi was finally linked to Dar es Salaam by a continuous tarmac road, making Lindi accessible throughout the rainy season. An older tarmac road connects Lindi to Mtwara City, passing through Mikindani, an important historic Swahili settlement in Mtwara Region. The Rondo Forest Reserve is an important site of biodiversity which is located at the Rondo Plateau in the southern Lindi Region. Part of a Coastal Forest mosaic, the Rondo Plateau rises sharply from sea level to about and therefore features a unique microclimate.

<doc id="373027" wikidata="Q466449" url="?curid=373027" title="Ashram">
<text>An ashram (, ) is a spiritual hermitage or a monastery in Indian religions.

==Etymology==
The Sanskrit noun is a thematic nominal derivative from the root &#x27;toil&#x27; (&lt; PIE *&quot;ḱremh2&quot;, śramaṇa) with the prefix &#x27;towards.&#x27; An ashram is a place where one strives towards a goal in a disciplined manner. Such a goal could be ascetic, spiritual, yogic or any other.

==Overview==

An ashram would traditionally, but not necessarily in contemporary times, be located far from human habitation, in forests or mountainous regions, amidst refreshing natural surroundings conducive to spiritual instruction and meditation. The residents of an ashram regularly performed spiritual and physical exercises, such as the various forms of yoga. Other sacrifices and penances, such as yajnas, were also performed. Many ashrams also served as gurukulas, residential schools for children under the guru-shishya tradition.

Sometimes, the goal of a pilgrimage to the ashram was not tranquility, but instruction in some art, especially warfare. In the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, the princes of ancient Ayodhya, Rama, and Lakshmana, go to Vishvamitra&#x27;s ashram to protect his yajnas from being defiled by emissary-demons of Ravana. After they prove their mettle, the princes receive martial instruction from the sage, especially in the use of divine weapons. In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, Krishna, in his youth, goes to the ashram of Sandipani to gain knowledge of both intellectual and spiritual matters.

==Schools in Maharashtra==
Boarding schools, especially in the tribal areas of Maharashtra and elsewhere in India, are called &quot;ashram shala&quot; or ashram schools. One such school is the Lok Biradari Prakalp Ashram Shala.

==In the West==
A number of ashrams have been established outside India. Typically, these ashrams are connected to Indian lineages, focus on imparting Yoga-related teachings, often in residential retreats, and are headed by spiritual teachers (Indians or Western).

<text>Vānaprastha () literally meaning &#x27;way of the forest&#x27; or &#x27;forest road&#x27;, is the third stage in the &#x27;Chaturasrama&#x27; system of Hinduism. It represents the third of the four &quot;ashramas&quot; (stages) of human life, the other three being Brahmacharya (bachelor student, 1st stage), Grihastha (married householder, 2nd stage) and Sannyasa (renunciation ascetic, 4th stage).

&quot;Vānaprastha&quot; is part of the Vedic ashrama system, which starts when a person hands over household responsibilities to the next generation, takes an advisory role, and gradually withdraws from the world. This stage typically follows &quot;Grihastha&quot; (householder), but a man or woman may choose to skip householder stage, and enter &quot;Vānaprastha&quot; directly after Brahmacharya (student) stage, as a prelude to Sannyasa (ascetic) and spiritual pursuits.

Vānaprastha stage is considered as a transition phase from a householder&#x27;s life with greater emphasis on Artha and Kama (pursuits related to wealth and pleasures) to one with greater emphasis on Moksha (spiritual liberation).

==Etymology==

&quot;Vānaprastha&quot; (वानप्रस्थ) is a composite word with the roots &quot;vana&quot; (वन) meaning &quot;forest, distant land&quot;, and &quot;prastha&quot; (प्रस्थ) meaning &quot;going to, abiding in, journey to&quot;. The composite word literally means &quot;retiring to forest&quot;.

Widgery states that &quot;Vānaprastha&quot; is synonymous with Aranyaka (Sanskrit: आरण्यक) in historic Indian literature discussing four stages of human life.

==Discussion==
&quot;Vānaprastha&quot; is part of the ancient Indian concept called Chaturashrama, which identified four stages of a human life, with distinct differences based on natural human needs and drives. The first stage of life was Brahmacharya (bachelor student) lasting through about 25 years of life, the second stage was Grihastha (married householder) and lasted through about 50 year age. Vānaprastha represented the third stage and typically marked with birth of grandchildren, gradual transition of householder responsibilities to the next generation, increasingly hermit-like lifestyle, and greater emphasis on community services and spiritual pursuit. The Vānaprastha stage ultimately transitioned into Sannyasa, a stage of complete renunciation and dedication to spiritual questions.

Vānaprastha, according to Vedic ashrama system, lasted between the ages of 50 and 74.

Nugteren states that &quot;Vānaprastha&quot; was, in practice, a metaphor and guideline. It encouraged gradual transition of social responsibility, economic roles, personal focus towards spirituality, from being center of the action to a more advisory peripheral role, without actually requiring someone to actually moving into a forest with or without one&#x27;s partner. While some literally gave up their property and possessions to move into distant lands, most stayed with their families and communities but assumed a transitioning role and gracefully accept an evolving role with age. Dhavamony identifies Vānaprastha stage as one of &quot;detachment and increasing seclusion&quot; but usually serving as a counselor, peace-maker, judge, teacher to young and advisor to the middle-aged.

While &quot;Grihastha&quot; and &quot;Vānaprastha&quot; stages of life were recommended, they were not a requirement. Any &quot;Brahmacharya&quot; may, if he or she wants, skip householder and retirement stage, go straight to Sannyasa stage of life, thereby renouncing worldly and materialistic pursuits and dedicating their lives to spiritual pursuits.

==Literature==
;History
Jamison and Witzel state early Vedic texts make no mention of life in retirement, or &quot;Vānaprastha&quot;, or &quot;Ashrama system&quot;, unlike the concepts of Brahmacharin and Grihasthi which can be distinguished. The earliest mention of a related concept in Rig Veda is of &quot;Antigriha&quot; (अन्तिगृह, like a neighbor) in hymn 10.95.4, where the context and content suggests the elders did not go into forest, but continued to live as part of extended family, with outwardly role, in ancient India. In later Vedic era and over time, &quot;Vānaprastha&quot; and other new concepts emerged, while older ideas evolved and expanded. The concept of &quot;Vānaprastha&quot;, and Sannyasa, emerged about or after 7th century BCE, when sages such as Yājñavalkya left their homes and roamed around as spiritual recluses and pursued their &quot;Pravrajika&quot; (homeless) lifestyle.

The Dharmasūtras and Dharmaśāstras, composed about mid 1st millennium BCE and later, place increasing emphasis on all four stages of &quot;Ashrama system&quot;, including &quot;Vānaprastha&quot;. The Baudhayana Dharmasūtra, in verses 2.11.9 to 2.11.12, describes the four Ashramas including &quot;Vānaprastha&quot; as &quot;a fourfold division of Dharma&quot;. The older Dharmasūtras, however, are significantly different in their treatment of &quot;Ashramas&quot; system from the more modern Dharmaśāstras, because they do not limit some of their Ashrama rituals to the three &quot;varnas&quot; – Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas. The newer Dharmaśāstra vary widely in their discussion of &quot;Ashrama&quot; system including &quot;Vānaprastha&quot; in the context of classes (castes), with some mentioning it for three, while others such as &quot;Vaikhānasa Dharmasūtra&quot; including all four.

Olivelle posits that the older Dharmasūtras present the &quot;Ashramas&quot; as four alternative ways of life and options available, but not as sequential stage that any individual must follow. Olivelle also states that &quot;Vānaprastha&quot; along with the Ashrama system gained mainstream scholarly acceptance about 2nd century BCE.

;Spectrum of views
Numerous ancient and medieval texts of India discuss the four stages of a human being. Each offers different perspective. Some are strict and literal, while others discuss the concept in contextual and metaphorical terms. For example, Manusmriti offers elaborate prescriptions for drastic kind of renunciation, describing in verse 6.21 what the retiree in the forest should eat. In contrast, the Mahabharata suggests Vānaprastha is a symbolic metaphor and declares that a king may achieve the &quot;object of Vānaprastha&quot; by certain actions, without retiring into the forest. For example, Shanti Parva (the Book of Peace) of the Hindu Epic, states,

Markandeya Purana suggests that a householder, after he has taken care of his progeny, his parents, his traditions and cleansed his mind is ready to enter the third stage of life, or Vānaprastha. He must lead a frugal life during this stage, sleeping on floor, eating only fruits and bulbs. The more he gives up the worldly delights, the closer he gets to the knowledge of his spirit, and more ready he is for the last stage – the Sannyasa asrama, where he renounces everything and focuses entirely on spiritual pursuits.

&quot;Vānaprastha&quot; appears in many major literary works from ancient India. For example, many chapters of the Hindu Epic Ramayana, just like the Mahabharata, build around hermit-style life in a forest (Vānaprastha). Similarly, the Abhijñānaśākuntalam (Shakuntala play by Kalidasa) revolves around hermit lifestyle in a forest. Many of the legendary forest hermitages, mentioned in various Sanskrit works, later became sites for major temples and Hindu pilgrimage.

Narada Parivrajaka Upanishad identifies four characteristics of a &quot;Vānaprastha&quot; stage of life as &quot;Audumbara&quot; (threshold of house, woods), &quot;Vaikhanasa&quot; (anchorite), &quot;Samprakshali&quot; (cleansing rituals) and &quot;Purnamanasa&quot; (contented mind).

Nigal states Vānaprastha stage to be a gradual evolution of a &quot;family man&quot; to a &quot;society man&quot;, from one seeking &quot;personal gain&quot; to one seeking a &quot;better world, welfare of his community, agapistic altruism&quot;.

<text>The rock sparrow or rock petronia (Petronia petronia) is a small passerine bird in the sparrow family Passeridae. It is the only member of the genus &quot;Petronia&quot;. It breeds on barren rocky hills from the Iberian Peninsula and western north Africa across southern Europe and through the Palearctic Siberia and north and central China. It is largely resident in the west of its range, but Asian birds migrate to more southerly areas, or move down the mountains.

==Taxonomy==
The first formal description of the rock sparrow was by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1766 in the twelfth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He introduced the binomial name &quot;Fringilla petronia&quot;. It is now the only species in the genus &quot;Petronia&quot; that was introduced by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1829. &quot;Petronia&quot; is a local name for the rock sparrow from the Bologna area of Italy.

Seven subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;P. p. petronia&quot; (Linnaeus, 1766) – Madeira and Canary Islands, south Europe to west Turkey
* &quot;P. p. barbara&quot; Erlanger, 1899 – northwest Africa
* &quot;P. p. puteicola&quot; Festa, 1894 – south Turkey to Jordan
* &quot;P. p. exigua&quot; (Hellmayr, 1902) – central Turkey to the Caucasus, north Iran and north Iraq
* &quot;P. p. kirhizica&quot; Sushkin, 1925 – Caspian Sea to Kyrgyzstan
* &quot;P. p. intermedia&quot; Hartert, 1901 – Iran and north Afghanistan to northwest China
* &quot;P. p. brevirostris&quot; Taczanowski, 1874 – Mongolia, south central Siberia and north and central China

Some species have once been classified under Petronia, specifically from the related genus Gymnoris (&quot;Petronia superciliaris, Petronia dentata, Petronia xanthocollis&quot;) and Carpospiza (&quot;Petronia brachydactyla&quot;).

==Description==
The rock sparrow is similar in size to a house sparrow but with a larger more conical bill. It is around in length, with a strong whitish supercilium and weaker crown stripe. It has a patterned brown back and wings, streaked underparts, and a diagnostic, but hard-to-see, yellow throat spot. &quot;Petronia petronia&quot; are monochromatic, with a distinctive yellow patch on their upper breast that starkly contrasts the earth tones of their plumage. This carotenoid-based trait is present in both sexes, and plays an important role during the breeding season, signalling both attractiveness and social status. This bird has a loud wheezy song.

==Distribution and habitat==
It is a rare vagrant north of its breeding range. There is just a single record from Great Britain, at Cley, Norfolk on 14 June 1981. This gregarious bird is also found in human settlements in suitable country.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
It nests in crevices in rocks or walls, laying four to five eggs. Rock sparrows exhibit a variety of mating patterns, most notably monogamy and sequential and simultaneous polyandry; however, social monogamy is the most abundant mating pattern. The frequencies of these various mating patterns most likely vary with numerous ecological and social factors. Many studies have shown that both males and females prefer a mate with a larger yellow patch. It has also been shown that male brood defence behaviours increase with greater female ornamentation. Males also differentially allocate parental investment according to female ornamentation; this behaviour is not observed in females. In alpine colonies of &quot;Petronia petronia&quot;, females perform most of the provisioning. In Asian colonies, both males and females contribute equally to the care of the young. Males of larger sizes feed their young at higher rates, which suggests that larger males occupy better territories and/or are better fathers. Studies have found a positive correlation between male yellow breast patch size and nestling tarsus length, which suggests that more ornamented males are also better parents. Females increase the number of non-feeding visits to their nest as the season progresses, suggesting that because females have lesser opportunities to lay other clutches, it is most advantageous to support the survival of their current offspring. A positive relationship between the number of deserting females and the number of available males has been recorded.

===Food and feeding===
The rock sparrow mainly forages on the ground. It eats seeds throughout the year and berries in autumn. In the spring its diet includes invertebrates, particularly caterpillars and grasshoppers. These are also fed to the young.

<text>Kamadhenu (, , ), also known as Surabhi (, or , ), is a divine bovine-goddess described in Hinduism as the mother of all cows. She is a miraculous cow of plenty who provides her owner whatever they desire and is often portrayed as the mother of other cattle. In iconography, she is generally depicted as a white cow with a female head and breasts, the wings of a bird, and the tail of a peafowl or as a white cow containing various deities within her body. Kamadhenu is not worshipped independently as a goddess. Rather, she is honored by the Hindu veneration of cows, who are regarded as her earthly embodiments.

Hindu scriptures provide diverse accounts of the birth of Kamadhenu. While some narrate that she emerged from the churning of the cosmic ocean, others describe her as the daughter of the creator god Daksha, and as the wife of the sage Kashyapa. Still other scriptures narrate that Kamadhenu was in the possession of either Jamadagni or Vashista (both ancient sages), and that kings who tried to steal her from the sage ultimately faced dire consequences for their actions. Kamadhenu plays the important role of providing milk and milk products to be used in her sage-master&#x27;s oblations; she is also capable of producing fierce warriors to protect him. In addition to dwelling in the sage&#x27;s hermitage, she is also described as dwelling in Goloka—the realm of the cows—and Patala, the netherworld.

==Etymology==
Kamadhenu is often addressed by the proper name &quot;Surabhi&quot; or &quot;Shurbhi&quot;, which is also used as a synonym for an ordinary cow. Professor Jacobi considers the name Surabhi—&quot;the fragrant one&quot;—to have originated from the peculiar smell of cows. According to the Monier Williams Sanskrit–English Dictionary (1899), Surabhi means fragrant, charming, pleasing, as well as cow and earth. It can specifically refer to the divine cow Kamadhenu, the mother of cattle who is also sometimes described as a &quot;Matrika&quot; (&quot;mother&quot;) goddess. Other proper names attributed to Kamadhenu are &quot;Sabala&quot; (&quot;the spotted one&quot;) and &quot;Kapila&quot; (&quot;the red one&quot;).

The epithets &quot;Kamadhenu&quot; (), &quot;Kamaduh&quot; () and &quot;Kamaduha&quot; () literally mean the cow &quot;from whom all that is desired is drawn&quot;—&quot;the cow of plenty&quot;. In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and &quot;Devi Bhagavata Purana&quot;, in the context of the birth of Bhishma, the cow Nandini is given the epithet Kamadhenu. In other instances, Nandini is described as the cow-daughter of Surabhi-Kamadhenu. The scholar Vettam Mani considers Nandini and Surabhi to be synonyms of Kamadhenu.

==Iconography and symbolism==
According to Indologist Madeleine Biardeau, Kamadhenu or Kamaduh is the generic name of the sacred cow, who is regarded as the source of all prosperity in Hinduism. Kamadhenu is regarded as a form of Devi (the Hindu Divine Mother) and is closely related to the fertile Mother Earth (Prithvi), who is often described as a cow in Sanskrit. The sacred cow denotes &quot;purity and non-erotic fertility, ... sacrificing and motherly nature, [and] sustenance of human life&quot;.

Frederick M. Smith describes Kamadhenu as a &quot;popular and enduring image in Indian art&quot;. All the gods are believed to reside in the body of Kamadhenu—the generic cow. Her four legs are the scriptural Vedas; her horns are the triune gods Brahma (tip), Vishnu (middle) and Shiva (base); her eyes are the sun and moon gods, her shoulders the fire-god Agni and the wind-god Vayu and her legs the Himalayas. Kamadhenu is often depicted in this form in poster art.

Another representation of Kamadhenu shows her with the body of a white Zebu cow, crowned woman&#x27;s head, colourful eagle wings and a peacock&#x27;s tail. According to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, this form is influenced by the iconography of the Islamic Buraq, who is portrayed with a horse&#x27;s body, wings, and a woman&#x27;s face. Contemporary poster art also portrays Kamadhenu in this form.

A cow, identified with Kamadhenu, is often depicted accompanying the god Dattatreya. In relation to the deity&#x27;s iconography, she denotes the Brahminical aspect and Vaishnava connection of the deity contrasting with the accompanying dogs—symbolizing a non-Brahminical aspect. She also symbolizes the &quot;Panch Bhuta&quot; (the five classical elements) in the icon. Dattatreya is sometimes depicted holding the divine cow in one of his hands.

==Birth and children==
The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; (Adi Parva) records that Kamadhenu-Surabhi rose from the churning of the cosmic ocean (&quot;Samudra Manthana&quot;) by the gods and demons to acquire &quot;amrita&quot; (ambrosia, elixir of life). As such, she is regarded the offspring of the gods and demons, created when they churned the cosmic milk ocean and then given to the Saptarishi, the seven great seers. She was ordered by the creator-god Brahma to give milk, and supply it and &quot;ghee&quot; (&quot;clarified butter&quot;) for ritual fire-sacrifices.

The &quot;Anushasana Parva&quot; book of the epic narrates that Surabhi was born from the belch of &quot;the creator&quot; (&quot;Prajapati&quot;) Daksha after he drank the &quot;amrita&quot; that rose from the Samudra Manthana. Further, Surabhi gave birth to many golden cows called &quot;Kapila cows&quot;, who were called the mothers of the world. The &quot;Satapatha Brahmana&quot; also tells a similar tale: &quot;Prajapati&quot; created Surabhi from his breath. The &quot;Udyoga Parva&quot; book of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; narrates that the creator-god Brahma drank so much &quot;amrita&quot; that he vomited some of it, from which emerged Surabhi.

According to the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, Surabhi is the daughter of Sage Kashyapa and his wife Krodhavasha, a daughter of Daksha. Her daughters Rohini and Gandharvi are the mothers of cattle and horses respectively. Still, it is Surabhi who is described as the mother of all cows in the text. However, in the &quot;Puranas&quot;, such as &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; and &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot;, Surabhi is described as the daughter of Daksha and the wife of Kashyapa, as well as the mother of cows and buffaloes.

The &quot;Matsya Purana&quot; notes two conflicting descriptions of Surabhi. In one chapter, it describes Surabhi as the consort of Brahma and their union produced the cow Yogishvari, She is then described as the mother of cows and quadrupeds. In another instance, she is described as a daughter of Daksha, wife of Kashyapa and the mother of cows. The &quot;Harivamsa&quot;, an appendix of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, calls Surabhi the mother of amrita, Brahmins, cows, and the Rudras.

The &quot;Devi Bhagavata Purana&quot; narrates that Krishna and his lover Radha were enjoying dalliance, when they thirsted for milk. So, Krishna created a cow called Surabhi and a calf called Manoratha from the left side of his body, and milked the cow. When drinking the milk, the milk pot fell on the ground and broke, spilling the milk, which became the Kshira Sagara, the cosmic milk ocean. Numerous cows then emerged from the pores of Surabhi&#x27;s skin and were presented to the cowherd-companions (gopas) of Krishna by him. Then Krishna worshipped Surabhi and decreed that she—a cow, the giver of milk and prosperity—be worshipped at Diwali on Bali Pratipada day.

Various other scriptural references describe Surabhi as the mother of the Rudras including Nirrti (Kashyapa being the father), the cow Nandini and even the serpent-people nāgas. The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; also makes a passing reference to Surabhi as the mother of Nandini (literally &quot;daughter&quot;) in the context of the birth of Bhishma, an incarnation of a Vasu. Nandini, like her mother, is a &quot;cow of plenty&quot; or &quot;Kamadhenu&quot;, and resides with sage Vashistha. Nandini is stolen by the divine Vasus and thus cursed by the sage to be born on the earth. The &quot;Raghuvamsa&quot; of Kalidasa mentions that the king Dilipa—an ancestor of god Rama—once passed by Kamadhenu-Surabhi, but failed to pay respects to her, thus incurring the wrath of the divine cow, who cursed the king to be rendered childless. Since Kamadhenu had gone to Patala, the guru of Dilipa, Vasishtha advised the king to serve Nandini, Kamadhenu&#x27;s daughter, who was in the hermitage. The king and his wife propitiated Nandini, who neutralized her mother&#x27;s curse and blessed the king to have a son, who was named Raghu.

In the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, Surabhi is described to be distressed by the treatment of her sons—the oxen—in fields. Her tears are considered a bad omen for the gods by Indra, the god-king of heaven. The &quot;Vana Parva&quot; book of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; also narrates a similar instance: Surabhi cries about the plight of her son—a bullock, who is overworked and beaten by his peasant-master. Indra, moved by Surabhi&#x27;s tears, rains to stop the ploughing of the tormented bullock.

==Wealth and protector of the Brahmins==
Kamadhenu is often associated with the Brahmins (the priesthood class, especially sages), whose wealth she symbolises. Cow&#x27;s milk and its derivatives such as ghee (clarified butter) are integral parts of Vedic fire sacrifices, which are conducted by Brahmin priests; thus she is sometimes also referred to as &quot;Homadhenu&quot;—the cow from whom oblations are drawn. Moreover, the cow also offers the Brahmins—who are prohibited to fight—protection against abusive kings who try to harm them. As a goddess, she becomes a warrior, creating armies to protect her master and herself.

===Jamadagni&#x27;s cow===
A legend narrates that the sacred cow Kamadhenu resided with sage Jamadagni. The earliest version of the legend, which appears in the epic Mahabharata, narrates that the thousand-armed &quot;Haihaya&quot; king, Kartavirya Arjuna, destroyed Jamadagni&#x27;s hermitage and captured the calf of Kamadhenu. To retrieve the calf, Jamadagni&#x27;s son Parashurama slew the king, whose sons in turn killed Jamadagni. Parashurama then destroyed the &quot;kshatriya&quot; (&quot;warrior&quot;) race 21 times and his father is resurrected by divine grace. Similar accounts of the abduction of the celestial cow or her calf, the killing of Jamadagni by Kartavirya Arjuna, and the revenge of Parashurama resulting in the death of Kartavirya Arjuna, exist in other texts. The &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; mentions that the king abducted Kamadhenu as well as her calf and Parashurama defeated the king and returned the kine to his father. The &quot;Padma Purana&quot; mentions that when Kartavirya Arjuna tried to capture her, Kamadhenu, by her own power, defeated him and his army and flew off to heaven; the enraged king then killed Jamadagni.

In the &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot;, Kamadhenu creates a great city by her power to accommodate Kartavirya Arjuna&#x27;s army, when they visit Jamadagni&#x27;s hermitage. On returning to his kingdom, Kartavirya Arjuna&#x27;s minister, Chandragupta, persuades him to capture the divine cow. The minister returns to the hermitage and tries to convince the sage to give away the cow, but to no avail, so he tries to snatch Kamadhenu with force. In the ensuing fight, the sage is killed, but Kamadhenu escapes to the sky and Chandragupta takes her calf with him instead. The Brahmanda Purana narrates this Kamadhenu Sushila was given to Jamadagni by the Kamadhenu-Surabhi, who governs in Goloka.

The &quot;Brahma Vaivarta Purana&quot; narrates that the celestial cow – called Kapila here – produces various weapons and an army to aid Jamadagni defeat the king&#x27;s army, who had come to seize her. When the king himself challenged Jamadagni for battle, Kapila instructed her master in martial arts. Jamadagni led the army created by Kapila and defeated the king and his army several times; each time sparing the life of the king. Finally, with the aid of a divine spear granted to him by the god Dattatreya, the king killed Jamadagni.

===Vasishtha&#x27;s cow===

The &quot;Ramayana&quot; presents a similar account about Kamadhenu, however, here the sage is Vasishtha and the king is Vishvamitra. Once, king Vishvamitra with his army arrived at the hermitage of the sage Vasishtha. The sage welcomed him and offered a huge banquet – to the army – that was produced by Sabala – as Kamadhenu is called in the text. The astonished king asked the sage to part with Sabala and instead offered thousand of ordinary cows, elephants, horses and jewels in return. However, the sage refused to part with Sabala, who was necessary for the performance of the sacred rituals and charity by the sage. Agitated, Vishvamitra seized Sabala by force, but she returned to her master, fighting the king&#x27;s men. She hinted Vasishtha to order her to destroy the king&#x27;s army and the sage followed her wish. Intensely, she produced Pahlava warriors, who were slain by Vishvamitra&#x27;s army. So she produced warriors of Shaka-Yavana lineage. From her mouth emerged the Kambojas, from her udder Barvaras, from her hind Yavanas and Shakas, and from pores on her skin, Haritas, Kiratas and other foreign warriors. Together, the army of Sabala killed Vishvamitra&#x27;s army and all his sons. This event led to a great rivalry between Vasishtha and Vishvamitra, who renounced his kingdom and became a great sage to defeat Vasishtha.

==Abodes==
Kamadhenu-Surabhi&#x27;s residence varies depending on different scriptures. The &quot;Anushasana Parva&quot; of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; tells how she was given the ownership of Goloka, the cow-heaven located above the three worlds (heaven, earth and netherworld): the daughter of Daksha, Surabhi went to Mount Kailash and worshipped Brahma for 10,000 years. The pleased god conferred goddess-hood on the cow and decreed that all people would worship her and her children – cows. He also gave her a world called Goloka, while her daughters would reside on earth among humans.

In one instance in the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, Surabhi is described to live in the city of Varuna – the lord of the oceans – which is situated below the earth in Patala (the netherworld). Her flowing sweet milk is said to form &quot;Kshiroda&quot; or the Kshira Sagara, the cosmic milk ocean. In the &quot;Udyoga Parva&quot; book of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, this milk is said to be of six flavours and has the essence of all the best things of the earth. The &quot;Udyoga Parva&quot; specifies that Surabhi inhabits the lowest realm of Patala, known as Rasatala, and has four daughters – the &quot;Dikpali&quot;s – the guardian cow goddesses of the heavenly quarters: Saurabhi in the east, Harhsika in the south, Subhadra in the west, and Dhenu in the north.

Apart from Goloka and Patala, Kamadhenu is also described as residing in the hermitages of the sages Jamadagni and Vasishtha. The scholar Mani explains the contradicting stories of Kamadhenu&#x27;s birth and presence in the processions of many gods and sages by stating that while there could be more than one Kamadhenu, all of them are incarnations of the original Kamadhenu, the mother of cows.

The &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot;, a discourse by the god Krishna in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, twice refers to Kamadhenu as &quot;Kamaduh&quot;. In verse 3.10, Krishna makes a reference to Kamaduh while conveying that for doing one&#x27;s duty, one would get the milk of one&#x27;s desires. In verse 10.28, when Krishna declares to the source of the universe, he proclaims that among cows, he is Kamaduh.

In the &quot;Anushasana Parva&quot; of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the god Shiva is described to have cast a curse on Surabhi. This curse is interpreted as a reference to the following legend: Once, when the gods Brahma and Vishnu disputed over each other&#x27;s superiority, a massive, fiery pillar of light— the lingam (symbol of Shiva)—emerged before them. The decided that whoever among them was able to discover the end of this pillar would be deemed superior. Brahma flew towards the skies to try to find the northern end of the pillar, but failed. So, Brahma forced Surabhi (in some versions, Surabhi instead suggested that Brahma should lie) to falsely testify to Vishnu that Brahma had seen the top of the lingam; Shiva punished Surabhi for her dishonesty by declaring hat her bovine offspring would consume unholy substances. This tale appears in the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot;.

==Worship==
Some temples and houses have images of Kamadhenu, which are worshipped. However, she has never had a worship cult dedicated to her and does not have any temples where she is worshipped as the chief deity. A recent temple called Kamadhenu Devi Temple, KR Puram, Bangalore is dedicated to her. In Monier-Williams&#x27;s words: &quot;It is rather the living animal [the cow] which is the perpetual object of adoration&quot;. Cows are often fed outside temples and worshipped regularly on all Fridays and on special occasions. Every cow to &quot;a pious Hindu&quot; is regarded as an avatar (earthly embodiment) of the divine Kamadhenu.

<doc id="373047" wikidata="Q831377" url="?curid=373047" title="Bethlem Royal Hospital">
<text>Bethlem Royal Hospital, also known as St Mary Bethlehem, Bethlehem Hospital and Bedlam, is a psychiatric hospital in Bromley, London. Its famous history has inspired several horror books, films, and TV series, most notably &quot;Bedlam&quot;, a 1946 film with Boris Karloff.

The hospital is part of the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. It is closely associated with King&#x27;s College London and, in partnership with the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, is a major centre for psychiatric research. It is part of the King&#x27;s Health Partners academic health science centre and the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health.

Founded in 1247, the hospital was originally located just outside the city walls, in the Bishopsgate Without area of the City of London. It moved a short distance to Moorfields in 1676, and then to St George&#x27;s Fields in Southwark in 1815, before moving to its current location in Monks Orchard in 1930.

The word &quot;&quot;, meaning uproar and confusion, is derived from the hospital&#x27;s nickname. Although it became a modern psychiatric hospital, historically it was representative of the worst excesses of asylums in the era of lunacy reform.

==1247–1633==

===Foundation===

The hospital was founded in 1247 as the Priory of the New Order of our Lady of Bethlehem in the city of London during the reign of Henry III.

It was established by the Bishop-elect of Bethlehem, the Italian Goffredo de Prefetti, following a donation of personal property by the London alderman and former sheriff, Simon FitzMary. The original location was just beyond London&#x27;s wall, in the parish of St Botolph-without-Bishopsgate, which for civil purposes was coterminous with the Bishopsgate Without area. The hospital was located where the south-east corner of Liverpool Street Station now stands. Bethlem was not initially intended as a hospital, in the clinical sense, much less as a specialist institution for the insane, but as a centre for the collection of alms to support the Crusader Church and to link England to the Holy Land.

De Prefetti&#x27;s need to generate income for the Crusader Church and restore the financial fortunes of his see had been occasioned by two misfortunes: his bishopric had suffered significant losses following the destructive conquest of Bethlehem by the Khwarazmian Turks in 1244, and his immediate predecessor had further impoverished his cathedral chapter through the alienation of a considerable amount of its property. The priory, obedient to the Church of Bethlehem, also housed the poor and, if they visited, provided hospitality to the bishop, canons, and brothers of Bethlehem. Thus, Bethlem became a &quot;hospital&quot;, in medieval usage, &quot;an institution supported by charity or taxes for the care of the needy&quot;. The subordination of the priory&#x27;s religious order to the bishops of Bethlehem was further underlined in the foundational charter, which stipulated that the prior, canons, and inmates were to wear a star upon their cloaks and capes to symbolise their obedience to the church of Bethlehem.

===Politics and patronage===
During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, with its activities underwritten by episcopal and papal indulgences, the hospital&#x27;s role as a centre for alms collection persisted, but its linkage to the Order of Bethlehem increasingly unravelled, putting its purpose and patronage in doubt. In 1346, the master of Bethlem, a position at that time granted to the most senior of London&#x27;s Bethlemite brethren, applied to the city authorities seeking protection; thereafter metropolitan office-holders claimed power to oversee the appointment of masters and demanded in return an annual payment of 40 shillings. It is doubtful whether the city really provided substantial protection and much less that the mastership fell within their patronage but, dating from the 1346 petition, it played a role in the management of Bethlem&#x27;s finances. By this time, the Bethlehemite bishops had relocated to Clamecy, France, under the surety of the Avignon papacy. This was significant as, throughout the reign of Edward III (1327–77), the English monarchy had extended its patronage over ecclesiastical positions through the seizure of priories under the control of non-English religious houses. As a dependent house of the Order of Saint Bethlehem in Clamecy, Bethlem was vulnerable to seizure by the crown and this occurred in the 1370s when Edward III took control. The purpose of this appropriation was, in the context of the Hundred Years&#x27; War between France and England, to prevent funds raised by the hospital from enriching the French monarchy via the papal court. After this event the masters of the hospital, semi-autonomous figures in charge of its day-to-day management, were normally crown appointees and it became an increasingly secularised institution. The memory of its foundation became muddied and muddled; in 1381, the royal candidate for the post of master claimed that from its beginnings it had been superintended by an order of knights and he confused its founder, Goffredo de Prefetti, with the Frankish crusader, Godfrey de Bouillon. The removal of the last symbolic link to the Bethlehemites was confirmed in 1403 when it was reported that master and inmates no longer wore the star of Bethlehem.
In 1546, the Lord Mayor of London, Sir John Gresham, petitioned the crown to grant Bethlem to the city. This petition was partially successful and Henry VIII reluctantly ceded to the City of London &quot;the custody, order and governance&quot; of the hospital and of its &quot;occupants and revenues&quot;. This charter came into effect in 1547. The crown retained possession of the hospital while its administration fell to the city authorities. Following a brief interval when it was placed under the management of the governors of Christ&#x27;s Hospital, from 1557 it was administered by the governors of Bridewell, a prototype house of correction at Blackfriars. Having been thus one of the few metropolitan hospitals to have survived the dissolution of the monasteries physically intact, this joint administration continued, not without interference by both the crown and city, until incorporation into the National Health Service in 1948.

===From Bethlem to Bedlam===
It is unknown when Bethlem, or Bedlam, began to specialise in the care and control of the insane, but it has been frequently asserted that Bethlem was first used for the insane from 1377. This date is derived from the unsubstantiated conjecture of the Reverend Edward Geoffrey O&#x27;Donoghue, chaplain to the hospital, who published a monograph on its history in 1914. While it is possible that Bethlem was receiving the insane during the late fourteenth century, the first definitive record of their presence in the hospital is in the details of a visitation of the Charity Commissioners in 1403. This recorded that amongst other patients there were six male inmates who were &quot;mente capti&quot;, a Latin term indicating insanity. The report of the visitation also noted the presence of four pairs of manacles, 11 chains, six locks and two pairs of stocks but it is not clear if any or all of these items were for the restraint of the inmates. While mechanical restraint and solitary confinement are likely to have been used for those regarded as dangerous, little else is known of the actual treatment of the insane for much of the medieval period. The presence of a small number of insane patients in 1403 marks Bethlem&#x27;s gradual transition from a diminutive general hospital into a specialist institution for the confinement of the insane. This process was largely completed by 1460.
From the fourteenth century, Bethlem had been referred to colloquially as &quot;Bedleheem&quot;, &quot;Bedleem&quot; or &quot;Bedlam&quot;. Initially &quot;Bedlam&quot; was an informal name but from approximately the Jacobean era the word entered everyday speech to signify a state of madness, chaos, and the irrational nature of the world. This development was partly due to Bedlam&#x27;s staging in several plays of the Jacobean and Caroline periods, including &quot;The Honest Whore, Part I&quot; (1604); &quot;Northward Ho&quot; (1607); &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot; (1612); &quot;The Pilgrim&quot; (); and &quot;The Changeling&quot; (1622). This dramatic interest in Bedlam is also evident in references to it in early seventeenth-century plays such as &quot;Epicœne, or The Silent Woman&quot; (1609), &quot;Bartholomew Fair&quot; (1614), and &quot;A New Way to Pay Old Debts&quot; (). The appropriation of Bedlam as a theatrical locale for the depiction of madness probably owes no little debt to the establishment in 1576 in nearby Moorfields of The Curtain and The Theatre, two of the main London playhouses; it may also have been coincident with that other theatricalisation of madness as charitable object, the commencement of public visiting at Bethlem.

===Management===

The position of master was a sinecure largely regarded by its occupants as means of profiting at the expense of the poor in their charge. The appointment of the masters, later known as keepers, had lain within the patronage of the Crown until 1547. Thereafter the City, through the Court of Aldermen, took control and, as with the king&#x27;s appointees, the office was used to reward loyal servants and friends. Compared to the masters placed by the monarch, those who gained the position through the city were of much more modest status. In 1561, the Lord Mayor succeeded in having his former porter, Richard Munnes, a draper by trade, appointed to the position. The sole qualification of his successor in 1565, a man by the name of Edward Rest, appears to have been his occupation as a grocer. Rest died in 1571, at which point the keepership passed on to John Mell in 1576, known for his abuse of &quot;the governors, those who gave money to the poor, and the poor themselves.&quot; The Bridewell Governors largely interpreted the role of keeper as that of a house manager and this is clearly reflected in the occupations of most appointees as they tended to be inn-keepers, victualers, or brewers, and the like. When patients were sent to Bethlem by the Governors of the Bridewell the keeper was paid from hospital funds. For the remainder, keepers were paid either by the families and friends of inmates or by the parish authorities. It is possible that keepers negotiated their fees for these latter categories of patients.

John Mell&#x27;s death in 1579 left the keepership open for the long-term keeper Roland Sleford, a London cloth-maker, who left his post in 1598, apparently of his own volition, after a 19-year tenure. Two months later, the Bridewell Governors, who had until then shown little interest in the management of Bethlem beyond the appointment of keepers, conducted an inspection of the hospital and a census of its inhabitants for the first time in over 40 years. Their purpose was &quot;to view and p[er]use the defaultes and want of rep[ar]ac[i]ons&quot;. They found that during the period of Sleford&#x27;s keepership the hospital buildings had fallen into a deplorable condition with the roof caving in and the kitchen sink blocked, and reported that &quot;...it is not fitt for anye man to dwell in wch was left by the Keeper for that it is so loathsomly filthely kept not fit for any man to come into the house&quot;.

The committee of inspection found 21 inmates with only two having been admitted during the previous 12 months. Of the remainder, at least six had been resident for a minimum of eight years and one inmate had been there for around 25 years. Three were from outside London, six were charitable cases paid for out of the hospital&#x27;s resources, one was supported by a parochial authority, and the rest were provided for by family, friends, benefactors or, in one instance, out of their own funds. The reason for the Governors&#x27; new-found interest in Bethlem is unknown but it may have been connected to the increased scrutiny the hospital was coming under with the passing of poor law legislation in 1598 and to the decision by the Governors to increase hospital revenues by opening it up to general visitors as a spectacle. After this inspection, the Governors initiated some repairs and visited the hospital at more frequent intervals. During one such visit in 1607, they ordered the purchase of clothing and eating vessels for the inmates, presumably indicating the lack of such basic items.

===Helkiah Crooke===
At the bidding of James VI and I, Helkiah Crooke (1576–1648) was appointed keeper-physician in 1619. As a Cambridge graduate, the author of an enormously successful English language book of anatomy entitled &quot;Microcosmographia: a Description of the Body of Man&quot; (1615) and a member of the medical department of the royal household, he was clearly of higher social status than his city-appointed predecessors (his father was a noted preacher, and his elder brother Thomas was created a baronet). Crooke had successfully ousted the previous keeper, the layman Thomas Jenner, after a campaign in which he had castigated his rival for being &quot;unskilful in the practice of medicine&quot;. While this may appear to provide evidence of the early recognition by the Governors that the inmates of Bethlem required medical care, the formal conditions of Crooke&#x27;s appointment did not detail any required medical duties. Indeed, the Board of Governors continued to refer to the inmates as &quot;the poore&quot; or &quot;prisoners&quot; and their first designation as patients appears to have been by the Privy Council in 1630.

From 1619, Crooke unsuccessfully campaigned through petition to the king for Bethlem to become an independent institution from the Bridewell, a move that while likely meant to serve both monarchial and personal interest would bring him into conflict with the Bridewell Governors. Following a pattern of management laid down by early office-holders, his tenure as keeper was distinguished by his irregular attendance at the hospital and the avid appropriation of its funds as his own. Such were the depredations of his regime that an inspection by the Governors in 1631 reported that the patients were &quot;likely to starve&quot;. Charges against his conduct were brought before the Governors in 1632. Crooke&#x27;s royal favour having dissolved with the death of James I, Charles I instigated an investigation against him in the same year. This established his absenteeism and embezzlement of hospital resources and charged him with failing to pursue &quot;any endeavour for the curing of the distracted persons&quot;. It also revealed that charitable goods and hospital-purchased foodstuffs intended for patients had been typically misappropriated by the hospital steward, either for his own use or to be sold to the inmates. If patients lacked resources to trade with the steward they often went hungry. These findings resulted in the dismissal in disgrace of Crooke, the last of the old-style keepers, along with his steward on 24 May 1633.

===Conditions===

In 1632 it was recorded that the old house of Bethlem had &quot;below stairs a parlour, a kitchen, two larders, a long entry throughout the house, and 21 rooms wherein the poor distracted people lie, and above the stairs eight rooms more for servants and the poor to lie in&quot;. It is likely that this arrangement was not significantly different in the sixteenth century. Although inmates, if deemed dangerous or disturbing, were chained or locked up, Bethlem was an otherwise open building with its inhabitants at liberty to roam around its confines and possibly the local neighbourhood. The neighbouring inhabitants would have been quite familiar with the condition of the hospital as in the 1560s, and probably for some considerable time before that, those who lacked a lavatory in their own homes had to walk through &quot;the west end of the long house of Bethlem&quot; to access the rear of the hospital and reach the &quot;common Jacques&quot;. Typically the hospital appears to have been a receptacle for the very disturbed and troublesome and this fact lends some credence to accounts such as that provided by Donald Lupton in the 1630s who described the &quot;cryings, screechings, roarings, brawlings, shaking of chaines, swearings, frettings, chaffings&quot; that he observed.

Bethlem had been built over a sewer that served both the hospital and its precinct. This common drain regularly blocked, resulting in overflows of waste at the entrance of the hospital. The 1598 visitation by the Governors had observed that the hospital was &quot;filthely kept&quot;, but the Governors rarely made any reference to the need for staff to clean the hospital. The level of hygiene reflected the inadequate water supply, which, until its replacement in 1657, consisted of a single wooden cistern in the back yard from which water had to be laboriously transported by bucket. In the same yard since at least the early seventeenth century there was a &quot;washhouse&quot; to clean patients&#x27; clothes and bedclothes and in 1669 a drying room for clothes was added. Patients, if capable, were permitted to use the &quot;house of easement&quot;, of which there were two at most, but more frequently &quot;piss-pots&quot; were used in their cells. Unsurprisingly, inmates left to brood in their cells with their own excreta were, on occasion, liable to throw such &quot;filth &amp; Excrem[en]t&quot; into the hospital yard or onto staff and visitors. Lack of facilities combined with patient incontinence and prevalent conceptions of the mad as animalistic and dirty, fit to be kept on a bed of straw, appear to have promoted an acceptance of hospital squalor. However, this was an age with very different standards of public and personal hygiene when people typically were quite willing to urinate or defecate in the street or even in their own fireplaces.

For much of the seventeenth century the dietary provision for patients appears to have been inadequate. This was especially so during Crooke&#x27;s regime, when inspection found several patients suffering from starvation. Corrupt staff practices were evidently a significant factor in patient malnourishment and similar abuses were noted in the 1650s and 1670s. The Governors failed to manage the supply of victuals, relying on &quot;gifts in kind&quot; for basic provisions, and the resources available to the steward to purchase foodstuffs was dependent upon the goodwill of the keeper. Patients were fed twice a day on a &quot;lowering diet&quot; (an intentionally reduced and plain diet) consisting of bread, meat, oatmeal, butter, cheese, and generous amounts of beer. It is likely that daily meals alternated between meat and dairy products, almost entirely lacking in fruit or vegetables. That the portions appear to have been inadequate also likely reflected contemporary humoral theory that justified rationing the diet of the mad, the avoidance of rich foods, and a therapeutics of depletion and purgation to restore the body to balance and restrain the spirits.

==1634–1791==

===Medical regime===

The year 1634 is typically interpreted as denoting the divide between the medieval and early modern administration of Bethlem. It marked the end of the day-to-day management by an old-style keeper-physician and its replacement by a three-tiered medical regime composed of a non-resident physician, a visiting surgeon and an apothecary, a model adopted from the royal hospitals. The medical staff were elected by the Court of Governors and, in a bid to prevent profiteering at the expense of patients that had reached its apogee in Crooke&#x27;s era, they were all eventually salaried with limited responsibility for the financial affairs of the hospital. Personal connections, interests and occasionally royal favour were pivotal factors in the appointment of physicians, but by the measure of the times appointees were well qualified as almost all were Oxford or Cambridge graduates and a significant number were candidates for or fellows of the Royal College of Physicians. Although the posts were strongly contested, nepotistic appointment practices played a significant role. The election of James Monro as physician in 1728 marked the beginning of a 125-year Monro family dynasty extending through four generations of fathers and sons. Family influence was also significant in the appointment of surgeons but absent in that of apothecaries.

The office of physician was largely an honorary and charitable one with only a nominal salary. As with most hospital posts, attendance was required only intermittently and the greater portion of the income was derived from private practice. Bethlem physicians, maximising their association with the hospital, typically earned their coin in the lucrative &quot;trade in lunacy&quot; with many acting as visiting physicians to, presiding over, or even, as with the Monros and their predecessor Thomas Allen, establishing their own mad-houses. Initially both surgeons and apothecaries were also without salary and their hospital income was solely dependent upon their presentation of bills for attendance to the Court of Governors. This system was frequently abused and the bills presented were often deemed exorbitant by the Board of Governors. The problem of financial exploitation was partly rectified in 1676, when surgeons received a salary, and from the mid-eighteenth century elected apothecaries were likewise salaried and normally resident within the hospital. Dating from this latter change, the vast majority of medical responsibilities within the institution were undertaken by the sole resident medical officer, the apothecary, owing to the relatively irregular attendance of the physician and surgeon.

The medical regime, being married to a depletive or antiphlogistic physic until the early nineteenth century, had a reputation for conservatism that was neither unearned nor, given the questionable benefit of some therapeutic innovations, necessarily ill-conceived in every instance. Bathing was introduced in the 1680s at a time when hydrotherapy was enjoying a recrudescence in popularity. &quot;Cold bathing&quot;, opined John Monro, Bethlem physician for 40 years from 1751, &quot;has in general an excellent effect&quot;; and remained much in vogue as a treatment throughout the eighteenth century. By the early nineteenth century, bathing was routine for all patients of sufficient hardiness from summer &quot;to the setting-in of the cold weather&quot;. Spring signalled recourse to the traditional armamentarium; from then until the end of summer Bethlem&#x27;s &quot;Mad &quot;Physick&quot;&quot; reigned supreme as all patients, barring those deemed incurable, could expect to be bled and blistered and then dosed with emetics and purgatives. Indiscriminately applied, these curative measures were administered with the most cursory physical examination, if any, and with sufficient excess to risk not only health but also life. Such was the violence of the standard medical course, &quot;involving voiding of the bowels, vomiting, scarification, sores and bruises,&quot; that patients were regularly discharged or refused admission if they were deemed unfit to survive the physical onslaught.

The reigning medical ethos was the subject of public debate in the mid-eighteenth century when the Paper War of 1752–1753 erupted between John Monro and his rival William Battie, physician to the reformist St Luke&#x27;s Asylum of London, founded in 1751. The Bethlem Governors, who had presided over the only public asylum in Britain until the early eighteenth century, looked upon St Luke&#x27;s as an upstart institution and Battie, formerly a Governor at Bethlem, as traitorous. In 1758 Battie published his &quot;Treatise on Madness&quot; which castigated Bethlem as archaic and outmoded, uncaring of its patients and founded upon a despairing medical system whose therapeutic transactions were both injudicious and unnecessarily violent. In contrast, Battie presented St Luke&#x27;s as a progressive and innovative hospital, oriented towards the possibility of cure and scientific in approach. Monro responded promptly, publishing &quot;Remarks on Dr. Battie&#x27;s Treatise on Madness&quot; in the same year.

===Bethlem rebuilt at Moorfields===
Although Bethlem had been enlarged by 1667 to accommodate 59 patients, the Court of Governors of Bethlem and Bridewell observed at the start of 1674 that &quot;the Hospitall House of Bethlem is very olde, weake &amp; ruinous and to[o] small and streight for keepeing the greater numb[e]r of lunaticks therein att p[re]sent&quot;. With the increasing demand for admission and the inadequate and dilapidated state of the building it was decided to rebuild the hospital in Moorfields, just north of the city proper and one of the largest open spaces in London. The architect chosen for the new hospital, which was built rapidly and at great expense between 1675 and 1676, was the natural philosopher and City Surveyor Robert Hooke. He constructed an edifice that was monumental in scale at over wide and some deep. The surrounding walls were some long and deep while the south face at the rear was effectively screened by a 714-foot (218 m) stretch of London&#x27;s ancient wall projecting westward from nearby Moorgate. At the rear and containing the courtyards where patients exercised and took the air, the walls rose to high. The front walls were only high but this was deemed sufficient as it was determined that &quot;Lunatikes... are not to [be] permitted to walk in the yard to be situate[d] betweene the said intended new Building and the Wall aforesaid.&quot; It was also hoped that by keeping these walls relatively low the splendour of the new building would not be overly obscured. This concern to maximise the building&#x27;s visibility led to the addition of six gated openings wide which punctuated the front wall at regular intervals, enabling views of the facade. Functioning as both advertisement and warning of what lay within, the stone pillars enclosing the entrance gates were capped by the figures of &quot;Melancholy&quot; and &quot;Raving Madness&quot; carved in Portland stone by the Danish-born sculptor Caius Gabriel Cibber.
At the instigation of the Bridewell Governors and to make a grander architectural statement of &quot;charitable munificence&quot;, the hospital was designed as a single- rather than double-pile building, accommodating initially 120 patients. Having cells and chambers on only one side of the building facilitated the dimensions of the great galleries, essentially long and capacious corridors, high and wide, which ran the length of both floors to a total span of . Such was their scale that Roger L&#x27;Estrange remarked in a 1676 text eulogising the new Bethlem that their &quot;&quot;Vast&quot; Length ... wearies the travelling eyes&#x27; of &quot;Strangers&quot;&quot;. The galleries were constructed more for public display than for the care of patients as, at least initially, inmates were prohibited from them lest &quot;such persons that come to see the said Lunatickes may goe in Danger of their Lives&quot;.
The architectural design of the new Bethlem was primarily intended to project an image of the hospital and its governors consonant with contemporary notions of charity and benevolence. In an era prior to the state funding of hospitals and with patient fees covering only a portion of costs, such self-advertisement was necessary to win the donations, subscriptions and patronage essential for the institution&#x27;s survival. This was particularly the case in raising funds to pay for major projects of expansion such as the rebuilding project at Moorfields or the addition of the Incurables Division in 1725–39 with accommodation for more than 100 patients. These highly visible acts of civic commitment could also serve to advance the claims to social status or political advantage of its Governors and supporters. However, while consideration of patients&#x27; needs may have been distinctly secondary, they were not absent. For instance, both the placement of the hospital in the open space of Moorfields and the form of the building with its large cells and well-lit galleries had been chosen to provide &quot;health and Aire&quot; in accordance with the miasmatic theory of disease causation.

It was London&#x27;s first major charitable building since the Savoy Hospital (1505–17) and one of only a handful of public buildings then constructed in the aftermath of the Great Fire of London (1666). It would be regarded, during this period at least, as one of the &quot;Prime Ornaments of the City ... and a noble Monument to Charity&quot;. Not least due to the increase in visitor numbers that the new building allowed, the hospital&#x27;s fame and latterly infamy grew and this magnificently expanded Bethlem shaped English and international depictions of madness and its treatment.

===Public visiting===
Visits by friends and relatives were allowed and it was expected that the family and friends of poor inmates would bring food and other essentials for their survival. Bethlem was and is best known for the fact that it also allowed public and casual visitors with no connection to the inmates. This display of madness as public show has often been considered the most scandalous feature of the historical Bedlam.

On the basis of circumstantial evidence, it is speculated that the Bridewell Governors may have decided as early as 1598 to allow public visitors as means of raising hospital income. The only other reference to visiting in the sixteenth-century is provided in a comment in Thomas More&#x27;s 1522 treatise &quot;The Four Last Things&quot;, where he observed that &quot;thou shalt in Bedleem see one laugh at the knocking of his head against a post&quot;. As More occupied a variety of official positions that might have occasioned his calling to the hospital and as he lived nearby, his visit provides no compelling evidence that public visitation was widespread during the sixteenth century. The first apparently definitive documentation of public visiting derives from a 1610 record which details Lord Percy&#x27;s payment of 10 shillings for the privilege of rambling through the hospital to view its deranged denizens. It was also at this time, and perhaps not coincidentally, that Bedlam was first used as a stage setting with the publication of &quot;The Honest Whore, Part I&quot;, in 1604.

Evidence that the number of visitors rose following the move to Moorfields is provided in the observation by the Bridewell Governors in 1681 of &quot;the greate quantity of persons that come daily to see the said Lunatickes&quot;. Eight years later the English merchant and author, Thomas Tryon, remarked disapprovingly of the &quot;Swarms of People&quot; that descended upon Bethlem during public holidays. In the mid-eighteenth-century a journalist of a topical periodical noted that at one time during Easter Week &quot;one hundred people at least&quot; were to be found visiting Bethlem&#x27;s inmates. Evidently Bethlem was a popular attraction, yet there is no credible basis to calculate the annual number of visitors. The claim, still sometimes made, that Bethlem received 96,000 visitors annually is speculative in the extreme. Nevertheless, it has been established that the pattern of visiting was highly seasonal and concentrated around holiday periods. As Sunday visiting was severely curtailed in 1650 and banned seven years later, the peak periods became Christmas, Easter, and Whitsun.
The Governors actively sought out &quot;people of note and quallitie&quot; – the educated, wealthy and well-bred – as visitors. The limited evidence would suggest that the Governors enjoyed some success in attracting such visitors of &quot;quality&quot;. In this elite and idealised model of charity and moral benevolence the necessity of spectacle, the showing of the mad so as to excite compassion, was a central component in the elicitation of donations, benefactions, and legacies. Nor was the practice of showing the poor and unfortunate to potential donators exclusive to Bethlem as similar spectacles of misfortune were performed for public visitors to the Foundling Hospital and Magdalen Hospital for Penitent Prostitutes. The donations expected of visitors to Bethlem – there never was an &quot;official&quot; fee – probably grew out of the monastic custom of almsgiving to the poor. While a substantial proportion of such monies undoubtedly found their way into the hands of staff rather than the hospital poors&#x27; box, Bethlem profited considerably from such charity, collecting on average between £300 and £350 annually from the 1720s until the curtailment of visiting in 1770. Thereafter the poors&#x27; box monies declined to about £20 or £30 per year.

Aside from its fund-raising function, the spectacle of Bethlem offered moral instruction for visiting strangers. For the &quot;educated&quot; observer Bedlam&#x27;s theatre of the disturbed might operate as a cautionary tale providing a deterrent example of the dangers of immorality and vice. The mad on display functioned as a moral exemplum of what might happen if the passions and appetites were allowed to dethrone reason. As one mid-eighteenth-century correspondent commented: &quot;[there is no] better lesson [to] be taught us in any part of the globe than in this school of misery. Here we may see the mighty reasoners of the earth, below even the insects that crawl upon it; and from so humbling a sight we may learn to moderate our pride, and to keep those passions within bounds, which if too much indulged, would drive reason from her seat, and level us with the wretches of this unhappy mansion&quot;.

Whether &quot;persons of quality&quot; or not, the primary allure for visiting strangers was neither moral edification nor the duty of charity but its entertainment value. In Roy Porter&#x27;s memorable phrase, what drew them &quot;was the &quot;frisson&quot; of the freakshow&quot;, where Bethlem was &quot;a rare Diversion&quot; to cheer and amuse. It became one of a series of destinations on the London tourist trail which included such sights as the Tower, the Zoo, Bartholomew Fair, London Bridge and Whitehall. Curiosity about Bethlem&#x27;s attractions, its &quot;remarkable characters&quot;, including figures such as Nathaniel Lee, the dramatist, and Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s porter, Daniel, was, at least until the end of the eighteenth-century, quite a respectable motive for visiting.
From 1770 free public access ended with the introduction of a system whereby visitors required a ticket signed by a Governor.
Visiting subjected Bethlem&#x27;s patients to many abuses, including being poked with sticks by visitors or otherwise taunted, given drinks, and physically assaulted or sexually harassed, but its curtailment removed an important element of public oversight. In the period thereafter, with staff practices less open to public scrutiny, the worst patient abuses occurred.
==1791–1900==

Despite its palatial pretensions, by the end of the eighteenth century Bethlem was physically deteriorating with uneven floors, buckling walls, and a leaking roof. It resembled &quot;a crazy carcass with no wall still vertical – a veritable Hogarthian auto-satire&quot;. The financial cost of maintaining the Moorfields building was onerous and the capacity of the Governors to meet these demands was stymied by shortfalls in Bethlem&#x27;s income in the 1780s occasioned by the bankruptcy of its treasurer; further monetary strains were imposed in the following decade by inflationary wage and provision costs in the context of the Revolutionary wars with France. In 1791, Bethlem&#x27;s Surveyor, Henry Holland, presented a report to the Governors detailing an extensive list of the building&#x27;s deficiencies including structural defects and uncleanliness and estimated that repairs would take five years to complete at a cost of £8,660: only a fraction of this sum was allocated and by the end of the decade it was clear that the problem had been largely unaddressed. Holland&#x27;s successor to the post of Surveyor, James Lewis, was charged in 1799 with compiling a new report on the building&#x27;s condition. Presenting his findings to the Governors the following year, Lewis declared the building &quot;incurable&quot; and opined that further investment in anything other than essential repairs would be financially imprudent. He was, however, careful to insulate the Governors from any criticism concerning Bethlem&#x27;s physical dilapidation as, rather than decrying either Hooke&#x27;s design or the structural impact of additions, he castigated the slipshod nature of its rapid construction. Lewis observed that it had been partly built on land called &quot;the Town Ditch&quot;, a receptacle for rubbish, and this provided little support for a building whose span extended to over . He also noted that the brickwork was not on any foundation but laid &quot;on the surface of the soil, a few inches below the present floor&quot;, while the walls, overburdened by the weight of the roofs, were &quot;neither sound, upright nor level&quot;.

===Bethlem rebuilt at St George&#x27;s Fields===


While the logic of Lewis&#x27;s report was clear, the Court of Governors, facing continuing financial difficulties, only resolved in 1803 behind the project of rebuilding on a new site, and a fund-raising drive was initiated in 1804. In the interim, attempts were made to rehouse patients at local hospitals, and admissions to Bethlem, sections of which were deemed uninhabitable, were significantly curtailed such that the patient population fell from 266 in 1800 to 119 in 1814. Financial obstacles to the proposed move remained significant. A national press campaign to solicit donations from the public was launched in 1805. Parliament was successfully lobbied to provide £10,000 for the fund under an agreement whereby the Bethlem Governors would provide permanent accommodation for any lunatic soldiers or sailors of the French Wars. Early interest in relocating the hospital to a site at Gossey Fields had to be abandoned due to financial constraints and stipulations in the lease for Moorfields that precluded its resale. Instead, the governors engaged in protracted negotiations with the City to swap the Moorfields site for another municipally-owned location at St George&#x27;s Fields in Southwark, south of the Thames. The swap was concluded in 1810 and provided the Governors with a site in a swamp-like, impoverished, highly populated, and industrialised area where the Dog and Duck tavern and St George&#x27;s Spa had been.

A competition was held to design the new hospital at Southwark in which the noted Bethlem patient James Tilly Matthews was an unsuccessful entrant. The governors elected to give James Lewis the task. Incorporating the best elements from the three winning competition designs, he produced a building in the neoclassical style that, while drawing heavily on Hooke&#x27;s original plan, eschewed the ornament of its predecessor. Completed after three years in 1815, it was constructed during the first wave of county asylum building in England under the County Asylums Act 1808 (48 Geo. 3. c. 96). Extending to in length, the new hospital, which ran alongside the Lambeth Road, consisted of a central block with two wings of three storeys on either side. Female patients occupied the west wing and males the east; as at Moorfields, the cells were located off galleries that traversed each wing. Each gallery contained only one toilet, a sink and cold baths. Incontinent patients were kept on beds of straw in cells in the basement gallery; this space also contained rooms with fireplaces for attendants. A wing for the criminally insane – a legal category newly minted in the wake of the trial of a delusional James Hadfield for attempted regicide – was completed in 1816. This addition, which housed 45 men and 15 women, was wholly financed by the state.

The first 122 patients arrived in August 1815 having been transported to their new residence by a convoy of Hackney coaches. Problems with the building were soon noted as the steam heating did not function properly, the basement galleries were damp and the windows of the upper storeys were unglazed &quot;so that the sleeping cells were either exposed to the full blast of cold air or were completely darkened&quot;. Although glass was placed in the windows in 1816, the Governors initially supported their decision to leave them unglazed on the basis that it provided ventilation and so prevented the build-up of &quot;the disagreable effluvias peculiar to all madhouses&quot;. Faced with increased admissions and overcrowding, new buildings, designed by the architect Sydney Smirke, were added from the 1830s. The wing for criminal lunatics was increased to accommodate a further 30 men while additions to the east and west wings, extending the building&#x27;s façade, provided space for an additional 166 inmates and a dome was added to the hospital chapel. At the end of this period of expansion Bethlem had a capacity for 364 patients.

===1815–16 parliamentary inquiry===
The late 18th and early 19th centuries are typically seen as decisive in the emergence of new attitudes towards the management and treatment of the insane. Increasingly, the emphasis shifted from the external control of the mad through physical restraint and coercion to their moral management whereby self-discipline would be inculcated through a system of reward and punishment. For proponents of lunacy reform, the Quaker-run York Retreat, founded in 1796, functioned as an exemplar of this new approach that would seek to re-socialise and re-educate the mad. Bethlem, embroiled in scandal from 1814 over its inmate conditions, would come to symbolise its antithesis.

Through newspaper reports initially and then evidence given to the 1815 Parliamentary Committee on Madhouses, the state of inmate care in Bethlem was chiefly publicised by Edward Wakefield, a Quaker land agent and leading advocate of lunacy reform. He visited Bethlem several times during the late spring and early summer of 1814. His inspections were of the old hospital at the Moorfields site, which was then in a state of disrepair; much of it was uninhabitable and the patient population had been significantly reduced. Contrary to the tenets of moral treatment, Wakefield found that the patients in the galleries were not classified in any logical manner as both highly disturbed and quiescent patients were mixed together indiscriminately. Later, when reporting on the chained and naked state of many patients, Wakefield sought to describe their conditions in such a way as to maximise the horror of the scene while decrying the apparently bestial treatment of inmates and the thuggish nature of the asylum keepers. Wakefield&#x27;s account focused on one patient in particular, James Norris, an American marine reported to be 55 years of age who had been detained in Bethlem since 1 February 1800. Housed in the incurable wing of the hospital, Norris had been continuously restrained for about a decade in a harness apparatus which severely restricted his movement. Wakefield stated that:

Wakefield&#x27;s revelations, combined with earlier reports about patient maltreatment at the York Asylum, helped to prompt a renewed campaign for national lunacy reform and the establishment of an 1815 House of Commons Select Committee on Madhouses, which examined the conditions under which the insane were confined in county asylums, private madhouses, charitable asylums and in the lunatic wards of Poor-Law workhouses.

In June 1816 Thomas Monro, Principal Physician, resigned as a result of scandal when he was accused of &#x27;wanting in humanity&#x27; towards his patients. The Superintendent from 1852 to 1862 was William Charles Hood, who did much to reform and improve conditions for patients at the hospital.

Dr T. B. Hyslop came to the hospital in 1888 and rose to be physician in charge, bringing the hospital into the 20th century and retiring in 1911.

==1930–present==

In 1930, the hospital moved to the suburbs of Croydon, on the site of Monks Orchard House between Eden Park, Beckenham, West Wickham and Shirley. The old hospital and its grounds were bought by Lord Rothermere and presented to the London County Council for use as a park; the central part of the building was retained and became home to the Imperial War Museum in 1936. The hospital was absorbed into the National Health Service in 1948.

===750th anniversary and &quot;Reclaim Bedlam&quot; campaign===

In 1997 the hospital started planning celebrations of its 750th anniversary. The service users&#x27; perspective was not to be included, however, and members of the psychiatric survivors movement saw nothing to celebrate in either the original Bedlam or in the current practices of mental health professionals towards those in need of care. A campaign called &quot;Reclaim Bedlam&quot; was launched by Pete Shaughnessy, supported by hundreds of patients and ex-patients and widely reported in the media. A sit-in was held outside the earlier Bedlam site at the Imperial War Museum. The historian Roy Porter called the Bethlem Hospital &quot;a symbol for man&#x27;s inhumanity to man, for callousness and cruelty.&quot;

===Recent developments===
In 1997, the Bethlem Gallery was established to showcase the work of artists that have experienced mental distress.

In 1999, Bethlem Royal Hospital became part of the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (&quot;SLaM&quot;), along with the Maudsley Hospital in Camberwell, and the merger of mental health services in Lambeth and Lewisham took place.

In 2001, SLaM sought planning permission for an expanded Medium Secure Unit and extensive works to improve security, much of which would be on Metropolitan Open Land. Local residents&#x27; groups organised mass meetings to oppose the application, with accusations that it was unfair that most patients could be from inner London areas and were, therefore, not locals and that drug use was rife in and around the hospital. Bromley Council refused the application, with Croydon Council also objecting. However the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister overturned the decision in 2003 and development started. The 89-bed, £33.5m unit (River House) opened in February 2008. It is the most significant development on the site since the hospital opened in 1930.

===Fatal restraints===
Olaseni Lewis (known as Seni; aged 23) died in 2010 at Bethlem Royal Hospital after police subjected him to prolonged restraint of a type known to be dangerous. Neither police nor medical staff intervened when Lewis became unresponsive. At coroner&#x27;s inquest, the jury found many failures by both police and medical staff which played a part in Lewis&#x27;s death. They said &quot;The excessive force, pain compliance techniques and multiple mechanical restraints were disproportionate and unreasonable. On the balance of probability, this contributed to the cause of death.&quot; Ajibola Lewis, Olaseni Lewis&#x27;s mother, claimed a nurse at Maudsley Hospital where Lewis had been earlier warned against allowing his transfer to Bethlem. &quot;She said to me, &#x27;Look, don&#x27;t let him go to the Bethlem, don&#x27;t let him go there&#x27;,&quot; his mother said. A doctor later persuaded her to take her son to Bethlem hospital. She was concerned about the conditions there. &quot;It was a mess&quot;, she told the court. &quot;It was very confused, a lot of activity, a lot of shouting. I was not happy; I was confused.&quot;

Police were trained to view Lewis&#x27;s behaviour as a medical emergency, but the jury found police failed to act on this. The jury found that &quot;the police failed to follow their training, which requires them to place an unresponsive person into the recovery position and if necessary administer life support. On the balance of probability this also contributed to the cause of death.&quot; A doctor did not act when Lewis became unresponsive while his heart rate dramatically slowed.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission first cleared officers over the death, but following pressure from the family, they scrapped the conclusions and started a new inquiry. The IPCC was planning disciplinary action against some of the police officers involved. Deborah Coles of the charity Inquest, who has supported the Lewis family throughout their campaign, said the jury had reached the most damning possible conclusions on the actions of police and medics. &quot;This was a most horrific death. Eleven police officers were involved in holding down a terrified young man until his complete collapse, legs and hands bound in limb restraints, while mental health staff stood by. Officers knew the dangers of this restraint but chose to go against clear, unequivocal training. Evidence heard at this inquest begs the question of how racial stereotyping informed Seni&#x27;s brutal treatment.&quot;

A disciplinary hearing conducted by the Metropolitan Police found the officers had not committed misconduct. The hearing was criticised by the family because it was held behind closed doors with neither press nor public scrutiny.

In 2014, Chris Brennan (aged 15) died of asphyxiation while at Bethlem hospital after repeated self-harming. The coroner found lack of proper risk assessment and lack of a care plan contributed to his death. The hospital claimed staffing problems and low morale were factors. Lessons were learned and the adolescent unit where Brennan died was assessed as good in 2016.

In November 2017, a bill was debated in the House of Commons that would require psychiatric hospitals to give more detailed information about how and when restraints are used. This bill is referred to as &quot;Seni&#x27;s law&quot;. In November 2018, the bill received Royal Assent as the Mental Health Units (Use of Force) Act 2018.

==Facilities==

The hospital includes specialist services such as the National Psychosis Unit.

Other services include the Bethlem Adolescent Unit, which provides care and treatment for young people aged 12–18 from across the UK.

The hospital has an occupational therapy department, which has its own art gallery, the Bethlem Gallery, displaying work of current and former patients.

The Bethlem Museum of the Mind features exhibits about the history of Bethlem Royal Hospital and the history of mental healthcare and treatment. It features a permanent collection of art created by some of its patients, as well as changing exhibitions.

Every Saturday morning, a parkrun is held in the grounds of Bethlem Royal Hospital.

==Media==
In 2013, the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM) took part in a Channel 4 observational documentary, &quot;Bedlam&quot;. Staff and patients spent two years working with television company The Garden Productions. The four-part series started on 31 October.

The first programme, &quot;Anxiety&quot;, followed patients through the 18-bed Anxiety Disorders Residential Unit. This national unit treats the most anxious people in the country—the top one per cent—and claims a success rate of three in four patients.

The next programme was called &quot;Crisis&quot;; cameras were allowed in Lambeth Hospital&#x27;s Triage ward for the first time. In a postcode with the highest rates of psychosis in Europe, this is the Accident and Emergency of mental health, where patients are at their most unwell.

The third programme, &quot;Psychosis&quot;, films a community mental health team. South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust provides support for more than 35,000 people with mental health problems.

The final programme, &quot;Breakdown&quot;, focuses on older adults, including the inpatient ward for people over 65 with mental health problems at Maudsley Hospital.

<doc id="373048" wikidata="Q4864840" url="?curid=373048" title="Barry Tompkins">
<text>Barry David Tompkins (born May 2, 1940) is an American sportscaster. He is better known for his work as a boxing commentator, but he has covered football and other sports.

==Early life==
Tompkins was born and raised in San Francisco.

==Career==
===KCBS, KPIX, WNBC, NBC Sports and KRON===
He began his broadcasting career at San Francisco radio station KCBS in 1965. Tompkins was hired as sports director at the San Francisco CBS television affiliate, KPIX-TV.

In 1974, he moved to New York to join WNBC-TV as a sports anchor and feature reporter, before moving to NBC Sports in 1975 to host weekly radio shows as well as television play-by-play for basketball and football. Tompkins spent five years at NBC.

Tompkins returned to San Francisco in 1978 and joined then-NBC affiliate KRON-TV as sports director, while continuing to cover Pac-10 basketball for NBC as well as feature stories for its NFL pre-game show. He left KRON in 1980 to join the then-fledgling cable channel HBO.

===HBO (1980-1988)===
At HBO, Tompkins joined &quot;HBO Boxing&quot;, with Larry Merchant and Sugar Ray Leonard. He called fights at HBO for many years and some of his commentaries became famous, such as his call when Alexis Argüello was hurt by Aaron Pryor in round fourteen of their Battle of the Champions (&quot;Arguello...oh! Arguello is hurt!!&quot;), when Héctor Camacho was buckled by Edwin Rosario in round five of their fight (&quot;Camacho had never been hurt before!&quot;) and when Mike Tyson won the WBC world Heavyweight title with a second-round knockout of Trevor Berbick (&quot;And we have a new era in boxing.&quot;). Tompkins also co-hosted HBO&#x27;s baseball program, &quot;Race for the Pennant&quot;.

Even though Tompkins had two years remaining on his contract, HBO replaced him in 1988 with Jim Lampley. Tompkins spent ten years at HBO.

In 1992, he won the Sam Taub Award for excellence in boxing broadcasting journalism.

===KIRO (1986-88)===
From 1986-88, Tompkins called University of Washington Huskies football games alongside UW legend Don Heinrich on 710 KIRO (AM) radio.

===&quot;Rocky IV&quot; and ESPN===
Tompkins made his acting debut in 1985, when he portrayed a USA Network sportscaster during the &quot;Rocky Balboa&quot;-&quot;Ivan Drago&quot; fight in &quot;Rocky IV&quot;. Later he moved to the ESPN network, where he did play-by-play on Thursday Night Fights alongside Al Bernstein. He also did college basketball, The French Open and many other tennis tournaments, the Tour De France, World Track and Field and Swimming and Diving Championships as well as the World Gymnastics Championships. During that time he continued to be &quot;The Voice&quot; of Pac 10 (now 12) Conference football for various syndicators. Tompkins spent eight years at ESPN.

===Fox Sports===
In 1995 Tompkins left ESPN to join Fox Sports as the play-by-play announcer of &quot;Sunday Night Fights&quot;, and he began traveling through the United States alongside Sean O&#x27;Grady and Rich Marotta. Tompkins continued as the lead play-by—play commentator of FSN&#x27;s coverage of Pac-12 football with Petros Papadakis and basketball with Dan Belluomini, Marques Johnson, Don MacLean and Ernie Kent through 2011. He also commentated much of FSN&#x27;s poker coverage, including the Aussie Millions and Poker Dome Challenge. Tompkins spent fourteen years at Fox Sports.

===Western Athletic Conference===
In July 2011 it was announced that Tompkins would leave Pac-12 football broadcasts and instead be the new play-by-play man for the WAC Sports Network, going into its second season. Tompkins&#x27; fight duties and college basketball games with FSN continued. Tompkins called nine broadcasts with Joe Glenn during the 2011 season.

===Mountain West Conference===
The WAC Sports Network folded after 2011 allowing Tompkins to become a free agent in terms of college football sports broadcasting for 2012. He was hired by the Mountain West Conference to serve as their #1 play-by-play broadcaster for the new MWC regional package on Time Warner Cable SportsNet (started after Mtn folded after spring 2012). He was assigned Jay Leeuwenburg as his color analyst.

===ShoBox and ShoExtreme===
Tompkins joined Showtime Sports on February 18, 2012, as blow-by-blow voice of the network&#x27;s ShoBox series and ShoExtreme series with veteran analyst Steve Farhood.

===Dominican University===
In 2013, he joined the faculty at Dominican University of California as a professor for the university&#x27;s Communications Department.

He continues to do college football and basketball for Time-Warner Network and Comcast.

==Personal life==
Tompkins&#x27; wife is Joan Ryan, a sports writer, and son is Ryan Tompkins.
He also called Stanford football where he controversially voted against Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck for the Heisman trophy and his one vote was the difference in Andrew Luck losing out. Thompkins voted for Colt McCoy who didn&#x27;t even play a full season as he was injured.

<doc id="373060" wikidata="Q11774490" url="?curid=373060" title="Broker-dealer">
<text>In financial services, a broker-dealer is a natural person, company or other organization that engages in the business of trading securities for its own account or on behalf of its customers. Broker-dealers are at the heart of the securities and derivatives trading process.

Although many broker-dealers are &quot;independent&quot; firms solely involved in broker-dealer services, many others are business units or subsidiaries of commercial banks, investment banks or investment companies.

When executing trade orders on behalf of a customer, the institution is said to be acting as a [[broker]]. When executing trades for its own account, the institution is said to be acting as a dealer. Securities bought from clients or other firms in the capacity of dealer may be sold to clients or other firms acting again in the capacity of dealer, or they may become a part of the firm&#x27;s holdings.

In addition to execution of securities transactions, broker-dealers are also the main sellers and distributors of mutual fund shares.

== Main points of activity ==
After announcing the price, the dealer must announce other essential conditions of the buy-sell contract of securities: minimum and maximum number of securities subject to purchase and/or sale, as well as the term of announced price&#x27;s validity. Dealers perform all the functions of a stockbroker including financial consulting. They organize and support turnover (liquidity) or market-making (price announcing, duty of sell and buy of security at announced price, announcing of min and max number of securities that can be bought/sold at announced price, implementing time periods when announced prices are available. Dealers are large financial institutions that sell securities to end users and then hedge their risk by partaking in the interdealer market. Interdealers facilitate price discovery and execution between dealers.

==Regulation==
===United States===
In the United States, broker-dealers are regulated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a unit of the U.S. government. All brokers and dealers that are registered with the SEC (pursuant to ), with a number of exceptions, are required to be members of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) (pursuant to ) and are subject to its regulations. Some regulatory authority is further delegated to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a self-regulatory organization. Many states also regulate broker-dealers under separate state securities laws (called &quot;blue sky laws&quot;).

The 1934 Act defines &quot;broker&quot; as &quot;any person engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others&quot;, and defines &quot;dealer&quot; as &quot;any person engaged in the business of buying and selling securities for his own account, through a broker or otherwise&quot;. Under either definition, the person must be performing these functions as a business; if conducting similar transactions on a private basis, they are considered a trader and subject to different requirements. When acting on behalf of customers, broker-dealers have a duty to obtain &quot;best execution&quot; of transactions, which generally means achieving the best economic price under the circumstances.

On April 28, 2004, the SEC voted unanimously to change the net capital rule which applies to broker-dealers, thus allowing those with &quot;tentative net capital&quot; of more than $5 billion to increase their leverage ratios. The rule change remains in effect, though subject to modifications.

Although broker-dealers often provide investment advice to their clients, in many situations they are exempt from registration under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, so long as (i) the investment advice is &quot;solely incidental&quot; to brokerage activities; and (ii) the broker-dealer receives no &quot;special compensation&quot; for providing the investment advice. Both elements of this exemption must be met to rely on it.

Many broker-dealers also serve primarily as distributors for mutual fund shares. These broker-dealers may be compensated in numerous ways and, like all broker-dealers, are subject to compliance with requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission and one or more self-regulatory organizations, such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). The forms of compensation may be sales loads from investors, or Rule 12b-1 fees or servicing fees paid by the mutual funds. There are several online portals that offer broker dealer assistance and search capabilities.

===United Kingdom===
UK securities law uses the term intermediary to refer to businesses involved in the purchase and sale of securities for the account of others.

The Financial Conduct Authority authorises and regulates companies engaging in such activity as &quot;regulated activities&quot; under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.

===Japan===
The common Japanese term for a broker-dealer is . Securities companies are regulated by the Financial Services Agency under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law. The &quot;big five&quot; are Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, SMBC Nikko Securities, Mizuho Securities, and Mitsubishi UFJ Securities. Most major commercial banks in Japan also maintain broker-dealer subsidiaries, as do many foreign commercial banks and investment banks.

Securities companies must be organized as kabushiki kaisha with a statutory auditor or auditing committee, and must maintain minimum shareholder equity of ¥50 million.

<text>In Hinduism, a Brahmarshi (Sanskrit &#x27;, a [[tatpurusha]] compound of&#x27; and &quot;&quot;) is a member of the highest class of Rishis (&quot;seers&quot; or &quot;sages&quot;). A Brahmarshi is a sage who has attained enlightenment and became a Jivanmukta by completely understanding the meaning of Brahman and has attained the highest divine knowledge (omniscience) and self knowledge called Brahmajnana. When a Brahmarshi dies he attains Paramukti and frees himself from Samsara, the cycle of birth and death.

==Order==
The superlative title of &quot;Brahmarshi&quot; is not attested in the Vedas themselves and first appears in the Sanskrit epics.

According to this classification, a Brahmarshi is the ultimate expert of religion and spiritual knowledge known as &#x27;Brahmajnana&#x27;. Below him are the &quot;Maharishis&quot; (&quot;Great Rishis&quot;).

The &quot;Saptarishis&quot; created out of Brahma&#x27;s thoughts are perfect brahmarshis. They are often cited to be at par with the Devas in power and piety in the Puranas.

Bhrigu, Angiras, Atri, Vishwamitra, Kashyapa, Vasishta, and Shandilya are the seven brahmarshis. But there is another list of Saptarishi also who are also Gotra-pravartakas, i.e.,founders of Brahamanical clans, and this second list appeared somewhat later, but belongs to ancient period.

All the hymns of third mandala of the Rig Veda, including the Gayatri mantra, are ascribed to Vishwamitra, who is mentioned as the son of Gaadhi. Vishwamitra is also referred to Kaushika due to his patrilineal lineage using the suffix -ka as &quot;descendant&quot; or &quot;pertaining to&quot;. 

Parasurama and Jamadagni have also been credited the title of Brahmarishi by Bhishma as in Mahabharata.

==The Period of the Manusmriti==
&quot;Brahmarshi-desha&quot;, &#x27;the country of the holy sages,&#x27; includes the territories of the Kurus, Matsyas, Panchalas and Surasenas (i.e. the eastern half of the State of Patiala and of the Delhi division of the Punjab, the Alwar State and adjacent territory in Rajputana, the region which lies between the Ganges and the Jumna, and the Mathura District in the United Provinces).

<doc id="373065" wikidata="Q1455652" url="?curid=373065" title="Polynomial ring">
<text>In mathematics, especially in the field of algebra, a polynomial ring or polynomial algebra is a ring formed from the set of polynomials in one or more indeterminates (traditionally also called variables) with coefficients in another ring, often a field.

Often, the term &quot;polynomial ring&quot; refers implicitly to the special case of a polynomial ring in one indeterminate over a field. The importance of such polynomial rings relies on the high number of properties that they have in common with the ring of the integers.

Polynomial rings occur and are often fundamental in many parts of mathematics such as number theory, commutative algebra, and algebraic geometry. In ring theory, many classes of rings, such as unique factorization domains, regular rings, group rings, rings of formal power series, Ore polynomials, graded rings, have been introduced for generalizing some properties of polynomial rings.

A closely related notion is that of the ring of polynomial functions on a vector space, and, more generally, ring of regular functions on an algebraic variety.

== Definition (univariate case)==
Let be a field or (more generally) a commutative ring.

The polynomial ring in over , which is denoted , can be defined in several equivalent ways. One of them is to define as the set of expressions, called polynomials in , of the form
:formula_1
where , the coefficients of , are elements of , if , and are symbols, which are considered as &quot;powers&quot; of , and follow the usual rules of exponentiation: , , and formula_2 for any nonnegative integers and . The symbol is called an indeterminate or variable. (The term of &quot;variable&quot; comes from the terminology of polynomial functions. However, here, has no value (other than itself), and cannot vary, being a &quot;constant&quot; in the polynomial ring.)

Two polynomials are equal when the corresponding coefficients of each are equal.

One can think of the ring as arising from by adding one new element that is external to , commutes with all elements of , and has no other specific properties. This can be used for an equivalent definition of polynomial rings.

The polynomial ring in over is equipped with an addition, a multiplication and a scalar multiplication that make it a commutative algebra. These operations are defined according to the ordinary rules for manipulating algebraic expressions. Specifically, if 
:formula_3

and
:formula_4

then
:formula_5

and
:formula_6

where ,
:formula_7

and
:formula_8
In these formulas, the polynomials and are extended by adding &quot;dummy terms&quot; with zero coefficients, so that all and that appear in the formulas are defined. Specifically, if , then for .

The scalar multiplication is the special case of the multiplication where is reduced to its &quot;constant term&quot; (the term that is independent of ); that is
:formula_9

It is straightforward to verify that these three operations satisfy the axioms of a commutative algebra over . Therefore, polynomial rings are also called &quot;polynomial algebras&quot;.

Another equivalent definition is often preferred, although less intuitive, because it is easier to make it completely rigorous, which consists in defining a polynomial as an infinite sequence of elements of , having the property that only a finite number of the elements are nonzero, or equivalently, a sequence for which there is some so that for . In this case, and are considered as alternate notations for 
the sequences and , respectively. A straightforward use of the operation rules shows that the expression 
:formula_10
is then an alternate notation for the sequence 

===Terminology===
Let
:formula_1
be a nonzero polynomial with formula_12

The &quot;constant term&quot; of is formula_13 It is zero in the case of the zero polynomial.

The &quot;degree&quot; of , written is formula_14 the largest such that the coefficient of is not zero.

The &quot;leading coefficient&quot; of is formula_15

In the special case of the zero polynomial, all of whose coefficients are zero, the leading coefficient is undefined, and the degree has been variously left undefined, defined to be , or defined to be a .

A &quot;constant polynomial&quot; is either the zero polynomial, or a polynomial of degree zero.

A nonzero polynomial is monic if its leading coefficient is formula_16

Given two polynomials and , if the degree of the zero polynomial is defined to be formula_17 one has 
:formula_18
and, over a field, or more generally an integral domain,
:formula_19

It follows immediately that, if is an integral domain, then so is .

It follows also that, if is an integral domain, a polynomial is a unit (that is, it has a multiplicative inverse) if and only if it is constant and is a unit in .

Two polynomials are associated if either one is the product of the other by a unit.

Over a field, every nonzero polynomial is associated to a unique monic polynomial.

Given two polynomials, and , one says that &quot;divides&quot; , is a &quot;divisor&quot; of , or is a multiple of , if there is a polynomial such that .

A polynomial is irreducible if it is not the product of two non-constant polynomials, or equivalently, if its divisors are either constant polynomials or have the same degree.

=== Polynomial evaluation ===

Let be a field or, more generally, a commutative ring, and a ring containing . For any polynomial in and any element in , the substitution of with in defines an element of , which is denoted . This element is obtained by carrying on in after the substitution the operations indicated by the expression of the polynomial. This computation is called the evaluation of at . For example, if we have 
:formula_20
we have 
:formula_21

(in the first example , and in the second one ). Substituting for itself results in 
:formula_22

explaining why the sentences &quot;Let be a polynomial&quot; and &quot;Let be a polynomial&quot; are equivalent.

The &quot;polynomial function&quot; defined by a polynomial is the function from into that is defined by formula_23 If is an infinite field, two different polynomials define different polynomial functions, but this property is false for finite fields. For example, if is a field with elements, then the polynomials and both define the zero function.

For every in , the evaluation at , that is, the map formula_24 defines an algebra homomorphism from to , which is the unique homomorphism from to that fixes , and maps to . In other words, has the following universal property:
:For every ring containing , and every element of , there is a unique algebra homomorphism from to that fixes , and maps to .

As for all universal properties, this defines the pair up to a unique isomorphism, and can therefore be taken as a definition of . 

The image of the map formula_24, that is, the subset of obtained by substituting for in elements of , is denoted . For example, formula_26, and the simplification rules for the powers of a square root imply formula_27

== Univariate polynomials over a field ==
If is a field, the polynomial ring has many properties that are similar to those of the ring of integers formula_28 Most of these similarities result from the similarity between the long division of integers and the long division of polynomials.

Most of the properties of that are listed in this section do not remain true if is not a field, or if one considers polynomials in several indeterminates.

Like for integers, the Euclidean division of polynomials has a property of uniqueness. That is, given two polynomials and in , there is a unique pair of polynomials such that , and either or . This makes a Euclidean domain. However, most other Euclidean domains (except integers) do not have any property of uniqueness for the division nor an easy algorithm (such as long division) for computing the Euclidean division.

The Euclidean division is the basis of the Euclidean algorithm for polynomials that computes a polynomial greatest common divisor of two polynomials. Here, &quot;greatest&quot; means &quot;having a maximal degree&quot; or, equivalently, being maximal for the preorder defined by the degree. Given a greatest common divisor of two polynomials, the other greatest common divisors are obtained by multiplication by a nonzero constant (that is, all greatest common divisors of and are associated). In particular, two polynomials that are not both zero have a unique greatest common divisor that is monic (leading coefficient equal to ).

The extended Euclidean algorithm allows computing (and proving) Bézout&#x27;s identity. In the case of , it may be stated as follows. Given two polynomials and of respective degrees and , if their monic greatest common divisor has the degree , then there is a unique pair of polynomials such that
:formula_29
and
:formula_30
(For making this true in the limiting case where or , one has to define as negative the degree of the zero polynomial. Moreover, the equality formula_31 can occur only if and are associated.) The uniqueness property is rather specific to . In the case of the integers the same property is true, if degrees are replaced by absolute values, but, for having uniqueness, one must require .

Euclid&#x27;s lemma applies to . That is, if divides , and is coprime with , then divides . Here, &quot;coprime&quot; means that the monic greatest common divisor is . &quot;Proof:&quot; By hypothesis and Bézout&#x27;s identity, there are , , and such that and . So 
formula_32

The unique factorization property results from Euclid&#x27;s lemma. In the case of integers, this is the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. In the case of , it may be stated as: &quot;every non-constant polynomial can be expressed in a unique way as the product of a constant, and one or several irreducible monic polynomials; this decomposition is unique up to the order of the factors.&quot; In other terms is a unique factorization domain. If is the field of complex numbers, the fundamental theorem of algebra asserts that a univariate polynomial is irreducible if and only if its degree is one. In this case the unique factorization property can be restated as: &quot;every non-constant univariate polynomial over the complex numbers can be expressed in a unique way as the product of a constant, and one or several polynomials of the form&quot; ; &quot;this decomposition is unique up to the order of the factors.&quot; For each factor, is a root of the polynomial, and the number of occurrences of a factor is the multiplicity of the corresponding root.

===Derivation===
The (formal) derivative of the polynomial
:formula_33
is the polynomial
:formula_34
In the case of polynomials with real or complex coefficients, this is the standard derivative. The above formula defines the derivative of a polynomial even if the coefficients belong to a ring on which no notion of limit is defined. The derivative makes the polynomial ring a differential algebra.

The existence of the derivative is one of the main properties of a polynomial ring that is not shared with integers, and makes some computations easier on a polynomial ring than on integers.

====Square-free factorization====
====Lagrange interpolation====
====Polynomial decomposition====
=== Factorization ===
Except for factorization, all previous properties of are effective, since their proofs, as sketched above, are associated with algorithms for testing the property and computing the polynomials whose existence are asserted. Moreover these algorithms are efficient, as their computational complexity is a quadratic function of the input size.

The situation is completely different for factorization: the proof of the unique factorization does not give any hint for a method for factorizing. Already for the integers, there is no known algorithm running on a classical (non-quantum) computer for factorizing them in polynomial time. This is the basis of the RSA cryptosystem, widely used for secure Internet communications.

In the case of , the factors, and the methods for computing them, depend strongly on . Over the complex numbers, the irreducible factors (those that cannot be factorized further) are all of degree one, while, over the real numbers, there are irreducible polynomials of degree 2, and, over the rational numbers, there are irreducible polynomials of any degree. For example, the polynomial formula_35 is irreducible over the rational numbers, is factored as formula_36 over the real numbers and, and as formula_37 over the complex numbers.

The existence of a factorization algorithm depends also on the ground field. In the case of the real or complex numbers, Abel–Ruffini theorem shows that the roots of some polynomials, and thus the irreducible factors, cannot be computed exactly. Therefore, a factorization algorithm can compute only approximations of the factors. Various algorithms have been designed for computing such approximations, see Root finding of polynomials.

There is an example of a field such that there exist exact algorithms for the arithmetic operations of , but there cannot exist any algorithm for deciding whether a polynomial of the form formula_38 is irreducible or is a product of polynomials of lower degree.

On the other hand, over the rational numbers and over finite fields, the situation is better than for integer factorization, as there are factorization algorithms that have a polynomial complexity. They are implemented in most general purpose computer algebra systems.

===Minimal polynomial===
If is an element of an associative -algebra , the polynomial evaluation at is the unique algebra homomorphism from into that maps to and does not affect the elements of itself (it is the identity map on ). It consists of &quot;substituting&quot; with in every polynomial. That is, 
: formula_39

The image of this &quot;evaluation homomorphism&quot; is the subalgebra generated by , which is necessarily commutative.
If is injective, the subalgebra generated by is isomorphic to . In this case, this subalgebra is often denoted by . The notation ambiguity is generally harmless, because of the isomorphism.
If the evaluation homomorphism is not injective, this means that its kernel is a nonzero ideal, consisting of all polynomials that become zero when is substituted with . This ideal consists of all multiples of some monic polynomial, that is called the minimal polynomial of . The term &quot;minimal&quot; is motivated by the fact that its degree is minimal among the degrees of the elements of the ideal.

There are two main cases where minimal polynomials are considered.

In field theory and number theory, an element of an extension field of is algebraic over if it is a root of some polynomial with coefficients in . The minimal polynomial over of is thus the monic polynomial of minimal degree that has as a root. Because is a field, this minimal polynomial is necessarily irreducible over . For example, the minimal polynomial (over the reals as well as over the rationals) of the complex number is formula_40. The cyclotomic polynomials are the minimal polynomials of the roots of unity.

In linear algebra, the square matrices over form an associative -algebra of finite dimension (as a vector space). Therefore the evaluation homomorphism cannot be injective, and every matrix has a minimal polynomial (not necessarily irreducible). By Cayley–Hamilton theorem, the evaluation homomorphism maps to zero the characteristic polynomial of a matrix. It follows that the minimal polynomial divides the characteristic polynomial, and therefore that the degree of the minimal polynomial is at most .

=== Quotient ring===
In the case of , the quotient ring by an ideal can be built, as in the general case, as a set of equivalence classes. However, as each equivalence class contains exactly one polynomial of minimal degree, another construction is often more convenient.

Given a polynomial of degree , the &quot;quotient ring&quot; of by the ideal generated by can be identified with the vector space of the polynomials of degrees less than , with the &quot;multiplication modulo &quot; as a multiplication, the &quot;multiplication modulo&quot; consisting of the remainder under the division by of the (usual) product of polynomials. This quotient ring is variously denoted as formula_41 formula_42 formula_43 or simply formula_44

The ring formula_45 is a field if and only if is an irreducible polynomial. In fact, if is irreducible, every nonzero polynomial of lower degree is coprime with , and Bézout&#x27;s identity allows computing and such that ; so, is the multiplicative inverse of modulo . Conversely, if is reducible, then there exist polynomials of degrees lower than such that  ; so are nonzero zero divisors modulo , and cannot be invertible.

For example, the standard definition of the field of the complex numbers can be summarized by saying that it is the quotient ring 
:formula_46 
and that the image of in formula_47 is denoted by . In fact, by the above description, this quotient consists of all polynomials of degree one in , which have the form , with and in formula_48 The remainder of the Euclidean division that is needed for multiplying two elements of the quotient ring is obtained by replacing by in their product as polynomials (this is exactly the usual definition of the product of complex numbers).

Let be an algebraic element in a -algebra . By &quot;algebraic&quot;, one means that has a minimal polynomial . The first ring isomorphism theorem asserts that the substitution homomorphism induces an isomorphism of formula_45 onto the image of the substitution homomorphism. In particular, if is a simple extension of generated by , this allows identifying and formula_50 This identification is widely used in algebraic number theory.

=== Modules ===

The structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain applies to
&quot;K&quot;[&quot;X&quot;], when &quot;K&quot; is a field. This means that every finitely generated module over &quot;K&quot;[&quot;X&quot;] may be decomposed into a direct sum of a free module and finitely many modules of the form formula_51, where &quot;P&quot; is an irreducible polynomial over &quot;K&quot; and &quot;k&quot; a positive integer.

==Definition (multivariate case)==

Given symbols formula_52 called indeterminates, a monomial (also called &quot;power product&quot;) 
:formula_53
is a formal product of these indeterminates, possibly raised to a nonnegative power. As usual, exponents equal to one and factors with a zero exponent can be omitted. In particular, formula_54

The tuple of exponents is called the &quot;multidegree&quot; or &quot;exponent vector&quot; of the monomial. For a less cumbersome notation, the abbreviation
:formula_55
is often used. The &quot;degree&quot; of a monomial , frequently denoted or , is the sum of its exponents:
:formula_56

A &quot;polynomial&quot; in these indeterminates, with coefficients in a field , or more generally a ring, is a finite linear combination of monomials
:formula_57
with coefficients in . The &quot;degree&quot; of a nonzero polynomial is the maximum of the degrees of its monomials with nonzero coefficients.

The set of polynomials in formula_52 denoted formula_59 is thus a vector space (or a free module, if is a ring) that has the monomials as a basis.

formula_60 is naturally equipped (see below) with a multiplication that makes a ring, and an associative algebra over , called &quot;the polynomial ring in indeterminates&quot; over (the definite article &quot;the&quot; reflects that it is uniquely defined up to the name and the order of the indeterminates. If the ring is commutative, formula_60 is also a commutative ring.

===Operations in ===

&quot;Addition&quot; and &quot;scalar multiplication&quot; of polynomials are those of a vector space or free module equipped by a specific basis (here the basis of the monomials). Explicitly, let
formula_62
where and are finite sets of exponent vectors.

The scalar multiplication of and a scalar formula_63 is
:formula_64

The addition of and is
:formula_65
where formula_66 if formula_67 and formula_68 if formula_69 Moreover, if one has formula_70 for some formula_71 the corresponding zero term is removed from the result.

The multiplication is 
:formula_72
where formula_73 is the set of the sums of one exponent vector in and one other in (usual sum of vectors). In particular, the product of two monomials is a monomial whose exponent vector is the sum of the exponent vectors of the factors.

The verification of the axioms of an associative algebra is straightforward.

===Polynomial expression===
A polynomial expression is an expression built with scalars (elements of ), indeterminates, and the operators of addition, multiplication, and exponentiation to nonnegative integer powers.

As all these operations are defined in formula_60 a polynomial expression represents a polynomial, that is an element of formula_75 The definition of a polynomial as a linear combination of monomials is a particular polynomial expression, which is often called the &quot;canonical form&quot;, &quot;normal form&quot;, or &quot;expanded form&quot; of the polynomial. 
Given a polynomial expression, one can compute the &quot;expanded&quot; form of the represented polynomial by &quot;expanding&quot; with the distributive law all the products that have a sum among their factors, and then using commutativity (except for the product of two scalars), and associativity for transforming the terms of the resulting sum into products of a scalar and a monomial; then one gets the canonical form by regrouping the like terms.

The distinction between a polynomial expression and the polynomial that it represents is relatively recent, and mainly motivated by the rise of computer algebra, where, for example, the test whether two polynomial expressions represent the same polynomial may be a nontrivial computation.

=== Categorical characterization ===

If is a commutative ring, the polynomial ring has the following universal property: for every commutative -algebra , and every -tuple of elements of , there is a unique algebra homomorphism from to that maps each formula_76 to the corresponding formula_77 This homomorphism is the &quot;evaluation homomorphism&quot; that consists in substituting formula_76 with formula_79 in every polynomial.

As it is the case for every universal property, this characterizes the pair formula_80 up to a unique isomorphism.

This may also be interpreted in terms of adjoint functors. More precisely, let and be respectively the categories of sets and commutative -algebras (here, and in the following, the morphisms are trivially defined). There is a forgetful functor formula_81 that maps algebras to their underlying sets. On the other hand, the map formula_82 defines a functor formula_83 in the other direction. (If is infinite, is the set of all polynomials in a finite number of elements of .)

The universal property of the polynomial ring means that and are adjoint functors. That is, there is a bijection
:formula_84

This may be expressed also by saying that polynomial rings are free commutative algebras, since they are free objects in the category of commutative algebras. Similarly, a polynomial ring with integer coefficients is the free commutative ring over its set of variables, since commutative rings and commutative algebras over the integers are the same thing.

==Graded structure==
== Univariate over a ring vs. multivariate ==
A polynomial in formula_85 can be considered as a univariate polynomial in the indeterminate formula_86 over the ring formula_87 by regrouping the terms that contain the same power of formula_88 that is, by using the identity
:formula_89
which results from the distributivity and associativity of ring operations.

This means that one has an algebra isomorphism
:formula_90
that maps each indeterminate to itself. (This isomorphism is often written as an equality, which is justified by the fact that polynomial rings are defined up to a &quot;unique&quot; isomorphism.)

In other words, a multivariate polynomial ring can be considered as a univariate polynomial over a smaller polynomial ring. This is commonly used for proving properties of multivariate polynomial rings, by induction on the number of indeterminates.

The main such properties are listed below.

=== Properties that pass from to ===
In this section, is a commutative ring, is a field, denotes a single indeterminate, and, as usual, formula_91 is the ring of integers. Here is the list of the main ring properties that remain true when passing from to .

* If is an integral domain then the same holds for (since the leading coefficient of a product of polynomials is, if not zero, the product of the leading coefficients of the factors).
**In particular, formula_92 and formula_93 are integral domains.
* If is a unique factorization domain then the same holds for . This results from Gauss&#x27;s lemma and the unique factorization property of formula_94 where is the field of fractions of .
**In particular, formula_92 and formula_93 are unique factorization domains.
* If is a Noetherian ring, then the same holds for .
**In particular, formula_92 and formula_93 are Noetherian rings; this is Hilbert&#x27;s basis theorem.
* If is a Noetherian ring, then formula_99 where &quot;formula_100&quot; denotes the Krull dimension.
**In particular, formula_101 and formula_102
* If is a regular ring, then the same holds for ; in this case, one has formula_103 where &quot;formula_104&quot; denotes the global dimension.
**In particular, formula_92 and formula_93 are regular rings, formula_107 and formula_108 The latter equality is Hilbert&#x27;s syzygy theorem.

==Several indeterminates over a field==
Polynomial rings in several variables over a field are fundamental in invariant theory and algebraic geometry. Some of their properties, such as those described above can be reduced to the case of a single indeterminate, but this is not always the case. In particular, because of the geometric applications, many interesting properties must be invariant under affine or projective transformations of the indeterminates. This often implies that one cannot select one of the indeterminates for a recurrence on the indeterminates.

Bézout&#x27;s theorem, Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz and Jacobian conjecture are among the most famous properties that are specific to multivariate polynomials over a field.

=== Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz ===

The Nullstellensatz (German for &quot;zero-locus theorem&quot;) is a theorem, first proved by David Hilbert, which extends to the multivariate case some aspects of the fundamental theorem of algebra. It is foundational for algebraic geometry, as establishing a strong link between the algebraic properties of formula_85 and the geometric properties of algebraic varieties, that are (roughly speaking) set of points defined by implicit polynomial equations.

The Nullstellensatz, has three main versions, each being a corollary of any other. Two of these versions are given below. For the third version, the reader is referred to the main article on the Nullstellensatz.

The first version generalizes the fact that a nonzero univariate polynomial has a complex zero if and only if it is not a constant. The statement is: &quot;a set of polynomials in formula_85 has a common zero in an algebraically closed field containing , if and only if&quot; &quot;does not belong to the ideal generated by , that is, if&quot; &quot;is not a linear combination of elements of with polynomial coefficients&quot;.

The second version generalizes the fact that the irreducible univariate polynomials over the complex numbers are associate to a polynomial of the form formula_111 The statement is: &quot;If is algebraically closed, then the maximal ideals of formula_85 have the form formula_113&quot;

===Bézout&#x27;s theorem===

Bézout&#x27;s theorem may be viewed as a multivariate generalization of the version of the fundamental theorem of algebra that asserts that a univariate polynomial of degree has complex roots, if they are counted with their multiplicities.

In the case of bivariate polynomials, it states that two polynomials of degrees and in two variables, which have no common factors of positive degree, have exactly common zeros in an algebraically closed field containing the coefficients, if the zeros are counted with their multiplicity and include the zeros at infinity.

For stating the general case, and not considering &quot;zero at infinity&quot; as special zeros, it is convenient to work with homogeneous polynomials, and consider zeros in a projective space. In this context, a &quot;projective zero&quot; of a homogeneous polynomial formula_114 is, up to a scaling, a -tuple formula_115 of elements of that is different from , and such that formula_116. Here, &quot;up to a scaling&quot; means that formula_115 and formula_118 are considered as the same zero for any nonzero formula_119 In other words, a zero is a set of homogeneous coordinates of a point in a projective space of dimension .

Then, Bézout&#x27;s theorem states: Given homogeneous polynomials of degrees formula_120 in indeterminates, which have only a finite number of common projective zeros in an algebraically closed extension of , the sum of the multiplicities of these zeros is the product formula_121

===Jacobian conjecture===

==Generalizations==

Polynomial rings can be generalized in a great many ways, including polynomial rings with generalized exponents, power series rings, noncommutative polynomial rings, skew polynomial rings, and polynomial rigs.

=== Infinitely many variables ===
One slight generalization of polynomial rings is to allow for infinitely many indeterminates. Each monomial still involves only a finite number of indeterminates (so that its degree remains finite), and each polynomial is a still a (finite) linear combination of monomials. Thus, any individual polynomial involves only finitely many indeterminates, and any finite computation involving polynomials remains inside some subring of polynomials in finitely many indeterminates. This generalization has the same property of usual polynomial rings, of being the free commutative algebra, the only difference is that it is a free object over an infinite set.

One can also consider a strictly larger ring, by defining as a generalized polynomial an infinite (or finite) formal sum of monomials with a bounded degree. This ring is larger than the usual polynomial ring, as it includes infinite sums of variables. However, it is smaller than the ring of power series in infinitely many variables. Such a ring is used for constructing the ring of symmetric functions over an infinite set.

===Generalized exponents===

A simple generalization only changes the set from which the exponents on the variable are drawn. The formulas for addition and multiplication make sense as long as one can add exponents: . A set for which addition makes sense (is closed and associative) is called a monoid. The set of functions from a monoid &quot;N&quot; to a ring &quot;R&quot; which are nonzero at only finitely many places can be given the structure of a ring known as &quot;R&quot;[&quot;N&quot;], the monoid ring of &quot;N&quot; with coefficients in &quot;R&quot;. The addition is defined component-wise, so that if , then for every &quot;n&quot; in &quot;N&quot;. The multiplication is defined as the Cauchy product, so that if , then for each &quot;n&quot; in &quot;N&quot;, &quot;c&quot;&quot;n&quot; is the sum of all &quot;a&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;b&quot;&quot;j&quot; where &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot; range over all pairs of elements of &quot;N&quot; which sum to &quot;n&quot;.

When &quot;N&quot; is commutative, it is convenient to denote the function &quot;a&quot; in &quot;R&quot;[&quot;N&quot;] as the formal sum:
:formula_122

and then the formulas for addition and multiplication are the familiar:
:formula_123

and
:formula_124

where the latter sum is taken over all &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot; in &quot;N&quot; that sum to &quot;n&quot;.

Some authors such as go so far as to take this monoid definition as the starting point, and regular single variable polynomials are the special case where &quot;N&quot; is the monoid of non-negative integers. Polynomials in several variables simply take &quot;N&quot; to be the direct product of several copies of the monoid of non-negative integers.

Several interesting examples of rings and groups are formed by taking &quot;N&quot; to be the additive monoid of non-negative rational numbers, . See also Puiseux series.

===Power series===
Power series generalize the choice of exponent in a different direction by allowing infinitely many nonzero terms. This requires various hypotheses on the monoid &quot;N&quot; used for the exponents, to ensure that the sums in the Cauchy product are finite sums. Alternatively, a topology can be placed on the ring, and then one restricts to convergent infinite sums. For the standard choice of &quot;N&quot;, the non-negative integers, there is no trouble, and the ring of formal power series is defined as the set of functions from &quot;N&quot; to a ring &quot;R&quot; with addition component-wise, and multiplication given by the Cauchy product. The ring of power series can also be seen as the ring completion of the polynomial ring with respect to the ideal generated by .

===Noncommutative polynomial rings===
For polynomial rings of more than one variable, the products &quot;X&quot;⋅&quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;⋅&quot;X&quot; are simply defined to be equal. A more general notion of polynomial ring is obtained when the distinction between these two formal products is maintained. Formally, the polynomial ring in &quot;n&quot; noncommuting variables with coefficients in the ring &quot;R&quot; is the monoid ring &quot;R&quot;[&quot;N&quot;], where the monoid &quot;N&quot; is the free monoid on &quot;n&quot; letters, also known as the set of all strings over an alphabet of &quot;n&quot; symbols, with multiplication given by concatenation. Neither the coefficients nor the variables need commute amongst themselves, but the coefficients and variables commute with each other.

Just as the polynomial ring in &quot;n&quot; variables with coefficients in the commutative ring &quot;R&quot; is the free commutative &quot;R&quot;-algebra of rank &quot;n&quot;, the noncommutative polynomial ring in &quot;n&quot; variables with coefficients in the commutative ring &quot;R&quot; is the free associative, unital &quot;R&quot;-algebra on &quot;n&quot; generators, which is noncommutative when &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1.

===Differential and skew-polynomial rings===
Other generalizations of polynomials are differential and skew-polynomial rings.

A differential polynomial ring is a ring of differential operators formed from a ring &quot;R&quot; and a derivation &quot;δ&quot; of &quot;R&quot; into &quot;R&quot;. This derivation operates on &quot;R&quot;, and will be denoted &quot;X&quot;, when viewed as an operator. The elements of &quot;R&quot; also operate on &quot;R&quot; by multiplication. The composition of operators is denoted as the usual multiplication. It follows that the relation may be rewritten
as
: formula_125

This relation may be extended to define a skew multiplication between two polynomials in &quot;X&quot; with coefficients in &quot;R&quot;, which make them a noncommutative ring.

The standard example, called a Weyl algebra, takes &quot;R&quot; to be a (usual) polynomial ring &quot;k&quot;[&quot;Y&quot; ], and &quot;δ&quot; to be the standard polynomial derivative formula_126. Taking &quot;a&quot; = &quot;Y&quot; in the above relation, one gets the canonical commutation relation, &quot;X&quot;⋅&quot;Y&quot; − &quot;Y&quot;⋅&quot;X&quot; = 1. Extending this relation by associativity and distributivity allows explicitly constructing the Weyl algebra. .

The skew-polynomial ring is defined similarly for a ring &quot;R&quot; and a ring endomorphism &quot;f&quot; of &quot;R&quot;, by extending the multiplication from the relation &quot;X&quot;⋅&quot;r&quot; = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;r&quot;)⋅&quot;X&quot; to produce an associative multiplication that distributes over the standard addition. More generally, given a homomorphism &quot;F&quot; from the monoid N of the positive integers into the endomorphism ring of &quot;R&quot;, the formula &quot;X&quot;&amp;hairsp;&quot;n&quot;⋅&quot;r&quot; = &quot;F&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)(&quot;r&quot;)⋅&quot;X&quot;&amp;hairsp;&quot;n&quot; allows constructing a skew-polynomial ring. Skew polynomial rings are closely related to crossed product algebras.

=== Polynomial rigs ===

The definition of a polynomial ring can be generalised by relaxing the requirement that the algebraic structure &quot;R&quot; be a field or a ring to the requirement that &quot;R&quot; only be a semifield or rig; the resulting polynomial structure/extension &quot;R&quot;[&quot;X&quot;] is a polynomial rig. For example, the set of all multivariate polynomials with natural number coefficients is a polynomial rig.

<doc id="373067" wikidata="Q2478827" url="?curid=373067" title="Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau">
<text>The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, statutorily named the Tax and Trade Bureau and frequently shortened to TTB, is a bureau of the United States Department of the Treasury, which regulates and collects taxes on trade and imports of alcohol, tobacco, and firearms within the United States.

== Overview ==

TTB was created on January 24, 2003, when the Homeland Security Act of 2002 split the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) into two new organizations with separate functions. Specifically, the Act transferred ATF and its law enforcement functions from the Department of the Treasury to the Department of Justice. ATF&#x27;s other functions, dealing with tax collection and regulation of legitimate trade, remained within the Treasury Department and became part of the new TTB.

== Organization ==

TTB&#x27;s Field Operations are organized into five divisions:
#National Revenue Center: reconciles returns, reports, and claims; screens applications and promptly issues permits; and provides expert technical assistance for industry, the public and government agencies to ensure fair and proper revenue collection and public safety.
#Risk Management: develops, implements, and maintains monitoring programs for collecting the revenue due the Federal Government and protecting the public, and ensures resources are effectively used.
#Tax Audit: verifies the proper payment of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and ammunition excise taxes and ensures compliance with laws and regulations by taxpayers in a manner that protects the revenue, protects the consumer, and promotes voluntary compliance.
#Trade Investigations: comprises investigators who ensure industry compliance with the laws and regulations administered by the TTB.
#Tobacco Enforcement Division: protects the revenue and promotes voluntary compliance by monitoring the domestic tobacco trade, ensuring only qualified applicants enter the tobacco trade, ensuring compliance with the tax laws relating to tobacco, and facilitating TTB&#x27;s enforcement functions in cases of non-compliance.

The Advertising, Labeling, and Formulation Division (ALFD) implements and enforces a broad range of statutory and compliance provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the Federal Alcohol Administration Act. This act requires importers and bottlers of beverage alcohol to obtain certificates of label approval or certificates of exemption from label approval (COLAs) for most alcohol beverages prior to their introduction into interstate commerce. ALFD acts on these COLAs to ensure that products are labeled in accordance with federal laws and regulations. ALFD also examines formulas for wine and distilled spirits, statements of process, and pre-import applications filed by importers and proprietors of domestic distilleries, wineries, and breweries for proper tax classification and to ensure that the products are manufactured in accordance with federal laws and regulations.

<doc id="373076" wikidata="Q1344370" url="?curid=373076" title="Sannyasa">
<text>Sannyasa (), sometimes spelled sanyasa, is the fourth stage within the Hindu system of four life stages known as &quot;ashramas&quot;, the first three being &quot;brahmacharya&quot; (celibate student), &quot;grihastha&quot; (householder) and &quot;vanaprastha&quot; (forest dweller, retired). &quot;Sannyasa&quot; is traditionally conceptualized for men or women in the last years of their life, but young &quot;brahmachari&quot;s have the choice to skip the householder and retirement stages, renounce worldly and materialistic pursuits and dedicate their lives to spiritual pursuits.

&quot;Sannyasa&quot;, a form of asceticism marked by renunciation of material desires and prejudices, is characterized by a state of disinterest in and detachment from material life, with the purpose of spending one&#x27;s life in peaceful, spiritual pursuits. An individual in Sanyasa is known as a &quot;sannyasi&quot; (male) or &quot;sannyasini&quot; (female) in Hinduism. Sannyasa shares similarities with the Sadhu and Sadhvi traditions of Jain monasticism, and the sannyasi and sannyasini share similarity with the bhikkhus and bhikkhunis of Buddhism.

&quot;Sannyasa&quot; has historically been a stage of renunciation, ahimsa (non-violence), a peaceful and simple life and spiritual pursuit in Indian traditions. However, this has not always been the case. After the invasions and establishment of Muslim rule in India, from the 12th century through the British Raj, parts of the Shaiva (Gossain) and Vaishnava (Bairagi) ascetics metamorphosed into a military order, where they developed martial arts, created military strategies, and engaged in guerrilla warfare. These warrior &quot;sanyasi&quot; (ascetics) played an important role in helping European colonial powers establish themselves in the Indian subcontinent.

==Etymology and synonyms==
&#x27; in Sanskrit nyasa means purification, sannyasa means &quot;Purification of Everything&quot;. It is a composite word of  which means &quot;together, all&quot;, &quot;ni-&quot; which means &quot;down&quot; and &#x27; from the root &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;to throw&quot; or &quot;to put&quot;. A literal translation of Sannyāsa is thus &quot;to put down everything, all of it&quot;. Sannyasa is sometimes spelled as &quot;Sanyasa&quot;.

The term &quot;Saṃnyasa&quot; makes appearance in the Samhitas, Aranyakas and Brahmanas, the earliest layers of Vedic literature (2nd millennium BCE), but it is rare. It is not found in ancient Buddhist or Jaina vocabularies, and only appears in Hindu texts of the 1st millennium BCE, in the context of those who have given up ritual activity and taken up non-ritualistic spiritual pursuits discussed in the Upanishads. The term &quot;Sannyasa&quot; evolves into a rite of renunciation in ancient Sutra texts, and thereafter became a recognized, well discussed stage of life (Ashrama) by about the 3rd and 4th century CE.

Sanyasis are also known as Bhiksu, Pravrajita/Pravrajitā, Yati, Sramana and Parivrajaka in Hindu texts.

==History==
Jamison and Witzel state early Vedic texts make no mention of &quot;Sannyasa&quot;, or &quot;Ashrama system&quot;, unlike the concepts of Brahmacharin and Grihastha which they do mention. Instead, Rig Veda uses the term &quot;Antigriha&quot; (अन्तिगृह) in hymn 10.95.4, as still a part of the extended family, where older people lived in ancient India, with an outwardly role. It is in later Vedic era and over time, that &quot;Sannyasa&quot; and other new concepts emerged, while older ideas evolved and expanded. A three-stage Ashrama concept, along with Vanaprastha, emerged about or after 7th Century BC, when sages such as Yājñavalkya left their homes and roamed around as spiritual recluses and pursued their &quot;Pravrajika&quot; (wanderer) lifestyle. The explicit use of the four-stage Ashrama concept appeared a few centuries later.

However, early Vedic literature from 2nd millennium BC mentions &quot;Muni&quot; (मुनि, monks, mendicants, holy men), with characteristics that mirror those found in later &quot;Sannyasins&quot; and &quot;Sannyasinis&quot;. For example, the Rig Veda, in Book 10 Chapter 136, mentions Munis as those with &quot;Kesin&quot; (केशिन्, long haired) and &quot;Mala&quot; clothes (मल, soil-colored, yellow, orange, saffron), engaged in the affairs of &quot;Mananat&quot; (mind, meditation). The Rigveda, however, refers to these people as &quot;Muni&quot; and &quot;Vati&quot; (वति, monks who beg).

These &quot;Munis&quot;, their lifestyle and spiritual pursuit, likely influenced the Sannyasa concept, as well as the ideas behind the ancient concept of Brahmacharya (bachelor student). One class of &quot;Munis&quot; were associated with Rudra. Another were &quot;Vratyas&quot;.

==Lifestyle and goals==
Hinduism has no formal demands nor requirements on the lifestyle or spiritual discipline, method or deity a Sanyasin or Sanyasini must pursue – it is left to the choice and preferences of the individual. This freedom has led to diversity and significant differences in the lifestyle and goals of those who adopt Sannyasa. There are, however, some common themes. A person in &quot;Sannyasa&quot; lives a simple life, typically detached, itinerant, drifting from place to place, with no material possessions or emotional attachments. They may have a walking stick, a book, a container or vessel for food and drink, often wearing yellow, saffron, orange, ochre or soil colored clothes. They may have long hair and appear disheveled, and are usually vegetarians. Some minor Upanishads as well as monastic orders consider women, children, students, fallen men (those with a criminal record) and others as not qualified to become &quot;Sannyasa&quot;; while other texts place no restrictions. The dress, the equipage and lifestyle varies between groups. For example, Sannyasa Upanishad in verses 2.23 to 2.29, identifies six lifestyles for six types of renunciates. One of them is described as living with the following possessions,

Those who enter Sannyasa may choose whether they join a group (similar to Christian mendicant orders). Some are anchorites, homeless mendicants preferring solitude and seclusion in remote parts, without affiliation. Others are cenobites, living and traveling with kindred fellow-Sannyasi in the pursuit of their spiritual journey, sometimes in Ashramas or Matha/Sangha (a Hermitage, the practice of seclusion known generally as monasticism).

Most Hindu ascetics adopt celibacy when they begin Sannyasa. However, there are exceptions, such as the Saiva Tantra school of asceticism where ritual sex is considered part of liberation process. Sex is viewed by them as a transcendence from a personal, intimate act to something impersonal and ascetic.

===The goal===
The goal of the Hindu Sannyasin is moksha (liberation). The idea of what that means varies from tradition to tradition.

For the Bhakti (devotion) traditions, liberation consists of being an eternal servant to the Divine and release from Saṃsāra (rebirth in future life); for Yoga traditions, liberation is the experience of the highest Samādhi (deep awareness in this life); and for the Advaita tradition, liberation is jivanmukti – the awareness of the Supreme Reality (Brahman) and Self-realization in this life. Sannyasa is a means and an end in itself. It is a means to decreasing and then ultimately ending all ties of any kind. It is a means to the soul and meaning, but not ego nor personalities. Sannyasa does not abandon the society, it abandons the ritual mores of the social world and one&#x27;s attachment to all its other manifestations. The end is a liberated, content, free and blissful existence.

===The behaviors and characteristics===

The behavioral state of a person in &quot;Sannyasa&quot; is described by many ancient and medieval era Indian texts. Bhagavad Gita discusses it in many verses, for example:

Other behavioral characteristics, in addition to renunciation, during Sannyasa include: ahimsa (non-violence), akrodha (not become angry even if you are abused by others), disarmament (no weapons), chastity, bachelorhood (no marriage), avyati (non-desirous), amati (poverty), self-restraint, truthfulness, sarvabhutahita (kindness to all creatures), asteya (non-stealing), aparigraha (non-acceptance of gifts, non-possessiveness) and shaucha (purity of body, speech and mind). Some Hindu monastic orders require the above behavior in form of a vow, before a renunciate can enter the order. Tiwari notes that these virtues are not unique to &quot;Sannyasa&quot;, and other than renunciation, all of these virtues are revered in ancient texts for all four &quot;Ashrama (stage)&quot; of human life.

Baudhayana Dharmasūtra, completed by about 7th century BC, states the following behavioral vows for a person in &quot;Sannyasa&quot;

===Types===
Ashrama Upanishad identified various types of Sannyasi renouncers based on their different goals: Kutichaka – seeking atmospheric world; Bahudaka – seeking heavenly world; Hamsa – seeking penance world; Paramahamsa – seeking truth world; and Turiyatitas and Avadhutas seeking liberation in this life.

In some texts, such as Sannyasa Upanishad, these were classified by the symbolic items the Sannyasins carried and their lifestyle. For example, Kutichaka sannyasis carried triple staffs, Hamsa sannyasis carried single staffs, while Paramahamsas went without them. This method of classification based on emblematic items became controversial, as anti-thematic to the idea of renunciation. Later texts, such as Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad stated that all renunciation is one, but people enter the state of Sannyasa for different reasons – for detachment and getting away from their routine meaningless world, to seek knowledge and meaning in life, to honor rites of Sannyasa they have undertaken, and because he already has liberating knowledge.

;Other classifications
There were many groups of Hindu, Jain and Buddhist Sannyasis co-existing in pre-Maurya Empire era, each classified by their attributes, such as: Achelakas (without clothes), Ajivika, Aviruddhaka, Devadhammika, Eka-satakas, Gotamaka, Jatilaka, Magandika, Mundasavaka, Nigrantha (Jains), Paribbajaka, Tedandikas, Titthiya and others.

==Literature==

The Dharmasūtras and Dharmaśāstras, composed about mid 1st millennium BC and later, place increasing emphasis on all four stages of &quot;Ashrama system&quot; including &quot;Sannyasa&quot;. The Baudhayana Dharmasūtra, in verses 2.11.9 to 2.11.12, describes the four Ashramas as &quot;a fourfold division of Dharma&quot;. The newer Dharmaśāstra vary widely in their discussion of &quot;Ashrama&quot; system .

The Dharmasūtras and Dharmaśāstras give a number of detailed but widely divergent guidelines on renunciation. In all cases, Sannyasa was never mandatory and was one of the choices before an individual. Only a small percentage chose this path. Olivelle posits that the older Dharmasūtras present the &quot;Ashramas&quot; including &quot;Sannyasa&quot; as four alternative ways of life and options available, but not as sequential stage that any individual must follow. Olivelle also states that &quot;Sannyasa&quot; along with the Ashrama system gained mainstream scholarly acceptance about 2nd century BC.

Ancient and medieval era texts of Hinduism consider &quot;Grihastha&quot; (householder) stage as the most important of all stages in sociological context, as human beings in this stage not only pursue a virtuous life, they produce food and wealth that sustains people in other stages of life, as well as the offspring that continues mankind. However, an individual had the choice to renounce any time he or she wanted, including straight after student life.

===When can a person renounce?===
Baudhayana Dharmasūtra, in verse II.10.17.2 states that anyone who has finished Brahmacharya (student) life stage may become ascetic immediately, in II.10.17.3 that any childless couple may enter Sannyasa anytime they wish, while verse II.10.17.4 states that a widower may choose Sannyasa if desired, but in general, states verse II.10.17.5, Sannyasa is suited after the completion of age 70 and after one&#x27;s children have been firmly settled. Other texts suggest the age of 75.

The &#x27; and &quot;Āpastamba Dharmasūtra&quot;s, and the later &#x27; describe the &quot;āśrama&quot;s as sequential stages which would allow one to pass from Vedic studentship to householder to forest-dwelling hermit to renouncer. However, these texts differ with each other. Yājñavalkya Smṛti, for example, differs from Manusmṛti and states in verse 3.56 that one may skip Vanaprastha (forest dwelling, retired) stage and go straight from the &quot;Grihastha&quot; (householder) stage to &quot;Sannyasa&quot;.

===Who may renounce?===
The Jabala Upanishad mentions one who gets vairagya of any class or gender can renounce or take sanyasa. Nevertheless, Dharmaśāstra texts document people of all castes as well as women, entered &quot;Sannyasa&quot; in practice.

===What happened to renouncers&#x27; property and human rights?===
After renouncing the world, the ascetic&#x27;s financial obligations and property were adjudicated by the state, in the manner of a decedent&#x27;s estate. Viṣṇu Smriti in verse 6.27, for example, states that if a debtor takes &quot;Sannyasa&quot;, his sons or grandsons should settle his debts. As to the little property a Sannyasin may collect or possess after renunciation, Book III Chapter XVI of Kautiliya&#x27;s Arthashastra states that the property of hermits (vánaprastha), ascetics (yati, sannyasa), and student bachelors (Brahmachári) shall on their death be taken by their &quot;guru&quot;, disciples, their &quot;dharmabhratri&quot; (brother in the monastic order), or classmates in succession.

Although a renouncer&#x27;s practitioner&#x27;s obligations and property rights were reassigned, he or she continued to enjoy basic human rights such as the protection from injury by others and the freedom to travel. Likewise, someone practicing Sannyasa was subject to the same laws as common citizens; stealing, harming, or killing a human being by a Sannyasi were all serious crimes in Kautiliya&#x27;s Arthashastra.

===Renunciation in daily life===
Later Indian literature debates whether the benefit of renunciation can be achieved (&quot;moksha,&quot; or liberation) without asceticism in the earlier stages of one&#x27;s life. For example, Bhagavad Gita, Vidyaranya&#x27;s &quot;Jivanmukti Viveka,&quot; and others believed that various alternate forms of yoga and the importance of yogic discipline could serve as paths to spirituality, and ultimately &quot;moksha&quot;. Over time, four paths to liberating spirituality have emerged in Hinduism: Jñāna yoga, Bhakti yoga, Karma yoga and Rāja yoga. Acting without greed or craving for results, in Karma yoga for example, is considered a form of detachment in daily life similar to &quot;Sannyasa&quot;. Sharma states that, &quot;the basic principle of Karma yoga is that it is not what one does, but how one does it that counts and if one has the know-how in this sense, one can become liberated by doing whatever it is one does&quot;, and &quot;(one must do) whatever one does without attachment to the results, with efficiency and to the best of one&#x27;s ability&quot;.

==Warrior ascetics==

Ascetic life was historically a life of renunciation, non-violence and spiritual pursuit. However, in India, this has not always been the case. For example, after the Mongol and Persian Islamic invasions in the 12th century, and the establishment of Delhi Sultanate, the ensuing Hindu-Muslim conflicts provoked the creation of a military order of Hindu ascetics in India. These warrior ascetics formed paramilitary groups called ‘‘Akharas&#x27;’ and they invented a range of martial arts.

&quot;Nath Siddhas&quot; of the 12th century AD, may have been the earliest Hindu monks to resort to a military response after the Muslim conquest. Ascetics, by tradition, led a nomadic and unattached lifestyle. As these ascetics dedicated themselves to rebellion, their groups sought stallions, developed techniques for spying and targeting, and they adopted strategies of war against Muslim nobles and the Sultanate state. Many of these groups were devotees of Hindu deity Mahadeva, and were called &quot;Mahants&quot;. Other popular names for them was &quot;Sannyasis&quot;, &quot;Yogis&quot;, &quot;Nagas&quot; (followers of Shiva), &quot;Bairagis&quot; (followers of Vishnu) and &quot;Gosains&quot; from the 16th to the 19th centuries; in some cases, these Hindu monks cooperated with Muslim fakirs who were Sufi and also persecuted.

Warrior monks continued their rebellion through the Mughal Empire, and became a political force during the early years of British Raj. In some cases, these regiments of soldier monks shifted from guerrilla campaigns to war alliances, and these Hindu warrior monks played a key role in helping British establish themselves in India. The significance of warrior ascetics rapidly declined with the consolidation of British Raj in late 19th century, and with the rise in non-violence movement by Mahatma Gandhi.

Novetzke states that some of these Hindu warrior ascetics were treated as folk heroes, aided by villagers and townspeople, because they targeted figures of political and economic power in a discriminatory state, and some of these warriors paralleled Robin Hood&#x27;s lifestyle.

==Upanishads==
Sannyasa, or the renunciant way of life, is discussed in various Upanishads.

=== Major Upanishads ===
Among the thirteen major or Principal Upanishads, all from the ancient era, many include sections related to &quot;Sannyasa&quot;. The Mundaka Upanishad discusses the path of &quot;Sannyasa&quot; as a means to attain spiritual knowledge and liberation. It emphasizes the renunciant&#x27;s simple and austere lifestyle in pursuit of wisdom. The motivations and state of a &quot;Sannyasi&quot; are mentioned in Maitrāyaṇi Upanishad, a classical major Upanishad that Robert Hume included among his list of &quot;Thirteen Principal Upanishads&quot; of Hinduism. Maitrāyaṇi starts with the question, &quot;given the nature of life, how is joy possible?&quot; and &quot;how can one achieve moksha (liberation)?&quot;; in later sections it offers a debate on possible answers and its views on Sannyasa.


=== Sannyasa Upanishads ===
Of the 108 Upanishads of the Muktika, the largest corpus is dedicated to &quot;Sannyasa&quot; and to Yoga, or about 20 each, with some overlap. The renunciation-related texts are called the Sannyasa Upanishads. These are as follows:

Six of the Sannyasa Upanishads – Aruni, Kundika, Kathashruti, Paramahamsa, Jabala and Brahma – were composed before the 3rd-century CE, likely in the centuries before or after the start of the common era, states Sprockhoff; the Asrama Upanishad is dated to the 3rd-century, the Naradaparivrajaka and Satyayaniya Upanishads to around the 12th-century, and about ten of the remaining Sannyasa Upanishads are dated to have been composed in the 14th- to 15th-century CE well after the start of Islamic Sultanates period of South Asia in late 12th-century.

The oldest Sannyasa Upanishads have a strong Advaita Vedanta outlook, and these pre-date Adi Shankara. Most of the Sannyasa Upanishads present a Yoga and nondualism (Advaita) Vedanta philosophy. This may be, states Patrick Olivelle, because major Hindu monasteries of early medieval period (1st millennium CE) belonged to the Advaita Vedanta tradition. The 12th-century Shatyayaniya Upanishad is a significant exception, which presents qualified dualistic and Vaishnavism (Vishishtadvaita Vedanta) philosophy.

<text>Rajarshi () is a title in Hinduism and Hindu mythology, referring to a sage who hails from a royal background.

==Description==
A rajarshi may be described to be a king (raja) who adopted a path of devotion, thereby becoming a royal sage (rishi). A rajarshi does not have to leave the kingship to become rishi&quot;,&quot; as in the example of Vishvamitra (who later becomes a &quot;Brahmarishi&quot;), but could attain the status of a sage through self-realisation during his reign. A rajarshi still performs the duties of their kshatriya class, and remain similar to most rishis, maharishis, and brahmarishis descendants in their level of spiritual knowledge. Another example of Rajarshi is King Janaka, who is said to have attained self-Knowledge from the ascetic sage Astavakra. 

They belong to the four types of rishis mentioned in Hinduism and Vedas.
# Rajarshi
# Maharishi
# Brahmarshi
# Devarishi

== Literature ==
In the Ramayana, Brahma proclaims Vishvamitra to be a rajarshi in response to the sage performing austerities for a thousand years.

<text>Carl Hellmuth Hertz (also written Carl Helmut Hertz, 15 October 1920 – 29 April 1990) was a German physicist known primarily for being involved in the development of inkjet technology and ultrasound technology. He was the son of Gustav Ludwig Hertz and great nephew of Heinrich Hertz.

== Biography ==
Hellmuth Hertz was born on 15 October 1920 in Berlin, Germany. His father was Gustav Hertz who, along with James Franck, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics 1925 for their experiments on inelastic electron collisions in gases. Gustav Hertz&#x27;s uncle was in turn Heinrich Hertz, who first conclusively proved the existence of the electromagnetic waves.

Hellmuth graduated from the elite Schule Schloss Salem boarding school in 1939 at the age of 19 years with the highest grade in mathematics and physics. The same year, he was conscripted into the German Army (Wehrmacht) and served as a soldier for Nazi Germany in World War II. In 1943 he was captured in the North African theatre by US troops and brought to America, where he was placed in a prisoner-of-war camp until 1946. Because his father did some research in the Soviet Union at that time, he could not get a job in the US. Instead, he got a job at the Department of Physics in Lund University in Sweden with the assistance of James Franck and the Nobel laureate Niels Bohr, who were both friends of Gustav Hertz.

From 1961 he was a teacher at Lund University, and from 1963 he was Professor of Electrical Measurement Technology in Lund. He was involved in the development of both the inkjet and the ultrasound technology. He produced the first echocardiographs together with the Swedish physician Inge Edler. He was married to Birgit Nordbring and was the father of Thomas and Hans Hertz, and he died on 29 April 1990.

<doc id="373089" wikidata="Q6614780" url="?curid=373089" title="List of crossings of the River Severn">
<text>This is a list of crossings of the [[River Severn]] in Great Britain (including bridges, tunnels, ferries and fords), in order from source to mouth.

The Severn has historically been a very important and busy river, and has been bridged throughout history. The bridges that stand today are often of great historical and/or engineering interest. For example, the world&#x27;s first iron bridge, The Iron Bridge, built from cast iron, crosses the River Severn at Ironbridge Gorge. The Iron Bridge is one of three bridges on the River Severn that are listed as grade I structures, including Bewdley Bridge and the Severn Bridge, which was opened in 1966. In total, 31 bridges that cross the River Severn are listed, either grade I, II* or II. Four bridges are scheduled monuments, including The Iron Bridge, which are nationally important archaeological bridges.

Many reaches of the Severn are prone to severe flooding, prompting the design of some unique bridges to cope with this.

There were historically also ferry crossings on the tidal river at:
* Minsterworth
* Framilode
* Purton, Lydney
* Newnham on Severn

<doc id="373092" wikidata="Q5280280" url="?curid=373092" title="Direct Hits (The Who album)">
<text>Direct Hits is the first UK compilation album and the fourth UK LP released by The Who. It collects singles, B-sides, and album tracks originally recorded for Reaction Records and Track Records between 1966 and 1968. 

Earlier Who recordings from 1965, such as &quot;My Generation&quot;, were released in the UK by Brunswick Records and were not available for this release due to music licensing issues. Thus the collection is not representative of the Who&#x27;s hit recordings up to this point.

&quot;Direct Hits&quot; shares a few songs with the earlier US compilation album &quot;Magic Bus: The Who on Tour&quot;, but is otherwise unrelated to that release. Surprisingly, it does not include the song &quot;Magic Bus&quot;, which had reached No. 26 on the UK Singles Chart during the summer of 1968. Until the early 1980s this was the only album to include Who rarities such as &quot;In the City&quot;, &quot;Dogs&quot;, and a version of the Rolling Stones&#x27; song &quot;The Last Time&quot;.

==Release history==
Original 1968 UK LP copies were released in both stereo and mono. The album did not sell as well as other UK Who albums and it was deleted in the 1970s. It was released in Czechoslovakia in 1985 with a different artwork titled &quot;The Best of The Who&quot;. It was also re-issued on vinyl in 1980 in Japan. In 2006 the mono version was made available in the US as a limited-edition vinyl re-issue by Classic Records. This release was pressed in regular weight (150 gram) and heavy weight (200 gram) versions. 

A CD version was released as a limited edition in Japan in 2007, which is one of only a few releases with the original mono single version of &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot; on an authorized CD.

<text>Shastra ( ) is a Sanskrit word that means &quot;precept, rules, manual, compendium, book or treatise&quot; in a general sense. The word is generally used as a suffix in the Indian literature context, for technical or specialized knowledge in a defined area of practice.

&quot;Shastra&quot; has a similar meaning to English &quot;-logy&quot;, e.g. ecology, psychology, meaning scientific and basic knowledge on a particular subject. Examples in terms of modern neologisms include
# &#x27;physics&#x27;, 
#  &#x27;chemistry&#x27;, 
# &#x27;biology&#x27;, 
#  &#x27;architectural science&#x27;, 
#  &#x27;science of mechanical arts and sculpture&#x27;,
#  &#x27;science of politics and economics&#x27;, and
# &#x27;compendium of ethics or right policy&#x27;.

In Western literature, &quot;Shastra&quot; is sometimes spelled as Sastra, reflecting a misunderstanding of the IAST symbol &#x27;ś&#x27;, which corresponds to the English &#x27;sh&#x27;.

==Etymology ==
The word &quot;Śāstra&quot; literally means &quot;that which has been instructed/decreed&quot;, from the root √śās- which means &quot;instruction/decree&quot; combined with the &quot;ṣṭran-suffix&quot;.

===Terminology===
&quot;Shastra&quot; commonly refers to a treatise or text on a specific field of knowledge. In early Vedic literature, the word referred to any precept, rule, teaching, ritual instruction or direction. In late and post Vedic literature of Hinduism, &quot;Shastra&quot; referred to any treatise, book or instrument of teaching, any manual or compendium on any subject in any field of knowledge, including religious. It is often a suffix, added to the subject of the treatise, such as 
# Yoga-shastra
# Nyaya-shastra
# Dharma-shastra
# Koka- or Kama-shastra, 
# Moksha-shastra
# Artha-shastra
# Alaṅkara-shastra (rhetoric)
# Kāvya-shastra (poetics)
# Saṅgīta-shastra (music)
# Nāṭya-shastra (theatre &amp; dance)
# Vyākaraṇa-shāstra (Sanskrit grammar), and others.

In Buddhism, a &quot;shastra&quot; is often a commentary written at a later date to explain an earlier scripture or sutra. For example, Yutang Lin says that a text written by him and not given by Buddha, cannot be called a &quot;Sutra&quot;; it is called a &quot;Sastra&quot;. In Buddhism, Buddhists are allowed to offer their theses as long as they are consistent with the Sutras, and those are called &quot;Sastras.&quot;

In Jainism, the term means the same as in Hinduism. An example of Jaina Shastra is the 12th-century &quot;Yoga Shastra of Hemchandracharya&quot;.

Shastra is sometimes the root of compounded Sanskrit words. A custodian of &quot;Shastra&quot;, for example, is called &quot;Shastradhari&quot; (Sanskrit: शास्त्रधारी).

==References in the early texts==
The term is found in several passages of the Rigveda (2nd millennium BCE), such as in hymn VIII.33.16.

In this Rigvedic verse, the term means rule or instruction.

The Maitri Upanishad (mid to late 1st millennium BCE), similarly, mentions the materialist Charvakas and Brihaspati who disagreed that the Vedas are a treatise of knowledge, proposing relativism instead, in the following passage:

The term is found in other Upanishads as well as in Bhagavad Gita such as in verses 15.20, 16.23–16.24, and 17.1.

The &#x27; (11.36; 14.30) uses the term &quot;Shastra&quot; to refer to the &#x27; tradition. , and &#x27;s &#x27; use the term. Similarly, the &#x27; uses the term to refer to astronomical treatises. The term &#x27;, refers to the &#x27; of the &quot;&quot;s.

The term &quot;&#x27;&quot; is found in Yaska&#x27;s &quot;Nirukta&quot; (1.2, 14), where the reference is to &quot;Nirukta&quot; (etymology). An early use of the term &#x27; with reference to the literature on &quot;dharma&quot; is found in the &#x27; of , who uses the expression &#x27;

==Chronology and authenticity==
Shastras are predominantly post-Vedic literature, that is after about 500 BCE. However, it is unclear when various Shastras were composed and completed. The authenticity of the manuscripts is also unclear, as many versions of the same text exist, some with major differences. Patrick Olivelle, credited with a 2005 translation of Manu Dharma-sastra, published by the Oxford University Press, states the concerns in postmodern scholarship about the presumed authenticity and reliability of manuscripts as follows (abridged):

The literature of late 1st millennium BCE such as Arthashastra, and Shastras of various fields of knowledge from the early 1st millennium period is of great interest as it helped the emergence of diverse schools and the spread of Indian religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism in and outside South Asia.

The shastras are both descriptive and prescriptive. Among the various Shastras, Manu&#x27;s code of law has been among the most studied as the colonial British government attempted to establish different laws in British India based on Sharia for Muslims and Manu&#x27;s code of law.

The shastras are not consistent or single-consensus documents. Dharma-sastras, for example, contain opposing views and contradictory theories. This is in part because they represent an ideal of human behaviour, while at the same time recognising the need to account for likely failings. The shastras do not present life as it was lived. Rather they reveal an idea of what life should be. The shastra texts constitute one of the great bodies of literature of the ancient world.

==Sutra==

Sutras are another genre of Indian texts that emerged in the 1st millennium BCE, particularly after the 600 BCE. &quot;Sutra&quot; (literally &quot;binding thread&quot;) denotes a type of literary composition distinct from Shastra. In Sanskrit, &quot;sutra&quot; typically referred to one or more aphorisms; hence sutras use short, aphoristic, evocative statements. In contrast, a Shastra is typically longer, with more detail and explanations. An example of a Sutra is Patanjali&#x27;s Yogasutras (considered a classic Hindu treatise), while an example of Shastra is Hemachandra&#x27;s Yogasastra (considered a classic Svetambara Jain treatise), both on yoga.

Shastras and Sutras are among the numerous other genres of literature that have survived from ancient and medieval India. Other genres include Vedas, Upanishads, Vedangas, Itihasa, Puranas, Bhasyas, and Subhashitas.

<doc id="373100" wikidata="Q1974071" url="?curid=373100" title="Needle sharing">
<text>Needle sharing is the practice of intravenous drug-users by which a needle or syringe is shared by multiple individuals to administer intravenous drugs such as heroin, steroids, and hormones. This is a primary vector for blood-borne diseases which can be transmitted through blood (blood-borne pathogens). People who inject drugs (PWID) are at an increased risk for Hepatitis C (HCV) and HIV due to needle sharing practices. From 1933 to 1943, malaria was spread between users in the New York City area by this method. Afterwards, the use of quinine as a cutting agent in drug mixes became more common. Harm reduction efforts including safe disposal of needles, supervised injection sites, and public education may help bring awareness on safer needle sharing practices.

==Infections==
Blood-borne diseases are transmitted when a susceptible person uses a needle that was previously used by a person who is infected with these pathogens; hence, sharing needles with other individuals is not a safe practice. It takes one simple prick of a contaminated needle to put someone at risk of acquiring Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or HIV infections with Hepatitis B being the easiest to contract, followed by Hepatitis C then HIV. People who use previously used needles are at increased risk of getting infected with blood-borne pathogens such as HIV, HBV, and HCV, and spreading the infections to others. In addition to HIV, HBV, and HCV, some sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can be transmitted to uninfected individuals due to the risky injection practices. 

According to CDC, in 2013, sharing syringes was the cause of HIV infection in 3,096 out of the 47,352 patients who were newly diagnosed with the disease in the United States. According to a study done by New Haven Connecticut&#x27;s needle exchange program, 67.5% of the needles returned to the facility were contaminated with HIV. Their assumption was that people bringing in “street needles” were shared among other people prior to bringing them to the program. Almost 50% of people who participate in IVDU have Hepatitis C. Not only are blood borne diseases passed via needle sharing, but so are bacterial infections that can ultimately cause sepsis. Additionally, improper disposal of hospital needles can expose drug resistant organisms to the outside environment.

== Risk factors for needle sharing ==
Much research has been done on risk factors that may predispose an individual to needle sharing in an effort to improve the effectiveness of needle-exchange programs (NEPs) and other harm reduction programs for PWID. The barriers that contribute to rates of needle sharing include the lack of accessibility to clean needles and education about safe needle usage. In each respective country, government and cultural views towards PWID and NEPs have an impact on the resources available as demonstrated by studies done in China, France, Vietnam, and India. Within the United States, needle sharing behavior is positively correlated to individuals who are of lower socioeconomic status, younger than 45 years old, male, and unemployed. The incidence of needle sharing was found to be more prevalent in homosexual and bisexual men compared to women and heterosexual men, particularly in minority communities. People of a minority race or ethnicity are often at an increased risk of needle sharing, possibly due to lower levels of health education.

==Safe disposal of needles==

Discarding needles in regular household trash bins endangers children, pets, janitors, and waste management services personnel; therefore, needles should be properly disposed of in a FDA-cleared sharps container that is both puncture- and leak-resistant. It is important to properly dispose of used needles because it can be difficult to tell if a needle has ever been used before. By not disposing of needles in a safe way, users may expose others or themselves to a needle stick injury. If a sharps container is not available, needles can often be brought to local law enforcement, hospitals, or drug stores for safe collection and disposal. In addition, needles can be mailed in specialized containers to a mail-back program for safe disposal. Moreover, needles can be utilized and disposed of properly in supervised injection sites. In the health care setting, use of blunt-end needles can minimize the risk of needle stick injuries. 

== Harm reduction ==
NEPs, also known as syringe exchange programs (SEPs), are a form of harm reduction policy that provide new needles to persons addicted to drugs in exchange for used ones in order to help control the spread of disease. In the United States, there are three distinct prohibitions on needle exchange programs at the federal level—the Ryan White CARE Act, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) authorization, and the 1997 Labor-Health and Human Services (HHS) Education appropriations legislation. However, many states still provide the service despite the federal legislation, especially in large cities where intravenous drug use is a major health concern. A study in New York State found that during the course of 12 months, NEP prevented roughly 87 infections of HIV by preventing needle sharing. In addition, NEP have decreased the spread of HIV by one third to two fifths.

One of the other harm reduction measurements in this regard is the Supervised Injection Sites, also known as Safe Injection Sites. In these facilities, drug users have access to new needles and they can use substances under the supervision of staff trained to prevent and treat drug overdose and trained to prevent HIV and hepatitis. Some of these sites also provide help to their clients to ease their access to drug treatment and other additional social and medical services. There are some countries around the world that have already established safe injection sites, including Australia and Canada. According to NPR, since the start of this program in Canada in 2013, these sites have supervised over 3.6 million injections and have prevented more than 6,000 overdoses. Additionally, in a cross-sectional survey performed in Glasgow from 1990 to 1996, the incidence of Hepatitis C had significantly decreased with the implementation of safe needle exchanges.

The progression of supervised injection site implementation is currently not widely accepted due to social stigma, lack of government support, and health advocacy. Continued public health education, advocacy efforts, and further research may help encourage the expansion supervised injection sites.

<doc id="373103" wikidata="Q756714" url="?curid=373103" title="Weka">
<text>The weka, also known as the Māori hen or woodhen (Gallirallus australis) is a flightless bird species of the rail family. It is endemic to New Zealand. Some authorities consider it as the only extant member of the genus &quot;Gallirallus&quot;. Four subspecies are recognized but only two (northern/southern) are supported by genetic evidence.

The weka are sturdy brown birds, about the size of a chicken. As omnivores, they feed mainly on invertebrates and fruit. Weka usually lay eggs between August and January; both sexes help to incubate.

==Description==
Weka are large rails. They are predominantly rich brown mottled with black and grey; the brown shade varies from pale to dark depending on subspecies. The male is the larger sex at in length and in weight. Females measure in length and weigh . The reduced wingspan ranges from .

The relatively large, reddish-brown beak is about long, stout and tapered, and used as a weapon. The pointed tail is near-constantly being flicked, a sign of unease characteristic of the rail family. Weka have sturdy legs and reduced wings.

==Taxonomy and distribution==
The common name, &quot;weka&quot;, is a Māori word. The species was named &quot;Rallus australis&quot; by Anders Erikson Sparrman in 1789. Sparrman published the information in &quot;Museum Carlsonianum&quot;, four fascicules based on specimens collected while voyaging with Captain James Cook between 1772 and 1775. &quot;Australis&quot; is Latin for &quot;southern&quot;. Johann Georg Wagler&#x27;s suggestion of the genus &quot;Ocydromus&quot; in 1830 to describe each weka as a species was generally adopted. However, weka were later classified as a single species in the genus &quot;Gallirallus&quot; with four subspecies.

The buff weka (&quot;Gallirallus australis hectori&quot;) formerly inhabited the eastern districts of the South Island but is now confined to Chatham Island and Pitt Island to which it was introduced in the early 1900s, and where they are widely hunted and eaten in the autumn (due to their status as non-native to the islands).

Reintroduction into Canterbury has been unsuccessful so far but introductions to Mou Waho Island (in Lake Wānaka in 2004) and from there to Pigeon and Pig Island (in Lake Wakatipu in 2005/2006) have been much more successful. It has a lighter overall colouring than the other subspecies. The North Island weka (&quot;G. a. greyi&quot;) is represented by original populations in Northland and Poverty Bay, and by liberations elsewhere from that stock. This subspecies differs in its greyer underparts, and brown rather than reddish coloured legs. Individual sightings around the Dunedin area suggest several individuals may exist in the southeastern South Island, either as surreptitious or inadvertent introductions, or possibly as remnants of a population previously thought extinct.

The nominate subspecies, the western weka (&quot;G. a. australis&quot;), is found mainly in the northern and western regions of the South Island from Nelson to Fiordland. Distinguished by dark red-brown and black streaking on the breast, the western weka has two distinct colour phases, that of the southernmost range showing a greater degree of black. The Stewart Island weka (&quot;G. a. scotti&quot;) is smaller than the other subspecies and, like the western weka, has two colour phases; a chestnut form – similar to the chestnut-phase western weka – and a black phase which is not as dark as the black western weka. Reintroduced populations are confined to Stewart Island / Rakiura and outliers, and to Kapiti Island to which it was introduced. Weka are host to two species of feather lice (&quot;Rallicola harrisoni&quot; and &quot;Pseudomenopon pilgrimi&quot;) which show the same north–south population structure seen in their hosts.

==Behaviour==
===Habitat and diet===
Weka occupy areas such as forests, sub-alpine grassland, sand dunes, rocky shores and modified semi-urban environments. They are omnivorous, with a diet comprising 30% animal foods and 70% plant foods. Animal foods include earthworms, larvae, beetles, wētā, ants, grass grubs, slugs, snails, insect eggs, slaters, frogs, spiders, rats, mice, and small birds. Stewart Island weka (&quot;G. a. scotti&quot;) have been observed preying on sooty shearwater (&quot;Puffinus griseus&quot;) eggs and chicks.

Plant foods include leaves, grass, berries and seeds. Weka are important in the bush as seed dispersers, distributing seeds too large for smaller berry-eating birds. Where the weka is relatively common, their furtive curiosity leads them to search around houses and camps for food scraps, or anything unfamiliar and transportable. They have been known to take shiny objects in particular.

===Breeding and Nesting===

The breeding season varies, but when food is plentiful, weka can raise up to four broods throughout the whole year. Nests are made on the ground under the cover of thick vegetation, and built by making grass (or similar material) into a bowl to hold about four eggs. On average, female weka lay three creamy or pinkish eggs blotched with brown and mauve. Both sexes incubate. The chicks hatch after a month, and are fed by both parents until fully grown between six and ten weeks.

==Conservation status==
Weka are classed as a vulnerable species. The Department of Conservation&#x27;s weka recovery plan, approved in 1999, aims to improve the conservation status of threatened weka, clarify the status of data deficient weka, maintain the non-threatened status of other weka, and eventually restore all weka to their traditional ranges as a significant component of the ecosystems.

Weka are problematic in conservation; some subspecies are threatened, but have been a problem to other threatened wildlife on offshore islands, especially when introduced to an island that they would not naturally inhabit. Weka are unable to withstand the current pressures faced in both the North Island and South Island. However, they can be very productive in good conditions and high food availability. Year-round breeding has been recorded at several sites with up to 14 young produced in a year. Weka populations can persist in highly modified habitats, but they have disappeared from huge areas of their former range, suggesting that they can adapt to a wide range of conditions but are particularly vulnerable to threats.

===Threats===
The Department of Conservation identifies eight main threats to weka. Predation by ferrets, cats, and dogs are a threat to adult weka; stoats and ferrets are a threat to chicks; stoats and rats are a threat to eggs. It faces competition with introduced species for fruits and invertebrates, and suffers from the impact browsers have on forest composition and regeneration. Habitat depletion is caused by the modification and degradation of forests and wetlands. Diseases and parasites have been associated with population declines, although little is known. Drought has been implicated in the disappearance of weka from some areas. In some regions, motor vehicles cause a significant amount of roadkill death. Pest control operations sometimes kill weka, as they have ground foraging habits vulnerable to poison baits, and traps are laid in a way that weka can reach. Genetic diversity can be lost during the transmission of genes through generations, affecting isolated populations.

==Human interaction==
Weka are significant to some Māori iwi (tribes) who admire their curiosity and feisty, bold personality traits which have led to them being relatively easy to catch. Weka were used by the Māori as a source of food, perfume, oil to treat inflammations, feathers in clothing and lures to catch dogs. Early European explorers and settlers frequently encountered and utilised weka; they were called &quot;bush hens&quot;.

===Incidents===

In October 2023 a two-person team competing in a reality show were disqualified after one killed and ate a weka in what he claimed was an act of desperation and hunger, despite knowing it was a protected species. They were also issued with a letter of reprimand from the Department of Conservation.

<doc id="373105" wikidata="Q1112579" url="?curid=373105" title="St Bride's Church">
<text>St Bride&#x27;s Church is a Church of England church in Fleet Street in the City of London. Likely dedicated to Saint Bridget perhaps as early as the 6th century, the building&#x27;s most recent incarnation was designed by Sir Christopher Wren in 1672, though Wren&#x27;s original building was largely gutted by fire during the London Blitz in 1940 and then was faithfully reconstructed in the 1950s.

Due to its location in Fleet Street, it has a long association with journalists and newspapers. The church is a distinctive sight on London&#x27;s skyline and is clearly visible from a number of locations. Since 2012 St Bride&#x27;s celebretes usually on first or second Thursday of November the &quot;Journalists’ Commemorative Service&quot;.

With its steeple standing 226 feet (69m) tall, it is the second highest of all Wren&#x27;s church spires, with only St Paul&#x27;s itself having a higher pinnacle.

==Background==

===Origins===

St Bride&#x27;s may be one of the most ancient churches in London, with worship perhaps dating back to the conversion of the Middle Saxons in the 7th century. It is believed that its name is derived from Bridget of Ireland, the patron saint of Ireland. It may have been founded by Irish monks, missionaries proselytising the English. It is believed that the original church, founded around the 6th Century by Irish missionaries, is the only such Celtic Irish founded church in the east of Britain.

The present St Bride&#x27;s is at least the seventh church to have stood on the site. Traditionally, it was founded by St Bridget in the sixth century. Whether or not she founded it personally, the remnants of the first church appear to have significant similarities to a church of the same date in Kildare, Ireland. The Norman church, built in the 11th century, was of both religious and secular significance; in 1210, King John held a parliament there. It was replaced by a larger church in the 15th century,

St Bride&#x27;s association with the newspaper business began in 1500, when Wynkyn de Worde set up a printing press next door. Until 1695, London was the only city in England where printing was permitted by law.

===Roanoke colony===
In the late 1580s, Eleanor White, daughter to artist and explorer John White, was married in St Bride&#x27;s to the tiler and bricklayer Ananias Dare. Their daughter, Virginia Dare, was to be the first English child born in North America. She was born on Roanoke Island on 18 August 1587: &quot;Elenora, daughter to the governour and wife to Ananias Dare, one of the assistants, was delivered of a daughter in Roanoke&quot;. The child was healthy and &quot;was christened there the Sunday following, and because this childe was the first Christian borne in Virginia, she was named Virginia&quot;. A modern bust of Virginia Dare stands near the font (one of the few survivals from the original church) replacing an earlier monument which was stolen and has not been recovered.

===Great Fire of London===

In the mid-17th century disaster struck. In 1665, the Great Plague of London killed 238 parishioners in a single week, and in 1666, the following year, the church was completely destroyed during the Great Fire of London, which burned much of the city. After the fire, the old church was replaced by an entirely new building designed by Sir Christopher Wren, one of his largest and most expensive works, taking seven years to build.

St Bride&#x27;s was reopened on 19 December 1675. The famous spire was added later, in 1701–1703. It originally measured 234 ft, but lost its upper eight feet to a lightning strike in 1764; this was then bought by the then owner of Park Place, Berkshire, where it still resides. The design utilises four octagonal stages of diminishing height, capped with an obelisk which terminates in a ball and vane.

Buried at St Bride&#x27;s is Robert Levet (Levett), a Yorkshireman who became a Parisian waiter, then a &quot;practicer of physick&quot; who ministered to the denizens of London&#x27;s seedier neighbourhoods. Having been duped into a bad marriage, the hapless Levet was taken in by the author Samuel Johnson who wrote his poem &quot;On the Death of Mr. Robert Levet&quot;, eulogising his good friend and tenant of many years. Also buried at St Bride&#x27;s are the composer Sir William Leighton (d. 1622), organist and composer Thomas Weelkes (d. 1623) and the poet Richard Lovelace (d. 1658), as well as author Samuel Richardson (d. 1761)

The wedding cake is said to date back to 1703 when Thomas Rich, a baker&#x27;s apprentice from Ludgate Hill, fell in love with the daughter of his employer and asked her to marry him. He wanted to make an extravagant cake, and drew on the design of St Bride&#x27;s Church for inspiration.

===Second World War===
On the night of 29 December 1940, during the Blitz of central London in the Second World War, the church was gutted by fire-bombs dropped by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. That night 1,500 fires were started, including three major conflagrations, leading to a fire storm, an event dubbed the &quot;Second Great Fire of London&quot;, due to the enormous amount of damage caused. St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral itself was only saved by the dedication of the London firemen who kept the fire away from the cathedral and the volunteer firewatchers of the St Paul&#x27;s Watch who fought to keep the flames from firebombs on the roof from spreading. After the war, St Bride&#x27;s was rebuilt at the expense of newspaper proprietors and journalists.

One fortunate and unintended consequence of the bombing was the excavation of the church&#x27;s original 6th century Saxon foundations. Today, the crypt known as the Museum of Fleet Street is open to the public and contains a number of ancient relics, including Roman coins and medieval stained glass.
Post-war excavations also uncovered nearly 230 lead coffins with plaques dating from the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries, filled with the bones of parishioners; causes of death for most of them were found by the Museum of London.

==Modern era==
The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.

In September 2007 the former rector, Archdeacon the Venerable David Meara, announced a special appeal to raise £3.5 million to preserve the church&#x27;s unique heritage and in November 2007 Queen Elizabeth II was guest of honour at a service to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the restoration work necessary after the Second World War.

In March 2012, the &quot;Inspire!&quot; appeal was launched to raise the at least £2.5m needed to repair the crumbling stonework of the church&#x27;s famous spire.

In March 2016 the wedding of Jerry Hall and Rupert Murdoch was celebrated at St Bride&#x27;s.

== Music ==

=== Choir ===
The choir in its present form (12 adult singers – 4 sopranos, 2 altos, 3 tenors and 3 basses) was established in time for the re-dedication service in 1957, and has remained more or less in this format ever since. The choir sings at two services each Sunday throughout the year (reducing to 8 singers during August) and also for numerous special services. The Director of Music is Robert Jones, and the Assistant Director of Music is Matthew Morley.

=== Organ ===
The organ was built by the John Compton Organ Company, and is arguably their finest work. It was ready for the rededication of the church in November 1957. It has recently been completely overhauled and cleaned by Keith Bance, who has carried out some modest tonal updating. This included remodelling the positive division, adding new mixture stops to the great and pedal divisions and the provision of a new Vox Humana for the solo division. These changes have further increased the resources of an already versatile instrument. The organ has four manuals, 98 speaking stops, close to 4,000 pipes, a multi-level capture system and the wind is provided by four blowing installations.

====Organists====

* Henry Lightindollar 1696–1702
* John Weldon 1702–1736
* Samuel Howard 1736–1782
* Richard Huddleston Potter 1782–1821
* George Mather 1821–1854
* Mr. Reynolds, from 1854
* Ernest Kiver, from 1882
* John D. Codner, until 1888 (later organist of St Davids Cathedral)
* Edmund Hart Turpin 1888–1907
* Herbert Townsend 1909–ca. 1921
* Gordon Reynolds 1952–1965
* Robert Langston 1972–1988
* Robert Harre-Jones, from 1988

=== Bells ===
St Bride&#x27;s Church is noted as the site of the first ever full peal on twelve bells (5060 Grandsire Cinques), and is considered to be one of the first towers which had a diatonic ring of twelve bells. Ten bells were cast for the church in 1710 by Abraham Rudhall of Gloucester, and were augmented to twelve in 1719 with the addition of two trebles. The 5th and 6th bells were recast by Samuel Knight of Holborn in 1736.

All of the bells were destroyed on 29 December 1940 during the Blitz. After the war, a single bell cast by John Taylor &amp; Co was placed in the tower, hung for full-circle ringing, but was never joined by any other bells. During the installation, the church and foundry made sure that it was sympathetic to a future 12-bell installation. It weighs 15 hundredweight in the key of F♯, and would be the 10th of a new ring of 12 in D.

==Notable parishioners==

St Bride&#x27;s has had a number of notable parishioners, including John Milton, John Dryden, and the diarist Samuel Pepys, who was baptized in the church. Pepys buried his brother Tom in the church in 1664, but by this stage the vaults were so overcrowded that Pepys had to bribe the gravedigger to &quot;justle together&quot; the corpses in order to make room. In 2009, Sir Clement Freud&#x27;s funeral was held in the church.

==Notable burials in the churchyard==
* Roger Giffard, physician
* Richard Lovelace, poet
* Denis Papin, steam engine pioneer
* Thomas Pellett, physician
* Samuel Richardson, novelist
* Thomas Weelkes, composer
* William Charles Wells, physician, formulated early ideas of natural selection

<doc id="373108" wikidata="Q1076032" url="?curid=373108" title="Mithila (proposed Indian state)">
<text>Mithila is a proposed state in India, comprising the Maithili speaking region of Bihar and Jharkhand. The Maithili language has own traditional script, known as Mithilakshar. It is part of the historical Mithila region.
The proposed state will also include Whole Angika and Bajjika speaking districts which are considered to be dialects of Maithili.

There was also a movement in the Maithili speaking areas of Nepal for a separate state which ended in 2015, after Constitution of Nepal (2015) ensured it in form of province two.

==History==

Dr Laksman Jha and Others demanded a Mithila state shortly after independence and the former Chief Minister of Bihar, Jagannath Mishra has also expressed support for the creation of the state.

Various organisations have been formed that demand the formation of a state including the Maithil Mahasabha and the Mithilanchal Vikash Congress the former received support from Raj Darbhanga.
Various demonstrations have taken place demanding a Mithila state with a major protest taking place in Delhi in 2009 organised by the Akhil Bharatiya Mithila Rajya Sangharsh Samiti.

==Political support==
===Mithila Rajya Nirman Sena===

* Senior BJP leader, Rangnath Thakur, chairman and Founding member of Mithila Rajya Nirman Sena, has organised public rallies supporting Mithila.
Mithila Rajya Nirman Sena also did a Sankalp yatra under his leadership in 2017 and 2021 to create awareness and support for the movement

===Bharatiya Janata Party===

* Former BJP MP Kirti Azad from Darbhanga (Current Congress leader) has organised multiple dharnas and protests in support of Mithila. He has also launched a signature campaign in Mithila aiming to raise awareness.
* Senior BJP leader, Tarakant Jha, former chairman of Bihar Legislative Council, has organised public rallies supporting Mithila.

===Janata Dal (United)===

* In November 2011, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar also extended his support for the statehood of Mithila.
* Shravan Chaudhary, JDU state president, has openly supported the demand for the statehood of Mithila.

===Rashtriya Janata Dal===

*Rabri Devi, former CM of Bihar, has always favoured the creation of a separate Mithila state.

==Justification for Separation ==

The demand for separate Mithila state has been there since creation of State of Bihar in 1912. 
*The problems of Mithila region are different from rest of Bihar.
*Maithili the language of the region has not been properly recognised. The 8th schedule of the Constitution of India includes the recognition of the 22 languages including Maithili (but in Devanagari Script). In Bihar Maithili is yet receive any official status.

==Challenges==

Mithila is a poor and flood-prone region dependent on subsistence agriculture, leading to doubts over its economically feasibility as a separate state.

<doc id="373115" wikidata="Q3518451" url="?curid=373115" title="Shatrughna">
<text>Shatrughna (, ), also known as Ripudaman, is the younger brother of Rama, and King of Madhupura and Vidisha, in the Hindu epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;. He is considered as an incarnation of the Sudarshana Chakra of god Vishnu, and was married to Shrutakirti.

Shatrughna is the twin of Lakshmana. He is a loyalist of Bharata, just like Lakshmana is to Rama. Shatrughna appears as the 412th name of Vishnu in the &quot;Vishnu Sahasranama&quot; of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The name Shatrughna is of Sanskrit origin. &quot;Shatru&quot; means &#x27;enemy&#x27; and &quot;Ghna&quot; means &#x27;kill&#x27;. His name means &#x27;killer of enemies&#x27;.

== Legend ==
===Birth and early life===
King Dasharatha of Ayodhya had three wives: Kausalya, Kaikeyi, and Sumitra. Shatrughan and his elder brother Lakshmana were born to Sumitra, while Rama and Bharata were born to Kausalya and Kaikeyi. In the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, he is described as an incarnation of Sudarshana Chakra.

===Marriage to Shrutakirti===
After Rama won the svayamvara of Sita, their marriage was fixed. King Dasharatha arrived in Mithila for his son&#x27;s wedding and noticed that Lakshmana had feelings for Urmila, but according to tradition, Bharata and Mandavi were to marry first. King Dasharatha then arranged for Bharata to marry Mandavi and Shatrughna to marry Shrutakirti, allowing Lakshmana to marry Urmila. Ultimately, all four sisters married the four brothers, strengthening the alliance between the two kingdoms. Shatrughna and Shrutakirti had two sons named Subahu and Shatrughati.

===Rama&#x27;s exile===
When Rama was exiled, Shatrughna dragged Kaikeyi&#x27;s old nurse Manthara (who was responsible for poisoning the queen&#x27;s mind against Rama) and tried to kill her, but he was restrained by Bharata, who felt that Rama would not approve. Bharata went to Rama and asked him to come back to Ayodhya, but Rama refused. Bharata ruled Ayodhya from Nandigram and was an excellent leader, acting as the very embodiment of dharma. Although Bharata was the king designate of Ayodhya during Rama&#x27;s exile, it was Shatrughna who undertook of the administration of the whole kingdom during Rama&#x27;s absence. Shatrughna was the only solace for the three queen mothers during the absence of Rama, Lakshmana, and Bharata from Ayodhya.

===Rage against Manthara===
Manthara appears only once in the &quot;Ramayana&quot; after Rama&#x27;s banishment. Having been rewarded by Kaikeyi with costly clothing and jewels, she was walking in the palace gardens when Bharata and his half-brother Shatrughna came upon her. Seeing her, Shatrughna flew into a violent rage over Rama&#x27;s banishment decided to attack her. Kaikeyi begged Bharata to save her, which he did, telling Shatrughna that it would be a sin to kill a woman, and that Rama would be furious with both of them if he did such a thing. He relented and the brothers left, while Kaikeyi attempted to comfort Manthara.

===Slaying of Lavanasura===
Although he played a relatively minor role in the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, Shatrughna was important to the main story and goal of the epic. His chief exploit was the killing of Lavanasura, the demon King of Madhupura (Mathura), who was a nephew of Ravana, the King of Lanka, slain by Rama.

Lavanasura was the son of Madhu, the pious demon-king after whom the city of Madhupura was named. Madhu&#x27;s wife and Lavanusara&#x27;s mother Kumbhini was a sister of Ravana. Lavanasura was holder of the divine &quot;Trishula&quot; (Trident) of Lord Shiva, and nobody was able to kill him or prevent him from committing sinful activities.

Shatrughna requested Rama and his elder brothers to allow him the opportunity to serve them by killing Lavanasura. Shatrughna killed the demon with an arrow imbibed with the power of Vishnu. After Lavanasura&#x27;s death, Rama crowned him King of Madhupura.

===Death===
Shatrughna divided his kingdom consisting of Madhupura and Vidisha between his sons Subahu and Shatrughati. After Rama, the seventh Avatar of Vishnu completed 11,000 years of perfectly pious rule upon earth, walked into the river Sarayu to return to his true and eternal Mahavishnu form, Bharata and Shatrughna also followed him into the river and later merged into Mahavishnu.

==Assessment==
Shatrughna was the youngest of the fourth brothers. He dedicated himself in the service of his brother, Bharata. When Bharata, decided to stay at Nandigram, Shatrughan wanted to accompany him. But on his brother&#x27;s request, he stayed in Ayodhya and looked after the state as an administrator. Shatrughan also looked after all his three mothers.

==Worship==
In the Medak district of Telangana, there is a temple called Sri Kalyana Ramachandra Sannadhi that is dedicated to Shatrughna and Shrutakirti. This temple is the only one in India that has installed statues of Rama&#x27;s brothers and their wives.

<text>Gargoyles (also known as Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles for season 3) is an animated television series co-produced by Walt Disney Television Animation, Walt Disney Animation Japan for its first two seasons and Nelvana Limited for its final, and originally aired from October 24, 1994, to February 15, 1997. The series features a species of nocturnal creatures known as gargoyles that turn to stone during the day. After spending a thousand years in an enchanted petrified state, the gargoyles (who have been transported from medieval Scotland) are reawakened in modern-day New York City, and take on roles as the city&#x27;s secret night-time protectors.

&quot;Gargoyles&quot; was noted for its relatively dark tone, complex story arcs, and melodrama; character arcs were heavily employed throughout the series, as were Shakespearean themes. The series also received favorable comparisons to &quot;Cybersix&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;X-Men&quot;. A video game adaptation and a spin-off comic series were released in 1995. The show&#x27;s storyline continued from 2006 to 2009 in a comic book series of the same title, produced by Slave Labor Graphics, and was again revived by Dynamite Entertainment in 2022. In 2023, a live-action reboot for Disney+ was announced, to be produced by Atomic Monster.

==Premise==
The series features a species of nocturnal creatures known as gargoyles that turn to stone during the day, focusing on a clan led by Goliath. In 994, the clan lives in a castle in Scotland. Most are betrayed and killed by humans while petrified and the remainder are magically cursed to sleep—i.e., be frozen in stone form until the castle &quot;rises above the clouds.&quot; A thousand years later in 1994, billionaire David Xanatos purchases the gargoyles&#x27; castle and has it reconstructed atop his New York skyscraper, the Eyrie Building, thus awakening Goliath and the remainder of his clan. While trying to adjust to their new world, they are aided by a sympathetic police officer named Elisa Maza and quickly come into conflict with the plotting Xanatos. In addition to dealing with the gargoyles&#x27; attempts to adjust to modern New York City, the series also incorporated various supernatural threats to their safety and to the world at large.

==Episodes==
A total of 78 half-hour episodes were produced.

The first two seasons aired in the Disney Afternoon programming block. The first season consisted of 13 episodes, including a five-part opening story. This season&#x27;s episodes were almost entirely written by Michael Reaves and Brynne Chandler Reaves. The second season featured 52 episodes, and a long mid-season story arc dubbed by fans as &quot;The Gargoyles World Tour&quot; in which four of the main characters travel the world, encountering other Gargoyles and confronting various mystical and science-fictional dangers. The writing staff was greatly expanded for season two.

Following Disney&#x27;s purchase of ABC in 1996, the third and final season aired during Saturday mornings on ABC as &quot;Gargoyles: The Goliath Chronicles&quot;. Behind the scenes, the animation producers and writers had almost completely changed from seasons one and two, while on-screen, the Gargoyles&#x27; relationship to the world changed considerably.

==Voice cast==
Thom Adcox-Hernandez, Ed Asner, Jeff Bennett, Keith David, Bill Fagerbakke, and Salli Richardson voiced the main characters, and appeared in a majority of episodes.

The voice cast featured many alumni of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, including Marina Sirtis and Jonathan Frakes, who were featured regularly as principal cast members. Many other &quot;Star Trek&quot; actors had recurring roles or made guest appearances.

==Development==
The series bears no creator credit, though there were several people who are responsible for the show&#x27;s format. Michael Reaves, who wrote the first six episodes and was the primary writer/story editor of the show&#x27;s first two seasons has described himself with respect to &quot;Gargoyles&quot; as &quot;in on the ground floor [of] creating something iconic&quot;. Greg Weisman also describes himself as one of the creators of &quot;Gargoyles&quot; having included much of the folkloric, mythological, and historical elements.

The series&#x27; first season was almost entirely written by the husband-and-wife team of Michael Reaves and Brynne Chandler Reaves, who wrote 12 of the 13 episodes; the remaining episode was written by Steve Perry. All three writers were just coming off having written extensively for &quot;&quot; (for which Reaves won an Emmy, and Chandler Reaves an Emmy nomination). Weisman officially joined the series as a co-producer with episode 6 (though he also oversaw earlier episodes in his capacity as a Disney executive), and did not have any writing credits on the show until the third season.

The first season was developed on a sliding schedule; each phase of developing the thirteen episodes, such as writing, storyboarding, and animating, was given a ten-month period, with significant overlap. After they had delivered the first thirteen episodes, the production team asked Buena Vista Television to pick up a second season with another thirteen; the show had not yet aired, but Buena Vista agreed for them to start work on six more episodes. Once the show started its weekly syndication run in 1994, it was quickly seen as successful both as a television program and for promoting toy sales, and Buena Vista pushed the show&#x27;s team to make the second season 52 episodes so that they could run it daily starting in the 1995 television season. Weisman stated they were not prepared for this given their production methods and the lack of timing to get those episodes ready for a fall 1995 premiere, despite telling Buena Vista this several times. When Disney refused to back down from the 52-episode order, the team decided to expand fourfold to handle the additional episodes. The writing staff grew to include Reaves, Chandler Reaves, and Perry, as well as newcomers Lydia Marano, Cary Bates, Gary Sperling, Adam Gilad, Diane Duane and Peter Morwood, amongst others. For this season, story editing duties were handled on a rotating basis by Reaves, Chandler Reaves, Bates, and Sperling. Storylines expanded beyond the Manhattan setting and more characters were added to help create stories to fill the episode count. Weisman said that he had discussions with Michael Eisner of using &quot;Gargoyles&quot; as a starting point for an action-oriented universe within Disney, comparing this to how Warner Bros. owned DC Comics, and some second season episodes were used to set up potential hooks for these.

The second season finished with a definitive wrap-up story told over a series of final episodes. However, a third season was unexpectedly ordered—although the series order was reduced to thirteen episodes and moved to a Saturday morning slot. Around this point, Reaves, Chandler Reaves, Perry, and Sperling all left the show. Meanwhile, the reduced episode order was a result of two factors according to Weisman. The first was changes within Disney itself. The fallout from the death of Disney president Frank Wells led to the divide between Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Katzenberg left to form DreamWorks. Weisman&#x27;s bosses, Gary Krisel and Bruce Cranston, who had been supportive of &quot;Gargoyles&quot;, also left with Katzenberg for Dreamworks. Further, internal pressure on Eisner from Roy E. Disney forced him to treat &quot;Gargoyles&quot; as part of the studio&#x27;s older works, thus dropping the larger action universe plans, and leaving the show without any support. Secondly, as the second season aired, the highly-publicized trial of O. J. Simpson drew audiences away from &quot;Gargoyles&quot; often due to preemption from the trial&#x27;s coverage. By the time the trial was over, &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; had become more powerful as a brand. At this point, the show staff did not think they were likely to get a third season (which is one reason why much of the writing staff moved on), but as Disney had just bought Capital Cities, the owners of the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) network, they needed programming for its Saturday morning block. They therefore had the mostly new &quot;Gargoyles&quot; team develop thirteen more episodes for it, now calling the series &quot;The Goliath Chronicles&quot;. Returning writers included Marano, Bates, and Gilad; Weisman also made his debut as a writer with the season opener. Because the series was on broadcast stations rather than syndication, the show had to meet different Broadcast Standards and Practices which Weisman stated drastically limited his creativity. While he wrote the first episode and spoke of his concerns to Disney, Weisman has contended Disney had removed him from the team and assigned the rest of the show&#x27;s run to Nelvana.

Many Shakespearean characters and stories found their way into the show&#x27;s storylines, particularly those from &quot;Macbeth&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. The series was also influenced by medieval Scottish history, as well as television shows ranging from &quot;Disney&#x27;s Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot;, to &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; as well as &quot;Bonkers&quot; (in which Weisman himself co-produced). The latter in particular inspired the ensemble format of the series and the 30-second &quot;Previously, on &quot;Gargoyles&quot;...&quot; recap found at the beginning of later episodes. The former was an influence on the original comedy development of the show, which was subsequently made darker and more serious by first season writers Reaves, Chandler Reaves and Perry.

New York artist Joe Tomasini brought a suit against Disney, claiming that his copyrighted screenplay and character designs had been copied during the development and production of &quot;Gargoyles&quot;. The case was ultimately thrown out, after it was proven that Disney did not have access to Tomasini&#x27;s creations.

In May 2020, Weisman said in an interview, &quot;&quot;Gargoyles&quot; is still my baby. I don&#x27;t own it. I don&#x27;t get a dime off of it being on Disney Plus. And yet I&#x27;m so thrilled that it is, I&#x27;m thrilled that it represents a chance — even if it&#x27;s a slim chance — to bring it back. I&#x27;ve always wanted to do more. I&#x27;ve got a timeline for the show that&#x27;s 315 pages long. I&#x27;ve got notebooks and comp books full of ideas for it. Spin-off notions and all sorts of things. Literally, nothing would make me happier than to go back and do more &quot;Gargoyles&quot;.&quot;

==Broadcast history==
The first two seasons of &quot;Gargoyles&quot; aired in the Republic of Ireland on RTE Two on weekday afternoons from January 6 to April 1997.

In the United States, the series first reran on the USA Network, as part of their morning &quot;Action Extreme Team&quot; block. It later moved to Toon Disney (and later onto Jetix&#x27;s lineup) and its successor Disney XD where it aired until 2012. ABC Family also aired the show for a brief time in 2004 as part of its weekday morning Jetix block.

==Home media==
===VHS and Laserdisc===
The five-episode pilot &quot;Awakening&quot;, edited into a single movie under the title &quot;Gargoyles the Movie: The Heroes Awaken&quot;, was released on VHS and Laserdisc on January 31, 1995, by Buena Vista Home Video.

===DVD releases===
On June 25, 2013, Volume Two of Season Two was released.

===Streaming===
On October 14, 2019, it was confirmed that all 3 seasons of &quot;Gargoyles&quot; would be available for streaming on the Disney+ streaming service, in which the entire series has been available on there ever since its November 12, 2019 launch.

==Reception==
Since its debut in 1994, &quot;Gargoyles&quot; has become critically acclaimed by fans and critics alike for its heavy focus on fairytales, folktales, comparative religion and mythology. IGN ranked &quot;Gargoyles&quot; 45th place on its 2009 list of top 100 animated series, stating: &quot;A decent success at the time, &quot;Gargoyles&quot; has maintained a strong cult following since it ended more than a decade ago&quot;. Hollywood.com featured it on their 2010 list of six cartoons that should be movies. UGO.com included it on their 2011 top list of legendary medieval and fantasy TV shows. Doug Walker, also known as the Nostalgia Critic, praised the show: &quot;But in secret, I would be watching every one of them, because it was just that good. I don&#x27;t know if it really changed anything in terms of kids&#x27; shows like &quot;&quot; or &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, but it was certainly a welcome detour from what Disney usually did. It really stood on its own and created some really wonderful and really unique stories. &quot;Gargoyles&quot; is a blast from the past that is sure to live on in the future.&quot; Craig Tomashoff, of People Magazine, said &quot;All the traditional, wholesome Disney elements are in place, from a Beauty and the Beast-like plot line to the gargoyles&#x27; old-fashioned sense of nobility and morality. The result is a show that isn&#x27;t bad, with impressive animation.&quot; Elizabeth Rayne of SyFy praised the series, stating &quot;Gargoyles isn&#x27;t just a Gothic fairy tale. There is hidden magic where you&#x27;d least expect it to lurk in that crumbling castle and, later, the clock tower they stand sentinel at night after night, watching over the city that never sleeps… the rock-solid message about friendship and loyalty embedded into every episode is something… [And] you can&#x27;t leave the warped humor of this series in the dark, either.&quot; The show&#x27;s first season holds a rare 100% rating on the film critic site Rotten Tomatoes. Less favorable assessments of the series came from animation producer Bruce Timm, who dismissed &quot;Gargoyles&quot; as &quot;kind of namby-pamby... with all that Celtic fantasy crap&quot; in a 1999 interview and the animation blog Cartoon Brew, which cited the series as an example of the sort of &quot;juvenile mediocrities&quot; that are beloved by the nerd community.

==Film adaptation==
A traditionally animated film adaptation had been discussed by Disney since the beginning of the show&#x27;s run. Todd Garner was the executive producer on a proposed project; having admired the series. Rick Baker was hired to create concept art for the characters and even made a maquette. Greg Weisman and Michael Reaves wrote a draft that adapted the five-part &quot;Awakening&quot; pilot, but it was rejected. Disney regular Jim Kouf was hired to pen a new draft that established Goliath as a Gaelic warrior named Goliath MacGrath who makes a deal with a good sorcerer to battle an evil one named Morgan. However, he and his men are cursed to &quot;give up [their] flesh and blood and [their] heart will be turned to stone&quot; and are promptly turned into gargoyles and turn to stone upon defeating Morgan. In modern day, the focus shifts to Alex Anderson, described as &quot;Goliath&#x27;s long-lost relative&quot;, who returns to New York City following the death of his father. He teams up with Detective Brenna, who is a stand-in for Elisa Maza, and meets the Gargoyles who must battle a revived Morgan. While Disney favored the script, the project was abandoned as it would have been expensive to produce and because the series had ended its run.

In July 2011, David Elliot and Paul Lovett of &quot;G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra&quot; were hired to pen a film adaptation of &quot;Gargoyles&quot;. In June 2018, Jordan Peele pitched his own film version to Disney, but it was supposed to be picked up sooner or later.

==Reboot==
In October 2023, it was announced that a reboot is in development for Disney+. The series will be produced by James Wan through his Atomic Monster label with Gary Dauberman acting as showrunner.

==Merchandise==
Various merchandise released for the series included a series of 22 five-inch action figures (along with two vehicles and a castle playset) released by Kenner in 1995. A collectible card game, &quot;Gargoyles Stone Warriors Battle Card Game&quot;, was published by Parker Brothers in 1994. Other licensed merchandise included numerous other toys and figures, collectible trading card and sticker series, and a wide range of clothing items, books, art supplies, kitchen and bathroom items and supplies, clocks and watches, etc. A world based on the television series was initially considered for &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, but the idea was scrapped.

In 2018, various Funko Pop Vinyl figurines was released. In August 2021, Ravensburger released the &quot;Disney Gargoyles: Awakening&quot; board game. Starting in 2021, NECA began producing &quot;Gargoyles&quot;-based merchandise, such a plush toys and figures of the characters. Quantum Mechanix also produced a line of Q-Fig statues of the &quot;Gargoyles&quot; characters, starting with Goliath and Demona in January 2021.

===Comics===
====Disney Adventures and TV Guide====
Eleven Gargoyles comic stories were created for the Disney Adventures magazine, first appearing in the November 1994 issue, with the final story being printed in the January 1997 issue. The editor of the comics was Heidi MacDonald, who was put in charge of the production of these comics. Greg Weisman had some involvement with the comic, with Heidi recalling a two-hour story conference with him. He would corroborate this, stating, &quot;I was involved. Just not on level of my SLG involvement.&quot;

Heidi would write one comic herself, &quot;The Experts&quot;, and would also write a short Gargoyles comic for the October 19–25, 1996 issue of TV Guide, entitled &quot;Be Afraid of the Dark&quot;.

====Marvel====
Eleven issues were produced under Marvel and released between February 1995 and December 1995. The series was canceled due to low sales and the overall plot is left unconcluded. Weisman was eventually hired to write for the comic, but Marvel cut the deal with Disney before his run could be produced. Weisman still had his unpublished script for the comic and would eventually use it as issue #6 of the &quot;Gargoyles: Clan-Building&quot; SLG comic series. As of July 24, 2022, Dynamite Entertainment planned to republish these comics &quot;at a later date.&quot;

====Olé! Disney====
In the thirteenth issue of the Spanish Disney comic series &quot;Olé! Disney&quot;, a 44-page comic adaptation of the film compilation of the first five episodes &quot;Heroes Awaken!&quot;, entitled &quot;Gargoyles: Héroes Mitológicos&quot;, was produced. It was written by Regis Maine, illustrated by Jesús Redondo, and colored by Jean-Jacques Chagnaud. It was released in 1996. It would also be released in French and German, though no English release was ever made.

====Slave Labor Graphics====

On June 21, 2006, Slave Labor Graphics, in association with CreatureComics, began producing a new &quot;Gargoyles&quot; comic written by Greg Weisman. Weisman wrote the comic book series as a direct sequel to the first and second seasons, ignoring the third season and telling his preferred story in its place. The first two issues are an adaptation of Weisman&#x27;s script of the first episode of The Goliath Chronicles named &quot;The Journey&quot; serving as the only link to that show.

In August 2008, Greg Weisman announced that, due to Disney increasing its licensing fees, Slave Labor Graphics would not be renewing its license of Gargoyles after it ran out on August 31, 2008. The final two issues of &quot;Bad Guys&quot; and four of &quot;Gargoyles&quot; were released in the comic trades collecting both series in August 2009. Weisman also stated that SLG president Dan Vado had not given up on the &quot;Gargoyles&quot; franchise and hoped to pursue the idea of &quot;Gargoyles&quot; graphic novels in the future. As of July 24, 2022, Dynamite Entertainment planned to republish these comics &quot;at a later date.&quot;

====Joe Books====
On December 24, 2015, Aaron Sparrow revealed that &quot;Gargoyles&quot; was to be adapted into a cinestory comics series published by Joe Books Inc. Originally, the first volume was intended to be released on March 30, 2016, adapting the five-part &quot;Awakening&quot; episodes from the first season, and second volume would have adapted the next four episodes (&quot;The Thrill of the Hunt&quot;, &quot;Temptation&quot;, &quot;Deadly Force&quot;, and &quot;Enter MacBeth&quot;) following the pilot. However, on September 29, 2017, Joe Books Inc. confirmed that the cinestory has been cancelled.

====Dynamite Entertainment====
On July 22, 2022, a new ongoing &quot;Gargoyles&quot; comic written by Greg Weisman was announced that would be published by Dynamite Entertainment and depict &quot;Season 4&quot; of the TV series. The 18 issues produced under Slave Labor Graphics remain as the canonical third season instead of &quot;The Goliath Chronicles&quot;. On October 29, 2022, Dynamite Entertainment announced they received 100,000 pre-orders of the first issue, making it Dynamite&#x27;s highest selling comic of the year. A one-shot Halloween special focusing on Brooklyn&#x27;s son, Nashville, was released in October of 2023.

On April 20, 2023, Dynamite Entertainment announced that a spin-off title, &quot;Gargoyles: Dark Ages&quot;, had been green-lit. It was released in July 2023. &quot;Gargoyles: Dark Ages&quot; is set in the year 971, during the era when Hudson is still the leader of the Wyvern clan, depicting events that will lead to alliance between gargoyles and humans as they work together to repel impending dark forces. The comic is written by Greg Weisman and illustrated by Drew Moss.

On October 9, 2023, Dynamite Entertainment announced that the comics had been green lit for a continuation under the title of &quot;Gargoyles: Quest&quot;, for release in January 2024.

==Cultural impact==
===Fan community===
In 1997, Weisman began answering fan questions about the series in an online forum at Ask Greg, revealing, among other things, productions details about the series, in-universe details about the characters, and his plans for the property if it had not been cancelled or if he was able to revive it in the future. Among other revelations, Weisman has detailed spinoffs for the series that reached various stages of development, including &quot;Bad Guys&quot; (for which a leica reel and comics were produced), &quot;Gargoyles 2198&quot;, &quot;Timedancer&quot;, &quot;Pendragon&quot;, &quot;Dark Ages&quot; and &quot;The New Olympians&quot;.

====Conventions====
The Gathering of the Gargoyles was an annual fan convention which began in 1997 and ended in 2009. The Gathering featured several regular guests close to the &quot;Gargoyles&quot; franchise including Greg Weisman and voice actors Keith David and Thom Adcox. The Gathering has featured several recurring special events such as a radio play where attendees audition and take speaking roles, a masquerade ball where attendees dress up as their favorite character, an art show where the many artists within the fandom can display or sell their artwork. Weisman has in the past shown the leica reel of &quot;Bad Guys&quot; at Gatherings. Footage and interviews from the 2004 Gathering appear as an extra feature on the Season 1 DVD of the show.

CONvergence 2014 featured a &quot;Gargoyles&quot; related theme with many guests from the series including Greg Weisman, Thom Adcox, Marina Sirtis, C. Robert Cargill, Scott Lynch, Amy Berg, and Emma Bull. It is a four-day convention held in Bloomington, Minnesota over the Fourth of July weekend. It was done to celebrate the series&#x27; 20th anniversary.

===References in other works===
As a nod to members of the voice cast who worked on both series, the 2001 Pioneer LDC English dub of the anime &quot;3×3 Eyes&quot; contains &quot;Gargoyles&quot; homage scenes. These include a homeless man humming the &quot;Gargoyles&quot; theme and a character who wonders &quot;What could make claw marks in solid stone?&quot; Shared actors included Brigitte Bako, Bill Fagerbakke, Thom Adcox-Hernandez, Keith David and Ed Asner.

The series finale of the 2017 &quot;DuckTales&quot; animated series, &quot;The Last Adventure!&quot;, features an extended &quot;Gargoyles&quot; homage. During a battle, the character Manny the Headless Man-Horse is briefly turned to stone before transforming into his &quot;true form&quot;, which heavily resembles a gargoyle. The sequence is accompanied by an excerpt from the &quot;Gargoyles&quot; theme tune, and Manny quotes Goliath&#x27;s &quot;I live again!&quot; during his transformation, with Keith David providing his voice.

A drawing of Goliath made a cameo in the &quot;Amphibia&quot; episode &quot;True Colors&quot;, which features David as the voice of King Andrias. Creator Matt Braly, who has expressed his love for &quot;Gargoyles&quot;, said the cameo was added in hopes of starting speculations of a multiverse of Disney Television Animation series, as the series is set in multiple universes. He also cited &quot;Gargoyles&quot; as an influence on &quot;Amphibia&quot;″s overarching story and voice work.

<doc id="373117" wikidata="Q12923736" url="?curid=373117" title="Svayamvara">
<text>Svayaṃvara ( ) is a matrimonial tradition in ancient Indian society where a bride, usually from &quot;Kṣatriya&quot; (warrior) caste, selects her husband from a group of assembled suitors either by her own choice or a public contest between her suitors. This practice is mainly featured in the two major Sanskrit epics, the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; and the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot;, though its prevalence and portrayal vary significantly between them.

Origins of &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; can be traced back to the Vedic period and few scholars suggest that it emerged from the &quot;Gāndharva&quot; marriage tradition, diverging from more ritualistic and arranged forms of marriage, and developed as a narrative device within the epics to highlight the heroism and valor of protagonists, aligning with the &quot;Kṣatriya&quot; ethos of competition and martial prowess. Despite being closely associated with the epics, &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; is not listed as a form of marriage in the &quot;Dharmaśāstra&quot;, a collection of Sanskrit texts on law and conduct. Due to this, &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; is sometimes regarded as the ninth form of Hindu marriage.

==Name==
The term &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; is derived from Sanskrit, where it is composed of two parts: &quot;s&quot;vayam&quot;&quot; (स्वयम्) meaning &quot;self&quot; and &quot;v&quot;ara&quot;&quot; (वर) meaning &quot;choice&quot; or &quot;desire.&quot; Therefore, the term literally translates to &quot;self-choice&quot;.

The term &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; specifically refers to the formal ceremony of selecting a groom in the Sanskrit epics. It&#x27;s important to note that in certain significant instances where the bride chooses a husband independently, without a formal ceremony, the term &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; is not used—such as in the case of Sāvitrī choosing Satyavan. The term appears 52 times in the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; and only 6 times in the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot;. The term is predominantly used in the &quot;Ādiparvan&quot; of the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; and the &quot;Araṇyakāṇḍa&quot; of the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot;, both of which experienced substantial expansion during the later epic phase. Thus, according to John L Brockington, &quot;the term seems to belong not so much to the earliest, heroic phase of the epics&#x27; development as to the next, more aesthetically and even romantically motivated phase and in fact to have become much less common by the next phase again (that of the &quot;Śānti&quot; and &quot;Anusāsana parvans&quot; of the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; and the &quot;Bāla&quot; and &quot;Uttara kāṇḍas&quot; of the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot;), with its more moral and religious emphasis&quot;.

==Origins and development==
The origins of the &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; are somewhat ambiguous, with scholars tracing the practice back to the early Vedic period (c. 1500–1100 BCE). Historian Hanns-Peter Schmidt suggests that its origins may lie in ancient Indic customs with parallels in Indo-European tradition, as seen in Zoroastrian Iran. In support of this, linguist Stephanie W. Jamison notes several indirect references to &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; in the &quot;Ṛg Veda&quot;, the oldest Hindu scripture, and suggests that the custom may have roots in the Indo-European tradition due to its similarity to the tale of Penelope and her many suitors in the Greek poem &quot;Odyssey&quot;. Alternatively, scholar Heramba Chatterjee Shashtri posits that &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; possibly emerged from the &quot;Gāndharva&quot; form of marriage prevalent in ancient India. The &quot;Gāndharva&quot; marriage, which was based on mutual consent and romantic choice, might have provided the conceptual foundation for the &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot;. This contrasts with other forms of marriage prevalent in ancient India, such as Arranged Marriage or Sacrificial Marriage. Shashtri further proposes that the development of &quot;svayaṃvaras&quot; unfolded in three phases—an early form akin to the &quot;gāndharva&quot; marriage, a second form endorsed by the &quot;Dharmashastras&quot;, and a third form which, aligning with the societal ideals of the &quot;kṣatriya&quot; class, saw the &quot;svayaṃvara&quot; evolve into a competitive event, where the bride&#x27;s choice was frequently influenced by a contest of skill or valour among suitors. Brockington adds a subsequent phase that developed after the contest style, placing greater emphasis on the bride&#x27;s agency and romantic ideals, as well as Dharmashastra&#x27;s ordinance to marry.

The Sanskrit &quot;Dharmashastras&quot;, the law books of Hinduism, such as the &quot;Manusmṛti&quot; (c. 1st century CE), permit a girl to choose her own husband if her father fails to arrange her marriage within three years after her first menses. Although this is very different from the ritualised and grand customs termed as &quot;Svayaṃvaras,&quot; many scholars consider it as a sub-type of the custom, granted to girls of all castes. Jamison finds the allowance for a girl to choose her husband in the &quot;Manusmṛti&quot; to be a significant contradiction within a legal code otherwise intent on enforcing female dependence, and raises the question of why such independence would be granted under a system aimed at preserving women’s dependence. Professor Arti Dhand clarifies this question through the concepts of &quot;pravṛtti dharma&quot; and &quot;nivṛtti dharma&quot;. In this framework, &quot;pravṛtti dharma&quot; encourages active participation in worldly life, placing high importance on the procreative potential of men and women. As Dhand explains, &quot;pravṛtti dharma&quot; seeks to maximise the reproductive capacity of individuals, revealing a driving logic behind the svayaṃvara: a practical emphasis on ensuring women’s marital and reproductive roles are fulfilled, particularly when their parents have neglected to arrange a timely marriage.

Many scholars, though accepting its existence in the Vedas, state that actual historical records of Svayaṃvara customs are rare, and they contend that by the early Common Era it functioned more as a literary device in the epics than as a commonly practiced tradition. In the epic narratives of the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; and &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot; (c. 500 BCE–500 CE), the &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; is depicted as a knightly, splendid, and festive ceremony, which, according to Indologist Edward W. Hopkins, is not an evolution from an earlier concept of self-choice granted to women, but rather a distinct form that developed during the epic period of Hinduism, possibly having Indo-European roots. Hopkins also believes that the &quot;svayaṃvara&quot; may have supplanted an earlier &quot;kṣatriya&quot; practice of bride abduction, a custom that could occur with or without the bride’s consent. According to Hartmut Scharfe, if the epic &quot;svayaṃvara&quot; reflects an authentic tradition among &quot;kṣatriyas&quot;, it may have served as a mechanism for alleviating political pressures associated with marriage alliances. In a social class where marriages were commonly arranged to secure political alliances, often with limited consideration for the preferences of the bride, the &quot;svayaṃvara&quot; allowed the woman a degree of autonomy in choosing her husband. Alternatively, she might yield to the outcome of a skill-based competition, which relieved her father of the responsibility of choosing a suitor, thereby avoiding potential conflicts with powerful neighbouring rulers.

In the epics, the grand Svayaṃvaras function as significant narrative devices leading to the marriages of several female protagonists. Brockington asserts that the original svayaṃvaras in these epics are centred on valour, such as Draupadi’s svayaṃvara, which was written in the early epic phase of the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, where Arjuna, disguised as a brāhmaṇa, wins her hand through an extraordinary display of archery skill. Brockington also observes that the story of Sāvitrī, where her father is unable to find her a husband, leading her to choose one herself, closely aligns with the practices outlined in the &quot;Dharmashastra&quot;. However, despite this similarity, the epic authors do not classify it as a &quot;svayaṃvara.&quot; The portrayal of svayaṃvara in the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot;, particularly regarding Sītā, shifts to a more religious and moral framework, emphasising the divinity of the protagonist Rāma. The concept of svayaṃvara continued to evolve in later Indian literature, often highlighting the bride’s autonomy or divine intervention. Stories such as those of Damayantī and Rukmiṇī, written in the later phase of the epic era, illustrate a shift towards individual agency and romantic ideals. Svayamvara remained as a significant plot device in many classical and mediaeval literature such as Kālidāsa’s &quot;Raghuvaṃśa&quot; and Chand Bardai&#x27;s Prithviraj Raso.

==Types==
Scholars tend to classify the self-choice ceremony in the Hindu literature into two broad categories:
* Svayaṃvara that provided the princess the freedom to choose her suitor from a host of assembled suitors up to her own liking with the parents&#x27; approval. It is also sometimes referred to as Saundaryaśulkā, and svayamvaras of Damayanti in the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; and Indumati in the &quot;Raghuvaṃśa&quot; fall under this category. Scholars such as Jaimison consider the Dharmashashtra version as a sub-type of this category.
* Vīryaśulkā refers specifically to a type of &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; where the bride is won through a contest of valor or strength, typically involving a heroic feat. It contrasts with the idea of a &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; where the bride might have more direct agency in choosing her partner. Draupadi, Ambā and her sisters in the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; or Sītā in the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot; chose their suitors in this form of svayamvara. Notably, scholars note that &quot;Vīryaśulkā&quot; appears as a distinct sub-type of &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot;, emphasizing the heroic or martial qualities of the suitor, rather than the bride&#x27;s choice.

According scholar Vettam Mani, the scripture &quot;Devī Bhāgavatapurāṇa&quot; classifies &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; into three types. The first, Icchā Svayaṃvara, allowed the bride complete freedom to choose her husband based on her preference. It involved an assembly at which the bride-to-be simply chooses between her suitors, with Damayantī’s &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; being a prime example. The second type, Savyavasthā Svayaṃvara, required the suitor to meet specific qualifications, such as Rāma drawing the bow of Śiva to win Sītā. The third type, Śauryaśulka Svayaṃvara, involved a contest or challenge for the bride’s hand, exemplified by Arjuna’s marriage to Draupadī.

==Structure and Symbolism==
Svayamvara was conducted after a royal girl reached puberty, or attained maidenhood. In Sanskrit literature, the svayamvara follows a highly structured sequence, as outlined by Linguist Stephanie Jamison:
# Invitation, Assembly, and Entertainment of Suitors: The King, also the father of the bride, formally invite and host eligible suitors, creating a public platform for the marriage selection.
# Bride’s Public Display: The bride is ceremoniously presented, often adorned to signal her eligibility and social standing.
# Proclamation of Suitors: Each suitor is formally introduced, with announcements detailing their family backgrounds and qualifications.
# Contest Announcement (in Vīryaśulka Svayamvaras): In cases where a contest is involved, its nature and requirements are publicly declared.
# Execution of the Contest: Suitors undertake feats of valor or skill, such as archery or combat, to demonstrate their worthiness.
# Bride’s Choice: The bride signifies her selection by placing the ceremonial garland on the chosen suitor, finalizing her decision in front of the gathered assembly.
While the svayamvara was not a marriage itself, it marked the woman’s selection of a partner, and additional rites often followed to formalize the union. Draupadi’s svayamvara with the Pandavas in the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; and Indumati’s in Kālidāsa’s &quot;Raghuvaṃśa&quot; both culminate in &quot;kanyādāna&quot;-style weddings. This suggests that, in many contexts, svayamvara served as a preliminary selection process that required subsequent marriage rites to formalize the union in line with social expectations.

Scholars observe that the svayamvara format appears to be restricted to royal daughters of the Kshatriya caste. However, a few instances of inter-caste unions are recorded, though these often led to conflict and disapproval. Historian Romila Thapar notes that svayamvaras were frequently seen as status symbols among royal families, who used them to enhance their social standing. Thapar argues that marriage into a prestigious family was essential because such alliances legitimised claims to land, political power, and further connections. The svayaṃvara ceremony, although appearing to grant the woman agency in choosing her husband, was structured to fit patriarchal norms; it was essentially a ritual in which the woman was ‘gifted’ in marriage. This ceremony underscored the role of the kṣatriya as a primary giver of gifts. According to scholars, the &quot;svayamvara&quot; was also a potential source of conflict and violence in many cases, often placing the bride’s family in a precarious situation. Rejected suitors were sometimes hostile, and tales of retaliatory violence are prominent in epic and classical poetry. For example, after Indumatī’s &quot;svayamvara&quot; in Kālidāsa’s &quot;Raghuvaṃśa&quot;, suitors ambush the newlyweds, leading to a dramatic confrontation resolved only by the bridegroom’s strategic use of a magic arrow.

Scholars also observe that, despite its literal meaning, most &quot;svayaṃvaras&quot; did not provide complete freedom of choice to the bride. According to Shakambari Jayal, &quot;svayaṃvara&quot; may have allowed for some degree of preference rather than full autonomy in choosing a spouse. According to Schmidt, despite the ceremony’s premise of self-choice, it is apparent in many literary accounts that the choice was sometimes predetermined or at least heavily influenced by the family. In agreement with Schmidt, Jamison warns that the term &quot;svayamvara&quot; misleadingly suggests the girl has independent control, whereas her autonomy is significantly restricted. The father manages the proceedings, including inviting suitors and determining their eligibility. Few svayamvaras genuinely allow for free choice; instead, they typically follow the vīryaśulka model, where suitors compete in tests of valor set by the father, culminating in the girl selecting a &quot;winner.&quot; This process resolves the father&#x27;s concerns but leaves little room for the daughter’s independent decision-making.

== &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; in the &quot;Ṛg Veda&quot; ==
The &quot;Ṛg Veda&quot;, being one of the oldest and most enigmatic texts in Indian literature, provides limited direct evidence for &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot;. Some scholars, such as Hanns-Peter Schmidt, argue that the evidence is too indirect and that the &quot;Ṛg Veda&quot; does not provide a clear picture of the &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; as an established institution. He suggests that the Ṛg Vedic poets may have been more concerned with cosmic and symbolic themes than with depicting real social institutions. Schmidt proposed that though svayamvara is not present in the Vedas, but the custom reflects an older Indic custom with Indo-European parallels, particularly in Zoroastrian Iran. However, scholars such as Stephanie W. Jamison, suggest that the &quot;Ṛg Veda&quot; contains indirect references to &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; through specific words and phrases that indicate the presence of this institution. One of the key terms she discusses is &quot;&quot;vrá&quot;-&quot;, which she proposes might be a syncopated form of a feminine noun corresponding to the masculine &quot;varū-&quot;, meaning &quot;suitor&quot; or &quot;chooser.&quot; This term could refer to a &quot;female chooser,&quot; implying a woman who selects her husband, which aligns with the concept of &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot;.

For example, Jamison analyzes the phrase &quot;svayaṃ sā varūte&quot; (she chooses for herself) as a possible underlying expression in the &quot;Ṛg Veda&quot;. Although this formula does not appear overtly in the text, Jamison argues that it might exist in a more subtle, encoded form, suggesting that the concept of a maiden choosing her own husband was known in Vedic society.

===The Marriage of Sūryā===

One of the most compelling pieces of evidence for the &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; in the &quot;Ṛg Veda&quot; is found in the marriage of Sūryā, the daughter of the Sun. This myth, which is prominently featured in the Ṛg Vedic marriage hymn (X.85), serves as a divine model for human marriage and is often interpreted as reflecting a &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; scenario. In this hymn, Sūryā is depicted as choosing her husband from among the gods, with the twin Aśvins being her primary suitors. Jamison points out that the repeated references to Sūryā&#x27;s choice, the involvement of the Aśvins, and the emphasis on the chariot (a key element in the wedding) suggest a ritualized form of &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot;. She also notes that the &quot;Ṛg Veda&quot; uses the verb &quot;vṛṇīta&quot; (chooses) in contexts that imply a maiden’s active selection of her husband, further supporting the idea of &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot;.

The &quot;Ṛg&quot; Vedic poets often engage in formulaic play and metonymy, where different elements are substituted within a familiar formula. For example, in some hymns, the &quot;chariot&quot; of the Aśvins is chosen instead of the suitors themselves, indicating the close association between the vehicle and the husband in the wedding ritual. This kind of metonymic substitution suggests that the concept of choice (central to &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot;) was so embedded in the culture that it could be creatively manipulated by the poets.

===Other instances===
Jamision also cites that the passage the wedding of Sarañyu, mentioned in Rigveda 10.17.1, is a clear example of &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot;.

James Talboys Wheeler also recognised the presence of &quot;Svayaṃvaras&quot; in the Ṛg Veda, citing the example of &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; of Sūryā and Vimada. Ancient scholar Sāyaṇa explains that Vimada, a young sage, was chosen by Princess Kamadhyu during her svayaṃvara ceremony. However, envious suitors attacked the couple as they returned to Vimada’s home. Vimada then invoked the Ashvins, who intervened to save them. Chatterjee suggests that this instance of svayaṃvara bears a striking resemblance to those found in the epics.

== &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; in the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; ==
The &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, with its extensive narrative scope, features numerous instances of &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot;, predominantly associated with female protagonists of noble lineage. &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; appears approximately 23 times in the &quot;Ādiparvan&quot; (the first book of the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;), 15 times in the &quot;Vanaparvan&quot;, 6 times in the &quot;Udyogaparvan&quot;, 3 times in the &quot;Dronaparvan&quot;, 2 times in the &quot;Sāntiparvan&quot;, and 1 time each in the &quot;Sabha&quot;, &quot;Bhīṣmaparvan&quot;, and &quot;Anusāsanaparvans&quot;.

=== Draupadī’s &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; ===

Draupadī’s &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; is the most famous instance in the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;. Textual references in the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; provide a detailed account of this event. The &quot;Ādiparvan&quot; describes the preparation for the &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot;, the gathering of suitors, and the specific details of the contest (Mbh. 1.174-185). Draupadī herself refers to the event in later parts of the epic, indicating its lasting importance in her life and the broader story (Mbh. 2.62.4a).

Draupadī is the daughter of King Drupada of Pāñcāla. King Drupada organizes a &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; to find a suitable husband for his daughter. He sets up a rigorous contest to determine Draupadī’s future husband. The central challenge involves a massive bow that must be strung and used to shoot an arrow at a revolving target while looking at its reflection in water kept beneath—a task requiring extraordinary strength, precision, and focus. The event attracts princes and warriors from across the land, including the Kauravas, Karṇa, and the Pandavas (who are in disguise). Among the competitors, Karṇa, known for his unmatched archery skills, steps forward to attempt the challenge. However, Draupadī, who is granted a degree of choice in the matter, rejects Karṇa, citing his low birth as a &quot;sūta&quot; (charioteer), though this scene is not universally agreed upon in various recensions of the text. There are variations regarding Karṇa&#x27;s participation; many renditions of the text describe him failing to string the bow by the &quot;breadth of a hair&quot;. 

Arjuna, disguised as a Brahmin (priest caste), then takes up the challenge. Despite his incognito appearance, Arjuna&#x27;s inherent skill and divine favor enable him to accomplish the task with ease. He successfully strings the bow and hits the target, winning Draupadī&#x27;s hand in marriage. The victory of Arjuna, a Kṣatriya warrior disguised as a Brahmin, sparks outrage among the other suitors, particularly the Kauravas and Karṇa. Upon returning to their mother Kuntī with Draupadī, Arjuna and his brothers inadvertently place her in a situation where she becomes the common wife of all five Pandavas. This unusual marital arrangement, while rooted in a misunderstanding, is sanctioned by divine and scriptural reasoning within the epic. Draupadī’s marriage to the Pandavas is not only integral to the plot but also symbolizes unity and shared responsibility among the brothers.

The significance of Draupadī’s &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; extends far beyond the mere act of marriage. It acts as a pivotal catalyst for the myriad conflicts that propel the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;&#x27;s narrative. This event intensifies the resentment of the Kauravas and Karṇa towards the Pandavas, laying the groundwork for the rivalry that ultimately leads to the great Kurukṣetra war. Moreover, Draupadī’s &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; underscores profound themes of fate, dharma, and divine intervention in human affairs. Her marriage to the Pandavas is not just a personal union but a fulfillment of a destiny intricately shaped by her past life and divine will. The &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; also varies significantly across different recensions, reflecting the influence of local cultural contexts and the specific narrative priorities of diverse communities. For instance, some South Indian versions might place greater emphasis on divine intervention and Kṛṣṇa&#x27;s role, whereas northern recensions may highlight different aspects. In certain versions, the focus might be on Draupadī’s autonomy and the implications of her marriage to the five Pandavas, while others might concentrate on the political ramifications of the &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot;, especially in relation to the Kauravas.

Scholars like J.L. Brockington and V.S. Sukthankar emphasize that Draupadī&#x27;s &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; is a quintessential example of the Kṣatriya ideal of heroism and valor. The contest where Arjuna wins Draupadī’s hand by hitting a target reflects the epic’s emphasis on martial prowess. Alf Hiltebeitel highlights the mythological and ritual symbolism of Draupadī’s &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot;, interpreting it as a key event that reinforces Draupadī’s central role in the cosmic and dharmic order of the epic. M.J. Kashalikar adds that different cultural and religious retellings, such as Jain texts, portray the &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; with variations, reflecting diverse interpretations of her role. V.S. Sukthankar notes that few aspects of Draupadī’s &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot;, although potentially a later addition, is structurally essential to the epic, setting the stage for the conflicts and alliances that drive the narrative.

=== Damayantī’s &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; ===

Damayantī’s &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; is another prominent instance in the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;. Her story is distinct within the epic because it involves not just one, but two &quot;Svayaṃvaras&quot;, illustrating that &quot;Svayaṃvaras&quot; could be held more than one time for a bride. Textual references in the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; provide a detailed account of Damayantī’s &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot;. The episodes involving her first &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot;, her interactions with the gods, and her recognition of Nala are found in the &quot;Vana Parva&quot; (Mbh. 3.51-62), while the second &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; and her reunion with Nala are described in the later sections of the same parva (Mbh. 3.68-72).

The first &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; of Damayantī is organized by her father, King Bhīma, after he becomes aware of her deep affection for Nala, the king of Nishadha. Damayantī, having heard of Nala&#x27;s virtues and character through messengers, falls in love with him even before meeting him. Nala, equally enchanted by the descriptions of Damayantī, also desires to marry her. King Bhīma invites kings and princes from across the land to participate in the &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot;. Among the suitors are not only human princes but also several gods who have disguised themselves as Nala to win Damayantī’s hand. The gods include Indra, Agni, Varuṇa, and Yama, who, despite their divine status, are unable to sway Damayantī’s heart away from Nala. When the time comes for her to make her choice, Damayantī, guided by her unwavering love, identifies Nala among the disguised gods. Her devotion is so strong that even the gods, recognizing her steadfast love and purity, bless the union instead of opposing it. Thus, Damayantī chooses Nala as her husband.

The second &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; occurs under much different circumstances and is unique in the epic&#x27;s context. After a series of misfortunes that lead Nala to abandon Damayantī, she is left heartbroken and alone. Believing Nala to be dead, and faced with the prospect of life without him, Damayantī decides to organize another &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot;. However, this time, the purpose is not merely to find a new husband but to uncover whether Nala is still alive. The conditions she sets for this &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; are such that only Nala, disguised as Bahuka, can fulfill them. During the event, Damayantī recognizes Nala despite his disguise, and it restores their marriage and reaffirms their bond.
Damayantī’s &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; is significant for several reasons. It is one of the rare instances in the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; where the bride’s personal choice is crucial to the marriage. Unlike other &quot;Svayaṃvaras&quot; that emphasize the suitors&#x27; valor or the father&#x27;s decision, Damayantī’s choice is driven by love and personal conviction. Secondly, the involvement of the gods in her first &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; underscores the theme of divine intervention in human affairs, a common motif in the &quot;Mahābhārata;&quot; but unlike other instances, the gods are treated as antagonists in her story. Thirdly, the second &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; demonstrates Damayantī&#x27;s resourcefulness and determination. Faced with the possibility of losing her husband forever, she takes active steps to uncover the truth and restore her marriage, showing both agency and resilience. This second &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; also adds depth to her character, portraying her not just as a passive recipient of fate but as an individual capable of shaping her destiny.

Scholars describe it as a &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; true to its literal meaning, where the bride enjoys full autonomy without paternal influence. They have noted that Damayantī’s &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; exemplifies this ideal, with Thomas Parkhill discussing its romanticized narrative. Parkhill highlights that Damayantī’s love for Nala, established before the &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; through hearsay, introduces a personal and emotional dimension, shifting from traditional heroic ideals to a more individualistic and romantic view. Brockington views this &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; as a transitional phase in the portrayal of &quot;Svayaṃvaras&quot;, contrasting with Draupadī’s focus on martial prowess.

=== &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; of princesses of Kāśī===
The narrative of the Kāśī princesses—Ambā, Ambikā, and Ambālikā—particularly appears in the &quot;Ādiparvan&quot; (Book of Beginnings) and the &quot;Udyogaparvan&quot; (Book of Effort). The Kāśī princesses are expected to choose their husbands in their joint ceremony. Bhīṣma, the grand-uncle of the Kuru princes, attends the &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; on behalf of his younger brother Vicitravīrya, who is too young and inexperienced to win a bride in combat. At the &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot;, Bhīṣma overpowers all the suitors and forcibly takes the three princesses back to Hastināpura. This action aligns with the Rākṣasa form of marriage, where a bride is taken by force after defeating her other suitors. Upon their return, Ambā, the eldest sister, reveals that she was already in love with Śālva, the king of Saubha, and had intended to marry him. Hearing this, Bhīṣma, adhering to his vow of celibacy, allows Ambā to go to Śālva. However, when Ambā reaches Śālva, he rejects her, citing his dishonor in being defeated by Bhīṣma. Left without a place or purpose, Ambā returns to Hastināpura, only to be refused by Bhīṣma, who tells her that she cannot marry Vicitravīrya after having declared her love for another man. This event leads Amba to vow revenge against Bhīṣma, which becomes a significant subplot in the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;.

The &quot;Svayaṃvaras&quot; of the Kāśī princesses, particularly Ambā, are pivotal in the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;. Ambā&#x27;s confusion about whether her &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; was meant for free choice or as a contest of strength leads to her later resentment and tragic conflict with Bhīṣma. Unlike Ambikā and Ambalikā, who do not object to marrying Bhīṣma&#x27;s brother, Vichitravīrya, Ambā voices her objections only after reaching Bhīṣma&#x27;s home. This discrepancy turns the &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; into a focal point for assigning blame, with Amba grappling with responsibility—whether it lies with herself, her father, Bhīṣma, or Śālva. The text suggests that the failed expectations of the &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; and Śālva’s inability to win play significant roles in Amba’s misfortune, highlighting the limited autonomy of the princesses, who are portrayed as passive in their destinies.

Scholarly assessments characterize this event as a violent assertion of power rather than a genuine &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; where the bride has true choice. Bhīṣma’s actions disrupt the conventional contest among suitors, and he justifies his actions by prioritizing the Kṣatriya right to seize brides by force over the &quot;Svayaṃvara’s&quot; intended purpose. This reflects the tension between dharma and heroic ideals, with Bhīṣma’s actions having significant consequences for Amba, who later seeks revenge and becomes Śikhaṇḍī, playing a crucial role in Bhīṣma&#x27;s death. Vanita Ruth discusses how Amba’s story illustrates the limitations of women’s agency and the tragic outcomes of male-dominated decisions and emphasizes how women were often treated as prizes in political and familial strategies.

=== Other instances ===
In addition to the previously listed more famous instances, several other instances of Svayaṃvara are attested in the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;. Kuntī participated in a Svayaṃvara arranged by her father, where she chose Pāṇḍu as her husband out of the crowd of suitors. Devakī, the mother of Kṛṣṇa, had a Svayaṃvara that is mentioned in the epic, though details are sparse. Mādhavī, after being passed among various kings by Galava to fulfill a dakṣiṇā, had a Svayaṃvara, but chose instead to live in the forest and embrace ascetism. Subhadrā&#x27;s situation was also discussed in the context of Svayaṃvara, with Kṛṣṇa advising Arjuna to abduct (elope) her rather than rely on a traditional Svayaṃvara. Additionally, Devikā and Vijayā chose Yudhiṣṭhira and Sahadeva in their respective Svayaṃvara, while Bhīma won Valandharā&#x27;s hand in marriage at her &quot;Vīryaśulkā&quot;. The daughter of King Citrāngada of Kaliṅga, rejects the suitor Duryodhana (antagonist of the epic) by walking past him. Despite her clear refusal, Duryodhana, driven by pride and with help from Karṇa, forcibly abducts her. This event is notable as it is the only instance in the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; where a bride is taken against her will.
====Savitrī&#x27;s marriage====
Although not explicitly termed as Svayaṃvara, academics comment that the narrative of Sāvitrī&#x27;s marriage closely aligns with its principles. They discuss the &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; of Sāvitrī, along with Damayantī, as one of the more unusual and poignant instances of this practice, primarily because it closely adheres to the literal meaning of Svayaṃvara—self-choice—rather than the more common contest-based selection of a husband seen in other instances. In the story, when Savitrī, the renowned daughter of King Aśvapati of Mādra, reaches marriageable age, no suitor comes forward to ask for her hand, intimidated by her divine qualities and the virtue she possessed. Her father, concerned by this, instructs her to find a husband herself—a directive that perfectly aligns with the etymological essence of the term &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot;. Savitrī travels on a chariot alone in search of a suitable match, which is unusual given the strict societal norms for women. Finally she finds her match in Satyavan, the son of a blind, exiled king. This &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; is seen as an early and exceptional form, possibly reflecting an older tradition of more genuine female autonomy in marriage choices. This episode may reflect the Dharmaśāstra influence, where Svayaṃvara becomes a regulated means to ensure matrimonial compliance, diverging from the valor-centric Kṣatriya tradition.

===In &quot;Harivaṃśa&quot;===
The &quot;Harivaṃśa&quot; is a significant Sanskrit text that serves as an appendix to the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, providing additional details about the lives of the Yādava dynasty and the divine aspects of the Kṛṣṇa&#x27;s life. It expands upon and complements the main narrative of the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; by offering enriched stories and supplementary episodes, thus playing a crucial role in the development of the epic&#x27;s overarching themes and characters.

In the &quot;Harivamśa&quot;, the portrayal of Svayaṃvara reveals an evolving narrative that emphasizes female autonomy. The text provides accounts of two significant Svayaṃvaras involving members of the Yādava dynasty. Rukmiṇī&#x27;s Svayaṃvara, found in Appendix 20, though unconventional, involved her being abducted by Kṛṣṇa, whom she had already chosen in her heart. Rukmi’s daughter (Rukmiṇī&#x27;s niece) held a Svayaṃvara where she selected Pradyumna, Kṛṣṇa&#x27;s son, as her husband.

==Svayaṃvara in the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot;==
In contrast to the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;, Svayaṃvara in the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot; is less frequent, with the term appearing six times in the entire epic four in &quot;Ayodhyākāṇḍa&quot;, and one each in the &quot;Bālakāṇḍa&quot; and the &quot;Yuddhakāṇḍa&quot;. The &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot; emphasizes the moral and divine aspects of marriage, contrasting with the more martial and heroic portrayal in the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;.
===Sītā’s Svayaṃvara===

Sītā’s Svayaṃvara is a critical event in the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot;, narrated in the &quot;Ayodhyākāṇḍa&quot; of the text. Organized by King Janaka of Mithilā, the Svayaṃvara was designed to find a suitable husband for Sītā, Janaka&#x27;s daughter, who was renowned for her beauty, virtue, and divine origin. The challenge set for the suitors was to string and break a colossal bow, Pināka, which had once belonged to Lord Śiva. This bow was so formidable that none of the assembled princes and warriors from various kingdoms could even lift it, let alone string and break it.

The arrival of Rāma, the prince of Ayodhyā, at the Svayaṃvara marked a turning point in the event. Accompanied by his brother Lakṣmaṇa and the sage Viśvāmitra, Rāma stepped forward at Viśvāmitra’s encouragement. To the astonishment of everyone present, Rāma effortlessly lifted the bow, strung it, and broke it in half, thereby winning Sītā&#x27;s hand in marriage. This act was not only a demonstration of Rāma’s physical strength but also a clear indication of his divine favor and destiny as the upholder of dharma. Following Rāma’s success, King Janaka was overjoyed and immediately offered Sītā to Rāma. However, Rāma, in adherence to the cultural norms of the time, sought the permission of his father, King Daśaratha of Ayodhyā, before accepting Sītā as his wife. Once Daśaratha gave his consent, the marriage was arranged with great ceremony, marking the union of two of the most revered figures in Hindu tradition.

The Svayaṃvara of Sītā holds significant importance in the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot; for several reasons. Firstly, it highlights Rāma’s role as a divinely ordained hero, whose actions are guided by higher powers. His victory in the contest is portrayed as not just a feat of strength but as a fulfillment of his destiny. Secondly, the event reinforces the cultural values of the time, particularly the emphasis on strength and valor in choosing a husband, as well as the father’s role in arranging marriages. The bow of Śiva, central to the contest, symbolizes the weight of dharma, which Rāma, as an avatar of Vishnu, is destined to uphold. Textual references from the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot; underscore the significance of this event. Sītā, when recounting her marriage to Anasūyā later in the epic, refers to it as a Svayaṃvara, emphasizing the traditional elements of choice and valor that defined the event (Rām. 2.110.47-52). Additionally, the description of the bow and the challenge it posed is detailed in the &quot;Bālakāṇḍa&quot; of the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot;, where Janaka explicitly states that Sītā will marry only the man who can string the bow (Rām. 1.65-70).

Scholars note that the account of Sītā’s Svayaṃvara is presented differently in various parts of the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot;, leading to inconsistencies. Specifically, Robert Goldman points out that while Sītā herself refers to her marriage as a Svayaṃvara in the Ayodhyākāṇḍa, the earlier Bālakāṇḍa presents the event with different details, with the Bālakāṇḍa focusing more on the heroic aspect of the contest and the Ayodhyākāṇḍa presenting a more romanticized and dhārmic version of the events. The word Svayaṃvara is never used in the Bālakāṇḍa; instead, the term &quot;vīryaśulka&quot; (prize of heroism) is repeatedly used to describe Sītā. This term contrasts with Sītā’s later description of her marriage as a Svayaṃvara in the Ayodhyākāṇḍa, where the emphasis is on her being given away by her father, Janaka. Goldman argues that Sītā&#x27;s recounting in the Ayodhyākāṇḍa does not align perfectly with the events as they are narrated in the Bālakāṇḍa, indicating that the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot; may have undergone textual evolution, with later additions or modifications affecting the consistency of the narrative.

===Other instances===
Another instance is the Svayaṃvara of the daughters of King Kuśanābha, mentioned in the Balakāṇḍa of the &quot;Rāmāyaṇa&quot;. When approached by the god Vāyu, the daughters refuse his advances, stating that their father will arrange their Svayaṃvara. This episode emphasizes the father&#x27;s role in deciding marriage, with the daughters showing obedience to patriarchal norms. This Svayaṃvara does not actually result in a contest but underscores the theme of parental control over marriage choices, contrasting with the supposed freedom of choice implied in the Svayaṃvara tradition.

In the same section, the Rāmāyaṇa tells the tale of Somadā, a Gandharvī who persuades the sage Cūlina to marry her. While not a Svayaṃvara in the traditional sense, this story reflects a different form of marriage, where the woman takes the initiative, showing a variation on the theme of marriage choice.

==Svayaṃvara in &quot;Dharmaśāstra&quot; and other &quot;Smṛti&quot; literature==
Scholars note that Svayaṃvara is conspicuously absent from the traditional lists of eight marriage types in the &quot;Dharmaśāstra&quot;, such as the &quot;Manusmṛti&quot;, though a version of it is described in the texts. Brockington also comments that absence of Svayaṃvara in the list has led to the classification of it as the ninth form of marriage. P.V. Kane and Heramba Chatterjee suggest that the Svayaṃvara may have been a later addition to the canon of marriage practices, possibly arising from less formalized traditions like the &quot;Gāndharva&quot; marriage, a form of marriage recognized in &quot;Smṛti&quot; literature that is based on mutual consent and affection.

Ludwik Sternbach explains that the ordinary Svayaṃvara in &quot;Smṛti&quot; literature is not a formalized or celebrated event as seen in epics but rather a legal provision that grants a maiden the right to choose her husband under specific circumstances. distinguishing it from the more celebrated and dramatic Svayaṃvaras depicted in ancient Indian epics. Sternbach identifies an &quot;ordinary Svayaṃvara&quot; within the &quot;Smṛti&quot; texts, which is not a grand public event but rather a legal provision that allows a maiden the right to choose her husband if her father or guardian fails to arrange her marriage within a specified period after she reaches puberty. This period, as outlined in various &quot;Smṛtis&quot; such as the &quot;Manusmṛti&quot; and &quot;Yājñavalkya Smṛti&quot;, is generally three years or three menstrual cycles. Sternbach explains that this provision underscores the practical concerns of ensuring timely marriages and the importance of procreation in ancient Indian society, which viewed remaining unmarried as socially and religiously undesirable.

In terms of conditions and restrictions, Sternbach notes that while the ordinary Svayaṃvara grants the maiden some autonomy, her choice is still governed by societal expectations. The &quot;Smṛtis&quot; require that the chosen husband be of equal caste and rank, blameless in character, and suitable in terms of family background, age, health, and other qualities. This ensures that even though the woman is exercising her right to choose, her choice aligns with and reinforces the established social hierarchy. The ordinary Svayaṃvara thus serves as a corrective measure, allowing a woman to marry if her guardian fails in his duties, but still within a controlled framework that upholds social order.

Sternbach also draws a connection between the ordinary Svayaṃvara and the &quot;Gāndharva vivāha&quot;. He suggests that the ordinary Svayaṃvara is closely linked to this concept, reflecting similar values of personal choice and agency. However, the &quot;Smṛtis&quot; emphasize that this autonomy is exercised within limits, ensuring that the marriage conforms to societal norms. Sternbach further discusses how the Smṛtis provide practical guidelines on how a woman should proceed with her choice if she finds herself in this situation, including instructions on approaching the desired man and maintaining propriety throughout the process.
==In historical records==
Scholars note that most instances of Svayamvara are found in the epics, but actual historical cases are rare.

One notable historical reference to this practice appears in the Junagadh Rock Inscription of Rudradaman, dated to around AD 150. In this inscription, Rudradaman, a prominent ruler of the Western Kshatrapa dynasty, is praised not only for his military conquests and administrative achievements but also for his participation in &quot;svayaṃvaras&quot; of royal daughters.

In a later Persian source, the concept of svayamvara is presented within the context of a conflict between two brothers—Ramagupta and Chandragupta II (reigning from 375 to 415). The account reveals that Ramagupta abducted Dhruvadevi from her svayamvara, fully aware that she was in love with Chandragupta II. Subsequent verses recount how Chandragupta II ultimately killed Ramagupta and married Dhruvadevi.

The most famous example of &quot;Svayaṃvara&quot; in its historical context is the legendary tale of Prithviraja III, King of Sapadalaksha (1166 – 1192), and Sanyogita, the princess of Kanauj, as narrated in the semi-historical epic poem Prithvirajaraso, composed by the bard Chand Bardai.

== Similar Practices ==
=== Kitayun ===
The Shahnama of Ferdausi records a similar tradition in pre-Islamic Iran, of one &quot;Kitayun&quot;, eldest daughter of the Emperor of Constantinople, selecting the Iranian Gushtasp. With a view to procure a husband for one of his daughters, the Byzantine emperor determined to hold a grand assembly of illustrious and wise men for her to see and select from. She did not find a suitable husband in the first assembly, so a second one was held, where she placed the crown on Gushtasp&#x27;s head. Gushtasp, also known as Vishtaspa, returned to Iran with his bride and was crowned King.

Rum (literally &quot;Rome&quot;) was the common name used for the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire by Middle Eastern people.
